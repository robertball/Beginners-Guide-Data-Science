I made this yesterday for the first time - EXCELLENT!!!!!   Based on reviews I read I did the following: 1) used three sweet sausages and two hot ones (which I first cooked in my George Foreman Grille)  2) used 2 cloves of garlic, used 2 more cups of broth*(chicken),  3) used two cans of stewed tomatoes, 4) used 1 pkg of frozen spinach -- not fresh  5) added 1/2 cup of raw orzo noodles,  6) added 1 cubed potato,  7)added 1 chopped onion,  8) did not use the 1/4 teaspoon of salt.     *NOTE:  for the extra broth I make my own by using Herb-Ox Granulated VERY LOW SODIUM - only 5 grams of sodium per teaspoon compared to ca. 800 grams in the regular kind - 26 servings per jar.

This is our family's favorite soup.  We've made it a dozen times.  Be sure to buy sausage without the MSG to avoid the headaches and allergic reations.  I've made this substituting potatoes for beans, okra for zuchini, pintos for northern beans, adding rice, etc.  It always turns out delicious and satisfying.  Don't put the spinach in until the last few minutes so that it stays green and firmer.  Frozen is great, but make sure it's chopped.  The big, fat leaves don't work as well.     This soup also freezes well.  We had a pot of it last night that I had frozen two weeks ago.

I would give this recipe 6 stars if I could!  I make it at least once a month, even in the Summertime.  A few changes I've made over time:  I add a chopped onion and double the garlic.  I use HOT Italian sausage (do this if you like a little extra kick).  I use 3 cans of beef broth, and make sure it is LOW SODIUM--I think this is crucial to the success of the recipe, because it is too salty with regular broth.  Delete the 1/4 t salt altogether, unless you feel it needs it at the end.  You can always add salt, but you can't take it away.  I also add 1/2 C of small pasta, whatever I have on hand (macaroni works fine, or use something else to be more elaborate) at the end of the cooking time.  If you'd like to do this, make sure you cook the pasta before adding the spinach.  Karen--thank you for a recipe that has become a household staple for us!

Modest, unassuming ingredients that pack a punch of flavor for the unsuspecting taste tester.  I dislike reviewers who considerably change a recipe and then rate it on their modifications, but this time, I couldn't seem to help myself...  Doubled the recipe, and used one pound of hot and one of sweet sausage, extra clove of garlic, added celery, small red potatoes, cannelli beans as that's the only type I had on hand, diced canned tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic added and omitted the salt.  Turned off the heat and added thinly sliced zuchinni and the fresh spinach 10 minutes prior to serving.  Absolutely superb flavor!!!  Thanks Sallyjun for the submission!

Nice, basic recipe for the humble but delicious Minestrone, with plenty of wiggle room for your own creativity or to use whatever vegetables are to your liking or what you have on hand. I made my own beef broth and along with the sausage I included the beef from the meaty bones I used. Added celery, onions and mushrooms with the carrots, along with some Tuscan seasoning. I used cannellini beans since I prefer them, and at the end threw in ditalini pasta (about 1 c. uncooked) which I had cooked ahead of time so the pasta wouldn't absorb too much of the broth.  Instead of the canned tomatoes I used tomatoes I had put up from my garden. There really is no right or wrong when making Italian soups like this, and the fun thing about it is that it never turns out exactly the same way twice! Sometimes I like to add a glug of red wine, or maybe rice, or various shapes of soup pasta. I did use fresh spinach this time, but Swiss Chard or escarole are nice too! To truly be authentic, sprinkle each serving with good, freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese!

Wow!  Unbelievably good, even better than I thought it would be - a definite keeper and company-quality recipe.  In fact, I think this is the best recipe I've gotten from this site.  I added the browned sausage and the rest of the ingredients (plus an onion, a teaspoon of minced garlic - and red pepper instead of green) to the crockpot, and cooked it on low for 5 hours.  I seasoned it with oregano, parsley, and rosemary.  Then I stirred in a half cup or so cooked, drained ditalini before serving.  Served with garlic bread, of course, just wonderful.

Excellent!!  I don't have any idea what possessed me to make this soup.  It is nothing that I would normally be drawn to.  Well.. I love it!!  Most soups that I make take hours to cook.  Not this.. within the hour it was ready to eat and the house smelled wonderful.  Changes that I made:  I mixed both hot and mild sausage.  Added onion and extra garlic when browning meat.  Like others... I added additional can beef broth and tomatoe.  I eliminated the zuccini and any additional salt.  When I added the beans (which i never thought i'd like but they add a nice touch) I also added some very small pasta.  The result... delish!!!! Can't wait to serve it to my guests tomorrow!!!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I also use 1 extra can of broth and then add 1-2 cups of cooked pasta at the end.  I have also added a couple stalks of chopped celery which is very tasty as well.  Makes a great winter meal with toasted french bread and a glass of wine.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

Wow, this soup was really good.  I used this chicken sicilian sausage from Trader joes and a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed.  I also added a tblspn of italian seasoning.  I can't wait to make this again!

This soup was absolutely FABULOUS!  It is honestly probably the best homemade soup I have ever had in my life.  I chopped up an onion to cook with the garlic and sausage, as well as cheating and adding frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh the first time, and canned spinach the secong time.  It was still absolutely wonderful both times, and very filling.  GREAT!

This soup was absolutely fantastic. Very flavorful and colorful. I prepared it last night for my sister and brother-in-law and they wouldn't stop raving. This one definitely has a home in my recipe box.

At first I thought no way could this be so tasty. Yeah, it's packed with veggies and sausage but there are no herbs and seasoning, just salt and pepper. Then I made it exact to the recipe. I always like to do that first. Reviews are filled with people who will happily give 5 stars but change 35% of the recipe. So I made it...and it was great! It's a really quick and basic recipe but it yields a lot of flavor. It got a thumbs up from myself and my soup fanatic bf. You can dress it up or dress it down but either way it's a winner.

Very tasty...I added a chopped onion and used three hot sausages, two mild.  I loved it.  My husband said it was good, but I don't think he likes it as much as I do, so I will probably end up eating the rest of it myself which is ok with me!

This is a great Italian soup.  I would have given it more stars if I could.  I did make a few changes but not because it needed it.  My son really likes pasta so... I only used one zucchini, I added one more can of broth and added 1 cup of uncooked ditalini pasta.  It was a huge success with my family.  My husband told me several times how good it was.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thanks for a great soup recipe!

Another delicious soup that everyone loved!  I live in Germany, so I used a Wurst from the local Metzgerie.  I told them I was making Suppe and they picked one out for me!

I made this soup last night and it was FABULOUS.  My husband said it was by far the best new thing I've made in awhile.  Even my 8 year old raved about it.  I made a few changes based on my families likes/dislikes.  I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers (they won't last long!). I omited the spinich, beans and zucchini  but added in a whole chopped onion and a green pepper while browning the meat (I used HOT italian sausage instead of regular) as well as probably used about 5 cloves of garlic.  Instead of simmering on the stove, I then transferred it all to a crockpot with the various liquids. I also added chopped up potatoes to substitute for the starch from the beans and a large fresh garden tomato in big chunks . I put the crockpot on high until it started bubbling (about 2 hours) and then reduced to low for another few hours until the potatoes were tender.  We served with warm crusty french bread and it was WONDERFUL!  I have a feeling this will be replacing chili many cold nights this winter!

What a tasty, hearty soup! I made mine healthier by using Italian seasoned ground turkey and vegetable broth. I had some potatoes, so I diced them up and threw them in with the carrots. Some yellow squash was also another great addition. Highly recommend this recipe for a cold winter night.

love the recipe- but I do it southern style! collards instead of spinach, butter-beans, squash. As long as you use the foundation combo of Italian sausage + broth + tomatoes + greens you are good to go. I literally hunt around for anything veggie that needs to be used up, add whatever canned or frozen veggies I have on hand.  I also like to add a glass of red wine, pasta or quinoa, and more Italian seasoning. This freezes well, I freeze it in single servings and take it to lunch when the weather is dreary.

This is, without a doubt, the best soup I've ever had the pleasure to serve.  I add enough sausage to make sure every bite has a bite of sausage.  I also add Mexican Corn and Celery. My family and my co-workers request it regularly. I've probably made it 25-30 times since I discovered it three years ago.  It is delightful and fun to make. Dianna

This is a really good quick soup: the flavors of the Italian sausage combine with the beef stock to make a really rich tasting broth.  I recommend draining the sausage before adding the broth tho...

I made this with half sweet turkey sausage and half hot turkey sausage.  I wondered about the flavor combination of turkey sausage and beef broth, but the flavors came together really well in the last 5 minutes.  Please be sure to let the soup sit off the heat after the spinach goes in--that's when the flavors meld and the soup flavors really bloom.  We don't like mushy zucchini, so I cut mine into 1 inch pieces.  Really good, satisfying soup.

Delicious soup, my family loved it and I've already shared with a number of friends.  
Changed original recipe only slightly.  Made with spicy italian sausage, removed casing and cooked meatball sizes, doubled the garlic and included 2 tsp of italian seasoning.  Fabulous!

This is wonderful! Did make a few changes, used chicken broth, used 1/2 head of shredded cabbage in lieu of spinach. Was still delicious. Add several croutons in soup just before serving.

Awesome base recipe!  I really liked this soup. It seems like as long as you use this base of italian sausage, tomatoes beef broth and beans, then you can put in anything you like. I didn't have the right beans. so I used black beans. I didn't have zucchini or spinach, so I used 2 potatoes, an ear of corn, 2 stalks celery, a large bell pepper, and 1/2 c onion. still great. I used italian sausage bratwurst type sausage links and just browned them well and then cut them into slices. This made pretty circles of sausage in the soup. For the second time, day before Christmas when we have a crowd of people over, I'm using twice the veggies and broth and tomatoes and still just 1 lb of sausage and adding a bag of mezzaluna four cheese ravioli. I'm sure that will work too. (edited review-it worked fine with more veggies and small cheese filled ravioli, if you have a crowd and want to extend your soup!)

I had this soup recommended to me on here. I liked that it used a lot of vegetables I had in the house and the idea of adding spinach on top which I may try on other soups to add in some extra vegetables. But, I did not care for how salty it seemed from the broth and for the sausage. But, I have never liked soup with sausage, even at the restaurants, so it may just be personal taste. I wasn't going to add it, but other people were going to be eating it. I think I may have liked it more without the meat, a low sodium broth, and a little pasta.

This is absolutely fabulous!!  The only thing I added was black olives.  It was so good that 2 of us practically finished off the whole thing!  I suggest using spicy sausage, as it adds a lot more flavor.

This recipe is wonderful.  I did chop up an onion before I realized the recipe didn;t call for one.  So I added it anyway and the overall flavor was scrumptious.  I think I will leave out the spinach next time as I didn;t like the rather slimmy feel of it.  But this is definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic! I made this using a combination of mild italian sausage, habanero breakfast sausage and chorizo. Also added a bit of chopped onion with the garlic and used 4 cups of mixed fresh greens (instead of 2)that I had- spinach, collard greens and kale. Also added 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley. I'll just follow up with my wife wasn't going to eat this....I got a text later on that this is one of the best soups she's ever had!

The soup had loads of flavour and was quite easy to make however it wasn't something i would normally eat but as a soup and recipe still rates very high. I will try and vary the soup a little to make it more to my taste.

I made this recipe on a cold day and it really hit the spot. I increased the garlic to three cloves, added one small onion diced, decreased the zucchini to one, omitted the spinach, and added about a cup of cooked pasta (I added the pasta at the end of the cooking time). Next time, I think I might use hot italian sausage instead of mild to give it more zing. Thanks for sharing the recipe Karen.

Yummy! I used regular sausage and added red pepper flakes. Also I increased garlic and added an onion. I suggest omitting the spinach all together and put fresh kale in soup when you put it in your bowl. Very tasty!

I made a few adjustments...my husband hates cooked spinach and zucchini, but it was just wonderful anyway.  I put in some elbow macaroni...that just made it!    Don't you just love this website?????
Update:  I've made this many times since I wrote this review.  It is still one of our favorites.  It's quick, easy and you always have most things on hand. I cook the pasta separately and just add it before serving.  Great even for guests....they always ask for the recipe.

Excellent.  Loved this soup. Not draining the beans, gave it just the right thickness. Used half extra lean beef and half hot italian sausage and it was the perfect heat. Used chicken broth instead of beef broth for a lighter taste.

Delicious!  Spicy sausage was too much for my husband, but I thought it delicious.  An easy to make, healthy soup. (I took the sausage out of the casing to cook with the garlic and drained it after it was cooked.  I cooked it an extra 15 min. with liquids before I added the carrots.)  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I did add a little cooked orzo as some suggested.   Will be making again with sweet sausage.

Delicous and hearty soup. Easy to make and has a wonderful flavor.  I would definitely serve this to company. Next time I would use 1 1/2 lbs of sausage as I prefer more meat in every bite.  Otherwise it was perfect.

This is such a great soup! I served it at a dinner a while ago and it was literally the hit of the party.  I'm having another dinner party this weekend and have tripled the recipe, so it's for 18 people. It definitely holds up!

I use 1/3 Hot Italian sausage and 2/3 Mild Italian Sausage. The spicy sausage gives it a little extra kick and really makes it top-notch.

When I suggested this for dinner my husband turned up his nose. When it was done and he saw and smelled what the kids and I were eating, he changed his mind. It is now one of our favorite winter soups and its good for you too. Try it with freshly grated parmesan cheese on top. Mmmm!

This soup is delicious and is a hit with the entire family!  As others had suggested, I added a small chopped onion and used 1/2 mild/sweet and 1/2 hot turkey sausage.  Otherwise, I followed the original recipe.  This recipe is definitely a "keeper" and will be made on a frequent basis.

A great soup! I needed to add significantly more broth because of my additional add-ins (cooked elbows, sauteed onions, celery), along with everything else (sausage, carrots, zucchini, spinach, beans) so plan accordingly. I also found after adding all the beef broth the tomato flavor had diminished so I poured in some Spicy V-8 juice - gave it a kick! Also added dried oregano and coarse pepper - no additional salt. Hope it freezes well - it makes plenty!

I made a few changes:  used chicken broth, red pepper flakes instead of black pepper, chopped a few plum tomatoes.  I was very excited because the soup looked great & appetizing.  The only problem is only a few people went for it.  Those who did... loved it.

I have made this soup so many times, I can't count.  Chicken broth works better for me, but that's just my preference.  Mix hot and sweet sausage.  Now that cold weather is here, make this, and I defy you to eat just one bowl.  Can't be done...gotta go for seconds.

This soup was an afterthought to fill out a rather skimpy meal. Except for the beans, which a reviewer suggested could be replaced by potatoes, I had all the other ingredients. As my Italian sausages were all hot I was unsure of the level of spicy heat. I needn't have worried. The soup was absolutely perfect. A great balance of all the flavours. What a wonderful surprise. The soup disappeared in one night so it's on the menu again tonight and will be shared with an under the weather friend and her family. Thanks so much for sharing this one SALLYJUN.
*29 October 2015. It's been a long time since preparing this recipe.
Funny how such a a good recipe can be forgotten. Perhaps, like many,  it's a matter of being busy with the usual goings on of life.  Plus I really enjoy discovering new recipes to try.
I've just made this soup and wanted to say that it's as good, if not better,  on this rather chilly Canadian autumn  day.  My kitchen smells so good. I can hardly wait for dinner.

Amazing soup - eating it as I type and can't wait for second helpings.  Recipe made even simpler by using my slow cooker. Browned the Italian sausage beforehand, then threw everything in the slow cooker on low for six hours.  Added onion and extra garlic.  Also substituted frozen chopped spinach for fresh.  Finally, in order to prevent the zucchini from becoming mushy I added it to the slow cooker in the last half hour.

THIS IS THE BEST SOUP EVER!  Period.  The only changes I made was to add chopped onion and I used frozen spinach instead of fresh.  Absolutely superb.  I cannot wait to serve this to my "Marie Barone" of an Italian mom and watch her reaction.  I think she might even ask for the recipe!

My hubby loved it! Even though i hate carrots i didn't mind eating them in this soup. I tried to stick as closely to the recipe as i could. I only made minor changes like spicy Italian sausage and fresh spinach.

Delicious, fast, and spicy with added Old Bay seasoning. I also left out the beans and added more onion, bell pepper, & potatoes. The fresh spinach added was amazing!

I've made this soup several times and everyone I serve it to loves it. I toss in a handful of farfalle  (bow tie) pasta, add about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and omit the salt. Other than that I follow the original recipe. Delicious!!

What a wonderful soup!  I was a bit skeptical because of the lack of herbs and seasoning, however the flavor was outstanding!  To make it a bit healthier, I used low fat turkey Italian sausage.  Definitely a keeper!  I did add more garlic and extra broth along with half a cup of orzo pasta.  I finished the first batch a couple days ago and I'm making more today!

This was so easy and really delicious. My husband isn't even fond of a couple of the ingredients but he loved it, and my toddler was a fan too! I did double the garlic as some of the reviews recommended, and added another cup or so of water. I also used spicy Italian chicken sausage. This is a new favorite!

this was awesome- and very easy to make.  I added a head of bok-choi chopped up, and used std green beans {not even sure what great northern are} and i used johnsonville sweet italian sausage which i boiled first, drained to get rid of some fat/grease, and sliced into inch thick chunks.  I could also see adding celery or any one of your favorite veggies-to add a twist each time you make it-  definitely a KEEPER.

Wow this soup is wonderful!  I made a few changes, based on other reviews and personal preferences, but I'm sure this would be great as written.  I used 1 link hot Italian sausage and 1 link of smoked sausage, because that is what I had.  I used a 28 oz, can of crushed tomatoes to give it a little more body and  added some Italian seasoning instead of the stewed tomatoes, but no salt added.  I used a 32 oz. box of beef broth.  I sauteed 1 chopped onion, the carrots and 3 cloves of garlic.  I added 1 cubed potato and 3/4 cup of small pasta along with the beans and zucchini.  I didn't have any fresh spinach so I used about 1/2 box frozen, squeezed out and chopped.  When it was done I sprinkled freshly grated parmesan.  It was absolutely delish!  I will be making this again and again!

This soup is fantastic!  I've made it 3 times in the past 6 weeks, and it's on next week's menu as well.  I did make one adjustment based on personal preference, but I subbed Kale for the Spinach.  It gives it a bit of a crunch instead of soft, wilted spinach.  After doing that, this soup really reminded me of the Olive Garden Toscana soup.  A+ for sure!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I wish that I would have used hot italian sausage.  Like others, I used frozen spinach.  I added celery, mushrooms, basil, oregano, extra salt, and one bay leaf.    In the future, I'll probably add a 13 bean soup mix.

Incredible soup! After reading some reviews, I followed the recipe as written and added 1/2 a diced onion and about 1/2 cup cooked macaroni to give the soup more substance. This was simple to make and tasted delightful. I'm sure I'll be making this over and over again!

Tastes really delicious! Even the boyfriend likes this one! I left out the ingredients that I don't care for, such as zucchini and cooked carrots, and it still left so much to savor and enjoy. Be sure to eat with bread or rice if you want it to fill you up as an entree...

I just threw all of the ingredients (except for the spinach, which went in later) in the crockpot for four hours and it turned out delicious! Much easier for a family on the go.

This soup is outstanding! The entire family enjoyed it, even my 3 year old. Like others, I made a few changes/additions to suit my family's tastes. I used 3 cloves of garlic, 32 oz. of broth, 2 large zucchini, an entire 10 oz. bag of spinach, and added a large onion, 1/2 cup red wine, and 1 tsp. each of basil and oregano. I love that this is a one pot meal which has plenty of leftovers. Thank you for the great recipe!!

The flavor was very good, so I'll give it 5 stars, but we thought it needed something extra, so next time I'll use 8 ounces of whole grain rotini. I used sweet turkey Italian sausage (added red pepper flakes for heat) and browned a yellow onion with it. I also used a whole pound of baby carrots and chicken broth, but otherwise the rest of the recipe stayed the same. I smashed one can of the beans to help thicken the broth, too. Thanks for the recipe! It would be good with lentils, too...

This soup is absolutely wonderful!!!  Tastes great on a chilly winter day - actually, it would taste good on any day!  I made a few changes:  I used ½ Spicy Italian and ½ regular sausage and added some chopped onion and extra garlic when I cooked the sausage.  I also used low sodium beef broth and I didn’t add the extra salt to the soup (that the actual recipe called for).  This soup was spectacular.  I will make this soup again and again…  Thanks!!!

I used 3 hot and 2 mild Italian Sausage links with casings removed.  Browned them in dutch oven sprayed with Pam and then cut them with spatula into chunks.  Added about 1 cup chopped onion and 3 cloves minced garlic.  Cooked this for a couple minutes and then added 2 cans Italian stewed tomatoes, the carrots and 4 cups chicken broth.  I added about 3 teaspoons beef base (I didn't have any beef broth) and 3 diced red potatoes.  Cooked this for about 20 minutes then added the zucchini and beans.  Cooked another 20 minutes or so and then added thawed frozen spinach and about 1/2 cup orzo.  Cooked another 20 minutes.  Turned heat off and let it sit for about an hour before eating.  TO DIE FOR GOOD!!!!!!!!!  Sorry about the changes, but I just couldn't resist adding onion!  The other small changes made for a delicious soup.  I'm sure it is good without these changes, but I will make it my way from now on as it was so good.  Thanks for the recipe!

definitely one of the best soups I've ever had.  I followed the advice of others and did not add any more salt.  I also used 1 zucchini and 1 c. celery as an addition.  I used 5 hot italian sausage to give a little kick, and 3 cans of beef broth.

Very good.  I used a box of frozen spinach instead of fresh and a can of pinto beans instead of great northern.  I added a peeled and cubed potato and also a chopped onion.  Mom and I loved all the veggie goodness.

I made this soup for dinner last night, and I have to say it is delicious. I made it pretty much the way the recipe is written however, I added chopped onion, chopped fresh oregano and basil, 4 cloves of garlic,and used diced tomatoes as that is what I had available.To give it a little kick I threw in some crushed red pepper, and omitted the salt as others suggested. I also added an extra cup of vegetable broth, in addition to the beef broth. This is definitely a keeper recipe and I look forward to  making this many more times.

Brilliant! I didn't have italian sausage so made a version using another recipe from this site. The zucchini , spinach and tomatoes make this a great source of veggies too. I skipped the beans but only because I didn't have them - will definitely put them in next time, since I'm sure I'll make it again!

This is so good. I added an extra can of beef broth plus a second can of northern beans. Used frozen chopped spinach and then topped each serving off with dried Parmesan cheese. We're having it again tonight. Only thing I noticed was it takes longer to make than I thought it would, but it's worth the time. This is now a regular meal for us--highly recommend! Update 1/3/11 -- Tonight made it with hot Italian sausage, not mild, and it was so much better with the hot. Before, it was a pleasant soup. Now, outtasight (do people even say that anymore? Mercifully, not often). ;0) Have left out the spinach the last 2 times I've made it; we couldn't really taste it, and don't miss it.

This soup turned out just OK for me and I followed the directions exactly.  It was fine, but I won't be making it again.  It didn't seem to really come together as a cohesive dish it seemed more like individual parts all in a pot together.

I've made this many many times.  There is no need to change things because it's wonderful as it is (though I never use stewed tomatoes because my family doesn't like them, just plain canned are good), but this is a very easy recipe to customize to your taste.   The last time I made it I doubled the recipe, but not the sausage, and added some celery and onions.  Delicious and low cal!

This was pretty good.  The only thing I didn't like was the gamey smell of the sausage.  I used mild italian sausage.  I also felt it needed more beans.  Next time I'll add 2 cans.

This recipe has been in my box for over two years, I finally made it. I have to say that when I tasted it early in the prep process I was less than thrilled. I felt as though it was a mistake making this. The finished product proved that wrong. All I can say is Wow! I did tweak it to my taste just a bit. First I more than doubled almost tripled the amount of water in it because the flavor was just so strong. I also added a few stalks of celery and two medium size onions. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. Next time I will not add ANY salt due to the content of salt in the sausage and beef broth. The spinach really brought the flavor home for me. The soup wouldn't be the same without it. This is for sure a keeper and this will be in a ton of people's email inbox  tomorrow morning.

Wow...all I have to say is fantastic!!  My husband said it was the best soup he's ever tasted.  Based upon personal preferences, next I think I'll omit the carrots and perhaps add some small potatoes.  I served with a nice salad and some french baguette bread - definitely a  keeper!

This is THE best soup i've ever made from a recipe! I'm more of a meat lover so i substituted the zucchini for extra sausage. Try the soup with warm multigrain bread dipped into it, mmmmm I'm hooked!

Prepared as described but with more broth (had a 32 oz box, so why waste) and threw in some celery I had in the fridge.  I used cantenelli beans too but otherwise it was a hit with everyone including children  (10,8, and 5)  Served with croastini bread.

This soup is wonderful... I've made it lots of times.  I usually add cheese tortellini and double or triple the beef broth, depending on the amount of tortellini added.  Also good with yellow squash added.  Even better the 2nd day...Great recipe!

AWESOME! My spouse loved and could only ask "Why haven't you made this before?" Served with some pasta cooked seperately and scooped over top to make a little more hearty. Fantastic leftover as well. Will make again...

One of my favorite recipies, esp. in the winter!  I did make a few changes:  added more carrots (I like it sweet), 2 cans of chicken broth in addition to the beef broth, more zuccini, and I've removed all the casing off the saussages before slicing them up.  Canned beans I've tried are kidney (adds more color) & garbonzo  --  depending on what I have on hand.  Instead of spinich I've also used collard greens.  I've made a meat-free version of this using veg. broth & vegetarian Italian saussage.  I add 1-2 TBS of Italian seasoning in the beginning, and as for the "saussage", I brown, set it aside and added it back to the pot during the last 15 min. of cooking  to reheat (prevents the "saussage" from breaking down.  This recipe seems bullet-proof -- it's always turned out great, even when I simmered it for  an hour.  I've served this at dinner parties and most end up having seconds; finicky kids seem to like it too!

Wow, very easy to make and it's kid-approved! All I had to do was to pick out the tomatoes for her that's all. She likes adding rice to her soup as well for a heartier meal.

This was so good. I added onions while browning the sausage. I also added about 1/2 can of rotel for a little kick and probably doubled the spinach. It was amazing.

this recipe has potential, however when you make it exactly like the recipe says it is so oily it upset my stomach.  You have to cook the sausages before hand on a foreman or grill and get some of that fat out.

O.M.Y.! (Oh my YUM!) Tips: I got a good crispy brown on the crumbled sausage. It was very lean, so I shook a little bread crumb & grated parm into the pan to absorb the rest of the fat and dimension to the soup. I also added some garbanzos as well and topped off the soup w/ shaved parmesan. In the future, I may cut the italian sausage w/ ground beef for a milder punch.

Love this soup! You can play with the veggies that you add a little, which is nice.  My family is not big on tomatoes, but we love zucchini so I add a lot of it to this soup.  Great on a cold night with some crusty homemade bread to dip into the broth.

I leaned it up by using turkey itallian sausage... I didn't have HOT (which i prefer) so I added a little red pepper flakes to give it some spice.  I used canallini beans because that's what i had on hand and added a little Herbes de Provence.  Hubby thought it was the best soup ever.  FAST, EASTY and SUPER TASTY!  ENJOY!!!

Sooo good!  I used half sweet and half spicy sausage.  I also drained the fat before adding other ingredients.  Also I used half beef and half homemade chicken stock, so I had a little chicken in the soup too.  Finally I added about 1/3 c. barley because I'm trying to increase my whole grains.  Absolutely delicious.  Thanks!

We really enjoyed this soup.  Made it as stated with the following changes - used hot italian sausage, used extra garlic, added onion and 1/2c. of pasta shells.  Will continue to tweak this recipe, but it is a good basic recipe.  Thanks, Tracy

This soup is AWESOME!! My hubby and I love this soup and it is now one of our favorites.  The only thing we changed by accident was adding less liquid, which made it thicker and we liked it that way.

Thanks for the great soup recipe.  I did add onions and fresh mushrooms.  I also followed the advice of others to use low sodium broth.  It definatley had plenty of salt.  I made the soup early in the day then cooled it and skimmed the fat off of the top. I drained the sausage after browning but there was still a lot of grease.  I also added a can of black beans instead of the great northern.  The soup was even better the next day. I have tried making this soup with turkey sausage and it was ok but it is definatley better with regular sausage.  The turkey sausage was kind of rubbery.

I found this recipe last winter and loved it.  Have already made it this fall.  I use a mix of spicey and sweet sausage and let it simmer for a couple of hours.  One pkg. of froz. spinach is perfect.  Delicious flavor!  Also, I add a half cup of orzo shortly before serving.  Serve with shredded mozz. and crusty bread....amazing!

Absolutely delicious!  I'm a huge fan of homemade soup, but was getting tired of the same old vegetable, chicken noodle, and potato soups, so I was thrilled to come across this recipe.  I only made a few small changes.  Instead of the great northern beans, I added cubed potatoes (my hubby isn't a huge bean fan), I also added a small chopped onion, and I added half regular Italian sausage, and half spicy Italian sausage.  It was SO amazingly good.  I've added this recipe to my recipe box and will make it for years to come!

Good recipe! I add a scoop of cooked jasmine rice to each bowl, pour in the soup and then a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese before serving. Everyone loves it!

Wow! Perfect flavor marriage in this soup! I was hesitant as it just didnt' sound like it would rock  my world, but ohhhh it DID! I made some small modifications - added an onion in the begining, put some diced red and yellow pepper in - and some parmasan cheese rind for flavor. For the last ten minutes i put 1/2 a cup of small shell pasta as i wanted to have that - and i LOVE what this turned into. I think that if you added NOTHING it would still be perfect as is! Thank you for a recipe i will be making often!

Delicious, simple, hearty, & nutritious recipe! I only had kidney beans so I replaced the white beans. I also added some cooked rotini noodles.  My husband and I both loved it!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

4/6/11:  This is awesome!! I altered it by using chicken broth (1 qt + 1 14.5 can) to add to serving size, a bit of chopped onion, omitted zucchini, added t tsp basil and 2 cloves garlic.  Added 1 cup of medium shell pasta after soup was made and before spinach added.  Can't wait to share this recipe with my family.

I took the recipe and adapted it to what I had on hand. I used chicken broth instead of beef, sweet Italian turkey sausage, 2 large cloves garlic, barley, minced onion, chopped red bell pepper, no zucchini,  beans, or tomatoes. It turned out delicious!

This is definitely a WINNER!  I added the carrots and some celery (since I didn't have squash)  when the sausage was cooking.  I also added some Italian seasoning, a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little kick and some Acini Di Pepe pasta. The family said they thought they were at an Italian restaurant.   There was plenty of left overs too since I doubled the batch!   Thank you!

Great tasting soup! I make it about once a week.  I have substituted chorizo for italian sausage and it turns out great as well with a little more of a kick.  I have also added mushrooms and topped with mozzerella cheese.

Very good coup. I used the turkey italian sausage to reduce the calories and added potatoes to make it a little heartier. If you sprinkle some parmesan on top, it reminds me of the Tuscana soup at Olive Garden.  Yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe that is easy, delicious and healthy. We served it with garlic Parmesan bread and it was wonderful. If your family doesn't like big chunks of tomato get the crushed tomato with basil and add some red wine to the soup. Can't wait to make this again!

My husband is not a soup man, but he loved this! I had to simmer it nearly 2 hours because he was late for dinner, but it still tasted great. It's going into my recipe rotation.

We are having this tonight for supper...it is delicious.  Instead of the spinach (I love spinach, but sometimes the taste is too strong in certain things, in my opinion) so I substitute fresh Kale...it's that really curly stuff you sometimes see on your plate as garnish in a restaurant.  But it is so very good for you, full of vitamins, etc.

I make this recipe a lot.  My youngest daughter will not touch beans, but in this recipe she will scarf them down.  I always double the veggies and add extra beef broth.  I always use lean turkey sausage and never add the salt.  This is a staple in our house.  Thanks for the great recipe :)

AMAZING!! I used an extra clove of garlic, 1/3 lb spicy Italian sausage, 2/3 lb sweet Italian sausage, added an onion, a potato, and about 3/4 cup red wine. I omitted the salt b/c the broth I used had quite a bit of sodium and added some Italian seasoning! This is one of my new favorites!

We love this soup. I leave out the spinach though just because I'm not big on the texture of wilted spinach. It is great exactly as written, but we enjoy it even more after we let it simmer on the stove for a couple hours. It is great for leftovers as well!

Very delicious!  I couldn't find ground Italian sausage in the grocery store, so I used Italian bratwarts and removed the casings.  Turned out great.  I will make this soup again for sure!

Great basic recipe that you can alter based on your taste and what you have on hand.  I agree with the other reviews that you should at least double the garlic and also add a chopped onion - I'm a firm believer that no savory Italian recipe should be without these 2 ingredients!  I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of stewed, since I find them to be more flavorful.  It still tasted a little bland, so added a bit of Italian seasoning and some fresh thyme.  Definitely a keeper...thanks for sharing!

Hearty and wonderful.  easy to make. You could hurry this recipe if you don't have time for all the simmering.  Leftovers heat up great.

Delicious!  I added an onion while browning the meat, and added some cheese tortellini right at the end.  My 18 month old loved it!  Definitely making this again!

Very versatile and tasty!  Used low sodium broth and added more broth/water.  Very easy to throw in a handful of extra veggies, pasta, rice, etc.  We doubled the batch and it was great with a load of crusty bread.  Both older and young liked this soup.  Will make again!

I made this for a Nonna Shower today and all the guests raved over and over about this recipe.     I had forgot to put the spinach in and it still tasted great.   The flavor is excellent!    Highly recommend any and all to try.   Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this soup for the first time tonight, and even tho it didn't take very long, it tasted as is if it had simmered for hours!  I used low sodium broth, and the entire 32 oz. container.  I also added some celery, with lots of the leaves.  I used turkey italian sausage and some fresh basil at the end, along with the fresh baby spinach.  I can see this recipe with a lot of variations in veggies, beans, pasta, etc. in the future.

My whole family loves this! I use the Italian Sausage links and cut them into slices, I also use box of frozen spinach, and I put whole baby carrots instead of the carrots sliced. I also sometimes use cans of chicken broth instead of the beef, but this recipe is DELICIOUS with either the chicken or beef broth.

I made this based on all the great reviews and was dissapointed. I followed the recipie exactly. It was ok. I would make it again because its healthy and for me it was gluten free. My hubby was not impressed.

I added an additional can of beef broth- there would not have been enough liquid without it.  Didn't have fresh spinach on hand- I partially thawed a box of frozen cut spinach out on the counter and just dropped it in and the very end- turned off the heat and left the lid on.  I thought the soup was good- not blow you away good but good- my kids 6 and 9 liked it okay as well no seconds though.

This was really great!  I put more of everything in to make a bigger pot of soup but probably the best thing I did was use frozen Italian Meatballs from Costco.  How easy can you get.  This is a keeper and a good base to use any veggies or Orzo or rice that you have on hand.  You can do anything with this!!!

The first words out of my husbands mouth were "I think this is the best soup I ever ate"!!!  Some changes: Two cloves of garlic and a small chopped onion.  Can of diced tomatoes drained instead of stewed.  One more can of broth.  No salt or pepper.  Potatoes instead of beans.  I left out the zucchini just b/c I didn't have it but next time I will put it in.  I let the soup simmer on low for a few hours.  About 15 minutes before I was going to serve I added the spinach and some small pasta (already cooked).  Served with some Warm Italian Bread!!  Fantastic Soup for a nice fall or winter night!!  I can't wait to make it again

This was an easy, tasty meal.  If you are on a salt restricted diet, you might was to use low sodium broth.  Also, I would be sure to use 1/2 sweet & 1/2 hot sausage

This recipe was wonderful!  I followed the advice of adding more beans. I, also, used Jenny-O sweet Italian turkey sausage. My family loved this soup.  It's a great way to get the kids to eat their vegetables.

Yum! Very easy to make. I left out the salt I felt the other ingredients had enough to cover it so anymore seemed like extra. I wasn't able to find 'Italian style' stewed tomatoes so I added regular stewed tomatoes. I also added 4 tablespoons of low sodium vegetable bouillon with two cups of water. It came out very flavorful and filling. I know I'll be making this again and again.

this is such a great base recipe to use, and modify to your liking or to what you have on hand... because of texture preference, i used butter beans and kale, and used up squash and zucchini from the garden - great recipe, and wonderful flavor combination. loved it.

This soup is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used hot Italian turkey sausage (1/2 lb only), doubled the spinach, and added cubed potatoes. I will definitely make this again.

This soup is EXCELLENT...I have my family requesting I make it.  I did make minor changes...I use a little oil when I brown the sausage and 3 cloves of garlic...I use four cans of beef broth because I add cooked cheese tortellini before serving....I use fresh spinach but I slice the spinach in strips and use about 3 cups...if you want to make Italian sausage soup...this is the one to try...you will not be disappointed...I myself are not a soup lover but I LOVE THIS SOUP!!

Such a delicious soup from such simple ingredients! I used 50% less sodium beef broth and didn't need to add more salt. Used fresh Italian sausage from the butcher and guess what, hardly any grease left in the pot, just the yummy crusty bits! Bush's Northern beans are too mushy; they practically disintegrated from just the 15 minute simmer. I wouldn't use them again.

Great easy, full-flavored soup! I use turkey sausage which I prefer. I add red pepper and a bit of hot sauce as I brown the sausage, garlic and onion. For veggies, I use celery, mushrooms, red and green pepper because they all reheat very well. I used two cans of garbanzo beans instead of great northern beans. I use diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano (Del Monte brand) which adds a more flavor than one would expect. I serve with a salad for a lower-carb, healthy meal...

Do you ever come home tired, starving and wishing that Prince Charming had dinner on the table ? Well keep wishing but in the mean time GO MAKE THIS SOUP! It's sooo good and sooo EZ. I used Jimmy Dean sausage roll and added a small cubed potato. Chill so you can take off the excess fat, then put into 2 cup storage containers and off to the freezer. Need a meal ??? Nuke a container of soup, grab a piece of toast and a glass of milk - you'll be a happy camper in under 10 minutes (no Prince needed!).

I have to say, I was quite skeptical about this recipe.  The ingredients didn't appeal to me and the picture didn't either.  But I thought it was something my husband would like and all the rave reviews had me curious.  Well, I'm soooo glad I tried this - AWESOME!!!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was really hearty and delicious.  We ate half of it as soon as it was finished!  It's only a few days later and I'm already running to the store to buy the ingredients to make this again!  This is a keeper!!!

This is a great soup! I usually double the recipe, and it turns out perfectly. It tastes even better the second day. Cooking it a day ahead is also an advantage for the health conscious, in that you can skim off the top layer of fat. But, this is one of our favorite soups, nothing is really necessary to improve it.

Delicious, hearty soup. Added one chopped onion to sausage and garlic. Also used 24 oz of boiling water, 3 tsp of beef bouillon and 4 oz red wine. Would recommend draining grease from sausage, as I thought the end soup was a little oily. Otherwise, very delicious and a filling meal. Topped with a little crushed red pepper for those who like it spicier.

I made this for my bunco dinner and I got a lot of  great raves!!  I made this with both sweet/hot turkey sausage.  It really had good flavor. 
I added tortellini in the last five mins and it was perfect. I did follow the suggestion about using low sodium beef broth...thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!  Easy and the kids didn't even notice the spinach.  I did add some 4 cheese ravioli too, I think I just needed some sort of noodle.  It added a nice "chew".  I will definately be making this again within the month.

This is hand's down the best soup I've ever had! I've been making another version of this for years with red wine and mushrooms so I put the two together and now it's the perfect soup. I use hot Italian sausage and always double the recipe as it reheats well and I always share! Note: the red wine adds richness and depth to the broth but I simmer it with the meat and garlic and onions before adding the veggies. Worth the time!

This recipe is very forgiving. You can easily add additional vegetables which has already been suggested. One thing I add that takes the soup to a new level is cheese tortellini.  Tonight I'm going to add green beans instead of the zucchini, because that is what I have.  I also like to mix it up with hot and mild sausage and I always use more broth.

You say to use the juice in the can of beans.  My advice:  taste the juice in any canned veggies/beans one time and you'll never use it again.  It's nasty.  Always, always dump veggies/beans, etc., into a collander and rinse well with cold water.

Great and quick to make when you're pressed for time. I used 2 links hot  and 4 links sweet sausage(remove from casing) and it had just the right kick! I would also suggest omitting or cutting the salt in half.

This was the first soup of my year of weekly soups.  The soup was by far the best soup I have ever made.  I added some extra veggies to help add some nutritional value.  My TOP suggestion would be drain the sausage if cooked on a stove top.  My soup was kind of greasy because I did not drain, however the flavor was too good, so I overlooked that small fact.  I look to alter this recipe in the future with other veggies.  Very good.

Excellent!  My family loved this soup.  Really easy to make.  Fresh spinach is best, added at the end as suggested.  I added a few sliced red potatoes for extra heartiness.  I used ground italian sausage which had a nicer texture than the skinned sausage and also gave me a nice sausage flavor in every bite. I also used a lower sodium swanson's beef broth in the carton rather than the concentrated salty broth in the cans.  The great thing about this soup, is that you can make alot of substitutions and still have a nice and hearty soup.  It also made my house smell so good as I was preparing it.

i didnt add the beans, but the sausgae made the soup very salty. next time ill add less sausage and definitely more spinach - it tastes GREAT with the soup and a very good, painless way to get more veggies into your body. and this is a great soup for cold nights -very comforting

Had to make a few substitutions because I didn't have everything on hand.  Used chicken broth in place of beef broth.  Used one can chopped tomatoes and added Italian seasoning.  Used light kidney beans (drained because I always drain that thick stuff off canned beans). We all loved it.

This soup is so flavorful and declicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe states and everyone loved it.  Even people who do not like zucchini or spinach reluctantly tried it & then went back for more!  I will definitely make this again.

This is fantastic, easy and delicious!  I left out the spinach, but added more zucchini and added half an onion, browned with already cooked turkey italian sausage.  If you use turkey sausage, brown in olive oil, and hold off on adding garlic until later - otherwise it burns!  Also added some orzo in the last step to bulk it up a bit!  My new favorite!!

I really enjoyed this soup. I added a cup of celery and used three cans of low sodium beef broth. I will definitely make it again! Like all soups, it was even better the next day.

This soup is great!  My husband isn't a fan of squash, but he didn't mind the zucchini one bit.  We will be making this again for sure.

I made this yesterday and its all gone today! Very good and not difficult to make at all, just chopping the veggies. I live in Germany so I can not buy Italian sausage so I used Gehacktes which is raw ground pork meat, very lean and has lots of garlic in it where I purchase it from. I hate when people modify a recipe and then rate it but I have no choice as I can not always get the ingredients. I opted against adding fennel to the Gehacktes as my husband hates it. I also added green and red peppers which needed to be used, and some celery stalks as they had to be used as well and which also made up for the lacking fennel. I did not use any salt and the soup was a dream. My husband raved about it all evening. Thanks for sharing this recipe will be making it again and again. Its also difficult to find such large quantites of Beef Broth over here so I used from Rewe Gemüsefond mit Verjus. Can never go wrong with that great broth. This soup is so hearty you don't even need bread or a salad to compliment it

This soup WON my church's cooking competition hands down!  I probably added more sausage than called for, and chose a spicy hot italian sausage for extra zip.  I used yellow summer squash instead of green zucchini which added great color.  This one was a hit!

My husband couldn't get enough of this soup!  Wonderful flavor, I used 1/2lb hot italain sausage and 1/2lb turkey burger.  Was perfect.  I also added mushrooms, just because I love mushrooms, and added spinach cheese tortellini.  Will have this regularly during the winter months

We really liked this.  Made as written, with the addition of an onion and 2 more cups of broth.  Man said he would eat again, which surprised me given the recipe is veggie-heavy.  Grated Parmesan on top is a must!

This is a phenomenal, hearty winter soup that had my kids asking for seconds and thirds. I made a double batch, hoping for leftovers but the pot was empty when we cleared the table.  I recommend hot Italian Sausage links for a little kick - or for a double batch, use half hot, half mild.

I made this for dinner tonight, DELICIOUS! I was skeptical if the broth would be rich tasting, but the sausage made it very tasty and hearty. We served it with cresent rolls which were delicious dipped in the juice. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and I will definitely make it again!

This soup was unbelieveable! Was dark and cold outside so ran to the store for the easy ingredients to make this.  It has so much flavor! Ate it with cornbread muffins as suggested- delicious! My seven year old asked for seconds!! Very good with a glass of red wine too

This soup is delicious!  The rating is true.  My changes:  I added sliced kielbasa in place of the spinach (this was in addition to the Italian sausage) and used the "Better Than Bouillon Beef" (in a jar) using the same ounces in water as the canned beef broth - instead of the beef broth.   Really good.  I made it for a class at my church and everyone loved it!

It's a user error kinda review so I wouldn't put too much impact on it. I added too many lentils and so there wasn't much broth. I like it more soupy and less stew like. I also added some sweet Italian sausage. My husband devoured it and it makes A TON of food so be prepared to freeze whatever you can't finish!

This is so good! Even the kids love it. I like to cook the sausage, and then throw everything in the crockpot. I used 4 fresh large tomatoes instead of canned because we have them from the garden. I added the zucchini about mid-day. I added some leftover brown rice too for extra fill and fiber. If you add cooked rice, only add it about an hour or two before you eat, or it may soak up too much juice. I may add Quinoa next time.  This is a good base all on it's own.

Hands down best soup ever! I made this for dinner and everyone couldnt stop with the Mmmm mmmm mmmmm's. Made it for my parents and they said very emphatically it was the best homemade soup they ever had. I added some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch and used ground sausage, just crumbled it into big chunks.

It's a winner! Absolutely tasty. I like a bit of stronger fennel flavor with the Italian saugsage so I added a tsp of ground fennel and a dash of Tabasco for the mild spicy kick. My husband who is a picky eater gave it 5 stars.

oh WOW! This is SO GOOD! I was looking for recipes using sausage since a friend gave me a bunch of pork from her farm. I am so glad I found this one. I will make it again and again. Don't add salt until the end, after you have tasted the final product.

Excellent, easy recipe.  Adding 1/2 a diced green pepper, 2 stalks chopped celery and a whole onion chopped while browning the sausage helped to add depth to the soup. I also added more stock(vegetable, cause I had it) as per other reviewers.  Thanks for a real keeper!

Fabulous. It's a keeper! Per other suggestions I added some onion to the sausage and garlic and a little additional beef broth and stewed tomatoes.  Thanks!

This is absolutely one of the best soups I have every tasted... fantastic! Although I did add another can of broth, otherwise it is all chunk and no liquid. Excellent!

I had my doubts that any soup that was this quick and easy could possibly be as good as this soup was rated. those doubts were gone after the first taste of this wonderful soup. I thought I was at the Olive Garden. This is hands down the best soup I have ever made.

Simple yet tasty soup.  Real easy to prepare.  I made exactly as written and the only thing i found was that my zucchini went mushy.  Will be making again but will just keep a closer eye on the zucchini.  thanks for the recipe!

For as quick as is was to make, this was excellent soup.  Everyone liked it, and it had spinach for goodness sake.  Always 5 stars when it's good, and the fam eats the vegetables!

This was easy to make.  I used left over spaghetti sauce since I didn't have any tomatoes on hand.  I used celery instead of zucchini because that's what I had.  My husband was amazed that there wasn't any seasoning in it.  This was super easy to make.  I liked the white beans.

This is an awesome recipe! Thx 'SALLYJUN' for sharing. Great base soup that is exceedingly easy to adjust according to your taste. I decided to add 2 packages Italian sausage 1 sweet & 1 hot, like many other review's suggested, the flavors balance each other out. I also added red potatoes sliced paper thin, using a pampered chef tool, and left the skin on.  And, Lastly, because I don't really care for spinach in soup I subbed kale, which worked perfectly.  All the flavors meld beautifully together, definitely a keeper.

Excellent soup.  DH forgot to add the carrots, but it was fine without.  Next time I may pre-cook some tortellini or orzo and add it to the pot for a variation, but it was quite good as it was.

I received this recipe from a friend about a year ago and have made it many times.  My 5 year old helps me chop the veggies all the ingredients together.  She loves to eat the soup because she helps make it.  I usually use turkey sausage.  And I just buy the bagged spinach in the salad section.  I don't even tear or chop it.  I just dump it in!  We sprinkle parmesean cheese on top before serving.  YUMM!

SOOO tasty! My husband (Mr. Don't Try Anything New) said this is a keeper--make it again. I served this last week for company and got a rave review from all. Changes: no spinach, more garlic (always!), onions, crushed red pepper (spiced it up!), small shell pasta at the end, extra zucchini & carrots. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage and added an additional can of chicken broth (1-1/2 recipe) and served it with garlic/cheese bread. This is one of the most flavorful soups I've ever had. We ate it again last night as left-overs and I think it might have even been better than the first time! Thanks for the recipe AND the suggestions :-)

this makes great leftovers. make sure you drain the sausage before adding the other ingredients. Also, quarter the zucchini and carrots to reduce simmering time.

When I make this soup, I use several different flavors of turkey sausage and instead of cooking the spinach in the soup, I line the bottom of the soup bowl with it and pour the hot soup over to cook it slightly - great flavor and texture.

I made this according to the recipe, and it was excellent.  The only problem is that there wasn't enough of it!  Now I double it so there's some left over.  We live in Florida, and I would be willing to make it all year!

Like others, I added a few things (potato, ditalini pasta) and needed more broth due to the addition of the pasta, but this was wonderful!  I've made it twice and even my 10 year-old son likes it.  It doesn't sound that great when you just name the ingredients, but it is perfectly satisfying.

I made this hearty soup over the weekend and the prep time was so quick and easy!  To cut prep time, I bought pre-sliced carrot chips and pre-cut and washed spinach.  I also added a can of water and one beef boullion cube in addition to the two cans of low-sodium beef broth because I felt that it was so loaded with veggies/meat that it needed more liquid.  I used a hot sausage mix from the butcher and it really gave the soup great flavor.  In all, this took me 30 minutes total...painless even for a weeknight dinner!  And full of flavor.  5 stars!

I made this for a soup contest last week.  I used half hot Italian sausage browned with onions, celery and garlic.  I did not put in any spinach, but added ditalini pasta instead.  I also did not add salt and used low sodium broth.  Needless, to say the soup was great.  I won first place over 30 other contestants.

I really enjoyed this.  I have a lot of picky people in my family so I did as others suggested and substitued diced yukon gold potatoes and fresh green beans for the zucchini and carrots (added them both when carrots should have been added and were cooked perfectly).  My sister said she would have prefereds firmer beans (like kidney beans) to the great northern, which are a bit soft.

I made this twice within a month.  First, for a football get together -- my guests LOVED it.  Second, for Thanksgiving weekend.  I made the soup Monday without spinach, refrigerated it for travel, and served it (heated w/o spinach) Saturday night with a great freshly baked crusty bread.  The only reason I left out the spinach the second time was ease.  The soup tastes great both ways.

Great recipe.  I added chopped celery and onions and omitted the spinach and zucchini.  Diced tomatoes replaced stewed, as I don't like the bigger chunks.    Definitely a keeper!!!

Yummy...My boyfriend was skeptical and said he would just make a sandwich...After it started to cook, it smelled wonderful... He gave in and ate 3 bowls! I used canned carrots and frozen spinach for a quick mix.  BRAVO!

Really really good! Makes an excellent lunch if you freeze it in individual portions.

I subsituted Black Beans for the Great Northern Beans (what I had on hand), and used a larger can of stewed tomatoes than was called for, as I love chunky tomatoes in soup.

All in all, a great recipe I will definately make again.

This soup was great. Chunky and hearty - just perfect for autumn. I used ground italian sausage (1/2 hot, 1/2 sweet) and frozen chopped spinach (since the grocer didn't have any fresh). It still turned out great.

This is a wonderful "busy day" recipe - full of flavor, quick and easy to prepare. After reading other reviews I too added onions to the garlic and sausage (casings removed and cut in bite sized pieces).  Used two cans 19 oz ea white kidney beans (undrained) and added a good tsp or so of Italian Spice Mix.  Served with parm cheese on top and a 'good earth' baguette warmed in the oven.  DH made sure I added this recipe to our 'family favorites' - thanks for sharing..

I have made this soup many times since I found this recipe about a year ago.  It is wonderful. I find myself stocking up on the ingredients when I'm grocery shopping.  Oh course, I change things a bit.  Don't keep canned bullion so I use beef bullion cubes instead.  Also cut the carrots down to one carrot to lower the carb count.  I also use half yellow squash and half zucchini for added color.  Have discovered that it works just as well with frozen squash.  It doesn't matter if the sausage is hot or mild--whatever is available.  I don't bother with salt & pepper, however.  It is plenty spicy.  Thanks for a great meal!

This is my second recipe to try from this website. I really liked this soup. My husband said it was the best soup he had ever had. I added onions while browning the sausage. I also added small noodles like suggested.

I have a similar recipe using regular breakfast sausage that I liked more. This one was very bland. I referred to my other recipe and added potatoes and basil. Left out the spinach and zucchini.

I took the casing off my sausage and fried it crumbled. Added extra garlic,1/2 green pepper and 1/2 red pepper. Didn't have zucchini. By the time I added all the extras, I needed to add another can of broth(used 3 total) and also added an 8 oz. can tomato sauce. Added 1/2 tsp. oregano and a package of frozen spinach. Everything else used as  stated. The broth was so good, but next time I will leave out the spinach, kids and hubby didn't like that part. Hamburger would be good in this too. Thanks!

I would give this recipe 3-1/2 stars the first day, and 4-1/2 stars the second day.  Definitely tastes better the second day.  I used 1-1/2 lbs. of Italian link sausage, cut into small rounds, and as recommended by previous reviewers, used 1 zucchini and 1 cup of cooked pasta.  I used low-sodium broth and cut out the salt altogether as there is plenty in the canned ingredients added.  A great fall soup.

I usually will let a dish with tomato age for a day before eating. This works especially well for this recipe for a couple of reasons; once cold the fat hardens and stays on top making it very easy to remove to create a lower fat content. Second the aging allows the flavors to blend together nicely. I did add the zucchini and spinach just before serving the following day.     
A very nice recipe, if you look for 'keepers' this will be one.

Ok people, the recipe as-is is excellent.  Don't change everything then say "it was great."  When you change everything it becomes a different recipe.  Just saying.  I also love onions, and potatoes, but didn't add them to this - and let me say, it was really, really, good.  I used spicy Italian sausage, which is exactly right if you like that little kick.  I didn't have straight up spinach, but a mix of baby greens including spinach, so that was a change and I'm sure I would love it even more with only spinach. Regarding the zucchini so many people eliminate - don't! Chopped small and cooked til tender, you can't taste it by itself, but it definitely adds exactly what it is supposed to, and you don't cheat yourself out of  getting your needed veggie serves for the day.  So try it the way it is presented before adding onions etc, it will be an entirely different taste, I promise you. And you will love it.  Then make your new recipe with modifications so you know the difference.  This was a sweet winter surprise I will be making every winter.  And sometimes I will modify it for variation, but not sure if it will actually be an improvement or not. This recipe is very excellent.

Oh my gosh!  This was delicious!  Made the recipe exactly as written except that I added one cup of cooked noodles at the end and I used low sodium broth which I will definitely do next time.  Next time I'll change the beans ... maybe cannellini ??....... as the great northern beans got mushy. Nevertheless this soup had the BEST flavor and the proportions were dead on (don't be afraid that it won't be soupy enough ... 2 cans of broth ended up to be perfect).  Vote BEST SOUP in my house which says a lot since I make some really good soups!!!   EDIT.  Tried cannellini beans, still were mushy.  I didn't like the taste.  I will try again with the called for beans, adding the last 5 minutes or so.

Made this with what I had in my pantry and fridge: browned sausage (turkey Italian) in EVOO, added red pepper flakes and minced garlic, added chicken broth and diced tomatoes, and finished with white beans and a frozen square of spinach. SOOO good!!

This was awesome!  The only change I made was that I eliminated the zucchini (personal preference).  Other than that, made exactly as directed and it was great!  I have even made it by browning the sausage on the stove, then dumping the rest of the ingredients into the crock pot and cooking on low all day... still turned out great.  Thanks for a great go-to recipe!

YUM! This recipe just screams out for CHOPPED CELERY and ONION sauteed gently in a 50/50 mix of a small amount of olive oil and butter, and THEN pour the oil into the soup. I used chick peas instead of the mentioned beans, and fresh chopped spinach. Make enough for leftovers!

BEST recipe on the site.  Delicious, nutritious, and a real pleaser with everyone. I've made it as the recipe reads and I've added my own and added or subtracted whatever I had on hand.  GREAT recipe without changes-- individual tastes vary and this recipe allows for changes without losing it's basic character! Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This was very good and easy to prepare.  Followed recipe but did use lower sodium beef broth and stewed tomatoes and eliminated the salt completely.  The salt content o n the original recipe is much too high for me.  However, this was great without all the added salt.

Very good.  I didn't have Italian tomatoes, so I used regular stewed and added about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  I diced the zucchini very small to make them less distinguishable to the kids... it worked!  The kids liked it.

Made this for the first time today and just finished a bowl.  It was delicious.  I used a 20 oz package of hot turkey italian sausage. I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers.  I used 2 cans of low sodium beef broth and 2 cups of salt free free chicen broth.  I added a can of kidney beans in addition to the great norther bean.  I also added about of cup of elbow macaroni during the last 9 minutes. I added zucchini and celery. Finally, I added a bag of frozen spinash.  My first reactiion was that the soup was a bit sweet and lacked salt.  I added some salt which tamed the sweetness. To reduce the sweetness in the future I think I'll use plain diced tomatoes and add italian seasons.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow because I think this is a soup that is even better left over.  A great soup that I will make often!

This soup is wonderful!  Perfect for a cold winter evening.  I use ground sausage (hot Italian) as that is what is available in my location.  I have made this using zucchini and I have also substituted the zucchini with yellow squash and both are excellent.   I like to use baby spinach and I also sometimes add small pasta (ditalini, acini de pepe).

Ok, I like to read the reviews before I do any new recipe, but with this one I was disappointed with how may people changed it totally. So what are you really rating, This recipe or your own.  I am usually a good judge of what looks good when I see it so I made this just as the recipe says.  It was awesome!!! Wouldn't change a thing!!!!

excellent soup....little effort truly for a great tasting fresh and healthy meal.  I did use the low sodium beef broth and did use an extra can as suggested, also the onions and garlic in the beginning sauteed with the sausage....also added oregano and basil and a dash of tabasco and sugar....thank you for sharing this most delicious recipe...wonderful addition to our kitchen :)

LOVE this recipe!  I make it in the crock pot, precooking the sausage first. I serve over prepared tortellini, placing fresh spinach on top of pasta then spooning soup over spinach just to wilt from the heat of the soup.  Fresh grated parmesan finishes the dish perfectly!

Wicked good soup! And inexpensive to make ;) I too decided to changed it up a bit, but by mostly adding the following: red pepper flakes, chicken tender medallions, chopped celery, and chopped onions. Came out great that way, but honestly the foundation of this soup is key - good italian sausage, garlic, tomatoes, beans, with some good broth all make a great dish - Cheers!

Made this to use up zucchini, chopped frozen spinach and some hot turkey sausage.  I cooked the links, then diced and browned them while chopping the rest of the veggies.  I only had chopped frozen spinach, so I nuked it for 3 minutes and added it and a tsp of italian seasoning with the zucchini.  After simmering it for 20 minutes or so, it was so good!  An easy flavorful keeper.

This soup is amazing! I seldom cook with sausage and I have never made a sausage soup. It sounded a bit weird but had so many great reviews I risked it and doubled the recipe for a casual dinner for 12. I added 2 cans of kidney beans, 2 kinds of squash for color, used about 50% more sausage, half hot half mild, no added salt, low sodium broth and one chopped onion, a lot more pepper and a TBSP of Italian seasoning. I forgot to add the red wine someone suggested and next time will do that. On the side I offered cooked mini pasta and diced cooked potatoes for those who like their soup a bit heartier. If we weren't cutting out 'white food' I would have added one or the other to the soup. It was amazing and completely gone. Everyone loved it and I will be careful to make enough for leftovers next time. For this recipe, as quickly as it cooks, I think using a mandolin for the veggies gives you a much more evenly cooked result, especially for the squash and the carrots. Thank you SallyJun for a terrific recipe.

wow wonderful flavour. followed the recipe exect. would not change a thing. I did use hot italian sausage and boy did that take the soup on a whole new level! *** I would like to add to my original review. This soup really is FANTASTIC! It is the perfect fall/winter soup for those cold damp days when the fire is lit. (well if you live in southern Ontario that is). I once made this when we were snowed in, all the neighbors came over on their ATV’s and after plowing us out had a bowl. Which they raved about …come to think of it the Cognac may also have helped … It freezes well and if you like spice use a hot sausage, other than that don’t change a thing. Thanks for the great winter warm up! ***

At the first hint of Fall, I start thinking about a big pot of soup simmering away.  Last week I stumbled on this and the gang was wildly pleased.  I did add about 1/2 pound of orzo (way too much) to give the soup a little more body, some Italian seasoning with a teaspoon or so of Rosemary.

They are asking for it again soon!  Great recipe.

Wish I could give it 4.5 stars -- 4 seems too few, and 5 too many.  Though I think it could be tweaked to a 5-star level easily.

I made it exactly as written.  The recipe doesn't specify anything about the sausage, so I used Whole Foods spicy Italian sausage.  I think when I make it again, I might try a blend -- half spicy, half mild -- because it seemed to me that the spicy flavor dominated a little more than would be ideal.  That change alone would likely bump this to 5 stars.  

One other thing -- and it, too, might be a function of the specific sausage I used:  it seemed to me to be a tiny bit greasy when first I served it.  The next day I took the leftovers out and skimmed the excess fat off the top, and when I heated up the leftovers, that was no longer an issue.  Also, the flavors had mellowed a little the second day -- it seemed altogether better on day 2.

Very good!! As like other reviewers, this was not a soup that jumped out at me at first...made it after reading several comments. Surprised at the flavor. I used 1/2 sweet and 1/2 hot sausage, didn't add zucchini, not a fan. Did add about 3/4 cup small shell pasta. This recipe is a definate keeper!!

I used this recipie as a starting point but added alot to it to make it 5 star. I added a chopped onion, used homemade chicken stock, and dry beans that I cooked prior to making the soup.  Flavored with fresh sage, oregano and rosemary Also added cheese tortellini at the end.  Turned out amazing!!

This recipe has become a family favorite and is requested frequently! I use kidney beans instead of the northern, and I like to use turkey sausage to save on fat and calories.  Turns out great everytime, and it is so easy to make!

Great soup!  I did make a couple of changes as I read other reviewers.  I sauted 1/2 onion until soft and then I added the garlic and 'Turkey' sausage until brown.  The rest remained the same, except for adding 1/2 tablespoon of Italian seasoning and topped it off with parmesan cheese.  My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  Thank you!

I used low sodium broth and left out the extra 1/4 teaspoon of salt. It was delicious! I think I'll use dried beans and try making my own sausage next time to bring the sodium content down even more. Thanks for the recipe!

I made some significant changes, so I can't comment too much, but it's a great base to work with.  I made it vegetarian by using veggie broth and veggie italian sausages.  It was great.  I also added a can of green beans, a can of tomato sauce, extra broth and some additional italian seasoning.  Thanks for sharing!

This soup is so good. I add an extra can of broth & use frozen sliced carrots instead of fresh ones.

I just prepared this for dinner tonight.  I added some meat tortellini and shredded the carrots.  It is wonderful.  It is very easy.  Next time I will probably add another can of beans.  Thanks for a great recipe.  My kids are soup lovers.  It is a family hit.  I will definately make it again.

This soup was amazing.  Like other reviewers, this isn't something I would normally make, but it will now be a staple. Instead of using beef broth I used left over pan drippings and juice from a prime rib roast I had made.  Unbelievable.  My hubby declared it the best soup he had ever had.  It was that good.

GREAT RECIPE!  I have made this a couple times now and love it.  I followed suggestions from other reviews and made the following changes: used hot italian sausage, 3 cloves of garlic, added 1 can of chicken broth, 1 small onion diced, 2 celery stalks diced, 1 can white kidney beans (drained and pureed), 1/2 cup uncooked orzo pasta and 1 tea crushed red pepper.  Brown sausage, celery, garlic and onion in dutch oven.  Add broth, tomatoes, carrots, crushed red pepper and pepper and simmer 1 hour uncovered.  Add pureed kidney beans and cook another half-hour.  Add zucchini and can of great northern beans and cook 15 minutes.  Add orzo and cook 5 min.  Add spinach and cook another 5 min.  Add extra water if too thick. Serve with shredded romano cheese on top.  The most important change is the addition of the orzo pasta.  It really made the soup delicious and filling.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this last night and while it was indeed a good soup (love the spinach in it) I just felt that it was missing *something.* My husband agreed. Not sure what though. I will be making it again and playing with the recipe to see if I can make it suit our tastes better.

At other reviewers suggestion, I used hot italian sausage, 2 boxes of frozen spinach and orzo pasta.  My husband (a pickey eater) said this is the best soup he's ever eaten!

Like this needed another 5 star review, but I'm going to give it one anyways! This was surprisingly delicious and easy with such simple ingredients. I added some canned black beans that I had left over from another meal and it added a great colour. This will go in the regular soup rotation.

This was great.  I used turkey sausage instead to cut down the fat, and it was delicous.

This was delicious and so fast and easy to make! I got 4 fresh sausages from the butcher - 2 honey garlic, 2 hot (or whatever your fav is) and used a veggie broth.  I always take the meat out of  the casing (light slice down the center and rip the case off) chop into approx bite size pieces to brown.  I will add more broth next time as the next day when I reheated leftovers I found I wanted more juice for dipping!  I ate the soup with fresh french baguette mmmm.  I brought some to my parents and they loved it so much they went out and bought the ingredients to make it the next day! I'm here updating to say I add more than 4 sausages, more like 6...my guy loves the meat the most (surprise surprise)  Thanks you so much...healthy and amazing!

EXCELLENT! This is my most favorite soup...to eat and make.  The only changes I made were to add 3 cloves of garlic instead of one, 6 cups of beef broth instead of two cans, two cans of great northern beans instead, I leave out the spinach, and I add 3/4 cup of orzo.  I don't add any salt at all because this recipe does not need it.  All my company I have served it to loves it and it is the favorite soup in this house for my husband and me.

Our favorite sausage soup!  I used hot italian for my sausage.  To reduce sodium, I used store brand broth (surprisingly much lower sodium than Swanson's low-sodium)& eliminated the 1/2 teaspoon called for.  Thanks for a great winter warmer!

Like everyone says- this is excellent! Judging by the name, I wouldn't have thought this to be so good! I did use 2# of italian sausage instead of 1, and it was perfect. I used half frozen spinach, half fresh spinach. My boyfriend added rice to his, and next time I may add corn. I will definetly make this again soon!

What a versatile recipe ! I used HOT sausage and added 1 tlb Italian seasoning as previously recommended and then everything I had in the kitchen. Extra zucchini (cause we had a ton), left over rice, a couple of stalks of celery and doubled the broth. It smelled fantastic and was extremely flavorful. Loved it!!

Loved it!!! It was too spicy for my 3 year old son, but hubby & I really enjoyed it! Next time I may use half hot sausages & half sweet sausages for the kiddo... Or just make a bowl of mac n' cheese for him!

Loved it.  My husband said it was the best soup he ever had.  I used a spicy sausage that I sliced.  I made it the night before I was going to eat it so once I removed the soup from the heat I let it cool for a little bit and then added the spinach.  I was worried that when I reheated it the spinach would be overcooked but it was PERFECT!!!  Highly recommend this recipe.

This soup is awesome!  I made it exactly as it is and my 10 yr. old son even liked it.  (I don't think he's ever even had cooked spinach before!)I did add another can of broth in before I put away the leftovers. It made a lot.  I will definately make this again!

Sorry I didn't think this was that good. I made some changes & I now don't rate anything high that needed changes. I used a can of green beans instead of tomatoes, cabbage instead of spinache & added 1 chopped onion, 1 C. ditalini pasta & 1 extra can of beef broth. It tasted ok the day I made it, the sausage gives it all the flavor. The next day, the beans, zucchini & green beans were mushy. If you make this leave out the zucchini, you won't miss it. My husband said this had too much of a vegetable taste, not that he doesn't like vegetables but as in there were just too many. Sorry.

OUTSTANDING SOUP!  YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE THIS A TRY.  Tastes like it took you all day & yet it's ready in 30 mins.  We served this at a party of 50 people recently & it was such a hit.  I've made it 3 times since.  The flavors are wonderful together & the vegetables really make it very refreshing.  It's not a heavy soup like you would think.  I added small pasta (ditalini) during the last 10 mins or so (before the spinach) & it was a great addition.  Don't pass this one by!  It's a keeper.

Very good flavor!  Suggestion...don't add all of the zucchini, pasta or spinach to the original batch.  If you have leftovers they will be very mushy when reheated.  Add only enough per meal so that they are firm each time.

This soup was so good! My husband really enjoyed it too and he ate the leftovers for days! I used the spicy Italian sausage and added 9 oz of fresh tortellini at the same time I added the zucchini. What a great way to get all my vegetables incorporated in to my meal. I also used the prepackaged spinach leaves which made for a quick, easy, tasty meal. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  I used kale instead of spinach (kale was much cheaper), and okra instead of zucchini (okra was 1/3 the cost of zucchini).  We loved this and definitely will be included in our menu rotation during the cold weather months.

This was great, i had to ad lib a few things sicne i did not have them, i did not use beans ( i don't like them) and had no zuchinni, but added fresh green beans,and added corn onions, green adn red peppers. it was great took it to a pot luck at a friends house and they loved it. i have been on a soup kick lately and this hit the spot. thank you can't wait to bring it to work!! (if there are any leftovers) my kids loved it too but picked out what they did not like (peppers and onions) great with crusty bread and a little parm cheese on top.

This was really great and I love a recipe that I can freeze and reheat without losing its flavor!  My husband really liked it as well, it's a good combination of meat, veggies, and spice.

Delicious. I doubled the recipe. I pretty much made it exactley. I realized when I started I had bought regular pork sausage so I added a few shakes of italian season while it was browning, added the garlic when it was almost done browning. I used water/beef boullion instead of broth. Ground up the tomatoes a little bit in a food processor. Did not add the salt was perfect without it.

This is a wonderful soup.  Easy to prepare and great flavor too.  Just like a Minestrone with sausage.  Next time I make it I will add some orzo.

Easy and great tasting! I added 2 xtra cups of beef broth, bag of cheese tortellini, tablesppon of Italian seasoning and extra carrots. I would decrease the amount of spinach next time. I don't think I will put the zuchini in next time either. You can play with this recipe alot. My hubby loved it.

This soup is fabulous - my husband and I loved it.  I used bratwurst and turkey sausage, also more spinach than called for.  Will make this many more times.  Update:  I use lean tomato/basil/chicken sausage.  After sausage is browned I put about 3 tbs. of butter in pot and brown an 8-oz. pkg. of sliced baby bella mushrooms, then continue the recipe as written - absolutely DELISH!

As with all soups you can add/omit veggies and spices according to taste.  I always add a couple of tablespoons of fennel seed for a more "Italian" taste and use V8 or tomato juice as the base.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I changed it a bit by preparing it in the crockpot. I added everything in at the start but the spinach. I added the spinach about 20-30 min before serving.

I am not a cook.  When I invited 10 friends over for a light bohemian style supper I rushed to All Recipes and decided on this soup.  It was a HUGE hit!  Very very delicious with Crusty Italian Breads!  I also served the Roquefort Pear Salad which scored high with my guests as well!

I made this deeeeeeelicious recipe 100% according to directions on every ingred, EXCEPT I used low sodium beef broth for half the required amount. It's really deeeelicious,and it will be on my table for years to come. I revved it up with a little garlic and a hand full of fresh Cilantro.  Not much to change. Why mess with perfection?

Tasty, easy, healthy. A little on the greasy side, but rinsing the sausage would have reduced that significantly. The whole family ate it and it was reasonably low in carbohydrates. Thanks for posting!

This is so much better the next day. Upon initial review, I said I wouldn't make it again. Today, I have changed my mind greatly. The flavors had a chance to meld together and it is terrific.....Especially with some shredded parmesan on top.

I thought this soup was very tasty.  Those on a sodium-reduced diet shouldn't try this one though,....rinse off the beans and limit the salt!  I will definitely make this again and again.  Very easy and good with shredded cheddar cheese on top.

WOW! The flavour in this stew is amazing! I substituted 1 leek for the zucchini, used 3 hot Italian sausages to spice it up a bit and used 2 Bovril beef bouillon packets plus 2 cups of water instead of the broth. Will definately be making this again!

Awesome soup!  Lots of flavor.  Even better the next day.  May be the best soup I have ever made.
Thanks for the recipe!

Superb!  couldn't have been any better.  Scaled for 50 so I could use it for two days but there wasn't any leftover.  I double the sausage but only because my customers like a really meaty soup.....this is definitely one for the file box!

My Mom was the original  poster, Sallyjun. This is one of our favorite recipes of her many creations. We lost her last Christmas and finding the video and how many people have enjoyed it makes it feel like she is still here sharing her amazing food and joy for cooking with the world. Thank you for reminding me how lucky we were to have her making our dinner Each night.

This is without a doubt the best soup I have ever made... potentially eaten. I agree with other reviewers- low sodium broth is a necessity.  I  omitted the salt and sprinkled the top with grated Parmesan and it was perfect. Will make again very soon.

I saved this recipe 2 years ago and finally made it last night.  OMG, why did it take me so long!   Awesomely delicious!  I did use a little diced onion, increased garlic, used half hot Italian and half chicken Italian and topped it with a little grated Parmesan.  I also added another can of beans to make it super substantial.  I can see using garbanzos in the future.  The combined ingredients provided plenty of salt so I did not need to add any more.  My husband is a gourmet cook, and he said this is a "keeper", which is high praise from him indeed!
1/8/20 UPDATE..For non red meat eaters, make this using chicken/turkey Italians and chicken broth.   The result is equally delicious!  I triple the  garlic and add onion to the saute also. I prefer using Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes , NOT stewed.   Love this soup!

I love this recipe! There were a few things I changed though. Being Italian, I did not use spinach b/c it shreds into tiny pieces, instead, we use escarole. It won't shred-up. I also added celery and diced onion. Italian dishes really do cook a lot with celery, it adds good flavor. It was ok. I'm not a big fan of sausage. I probably won't make this again. Not that happy with it.

Added cooked pasta per other review recommendations. Otherwise stayed true to the recipe. Loved it! Great the next day too. Remember to drain off fat from sausage before adding other ingredients. Bread is a definite plus for sopping up the liquid.

absolutely wonderful and super easy.  DH loves spicy so I did use "hot" italian sausage and a couple of left over andouille sausages.  Used extra broth also.  Wonderful feel/texture to this soup.  Thank you for sharing.

Amazing!  Especially with fresh sausage from the butcher.  I also cubed a couple yukon gold potatoes to add into the recipe.  Yum!  
One alteration I enjoyed immsensely was using Kale instead of spinach the second time I made this....the kale added a bit more texture.  I added it with the carrots in the first step, as kale can take a little while to soften a bit.

Great recipe! Had to make a few substitutions based on what I had on hand. Used butter beans, added 2 squash cubed instead of zucchini, added about 1/3 cup of elbow noodles, a potato peeled and cubed and an extra can of diced Italian tomatoes and finally I only had 2 cans of broth so I added beef bullion granules and 2 cans of water to add enough liquid for all the starches. Did not add salt because of bullion. Super simple and delicious and a good use of veggies!! Loved it and will make again! Thanks!

Very,very good. Like some others I added chopped onion to the sausage and garlic as it was browning. Also as others commented this recipe is easy to change up using what's on hand and it still comes out delicious. I've added pasta, potato, changed the beans and have used cabbage in place of spinach. All good!

I used 2 cloves of garlic and sprinkled Romano cheese in before serving.  Incredible!
Note - I used the Johnsonville mild Italian sausage (ground - not the links).  It seems to be the best as far as taste and the leanest of the ground sausage I could find.

My husband and I loved this soup and it was perfect for Mn winter dinner.  Based on reviews and what I had on hand, I  made these chances: used a pound of combined hot and mild Italian sausage, extra garlic, potato, cannelloni beans, finely sliced fresh spinach,  can of 28 oz of plum tomatoes, orzo noodles and vegetarian no meat chicken and beef bouillon for stock.   "Thanks" Sally!

I really liked this and it was just what I was looking for to use up some sausage and spinach languishing in my fridge. The sausage was just plain pork sausage so I added extra italian seasonings. 4 stars because it wasn't too popular with my boys. But will make again just for me.

Quick and easy excellent soup for cool chilly winter nights.  I've made it using beef broth, chicken broth and once I used 1 can beef & chicken broths.  I have also added ditalini pasta to the recipe.  Serve with warm garlic bread for a hearty quick meal.  Can also add Tortellini's in place of ditalini pasta.

I LOVED the soup, the flavor was unique and excellent. I made some modifications - I used water and beef base instead of canned beef broth. Dry (soaked and cooked) beans, and home made stewed tomatoes. It took much longer this way, but the result was well worth it.

This soup was excellent, and even better the next day! Modifications: I used chicken/turkey sausage and one can of black beans instead of Northern beans. I also used about 32 oz of beef broth and a little finely chopped onion when I cooked the garlic and sausage together (Also, I browned the sausage/garlic and onions in a little coconut oil). Also I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, fresh spinach and sea salt. All organic ingredients. This is hands down the best soup I have ever made.

This is sooo good and simple. My 3 year old granddaughter helped me tear up the fresh spinach for this one. I only had one can of beef broth in my pantry so I added a cube of beef bullion and hot water to make up the difference. I also added frozen cheese filled tortillini in the last few minutes. There was enough leftover for lunch the next day. Even reheated it was very good..

Excellent soup, my granddaughter's favorite. We used turkey Italian sweet sausage instead...the pork sausage is too fatty & we prefer the taste of the turkey sausage. Otherwise we kept the ingredients the same.

A delicious, tasty soup. The only thing I omitted was the spinach (didn't have any on hand), but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee, and it was great. Our winters don't last very long here, but this is a recipe I may consider making year round.  :)  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I am a person who loves "cheffin'" and eating hot homemade soups!  Thought I would try this one. OMG, It was so SCRUMPTIOUS! It is very hearty and delicious.
I used stewed tomatoes that I froze from my garden in the fall. I also used half sweet and half hot italian sausage. I am big on beans so I added extra. 
VERY WERY GOOD RECIPE, thanks for sharing it!

I don't even like most of these ingredients (but my boyfriend does) so I made it as a favor. Goodness gracious, this is yummy! Leftovers went a little gross because of the sausage fat, though, so I'll make a smaller batch next time.

This was incredibly easy to make, and was at once a favorite soup for both my wife and I.  The only change (additions) I made was to add 1/8 tsp. of white pepper for a touch of background heat, and 1/2 pound of sliced mushrooms added in the last 5 minutes.

Fantastic!  My husband said it't the best soup he's ever had!  I used Italian sausage links and sliced into disks, and doubled the beans & tomatoes.  A great dinner soup with some fresh Italian bread.

Topped it with grated parmesan cheese! Yummy!

When I reheated the leftovers, I put the parmesan cheese in before I put it in the microwave, and it melted into extra gooey goodness!

I used Spicy Hot sausage, it was a little to hot so next time will use regular or half and half, and I will be making this many times!! Only change I made was to use more fresh spinach.

The only thing that I changed about this recipe was eliminating the salt. There was plenty in the sausage to add flavor. This was so good, I've made it 3 times already!

The recipe doesn't state type of sausage. I used cut up links and browned them with 4 cloves of garlic.  I substituted one can beef broth with vegetable broth and used about 2 cups carrots. The store did not carry canned "Northern beans" so I used white kidney beans. A 10oz bag of spinach is more than 2 cups but I probably could have put it all in. Will definitely make this again!  Served with garlic cheesy bread made from sub rolls. I love making soups; when my husband goes back for seconds, you know it's good!

It was a HUGE hit with a crowd last night! The recipe is good to go "as is;" however, I did add onion and both hot and mild sausage to vary the heat. A new "go-to" soup - thanks SALLYJUN!!

This was easy and very good.  I adjusted simmer times slightly to keep vegetables crisp as fresh and didn't add salt and pepper until the end, but otherwise did it as per the recipe.  This will become part of our menu plan for sure!

Super easy, hearty, most flavorful. When serving I sprinkled a finely shredded Italian blend of cheeses (Parmesan, Asiago, Mozzarella, Provolone and Romano) on top. Delicious and again super easy, served with garlic bread.

I'm not really big on soups, but this one is a keeper. Although I made a few changes to my taste, this is really a good soup. I have made it 3 times already and will make again. Good recipe.

I am a soup lover, so I suppose naturally, I loved this soup too. But, I would say that this easily fell into my top 5 favorite soups I've ever had. I usually adapt recipes quite a bit when I try them out to suit my own tastes, but the only change i made to this was instead of beans I used some potato gnocchi. Fabulous, I will definitely make it again!

This soup is outstanding!!  The only change was the Italian sausage.  I used Oscar Mayer Smoked Turkey Sausage.  This soup is easy to prepare and cooks quick.  I made it today and will add this to my favorite recipe list.  A bowl of this soup, salad, homemade rye bread with sweet roasted red pepper hummus  Yummmmmy!

Extremely delicious! After reading a few suggestions and wanting to use what I already had, I added some celery, used diced instead of stewed tomatoes, substituted spicy sausage, and used extra beef broth. Am looking forward to making this and eating it again and again.

This has become a favorite in our house. I too use low sodium broth and have added a small pasta to the soup on occasion. 

We have also made this with chicken sausage and substituted the beef both with chicken broth. So fun to experiment with the different flavors. Adele's has so many wonderful kinds to choose from.

I know I'm going against the majority (which normally doesn't happen), but felt this needed some more flavor.  I did add extra garlic, broth and stewed tomatoes, but it was jus lacking something.

Made this last night.  Super easy and super good!  I used a mixture of hot & sweet italian sausage (hot was lean turkey).  I did use 2 cloves of garlic and added 1/2 chopped onion.  I didn't measure the zucchini or carrots, just used 3 of each.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

This dish was quick, easy and delicious!  I used a spicy Italian sausage that came in links.  I cut the pieces into small meatball size and served the hot soup over rice.  My family loved it.  Only one suggestion for modification (it may have been the sausage choice), the dish was a little salty.  If you're sensitive to salt you might want to skip the 1/4 teaspoon add in.  L

This is a great soup, loaded with flavor. I also add  about one cup of chopped cerery, small pasta, and additional Italian seasoning and fennel seeds. It's a favorite in our home. I once  made it for a group of about 120 people and most asked for the recipe, it was a big hit!

I made this soup yesterday and my family absolutely devoured it. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers by adding an onion and also an extra can of beef broth making sure to use the low sodium as recommend by a previous reviewer. Served with a salad and garlic bread sticks......delicious!!!!!

This is even better made with pork broth, which complements the Italian sausage.  I use Knorr pork bouillon cubes.

This is a great while quite easy soup...I altered a bit...I used 12 oz of sweet italian chicken sausage sliced up.  I had to add a tiny bit of olive oil to pan to cook in the beginning.  I used 32 oz of chicken stock and S & W chopped italian tomatoes and white beans instead of norhern beans. To finish I used a tub of baby spinach....I WILL MAKE THI AGAIN AND AGAIN! and was easy to make after long day at work...")

I tried to make this just as written, but my grocer's was sold out of great Northern beans so I used chickpeas instead (it was all I had on hand). I used the spicy variety of Italian sausage since we like heat. It was delicious. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!  I'm a relatively inexperienced cook, so the one surprise was how long the carrots would take to prepare.  I would recommend using baby carrots to avoid the tedious task of peeling.  Other than that, everything was a piece of cake and it was amazing, a party for the taste buds!

So happy to have found this recipe! I have no doubt that this is perfect as it is but I added a tiny bit of leftover potatoes, onions, celery, and some italian seasonings.  For my own peronal taste, it looked like it needed more liquid so I used a tad bit extra chicken stock that I had left over from a previous recipe.  I would hold off on adding salt until you try the final result..then add salt to taste.  I also used Parks brand sausage which already comes nicely seasoned and flavored.

This is my first review but I had to say that this was simply delicious!  It would be delicious as it is written but I did add some onion and celery at the beginning and some macaroni and red wine later.  I also omitted the salt and subbed in some oregano and parsley.  Finally, serve with some grated romano.  Yum!  I will make this again and again.  Thanks!

What a way to warm up your day! Heart healthy soup. For the men in my family (as they are the meat lovers) Bob Evans Italian sausage adds the right balance of ingredients to satisfy the flavor of the palette.

Very good. Minor changes based on reviews, 3 cans of broth, just over a pound of sausage, 2 cans of tomatoes, 3 garlic cloves, 1/2 c. onions, 1/2 c. of orzo.  Wanted to make it go just a bit further. It was delicious served with crusty bread.

Found this before we went camping and made it that weekend. Was very easy to make in the camper. Made it as stated for lunch and it was delicious! I shared it with my neighbor at the campground and she wanted the recipe too. Next time I will drain the sausage on paper towels after cooking. To much grease after refrigerated. Just as good if not better the next day This one is definitly a keeper! Thanks

Very hearty and filling soup! Based upon previous recommendations, I browned the sausage in another pan then drained it, added an extra cup of (low-sodium) beef broth, 1/2 cup of orzo (pasta) and used fresh baby spinach, which worked out rather well! NOTE: If you like your veggies a little on the firmer side, remember to allow the pasta time to cook as the soup simmers! I live overseas and often have to rig a recipe because I cannot find ingredients, but this one was no problem at all! Nearly all of its ingredients are staples of well-stocked pantries and fridges! Note: Rated 4 stars because the flavor of the sausage was a little overpowering for the dish and I think this recipe would benefit from additional herbs (rather than spiced tomatoes), such as basil, oregano and thyme, if the chef has the time and inclination.

This soup was wonderful.  I did make a few minor changes, I added an onion.  I also added more broth, I used 2 quarts (two cans did not seem like it would be enough).  I also added 2 cans of beans, I used navy beans and I rinsed and drained them.  I was a hit at dinner.  I will be making this all the time.

A family favorite at our house.  The only change we make is substituting kale for the spinach which in our opinion makes this a 6 star soup.

This soup will win you multiple compliments from your guests! It has a tendency to be salty so do be careful in this realm. I would like to see more vegis in a soup for myself, but if served with salad, this certainly is a delicious soup.

This was very quick and easy to prepare.  My family loved it. I did add chopped onions though.  Had to make this again the following week for my niece.  She asked for twice the spinach.  It turned out great!

My husband said it was the best soup I ever made, and I have to agree!  Added 1/2 cup Orzo, already boiled, 1/2 onion, chopped and cooked with the sausage, 1/4 t. each basil and oregano, and a couple of fennel seeds. THANKS!!

I LOVED THIS SOUP!  I made this as a starter for my mothers 60th birthday. Most people requested 2nds and wanted the recipe. I used 1 package of regular and 1 package of spicy italian sausage. Came out beautiful!

What a hearty and satisfying soup!! The raves are worthy...i subbed italian sausage for chicken sausage, skipped the spinach and used tomato sauce (15 ounce) instead of stewed tomatoes. I also added quinoa which gave it a hearty texture. Fabulous!!

For our taste this needed more seasoning; more garlic, the Italian-style tomatoes just didn't have enough season so I added a teaspoon of basil and oregano.  I will use this recipe as a base adding onion and cheese tortillini, also using baby spinach so I won't be bothered with removing the stems and tearing, just put them in whole.

This soup was AMAZING and very easy to make.  My brother, who doesn't even really like Italian food, even liked it.  I recommend serving with some thick, crunch garlic bread.  Very filling, makes enough for lunch the next day too!

Wow! I wasn't expecting this to be that good. I didn't have italian sausage at home so used locker beef sausage and 1/2 of polska kielbasa. I never thought zucchini would be good in soup and I was really surprised to find I fished that out first with each bowl. I added 1 can chicken broth with the beef broth. My husband is diabetic so I never added any noodles/rice or such. This is a perfect, healthy, deliciously diabetic-friendly soup. I am making it again tonight!

By far, the best soup I've ever made.  It's easy, quick and tasty. Try it.  You won't regret it!!  To save time without compromising the taste, use one 10 ounce package of chopped spinach and keep on heat until thawed.

Surprisingly delicious! I'm giving it 4 stars because I prefer to use spicy Italian sausage...which makes it a 5-star recipe. Super easy, SUPER DELICIOUS! I ate about 4 bowls immediately after making it.

Very good, and what great vegetables.  I used hot sausage, extra garlic, chicken broth instead of beef, and extra tomatoes.  I used 1 low fat/sodium broth and 1 regular and did not add any salt, but I thought it was on the salty side.  Not sure why.  If I can reduce the salt flavor, I would top with grated parmesan.

Awesome recipe. I know it's wrong to change the recipe then rate it, so let me say I've tried it as written and it it wonderful. So now let me tell you my changes. First off, this soup is so good I doubled it so my additions are for twice as much. Trust me, it's that good. I used 1 lb. hot and 1 lb. mild sausage casings removed. And 1 small diced red onion when browning the sausage with the garlic. I upped the garlic to 3 cloves. 5 cans of beef broth, 3 cans of tomatoes, 3 carrots dided, 4 yellow squash diced, 4 zuchinni diced, 3 cans of northern white beans. 3 bags of fresh baby spinach, and 1 bag of frozen white corn added at the end. I honestly think this is "THE" best soup I've had from this site. I have tried many and enjoyed many but this is my new favorite. Thanks to SallyJun. Killer soup.

This is the most delicious soup I've ever tasted. I am only 15 years old and I am not an expert in cooking. I did it by myself and the soup was wonderful and all my family members loved it. Some modifications: Brown the sausages not with oil but with butter and add some mushrooms and 1/2 chopped potato (to reduce the salt). Do not use can broth but make it by yourself. Boil any kind of meat(e.x chicken) in water and the broth is ready.

That was my first review so . . .

Whatever the recipe was: How Americans say: YUM!

P.S Forgive me about the grammar errors or syntax errors because English is a foreign language for me . . .

Excellent soup and super easy to make.  Will definitely add this to my list of favorites!  Changes I made were minimal -used 32 oz beef broth and added 2 cups cooked pasta.  Next time, I will add even more broth since the pasta seems to soak it up overnight.

This soup is really good!  I just made a big pot so I could freeze some for a friend who has a broken hip.  I did make the following changes which I think improved it: use sweet Italian sausage, use 3 cans beef broth, add 1/2 diced onion and a sprinke of red pepper flakes when browing sausage, coarsely chop the tomatoes before adding and only use 1 cup torn spinach. I will be adding this to my favorite soups list.  UPDATE: By accident, used italian-flavored tomato sauce in place of tomatoes, and I liked it even better (if that's possible)!!!

Very good soup.  I did as suggested & used two cloves garlic & added one can low sodium chicken stock.  I also added uncooked pasta shells during the last 12 minutes of cooking (before adding frozen spinach), and they cooked up just perfect.  Delicious!  I'm sending this recipe to all my friends!

I love this soup! My husband loved it too. its very hearty and not bland at all like some of the other reviewers said. I found it to be quite tasty. I used all the original ingredients exactly like the recipe. Wonderful flavor. I may add an extra can of broth next time if I put rice in it. I do recommend it if your going to use pasta or rice in your soup.

Delicious!!!  My friends are all asking for the recipe.  I've made it twice now.
I didn't use the zuchinni because I don't care for it in soup. I did add 2 yukon gold potatoes(diced)along with the carrots.  The second time I used Turkey Store Italian seasoned ground turkey and it was just as good and less fat.  I also added a teaspoon of dried italian seasoning. Thanks!

Wonderful soup.  Based on other reviewers added 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet sausage, it gave it a great kick.  I also used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and added 1/2 of an onion and a little more broth.  Definetely a keeper thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  Made a double batch and added extra of garlic and spinach.  I even added a few cups of kale the next day because i like the greens in soup so much.  This was a big hit with my husband who ate it for two days for lunch and dinner!  The second day, I tried it with Ramano cheese grated on top as we do with most all of my homemade soups and it was perfect, wish we would have done it the first night.  So easy to make, so delicious to eat!  will make this often.

I followed this recipe just as it is written, except, I cooked the soup in a crockpot on high for 1 hour and then low for about 3 hours.  I added the zucchini after the first hour and I added the spinach during the last 45 minutes.  This soup is fantastic!  I served it with cornbread -- which is the perfect compliment, especially if you use spicy Italian sausage.  Thank you so much for this recipe... I will make this soup again and again.

I just made this soup and really enjoyed it as did all of my guests. I made some changes because of personal preferences and other user reviews. I used 2 cans of chicken broth (instead of beef broth), 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 box of frozen spinach, 1 cup orzo, and 1 tsp Italian seasoning. The flavor profile was really wonderful, especially the next day!

This is outstanding--restaurant quality soup.  The second time I made this, I used Honeysuckle White Italian turkey sausage and it was just as good and healthier.  I want to try orzo next time.  I'm sure I'll be making this every few weeks.

I made this for dinner last night, it was great. My husband and I loved it. I did read alot of the reviews and I did add two cans of beans, mashing one can and I added onions and celery.The consistency was like a stew, perfect with a ceasar salad and some bread. Thank you.

My favorite soup to date. I have had it on hand in my frig ever since the beginning of the year. Great for lunch or even as a meal for dinner. Everyone that I make it for raves over it.

We thought this was pretty good.  I substituted Jimmy Dean HOT breakfast sausage for the Italian sausage because I don't like fennel seed, which is in a lot of Italian sausages.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I may try this with kidney beans as they seem to have a little more "bite" than the great northern beans.  This would be good with an extra can of stewed tomatoes if you're a tomato fan.

Yum! Instead of cutting up sausage into pieces, I browned and crumbled up sausage patties - it was easier for the younger kids to eat the smaller pieces.

I used 1/2 hot Italian sausage and 1/2 mild, cut back on carrots and zucchini and added yellow pepper and asparagus--nice.  This was great for a family dinner with good bread, although it wasn't a finalist in the dinner group soup competition!

I used lean turkey sweet Italian sausage, which I drained and rinsed after browning.  I've made this twice, the first time exactly as written.  The second time, I added one extra clove of garlic, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, and just enough cayenne pepper to give it some warmth.  Fabulous!!  Once it's done, the broth is just out of this world delicious.  And it definitely gets better the next day.

This was DELICIOUS. I used diced tomatoes, added a little more broth, and at the end I stirred in some cooked elbow noodles. I would suggest draining the fat off the sausage before adding the broth.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was very good.  Colorful, hearty, and tastes even better the next day.
Next time, I will try the lower sodium chicken broth and see if it is still as satisfying.

The only complaint my husband had about this was that the tomatoes were too big, so I know I can make this one again. He even went so far as to say that it tasted like pizza. I browned the sausage with onions, garlic, carrots, celery, and some mushrooms that needed to be used up. The only other change I made was omitting the spinach.

This was really good. I used Hot Italian Sausage and the flavor from the sausage is in the broth!

When I came up with this recipe several years ago I combined what I liked about other recipes and made it easy as I am a lazy wannabe Itiliam.  Had no idea it would turn out so good.  Entered it on this website in 2001 and am thrilled that it turned out so versitile and everyone would love it as well as my family did. Whenever I need a lift I read your wonderful reviews.  Thanks...Karen

The Soup is phenomenal!! My husband and toddler children enjoyed it immensely. Breakfast sausage was used and not the link sausage. Though I suspect that link sausage is the original kind. The differential recipe still turned out spectacular! The ease and prep time makes this recipe a clear favorite.

We loved this recipe. We modified it slightly to our own personal tastes - left out the carrots and added 1 cup of frozen Italian cut green beans and 1 cup of mini penne pasta along with a couple "glugs" of Cabernet Sauvignon red wine. Loved it and will definitely make it again and again!

I thought this soup was all right.  It was nothing fantastic, and my husband told me not to make it again (although he is not a tomato fan, so he didn't like the stewed tomatoes in it).  I did have to make a couple changes, and maybe that was the problem.  I couldn't find italian sausage, so I used just regular sausage.  And then I also couldn't find Great Northern Beans, so I used canellini beans.  I also sprinkled a little mozarella on top after dishing it up.  I thought it was a good recipe, just not a great one.

I use spicy turkey sausage to make it lower fat.  I also saute onions in extra virgin olive oil, add the sausage and 2 cloves of garlic and cook until the meat is browned and the onions are translucent.  By adding freshly grated parmesan cheese on top of each bowl, you have made it a 5 star recipe.

Very good - hearty, full and bold taste, texture of carrots, beans and zucchini very pleasing! I served this to six friends, and they all raved. I served with focaccia bread to dip with. The only change I would recommend would be to add more beans and zucchini - 2 cans of beans, and 3 small zucchini. Other than that, very good!

I made some minor changes to this (turkey sausage, kidney beans), because that was what I had on hand. I wasn't overly impressed with this. My family ate it, but no one was crazy over this. The carrots tasted off, and we would have preferred more seasonings. This recipe just wasn't for us. Thanks though!

I agree, this was fabulous. The most time consuming task was browning the sausage. Next time I will add a chopped onion. I also used diced tomatoes and added dry Italian seasoning. We don't like soggy zucchini, so I added it a few minutes before the spinach. I used more spinach also, and topped with parmesan cheese.

This is a very good change of pace to the usual veggie soup. And PACKED with flavor and vitamins... but Shhhh.... we won't tell my 4 kids ages 13, 12, 10, n 8 that it IS good for you! ;o)

I did double the recipe, and used 5 sweet Italian sausages n 3 hot Italian sausages (removed casings prior to frying)and omitted the salt n pepper, as the sausages spiced it very well. This heated up real well the next day too.

My husband gave it a perfect 10 (we've been married 9 months and this is the first 10 I've gotten) ;) I added onion. Used chicken broth instead of beef, and I didn't have any zuchini so I added corn. It was really yummy and really easy.

Absolutely delicious.  1 I didn't think my husband would eat it because of the spinach.  (He says I should replace it with broccoli)  NOT!!!  To good the way it is.

I made this soup for New Years Party. I was so surprised that it was liked by all that dared to taste it. To hot for me, but my 80 year old Dad who doesn't like spicy loved it! There wasn't a spoonful left..Thanks

No time to shop in the a.m.  Browned 1 added 1 cup frozen peas and carrots. Cooked in crockpot all day. Added 1/2 cup cooked macaroni 45 min. before serving. It still turned out great. The sausage was very tender and the broth was delicious.

This is now officially one of my favorite soups.
I can't wait to make it on a cold winter night.
I'm a garlic lover, so I used 4 cloves, plus I added one large chopped Spanish onion, a handful of chopped fresh parsley thrown in with the spinach, fresh tomatoes instead of canned (nothing like fresh tomatoes in a soup!), and a few shakes of Italian seasoning. 
If you love a chunky, stick-to-your-ribs soup with tons of flavor and texture, this is for you!
DO NOT forget to pick up a fresh loaf of your favorite bread, because this soup practically begs for a good, old-fashioned Italian sopping up of the juices! Fantastic! Thank you!

Yummy!  Excellent and easy to make!  I read some of the other reviews and 1) took sausage out of casing, 2) added chopped onion with the garlic while browning sausage, 3) added 1/2 cup orzo, and 4) added two cups of water (I think it would have been too salty without the water.  Plus after adding all the ingredients, it needed more liquid).  I may try adding potatoes to leftovers tonight.  Try it!

Great- quick meal- used Louis rich turkey keilbasa, added carrots, an extra can of tomatoes and Italian cut green beans as another reviewer suggested. Used one box of frozen spinach. Cooked it in less than half an hour, topped with oyster crackers! Ill have enough for lunch the rest of the week- very healthy. Thanks

My family loved this recipe!  I did make some adjustments based on other recommendations.  I doubled the recipe, using half sweet and half hot Italian sausage. I added an onion, chopped, which I sauteed with the garlic.  I put the sausage, sauteed veggies, carrots, broth and tomatoes into a large crock pot and cooked on high for about 4 hours.  I added the beans for the last hour or so.  Then I cooked 2 lb. cheese tortellini and added it at the end.  I omitted the zucchini and spinach.  I also added some Tony Chatcheries Creole seasoning instead of salt, which gave it a little spicy zest.  My version was quite a bit different from the original, but was absolutely delicious.  The broth itself is outstanding!

This soup is delicious.  I buy the sausage links, partially cook them, slice them, then saute with garlic (I always add more garlic, too.)  Usually, I double the recipe, and buy the bagged spinach and use the whole thing.  Top it off with fresh parmesan reggiano cheese when serving.  Fantastic!

My whole family LOVES this soup...even my dear husband who says he doesn't like tomatoes, zucchini or spinach.  It's been a staple since I've been pregnant, too...I just crave it!

My husband and I both loved the soup, especially with freshly grated parmesan cheese on top.  However, we are not fond of zucchini and felt it overpowered the soup.  Would like to hear from others who may have omitted zucchini or substituted something for it!

I love spinach and this soup is awesome but for a large group of people 
Leave the spinach out. It does get wilty and a lot of people either don't like spinach 
or can't handle the slimy feel.  BUT, I still got rave reviews 
and everyone wanted to know how I made it.  
I would make this again and again!  I used cannellini beans.  
I also used extra spices, like Worcestshire sauce and onion when I cooked the lean sausage.

Awesome!!!!! Recipe easily doubles.  I added an extra can of beans.  I tried 2 boxes of frozen spinach instead of the fresh and it turned out fantastic.  Best soup I've ever tased and made.  Way better than my wedding soup.

very good and full of flavor but a little salty for my taste.  Next time I will modify a bit to adjust for the high salt content.

Excellent blend of flavors in a short cook time. Not too much preparation involved and a truly great combination of vegetables. I love soup and this one is going to become a favorite.

Relativly simple to make...I used both hot & sweet sausage...comments were it was too spicy. I thought it was a little too thin...next time I would reduce the amount of liquid from the beans. Only 1 kid liked it.Even the one who likes bean soup, didn't care for this.

This soup was very hearty, and tasty. I did make a few changes, such as using 2 extra cups broth, using 1/2 turkey sausage (pork sausage is just too fatty), and 1/2 cubed chicken breast, and adding 1 1/4 cup mini shell pasta with the beans and zucchini. I also added about 30 min. to the cooking time. All in all, however, I enjoyed this recipe very much, would reccomend it, and intend on making it again in the future.

This is an excellent winter soup. Instead of all sausage, I used 1/2 cooked chicken breast strips and 1/2 lean sausage. I omitted carrots and added onions and mushrooms. My husband and I loved it. Thanks for a recipe we'll use often.

YUM, YUM, YUM!

I added 4 more cups of broth (I just used the cubes mixed with water) and 2 big handfuls of small seashell pasta--and VOILA!  Instant hit!  

This is sooo wonderful on a cold, rainy day (like it has been here for 2 weeks...)  My boyfriend took the rest to work, and everyone loved it there too.  Thanks Karen!

It was amazing! I added one large onion which I sautéed with the sausage. I used two hot sausage links and 2 miles sausage links and one and a half bags of baby spinach. It came out thick like a stew and I made pasta on the side in case anyone wanted to add it.  FANTASTIC!!

It’s single, 49 year old dude easy!!!  Tastes fantastic and extremely easy to make.  Used spicy Italian sausage so it’s got some kick, which is how I like it and it looks like it’s gonna be hearty enough for my nutrition requirements. Good recipe

This has been our favorite winter soup recipe for years. I always make a double batch, great for lunch at work and to share with friends who always ask about that sausage soup! I also use half sweet sausage and half hot sausage, and use butternut squash instead of zucchini. The butternut is a nice addition to the contrast of sweet/savory in this soup. And lots of spinach as it withers away!

This is one of our favorite soups as a family. My oldest son loves taking it in his lunch, and my middle one (our pickiest child) doesn't protest. I have made it with and without the zucchini. Usually, I add kale, lots of onions, and barley. It's delicious however you make it. :)

Wanted something hearty for a rainy fall evening meal. My teenage son did most of the cooking and prep. I love this because it is all fresh wholesome ingredients. We added fresh basil from our garden and included some end of the season yellow squash. This meal was fantastic and it hit the spot. I am married to a Tuscan Italian and this soup passed the test of what Nonna used to make. Simple and yummy.

I love this soup. It is so easy and has such a great flavor. I tripled it recently for a Soup Supper at church and used two packs of mild and one pack of hot Italian sausage and it was just right. I took enough to fill my large crock pot to the church and rest I kept at home and it was a good thing! The crock pot was completely emptied before I served myself at church so I was happy for the extra I had left at the house!

I tweaked the recipe by adding chopped onions and celery.  I softened the vegetables in the fat rendered from browning the sausage.  Added an additional can of diced tomatoes, a tablespoon of dried Italian herbs and a bay leaf.  Increased the stock to 32oz.  I left out the salt since the canned beans were not rinsed and drain.  The soup was wonderful.  My husband said it was the best soup he had tasted in a long time.

Awesome!!!  I sustituted the italian sausage for a chicken sausage that had spinich and feta in it.  I also subsituted chicken broth for the beef broth. I added fresh parsley and green onion for extra flavor. It was quick and easy and I didn't miss the pasta at all. This is a hearty healthy soup with excellent flavor!!! 
I put it in my favorites- Playton1963

This is an extremely delicious and easy soup - one you can make on a weeknight!

I always make a new recipe exactly as written the first time, as a baseline. I don't play with it until I've seen what the original is like.

My only difference with this recipe is that I doubled the ingredients so I could freeze it (I read that it freezes well). I doubled everything, but thought it needed a third can (instead of two) of Italian recipe stewed tomatoes, and that made all the difference. Next time I'm going to try Rotel to see what happens.

I also think this soup benefits greatly from a longer cooking time if you can do it, because the flavors got more depth after 45 minutes uncovered. Just don't add the spinach until the last five minutes, because that must "cook" in the already hot soup with the lid on.

I will be making this recipe again and again for sure!!!

I loved this soup!! It was hearty with lots of flavor.   Before sautéing the sausage, I took it out of the casting.  I also added exact fresh garlic, orzo & used fresh spinach & kale mix instead of just spinach for exact taste.  Have exact beef broth ( low salt ) on hand for any soup leftover, because the orzo absorbs the liquid overnight:)  it was so Ymmmy !!!

Loved this recipe.  Made a couple of changes.  Used low sodium chicken broth,small white beans, axed the zuchini, and substituted chopped kale instead of spinach.  Didn't add any salt and it was just fine.  This was a BIG hit soup.  Can't wait til tomorrow night!

Delicious! I made it exactly according to the recipe, but I may add mushrooms or potatoes next time. Plenty of room for modifications. Although after all the mincing of garlic, chopping of carrots and zucchini, and tearing of spinach, it took closer to 2 hours, but definitely worth it. Great with some crusty French bread too!

This is so good. I did use a 1/4c red wine and extra garlic. Took the advice of others and used 2 stalks of celergy and extra beef broth. I did not use any salt. I did use low sodium beef broth. I made the soup with 1/2 Italian turkey sausage and hot regular Italian. Delicious!!!! Will make again.

Besides adding an onion and doubling the broth (low sodium)...I followed the directions.  Maybe I did something wrong b/c nobody in my house liked it at all.

Absolutely a great basic recipe with a lot of room to add or delete a couple of ingredients.  I use the Italian style diced tomatoes and rinse the northern beans (eliminates excess gas).  Also I drain the sausage after browning due to excess oil.  Love this with or without the spinach.

I've made this soup dozens of times.  We are outdoor winter enthusiasts and there is nothing better that a hot bowl of soup when you come in from the cold. The only thing I do differently is to add black beans rather than great northern and then I throw in about a tablespoon of dried thyme. You can use either mild or hot sausage but we prefer the hot.  Delicious.  Everyone I serve it to asks for the recipe.

This soup is tasty, quick and easy. I was looking for gluten free and hearty for my family. I doubled the recipe using J-ville mild Italian sausage and J-ville Hot Italian sausage. Just slice the casing to remove it and break meat into chunks in stock pot. Added a diced yellow onion. I skipped the garlic since the  stewed tomoatoes already have Italian seasoning in it. Used frozen spinach instead of fresh. Only thing I would do different is try to drain some of the grease after cooking meat before adding other ingredients.  Will make again.

This was such a great tasting soup! My family and friends loved it. It held up well even though I made it too far in advance. I would suggest timing it so that it is ready when guests arrive or shortly before. It does reheat well, but begins to look a bit ragged if cooked too long.

Yum!  I left out the beans because I am not a bean fan.  I substituted some cooked pasta instead.  I made this twice once with regular beef broth and once with gluten-free beef broth (for my gluten-intolerant friends) and both times it was delicious.

This is a huge hit with my family.  I lightened it up a little by using turkey sausage and low-sodium chicken stock, rather than the beef.  I used regular canned tomatoes and seasoned it myself.  I also used a whole bag of frozen carrots (I doubled the recipe for my family).  My husband and 4 kids couldn't get enough.  A favorite for sure.

Add 1/2 cup red wine to broth and 4-5 garlic cloves. But anyway you do it, it is the best.  I make it often and always get to print off the recipe for guests.

My tummy is happy after trying this soup. My husband loved it too. I didn't have spinach, so I used kale and added it with the carrots because it takes longer to cook than spinach. Very good. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I love this soup.  It works with almost any modification depending on what you have.  Just recently some kale and collards from last year's crop popped up in our garden and I used them in place of the spinach.  I had some frozen chopped zucchini from last year also and that went in too.  This is a four-season recipe.

I made it exactly as stated, and it was delicious, worth the full five stars. I made a few adjustments on my second and third batch to suit my taste. I substituted turkey sausage, used frozen chopped spinach, and increased all the other veggies. I like more veggies in my soup to increase how filling it is.

Really tasty and easy.  I left the beans out because the kids don't like them, still super yummy.  Will make again with different variations although I loved the zuccini and spinach with the tomatoes in this.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup is good. I used a cut up turkey sausage link instead of regular sausage to make this dish healthier. For a cold night or if you're in the mood for soup, I recommend this.

I love this.  We have probably made this at least 3 or 4 times.  2 times in the past couple weeks, it's so delicious!  It feeds us both a bowl for about 3 days (maybe 4).  The only thing we add is a whole onion, sliced, when adding the beans and zucchini.  We also use 2 packs of frozen spinach and throw in a handful (a little more than a cup) of shell (conchiglie) noodles that have already been cooked at the end with the spinach.  Excellent, excellent, excellent.  So fun to make and you could really put anything in it.  The beef broth/italian tomato soup base is outstanding alone.

Great soup!  I used hot italian sausage, had a can of chick peas already in the pantry, did not have zucchini, and had frozen chopped spinach.  It was a great tasting recipe even with changing to fit what I already had on hand.  Hot sauce topped it off.  Will make again!

Excellent soup.
I followed everyone's suggestion. I added RED PEPPER FLAKES instead of using spicy sausage because my kids do not like spicy foods, 4 GARLIC CLOVES-PRESSED (we love garlic!), 4 CANS BEEF BROTH, ITALIAN DICED TOMATOES, 1 RED POTATO-DICED, CANNELLINI BEANS, ZUCCHINI, COOKED MACARONI NOODLES, SPINACH, ITALIAN SEASONING, FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER CORN, and OMITTED SALT. 
The soup was excellent-6 stars!

Delicious!  Best soup recipe on the internet.  I use a box of frozen spinach instead of fresh spinach and often use turkey or chicken Italian sausage.

This was awesome!  I feed four adults and as written, even though it says 6 servings, it would not have fed us.  I added another can of broth, more carrots, and another can of beans.  This was really good with a loaf of garlic bread.  Will be making it again.

I've made it twice and it's already a family favorite. I like it because it's flexible. I've made with red potatoes once and orzo pasta the other time. It's better with the potatoes...

This soup was fabulous!  I didn't have any italian sausage on hand and didn't have time to go to the store. So I used mango-jalapeno sausage cut into small chunks.  Gave the soup a spicy punch and the next day it was even spicier!  My boys loved it too.  Next time, I'll try the italian sausage.

Great recipe.. I made a couple of changes to it. First I doubled the recipe cuz we are big soup eaters in my house, I used half mild sausage and half hot, I bought the pre-packaged minestroni veggies from Wegmans. I used 2 of these instead of the canned carrots and the zuchinni, and added some italian spices to taste. will def. make this again...

Okay, I'm not stupid. I followed this recipe very closely. I only added some of the other suggestions like oregano and doubling up on the beef broth. But i'm confused, I cooked the packaged italian sausage, this recipe says nothing about cutting it up (since mine was in links) I'm guessing it was supposed to cook it like ground beef. Anyway, I cooked it in the garlic, then cut up the italian sausage into bite sized pieces. Put in 2 cans of tomatoes, no carrots, 2 cans of northern beans, no zucchini, and let it simmer for 15 minutes. I also added two small yellow potatoes (cubed) which took A LOT longer to cook,(i think this is when it started to thicken) and then separately cooked a cup of pasta, drained and rinsed and then added. Mind you, if this is not eaten immediately, it turns into a big pot of mush!!

This soup is absolutely delicious! I made this tonight for dinner and my hubby loved it as well as my 6 yr old and 3 yr old. Very healthy too is a plus! I made a few additions to mine. I 3 small cubed up white potatoes. 2 cans of the stewed tomatoes. I added 1/2 cup small alphabet pasta (kids really got a kick out of that) some water too since I added more ingredients. a dash of oregano & a dash of dried parsley. I just used the ready made shredded carrots too for a short cut.. This will be a staple in our house for sure. Must for winter weather :)

So this was AMAZING! The hubby loved it. I did a few things different but kept the idea of the soup the same. Used two cans of diced tomatoes because I didn't have stewed. Added two handfuls of zucchini and a handful of spinach. Added lots of minced garlic and a bunch of different spices along with a bit more broth. Some spices I added was a dash of red pepper, lots of basil, some oregano, dried chopped onion. Very good.

Exellent! Soup is not something I usually would make so I was a little hesitant however this was very flavorful! I did follow others advice of adding an additional can of tomatoes, chicken broth and small pasta as well as omiting the zucchini and additional salt. Was a hit with the whole family. Thank you SALLYJUN for sharing your recipe with us all.

Another winner.  I followed the recipe except used frozen chopped spinach.  Next time I make it I might add some basil just to lift the flavour a bit.  I can't leave a good recipe alone.

We loved this soup! I added more broth to it, because I love soup broth! The store was out of zucchini so I substituted it with yellow squash, which was okay, but I would have preferred the zucchini. I did top it with a little freshly grated Parmesan cheese and that was the "frosting." Great recipe and extremely inexpensive.

We loved this soup.  The only thing I did different was to throw some Parmesan on the table.  I did slice the sausage, next time I will break it up.  I also threw in some red wine I needed to use up.

Quick, easy, tasty, and with using chicken sausage and slightly bumping up the veggies amounts, healthy too-- perfect dish.  It's a keeper!

Perfect Sausage soup.  I used Red Pepper Provolone Sausage and it was DELICIOUS.  I added more garlic (out 5 cloves total), omitted the salt and replaced it with Italian Seasoning.  I will be making this again, for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

AMAZING! I made it for my boyfriend and our college buddy, and they are not the "soup" type, more meaty chili and they were amazed. It changed their whole perception of having soup for dinner!!! It is fun to customize!

Wonderful recipe. I made it twice using kale instead of spinach and turkey Italian sausage. Excellent. But........next time I will use good quality pork Italian sausage--the spicy kind.  Sometimes you just gotta go for the extra flavor that the extra fat provides.

This was excellent.  It didn't say whether the sausage was hot or sweet; I used sweet.  The only thing I changed was to add 1 tsp. of grated parmesan cheese on the top of each of bowl.  It will make great lunches for school next week.

Great wintertime hearty soup.  I made a few changes -- added a tsp or so of red pepper flakes, about half an onion, and i had some celery i was trying to get rid of.  I felt like the flavor from the garlic and italian stewed tomatoes needed a little boost, so i added in a shake of italian seasonings.  I know, that's a lot of changes, but it turned out really really well and was even better the next day.

Very good! Mine was too salty though; next time I will rinse my beans and add no salt till the end, if it's even needed. I love that you could put yellow squash, green beans, pasta, whatever you have that sounds good in. I will make again for sure.

Outstanding!!  I couldn't beleive how simple and how delicious this soup was.  My husband raved about it and even my 11 year old said it was good.  I didn't add the zuccini because they didnt look good this time of year.  I bought the great northern beans that were not seasoned and I added 2 cans of regular beef broth.  I just didn't season with salt and the soup was fine since I knew I was going to be adding cheese.  I used a whole bag of spinach and about a cup of cooked ditilani pasta.  I simply served this with garlic bread.  I will be making this again for sure!

Great recipie.  My wife isn't a sausage fan so was skeptical when I made this but even she ate several bowls and said this was a keeper.  The only thing I did was double the recipie and use 1 Pound of Italian and the other pound of Hot sausage because I like a little kick, but the recipie would stand without the change.  Just a simple, great, filling recipie.

Wonderful Italian Sausage Soup recipe. The soup had a surprising amount of flavor coming together to please our taste buds. I made one slight change - I drained and rinsed the beans, then added one cup of water.

YUMMY. I made this along with Super-Delicious Zuppa Toscana soup (a must try ;-). I couldn't decide which to make & settled on both, HA! Both excellent. Pretty much made recipe as stated other than using yellow zucchini. Recipe would work well with chicken broth if you don't have beef on hand. I used a combination of both, as that's what I had. My family loved BOTH soups! Garnished with a blend of grated parm, asiago & romano chesse .... heavenly!

Absolutely a favorite! I used italian chicken sausage and cooked the sausage and drained it well before using it in the soup to make it more WW friendly.

I made it w/ Trader Joe's chicken Italian sausage, which is healthy but bland. I sauteed 1 chopped yellow onion & 4 cloves squeezed garlic, plus 2 stalks celery diced, in EVOO. Used XL 23 oz cans of both cannelini beans & plain chopped tomatoes.Upped carrots to 1 1/2 cups. Added plenty of oregano, basil and 1 bayleaf.Used 2 bunches chopped kale (stems discarded.) Served over orzo w/ romano cheese. Healthy & fabulous!

Mmmmmmm.. nice and flavorful and oh so easy! I love cooking like this. I switched up the beans to Navy beans, we like a smaller bean, I thought about using diced italian tomatoes instead of the stewed, but so far I've stuck with the stewed. Wonderful aroma too!! I cannot make enough of this soup and have shared this recipe over and over!! Best soup I've ever eaten!!

This was an excellent soup!  I subsituted the beef broth with a homemade stock that I had in the refrigerator.  Since I didn't have zucchini I used bok choy and spinach. I left out the beans and was worried that the soup wouldn't be as hearty.  It was delicious and filling. I just finished the leftovers for lunch and wish I had more. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent...hearty, warm - a great soup!  I love soups as you can customize them so easily - I only had 2 medium hot Italian sausages, so I sauteed my garlic with those and I also added a few stalks of chopped celery.  I only had white kidney beans on hand, so subbed them in for the Northern beans.  Added approximately 2 cups of cooked small pasta (ditali) when I added the spinach.  Yummy meal on a cold night!

My husband keeps requesting this. I used hot turkey sausage. I made some changes based on reviews: 
- Subbed beef stock for broth and doubled it.
- Added meet or cheese tortellini instead of the beans.
- Added more carrots and an onion.
- Added a can of Rotel with the tomatoes
- Added some chipolte chili powder for a smokey flavor.
This is definitely company food!

We loved this! So easy to make in about an hour.
Add seasoning and keep things on hand for a delicious meal. Double the recipe to save for left-overs!

Excellent soup and easy to make.  Ingredients were somewhat unclear as to what type of Italian Sausage to use.  As a result and act of faith that it was going to be super yummy I doubled the recipe and mixed both bulk mild italian as well as hot italian which I took out of the casings before cooking.  The combo of both provided a spicy yet not-too-hot flavor.  I also more than doubled the garlic but made no other changes.  Excellent recipe!  Could easily add some other things in like macaroni or sliced potato too but why mess with something that is so good to start with?!  Thanks!

Excellent! I used beef stock because I had it, added a chopped leek and used turkey sausage plus a chopped hot pepper also added another clove of garlic, some celery flakes and a couple shakes of basil, MMMmmmm. It would be good with a little cooked macaroni tossed in at the end, too. Will make this again and again, Thanks!!

Delicious recipe for this cold winter day!  I used 1/2 Italian and 1/2 hot sausage and added one more can of stewed tomatoes.  I do not drain the sausage but rather wait until the soup cools, then refrigerate and remove the fat from the top.  I'm a bean fan so I might add another can of beans the next time.

Great soup! I used chicken sausage instead of the regular Italian sausage this calls for. A tad healthier. My step-dad is rather...particular...with his food, and he really enjoyed this!

Mmmm! I changed some things (soups are great b/c they're so easy to mix up and change without messing them up). I used kale greens instead of spinach (regular kale would work too). I used both chicken and beef broth and used 3 cans total. I added potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and some minced, fresh sage (b/c I had it laying around). I also threw in half an onion with the garlic/sausage (because I can't make soup w/o onion!). As you can see, I added a lot to the soup, hence the extra broth. Also, I used venison sausage!!! Yum yum yum, and healthy too!

I make soup once a week at our house so I am always looking for great soups... My husband is a meat lover and my daughter is a vegetarian so I look for recipes that can go both ways... I made a small pot without the sausage for my daughter and she loved it... Made two small changes... omitted the tomatoes (hubby can't eat them) and added a small can of tomato sauce as a replacement and felt that it needed a little tang so I added a couple of tbs of balsamic vinegar... this soup was delicious... also used 1 zuchinni and 1 yellow squash because the zuchinni at my store was poor quality...

Really delicious, although I didn't make it as directed, so take this review with a grain of salt. I didn't have potatoes or spinach so I substituted half a cup of medium grain rice and kale. I also didn't have beef broth so I substituted chicken broth. I also added shallots and parsley. Even with these changes it was delicious.

Really liked this soup. I made it with yellow squash instead of zucchini because they were out at my grocery store. The squash gave it a pretty good flavor. Other than that and low sodium beef broth, I followed this recipe. I definitely will make it again.

Edit: I made this soup again, this time with the zucchini. I actually liked it a little better the first time with the yellow squash, but it was still delicious. Thanks for this recipe!

Absolutely delicious!!!  I removed the sausage from its casing and browned it.  Completely forgot to pick up beans at the store, so I didn't add them, but I didn't miss them, either.  Added some dittalini pasta (precooked so it didn't absorb too much of the broth) at the end with the spinach.  Served with some freshly grated parm cheese on top, and crusty Italian bread.  Will be making this again and again!!

A good soup to have when you're sick or on a cold day.  I made couple of changes (which also included another reviewer's recommendations):

A. Italian sweet sausages were used, casing was taken off.

B. I used Cannellini beans instead.

C. 2 cans of Italian style stewed tomatoes.

D. 1 onion, sliced.

E. 1 jalapeno (chopped).

This soup is so good, my husband loved it and he's a picky eater! I used 2 small carrots, 5 white mushrooms (finely chopped), 1 white onion, 1/2 cup frozen chopped spinach and canned diced tomatoes since that's what I had on hand. I also threw in some dried basil, oregano, red chile flake and a bay leaf.

Like other reviewers has said, it is a good basic minestrone recipe. I like to dress mine up with ditalini pasta, and freshly grated parmesan and chopped parsley at the end. Also, a good can of tomatoes goes a long way here. I use ( and always use) a can of  Nana San Marzano tomato which I bought it from Costco.

Perfect soup for a chilly day!  I used chicken broth, didn't have beef.  And I added mushrooms in with the tomatoes.  So good, we will be making this again.  Thanks!

This is one of the best soups I've ever had.  I added bite sized golden potatoes since I didn't have zucc., used a box of broth, matchstick carrots and pinto beans.  I honestly don't think you could go wrong no matter what you add.  Soooo good!

This recipe is so good and I didn't feel guilty one little bit while eating it.  I usually double the recipe (everything but the sausage) because the leftovers are even better.

Very tasty! I drained the fat after I browned the sausage before adding the other ingredients. I used a 32 oz container of beef sirloin broth instead of the 2 14 oz cans. Because I had extra broth, I added 1 1/2 c. of brown rice elbow pasta. Cooked the pasta separately & added it to the soup about a minute before I served it.  My husband is not a big carrot & zuchinni fan so I chopped them into small cubes.  Put some shredded parmesan cheese on top of each serving after I put it in the bowl.  My husband had two bowls of it, he loved it so much. Thanks Sallyjun, definitely a keeper!

this was incredible. the boyfriend and i loved it! followed the directions, and used organic, low sodium broth (even less sodium than low sodium broths). and it came out perfect, no additional salt needed. the zucchini were perfectly done and had great texture, and i used a pound of spicy italian sausage for a little kick. really, really wonderful - it will become a staple item! thanks for sharing!

I'm more of a creamy soup person, but this was really yummy.  I topped the soup with quite a bit of parmesan cheese and served with bread.

This soup had such a great aroma to it.  I changed the recipe a little cause I had to use what I had on hand.  I think it came out fantastic.  Especially if you are a garlic lover.  Here are my changes:  I used a package of precooked garlic chicken sausage.  I just removed the skin and cut into 1/4 inch pieces.  I used chicken broth instead of beef and I used two cans Italian-style stewed tomatoes.  I did not add the salt as I think the chicken broth has plenty in it.  I added a diced onion, basil and oregano.  Serve it with crusty bread and grated parmesan cheese.  YUM!

Awesome simple yummy and hearty soup. Perfect for winter. I used sweet sausages I added more garlic. I also added raw orzo to mine and it turned out fantastic. Be careful adding raw orzo because it will absorb a lot of the broth. Either add more broth or cook your orzo in its own pot before adding it to the soup.

Absolutely delicious! We served this with sliced French bread and roasted garlic. Instead of fresh spinach, I used two packages of frozen spinach (thawed and drained/squeezed).

This was fabulous. I made it as written, except I didn't add salt (it didn't need it at all). I used 2 mild and 2 hot Italian sausages. Make sure to take the casings off the sausage before trying to brown. Oops! I think I might have cooked the sausage a bit too long because it was slightly too chewy, but everything else was fantastic. Oh, the cooking time took a lot longer for the carrots. I waited until they were done before I added the baby spinach leaves.

There is a reason so many people have reviewed this recipe.....because it is amazing. I could not believe how good it turned out and everyone just loved. It will definately be a staple in my home. Followed some other reviewers sugesstions; add onion, doubled garlic, used a little extra beef broth (low sodium), cut out the salt and added mushrooms. Served it over orzo.

So good! I left out the zucchini only because I didn't have any. Added an extra 2 cups of broth (I used vegetable broth, because that is all I had). Was fantastic! Bet the leftovers will be better today - but I missed out on them, Hubby already took them with him.  Definitely a keeper! Great because you can adjust it to what you have on hand. Thanks so much!

So good!! Increased garlic, added an onion.  Accidently used crushed tomato (28 oz).  Broke some spaghetti up and added it -- worked great.  Used frozen spinach.  Can't mess this soup up! Will make again!

This is so delicious and so easy to make. I love it! However, I use Italian turkey sausage. I bumped up the garlic just a little bit too and added about 1/2 cup of elbow macaroni.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Very good recipe. I did make a few changes based on my family's taste. I swapped celery for the zuchini and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I also drained my beans and added ditalini pasta. Served with a great crusty bread and sprinkled fresh parmesean cheese on each bowl. Will be adding this to my rotation.

I doubled the recipe and took it to a church function.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  There was none left to bring home.  I add some barley to it and used white beans.  I will be making this again.

Super easy, super good. I've made it twice in a week. I do drain and rinse the beans (to keep it from getting too starchy) and found that it didn't need any salt.

Excellent, hearty soup. Used frozen spinach instead of fresh, and actually used Italian venison sausage and it was a hit! Had several requests for the recipe. Planning on making it again soon.

This soup was excellent! I made a few changes based on other recommendations and personal preference.  I first browned the sausage with a bit of EVO in a large pot, then removed the meat and sauteed onion, celery and carrots. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used homegrown orange ones which are slightly sweeter and a bit less acidic and added them in with the homegrown zuke and liquid to cook a bit longer. I used my own blend of italian seasoning, including a bay leaf which was extracted before serving. I also added white wine and substituded homemade roasted garlic for garlic cloves. I did not add the liquid from the beans, but did rinse them and tossed in a few handfuls of macaroni as they were on hand. Orzo or other italian soup pastas would work just fine, but it thickened up the soup and there was no need for the bean liquid. I garnished with fresh grated parm and it was absolutely delicious!

This recipe was SO good!  I forgot the spinach, but will add next time.  I followed the recommendations from other reviews and added a bit of small pasta, two diced potatos as well as some spices.  My boyfriend never eats leftovers but was asking for more for the next 2 days!

Yum!  I didn't add the extra salt.  Used turkey sausage and low-sodium broth.  Maybe add a second can of beans next time.

Wow!! This is one of the best soups I've ever tasted!  I gave 4 stars only because I made two changes- I used spicy italian sausage and added about 1 1/2 cups cooked miniature pene pasta. I took it to a carry-in lunch and got rave reviews from everyone!  It was a very simple and healthy dish that I will make over and over!

I made this recipe as written, and the soup was wonderful.  I used sweet italian turkey sausage removed from the casing.  The prepped vegetables looked beautiful on my counter -- the fresh green spinach, the deep orange carrots, the crisp zucchini dices and the fragrant garlic... this soup is nutritious and delicious!

This recipe blew me out of the water. I was not expecting for it to be as tasty as it was. I'm not big into soups, but I can guarantee I will probably make this recipe a dinner staple. I served it with the 4 Cheese Margherita Pizza (recipe here on allrecipes.com) and it was a family hit. Versatile recipe though, I can imagine alot of stuff it would be good with, anything starchy.

you can't mess this up.  i add whatever canned beans i have.  try adding pasta too.  just boil pasta seperately and add to soup.  that way it won't absorb the yummy broth.  my hubby and kids love this.

I made this recipe two days ago, and did not vary from the instructions/given ingredients. I originally thought I'd need to add additional spice, but no -- this recipes is perfect as is. Very delicious! I think it would also be great with turkey italian sausage, and will try that next time. The soup also reheats well -- we polished the leftovers off today for lunch.

I really love this recipe.
Since we only buy kosher meat, it is hard to find "italian sausage" so instead I use kielbasa (spicy sausage) and it tastes great.

also I was thinking- this could easily go vegetarian if someone uses morningstar sausage links which are really good.

The best!!

Changed I made:

chicken broth instead of the beef, sauted 1 chopped onion and celery.  Used white kidney beans, fresh baby spinach 1/4 cup small pasta soup noodles.

Someimes, I make mini meatball with ground pork, ground beef, 1 egg, bread crumbs and parsley. I roast the meatballs and throw them in the soup.

Be careful not add too many meatball...you don't want a super thick soup.

It is so good!

Very flavorful, colorful, and easy! I made mine in the crockpot, adding the zucchini and beans the last two hours. A half hour before serving, I added the spinach. (frozen - thawed) Everyone loved it...my husband said, "Curiously, very good!" :)

Great! I sliced skinless turkey sausage and used fresh green beans, frozen corn, black eye pea, carrots, zucchini, green pepper and fresh parsley. I added one extra can off broth since my crock pot was over flowing with veggies. I think it may taste even better the next day! Thanks!

Nutritious and hearty. A great soup to herald the fall. I used chicken sausages, added a diced onion, a sweet potato for the carrots (but diced in small cubes for quick cooking), leftover al dente pasta, skipped the zucchini, and added a heaping teaspoon of italian seasoning, a tsp of Worchestershire sauce, and a tsp of A1 Black Peppercorn. That last addition was a whim and was so good! That small amount added heat and a new dimension. Just if you have any on hand. This is comfort food express and easily customized to accommodate leftovers!

Very good recipe.  I usually add 1 tsp of Splenda to this recipe and serve it  topped with grated Parmesan cheese.  Served with crusty bread it's a meal in itself.

This was a very good soup - I'm not a big fan of italian sausage but I wanted to try something different, and we ended up liking this a lot! I didn't include the spinach, but used cabbage instead and whatever other veggies I had around, and I ended up having so many veggies in it that I forgot to put in the beans!  I may try using chicken broth next time, but we were very pleased with this.

Absolutely delicious!  The sausage gave this soup such a great flavor.  My son asks for this all the time, whether hot or cold weather!  This recipe is on my rotation and leftovers always get eaten.

I've never written a review before, but I tried this recipe and thought that it was absolutely wonderful!  My husband hates carrots, so in place of them I added a cup of chinese green beans (cut into one-inch pieces).  Great great recipe that the whole family LOVED.

So tasty and super easy. I used potatoes, extra garlic, fresh spinach and half spicy half sweet sausage and didn't put the beans in. 
Served with the Best Veggie Sandwich. mmmmmm

Great base, but as written, a little bland. After adding more veggies(more garlic, onion, potatoes, celery, & corn) and some more seasonings (beef bouillion granules, marjoram, basil, parsley & red pepper flakes) we loved it. Will make often, but with my additions.

I'm keeping this recipe forever.  It came out fantastic.... except next time i may skip the spinach because i overboiled it and it turned stringy so i tried to fish as much out as possible.  Thats a knock on my own bad cooking technique not the recipe though.

I added orzo pasta and doubled certain parts of the recipe (stock & sausage+ add more veggies) to fill the stock pot so i have enough to freeze for later.  I used a couple of types of beans (cannolini, northern beans and chick peas) to mix it up a bit.  Wonderful recipe.

yum yum yum! A hearty, delicious soup that you can feel good about eating. I made a few changes that came out absolutely perfect. I heeded others advice and added an additional 2 cups of broth. I also took the sausage out of its casing and made little meatballs as another cook suggested...what a great idea! Being a potato lover, I cut two white potatoes into eighths, with the skin on and tossed them in with the broth. I also used Cannellini Beans instead. Lastly, I added some fresh parsley and an additional clove of garlic.  I let the soup simmer for about 1 hour and a half on low, stirring occasionally. Make this soup...you will not regret it! YUM.

This is very good recipe!  I used chicken broth b/c it was all that I had - but then added 2 beef bouillon cubes.  This made it have a richer flavor.

This soup was a crowd pleaser!!! Very taste, instead of spinach I used kale (holds up better in soup) it was very reminiscent of a northern soup called kale soup. If you used spicy sausage it could pass for a better version of zuppa tuscana from Olive Garden.

Oh man ohman... this was good.  we used turkey sausage to cut down on the fat, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  After the first bite, our dinner guests asked for the recipe.  This will be a staple in our house.

I used half mild and half hot Italian sausage and drained the fat after browning, otherwise I made no changes; I usually doctor up recipes, but this soup didn't need it, this soup is absolutely wonderful as written!

This is a great soup!  Perfect for those cold winter nights.  I've made this several times and I have choosen to omit the spinach because I don't the like the texture once it's been in the fridge.  However, if your family is going to eat it all in one night (which they might after a first taste)...go for it.

This recipe was a pretty good starting point. I used a few of the recommendations from other reviewers.  Adding celery and onion as well as a couple of red potatoes and then orzo pasta at the end.  I used fresh spinach and italian seasoning as well.

This was SOOOO yummy! I used hot Italian sausage and my hubby and I really enjoyed it this way. I didn't give any to the kids ( way too picky lately!) so there was more for DH and I! I'm planning on making this again soon. It's great on a cold winter night.

Deeeelish! Even the leftovers were scrumptious! I didn't add the spinach as I thought it would be too much - used 1.25 lbs of sweet basil sausage - YUM. Toss in some fresh shredded parmesan to your soup bowl & it is YUMMY.

This is very, very good and quite versatile. Let me get something out of the way that I disagreed with.... the recipe says to use the liquid with the beans, but I ALWAYS RINSE THE BEANS.... I can't imagine pouring that junk into my fresh, homemade soup!

I like to saute most of my ingredients before I put them in the soup (except tomato). 

I only made a small batch using leftover sausage and peppers.  To begin, I made a broth of two cups of Wylers granules (bullion), but generally I enjoy Emeril's beef stock, which is outstanding... much better than beef broth, powered or canned. 

In a saucepan I combined to lightly simmer the leftover sausage and peppers with the beef broth, fresh salt and pepper, 2 fresh basil leaves and about 2/3 can of plain diced tomatoes. 

Meanwhile, I chopped and sauteed celery, green onion and yellow squash for about ten minutes. I rinsed the navy beans and    combined it all together.

It was tasty and delicious and I'll make it again. I didn't have any spinach, but I would definitely like to try that next time.

I would also enjoy trying it over Ditalini pasta, which holds up well with soup.

Enjoy!

This soup was really good!  I used half sweet and half hot sausage (and no salt).  My husband doesn't like too much sausage flavor but he loved this soup!  It was fast and easy to make.

Like others mentioned, I added orzo.  I also added extra red pepper flakes to give it a little zing.  Everyone loved it.

I made this recipe as written.  My husband and I loved it!  He said I shouldn't change a thing when I make it again.  He described the flavor as rich!  It was a little time consuming, but now that I've done it once, next time will go faster.  I may try adding a little more broth and tortellini next time.  I was surprised how much this made, so if I do add more, I'll need a bigger pot.  This was excellent

Loved it.  I added a cubed potato and a bit more broth.  I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of one and used hot sausage to give it a kick.  Simmered it for about an hour or so to let the flavors blend, then added the fresh spinach right before serving.  Would also be great in the crockpot.  Served it with warm french bread and sprinkled grated Parmesan over the top. A keeper!

This recipe wasn't as good as I had expected - it was just 'OK' for me.  I made the soup as is and thought the flavor was 'OK.' (as always, I use the best quality ingredients I can find at Whole Foods).  I didn't drain the grease from the sausage, and I am glad I did so because it helped with the flavor.  I think for this recipe to be a really good "Italian" sausage soup, it has to have the Italian trinity for soups (onion, carrots, and celery).

I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.  I made just a few changes.  I thought I had the northern beans but were navy beans instead so I used what I had on hand.  I also thought I had a bag of fresh spinach and only had frozen.  I will not make that mistake twice.  Otherwise, I used just plain sausage and we both really enjoyed it.  Next time I'll use fresh and see if it tastes better.

MMM MMM Good!  I couldn't seem to get my hands on fresh spinach so I used swiss chard instead, otherwise followed the recipe oh except that I used a litte tomato juice with the broth too.  I served it for dinner and watched in amazement as both kids (10 & 5) ate it all up...beans...zucchini...swiss chard...!!  What a great way for them to get all those veggies in :D

A great soup and very easy to make!  

I made this for lunch with my sisters, and we all loved it.  I used kale instead of spinach and a very spicy Italian sausage.  I'll use this recipe again and try different veggies and another type of sausage in it just for variety.

WOW! The best sausage soup ever! I love a good hearty soup in the winter and this really hits the spot. I used Hot Italian sausage, added chunks potato from one medium potato, half cup of frozen green beans, half cup of ziti pasta and used black beans. Also, I added one more cup of beed broth as original recipe comes out too thick like stew. Will cook this soup all winter long!!!

I give the original recipe 3 stars. I love sausage soup so I expect it to be the best. I subed the Northern Beans for little pasta shells. Left out the spinach. It definitely needs more sausage. I left out the carrots as I just couldn't see these fitting in. I also added a lot more pepper and 2 garlic cloves to the soup (not sausage). It's a great recipe to start off of and add your own things.

Tuscan Soup on this site had been my favorite but this replaces it (although I will continue to make both!).  I used chicken broth instead of beef but that is my preference when I make soup with sausage.  Didn't have stewed tomatoes so used canned diced tomoatoes already seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano.  Omitted the zucchini since we don't care for it.  Made this a day ahead of time so I used another reviewers suggestion and added the canned beans and spinach when I was reheating it so they wouldn't get too soggy.  Really a quick, simple soup to make - it does get better and better as it sits!!!

Personally I didn't care much for this soup but my husband actually LOVED it!  Even requested we freeze the leftovers, and he's not fond of leftovers.  I think the stewed tomatoes I used needed to be diced.  I doubled the garlic and added mushrooms, decreased it to one zucchini since we're not huge fans.  It was healthy and fairly lo-cal, so I'm going to keep tinkering.

All I can say is YUM! This was sooooo good the first night, and even better as leftovers! I do suggest adding the spinach as you reheat the dish, rather than in the first big batch, otherwise it will get a little soggy. This was awesome, perfect for a chilly winter day!

I always prepare a recipe exactly as written the first time and then make changes on subsequent preparations.  This needs no changes, although other vegetables or pasta or rice can be added to it.  It is excellent!

GREAT!!!  However, since my hubby doesn't like beans I substituted another can of tomatoes and 1/2 cup macaroni when I added the zucchini.  Also added a good TBLS. Italian Seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  I used Hot Italian Sausage and 1 can regular beef broth and 1 can low salt broth.  This was really a great meal for a winter evening.  I served garlic bread sticks to "sop" up all the juice!

This is a very unique and delicious soup!  Our family (both kids included) really liked it.  I've made this recipe several times since finding it here last year.  Depending on what you're in the mood for heat-wise, add HOT Italian sausage to clear your sinuses!  If you happen to double the batch (in order to have leftovers), you may want to seperate it out before adding the spinach...the spinach is seems to get pretty soggy by day two.

What an awesome soup! I took the advice from other reviews and used the no salt added beef broth and left out the extra salt. I omitted the zucchini...(not a big fan)...but added cheese tortellini...YUMMY!
This soup was quick and easy....and oh so delicious!
It's a perfect hearty meal with some crusty french bread.
Thank you Karen for an awesome, easy recipe!

Loved it!  I did tweak a few things like the others.  Added one more can broth and extra garlic.  Added no salt, it didn't need extra salt.  We loved it!  No clean up at all.  Fast, easy, will make again!  Thanks Karen!

We loved this soup!  My boyfriend says he could eat it once a week.  We used hot 'n' spicy Italian sausage, doubled the garlic and served it with crusty French bread.  Not only was it easy to prepare, but we only dirtied the stock pot, a cutting board and a couple of knives.  My kind of recipe!  THANK YOU!

I made this with chicken instead of sausage and my parents raved that it was better than Olive Garden's minestrone!  Very easy to throw together.  And healthy too!  This is the kind of stuff I crave.  Thanks, Karen!

This was wonderful! I did make a few changes though. I used sweet turkey sausage, 4 cups of beef broth, one can of diced tomato's and one can of tomato sauce, northern beans which I did drain because they are just too slimy for me undrained, no zucchini and definitely no spinach. I also added a half teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder, basil and about a half tablespoon of sugar to give it a little sweetness. Oh...and also a pinch of cayene for a little bit of heat. Just before serving I added about a 1/8 of a cooked cup of elbow macaroni to each day then topped with parmasan cheese and it was wonderful. I will definitely be making this one again! Thank you Karen :)

Oh.My.God.  This soup is sooooooooo good.  Very hearty and delicious.  I put a few extra things in, like some red wine and worchester and some extra herbs for added flavour.  I also added some onion and extra garlic.  My hubby loved it and I'm definitely putting this soup into heavy rotation for the winter. YUM!

I added a LOT more liquid to this recipe as it didn't make as much soup as we like, so I also upped some of the ingrediants.  Like everyone else said, it is much better the day after.  Next time I will be adding more meat and also more zucchini.

This is the first recipe I have tried. Wow! It is great soup! I added extra tomatoes, celery, and onions.  Added lentils instead of zucchini.  I used baby spinach and sliced thinly to avoid texture issues that were mentioned in other reviews.  My teenage daughter took this for lunch 3 days in a row!  I love this website!!!!

A wonderful, flavourful, hearty soup.  Unfortunately, I forgot to add the spinach, because I did mine in the crockpot, and figured I would add the spinach the last half hour of cooking, but ended up forgetting it altogether.  It was still delicious, and went wonderfully with the Unbelievable Rolls from this website.

Very good soup, comes together quickly and easily.  The timing for zucchini worked perfectly - it’s normally so easy for zucchini to become mushy, but not here. I added Parmesan rind with the stock and re over it at the end - adds depth of flavor and doesn’t dissolve.

Made a couple changes. Made this soup many times and it's a personal favourite! I sometimes sub potatoes and/or small pasta. Also I use chicken broth and a 28 oz can of diced Italian seasoned tomatoes. Works great.Thanks for a brilliant recipe. I will always make this!!

Made it a day in advance and the flavors were wonderful. My husband, who doesn’t think soup is dinner, said I can make this for dinner anytime. Very hearty!

With 3k 5-star reviews, mine is hardly needed, but this soup is absolutely amazing. I am not even normally a soup person. Use the listed recipe as a base and toss in some of whatever else you want. Extra beans? Some potato? Definitely delicious.

I love making this soup. I make exactly as written but omit the salt. If you use regular broth (not low sodium) the salt is not necessary IMO. Next time I’ll double the beans to hearty it up a bit.

Best soup ever. So popular in my house that I never have enough to take to work for friends. I add a VERY generous splash of red wine and I prefer to use chicken stock, but the recipe is so amazing it needs no changes. If you have a Romano or parmigiana-reggiano cheese rind it also adds depth.

Delicious - and so quick and easy to make! Caveat: I made this as written, but I substituted chicken broth for the beef, due to personal preference, and topped each bowl off with shredded parmesan - yum! The whole family loved it, even my 4-year-old.

Excellent, easy soup. I've made it several times. always good. Best advice - choose the sausage carefully for spicy quality that you desire.

I make this soup frequently and usually follow the recipe to the letter. My grocery doesn’t carry Italian style stewed tomatoes so I just add regular ones and upgrade spices. I add oregano. I’ve also used Swiss chard instead of spinach but any hearty leafy green works. Love love love this soup.

I have made this soup many times and it has become a family favorite. This last time, I threw in some fresh mushrooms at the same time as the zucchini and beans. I also love to pile on the spinach!! This soup is definitely going to be one I make for years to come!!

I have cooked the soup many times. There are 2 small changes that are very important to me. Drain the oil after cooking the sausage. Do not add salt. Everything in the soup has salt, so you don’t need to add any. I sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and that is perfect.

Have made this many times. I use fresh mild italian pork sausage from Whole Foods and squeeze it out of the casing before browning.  I also use fresh uncooked spinach in the bottom of each bowl so it wilts a bit after ladling the soup over it.  You can use various beans, veggies, and broths.  It always turns out great.

Absolutely fantastic!  Excellent flavor.  I added an onion to the sausage when browning.  I also added some oregano, but I excluded the salt and pepper as the broth was sufficiently salty.  Everyone loved this.  It will definitely be in my winter soup rotation.

I found this recipe 20 years ago in one of the recipe booklets at the check out stand at the grocery store.  I used to make it all the time.  The recipe book became tattered and stained and eventually disappeared.  I'm so glad I was able to find it again.  I used to make this with turkey Italian sausage which is a little more healthy.  This time I substituted the beef broth for veggie broth.  It was really good that way as well.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly using mild sausage and low sodium broth. With freezing temperatures outside and a house full of sick kids and adults this was a yummy change from the regular chicken noodle. Will be making again!

This soup is incredibly easy to throw together, but it tastes like a lot of work, with complex flavors that are divine together. The only think I would do next time is use fresh carrots and not canned. I might even add barley :) I am all about soups in the fall and winter, and this is going into my favs folder!

This was great, and my hubby loved it too--even the broth, which is unusual for him. I read a few reviews, and made the following changes:
* used two or three cloves garlic
* Added one diced potato at the same time as the carrots
* Skipped the salt
* Used a bag of frozen spinach instead of fresh, but microwaved it per the instructions on the bag, and added it in the last five minutes 
* cooked up 1 cup of ditalini pasta separately, and added it in the last five minutes
* Used a can of diced (instead of stewed) Italian tomatoes
* I only had one can of beef broth, so replaced one with 2 cups hot water and two cubes beef bouillon 
* added a can of chicken broth too

It was great, and it made a lot (perhaps due to my modifications). I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

Followed the recipe. The only thing I added was I took three large redskin potatoes sliced super thin with the skins on them and steamed in microwave then slowly added at the end.  Almost tastes like Zuppa Toscana from Olive Garden. Yum-O!

Great recipe!  

I've made this a couple of times.  As a result, I tweaked the recipe by adding freshly chopped parsley, basil and oregano.  I also added chopped yellow onion.  I used chicken broth instead of beef because that is what I usually have in the pantry.

I am making it for dinner tonight and decided to try it with about 1/4 cup of red wine, a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of the black pepper, and the addition of patty pan squash.

This is truly excellent!  I have never made a soup without onions and celery so I added those - broke up the stewed tomatoes a bit cause they were large, added extra garlic, and some fresh thyme, oregano &  parsley from our garden, a splash of worchestershire, some onion powder to add depth and a bit more broth - this was heart warming, excellent!  I didn't season with salt & pepper til more towards the end.  I also used baby spinach after i removed from heat.  My husband loved it too with crusty french baguette.  This is a keeper!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is! I usually use recipes as guidelines and then tweak as I feel appropriate, but this one does not need any tweaking. Family favorite in our house!

Fantastic! Really fast and easy to make with tons of flavor. I've made this soup twice now and modified it each time by adding more veggies like onion in the first step, celery in the second, and yellow squash in the third and lastly kale in the fourth. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I did not make any changes. I used Mild Italian sausage. It was really great. I have read the changes that other people have made, and some of them look interesting.

I have a soup contest at work every year and in the last few years I have won two soup contests with soups I got from alrecipes. This recipe was a winner this year,  I would definitely make it again.
 I definitely like it when I can review what other people have said and get their take on the recipe .

A friend introduced me to this recipe a few years ago, and I've made it a dozen times, since. A definite keeper. I always double the recipe but quadruple the carrots, zucchini and beans. Something else I recommend is instead of adding the spinach to the soup pot, I put fresh baby spinach leaves in each serving bowl, and ladle the hot soup on top. This way, everyone gets super-fresh, perfectly wilted spinach, especially the next day.

love this recipe.  Made it 100 times . . .I do always add in fresh basil, a dash of red pepper flakes, maybe a splash of whatever wine I'm drinking and quite a bit more garlic than the recipe calls for.  Yummy, low carb, low fat (if you substitute chicken Italian sausage).

This was delicious! I changed it up just a little. We are on diets so I used hot turkey sausage. I also added celery and onion and a pinch of red pepper flakes and used a can of san marzano tomatoes instead of stewed because we love them! It was incredible and will be making many more times!

I made this yesterday and followed the recipe as written.
It is/was very good. Left-overs are heating up right now. For a quick and easy soup, it has so much flavor. Simple to make and hits the spot!!! 
As with other recipes, you can do so many things with it to make it your own.

Came together really easily.  Used cannellini beans (rinsed) bc that's what I had on hand. And used unsalted chicken broth bc I prefer it to beef.

Subbed turkey Italian sausage for the pork. Added onion powder, basil, and Parmesan cheese. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Loved it! My husband is EXTREMELY health conscious and even he ate it and loved it.

Really great...everyone commented on it. I doubled the recipe, used half mild Italian and half hot Italian sausage. I used canelini beans. I made this the day before and refrigerated overnight,  which was good as I was able to scrape off the top layer of fat before reheating....it was very oily the night before. I added the spinach after reheating. I will make this again for sure!

What a great soup for anytime of year.  I used ingredients that I had on hand and tried to lighten it up a bit. I used turkey sausage instead of pork, cannelloni beans, chicken broth, and escarole soup instead of spinach. Delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

It is a 5 star Recipe the way it is originally. The only additions I did was double the garlic and add a chopped onion. If you like more of a liquid type of soup, you might want to add more water or broth. Otherwise, it is fine the way it is.

Excellent soup for guests - nice amount of vegetables and sausage. Everyone loved it. I would make it again as is, and you could also personalize with the vegetables you prefer. Some mention adding potatoes or noodles, but that would make it a little too goulash-like for me ( I love goulash - this is soup).  I'm looking forward to left-overs tonight!

Of all the recipes that I have made from this site this one truly lived up to it's rave reviews. My family devoured it! So easy to make and so good. I did double the recipe and I did make a few minor changes based on other reviewer's suggestions. I added a large chopped onion, extra garlic, an extra 2 cups of beef broth, 12oz of orzo and the saugage I used was 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet.  For my daughter who who does not want to "waste" her points on pasta I put her portion of the soup in another pot and added chopped cauliflower and chunks of mushrooms.  The cauliflower was her "pasta" and it absorbed the flavors beautifully.  While still eating the soup my family was asking me when I was going to make it again.  I guess that says it all!

Wow, this recipe is wonderful. The vegatables are a good mix and I used canned carrots and frozen zucchini instead of fresh because that was what I had available.  But the results  turned  out wonderful. The color is beautiful whereas you would be proud to serve on a winter night or any night with garlic bread. I will be making this again really soon.

I had had high hopes for this soup but neither my husband nor I loved it.  Not as much flavor as I was expecting given all the ingredients.  Won't make again :(

ok this was REALLY good! I did have to tweak the recipe to go along with what I had on hand.... so goes, sautéed onion, garlic and celery along with sweet Italian sausage. Used about 1/2 a container of beef broth. Used fresh spinach and 1 can of diced tomatoes. Had to use a pablano pepper up before it went bad, so threw that in to off set the sweetness of the Italian sausage. Threw in about 1/2 bag if cheese tortellini. Let it simmer till the biscuits were done.

Love this soup! This has become a winter staple in our house.  I add celery and onion in with carrots and sauté them all together before I brown the sausage. Absolutely delicious!!

Made it the first time using Apple sausage and the 2nd time with Italian Sausage. Delish both ways. Made it exactly as shown. Sprinkled parmesan cheese when serving.

Absolutely Wonderful!!! I had to use squash instead of zucchini because the store didn't have any but I don't believe it made any difference. I also added two medium potatoes cubed because I like them in soups, makes it a bit more hearty. Other than that, I would suggest 3 cups of spinach. Thank you for sharing!!!

Very good soup. I wanted to drain fat from sausage first because I used pork sausage so made small sausage balls first and pan fried and drained on a paper towel. Also I didn't have spinach and substituted thinly sliced kale instead and so put that in with the zucchini as it has to cook longer than spinach. I shared 1/2 soup with a neighbor taking care of an ailing husband and she raved about it too. Thanks Sally.

First time making this tonight. I left out the beans (they don't like me). I did add a chopped onion and cooked macaroni pasta. Used low sodium and no MSG beef broth. Everything else besides the salt was the same. Before adding the 3 cups of cooked macaroni, it seems like there wasn't enough broth. But I ended up adding macaroni instead. That soaked up all the broth. After it was made, I added a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. It was a nice and hearty so called soup. My husband and I liked it, however my son wouldn't touch it. He didn't like the look nor the veggies. If I do make this next time, more broth, less pasta.

Oh my word! This is my new favorite recipe!  I basically doubled the recipe and added chopped celery and onions. I used 2 cans of beef broth and 2 of chicken broth. I also used sweet and hot Italian sausage. Some of the sausage I rolled in small balls, the rest I crumbled. I also used about a cup of cubed potatoes and a cup of spiral noodles. Mainly for the kids. You can definetly make this recipe your own.

Wonderful recipe! This soup tastes better the second day. I change a few things, add sauteed onion, and a can of black beans with the Northern beans, and turkey breakfast sausage. I also omit the zucchini since my husband does not like it. I never measure the spinach and let it wilt in the soup. I also top this soup with some shredded Monterrey Jack cheese to serve and it melts and makes for a delicious topping. This is our favorite soup!

A great base but definitely needs more seasoning beyond the salt and pepper.  I used Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute - about a Tablespoon.

I used this recipe more as a building block for my own soup there was so many changes. I'm sure this soup is good as it stands, but the inspiration it gave me made it the final product very delicious. I added one large potato, diced and cooked it in olive oil for about ten minutes with sausage (not ground, summer/kielbasi style) that was also diced. While that was cooking I made the beef broth, added the garlic, some basil, ground coriander, oregano and black pepper. Once the seasonings were added I cut up the stewed tomato's and put them in, followed by the sausage and potato's. Cooked at a slight boil covered for about an hour, added the beans and spinach, cooked for another 15-20 minutes and served it with bread. It, was, amazing and my company loved it. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is fantastic. Although I modified it a little, it came out terrific.  I used bow tie pasta instead of the beans and fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Super easy to make.  This will be a definite repeat for my dinner menu

Awesome! Although I did change it up a bit. I used a bit of butter to sauté green onion, celery, garlic and mushrooms then added mild Italian sausage and browned it in the same pan. Next I added a can of diced tomatoes, a tablespoon of tomato paste, a drained can of white beans, carrots, zucchini, a bag of fresh spinach and a large carton of low sodium chicken broth. Seasoned with black pepper and a few red peppers flakes and let it cook until veggies were tender. Before serving I added pasta and let it cook. Yummy!

Wow. This is incredible. Per other reviewer suggestions, I added an extra can of beef broth and an extra clove of garlic. Once I put the soup in a bowl, I added grated Parmesan and a scoop of couscous  (HIGHLY recommend!! They gave it an incredible added flavor and texture). I will be making this very often. Wonderful recipe!!

Excellent!  Olive Garden makes a similar recipe with sausage, potatoes and kale. This recipe is much better. Only change I made was to add a little extra beef broth and rinsed the beans. Rinsing canned beans removes a lot of the extra sodium. Served with fresh loaf of French bread.

I’ve made this soup many times now and it remains a favorite of ours!  I usually double the recipe and freeze half for later.  Ditilini makes a nice addition but I’ve found that it’s better to cook it separately and add to the bowls before serving, otherwise it over cooks. Thanks for this great soup recipe!

This soup is amazing!  I never change a thing when I first try a recipe.  This is absolutely PERFECT without a single adjustment.  Served it with garlic pull-apart bread.  YUM!  Also made Baked Ziti I,which is excellent, but I won't serve these two dishes together again as the soup usurped the Ziti's place as the star of the dinner table.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Made this with a few changes as well according to our taste and the reviews. Added chopped fresh parsley to taste, 1cup of orzo noodles, deleted the carrots and potatoes and used chicken broth instead of beef. It was absolutely delicious and easy!!

The most finicky bunch of eaters (my family) loved this soup! I have been told to put it into the rotation, and to make it exactly the same way.  I modified two things: I used 2 hot and 3 sweet italian sausages as others suggested. Also,  I degreased the sausages after frying them  (put them into a paper towel lined sieve) and I did not add any salt or pepper. Other than that, I followed the recipe as printed. 

After working all day its a real treat to make a soup this good in under one hour.  Add a nice stick of French bread or the like and viola! - dinner is served!

We found this and decided to give it a try!! Boy are we glad we did!! The only thing different we did, was fry the meat separate, used 2x the amount of garlic, and added the meat and drippings to the stock pot. We omitted the Northern Beans, and opted for a half a bag of wide egg noodles. This is a KEEPER!! My husband and I both loved it, and the kids went back for a second bowl. Thanks so much for posting such a wonderful recipe that my family will enjoy for years!!

This was delicious! Very easy to make.  Matter of fact, I am eating it now. I made some slight changes to the recipe. I added an onion, 2 cans of Italian style stewed tomatoes, and I use 32 ounces of low sodium beef broth. I had some squash in the refrigerator and I threw that in as well. I didn't have any spinach, but had Swiss Chard, so I used that instead. I know some people included rice or pasta, but I am watching my carbs. I also did't add salt or include the juice from the beans since I am watching my sodium. At the end it tasted great with the Swiss Chard and I added a little bit of grated Parmesan cheese.

I really liked this, but hubs and daughter allowed me to eat the leftovers alone. Maybe a little too spicy for them; will try to tone it down next time, perhaps with regular sausage.

Excellent soup!  I added cheese tortelli at the end as well and used fresh kale instead of spinach adding with the carrots.  Great with parm cheese and crusty bread.

I made this last night and OH MY!  This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exact, except I used stock instead of broth and omitted the salt. My guy who does not like beans at all finished his bowl and had seconds!  I am not a fan of cooked spinach, but will tolerate it every now and then.  The ingredient portions for us were spot on as nothing overwhelmed.  Great balanced flavor!

One of the easiest and tastiest soups I've ever made. The few changes I made were: sauteed 1 diced onion with the garlic and sausage; added extra garlic; added 1/2 tsp Italian Seasonings; added an extra can of broth; and added 1/4 cup of dried orzo 10 min before soup was done. Delish and so pretty.

I made this, tweaking it to suit our preferences, and it was pretty good.  I used all hot Italian sausage, an extra can of beef broth, and diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano added.  I also added a generous cup of both diced onions and celery.  I do think this recipe lacks sufficient seasoning, so I may have to doctor my leftovers with some Italian seasoning to help boost the favor.

This is a yummy soup.  I generally cook the sausage without the garlic and then rinse it a little and omit the salt so it isn't too salty - salt can be added at the table if necessary.  After I rinse the sausage I add the garlic & carrots (I also add onion and celery) and let that cook for a bit before adding the broth and tomatoes.  I also like to serve it with about a tablespoon of fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  YUM!

My husband doesn't like Zucchini, so we omit it. The rest is just amazing. It is so simple, yet so delicious. We make it at least once a month.  I do double or triple the garlic, as I do with most recipes.

I have made this soup half a dozen times and I love everything about it.
In fact, when I found a jar of frozen soup in my freezer I immediately pulled it to take to work and I'm eating it now. 
I use all hot sausage and it just makes it taste amazing. Now I'm planning to invest in a dozen half pint jars so I can have frozen soup small enough to fit in the work microwave.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made!  It was easy and delicious.  I think the sausage flavoring is what really makes it so good.  I used fresh ground chicken sausage from my grocer's meat department and I also added extra veggies that I had on hand (diced onion, pureed sweet potato and green beans).  My husband also thought this was one of the best soups I've made.  Keeper!

This soup deserves 10 stars!  Delish!  Followed recipe to a T except used red chard in place of spinach as I had to use it up.  Would be just as good with spinach I am sure.  Definitely going into the regular rotation.  Also may play with it a bit and add some onion to see what it does.  At least I know it's great as written.  Thanks for a wonderful (and easy!) recipe!

I was leary about this recipe because I don't like sausage much, but my husband does, so really I was making this for him.  Wow, I love it too! It is now one of my favourites that I will make over and over.

This soup was very tasty.  I give it 5 stars.  Boyfriend gave it 4.  I added 3 cans of beef broth, used 2 cloves of garlic and added an additional 1/2 chopped fresh tomato in addition to the stewed tomatoes.  I used 1/2 pack of frozen spinach and added some pasta as well.  Although I loved this soup, to make it a little healthier, I think 1/2 the sausage would be just fine because there's an abundance of sausage and sausage flavor.
1/7/2020:  Made again with 1/2 of the sausage and string beans instead of zucchini; followed exactly otherwise.  We both loved it.

GREAT! I added a diced potato, celery, mushrooms, and a cup of onion. Next time I'm going to add an extra can of tomatoes, more carrots, potatoes and mushrooms. Parmesan cheese really made this taste significantly better.

Very good and satisfying soup! I made it exactly as the recipe reads except I drained the beans and used some fresh kale and SPICY Italian sausage - The spicy sausage added a nice kick. I removed the meat from the casings of 2 sausages and browned it in my dutch oven then added the rest of the ingredients. I had to cook the soup a while longer to tenderize the kale, so I had to add more water and some bouillon granules.

This was perfect for a cold March night! I added 2x the stewed tomatoes,  1/2 an onion, and 4 big leaves of dinosaur kale, and replaced the italian sausage with spicy sausage. I also didn't add salt or pepper and served over rice. It was AMAZING!! That's the beauty of soup. You really can't do wrong.

Wonderful!  We've made it 3-4 times and it's great every time.  I've used frozen zucchini, left out the spinach, used plain old canned tomatoes and it was still great.  I would recommend that you season to taste after it's cooked awhile and don't be afraid to add more garlic and salt.  I used the bottled chopped garlic and I probably use a heaping tablespoon in this recipe.

I do not think that there is any way to mess up this soup.  I made it on a Sunday for Monday night's dinner and it never made it past Sunday night.  Then I made it again on Monday after I got home from work.  The second time around I had to use what I had on hand which meant kidney beans, carrots, sweet red pepper, spicy diced tomato, corn, escarole, some leftover rice, etc (along with hot Italian sausage). 
  And it was excellent. Do not add salt, it really does not need it.  A little extra garlic and it really tastes great.  Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful!!  I prefer using spicy Italian sausage and slicing it thin, then sautéing. I also use frozen spinach and toss it in at the end without defrosting. Everything is hot within minutes.
Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe with a few changes based on preference and items on hand and it was AWESOME. I read some reviews and adjusted accordingly.
-1lb Hot italian sausage
-2 cloves garlic
-1 med. sweet onion
-1 big baking potato, cubed
-2 cans diced tomatoes (1 petite, 1 italian flavored)
-24ish oz beef broth
-1cup julienned carrots
-wilted in about 2cups frozen spinach after removing from heat

I did this all in the dutch oven and subbed the potato because my husband does not like beans, and left out the zucchini because I had forgotten to buy some. Other than that, this was a WONDERFUL soup and didnt require any additional seasoning (besides some pepper) because the sausage did that all on it's own. I toasted up some ciabatta bread to go with it but it was perfect all on it's own. For my daughters, I added some pre-made wheat elbows to give it more substance, and I bet adding some sort of pasta in it would be good too. definitely a make-again!

I've been making this soup since seeing it in the allrecipes cookbook back in 2005. I usually double the recipe because everyone in my family LOVES this soup, plus I want plenty of leftovers. I never have measured the spinach when I make it - I always just use 2 bags (since I double the recipe) of fresh baby spinach. It seems like a lot but it's soooooo good! I'll serve this with some kind of hard roll, so you can get up all the juice from this delicious soup! It's not my recipe, but my family considers it one of my soup recipes since I make it so much! Definitely recommend it to EVERYONE!!!

I have made this recipe many times and love it. This recipe really is great all by itself without any changes, but I like to make just a couple modifications to make it more kid friendly. I do add (already cooked) bow tie pasta and sprinkle the filled bowls with Parmesan so it is more appealing for my kids.  With the addition of the pasta, I add a few more ounces of beef broth. Even though I cook the pasta prior to adding it to the soup, I'm sure it still sucks up some of the broth.  Also, I prefer pinto beans in general over Northern beans, so I do substitute those.

Love this recipe! We like lots of spice in our soup, so I added Italian seasoning to taste, more broth, and cheese tortellini. I also added diced onions while browning the sausage. Yum!

Absolutely wonderful flavor. Wow, so simple yet so delicious. I have a sausage shop close by that makes great sausage, that probably helps. Also used up the last of the homemade turkey stock from Thanksgiving instead of beef broth. Otherwise stuck to the recipe. You need to try this, and read some of the suggestions as you'll want to make this over and over.

going to try this recipe tonight.  Question: do you remove the casing from the sausage and break it up when you cook it or cook it whole with the casing and then chop it?
thanks!

This soup was really easy to make and very delicious! So versatile to customize it the way you like with different veggies although I liked it the way it was with the exception of adding onion and cooked ditalini pasta. Tnis one is a keeper and perfect for the winter months ahead! Two thumbs up!

Made this yesterday.  I was amazed that the simple ingredients came together to form such a beautiful, tasty soup.  I only added 1 cup of couscous to the original recipe to fill in.  For broth, I had partial boxes of both beef and chicken, so I used all I had, about three cans worth, probably.  The family voted this a keeper worth a repeat.  I was hoping to have a bowl for breakfast today, but they wiped it out last night.  Thank you for the easy, great soup recipe!

Every member of my family loves this soup. I served it to a large group recently and any time I see one of my guests they mention how they loved this soup. I have never served a meal before that EVERYBODY loves. This is it!! The only change I made was I added a small amount of cooked pasta(ditalini),1/2 cup dry. I also offer Parmesan cheese for the top of soup.

I made this this morning for two good friends who are not feeling well, for lunch on a cold day and for them to freeze the leftovers.  Served with crusty baguette and assorted cheeses.  Maybe it was the reheating or the company but it was very, very good.  I will make it again soon for just us.  By popular request I will increase the baby spinach to 1 1/2 bags, already doubled the garlic.  Luckily one of our local stores carries bulk mild sausage so I won't have to strip it out of the casings.  One of the reasons for winter is great soups like this!

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I added a chopped onion when I added the garlic; added a chopped potato with the carrots;and a couple ounces of cut spaghetti ten minutes before done (orzo is another option. Had to add an extra cup of stock due to the pasta. I also flavored with oregano. Anyway you fix it, serve with grated parmesan cheese.

I made some changes, omitted the beans & added a pound of small pasta. I also seasoned it with a packet of salad/veggie seasoning and made a chicken broth instead of the beef (from a powder packet). I used frozen spinach instead of fresh and finally added cornstarch as needed to thicken it up. It made a TON so I froze the leftovers. AWESOME!

We absolutely love this soup.  I make it exactly as written except that I add gnocchi (the mini ones are best, but the regular ones work well, too).  It makes a meal!

Amazing. Every time I make this recipe I change the ingredients just a little. I added corn and green peppers to the ingredients this time, used andouille instead of italian sausage, followed a review to throw it all in a crock pot after browning the sausage/garlic and voila! It turned out incredible. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

This soup is delicious!  My husband and children love it, as do I.  I like to add ditalini and I use ground Italian sausage.  This soup tastes even better the following day (that doesn't happen often because my husband goes back for 3rds everything I make this).

Even my 3 year old non veggie eater gobbled it up.  Of course we told him the tomatoes were canalope and the zuchini (we used yellow squash because the store was out) was candy corn.

This is the tastiest and easiest soup in my repertoire.  My husband usually doesn't think soup is a meal, but this one passes his approval and my kids ask for it every week.  Leftovers go into the thermos for lunches the next day.

This is soooooo delicious!  The only change I made was using small pasta instead of the beans and I cooked the pasta in a different pot and added it to each bowl just so it wouldn't get overcooked when reheated the next day.  Since it's only my husband and I, we eat it for dinner and then for lunch and then for dinner again and we don't mind one bit;)

DELICIOUS. This soup is really easy and filled with flavor. I will be making this plenty more times. What i did different: I used 1 can of beef broth and 1 can of chicken, i used navy beans instead of northern beans, and i used kale instead of spinach. Fantastic

Very tasty & so comforting on a chilly evening! Made pretty close to directions: Used 2/3 sweet & 1/3 hot Italian sausage, subbed chayote for zucchini & orzo for beans (only cuz they were on hand) & sauteed 1/2 chopped onion w/ the sausage & garlic, which I then drained all the grease from. NO NEED to add salt & pepper due to the sausage. Also, I felt it needed more liquid & added 2 cans chicken broth (again, that's what I had & btw, all broths were low sodium). So even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly believe the base of it warrents 5 stars. With crusty french bread to sop up all the yummy broth this pot of soup easily fed 8.

Always a winner.  I use kale instead of spinach for an extra punch of nurtrients and flavour.  Otherwise, this recipe is perfect the way it is.

Very easy to make--Soup broth (?) has a good flavor. I used the ground sweet italian sausage breaking it down somewhat into tiny pieces, chopped the stewed tomatoes up until almost a puree and added to the broth, drained the beans and substituted 1/2 cup water in its place. Added 'acini de pepe' noodles (tiny dots) for the 'Italian' in me -- next time I make, I want to add some peas. Perfect on a spur-of-the-moment winter night.

Outstanding!   Taste and texture is amazing. Very clean flavors. Only change was I added an onion and more garlic, and used frozen spinach.  Eating it now for the  second day and boy does it hit the spot on a cold day. Thanks for a great recipe.

I left out the carrots and beans because I was trying to cut back some of the carbs and it was still good.  My husband couldn't get enough of it.

I made this for the 1st time this past weekend for some friends and it turned out very good. They all loved it. 

The only thing i changed, based on other reviews, was i added a 3rd can of beef broth.

I'll definitely be making this again.

Really good!  Used turkey Italian sausage, 2 cans of tomatoes instead of one, chickpeas because that's what I had in my cabinet, frozen spinach and a cup of quinoa to thicken.  Wow!  Easy and delicious!

This soup was good, but just not a home run for me.  It is very easy to prepare and my family enjoyed it.  It just didn't WOW us.

This recipe is definitely worth all of the 5 star reviews... It's Delicious! I followed the basic recipe but made some exceptions. I left out the zucchini (don't care for it) and added chopped onions and chick peas. I also added garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and worcestershire sauce to taste and a little bit of whole grain rotini to make it more hearty.

Everyone raved! This will definitely be a staple in my home from now on. 

P.S. I've already shared this recipe with my mom and she will soon be making it as well. I have no doubts that she will love it. 
Thanks!

DELICIOUS!! A made a couple of changes to suit our tastes. I sauted 1 finely chopped onion with 2 pounds of ground italian sausage and added a couple quick shakes of garlic powder. To the soup I added 1 diced potato and a couple pinches of fresh chopped rosemary. Based on other reviews I used 2 cans of low sodium beef broth. Everyone loved it, perfect soup for a cold night. YUM!

I love these kinds of recipes because they allow you to mold things to your liking.  I had leftover sausage from making a pizza, so this was perfect.  If you like it spicy go for hot sausage but I think sweet Italian sausage is so much better.  Also, I use buillon instead of broth so I just add equivalent amounts of water and cubes, I had no Italian style tomatoes so I used regular but next time I will probably add oregano and basil to the soup to make up for it, used bell pepper instead of zucchini since its what I had on hand and frozen spinach instead of fresh.  As long as you use appropriate amounts of liquid, you can do whatever you want with these and it will be wonderful. That's the beauty of these.  Small pasta would probably be great with this too.  Wonderful soup, a definite keeper and a good base for all kinds of new ideas!

I think this was a great recipe.  Easy to make and a very hearty soup. Becareful not to add too much pasta, it soaks up a lot of the broth!  I used sweet sausage because I like the flavor of sweet better and then added some redpepper flakes for a kick.

Full of flavor and easy to make.  Thank You! I like that you don't have to stand over the stove for a long time and instead can let it simmer while you work on something else.

Delicious!  My family loves soup, and I was looking for something new.  I don't think I would have picked this to make based on the recipe--it sounds a little odd.  But, after reading the raving reviews, I HAD to try it, and we loved it!  I have made it twice, once with italian sausage, and once w/turkey sausage & added italian seasoning.  Both were excellent.  I used 3-4 cans chicken broth instead of beef, 1/2 package frozen spinach instead of fresh, and extra garlic.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Oh, I also put some small pasta in at the end, but found it got mushy after sitting-- so the second time I cooked dilantini separately, and added it to each bowl of soup--that way even leftovers were perfect!  Yum!

I had never had a soup with Italian sausage before so tried this one. The arroma was intoxicating and color a real eye pleaser. I couldn't wait for my hubby to get home for lunch so I had a very small bowl. Then 15 minutes later, another. When he got home we both had a large bowl and he asked how long it would take to make another pot of the soup because he wanted it for dinner as well. We have never had a soup so good that we craved it. Have had it four times this month already. Thank you so much for our new favorite soup. Made it as written the first time. Added 1/2 very small onion and extra cup of broth the second time just to stretch it another bowl.

Maybe this is a 5 * as far as Italian Soups go but as just a soup, our entire family thought it was OK.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  Probably wil not make again.

This is a totally awesome soup. Very filling, and tasty. We substituted chicken broth for the beef and added a can of corn.  BOOM.  It was good.  The spinach makes it super filling for a soup.

I hate to rate a recipe I've altered but this is a good base.  I added onion, celery, greenbeans,while browning the sausage.   Small shell pasta, kidney beans instead of great Northern, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp oregano.  Everything else stayed the same.

This is a simple and delicious go to soup. I took one of the suggestions and added small shell pasta. It kind of tastes like a REALLY good minestrone, but with sausage. It's very flavorful and stores well.

This is a great basic recipe that can be customized with whatever you have on hand. I made it with a mix of hot & sweet Italian sausage that I removed from the casings and browned. I used black beans because that's what I had. I made this more like a "stoup" -- a little thicker than a soup, thinner than a stew -- and mixed in a bag of Success brown rice just before serving. Family loved it!

AMAZING!!! One reviewer remarked that this recipe has alot of "wiggle room"...perfectly put. My amendments were: ground pork in place of sausage, used up the left over spaghetti sauce, added mushrooms, pinto beans, sweet red peppers, diced onions, and whole wheat pasta. We added a sprinkle of parmesan for garnish. We are huge soup fans and will be eating this ALOT.  Over 20,000 people have saved this recipe to their recipe box...ALL of them will be glad they did!!!

This was really good! I had some leftover sweet italian sausages & was looking for a diffrent way to use them up then the way we always have them. I will admit I was a little hesitant making this as its not at all something I would normally make but I've been in the soup mode lately since its getting chilly out & with all the good reviews I had to try it out. I changed the recipe around a bit based on other reviewers suggestions & my own personal taste. I used 2 can's of chicken broth because thats what I had on hand. I also added to equal amounts of water to cut the salt down. I also left the added salt out it didn't need it. I used 3 cloves of garlic cause I love it!! And instead of zuccini & spinach I used mushrooms & potatoes. It was delish! I had it again for lunch today & it had even more flavor today!! Great easy & quick soup to throw together for a weeknight meal :)

Great soup! As written, it's more stew-like than soupy, and I ended up adding another can of broth like other reviewers mentioned. I also added an extra small can of tomatoes with chiles for some added spice that my family likes. Don't leave out the spinach - it makes what would be a good soup a great one.

I made this using only the ingredients stated in the recipe except I sprinkled grated Romano cheese on top of each bowl.  I did not measure any of the ingredients.  The soup is excellent as is with no changes needed.  I had a friend who loves to cook over for lunch and he asked for the recipe, first time ever.  I used low sodium beef broth, tomatoes, and I rinsed the beans.  I wanted to be able to control how much salt was in the soup.  Easy and Excellent!!!!  I’m sending this recipe to my son, sister, brothers and my 81 year old dad.  They will love it too.  Enjoy!!!!

I made this for the first time and it turned out great.  Followed others advise and used 2 hot and 3 sweet sausages.  No salt needed, it's salty enough.

I was so excited to try this soup. We are HUGE soup eaters but I was really disappointed with this recipe. The flavoring came mainly from the saugage which was disappointing. I think their are better soups out there.

I felt like this lacked flavor but it was a good base recipe that I could add spices to.  I added chopped broccoli instead of chopped spinach on accident.  Oops.

Everyone agreed -- this is an excellent soup!  Per other reviews, I added pasta, extra broth, extra garlic, and some basil/oregano. I also used hot Italian sausage, since that's what we prefer. Thank you for the great recipe!!

I didn't have any zucchini so I used sweet peppers instead...didn't have garlic, so used a bit of garlic salt and omitted the regular salt..didn't have northern beans but cannelini worked nicely. It still was delicious. I used sweet italian sausage. My son LOVED it and he is my barometer for recipes. I will definitely make this again.

This was ok. I probably won't make it again, as it was just mostly ok. It wound up tasting (to me) like tomato vegetable soup, only without enough tomato. The sausage was a nice addition and it lends me to thinking of adding sausage to my favorite tomato veggie soup, and I really liked incorporating spinach into the soup too. Thank you for the wonderful jumping-off point!

This soup has become a regular at our house.  I make it just as the recipe states and it's fabulous!  Leftovers are just as good as fresh from the pot.  Bake some homemade bread and you're all set!

This soup was delicious. My husband and I both tend to load our food up with spices, and I worried that this would not be flavorful enough. We used hot Italian sausage, though (and low sodium broth), and neither of us felt like the soup was wanting for anything. I will definitely make it again!

I really am not a fan of broth-based sopups although I will prepare them but this soup has completely changed my mind. It blows my mind how simple amd delicious it is. I used "Johnson's mild Italian sausage" and oh so yummy!!! I also upped the garlic added a sweet onion, increased the broth to about 2 L, doubled the tomatoes and also added about 1/2 TBSP of italian spices. My hubby thought it was great also. With my changes this soup will feed many many people I have tons of leftovers in the fridge and also froze some. I think I'm going to try adding some kind of starch next time. Thanx for sharing such an amazing recipe!!

This was an awesome soup!  I used Italian Turkey sausage because I'm always looking for ways to lighten up recipes. I also added an onion when sausage partially browned and upped the garlic to 3 cloves and added some oregano with beef broth, etc.  Really good, will make it again.

This was a great soup. I loved it, my husband loved it. I made a few additions to the recipe. I added black beans and cannelli beans with the great northern beans and I added orzo too. Also added kale with the spinach. A little extra garlic didn't hurt. Will make this many more times. It was fantastic.

I make often and use 6-10 oz bag of fresh spinach and liked it better. I also added a can of diced Italian tomatoes, because we like tomatoes. This soup is great as is!

I love soup and this is one of my new favorites. The sausage gives it so much flavor. I used 3 sweet and 2 hot sausages and I added a 14 oz can of chicken broth. I also used a package of frozen spinach in place of the fresh. I added some pearl couscous, which was great, but I wouldn't do that again because it become mushy when I froze it. This was a great heart warming soup. Thanks for the recipe!

hmmm...this was just okay for me.  I made this in a crock pot and used turkey sausage to cut down on the fat.  Was okay but not sure that I'd make it again.....

This was so easy to make and tasted great.  The only thing I did differently was to cook the sausage and then put it all in a slow cooker for 6 hours.

Amazing. I didn't have stewed tomatoes or great northern beans so I used diced tomatoes and roman beans. Also used frozen spinach and pasta shells. Both my kids 3 and 1 gobbled this up. My 3yr old said I can make this again anytime!!!!

I was pleasantly surprised with this soup. When I told my hubby I was making Italian sausage soup his response was "YUCK"... Let me tell you, when he tasted it ,he LOVED it. The soup is very tasty w/out alot of added spices. I used HOT Italian sausage and the soup had just a little kick to it. It was truly a fabulous soup and much bettre than I thought it would be. I am adding this to my recipe box as a favorite soup. ENJOY!!!

Wow, I thought I deleted/misplaced this recipe!!! The troops would have revolted! Phew! now everything is great because, since last year when I started making this soup, it has become one of the top 3 winter favorites and top 10 year round soups to have.  What a GREAT SOUP!

This soup is AWESOME.  I've made it several times for several occasions and everyone has raved about it.  I keep several copies of the recipe on hand because it never fails - several people always ask for the recipe.

Great soup.... it's nice to have on winter days... Only thing that concerned me when making it is that it seemed a bit oily.  When preparing next time I'll be sure to drain the sausage a little better.
Thanks!

This is awesome soup.  I am not a great cook and tried this and it came out perfect.  I used a frozen spinach box, as suggested by others and it was great. Full of flavor and easy!  It was even better the next few days!  I am making a batch for a party this weekend.  Can't wait!!

Very yummy and fast to make, what a combo!  I used low sodium beef broth and left out the salt.  I also used frozen chopped spinach that I thawed before using. So much easier!  This made a great meal!

Terrific! I substituted half pound of Italian Turkey Sausage from Perdue and cut the beans in half. It staid within the WW points I allow for dinner. (Can't give points in this forum but let's just say I cut them by more than half.)

oh so good!!! If you want to make this lower fat without losing the flavor I suggest buying the turkey breakfast sausage and just adding a teaspoon of fennel seed to give it that italian sausage taste without the fat! If you like a little spice put 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper. I also used frozen spinach. You can put fun shaped pasta with a little extra broth or water so they kids will not turn their nose up.

This is the best soup I have ever had! It was really easy to make, too. I added a potato. I put the zucchini in with the other vegetables and then let it simmer as directed. Instead of the cans of beef broth, I just used 4 cups of water and 4 beef boulion squares. After 15 minutes, I added the beans and spinnach and covered for 5 minutes. Adding the zucchini early and skipping the additional 15 minute simmer did not make a difference in the soups taste. I will definetly be making this many times this winter! Thankyou!

I have been using allrecipes for years and this is the first recipe I've felt compelled to comment on- absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding some extra garlic and using frozen, drained spinach.  So great to come home from work to!  Thank you for the recipe!

i am not a huge soup fan but decided to give it a try after having a similar recipe at a friends house.  im so glad i did, the soup was really really good.  i followed the recipe exactly and i probably wouldnt change a thing.  it was pretty salty but to change that buy low sodium beans or broth.

This soup was really good!  My husband is not a soup person...but he raved over this recipe.  I couldn't find Great Northern Beans, so I substituted with navy beans and it worked well.  Thank you for warming us up with this hot soup.

This might be my fav soup ever!!  I used 1lb mild italian sausage, the beef broth plus a box of chicken broth, 1T oregano, doubled the garlic, added about 1c pasta (uncooked, while simmering), used frozen spinach, and garnished with fresh parmesan before serving.  IT IS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  DH said the only thing he'd change is he would use fresh kale or something like that for the greens.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

OUTSTANDING.  I tend not to measure ingredients to closely when making something like soup but here are the things I did definitely based on other reviews: i used 5 hot sausages and 3 sweet which I sauteed with garlic and oil, I used 5 cans of chicken broth, a big can of diced tomatoes, celery, 2 cans of beans, no add'l salt, I forgot the spinach, ops, a bag of sweet corn.  I also cooked a box of Barilla Plus elbows which we added as we served the soup.  This soup is as good as all the reviewers say!  Thanks.

Delicious. I would recommend draining the fat from the sausage and pan before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.  Without doing this I found the soup to be too greasy. Like others, I add a hearty, small-shaped pasta.  Cooking the pasta separately and adding it directly to your bowl, avoids making the soup too chunky as the pasta soaks up the broth.  I also use 4 cups of broth when using pasta.

This is such a great base recipe. So much can be done with it and it still comes out really good! I make this soup often during the winter.  I usually follow the suggestion of using 3 hot sausages and 2 mild ones but often times its just a matter of what I have in the house. You can throw additional veggies in, or extra beans - whatever your preference.   I also like to put some rotini in at the end.  This soup is impossible to screw up.

This recipe is so forgiving; basically, all you need is Italian sausage + some kind of broth + any vegetables you have in the house. Wonderful. We used Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage with fresh herbs. So good.

Awesome! Used reduced sodium beef broth, sausage has enough soodium in it without adding more. Little leftover for family of 5.

This recipe is one of my favorite soups.  There are lots of tastes and textures and it sticks to the ribs!  It tastes great as is, no modifications are necessary.  I accidently picked up hot sausage instead once and it added a nice kick to it.

Wonderful and perfect for a cold, Winter night!  Instead of stewed tomatoes, I added can of diced tomatoes with chili (medium hot). Instead of fresh spinach, used frozen. Instead of beef broth, used low sodium chicken broth. Instead of zucchini, I added small elbow macaroni. After cooking sausage, drained fat and dried off sausage with paper towel to soak up as much grease as possible. Topped off with a little freshly grated Padano Parmesan and Romano cheeses. This is a soup I will be making again and again.  Thanks Karen!

Amazing. My husband raved about it for days. Easy to make and very tasty. Only thing we substituted was canned diced tomatos for fresh as it saved time preparing.

I followed the recipe except I added two cans of stewed tomatoes instead of one and a half cup of chopped vidalia onion and cooked it with the sausage. I cooked a cup of Orzo pasta seperately and added it when the soup was complete. It was the best soup I have ever made which doesn't mean anything since all my others were named campbells. It was really good. Will definately make again.

Excellent soup....and so easy!!!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, only I made it easy on myself.....I used pre-minced garlic, bought pre-shredded carrots and a bag of pre-washed baby spinach which I tore into smaller pieces!  It was fantastic!!!  This is a meal I will keep on my list to bring to someone when recovering from an illness!

I made this today to take to lunch for the week. I followed the recipe posted, but added a cup of sauteed leeks. I omitted the salt and used low sodium beef broth. It was excellent today, probably be even better tomorrow.

This recipe is fabulous, the only thing I did different was add noodles.  I would suggest doubling the recipe and adding a small noodle such as ditalini or small shells, otherwise it is easy and wonderful!

This soup was easy to make and delicious. You can change it up a little and use this as your base recipe, as other reviewers have done. I added basil ansd oregano and used fresh spinach. I added carrots, and since I didn't have the white beans I added some sheese tortellini pasta instead. I also used extra broth and canned tomatoes. Thank you for the recipe!!

This recipe was great- I used one lg. zucchini instead of 2 small, and I rolled the italian sausage into 1/2" balls- picky 2 & 5 year old girls will not eat sausage but had no problem eating meatballs :-)
We love this wintery soup!!!

Wonderful, company worthy, a real find and even pretty with the rich spinach color.  Great as is but will try with chicken, onions, etc as suggested.  Amazing flavor with common ingredients - tastes like hours of work.  THANK YOU!

Good, (not great) soup. My girlfriend found it was good for her sinus cold,(spicy sausage??).
Got 1/2 mild and 1/2 spicy Italian sausage.  Unfamiliar with "Great Northern" beans, used Orzo pasta instead. Overall, filling, hearty winter soup. Would recommend to others.

This is definately a keeper!  It is easy, hearty, and except for the sausage and sodium, healthy soup.  I suggest not adding the salt.  I did not add it and used reduced sodium broth - it was plenty salty.  Might be good with a turkey sausage to make it healthier...thanks very much for sharing - I am adding it to the family favorites!

I found this recipe to be exceptional. I followed the recipe and was very pleased with the results. I recommend that everyone read the reviews, but unless there is an overwhelming objection to the recipe, follow exactly the first time. Then modify if you feel it is necessary.

Outstanding Soup! I followed the previous persons suggestions by adding: 1 can of chicken broth to the mix
2 diced red potatoes
1 cup of orzo pasta
and I did 1/2 lb of sweet italian sausage and 1/2 spicy italian sausage
I used fresh spinach and did not add salt.

Great recipe, thanks so much for posting it and sharing the additions to it.

This definetely is a hearty soup.  As always, I adjusted the recipe a bit.  I bought the beans but when I opened the can they smelled so horrible that I decided not to use them.  I doubled the zucchini, added 2 tbsp. of fresh basil and 1/2 cup of chopped onion.  My husband was so full off of one bowl that he didn't have room for seconds!  We will absolutely be making this again.

Wow, I have tried many recipes and never felt the drive to leave feedback but this one deserves it! It is simple, fast, healthy and it tastes great too. Even my 2 yr old ate it up. Thank you for the great recipe, I plan on taking it with me this x-mas trip for the whole family to taste!

This was very good. I followed other reviewers' recommendations - omitted salt, doubled the garlic, browned an onion with the sausage, and added 1/2 orzo pasta when I threw in the beans. I had an extra cup of spinach so my spinach totaled about 3 cups. I used hot italian sausage. You pretty much can't get this recipe wrong!

TRIED THIS SOUP FOR THE 1ST TIME AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT! ! ! BOUGHT SWEET ITALIAN SAUSAGE FROM COSTCO AND SQUEEZED IT OUT OF THE SKINS.  SAUTEED WITH FRESH GARLIC, NUMEROUS SPICES, 1 LARGE YELLOW ONION.  ALSO ADDED LARGE RED PEPPER, ORZO, CARROTS AND SOME FRESH SNIPPED ROSEMARY. USED FRESH SPINACH AND ZUCHINI, MAY TRY CORN NEXT TIME INSTEAD OF THE BEANS.

I recently submitted a recipe that’s pretty similar to this one to this site, so I had to try this variation out.  I added some oregano and basil to the soup, and I substituted garbanzo beans for the great northerns.  Though I liked the flavor, I found it a little too salty. I know that I am biased, but I prefer my variation over this one.

I was skeptical about a soup recipe this easy but it was very good.  I had company and I was in a pinch to come up with dinner so I through this together.  It was quick and delicious.  I made a few changes:  one extra can of broth, one chopped onion, one chopped red pepper, 2 cans of cannolini beans, frozen spinach, hot pepper flakes and no zuccini.  I was delighted by the results!

This was very easy and very good. Like other reviewers, I also added onions when I browned the hot sausage. The only other change I made was to add sliced mushrooms.  It was a hit with my card club.

Update: 12/5/15  I still make this 8 years later! I use 2 pkgs Alfresco brand Chicken Italian sausage (super low fat!) I also saute 1 medium yellow onion chopped with the sausage.  Amazingly good flavor considering the short cooking time! Threw in some shredded cabbage, chopped Kale & added zucchini last 10 mins. Added 1 can of chicken broth in addition to the beef broth. Kids used to love it!! They are gone, but they make it in their homes now! LOVE THIS!!!!

This was a wonderful soup!!!  I doubled the recipe, added 2 bags frozen tortellini (cooked half way before adding), used 1 lb extra lean ground beef w/ 1 lb italian sausage, 3 cans italian diced tomatoes.  I also added a can of italian tomatoe sauce, lots of garlic & onion. It was a hit to say the least.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This soup was wonderful and very flavorful.  I did omit the spinach and pureed the beans (because my husband doesn't like spinach or beans-I just didn't bother telling him there was beans in it!)  I also added a small package of cheese tortellini to the mix during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  DELICIOUS!

We really enjoyed this soup. I used spicy Italian sausage, low sodium beef broth and did not add any salt or pepper. It was still great and I will make it again. 
Thanks!

My family LOVES this soup!  I add potatoes sliced really thinnly and don't use the spinach. The great thing about this soup, and lots of soup, is that you can add whatever you have/like.  This soup is never the same twice, but its alwasy SO GOOD!

I am on a soup kick this week.  This one is certainly super duper!  My son thought it was "yucky" but that is because it had lots of good vegys in it.  Kids....they don't know whats good.:)

Ok I changed this recipe a bit to suit the likes of my family.  I added some onion to the browning sausage.  Omitted the spinach simply because we didn't have it.  Changed the zuchini to mixed vegetables and some mushrooms because we are mushroom freaks.  I didn't have Italian tomatoes but I used regular diced tomatoes.  I also added some Italian seasoning.  This has quickly become a family favorite and my husband asks for it now almost weekly.  It takes no time at all to throw together and tastes like you've slaved all day.  It's rich and hearty and what more can I say....We love it.

Good soup!  Like another reviewer, though, I substituted turkey italian sausage.  I like the idea of having the spinach in it.  Most soups don't.  I think swiss Chard would be a good substitute for the spinach too.

I made a double batch and added red cabbage and used half hot and half mild italian sausage. An excellent and easy recipe that I am sure I will use again. Enjoy!

Too bad there isn't a ten star rating.  This is such an easy soup to make and it is such a satisfying meal.   It couldn't get better reviews.  I've made it for family as well as friends and everyone goes crazy over it.

This recipe is so darn easy, and so delicious, I've made it twice in the last 3 weeks, everyone loves it. I used 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet sausage the first time, and I used chicken sausage and sweet the 2nd time; both were equally delicious! Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good. Used sliced chicken Andouille sausage because I didn't have Italian & added onions & mushrooms with the garlic. Used one yellow squash & one zucchini, and more spinach than called for. For leftovers, added a can of black-eyed peas. Will definitely make again using Italian sausage.

This was a great recipe for cold winter days.  My husband loved it.  The only change I made was that I added about one cup of macaroni pasta to it.  We served it with warm french bread and butter....very yummy.

This is truly a five star recipe! I used 3 cans beef broth and 2 cans great northern beans to stretch it a little more.  This is a very filling soup and everyone loves it. It made the perfect rainy day lunch for my daughter at work the next day.

AWESOME!  A definite keeper.  This soup took no time to prepare and the results were absolutely delicious.  I made minor adjustments using escarole instead of spinach, and tortellini instead of Northern beans, as suggested by another reviewer. My husband is already waiting for the next batch.

Absolutely delecious!!  I've made this countless times always with delecious results every time.  Most of the time I make it withoug any additions but sometimes I'll add an onion and two small potatoes.  I also use HOT Italian sausage for that extra zing.... Five star soup for a cold winter day!!!

Very very Yummy!  I added noodles.  There is a lot of good spice, next time would leave out salt.  Pork sausage adds plenty of salt.

This was excellent.  Added more garlic and used turkey sausage.  Wonderful starter for a good Italian meal.

Great flavor, fast and easy!  I used hot italian turkey sausage (Turkey Store) links with the casings removed for a lower fat version.  Will definitely make again.

Fantastic.  I found 1/2 pound sweet italian sausage to be enough (reduces the fat a bit, plenty of flavor!).  I put in extra vegies (including lots of fresh spinach) so I added another can of beef broth (low salt on the extra can), and about 1 cup of white wine at the end while simmering.  Served with a slice of beer bread.  Wonderful on a snowy night!

I liked this recipe.  I made it with hot Italian sausage which gives it a good "kick".  It might have been a little spicy for my husband but he's too polite to say anything.  I think next time I make it, I will use 1/2 spicy, 1/2 regular, cut down on the zuchinni (too much for my taste) and add some pasta.  Good overall though, especially on a cold winter day.

This soup is very good! I used homeade chicken broth instead of beef and white rice instead of beans. I bet it would be good with chicken too for a lower fat option. I also drained the sausage and removed the drippings for a lower fat version. I will definately make this again.

While this was good, I'm not sure that I will make it again.  I do like the amount and variety of veggies in it though.  I also added mushrooms and tortellini.  My husband said it was "decent."

Sounded good, so made it for dinner last night. Yummy. I added a chopped onion to mild sausage, the garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also used 1 can chicken broth and 1 can beef broth. Both hubby and I licked our bowls.

I liked this soup and it was pretty easy. I did find that it was too salty. I wouldn't add the salt next time, or the liquid in the canned beans, to cut the sodium. I try to always give the original recipe a chance and not stray the first time. I liked the turkey sausage idea and may try that next time.

Excellent soup!  I used Italian Spicy sausage since we like our soup spicy!  I used 2 cloves of garlic as opposed to 1, and added one small chopped onion while browning the sausage. I rinsed and drained the beans before adding them to the soup.  I also used a whole bag of fresh baby spinach since it basically wilts down to nothing! Delicious!

My husband really loved this soup!  He only had two suggestion:  1) more spinach and 2) make it often.  This is a great way to get more spinach (iron) in you diet.  The only other suggestion I have is to eliminate the salt.

AWESOME soup - very good - excellent flavor.  Go easy on the salt though.  I would use low sodium broth.  I added hot sausage to the regular and it gave it the spicey ZING my hubby loves - GREAT recipe - thanks Karen.  Definately a keeper :)

This recipe is fantastic.  As a heart patient I substitute Butter Ball Sweet Italian TURKEY sausage and nobody can tell the difference.  It's really great with hot crusty bread for a complete meal.

Recipe was bland when I followed recipe exactly, was excellent (we thought)after I added the following: 1 large chopped onion, 1 med peeled and chopped potato, 1 large stalk celery chopped, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1 large beef boullion cube, 1 can lite beer. Simmer at least 1 hour. A real keeper!

This is one of my new favorites!! I don't like zucchini, and my boyfriend isn't a soup fan, but we gobbled this up like it was going out of style. To reduce the fat, I drained the sausage on paper towels before adding the tomatoes and broth. I also added 1/2 cup orzo pasta (which MADE this soup for me). it was SOOOOO good... this is definitely a tasty way to eat veggies!!

Great recipe! My husband does not like pieces of tomatoes in his food so I put the stewed tomatoes in the blender, then added them to the pot. I also added small macaroni the last 10 minutes of cooking to make a really hardy soup! Great recipe!

This soup was wonderful. My husband asked if we could have the rest for the next night's dinner. The only substitution I used was original stewed tomatoes because I didn't have the Italian-style and then added some Italian seasoning. I also used an extra can of broth so I could add 1/2 cup of ditalini and still have enough broth as suggested earlier. And for those who thought it was too salty. Just use low-sodium beef broth. Mine wasn't salty at all. Thanks for the recipe, Karen.

This soup was excellent....I used about 1 1/2lbs. of hot Italian sausage. I browned them and cut them into coin pieces and then added 2 cloves of garlic to the pan and sauteed briefly. I added the sausage to my crockpot with all the rest of the ingredients....(I used a box of frozen spinach, drained and squeezed dry). Cooked on low for about 7 hours. Very hearty and delish! Loved the spiciness of the hot sausage...served with crusty bread and a salad! Will become a winter favorite....and will try hot turkey sausage next time. Thanks!

This soup was really delicious AFTER adding about 3 or 4 additional cups of water to cut down on the saltiness.  We couldn't eat it at first, but the additional water made all the difference.  It was even better on days two and three.  Very unique and very tasty!

Great recipe for winter lunch or dinner.  I made this for a soup and salad theme teacher appreciation lunch at my kids school and it was the only one of four pots of soup that was totally devoured!  I used spicy Italian sausage and served it with fresh parmesan cheese to sprinkle on top.

My teenage son made this as part of a project for
his Italian class...even his younger brother who
isn't crazy about vegetables asked for a bigger
bowl of this and skipped the main course.  My
husband, who had seen the garlic out when this was being prepared and thinks he hates zucchini, was refusing to even taste it.  When I got him to taste one spoonful, he asked for a large bowl also.  Wow!  They are *all* eating vegetables and it was so easy to make.

THIS RECIPE WAS VERY GOOD, BUT IT LACKED THREE SIMPLE THINGS THAT I THINK MADE IT EXCEPTIONAL. FIRST I SAUTEED A FEW GREEN ONIONS ALONG WITH THE SAUSAGE AND GARLIC. JUST BEFORE ADDING THE REST OF INGREDIENTS I ADDED ABOUT 3/4 TSP WHOLE THYME AND ABOUT 1/2 TSP OREGANO. ALSO, IF YOU CAN FIND RAPPINI, USE IT IN PLACE OF SPINACH AND ADD IT IN WITH TOMATOES & CARROT. WHAT A MEAL WITH A BIG CHUNK OF GARLIC BREAD !!!

Great recipe!  I had fun reading all the reviews and spicing it up a bit.  I used canned diced tomatoes, celery, cauliflower, hot sausage, and red pepper flakes.  It was delicious!

This was easy and fast to prepare.  I used mild italian sausage, and I still found the soup a bit spicy.  My niece absolutely loved the soup and had three helpings of it.  I will make it again, but will try a different brand of sausage.

We LOVED this recipe.  I added chopped onion, a little Italian Seasoning, chopped the spinach rather fine, and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese!!!  WOW - The cheese really topped off the flavor!  It's easy, fast and yummy!  Next time I will definately double the recipe so we have leftovers.  Thanks Karen

This is an AWESOME recipe.  I took the advice of some others, and added and extra can each of broth and tomatoes, and a half cup of small pasta.  It was sooo good that my husband asked me not to even add the spinach.  Definitely a keeper.  Really does taste alot like my favorite Olive Garden soup.  Thanks!

An excellent soup!  Salty though, so I would omit the salt and use low-salt ingredients wherever possible.

This was really, really excellent, and as others said - it looks so colorful when it's all together! I followed the recipe, with the following modifications: upped the broth to 6 cups, used a 10oz package of frozen spinach instead of fresh, added a generous amount of crushed red pepper, and added 1 cup dried mini pasta shells (which i boiled separately) in the end. Next time i'll bump it down to 1/2 cup of pasta.

Delicious soup.  Next time I'll add more beans and more broth.  Be careful of the sausage -- it can be too spicey.

Wow - best soup I've ever made!I cannot believe how much flavor is in this soup! The only changes I made are (1)used Butterball lean turkey/pork sausage, (2)added a few dashes of hot sauce (3)used lower sodium broth (4)for spinach, used about a handful of thawed frozen apinach from the bag and (5)cooked the whole thing (besides browning the sausage first) in the crockpot. A must keep recipe...

I loved this soup the first time I tried it - and that was about 1 year ago! I've been making it at least 2-3 times a month since. So easy, and delicious! I follow the directions exactly, except I add some red pepper flakes to give it a little spice. Use recipes from this site all the time and this is my all time favorite!  Thanks for sharing it!

YUM. This was terrific soup. I reduced the sausage to half a pound and that was plenty for me. I also used hot turkey Italian sausage and chicken broth. Next time, I think Ill leave out the spinach, as I really dont care for it in soups. This was very quick and was nice to have in the fridge for dinners after work. Ill make this again, thats for sure..

This soup was amazing. I made it 3 times in the past week. I made it with both hot Italian sauage and with Turkey Italian sausage. Both were great. My son even called me from the grocery store yesterday for the ingredients. WOW quick and easy for a terrific meal, add bread and go...

A good hearty soup. I used hot and mild sausage and it was awesome. I served it with some fresh sourdough bread. Everyone loved it. I made it again the next day for my friend that just moved into to her new house so they would have a decent meal for a few days. (instead of pizza) They really enjoyed it as well.

Lovely soup!  I added more garlic,some chopped onion  and celery.  Used 2 cans of tomatoes as my hubby likes a lot of broth.  I used shredded cabbage instead of the spinach, just a personal preference.  Added 2 cups cooked elbow macaroni at the end.  Will make this often this winter!

Added half an onion when browning the sausage, and used frozen spinach during the last 10 minutes of simmering. Absolutely delicious!

I made it exactly as directed and loved it.  I did use only half a pound of sweet Italian sausage as that's what I had on hand and found it was plenty.  I loved this soup and will absolutely make it again!

I made this but I did have to substitute Italian turkey sausage (saved a trip to the store) and added a half cup of diced  onions with the garlic when cooking. Delicious! Husband who normally doesn’t like my cooking ate two big bowls! It makes a very tasty broth too! Will definitely add to recipe trove and want to try with the hot Italian turkey sausage next time.

My family loved this recipe. Next time I will omit the 1/4 tsp salt and maybe use reduced sodium broth as well. I added a couple of potatoes (peeled and diced) along with the beans and zucchini. Colorful presentation and flavorful to the palate.

So good.  Would have been good to indicate if the sausage should be removed from casing, which I did to ensure every bite had some sausage.  Also used a combo of 1/2 hot and 1/2 mild Italian sausage

Excellent, hearty soup; full of flavour nutrition and comforting warmth.  It benefits from flakes of Parmesan at serving.  Hot sauce on the side was good, as my sausages were quite mild.

The soup is absolutely amazing, I did make a couple of changes but not going to bother to post them because everybody else already did. I would give it a 10 if I could!! Thank you so much for this recipe.

I add more garlic and ditalini pasta.  This is a cross between a minestrone and a pasta fazool (as we call it in New England).  Terrific recipe and very filling.  Great for a winter night.  Easy and flavorful.

Delicious! My son accidentally picked up the spicy Italian sausage, which was tasty, but if I make it again I’ll try with the non-spicy sausage. Otherwise I made just as directed and it was great!

A keeper! I prefer hot sausage, my husband likes mild--I used the hot, but instead of zucchini I added a chopped sweet potato and yellow pepper. This, along with regular stewed tomatoes, extra carrots and chicken stock, really added the right amount of sweetness. I let it sit for 2 days, too. Perfection.

I love this soup. Have made it pkenty of times and have shared with friends.  I like to use the spicey italian sausage, use white beans and add extra spinach. Make sure if you use more than 1 can of beans that you rinse the second can or it will change the flavor. I also take the tomatoes out and dice them small.  Your family will love this.

Followed others ideas . . . added onion with sausage and made pasta to add to it, but it really did not need it . Delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Enjoyed the soup, but have tasted much better soups.  The Slow Cooker Zucchini Soup on this site is very similar, but I think much better.  I have made that one several times.

Love love love this soup. I diced all the veggys for texture and used ground turkey instead of sausage. I have made it about 4 times and given recipe to others who enjoyed. Will continue to make. Easy to make

Truly deserving of 5 stars.  Pretty simple and easy to make, great tasting!  I used hot sausage for a little kick and it worked beautifully.

Chuck full of flavors.  I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did.  Used 1 pound sweet and one pound hot sausage   Making another larger batch for my husband and his friends to take to the cabin during hunting season.

Excellent recipe, one of my wife’s favorite soups. I did go with 2 cloves garlic vs 1 and skipped the salt since I didn’t use low sodium broth. This base recipe is perfect to use with other ingredients in the pantry such as potato. But you can’t go wrong just following it as written. Great recipe.

I made this.  May make again, but with no added salt and more hot spices (maybe red pepper flakes and/or cayenne pepper) and spinach.  Added fresh jalapenos with seeds, but they weren't very spicy.  May use less beef broth and add water instead.

Loved it. I always use low/no sodium canned products and then add sea salt to taste - sea salt is lower in sodium. It’s a keeper!

This was fabulous!! The texture of everything was perfect. The only thing I omitted was the wine as I am allergic. I used chicken broth instead. I added some red pepper flakes for a bit of extra spice. I was going to take a photo but we dived in too fast! We had fresh snapped green beans on the side. This is a keeper!!

I've made this a dozen times and always a hit. I normally leave out zucchini but added it this time for extra nutrient. I doubled up the recipe. Trying to cut down on sugar so I'll eat this all week with salad. I used 1lb spicy, 1lb mild Italian sausage, added sautéed carrots & onions, and kale (sometimes baby sometimes regular kale). I need to make this more often but will make sure to add more beans (I drain & rinse vs using the entire can w/ liquids). Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

This is one of my favorite soups that have made over and over again for years.  I don't modify it much.  I have switched to using kale instead of spinach because the spinach breaks down too much if you have to reheat the soup.  Kale holds up better.  In autumn, I use fresh shelled Borlotti beans in it instead of canned.  I like it more like soup than stew so I use 2 32-ounce boxes of beef broth and it's still super hearty.  So delicious!

I made this!  It was AWESOME.

I made a few adjustments because I didn't have the exact ingredients and honestly i love the way my version of this tastes.

I had a big package of italian sausage i needed to use so I ended up doubling the recipes.  Instead of beef broth i used chicken broth.  Instead of stewed tomatoes I did diced and probably a bit less than the recipe calls for.  I added some italian seasoning and chili pepper.  I didn't put in any salt and it was salty enough for me.

I also didn't add northern beans (I didn't have any) and used arugala instead of spinach.  The arugala gives it a great flavor but I would say if you don't like the bitter flavor of arugala to begin with, stick with the spinach.

This soup was very good, I do agree with another reviewer though that it is necessary to use low sodium beef broth, it ended up being pretty salty. I used mild Italian sausage, and doubled the broth, added 1/2 cup of orzo noodles, doubled the tomatoes and beans, added extra garlic and half of an onion when I cooked the sausage. This soup is extremely versatile, and I love that you can pretty much add anything to it and it will still turn out good. Next time I will probably use diced tomatoes because my bf and I aren’t a huge fan of big pieces of tomato. I kept the spirit of the soup the same and just ended up doubling the tomatoes, beans and garlic to make up for the extra broth I added to put in the orzo noodles. I think next time I might add some green/red peppers and some celery. It was very easy to make after a long day at work, and the leftovers were delicious!

easy and quick.  key is to have excellent quality sausage with good flavor.  I skipped the garlic - wasn't needed due to my wonderful sausage.   kale would be good substitute for the spinich.

This was very good...the whole family enjoyed it. I added an onion, an extra can of fire roasted tomatoes, and noodles. I used frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh and left the zucchini off. Served it with cheddar/mozzarella grilled cheese sandwiches and it was a hit. The soup is a great meal on its own but I have two teenaged boys who eat a lot! I will definitely make this again.

More garlic for sure. I did sweet pork sausage and added red pepper flakes for the kick. Lots of parmesan cheese. Next time I’ll mix some in when I put the spinach in to give it some time to melt down. I would also say only 5-7 mins for the zucchini rather than 15 as it was a bit mushier than I prefer after simmering that long.

So yummy!!! Love this soup! Prepared it exactly as indicated, with the only addition being 2-3 small russet potatoes diced and added at the same time as the carrots. Mmmm! Definitely will make again and again. :)

I browned the sausage with extra garlic in a pan then moved it all into a slowcooker and cooked on LOW for 5 hours (as someone else had recommended).  My husband said it lacked depth.  But I think it's because I added extra broth and didn't add salt and pepper.  So he added salt and pepper as well as worcestershire sauce and then said it was delicious!  He wants me to make it again!!

Fantastic!  I tweaked a bit after looking at some reviews.  I doubled the garlic, added a chopped onion, added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning, and a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis (in addition to the can of stewed tomatoes). We like it spicy so I used hot sausage.  This makes your house smell terrific!  Thank you a great recipe-definitely a keeper!

Exquisite!!!! This was my first time making any type of soup. I was hesitant because it looked like a vegetable soup, which I’ve never been a fan of. I recommend doubling the recipe. It was a big hit. My young daughter thought it was my “Best new recipe yet” and my son said, “You really did it this time!”

This is a great easy soup to make.  I just threw everything into a pot and cook d it until the zucchini was done.  I used fresh tomates instead of the stewed tomatoes.  It was delicious and easy!

This is one of my favorite soup recipes now. Made it the other night and everyone in my house loved it. I used cubed potatoes instead of beans (personal preference) and added 1/2 cup orzo. I also used Hot italian sausage. I also served it with fresh grated parmesan cheese on top.  It's a keeper! Thanks for sharing

Made this vegetarian by substituting the beef broth for veggie broth and substituting the sausage for an 8 oz pack of Italian seasoned seitan. Also added an onion. So good and easy! Definitely adding this to the rotation.

The sausage gives the soup so much flavor!  I used plain ground Italian sausage (not in casings), and I think that really helped the flavor.  I'll be making this many more times.

This was the BEST sausage soup I’ve ever made, and ever TASTED for that matter! I did leave out the beans because I don’t like them, but I made up for the liquid that would have been in the can of beans by adding extra broth. It was phenomenal! Thank you for this awesome recipe!! If I could give it ten stars I would!

This soup is my absolute favorite. My boyfriend always raves about it, and we’ve made it about 10 times over the past 2 months.  It is 5 stars exactly as written buthis also easy to customize.  I do recommend draining the sausage though before adding the next ingredients and my zucchini generally doesn’t need to simmer 15 minutes.  I use 1/2 lb sweet Italian sausage and 1/2 lb spicy.  The soup is very hearty and not very brothy, so if I’m in the mood for more broth I add an extra 2 cups or water with some beef bouillon depending on what I have on hand. I have also made with cheese tortellini instead of the beans and it was amazing! Sometimes I chop half an onion if I have one on hand, and I use more garlic if I have it.  I got a new Dutch oven for Christmas and the first thing I did was go buy the ingredients for this soup.  I’ve even made it in the mini kitchen of a hotel when traveling for work because I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I tell everyone about it, because it’s seriously so good.

You can also make this with black beans and any mix of veggies. Such as onion, celery, bell pepper. Additional spices could be garlic, thyme, oregano.

I've made this recipe more than 10x.  I use 16-18oz of spicy Italian saus.  Links or ground both work. If using links, take a knife, pierce the sausage casing and remove by peeling it off so it's easier to break up the link meat.  I would NOT recommend  using the suggested/Advertised Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage that is listed in the Ingredients.
I've substituted potatoes for the beans  and added celery instead of zucchini. Either  way, this recipe is a keeper.

I did change a little due to not having some ingredients. I switched out beans with chick peas and drained the can, added an additional stewed tomato can, and added red pepper flakes to add heat - I don't think these changes are necessary at all but you can mix it up a little! This soup was amazing!!

To the sausage, I added:
one extra clove of garlic
1/2 of a small onion, diced

When I added the tomatoes, I also added:
a few sprigs of fresh thyme and rosemary (remove stems when soup is done cooking)
a parmesan rind

To serve, I added a couple of heaping tablespoons of cooked tubettini pasta to each bowl, mixed it in and then garnished with fresh grated parmesan cheese.

1.20.19  I was a little short on the spinach, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  My husband thought it was a little bland, but I think he was expecting the sausage to have more of a kick.  I used Johnsonville® mild ground Italian sausage, so that may the reason for his comment.  To appease him, I did add some red pepper flakes and a healthy dose of Tabasco® Sriracha., and admittedly, I then liked it better, too!  We were pleased with the way this turned out.  Easy enough to make for sure, and was the perfect soup for a cool winter day.

I made this recipe as stated, other than adding one more zucchini and excluding the salt. I liked it. My husband wanted more spice - a tbsp of oregano, a tbsp of thyme, tbsp of basil,  tsp of salt and a tsp of black pepper. And also one onion.

It was amazing! My in-laws loved it and no one knew I used Turkey sausage. I used one more can of low sodium beef broth and added mushrooms. I also added cooked elbow pasta at the very end.

Amazing recipe!! I made it for the first time today although I doubled the amount, I also tweaked it by adding slices of fully cooked sausages (mild and honey-garlic), I also added about a cup of sweet corn, a can of diced tomatoes, and added Acini di pepe noodles. Also for seasonings I added about a table spoon of fresh thyme and a table spoon of dried Italian seasonings. I also had simmered it for about and hour and a half to let the broth soak up some of the juices from the sausages, before adding the spinach and zucchini. The outcome was truly amazing. ??????

This is an amazing soup.. I’m sure if I had all of the ingredients as described it would have been just as amazing. I doubled and I’m glad I did. It was almost all gone. I did not have the Italian stewed tomatoes so I used regular canned peeled whole tomatoes I did use Italian seasoning to help it along and used 5ish cloves of garlic added 1 large onion and used 1 lb sweet and 1 lb spicy sausage i doubled the veggies as I really wanted the veggies to stand out along with the beans a 32 oz container of low sodium beef broth plus 2 cups of water  . I served with crusty bread. It was amazing. Thank you for the recipe!

Wow! Fantastic. Made it exactly as directed and it was wonderful.  I made it again with what I had on hand and use a slow cooker.  Omitted carrots,  beans and spinach and subbed cubed potatoes and chopped kale. Added some red pepper for a little kick. Family raved. Will make it again on holidays and for company.

This is Delicious! I doubled the recipe and made some changes based on personal preferences and what I had on hand--omitted zucchini and added a chopped onion and cubed red potatoes. Used homemade turkey broth instead of beef. Added some marjoram and rosemary and lots more minced garlic. Also threw in some pasta--I had the little ABC's in the pantry. It was very rich and filling!

I really loved this soup.  I would like to try it again and replace the sausage with Italian seasoned ground turkey.  It was just a bit greasy even though I did drain the sausage well.  This soup was great meal with warm french bread.

Been making it for a couple of years.. I play with it adding different ingredients..  Sometimes escarole instead of spinach and this last time i added garbanzo beans also!
Delish over rice with Parmesan cheese.
Love this hearty soup!

I will absolutely make this soup again.  I enjoy stretching meals and repurposing parts of meals from earlier in the week.  I prepared a killer scratch chicken cacciatore and used the excess sauce for the base of this soup. No one remotely recognized it other than me.  The sausage, white beans and spinach made it so unique my husband has asked that this become a regular.  He could not get enough of this hearty soup with the crusty crispy dipped corn bread.  Thank you allrecipes!

I made this pretty much as is. I just added a little more sausage and mixed sweet with hot like someone suggested. Not necessary, but if you like a little kick, it's a nice touch. I used regular carrots, peeled and sliced them. They absorbed the flavor of the soup quite nicely! The zucchini got a little mushy. That was my only issue. Otherwise, delish as written!!! And easy too!

This was a really hearty soup. Made it as directed except added one extra can broth and a half cup ditalini pasta.  I also used chopped frozen spinach which worked very well in the soup. The Italian sausage I used was sweet Italian turkey sausage. Served with a rustic bread. This one I will make again and again. Thank you for submitting this recipe Sally!

It was really good. Like others, I adapted the recipe. I used chicken broth instead of beef broth, used turkey sausage, reduced the garlic, and eliminated the salt (the sausage is very salty). I also added more broth and water. I'll definitely put this in the rotation.

Absolutely delicious and so very easy!  I used lean chicken/tomato/basil sausage because that’s what I had on hand, and added a little ditalini pasta to the soup.  Soooo good, and healthy, too.  I will definitely make this again and again!

I can't review this recipe exactly, because I made a few changes. I had a ton of fresh vegetables and just chopped them up and threw them in there, but this recipe gave me the idea of adding beef broth and italian sausage. I really liked this soup in general, and I think it would be even better with some rice!

This soup is pretty easy and was tasty.  I used potatoes instead of beans to make it a little more hearty.  I will be making this again during the winter months.

Based on highly liked reviews, I used the best of all advice the first time around: doubled the garlic, added a chopped onion to crumbled hot Italian sausage, used two cans of diced tomatoes, and 18 extra ounces of beef stock. Because I didn’t have Italian style tomatoes (and I like fresh herbs), I added 1 tbsp fresh shredded basil, 2 Tbsp fresh parsley and sprinkles of dry oregano. Also two large zucchini’s and the 1/2 c orzo. I agree...it’s a new staple!!

Easy peasy! To lower the salt  content, I used unsalted beef broth and turkey sausage. I also added cooked ditalini  at the end. It was delicious and my husbands favorite.

I have been making this soup at least once a month for 3 years.  Have not deviated from the recipe.  It is outstanding.  Gotta have the cheese and the pasta at the end.  A crowd pleaser for sure.

Walmart didn't have Italian sausage so I had to buy the regular kind and season it with Italian seasoning.  I also omitted the beans since I am not supposed to eat beans or legumes of any kind.  I doubled the recipe and it turned out wonderfully!!!!  My whole family loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made a double batch as I wanted leftovers to have for lunch during the week. I used TJ's spicy Italian chicken sausage,  a box and a half of low sodium beef  broth, 1 can diced tomato, 2 cans stewed tomato , 2 cans Northern beans and added a chopped yellow onion 6 cloves minced garlic. For seasoning I used crushed red pepper,  oregano and salt and pepper  to taste. For the fresh veggies, I used about a cup chopped carrots (less than what is called for but I don't like a lot of carrots in my soup) 3 cubed small zucchini and a standard bag of baby spinach. I tried to serve all of the spinach in the supper portions and plan to have more spinach on hand to add to the hot lunch portions. It wilts really fast and gets lost, so I assume it won't reheat well. I serves with a handful of cooked cheese tortellini in the bottom of each bowl. I will make it again, maybe with a little tomato paste to thicken it up.

Love this soup! Most soups tast better the next day and this is souper flavorful the day you make it.  Very versatile if you use the sausage, garlic, tomatatoes, broth  and seasonings as the base.   I have used all kinds of  variations such as green peppers, kale &  pasta depending what I have in the fridge.   So  comforting.

Love this recipe I've made it multiple times. Only thing I did different after a few times of making it was I added more diced tomatoes.  Personal taste.  Making it again tonight!

Love this recipe. Even picky husband loved it. Only change was I added more broth, and simmered the carrots longer till tender.

While no one mentioned, skim off oil derived from sausage periodically, during simmering process. Didn’t add any salt till very end, waiting to see how much broth and sausage would add. I had some homemade uncooked linguine, which I cut up into pieces and added same time as zucchini. After the first time you make this dish, you’ll feel comfortable modifying to your own taste, and be creative adding different ingredients.

Easy, tasty recipe. My modifications included:  Substituted kidney beans for great northern beans (b/c that’s what was in my pantry). Added1 cup coarsely chopped onion to the first step; sautéed onions with minced garlic in a tablespoon of olive oil prior to browning sausage. Served over cooked spiral pasta for some added heartiness.

Delicious!!!   This is super easy to make and it's packed with flavor.  I added a 1/2 cup of uncooked orzo the last 10 minutes.  I only had arugala in the house, so I used that.  This soup is nice and hearty.

It was yummy! I used vegetarian Italian sausage links I stead of ground sausage. And cut them in sliced chunks. And added sliced mushrooms. And i used vegetarian beef flavored stock. Otherwise I followed the recipe mostly. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a favorite in my house. My husband asks for it every winter, multiple times! The only change I've ever made is added some more Italian herb blend if I don't have the specific Italian stewed tomatoes on hand. This recipe is perfect how it is.

I use better than bouillon base but everything else the same. Perfect with a warmed loaf of hearty bread and dash of Parmesan cheese.

This soup is delicious!  I did have to make some changes because I didn’t have everything in the recipe.  I used plain petite diced tomatoes, and added some oregano and basil a little sugar and some onion powder.  I don’t really care for zucchini, so instead i added 1 can of Veg-All drained and 1 can of sliced carrots.  Also added about 1 1/2 cups of diced potatoes and 1 small box of frozen chopped spinach.  Sprinkled a little shredded Parmesan on top and it was sooo good!  Thanks ;)

I used a mix of pork and turkey Italian sausage and I grow my own kale and spinach so I used a little of both.  This was really tasty.  I did add a little Italian seasoning and some garlic powder just to punch up the flavor.  Going to be a keeper.

Oh my this was so good!!! So simple to put together, my little girl went Mmmmmmmm! after her first bite. I changed a few things only because it was what I had on hand. I used a can of mixed beans, frozen spinach, and canned zucchini in Italian sauce. I added an onion and cubed potato. Topped it off with some freshly grated parmesan cheese.  So good!!! Especially with a loaf of my Dutch oven artisan bread. a keeper for sure, I will definitely be making this again!

Came across this soup with excellent reviews.  Thought I'd give it a try.  I must say, it was EXCELLENT!  The only thing I did differently was I used plant based sausages (Field Roast) as I don't eat meat but it still tasted so good!!!  Everyone in the house wanted a second and wants me to make this again!

Instead of zucchini and beans, I added half a pkg of cooked cheese tortellini. Also added crushed red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Made about half the recipe and my husband and I ate it for 2 days. Still had enough left over to freeze for later.

Delicious! Fairly quick and Most definitely on an easy level. The only thing I did differently was butter, onion and parsley flakes with a Tbsp of butter, just until fragrant. I Then followed the recipe. The kids and husband loved it! Fairly quick it’s made it to my recipe book.

Delicious!! I followed one reviewer’s suggestion and used half hot Italian sausage and half regular. I also added some egg soup noodles and doubled the broth.

I made the soup as directed. Doubled the recipe. I felt like it was "missing" something.  So added instant white rice, and more beef broth, and that did the trick. Was a delicious combination, and more hearty to eat

Made this for the first time today, and it definitely won't be the last! SO delicious, and super easy! I made it just the way the recipe was written, although I'm sure a lot of the modifications are great, too! I'll probably try frozen or canned spinach next time. Make this - you won't regret it! :)

I made this as stated and added some ditalini pasta which I cooked separately. I did use only 1/2 pound of sweet Italian sausage and felt a whole pound would have overpowered the soup. Hubby and I both loved it. I served it with garlic and parmesan cheese toasted Italian bread. A wonderful meal on a cold night.

We substitute the beans for riced cauliflower and extra zucchini.  I also double the protein and add an even mix of hot and sweet italian sausage.  I need to double the recipe for my family to have enough leftovers to satisfy them.  We love it.  Its hearty and so so good.  Love this soup.  Might try it with potatos as it sounds like something my kids will eat.  I've made this a couple of times and it has already become a staple in our rotation.

I have made this soup a few times staying very close to the original recipe, today I  I drifted. Forgot to get spinach,  used pasta shells, and 2 kinds of beans.  Holy Cow, everybody who had it loved it.

I made this exactly as in the recipe and it was excellent.  It's a very hearty, filling soup.  Everyone in the family from the teens to the four year old and husband enjoyed it and asked for seconds.  I served it with some Parmesan cheese and yeast rolls.  I'll be making it again!

This was very tasty. I used half sweet, half spicy sausage for an extra kick. Added some ditalini pasta.

This soup was wonderful.    If there was ever a time to lick your bowl in front of guests - this was it.

This is a delicious soup! I used a full carton of unsalted beef broth & added some Farfalline Pasta, Italian Seasoning & Herbs Provence otherwise, followed the recipe as written. Used the unsalted beef broth so it wouldn't be so salty as one cook had commented was a problem.

This was really good!!  The only difference was I used kale instead of spinach. I like that it was quick and easy. Will definitely make again!!

left out carrots and used regular tomatoes.  Added my own Italian seasoning because I don't like sweet.  If you do,  make as recipe says.

Good soup.  Made half whole foods crumbled chicken sausage, half whole foods pork sausage. Good but just a lot of sausage overall which makes it seem salty.

This was ok but disappointing as I did not think it was as flavorful as it should be given all the ingredients. Even as leftovers the soup was bland. Could have used some green spices and/or red pepper flakes.

It was good, but I still don't know if I'm going to make it again. Truthfully, it's not a bad soup, I just don't (having now made it) that it's my kind of soup.

Part way through my review on my phone, somehow I submitted before I was done. Here's what I did: Pulsed one large onion in food processor (FP.). Removed casing from a package of Johnsonville brats. In a large pot break up sausage into chunks. Add chopped onions and sautée until meat is done. Pulse spinach leaves ( half of a large Costco container. Took three batches in Cuisinart - it wouldn't pulse if too full. Probably 6 cups chopped. Add to the meat. Pulse a bunch of celery, probably 3 cups pulsed. Add to meat. Pour in one large can (32 oz?) of crushed tomatoes. Add 32 oz of water -or so. Add one beef and one chicken bouillon- mrs. knife - pretty big cubs - makes 2 cups broth each.Add Italian seasoning. 1-2 Tablespoons? Add sugar. 2-4Tablespoons? Add garlic salt a 1 tablespoon? Taste. Add red wine, about a cup. Add one csn iofwhite beans. 16 oz? But more would be fine. It was good with biggish chunks of sausage. Let simmer for an hour or so. It's better the longer it sits. I turned off heat and let it start to cool then ate it. Delicious!

I doubled the recipe, had friends and family visiting all weekend everyone loved the soup. I kept the recipe as written, except I left out the extra salt and used low sodium broth. Great Soup will definitely make it again.

YUMMY!  Goes together fast and we loved it! Would give 6 stars if I could.  I did add  extra broth, used 32 oz. box instead of 2 - 14 oz. cans.  Also like the cup of Ditalini pasta, added it with beans and zucchini.

This is a hearty and healthy tasting soup. We liked it, but didn't love it. I would consider making this a few times a year, but it won't make my regular rotation.

Exceptionally good.  Now it's become a staple in our house.   Even better the next day.  Freezes well.  I store it in individual containers so I can microwave for lunch instead of a sandwich.  Very satisfying.

I add red pepper at the table because I'm the only one who likes a little heat.  Or, you can use hot Italian sausage.  I can't to please the family.

Great recipe but I altered it quite a bit. Added can of cream of mushroom soup, half onion, 40 oz of beef broth, one 19oz Bag of frozen cheese tortellini from Walmart. Next time I make it I will double the Italian sausage. My family loved it.

good use for Sam's Club sausage. use all three packs and double the ingredients in the recipe. after first test batch, plan on modifying with orzo or couscous, onion, and whatever else I might have on hand. great way to get the family to eat zucchini.

I made it and doubled the garlic , diced onion and 1 potato.  I omitted the spinach but that's because my husband will not eat it.  It was very good.   Thanks for the Recipe!  We enjoyed it!

Loved this made changes based on what I had one hand. Used homemade frozen chicken stock I had. I doubled the beans. Used mild sausage, but added some red pepper flakes as I felt it needed a little more heat. I added some chopped onion too. Used 16 oz bag of frozen chopped spinach. Had frozen tomatoes from our garden in place of canned. I let it simmer for much longer before adding the spinach and zucchini. Added a splash of Half and Half to each bowl before serving for some creaminess. Reminds me of Zuppa Tuscana from Olive Garden. Would be great with potatoes instead of beans if you wanted.

This is great. I added chopped onion with the sausage and garlic, and added more broth because I added pearl couscous too. Freezes well. Tastes awesome. Our sausage was from a local farm and I did add some red pepper flakes too.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did add an extra can of stewed tomatoes and used one carton and one can of beef broth. I substituted a half a head of cabbage for the spinach. I also added some onions. I would absolutely make this again.  I also drained and rinsed the beans. This decreased the salt content.

I've made this several times; it's so surprisingly delicious, yet simple.  I don't change anything.  I've made it for company in Winter, and is satisfying with crusty bread.
I do have one concern, with regard to the nutrition info.  I don't see how there can be so many fat grams.  I'm using Caninos mild Italian sausage, and it says 8 grams of fat per serving.  Nothing else in the soup has any fat worth noting.
I'd like to have this info checked, because I'm using myfitnesspal app, and the recipe does load into the app just fine, but I don't think the nutrition info is accurate.

Absolutely loved this recipe! Made it for my husband who loves sausage as I was getting tired of sausage and peppers. This was a big winner for him. I added a bit more sausage and spinach per the recipe. This is a great meal!!!! Even the kids liked it!!!!

Such a great soup! My 3 year old ate 3 bowls of it. Easy and pretty quick to make. I added 1/2 head of cabbage I had on hand, a pinch of dill and summer savory, a splash of liquid smoke, and used better than beef bouillon instead of canned beef broth. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Kind of bland. I had to add a lot of shredded Parmesan cheese to make the broth tastier. There are better recipes out there!

I was skeptical about liking this soup but I knew if 2000 people loved it, I should try it.  I thought I would dislike the sausage in it, but I really really liked it.

I did not have carrots so I used mini red peppers as a substitute, I think this contributed to the flavor.   I also used celery. a red onion, and a sweet potato. 

Delicious, fast, and inexpensive..

I did not add the beans. I added 1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning, sliced mushrooms, and increased the garlic to 2 cloves. I cooked tortellini in a separate pot and served the soup over it. We have some in our family who do not eat gluten, so everyone could eat the same  meal. Family LOVED it. Served with crusty Italian bread and parmesan cheese. We will have it again soon.

4 stars because I made adjustments, but great base!  After reading lots of reviews...I did the following 1)  3 cans , low-sodium broth 2) 2 cans tomatoes 3) extra carrots - probably 1-1/3 cup 4) a few dashes italian seasoning 5) 1-2 dashes crushed red pepper 6) 1/2-2/3 cup pasta added in last 15 minutes  7) 1/4 C. White wine (not 7 1/4 cup :) that is just #7 I drank the rest) Ha Ha! 8) 2 pods garlic and 1 medium chopped onion 9)  Frozen instead of fresh spinach.  I served with cornbread, which I'm sure is not Italian in any sense of the word, but it was goooood!

I made this in a pressure cooker and it was fantastic.  I left out the beans, and the second time I made it I swapped the spinach for kale, which gave it a much better texture.  I also tried it with chicken sausage, but that was pretty tasteless.

I've followed this recipe exactly as written and I've also experimented around with it using different vegetables and noodles.  I liked it every time.  The combination of broth, tomatoes, garlic, and sausage is very flavorful.

This soup was delicious.  I took the suggestion of several people and browned about half an onion with the garlic and sausage.  I also added about 1/2 tsp fresh thyme.

Very good. I added a some red pepper flakes to give  it a little more kick, and as always, the quality of the sausage  will make or break  a  dish like this.  It was actually even better the next day when I reheated it.  Thanks for a good winters day recipe!

This was very good. I added an onion before the garlic, and I used chicken broth instead of beef and green bean instead of zucchini. Cut the broth down to 1 box of Emeril, so it came out thicker like a stew. Used hot italian sausage, which was pretty spicy. I like spicy and thought it was awesome, but will likely repeat at some point with sweet sausage for peeps that like less spicy. Was great for a cold weekend, and fairly inexpensive for a large double batch.

I made this today and it is delicious!  I added potatoes and onions to it.  Also when I added the beans I mashed some of them up in the can to give the soup some thickness.  very very good.

Loved the soup.  I used half sweet sausage and half hot sausage.  This gave a little kick but not over powering.

So simple to make.  I used a mild Italian sausage, 4 cloves of fresh garlic, fried a small onion with the sausage, added 1/3cup of Orzo pasta. So delicious. My family loved it. I will keep this recipe in my family favourites.

Excellent easy soup!! I didn't have spinach on hand, but I will definitely try that next time. I added mini raviolis and it was delicious! Next time, I will double the recipe for sure.

Delicious! However I made a few changes. I doubled the garlic, added 2 fresh roma tomatoes,  slightly more carrots and spinach, and about a tbsp of Italian seasoning. I also added in some pasta to make it heartier. I cooked the pasta first and added it in with the spinach.

This soup is really good. I did make a couple of modifications, I julienned the carrots, used mushrooms instead of zucchini , used turkey sausage and have made it with and without the spinach. I prefer it without the spinach!

I made it like the recipe said the first time and i would rate it a 4 I made it the second time and for the most part followed the directions EXCEPT I added half a cup on onions, 1 tbsp dried italian seasoning and 4 rough chopped mushrooms (after all the main cooking was done) and and OMG rated it a 5 absolutely loved this soup will make again and again and again 
PS a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese would be great on this when its being served I think will try it next time

Have made this several times.  Using bulk sausage gives you a taste of sausage in every spoonful, and using link sausage that's been cut into small pieces downplays the sausage taste just a bit.  Either way, it is scrumptious.  The terrific thing about homemade soup is that you can taste every individual ingredient, and also tweak the salt and other spices to your own taste.  I had never had this kind of soup before, and now it's one of my very favorites.   Great recipe!!

I've made this recipe several times.  It is visually appealing, which soup often isn't. I love my food to be pretty!  This recipe is easily varied, so don't be afraid to experiment if you don't have zucchini, for example.  It makes a great starter, or can be used as a meal.  If you're extra hungry, just add fresh bread.

This one is quickly becoming a favorite in my household. My only substitute is I use baby kale instead of spinach, since I don't like limp spinach in my soup.

I used a little  bit  of  olive oil to brown the sausage  and garlic. Next time I would  use  more broth, maybe 3 cans instead of  2 plus a cup of water. I like a lot of broth  in my soups.  Soup turned out delicious, colorful and  hearty.

Made the recipe as written.  It was a little bit salty for us, but we still loved it.  In all fairness, we don't eat a lot of salty foods so it still rates 5 stars in our house.

I will be making his again! I added half an onion just to use it. I also had to add garlic salt at the end because it was bland... maybe it was because I used low sodium broth but not too sure. Either way it was an easy fix and delicious. I sprinkled parmesson when serving  :)

I followed the recipe except to do 2 cans tomatoes and 32 oz beef broth and 1 can chicken broth. I also did 1/2 sweet and 1/2 hot Italian sausage. It was GREAT! (Oh yes, and I did dice in a potato and 1/2 box of ditalini pasta) I will definitely make this again. Served it with sliced buttered bread.

This is a definite favorite in our house.  The only thing I do different is swap kale for spinach.  I add the kale when I add the beans and it cooks perfect (you could always add it sooner if you like it softer).  Awesome recipe, thanks for sharing!

good but lacks seasoning. Add 1 onion.  Add 3 cloves garlic instead of 1. Add a 1/4 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp thyme. I used a can of diced tomato. I made a double batch and used a 1/4 box of orzo pasta.  Delicious. Will definitely make again.

I thought this was delicious.  I used Aidells Turkey Sausage w/garlic and artichoke.  Sauteed it with 2 garlic cloves and onion.  Added chicken broth, diced tomatoes, 5 red potatoes, carrots and celery.  Threw in zucchini, cannellini beans with the spinach at the end and then added ditalini (cooked separately).  I never added the salt, it didn't need it.

I bought premade Italian sausage meatballs began browning and them cut in halves. I added one extra can of beef broth 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic salt, 1/2tsp salt instead of recipe and 1/2tsp pepper instead of recipe and 1 1/2 extra cups of spinach. Be sure to taste along each addition of ingredients. This fed about 15 portions.

As all the other reviewers mentioned, this is a simple, yet hearty base recipe upon which to build a great soup!  I added 5 garlic cloves, a large shallot, doubled the stewed tomatoes and included 1 can of tomato bisque soup.  I also took another reviewer's suggestion and ad

This is a tasty recipe, and easy to prepare. I did saute a small onion to add, and added about 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. Based on other reviews,  I omitted the salt, but felt it needed a touch of salt at the table.

So, true story... I didn't know I was making this soup until it was almost done.  I mean, I looked at the ingredients, bought everything I would need, looked at my rating from the "last time" and started cooking.  Well, I thought I was making Italian Tortellini Soup, and when I clicked back and forth between my last rating and the recipe, it finally occurred to me, "what am I making?"  I panicked for a second when I thought I wasn't following any recipe at all!  Nonetheless, I finished cooking and tried the soup.  For now I'm going to give it three stars, because I'm sure I messed something up along the way.  As far as I know, I  cooked the recipe as called for, but omitted the beans (since I didn't recall using beans the "previous" time I had cooked this), and added an 8oz can of tomato sauce.  I used hot Italian sausage and frozen spinach.  I also added just a little celery.  I containered and froze most of what I made and kept a little for lunch tomorrow.  We'll see how it heats up after sitting for a day.  For now, I'll say it was ok but I'm not sure I'll make it again.

This is simply delicious and perfect on a cold winter day.  I used hot and mild sausage to give it an extra kick.

Loved all the flavors and textures.  Made it exactly to the recipe and doubled the batch.  Was going to freeze it but gave away a bit.  Out of the seven people no negatives!  Will make again and use hot Italian

I browned the sausage and a small minced onion in a tiny bit of olive oil to prevent sticking. I then added the garlic as to not to burn it.

To make this recipe Pescatarian friendly, I used spicy seafood sausage and vegetable broth. All other ingredients were the same as the original recipe. It was amazing and everyone loved it.

This soup is AMAZING. Everyone in my family loved it. It's so full of flavor. I added red potatoes in mine and would recommend adding an extra can of beans if you like your soup a little more hearty.

This soup is not only delicious but easy to make.  I took it to a soup cook-off contest at work and won first prize!  It is great  for those cool fall days.  The only slight modification is I use low sodium broth.  Also, I found the Johsonville sweet Italian sausage is our favorite for this recipe.

I added rotini pasta to mine, and served it with Ritz crackers & peanut butter & jelly sandwiches (as I do with any soup) to make a full course meal. I was skeptical whether or not my 14-yr old son would eat it because of all the vegetables, but to my surprise my entire family absolutely loved it so much...the pot's almost empty! It's great when you can cook a meal that not only provide an array of healthy ingredients, but that's enjoyable to the whole family as well

very good. I used half sausage and half tvp to reduce the fat. the tvp took on the flavor  of the sausage and my carnivore friends had no idea!  I loved all of the veggies and I added  hot sauce for a bit of a kick

Saved my butt, this did! Low on funds and had to find some spare parts to make a dish, happened to have everything but the carrots and tomatoes, did a little substitution, but regardless it turned out extraordinary! Thanks for the recipe!

A true staple in our house!  I usually omit the tomatoes and use 1/2 chicken stock and half 1/2 beef stock.  I increase the carrots to 2 cups and throw in 1/2 cup of cooked orzo pasta.  I sometimes add a cup of cooked tortellini pasta instead.  Beautiful with warmed cheese buns.

We thought this was great.  Used one lb of regular Italian sausage and one pound of hot.  Used kale instead of spinach. Fresh tomatoes from the garden and some tomato paste, and butter beans. Really good.

My family loved this soup. I normally have mixed reviews when I make soup but they all liked it. I made it in the crockpot and modified a few of the items as to what I had on hand. I used farmer sausage and cooked it in pieces before adding to the crockpot. I didn't have spinach so I used Swiss card cut up. I also added basil and oregano.

This soup was fantastic! I played around with it a little and added chopped mushrooms, 5 gloves of garlic 2 beef cubes for flavor, one small onion which i cooked with the sausage and i cooked some orzo pasta and tossed that in (about a cup cooked). We sprinkled with shredded parm. I also served this with fresh baked french bread. YUM!!

I love this recipe! It's great as is but is also very versatile. I like to use hot Italian sausage and a Tbl of fennel seeds. When I'm feeling under the weather I add a Tbl or so of chilli flakes. Thanks submitting this recipe. It's definitely a go to

OMG...I haven't put the spinach or beans in and my husband is standing there eating out of the pot! I changed this up only by adding chopped pork tenderloin with the Italian turkey sausage and onions. OUTSTANDING says the man with his mouth full! Now excuse me while I take the spoon out of his hand so I can finish this.

The only thing I did differently was omit the salt completely, because of the amount of broth it asked for, (all that sodium!) and I added more spinach. By how much? As much as I thought would be proportionate to the amount of  soup. I thought it smelled different? and was a little nervous but it tasted great. It may be because I've never cooked with beef broth. =) I had Imperial crackers with it. Perfection! This recipe was enough for 6  good sized servings.

I used hot Italian turkey sausage.  Added an onion and a little garlic powder and minced garlic.  This was probably one of the best soups I have ever made.  Served with angel hair pasta. Next time I might add a little kernel corn and parm to top.  Will definitely make again.

I LOVE this soup. This recipe is a great base. I usually throw in whatever veggies I have on hand, and I always use hot sausage. Great topped with parm or sour cream.

Fast and yummy to make!
SUGGESTION:
I like to use half chicken broth and half beef broth then to make healthier use chicken or turkey Italian sausage mixing half sweet Italian  sausages and half spicy giving this soup great flavor.

This is simply fabulous soup! I've barely changed it at all, and made it so many times I can't count them. I thought it time to add my review in praise of it! Even my picky seven year old thinks it is fantastic, and one of his favorite meals.  I use mild italian sausage, and definitely don't add the salt. It simply isn't necessary. We like to sprinkle parmesan cheese on top, or add tortellini every once in a while if we have it.  I cannot recommend this crowd pleaser enough!

I made this using some of the most popular edits from the reviews, and I wish that I hadn't. I would have liked it better the original recipe. Particularly, I felt that the extra broth made it less flavorful, and I didn't like the extra tomatoes. Next time I may add another can of beans though. Also, the skin on the links ended up kind of tough and gross, so I think I'll use ground sausage next time.

This recipe is great as is, alot of flavor. I do like to play with this one. I use hot sausage for that little kick, extra garlic and sometimes orzo pasta. I have found i like kale instead of spinich it has great flavor and doesn't wilt as much.  I also add extra broth and leave out the salt. Thanks for the recipe

Great soup! Everything came out perfectly. The soup was a little salty and greasy. If I were to do it again, I would drain most of the sausage grease first before continuing. Otherwise it was great?

One star taken away because it was very salty. I made this soup exactly as written. I used turkey Italian sausage and dry beans, so that was the only difference.  I didn't add the liquid from the canned beans because I didn't have any.  .  I didn't buy salt-free beef broth or salt free tomatoes, but I will the next time.  I would not change a thing. My husband just raved about it.  Filling and fairly nutritious.  If I use salt-free broth the next time, I may had some bay leaf, oregano or even some fennel seeds for flavor.  I'd rather  season it that way instead of with tons of salt.....and I like salt.

Very easy to make and has great flavor.  I loved the variety of vegetables.  The Italian sausage does make it pretty spicy, so if you don't want it quite so spicy, perhaps you could try 1/2 lb. Italian and 1/2 lb. regular sausage.

I made a double batch for my family of seven and they devoured it. My hubby ate three servings and raved all throughout diner. Oh, and I actually cooked this in my Instant Pot (pressure cooker). I sautéed the sausage right in the IP, then just added everything else. 35 minutes later, YUM!

I made the recipe last night and it was amazing. Super easy to make and full of flavor.  I made it exactly as is except I didn't add the salt and pepper because the sausage and Italian style tomatoes have enough.  Could easily be low carb if you omit the beans but personally, the beans don't hurt too much and gives it a nice flavor. Will totally make this again soon.

Just unbelievably good. I make it exactly as written and everyone always loves it. I use half a pound mild Italian ND half a pound hit Italian sausage.  all mild is lacking just a little something and all hit is a little too hot for my taste. It's cooking now and smells absolutely delicious.

I added 16 oz. (1can beef broth), 1/2 cup carrots, 1 zucchini, 1 can stewed Italian stewed tomatoes, an onion (chopped at the beginning,  2 cloves of garlic,  and 1 cup egg noodles (no yolks) to the ingredients listed on this recipe.  I cooked the Italian Sausage (Hot) on a George Foreman and then sliced and cut each piece in fourths.  My husband and I loved it!  Very tasty!  Thanks!

I make this all the time. Great for sneaking vegetables into my husband's diet. I always add an onion and use thawed (and squeezed) frozen spinach. Lately I'be been throwing in some nutmeg, because why not?

I've made this dozens of times and it has become my favorite cold weather soup.  I use hot Italian turkey sausage to make it lighter, add quartered red potatoes,  fired roasted diced tomatoes instead of stewed, half beef/half chicken stock, and serve it with Italian bread and shredded parmesan cheese.  It is just so good!

I love this recipe, very easy to make and most of the ingredients are household staples. (plus sausage holds a long time). 
My only regret was not chopping everything up smaller, but hey - that's what blenders are for.

Delicious soup and and super easy and quick to make.   A great go to dinner if pressed for time.  We have a little 'rate' the meal discussion when a new meal is made and everyone gave this a 10.

Great recipe!  Just some suggestions, all optional, to those who want to add them.  Great Northern beans are a great choice, but change them up with Cannellini (White Kidney Beans),  or Garbanzo.  I also added 1 Cup sliced celery, as well as 1 small diced onion, and 1 Cup of sliced fresh mushrooms.  I saute'ed the the onions and mushrooms when the sausage was almost done cooking, cooked it for an additional 5 min, then added the garlic during the last minute of cooking time.  The celery I added with the carrots.  I also added 1 tsp of lemon   pepper to brighten the flavor of the soup.  I'm going to be making this soup again, for sure!!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I make this at least twice a month. It is sooo tasty. very flavorful. They only change I've made is using regular breakfast sausage instead of Italian sausage. So if you're not an Italian sausage fan you can still enjoy this soup! Some tasty options to add as sides or condiments: my fiancé loves to put sour cream in his, I like to add Feta cheese to mine and sometimes we split an avocado as a side. I don't know why but they really go together well. Another thing I like about this dish is the zuchinni. It has a potato like texture but it's not starchy so for the ones that like the tradition of potatoes in your stew you have that sort of fix.

Best winter soup ever! I sometimes sub chopped kale instead of spiniach, I usually double recipe for my family but only use 1 can northern beans, and keep Kale or Spiniach to 2-3 cups depending on mood. If using Kale, throw in with Zucchini and let cook together longer. Add parmesean shavings when served...with bread. YUMMY!!

Made this last night, and now I'm currently eating leftovers, and this is AMAZING. The only changes I made was adding a good pinch of red pepper flakes, since our store was out of hot italian sausages, I had to use mild, and I added some basic seasonings (italian seasoning, pinch of basil & oregano, garlic powder.) Also added some tomato paste and 2 cans of beans instead of one. Anytime I make a tomato-ish dish I always add a small pinch of sugar, and it helped balance all the savory that was going on. This soup has amazing flavor, not to mention how fast and easy it was. I'm 19, and I'm the main cook in my family, since I enjoy it so much and my brother isn't crazy about a lot of vegetables, and my mom isn't crazy about a lot of meat, but they both really enjoyed this. Definitely going on meal rotation, and I can't wait to make a big batch in the summer with fresh in season vegetables and freeze it for the winter. This recipe is a 11/10!!

This is an excellent winter comfort soup. Great broth. Subbed tortellini for beans (wife can't eat beans). Other than that, exactly to the recipe.  Will be making on a regularly.

So easy and delicious.  I too, read the helpful reviews and made some small additions (potato, cup of cooked noodles, more garlic) and didn't add salt.  So  good.  I just helped myself to seconds.

I made this and it passed the ultimate test, my Italian husband. He did say that the addition of soup pasta would be good, but he is diabetic and it is better for him just like it is. Would I make it again, definitely!

I added an orange pepper because I wanted to use it up.  I think I'd use petite dice tomatoes next time, the stewed ones I bought were in fat slices.  This is a perfect one pot winter meal!

This is delicious!  I added 1 more can of beef broth & 1/2 C. chopped celery,  Penzey's Italian seasoning & 1 more clove of garlic.  I substituted the great Northern beans for Cannellini beans (much more Italian).  I cut the carrots, zucchini and celery in chunks rather than slices to give it a heartier bite.  It's a keeper for my recipe file.

Soooo "souper" good! I added some yellow squash for color and a little bit of onion. I did not add salt and I am glad because the ingredients provide just enough. I finished the bowl with fresh ground pepper and grated parmesan....There just are no word for how good this is! Ate two bowls!!!

This was great! Everyone in the family loved it! I made it as the recipe called but I think next time I'll add pasta and use reduced salt for the stock.  It's defiantly going in my rotation.

I love to try new recipes and get discouraged when a 5 star recipe isn't very good.  This one is excellent and easy!  I was not disappointed and will add to our rotation.  I used chicken sausage and it turned out perfect!

No pasta or potatoes...so good for carb counters.   Used a small can of sliced carrots (and held the added salt); and that shortened the cooking time.  Also recommend low sodium broth.

Super good. Used 2 cups more broth (used half chicken and half beef), added .5 cup orzo, used frozen spinach, and added some extra italian seasoning. Next time add 3 cups more broth.

My favorite soup. I made it according to the recipe the first time I made it, but have changed it every time since then, just depending on what I had on hand. It turned out great every time! Thank you!

I ended up making this for the first time using some hot and spicy sausage. I added leeks and celery and decided to cut out the zucchini. Yeah, I know I should try recipes first before  I start changing things, but I like to live dangerously. It ended up being delicious and I had enough soup to feed my lonesome self for a good week.

Only problem was I used dried beans instead of beans from a can and they were not cooked enough in the end. Not a problem with the recipe, but with my limited skills. Still even with not-quite-done beans, the soup was delicious and I will definitely make it again sometime.

This soup is extremely forgiving & you can add or subtract almost any ingredient. I think many of you are missing the boat by not using kale as it is awesome in soup & little ones won't know the difference. :)

I like it better using  Zuchinni and or Summer Squash instead of carrots and hot Italian sausage to give it some kick. I add a bit of fresh or dried basil and topping it with Parmesean cheese.

Great recipe, just a tip when using fresh spinach.  When ready to serve, tear/chop you spinach and add to your bowl.   Then pour your soup over top.    

Another alternative is to use rappini over the spinach.

I made this yesterday and it was SO good! Perfect for a chilly, lazy night. I doubled the beans and spinach and I think added another clove of garlic. Once I added the zucchini I only simmered for 5 minutes because I wanted maintain the texture. I also added a generous amount of cilantro to dress it in the bowl. YUM!

I love this easy quick recipe. Sometimes I add different fresh veggies whatever I have on hand. This is also an easy recipe for a crockpot. Just sautée garlic and sausage and then put in crockpot. Add all the remaining ingredients except spinach. Set on high for 4-6 hours add spinach 5 minutes before serving. Easy make ahead recipe.

I cannot get enough of this soup, so good!  I've tried different sausages, sometimes a mild/hot mix and sometimes a ground/cubed sausage mix.  Any variation of ingredients I've tried have always come out with great results.  This is a versatile and tasty recipe you have here, exploding with flavor!

Made the soup exactly as it described and my family loved it. Next time we will try a low sodium beef broth or a chicken sausage and see how it works. The longer you cook the sausage in the beginning, the better it will be in the soup. Also, be liberal with the spinach. I could have used double my amount.

I used 2 cans of Stewed tomatoes and a 24 oz box of beef broth. I doubled all the vegetables but not the garlic. I love this soup, its a regular at our house.

I did make two modifications.   I used 1 pkg of frozen spinach rather than the fresh, although either would have worked well.  I also cooked up about a half pound of tortellini when it was almost done, drained, and added it in the last minute.  It was absolutely delicious, and I will make it again... probably next week.Make it.  You won't be sorry.

My family calls this pizza soup and it's easy to make it vegan! It's a great recipe as is or with onions, bell pepper, mushrooms, kale... perfect for a cool early fall dinner,  when we still have fresh zucchini and tomatoes.

Made it for dinner tonight, exactly as the recipe stated.  It's just delicious.  Filling, easy, and it goes together quick enough that it doesn't overheat the kitchen.    This is going to be a keeper!

Added  1 chicken bullion cube, added one potato chopped, onion, added one hot sausage and two sweet, no salt,  2 cloves of Garlic, nice buttery toasted Chabata bread, poured soup  over brown rice. Think next time I will try rolling the sausage into balls. The potato was nice .

The only changes I made were to add a chopped onion and 1 C of cooked, rinsed Orzo at the very end. If u like it a little spicy, add more pepper.  It tastes great with some grated Parmesan cheese too. but it's very tasty without.

Excellent! I really hate zucchini so I substituted mushrooms and also added half an onion because I love them. This is my favorite soup I've ever made and I've made a ton. Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

Great soup! I followed the instructions, but I did add a can of cannellini beans, a half of a medium onion. I would suggest draining your sausage well with paper towel in a colander to ensure you get most of the grease out to avoid a grease slick soup. Give it a try it so worth it.

Versatile, tasty soup. Made many times, often with subs, like chicken stock, not beef, one link of a flavorful sausage (as from Sprouts) and a half pound fresh grnd beef, different beans that I have on hand, always with lots of spinach. To round out the deep, sultry flavor, I add a 1/4th to 1/2 stick of butter...zowies. Some recipes include Parmesan cheese as a garnish...yummy, but not needed, if you are (ahem...) watching extra calories.

This soup sounded so good I just had to try it.  Although I don't care for Zucchini, I made the soup exactly by the recipe. My husband and I loved it.  I am sending it to my kids to try.

This soup makes for a wonderful cool season meal.  The flavors are great together and I usually double the recipe to make a batch for the freezer.  When I double, I will use three cans of the beans and puree one of the three.  This makes the soup a bit thicker though it is great also without the puree.

It's was the BOMB!  Next time I'll use mild sausage as it was a little too hot for hubby. Served it with crusty bread and a glass of wine!

This Soup Is So good. I did make a few changes I used chicken broth instead of beef and I used frozen chopped spinach and I used 2 hot sausage links to .  did not add zucchini.  It is so yummy. I will make again.

Made this soup last night for supper and it was wonderful. My husband commented several times how good it was.   I doubled the recipe so that I could freeze some for later and other than that, the only changes from the original recipe I made were omitting the salt and being a little heavy handed on the garlic.  Eating the soup alone, it could have used a little salt but it was fine without.  (Not knowing how salty my sausage was, I didn't want to overdo it and could add it at the end, if necessary.) Since we typically eat soup with crackers, we didn't need additional salt.  Changes I would make the next time I make it:  add more beans or pasta.  We like a thick, hearty soup and additional beans or pasta would thicken it up a bit.   If I have extra spinach, I will add it.  Not that it needed more, but anytime I can add more greens is a bonus.  We like our foods spicy and considered using half sweet Italian sausage/half hot Italian sausage, but I'm not a huge hot Italian sausage fan.  May try adding a little cayenne the next time...but it is delicious as is!  Great recipe!

I made this exactly as directed. I found it good but not excellent. I recommend using a little hot sausage to give it more zing.

Didn't change a thing! Super quick and easy to make. It was family friendly with my low-carb diet. I just didn't eat the carrots and beans to limit my carbs.

I love soups, in fact, it's about the only thing that I can make and everyone likes the recipes.  This is the ABSOLUTE BEST!!   The first two times, I made as listed, but the last pot I used Beef Stock; what a difference!  Much richer.  I also like my soups soupy so I then also added a carton of Beef Broth.   Sissy1221

This "Italian Sausage Soup" is the perfect comfort food: very delicious broth loaded with Italian sausage, orange round carrot slices, white zucchini cubes, dark green pieces of spinach, and cream-colored beans. I made mine with homemade chicken stock (instead of beef broth) because I took it out of the freezer by mistake. I also used "Italian White Spagna Beans" (instead of Great Northern Beans) because that is all I could find at the Italian grocery store, and they look like the same thing to me. I could not bring myself to put the bean liquid from the can into the soup. The next time I make this soup I will prepare the vegetables in advance because this soup comes together very fast (good for a busy day). Also, I will use precooked Italian sausage pieces from the freezer since I always have them on hand (usually for quick breakfasts). I will certainly make this recipe again many, many more times. Thank you SALLYJUN for sharing your recipe.

My husband's exact words, "This is THE best soup ever!"  I am considered a great cook and even have a recipe book of my own in process. We love soups, especially in the winter, and I like trying new recipes.  This one was "over the top."  I threw in one cup of cleaned and washed lentils that I had in the pantry and had to increase the liquid to 48 oz. (I used organic beef broth). We liked that little tweak.  Like another reviewer, I'd give it six stars if it were an option.  Thank you Sallyjun and allrecipes.com!!!

Outstanding. The boys gobbled it up and I dreamt about it as a leftover only to find my wife had polished it off by the time I got home. Used more sausage with Tuscan spice.

Very good, I even got my son to eat it and that was a huge surprise!!! I cut the tomatoes up small before adding them, because stewed tomatoes are too large straight from the can. But I used all the ingredients and didn't change the recipe at all. It was very tasty!

Excellent soup for anytime but is super on a cold winter day.  I made my own Italian sausage from Sweet Italian sausage recipe on this website.  I use frozen zucchini and yellow squash.  I prefer to use my own canned tomatoes from the garden in order to reduce the amount of sodium.  My husband raves about this soup.

This is a winner in our kitchen! My boyfriend loved it! I really liked it, but have to admit I'm not keen on the fennel seed in Italian sausage so I didn't eat the meat. I made changes to suit what we had on hand, but I'm certain it would have been just as good as instructed. Changes: added broccoli (in place of zucchini) and potatoes( which absorbed the flavor magnificently!!)I added a cup of beef broth-- all my broth was from bouillion cubes and I have to admit I wish I'd had the low sodium.. Other than that I cooked as is and it will be a staple from now on!

This is the second time I have made it, such a great soup.  This time I used chick peas because I found the white beans got mushy.  Also added onions and a bit of pasta, and some Italian spice.,  Did not add salt or pepper as I found it did not need it.

This was delicious and a hit at our New Year's Eve Italian Feast! I used 1 pound of Spicy Italian ground sausage and 1/2 pound of mild ground Italian sausage. I also added 3 extra carrots, one more cup of spinach leaves, and a can of garbanzo beans. I will definitely make this soup again!

I enjoyed this soup fresh, but it didn't keep well. Normally I love left overs, but the spinach particularly was not good . I will still make this again, the broth was very tasty!

I subbed escarole in place of the spinach, but I think next time I'll just stick to the spinach as the escarole got kind of gooey. I also subbed chicken broth in for the beef broth and I really liked this substitution! Very hearty soup with slit of veggies. I'll make again.

Just wow, so easy and so hearty. I love garlic so I used 5 cloves, haha. I followed the directions to the letter for the rest, all fresh veggies, and I bought sweet Italian sausage from the deli counter. I forgot to buy it, but I think garnishing with fresh parmesan cheese would be delightful :-) I plan to make this again and again and again.

This soup was delicious and easy to make.  There was no spinach at the store so I used red chard.  I doubt you could tell the difference. This is a good main dish.

This was so good!  I did change a few things for my preferences.  I added additional garlic powder, a couple splashes of red wine, 1 more can of broth, and a can of kidney beans. My 7 year old ate 3 bowls!

I don't usually comment on here but this soup was wonderful!  I was surprised to like it so much.  I made the recipe exactly but for one extra clove of garlic (garlic lover!). I will definitely make this soup again.  It's so easy to make.

Excellent Soup!!!  We made it today. Used one can of French Onion and one beef broth and two cloves of minced garlic. Didn't need to add salt. Also used Italian diced tomatoes instead of Italian Stewed. This is a great flavor filled soup!??

I followed the recipe to a "t". This soup was fantastic. It will definitely be a favourite in our house. The sausage I used was gluten free (naturally), as well as the beef broth (Campbell's), so this was a perfect gluten-free soup for my Celiac husband!

Fabulous soup, perfect for a cold winter day.  Like others, I doubled the stewed tomatoes, added a can of chicken broth and used both mild and hot sausage.  Very, very flavorful!

I made this for dinner when visiting the East Coast and there was a little snow on the ground and the temp around 28. So not Bay Area weather. My first time I made it as the recipe required but changed the stock to low sodium chicken. It only served 3 people because we each had seconds ;-)

I added half an onion which is the only addition I made. I used unsalted beef stock and a mix of hot and mild sausage which needed no additional salt. Delicious and plenty salty.

Made this soup after having seen the recipe yesterday.  I made a change in that I used hot poultry sausage and vegetable broth.  It came out great and definitely deserve five stars.
My wife immediately suggested we serve it at a family gathering next weekend and that time I will try a mild sausage.

This was an excellent soup.  I added onion & celery too.  I used a combination of hot & mild sausage.  I used more salt than recommended, as my broth was salt free. thanks will be making this soup often!

This was easy to make and it was good. Substituted carrots with potatoes and added onions. Also used Italian sausage links instead of ground Italian sausage... This was easy and perfect for a cold day.

Talk about a great tasting recipe...and so easy to put together to boot!  It took no time at all to cook.  My hubby and I loved it!  (I only had hot Italian sausage on hand...we like spicy, but the hot sausage gave it just a little "zip", not overpowering).  It was perfect for a cold winter night...very filling, and I served homemade garlic bread with it.

Excellent!  My go-to recipe.  I do add some Sweet Italian sausage and some Hot Rotel for a little kick.

I gave this recipe a five because it was the best tasteing sausage soup I ever made for my customer. They loved it. I made a few changes to it like instead of beef stock I used chicken stock and I added cherry tomatoes

I love this recipe. I add one extra can of chicken broth per other reviews. A sometimes add extra beans and zucchini just because I like it that way but recipe is good as is! This has become a staple in my home.

This soup is awesome!  I fixed it during the Thanksgiving holiday when family was in town.  Everyone raved about it and it was super easy to make.  For those with a King Soopers nearby, I got their 18 oz. package of spicy Italian sausage and used the whole package.  I also used an entire 32 oz. box of organic beef broth (my sister is big on organic stuff).  Cutting the zucchini in chunks keeps them from getting too mushy.  My brother-in-law who likes things spicy and always adds cayenne to everything said the spice from the sausage was just right.  Last night, I made the soup again with left over chicken broth, wilting spinach, and half a package of spicy sausage.  It still came out great! It's the kind of soup that you can really improvise as long as you have good tasting sausage.  Next time I think I will try kale.

Discovered the recipe this morning, purchased the ingredients this afternoon, cooked it this evening. Made per instructed, changed nothing. If you like flavor...this is a soup for you! This was fantastic! My wife said it had a good kick (a bit too spicy for her, but I might have used an Italian sausage that was too spicy). I absolutely loved it! Full of flavor and delicious vegetables! I LOVE soups and this has become one of my favorites immediately! Thank you for posting it! I will definitely be cooking this often!

This will be a definite once a month recipe in my household! I use med hot Italian sausage from my butcher shop, low sodium beef broth and no additional salt.  My husband and I ate the leftovers the next day and are ready for another batch.  Thank you for this new household favorite.

This recipe reminds me of a soup at Olive garden. :-)
 I put my own spin on it.  I added the leftover string beans I had from the night before. Extra broth ( chicken) and used hot chicken sausage instead of pork and also two small red potatoes diced.  This is a very hearty soup. Served with salad and French bread,  it made a great Sunday meal.

I have made this several times and absolutely love it.  It is definitely a great fall/winter soup.  Tastes great after sitting for a couple of days as well.  This is in my recipe rotation!

This is a wonderful, hearty soup.  I did add a half onion and stalk of celery, and used a box of broth. I made orzo and put it at the bottom of each serving which I liked for the added texture, but the soup stands well without it.

I couldn't find the spinach but didn't really need it - it was good even without it. I threw in some orzo when I added the beans/zucchini. Because I had mild sausage and was afraid it might need a little kick, I threw in a pinch of Chipolte pepper seasoning but actually don't think it needed it because it was already nicely flavored. I did not add any salt. Will make again! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I made a few additions to incorporate some veggies I already had in my refrigerator.  I used sweet Italian turkey sausage, added 1/2 an onion, 1 small yellow squash, 1 rib of celery, 1/2 of a turnip - cubed, used 6 cloves of garlic, added in some water (1 broth can ) and a beef bullion cube, and seasoned with onion flakes, garlic flakes, and Italian seasoning in addition to the salt and pepper.  I simmered the soup on low for about 5 hours and served it over cooked salad macaroni (ditalini).  I'll be making this recipe for years to come!

love this recipe, used all hot sausage, omitted beans but added potatoes.  It is delicious, making for the second time in a little over 2 weeks!  We serve ours with olive oil on baguette bread!

So I was looking for a new soup recipe and stumbled across this one - and I'm so glad I did!!!!  I followed the recipe , the only difference was I accidently picked chicken broth instead of beef,  but it still came your tasting fantastic!  I used my rasp grater and grated some Asiago cheese on top.  Talk about heavenly!!!!!! Wonderful recipe thanks for sharing!

This is so simple, and so good! I am impressed. The only thing I did differently was add 1/2 onion to the saute in the beginning. I should have doubled the recipe because its all gone already!

I made this soup last minute for my boyfriend who was feeling under the weather! I did half hot sausage, half regular and I added broken fettucini noodles with the beans and zucchini as that's all I had. It was raved about and the entire house smelled great! Will definitely be making again. Thank you.

I made waaaaaay too much, but I'm not even upset at that. I absolutely love leftovers, and the fact that there's a whole pot still left of this soup makes me happy. I added a 4 garlic cloves instead and frozen chopped spinach. My kids devoured it. Thanks.

This is the perfect soup for summer!  And really all year.  I've added extra veggies every time (radishes and other root vegetables really bulk it up).   I've made it, subbed kale for spinach when that's what's we had on hand, and used black beans if we're out of white.  It's always a hit - and my 2.5 year old will eat all the veggies!  (She demands more radishes!)

This is my favorite winter time dinner! The only thing I do different is add potatoes and I use diced tomatoes (that has basil, garlic and oregano) because I do not like big chunks of tomatoes in my soup. Otherwise I follow the recipe!y kids 4 and 6 love it too! They call it strong soup ??

I think next time, i will try this with kale instead of spinach, just because I think the firm texture would go great with this soup. But as is, it's so amazing, and so easy.

The only thing it changed is using a leek along with the onions. I feel it made it even more hearty than this soup already is. I added this to my recipe book to pass down to the kids when they grow up. Fantastic!

Very good, easy to prepare, the sausage gave it alot of flavor, although I did add a little Italian seasoning, just because I'm old school; but liked it very much, served over pasta with parmesan cheese and garlic bread.  Definitely making this one again, thanks for posting!!

This soup is so delicious!  Oh my gosh! 
I changed a few things because i didn't have some of the ingredients but it was good anyway. I also added rice because why not. Bomb dot com. Seriously.  Thank you.

Excellent with these changes based on other reviews.  Added extra garlic, added onions, 1/2 cup orzo pasta instead of beans.  I used stewed tomatoes but next time will get diced instead.

This is my first review and I have used this site for a very, very long time.  Italian Sausage Soup has become one of my 'go to' recipes that I know everyone will love.  It takes a little bit of time chopping, but besides that it is easy, pretty healthy and DELICIOUS.  Thank you!

We love this soup! Once I used breakfast sausage because that's what I had on hand. Big mistake! It ruined it. Make sure you follow the recipe and use Italian sausage -- sweet or spicy.

Awesome!!!  Such a great tasting soup and very filling.

I made a quicker & low carb version: leave out beans, zucchini and carrots for less sugar & carbs.

This was great!  I chopped up small white potatoes into small cubes and added them at the same time as the Northern Beans.  Also I substituted celery for the zucchini.  I had frozen spinach and used that.  It made a big batch, I'll put some in the freezer and pull it out when I don't feel like cooking in a few weeks.  :-)

So delicious.  Even living in the state of Florida I make a big pot of soup a couple times a month.  We are only two so I freeze some and give some to my neighbors.  Rave reviews.  So hearty and with great blending flavors.  It's a keeper!

Family favorite! I make this a lot during the winter. I omit the beans, add onion, cooked tortellini(at the end) cilantro(also at the end), pepper flakes and Parmesan cheese. Serve with warm french bread and butter.

This is a great recipe!! I took the advice from some other reviewers and tweaked a bit of the ingredients around to round out the flavors. I added one chopped onion, 1 cubed red potato, about 1 tsp oregano, increased the garlic from 1 to 3 cloves, added a bit of ditalini at the end, changed the broth to 32 oz of beef stock, cut out the salt, and used half sweet, half hot sausage. I would recommend using all hot sausage as that had the best flavor and using diced tomatoes rather than the stewed tomatoes. The spinach and zucchini are great additions to this recipe and it's really a keeper!

Delicious!  The nice thing about this is that you can tweak it as you like.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I added some chopped celery along with the garlic when I browned the sausage.  I chopped the canned stewed tomatoes so my tomato chunks wouldn't be so big (but I still added all the liquid from the can).  When I added the spinach at the end, I also added about 2 cups of cooked ditalini pasta.  For that reason, there wasn't quite enough broth, so I had to add more.  The flavor from the sausage and the italian-style tomatoes was plenty of seasoning for us.  I did not add any salt or pepper - not needed.  I recommend waiting until it's done and tasting it before you add salt - mine was plenty salty without adding more.  Next time I would drain the fat after browning the sausage; I don't think it would detract from the flavor but would reduce the fat content.  I served with parmesan to sprinkle on top and warm rolls right out of the oven and everyone in our family of 6 liked it!

Just spectacular - and so easy.    I used all sweet Italian since I wasn't sure my kids would go for spicy.  I doubled recipe and added 1/2 cup barley - awesome.    Also used pinto beans iinstead of Great Northern.    I did add about 36 oz extra beef broth - but that may be because of the barley and extra zuchinni I had added.    I will definitely make this again.

Easy, healthy and yummy!  What could be better?  I also doubled the garlic, added a chopped onion, some more sausage (because my husband loves it), used chicken and turkey sausages to be healthier, and added some more tomatoes.  Also used frozen spinach and doubled the recipe overall.

This was the best soup I have had in a long while. Was proud to serve this for dinner.  I used 1LB of sweet italian sausage, replaced great northern beans with Canelli Beans (white kidney bean) added 1c of small shell pasta, because of the additon of the pasta I did add a third can of broth. I followed the advice of others and used low sodium broth and didn't add the additional 1/4tsp. Served this with very toasty garlic bread cut into strips for dipping. Next time will garnish with croutons and parm cheese. This is a great recipe and I enjoyed both cooking and eating this soup. Thanks

This is a fabulous base to add your own tastes to! I add cheese tortellini and two kinds of beans. Also tomato sauce for richness.

I'm one of  those people who "tweak" recipes but I made this one pretty much as written except I substituted acini de pepe  pasta for the great northern beans and added some tomatoes.   I have made this several times and love it!

This was excellent! We used spicy Italian sausage and followed the recipe to a T.  My only advice would be to only add salt at the very end and taste it to determine whether you need to add any at all.  Our soup ended up way too salty, there was probably a lot in the sausage to start with.

My family loved this recipe!  I substituted dried spices for fresh, left out zucchini (had none on hand) but added fresh celery instead.  A meal on it's own, served it up with some fresh semolina bread.  Hearty and flavorful.

pretty good...but nothing special.  Wished there were pasta in it.  Suggest adding zucchini just for a few minutes so it stays bright green and not soggy.

Delicious!!  It didn't look all that yummy but the taste said it all.  I took the advice of some and didn't add salt and used hot as well as sweet sausage, which gave it a nice bite, plus added two cloves of garlic instead of one.  Next time I want to try adding a little pasta.  It was even better the next day.  This is a keeper recipe, in fact we're having an Italian group get-together in a couple of weeks and we'll be taking this soup.

Wow this was good! I used a box of frozen chopped spinach and added 4 cups of water for more broth. Also I threw in some left over peas and corn from the night before and some ditalini pasta. Awesome flavor.  I highly recommend this.

Awesome soup!! After reading other reviews I used 1/2 lb. spicy sausage and 1/2 lb. turkey sausage, added 1/2 c. orzo rice, and used 1 pkg. frozen spinach. And I used 1 can lentils instead of navy beans. Definitely one of my new favs!!

This soup is much better than you even think it will be - and it's quick and easy!  I followed the recipe exactly (makes me crazy when people review a recipe that they've completely changed) except I may have splashed in a bit of the red wine I was drinking while I cooked

This was a really good base recipe. I love hearty soups, so I added some extra oomph by adding cubed potatoes (during the cooking time of the beans and zucchini) as well adding 1 Cup dry uncooked orzo (at the same time of the potatoes). I had chicken broth, so I used that instead. I added an extra can since I added starch from potatoes and pasta. I wasn't sure if I would like it, since it has sausage in it, but I even loved it. I'm going to keep this in my keeper book for the future. The good thing about a recipe like this, is you can adapt it to your taste. I bet kale or cabbage would taste excellent in place of the spinach.

So yummy! I use kale instead of spinach, and usually throw in a bay leaf and some onions at the beginning, but overall, I love this recipe. So yummy! A winter staple in our house.

Great soup!  Used fresh carrots, doubled the broth (50% less sodium) and a whole bag of Dole Baby Spinach. Didn't seem salty enough at first taste but with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese on top made it perfect.

Very tasty soup, perfect for a chilly winter's day. I added some orzo to mine, but unfortunately I must've added a bit too much (1/2 c. uncooked) because it absorbed a lot of the liquid and ended up being more of a stew. Next time, I'd add less, or else cook it before adding. However, the recipe was very tasty as written! I used frozen spinach instead of fresh, I think it would be great either way. It seems like a soup that would be very easy to customize and get creative with.

Great recipe that makes a savory, hearty meal in no time.  I added tiny shell pasta and eliminated the salt because the broth was salty enough.  Definitely will be making this again.

Great soup for a cold day.  Made a double batch (2 lbs of mild sausage but will add a couple of links of hot next time),used chicken broth instead of beef, crushed tomatoes cause that's all I had on hand (added basil and oregano to the soup), extra zucchini, garbonzo beans instead of navy(that's what was in the pantry), and frozen spinach.  I first cooked the sausauge links and then thinly sliced them adding them to the soup with the other vegtables.  Added the spinach after I removed the heat, let sit for 10 minutes, and it was perfect. Served with salad and bread and the family loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

SOOOO Good & very easy. Thanks so much for sharing it! I have never had a soup with Italian Sausage in it. I tweaked a little by adding an extra clove of garlic, an onion & 2 celery stalks. Added some okra too. Didn't use the carrots & tried it without the spinach - delish! Will try spinach next time I make it. Will keep this recipe. So glad I found it!

Quite simply, delicious!  This goes together quite fast.  The results are hearty and savory.  No alterations needed.  Though if you're inclined, the recipe leaves a lot of room for tweaking.  Perfect accompanied by crusty french bread or rolls, and a glass of red wine.

Loved this soup!!  It's our new favorite.  I made it according to the recipe using hot sausage and low sodium broth.  I also left out the salt, thinking we could just add it later.  We didn't need the salt-- this soup had lots of flavor.  I will definitely make this again soon.

This is fantastic. I chopped sausage and browned then ground in FProc. Had no can tomatoes used 2 lg chopped fresh.  Used red kidney beans and 32 oz beef broth low salt and fat.  Added Italian season and used 10 oz pkg fresh spinach.  Served over Penne with Pecorino Romano cheese.

What a great recipe! I used an extra cup of veggie broth and threw in some quinoa, cabbage, and subbed kale for spinach. It turned out amazing! Oh, and I followed other reviewers and used half hot sausage and half regular. Thanks for a quick, scrumptious, and satisfying soup!

I tried this recipe, but made a few changes; I didn't have Zucchini so I used Red Bell Pepper, I also added 5 small potato's chopped into small cubes, 1 small minced onion, a small can of tomato paste, 3 cans of water and a tablespoon of Italian seasoning.  I got a little crazy, and added some chopped up left over meat loaf.  My husband is not a fan of Northern beans, so I added French style green beans.  I served it with Fresh Italian bread.  Absolutely delicious!

Delicious! I didn't use as many beans as it called for since I am not a huge fan of them and used ground Italian sausage. I also did one can chicken and one can beef broth. Will make again

This turned out great! Healthy and delicious. I made the following changes:  • used 2 more cups of broth • added 1 chopped onion • used kidney beans and a squash • added a can of crushed tomatoes • added 2 tsps Italian spices • Added cooked rotini pasta and Parmesan on top at the end. It still could have used a tad more broth for the left over portions.

Not bad. This is a mildly flavored soup but you can add whatever spices you like to suit your tastes. I added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to mine. NOTE: This makes a TON of soup and doesn't really reheat well.... The zucchini turn to mush so keep that in mind if you add it to your soup. All in all, this was decent, but not one of the best recipes for Italian soup on this site. Thanks anyways, SALLYJUN.

Use 3 sweet and 1 or 2 spicy pre-cooked sausages.  Frozen spinach, 1 onion, and 2 potatoes.  Cook all day in the crock pot.

This recipe is excellent. I served this for my boyfriend and his mother and they both loved it! I didn't change anything about the portions, but I did substitute the spinach for kale because I was originally looking for a Portuguese kale soup and this recipe is almost the same as kale soup recipes. I also used sweet-hot Italian sausage from Johnsonville, which added a nice kick. The only criticism I have, which could be easily amended, is that it was a little too salty. I would suggest using low-sodium broth like Blender Woman suggests or eliminating the added salt (or salting to taste). This recipe was also very easy to make. It's going on the regular dinner rotation now!

There's a pot of this soup simmering on the stove right now at my house.  We absolutely love it!  I make the soup in 2 stages. I follow the recipe exactly but stop before adding the zucchini, parsley, and pasta. I cool it in the fridge overnight or for a day or two.  Then I skim off the fat, add the final ingredients and enjoy.  I'm going to make batches for the freezer while the tomatoes are still abundant.

Lovely recipe.  Changes I made were minor. I upped the garlic (I pretty much do that with every recipe that includes it...family preference), added onion, added small pasta shells. Used baby carrots instead of sliced (so I could pick them out easier (But everyone else likes carrots so I can't omit them))

What an outstanding soup! Even though it's summertime, I was in the mood for a really hearty soup last night. The only thing I added was potatoes, and I did go with the suggestion of frozen spinach. Served it with popovers (also from this site) and it was great. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you!

I made this with spicy italian sausage, added an onion while cooking the sausage, twice as many tomatoes,  and 1 cup of orzo along with the zucchini.  Would add a few more cups of broth (total 6 cups) next time as the orzo made it a bit thicker than expected.  It was delicious!

I made the recipe exactly as described with the slight exception of a bit of red pepper flake.  A 10oz package of frozen, chopped spinach was perfect and simplified things even more.  I can't even describe how much I love this soup, one of my all time favorites.

I have made this a couple of times.  The first few times I followed the recipe to the letter and loved it!  But since joining this site, I've become more adventuresome when cooking and decided to personalize it a bit.  So, today, I tripled the garlic, added a couple of hardy splashes of Merlot, and topped it off with Pecorino Romano when served.  My oh my!  It went from great to fabulous!!

I used Italian turkey sausage to save some calories and it was delicious! A serving came out to be just over 200 calories. I served it with homemade dinner rolls, exactly what we were craving on a snowy day. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Used cannellini beans instead of great northern because that is what was in my pantry.  Also added 1 chopped onion.  Turned out great, and the family loved it.

This is an excellent recipe (surprising sweet) that everyone loved.  Its only problem is not enough liquid.  I supplemented using an additional can of tomatoes and some additional broth. Other than adding one medium onion (chopped) in with the sausage, the addition of liquid was the only change I made. This was the first time I've used canned Italian tomatoes and I'm glad I did.  I wasn't sure they were that different from other canned tomatoes, but they were.  In addition to the spices, the tomatoes included tomatoe juice.  I think this helped to make the soup and if you haven't tried it, certainly try in this recipe.

I made this soup with a little less spinach but changed nothing else and it was amazing!!!  Next time I make it I will probably increase the broth by a bit and add all the spinach.....we had 3 people eating it and it was gone!

Wow.  I just made this and I am eating a bowl right now. It is amazing! I doubled the recipe and didn't stray very far, except I used canned diced tomatoes and some italian seasoning in place of the stewed because I didn't have them on hand. I used 1 can each of Northern and Pinto beans, and I cooked and added some farfalle pasta at the end when I added the spinach. Otherwise followed it exactly. I can see how you can improvise like crazy with this wonderful recipe. Thank you, Sallyjun! I am so glad I doubled it, because I'm sure leftovers will be even better!

IF I make this soup again...  I liked the basic ingredients and the ease, but we found it a bit too salty.  I used low
sodium beef broth even, but next time would omit the 1/4 tsp. salt too, and even look for no-salt added stewed tomatoes.  Italian sausage is salty enough.  I'd drain the sausage well before adding the other ingredients, and I'd drain (and rinse) the beans before adding, because I could taste the bean sauce in the soup - don't care for that taste.  I knew hubby would pick out the spinach, so didn't add that.

$15 in ingredients and feeds a family of four for two days?  Yes please!  This recipe is quite delicious and we like to add a 1/4 cup of acini de pepe pasta for a little extra heartiness.

I made this soup last night and it was FANTASTIC! I didn’t think such few ingredients would yield such a flavorful soup but all the reviews made me want to try it! I did add a slight bit of Italian seasoning, orzo, and an onion. It was the best soup I have made at home! So hearty! I served it with warm bread, olive oil with fresh herbs and parmesan cheese. Thanks for an excellent recipe.

This soup is delicious--and healthy.  I make it often during the cold months and everyone who has ever tasted it has asked for the recipe.  The only changes I made are adding more garlic and I do put in fresh mushrooms during the last few minutes of cooking.  The soup is delicious as is; we just happen to love garlic and mushrooms.

Loved this soup.  I leave the spinach out since I'm not sure how that would reheat.  One of our absolute favorites.  Leftovers freeze well and are as good or better than the first day.  Definitely a keeper.

Definitely the perfect meal for a cold winter day!  I made this tonight and only made a few slight changes.  I used 1lb of lean, hot Italian turkey sausage. I removed it from the casing and sauteed it. Because I threw in a half a cup of Ditalini pasta, I added an extra cup of the organic beef stock that I used. I did not add any salt since the stock wasn't low-sodium.  The soup tastes fantastic! The spicy sausage gave the broth such a nice, rich flavor! I will absolutely be making this again.

My family loves this soup.  I have made it many times and it turns out fabulous.  I normally use spicy Italian sausage.  I don't use carrots and I normally use a mixture of pinto and black beans. Instead of stewed tomatoes, I use fresh chopped tomatoes.  This is great recipe because even with substitutions the soup is turns out delicious.

Soup turned out GREAT!
I changed some stuff up.

I browned ground beef and sausage with onions and garlic.

I used 5 cups of beef broth and 3/4 of a can of 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes.

And I added frozen tortellini and frozen spinach.

Too much sausage for me, but it was a healthy, hearty soup and my boyfriend loved it. I do tend to eat more vegetarian though so I am biased.

This soup is fantastic and freezes well. I added extra chicken broth, 1 can whole tomatoes and 1 can crushed tomatoes, frozen spinach instead of fresh, 1 cubed potato. I also used hot italian sausage to give it some kick. Delicious!

I really liked this recipe for the winter months when everyone is getting sick.  Hearty & packed with vitamins.  It's so easy to add any veggies you have handy!  I added half an onion, 3 sweet potatoes, and some elbow macaroni to the 4 zucchini, 1 1/2 lbs of carrots and spinach (the recipe was more than doubled). I added the beef broth and then just water to increase the soup:goodies ratio and reduce the saltiness of the broth.  Half spicy/half mild sausage was great.  The spice from the sausage added enough flavor to the broth that I didn't use any additional salt or pepper.

Made it as written except used pinto beans instead of Great Northern beans because it was what I had on hand.  It was OK but I have liked other homemade soup recipes better so most likely won't make again.

Delicious, a definite keeper. I made my own turkey sausage for this (ground turkey, Italian seasonings, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper) and used chicken broth instead of beef. It was delicious and filling, and the kids liked it (though my oldest managed to dodge almost all of the spinach!). I also sprinkled some fresh Parmesan on each serving. It was served with garlic bread and salad...so good!

I really loved this soup.  I used a mix of spicy chicken sausage and italian sweet sausage from the deli and used garbanzo beans in addition to the great northern beans.  I also used chicken broth and threw in some basil and it tasted great.  Just enough kick from the spicy chicken sausage.  My husband and son loved it!

So yummy!  My husband even loves it and he's pretty picky. Followed the recipe to a tee.  The only thing I added was an extra can of beef broth and a cup of pastini noodles (tiny little star noodles).  Mmmm mmmm good!!

This recipe is amazing and absolutely wonderful.  I used one mexican zucchini and one regular zucchini.  The mexican zucchini is slightly sweeter and stays firmer.

I had to make a few adjustments (otherwise I would have rated 5 stars) but my soup came out delicious! I added diced onion with the sausage and garlic. Next time I might try adding celery as well. I found the soup to be a bit bland so I added some Italian seasoning. I also added some good quality beef base to give it a richer flavor. I cooked elbow macaroni separately and added to each bowl as I served it. I must have it gluten free so that's the easiest way to accommodate myself and my family (they are pasta lovers). Everyone had seconds and it was a huge hit!

Made a double batch and the wind off our lake blew the tupperware pitcher over (I was cooling the soup or refrigerator)....but not before we had had our fill for supper.  Next day I made another double batch and brought half in to work for staff lunch.  Nothing but raves!  Very uncommon with my staff.  I mixed sweet and hot Italian sausage and that seemed to work great.  Also, added some small macaroni..1 cup for double batch.  I left 6 recipe copies out and all were gone by days end.

I omitted the zucchini and it was still delicious! I have made this several times with different kinds of sausage, so use what you like. Also, whether using fresh or frozen spinach, it still comes out terrific!

I have made this recipe several times, and it gets rave reviews from family and friends. I did incorporate some of the suggested changes (1) chicken broth/stock for beef (2) add a potatoe and more zucchini (3) add 1/2 cup orzo last 10-15 min. This is a regular meal in our rotation. Yum!

First of all DON'T use chopped spinach, and second...if you do, DON'T use a second bag/box of frozen spinach.  I love vegetables so I used two boxes of frozen chopped spinach.....way too much!  My soup ended up tasting like spinach soup instead.  I had doubled the recipe anyway...and thought it would be fine.  I will try this again.  I really like soups w/out noodles..and with 1500 reviews, I  know it will be good...it I make a few adjustments.

A co worker recommended this recipe and I loved it.  I've made it twice now; the second time I added some diced potato and that worked well also.  Will definitely make this soup a regular in my house.

This was a big hit.  I used hot Italian sausage and added NO salt or pepper.  It already had plenty of both.  I will make this again soon.  I need to take some to my elderly parents.  They too would love it.

Good stuff.  Made as directed.  It was a little spicy, but not too bad.  Added some lemon juice to my bowl to cool the spice, but the rest of the family enjoyed the small kick.

This was sooo easy and great tasting.  Even my 16 year old daughter who dislikes most everything without sugar loved it!!  I had some leftover boiled potatoes from another meal that I added to the soup and I also added some orzo as another reviewer had suggested.  Both were great.  You don't need any onions or other chopped stuff as it is great as is.  Serve with a salad and some garlic bread and you have an awesome meal!

We read through the reivews and followed the advice of TrackMom on 02/06/04.  We have made it several times and it is THE best soup we've ever had.  So glad that we stumbled upon the recipe and tried it.  This soup rivals anything you'd eat at a nice Italian restaurant.

The only thing I did different was that I cooked the Italian sausage links in water on low till they were done. Let them cool, and sliced into pieces, and put into food processor, until the texture of ground beef. This way, you get sausage with each and every spoonful of soup. Other than that, this soup is every bit delicious.

What a nice soup to have a cold fall evening. I made this soup for the first time today, and it will definitely be a keeper in my home. First off, I don't fry foods, so I cooked the sausage in the microwave, adding the garlic to the beef broth and tomato mixture. We like green beans, so I added those instead of Northern beans. I also added the zucchini, and carrots, and spinach. In the end, I added 1/2 cup elbow macaroni. We had a salad and rolls to complete our meal. There is enough for leftovers. DELICIOUS!

I have not ate any soup make in a house kitchen that was this great in years.  I usually don't eat left over soup a day or two after made but, this I did and just as good or better. A must to make if you haven't had it. The right kind/quality of sausage makes the difference. agree on the spinach in at the end. Harv from Pa.

Both hubby and I loved it! I added a chopped onion and cooked it along with the sausage and garlic. Also substituted kale for the spinach, and added the kale in Step 1 along with the tomatoes and carrots. Also added a few cubed potatoes and 2 cups chicken broth.  Delicious!

This soup is EXCELLENT! I made it exactly the way the recipe was submitted, and I wouldn't change a thing. This soup was extremely easy to make plus it looked special. This recipe is definitely a keeper! (Note: I used sweet Italian sausage. You should use mild to hot sausage if you prefer a spicy taste.)

Amazing!  Authentic Italian taste!  Paired it with a Cabernet and a roasted garlic loaf.  It satisfied the tastes of three picky boys.  Next time I will hide the stewed tomatoes by purifying them first.

Absolutely delicious!  I added chopped leeks in place of the carrots and omitted the zuchini, but added 1 1/2 cups of tiny shells.  I think the pasta really added to this soup.  Is my new favorite soup and will be on my table often from now on.

Super good, you can use Swiss Chard in place of the Spinach, if you have a bunch of it in your garden. Kale works  very well too. Just be sure you simmer, in the last step, at least 5 min. as both Swiss Chard and Kale are stronger than Spinach.  Enjoy!

I make this all the time.  I love it.  Reheats well and I've even used frozen zucchini and spinach and it still comes out great.  I usually add an onion and use two cloves of garlic for personal preference.

Yummy! Satisfying! Will make this soup again for sure. I doubled it to give some to my sister. I used what I had on hand, such as, bean medely instead of Northern beans. I used no sodium broth and found I needed to add salt, omitted the spinach, didnt have any on hand, added onion to the meat while browning. I cooked one cup of very small star noodles, rinsed them and added them at the very end. I doubled up on the amount of broth. Served with a loaf of fresh Italian bread.

This is my favorite soup! It is healthy, delicious, pleasing to the eye and has great depth of flavor. I use turkey Italian sausage to cut down on the fat and have substituted chicken broth for beef in a pinch. It also freezes well. You will not be disapppointed.

This soup is so flavorful.  I substituted kale for the spinach and added more garlic.  Don't buy sausage links use the other kind.

I made this with a regular breakfast sausage with a bit of Italian seasoning added to it, b/c it was all I had on hand.  It was incredible!  The sausage was a bit spicy, and my family really liked it this way.

Made this last night, it was SO GOOD. I was surprised. I wasn't sure about the combination of ingredients, but it was one of the best soups I've ever made. Mine came out more stew-like, which is fine. All the flavor was there. I substituted the Stewed tomatoes for a can of Diced Tomatoes and Jalapenos and 2 8oz cans of Tomato Sauce. I omitted the salt and used less than a pound of sausage (about 4), and frozen-thawed spinach. I will DEFINITELY be making this one again and again.

Made this with only two alterations.  I used a box of Emeril's 32 ounce beef stock in place of the 2 cans.  Then, when I served it, I added fresh parmesan on top.  Excellent!  The spiciness of the soup depends on how spicy your sausage is.

LOVE IT! I've made this 4 times in the past 3 months, each time making so much that it lasts a week. One of the best all-time meals I've ever eaten. Ever. And the best part is it's so simple to make and quick. The ingredients blend together so well - it's amazing. Everyone has to try it!

Very tasty, easy to make. It doesn't produce alot of broth and I even added an extra can. I did add orzo pasta so that could account for less broth. I didn't have carrots on hand and I used a package of frozen spinach at the end. Overall the flavors are nice. Will make with turkey italian sausage next time.Delicioso!

I thought this soup was good but not outstanding.  I added an extra can of beef broth as others suggested, but I think I would have liked it a little better as written.  The soup is colorful and gorgeous, but I probably won't make it again.

This is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing. I do add about a 1/2 cup onion and one med. yellow squash but other than that, make this as directed. This is great served with hot water bread.

Skipped the spinach (kale just seems to fit this better, but I didn't have any of that), threw in about a cup of shell pasta.  Also used 2 cans instead of 1 of the tomatoes.  The only thing I would do differently next time is possibly a dash of red pepper flakes and more broth.  This has been added to our number 1 meals, everyone LOVED it!

I just wanted to add that it's been a while since I first tried this recipe and I've made it literally more than a dozen times, we love it so much.  Everytime italian sausage goes on sale I make it!  Thanks again for this recipe.

I make this dish pretty much according to the recipe and it is my son's favorite! The only thing that I add is some medium-small cooked pasta of some sort. I just boil it separately, drain and add in at the end of cooking. It makes the soup more of a meal.  My son will actually eat all of the veggies (he'd usually balk at the tomatoes) and asks for this soup specifically. Filling and great for a cold day.

AWESOME!!  I made a few changes/additions... added a red and green pepper, in lieu of the zucchini, for a bit more punch, 2 large onions, a can of kidney beans, a can of (reduced sodium) chicken broth, and finally at the end, vermicelli rice...YUM!!! I doubled the recipe and it was so great, 2 of us nearly finished it in one sitting!!!  Excellent autumn or winter dish..trust me, you won't be disappointed!

This is a great platform for any italian-style soup. I used this recipe last night as a base for my own hodgepodge. Even before I began adding extra ingredients I found that it is necessary to have a minimum of 1 more can (about 1.5 cups) of broth. To boot, I read all the suggestions from other cooks and incorporated most of them, so I ended up needing much more liquid than the original recipe calls for (I lost track of the measurements after a while... part of what makes this a fun soup). Mine had a little of everything: mushrooms, rice, potatoes, pasta, red onion, LOTS of extra garlic, plus everything in the original recipe. It really does turn out more like a stew- an incredibly delicious italian-style stew! Definitely worth keeping around, especially for the fall/winter seasons.

Excellent and tasty! I used Italian sweet turkey sausage and added chopped onion to the initial garlic and tukey browning. I also added about three cloves of garlic, 2 Tbsp. of oregano, and a pinch of red pepper. Will definitely make again.

We don't traditionally like soup but this is great, I can't seem to make it wrong. We've used ditalini, potatoes, rice and the beans it calls for. I always used diced tomatoes instead of stewed because I like them better. It's a winner, company worthy and really good. My husband, who travels during the day, says it's good cold. We always use fresh spinach.

This soup is wonderful and easy. I had some Italian Sausage so I went browsing for a new recipe. I am a obsessive soup fan so I thought this would be the perfect recipe for an October night. I didn't have any of the other ingredients but after a fast stop at the market I had everything for under 10. We read over the other reviews and agreed that it could be changed for your own personal preference, but we thought for the 1st time making it we would just follow the recipe as is.It was so good,full of fresh vegetables. I wish I was still eating it. The flavor is perfect and I did add some red pepper flakes because I like a spicy soup but Hot Italian Sausage doesn't sit well in my stomach. I don't think I will change anything next time except maybe use turkey Italian Sausage to cut down on the fat. This soup is so yummy with fresh extra sourdough and a good red Italian wine. We had Chianti. I think I will be adding it to my list of favorites and many of them are soups! Thank you.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was so good and easy.  Just like any soup should be.  The marriage of tastes between the spinach, hot italian sausage and the Great Northern Beans is what makes this soup so different and one that will be on my monthly cook list.

I made a few alterations based on my family's tastes and the limitations of my pantry. I needed some extra liquid because I live at a high altitude, so I chose chicken broth. I also added chopped celery, and I didn't have beans on hand so I used diced potatoes instead. Unfortunately, I had to use frozen zucchini and spinach because I didn't have access to any fresh stuff that was in nice condition. Overall, the soup turned out a bit bland, but that might have just been the fault of the added liquid, so I added some dried basil and oregano to perk it up a bit. It turned out pretty good. A nice basic soup, easy to make and easy to modify.

Excellent soup as is, although my family did not care for it as much as I did. I will add barley to it next time to make it even heartier.

This was an excellent Soup! Especially on those cold, dreary winter nights. As per others recommendations I added tortellini, extra garlic & oregano, ++ extra broth and hot italian sausage. I will definately make this one again!

A really good soup for a wet rainy day, it tasted just as good the next day. The only thing i did differently was use turkey sausage

This soup is the best! I have made it so many times and everyone raves about it. I usually add some orzo pasta as it makes it a little heartier for my husband but it certainly doesn't need a thing. So good and easy!

So great -but I used suggestions from others. First I used turkey italian sausage to reduce fat, used 2 cloves of garlic and added a small chopped onion, used cannellini beans instead of great northern,  and used potato cut into small chunks instead of the zucchini, used Ox's no-sodium beef broth packets & omitted the salt and it was still salty enough.  Last time I made it I threw in a handful of tiny pasta but it really doesn't need it -this is a filling soup full of vitamins.  The fresh spinach added at the end really makes it!

I didn't have zucchini, but I'm sure this would have been even better without it.  I used frozen spinach (thawed) and canned sliced carrots instead of fresh.  It was still delicious!  I'll definitely make it again with zucchini!

Excellent!! Robust & hearty.  I used hot sausage, not sweet, and omitted the salt.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is and will make it this way next time.  This soup would definately impress dinner guests.  I made this three days ago and my husband is still commenting on how good it was.

What a great (and easy) recipe.   I added a chopped onion and some Acini de Pepe pasta and I think they enhanced the recipe.   I also substituted kale for the spinach.    I do that in any soup recipe that calls for spinach.   Kale has a nice flavor and does not get all soft and mushy like spinach does.

This soup is really easy to make, I think I already memorized the recipe! I thought it was going to need some herbs or spice, but I thought it was delicious as is. I used mild Italian sausage and low sodium beef broth. The sausage really gives the soup a great flavor.

Wonderful!  I have never had much success making soup, but this one turned out great.  I added red bell pepper and ditalini and about 1.5 teaspoons of Ms Dash Italian Seasoning.  Yummy!  Family loved it... hardley any leftovers! Next time I will add more onion and more garlic, as I love those flavors.

Incredible!  I used Jimmy Dean's sage sausage.  Added and onion and italian seasoning.  To add extra beans I used a can of red kidney beans when I added the northern beans.  I also subsituted frozen spinach at the end.  Loved this soup.  Can't wait to make again!

Excellent Soup.  We used hot italian sausage, probably would have been better to use either the sweet italian sausage, or half of each. Maybe add more beans next time.   Still, it was very good.

I changed this up a bit due to not having some ingredients.  I cut up leftover pork roast and substituted it instead of sausage, I also didn't have tomatoes.  It turned out really good.  I liked using the spinich in it for extra fiber and it made it look bright and colorful.

I loved this soup!  All of the fresh vegetables were a perfect pair with the sausage.  Great as leftovers too.  Can't wait to make it again.

I skipped the beans and spinach and added tortelini- Pretty much I combined this recipe with Tortelini Sausage SoupI from this website and it was excellent.  We ate it all week and loved it.  This is great for a cold New England night...

I made this dish tonight exactly as the recipe specified and it was so wonderful.  My husband loved it and my kids (ages 4 and 6) were actually making "mmmm" sounds as they ate!  I will absolutely add this to our family recipe book to be made again and again.

This is one of the absolute best new additions to my cooking repertoir in a long time!!! It is easy, quick, inexpensive and DELICIOUS!!! I pretty much followed the original recipe, but there are so many ways yiou can change it if you need variation... Add mushrooms for mushroom lovers; corn; all kinds of veggies... You name it, it can all go in the soup and it would still be as delicious as the original! I have made it several times with slight variations and always with the same result: family and friends finish every bite and more often than not ask for the recipe! THANK YOU!!!

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!  The only thing I did differently was to add an extra can of beef broth. I had never used those beans before but they were good.  I did freeze half of it and the beans got a little mushy on the reheat. Next time, I will remove the beans from the portion I freeze. Definately make this recipe - you'll love it!

Very good soup and a great opportunity to eat lots of vegetables!  I added an onion, extra broth and about a cup of rice to the soup.  I also sprinkled some Italian seasoning into the soup and used frozed chopped spinach instead of fresh.  I put the stewed tomatoes in the food processor to chop them up before adding them to the soup.  It was good stuff!

This soup is excellent!  Everybody I've made it for loves it.  Especially me!  My parents, who have become food connoisseurs in their golden years,  have made it one of their favorites.  The only change I've made to the recipe was to add and extra can of beans and more garlic.  Thanks for a great soup!

This soup was excellent!! I used hot, spicy sausage and added minced onion when browning.  The last 10 minutes of cooking, I threw in mushroom tortellini. This will definately be a staple in my home.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!  Thank you, thank you for a delicious easy recipe.

i didn't love it, but everyone that i made this for rated it a 5. I think fresh spinach would taste better (if you add spinach at all!!) I would also add that noodles at the very end so that they don't soak up all the broth and turn into a stew.

Wow! This soup is super easy and super good. Like other reviews I added onion to the mix. I substituted sweet turkey Italian sausage (minus the casings), and then added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes to add a little heat. I also added 1/4 cup dried orzo pasta with the zucchini. It turned out great and I will absolutely be making it again!!

Yummy...I doubled the broth and used veggie stock.  I added a can of corn (drained)and some onions.  It was very good.  It makes a good amount so be ready for left overs.  This will go into my recipe rotation!

With this soup it was the first time I've ever been able to get my children to eat zucchini and ask for seconds.  However not everyone loved the soup. My husband thought the sausage ruined the flavor.  May try to use a different meat next time.

I just made this last night and really loved it.  Wait till the end to add salt as the broth and sausage can make it a touch salty.  But D-eliscious!

This is a great soup and loved by everyone in my family.  The hot sausage adds just the right amount of spice and flavour to the soup.  I will definitely make it again.

I used garlic powder instead of cloves, diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and added diced onions.  Other than that, followed everything else.  I also used all hot italian sausage.  This is a keeper!  Next time I'll try turkey sausage and low sodium broth to reduce fat/salt content.

This soup is absolutely delicious.  The only changes I made were to use half sweet/half hot sausage and I added diced onion.  My husband couldn't quit raving about it.  In fact he said he was looking forward to his second bowl before he finished his first.  I served it with some rustic toasted bread and topped the soup with asiago cheese.

This took me a little more time to prepare than suggested, but it was fantastic.  I did almost everything right by the recipe except I used kale instead of spinach and I thickened it into a stew with 4 ounces less broth and the addition of a little corn starch.  SO GOOD!  I served it in sourdough bread bowls and the dish received great compliments.  Simple ingredients, awesome flavor!

Excellent-did a few substitutions like added 1/4 head of cabbage,used 3 cups of Carlos Rossi Paisano wine. turned out great and even better the next day, it thickens almost like a stew. I did reduce the amount of sausage by half. Great cold evening food.

I sauted all of the veggies and half a finely copped onion (with the exceptionof the spinach saved for last) in with the sausage after I drained off the fat.  I also used a 4 cup box of sodium reduced beef stock instead of the 2 cups listed in the recipe and added a 19 oz. can of Unico mixed bean medley (kidney beans, chick peas, black beans, etc) and 1/4 c. barley.  AWESOME.
Update 9/23/2011:  I have made it again with reconstituted mixed dry beans instead of the canned [less sodium] and kale instead of spinach [keeps its shape & texture much better] which gets slimey.  Much better with these modifications.

I made this soup as lunch for me and my boyfriend today, so I halved the recipe. I ditched the spinach and added a ricotta and spinach tortellini instead, to make it more filling. Used canned carrots and added those in with the beans and zucchini instead of the tomatoes (didn't want them to cook too long). Used low-sodium beef broth, and both hot and sweet sausages (would maybe just use hot next time). We both loved it and did not need to add any more spices - the beef broth (even low-sodium) and the stewed tomatoes provided plenty of salt and seasoning! I should have followed reviewer advice and added more broth, as I don't have much left for tomorrow's leftovers. With the tortellini added, and a small bit of bread on the side, this one dish kept us full until dinner. Will definitely be making again.

Super easy, really delicious. I left out the spinach(hubby can't eat it)& added cheese tortellini, sprinkled with reduced fat parm cheese, it was a perfect healthy winter meal. Italian stewed tomatoes are a MUST for this recipe-it adds so much flavor. Thanks so much!

We love this soup!  Even my 2 1/2 year old daughter (who is not a veggie lover at all) will ask for this at lunch over and over again.  I cut the sausage in half and add lots more zucchini to make it healthier!  Yummy!

Really, really yummy!! As usual, I tweaked a bit. Used hot italian turkey sausage, extra cloves of garlic, a small leek that I had on hand as well as some fresh basil and rosemary. Lastly, I used chicken stock (forgot to buy beef) and omitted the salt. Will be making this again and again!!

This is a great recipe! I made it just after Christmas for the first time.  My husband has requested it several time since.  I left out the zucchini (because the pot was full)  I placed some raw spinach in a bowl and put the hot soup on top of it to "cook" the spinach.....delicious!

This was wonderful!  I used turkey sausage, and added some diced onion and potato.  Very flavorful.  I would definitely make this again.

WOW! I can't get my family to eat homemade soup, but am sick of conforming to their tastes and never trying anything new. Made this and my super picky husband ate 2 helpings (with cooked carrots, zucchini, beans and all). Even my picky kids ate it. (I had to fudge a little on what was really in it though.) Just added a small can of tomato sauce and added some leftover noodles to our bowls.

Hands down my family voted this soup recipe their absolute favorite!  I made this on a Saturday night and served it with Italian bread, and by Sunday afternoon for lunch the whole pot was gone!  This will definitely be a keeper this winter!  Forgot to add... about a 1/2 hour before soup was done I added 2 cups of zucchini (cut Julienne style.

This really has a great flavor, I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a huge sausage fan so that is the only thing that I would cut back on.  I did like some others and added another can of stewed tomatoes and beans.  I didn't add more broth, I felt it had plenty liquid. I had a rotisserie chicken in the fridge that I just cut some chunks off and added at the last, also a potatoe, and some mushrooms when I was browning the sausage. I really liked the chicken in there.  Lots of things you could add to this soup, fun to tweak to your liking.

It had good flavor, and I was worried about it not being good up until I served it in the bowls. This was partly my fault though. I used sausages that I had on hand, which are much healthier b/c they are chicken sausages with red pepper (but they have no skin from which to crumble the meat, and they are fully cooked; just need warming). But it still turned out good. I too added an onion and an xtra clove of garlic. I am cautious of the sodium content though (even though I used low sodium organic broth), I feel there was much salt in the bean liquid and stewed toms. liquid. We did enjoy it though.

This soup is a huge hit.  I was concerned about how it would taste, but it is delicious.  I now make it in bulk and freeze it for those cold winter days.

This may be the best soup I have ever made. I added a chopped onion and two cloves of garlic to sausage as it browned. I also added 1/2 cup Orzo about 7 minutes after the zucchini started to simmer.

I was kinda disappointed with this recipe. It had a good flavor but nothing that really made it "stand out". I think I might be a bit biased though because it's the first recipe that I've gotten off this sight that received only mediocre reviews. Definatly play with it and tweak to suit your tastes.

This was excellent!  I doubled the recipe and used half reg italian sausage and half hot and would probably stick to the regular next time.   My family loved it though.   Had a wonderful flavor.

I'm just starting to cook and this is one of the best meals I've ever made.  It was easy, did't require a lot of ingredients and tasted really good.  I added two sprigs of fresh rosemary, one onion and a little Tabasco sauce. Parmesean cheese, also made it even more special.

Absolutely delicious, hearty and easy!
I made minute rice on the side, and added it to our bowls, as I don't want to freeze the rice.  You could use a small pasta too.  I sprinkled on parmesan cheese at the last minute to our bowls.  Definitely worthwhile making and have sent it on to numerous friends and family.

Wonderful! :) 

I added an additional garlic clove and 1/2 c. of orzo as others suggested.  

It was yummy! :)  I'll definitely be making this again and again.

Great healthy and hearty soup.  I used low sodium vegetable broth and Tofurky Italian sausage to make the soup vegetarian.  I also used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes since it was what I had on hand.  It gave the soup a nice smoky flavor, so I think I'll keep that change in the future.

I tend to choose my recipes based on ratings...more than anything else. I found this one and it got glowing reviews...but it really sounded too simple to be true. I gave it a shot anyhow, using my in-laws as guinea pigs, and everyone just went wild...we ate and ate and ate the stuff. I will definitely make this one again...over and over again :) A keeper!

This soup was delicious- and even better the next day.  My husband suggested adding the pasta next time and a bit more tomato- it reminded him of the pasta fajoili at Olive Garden. This is a definite keeper.

I couldn't believe this recipe was given a 5 star rating until I tasted it. It lives up to it's rating. I used hot and sweet italian turkey sausage.I took advice from others and added onion, orzo, potato and more beef broth. My husband and I both loved it. This recipe is both delicious and nutritious! Perfect for fall!

This soup was fabulous!  I made only a couple of small changes.  I doubled up on the garlic, used low-sodium broth and, since I didn't want to waste it, a whole bag of spinach.  I also omitted the salt and pepper as we thought it was plenty tasty without it.  What a wonderful, easy recipe!  Thank you, Karen!

This was a really great soup.  This will definitely will be on my list to make again.I added an extra 14 oz of broth.  Normally when I make soup the broth is absorbed by the ingredients in the soup.

This soup is really good.  I made a couple of changes to mine though.  I use hot Italian sausage in mine and I also added 1/2 a chopped onion and 1 cup of macaroni to mine to make it more hearty.

This was pretty good, but I didn't love it.   Something about the fatty sausage in a non-cream-based liquid didn't work for me.  It did have a good flavor, so I'd recommend it for others who don't mind the sausage/broth pairing.  If I make it again, I'll add another can of beans and try using frozen spinach.

This soup is quick, easy and full of flavor.  I love the zucchini and the tortellini with the savory broth.  I used Italian Chicken Sausage in mine and it was amazing.  This meal goes great with crusty break for sopping of the broth.

Excellent soup. Works great with chicken broth and fresh tomatoes instead of beef broth and canned tomatoes. For veggies I only used zuchini, squash and carrots as well. Also added a few strands of angel hair pasta.

We made this on a snowy winter day and it was great!  I did add a large onion and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  Other than those two changes followed the recipe exactly. Very Good!

I have been using All recipes for a year now and this is by far the best recipe I have found. Everyone suggestions and variations are GREAT. I have found myself stuck and have substituted bullion, black beans, peas, and other vegies and it is always good and my family always loves it. Thank you for a great recipe.

This soup was not only delicious but it was easy and fit well into my nutrition plan.  The kids were a little hesitant about all of the veggies but they loved the sausage and the broth. I added some crushed red pepper flakes during the process and it added just the kick we needed. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for a birthday party this last Friday.  Everyone at the party wanted the recipe.  I did make some changes.  I tripled the amount of garlic and because I used mild Italian Sausage, I added some red pepper flakes.  It was awesome and also the easiest soup that I made for the event.

Oh, so satisfying. I substituted spinach instead of zucchini (they serve it that way at Macaroni Grill.) Also added fresh tortellini and extra Italian herbs. My entire family says it's a new favorite!

This is really a superb soup, although I did make some changes to suit my own taste.

Instead of Italian Sausage, I used Farmer John "Firehouse Hot" Pork Sausage. It's a 12 ounce sausage that imparts a great deal of flavor and spice. (It's also a way to lower the fat content of the soup for those, like me, who are watching their weight.) I added an additional clove of garlic because I like more garlic. 

Also, I replaced the zuchini and spinach with cabbage. I tore the cabbage up into large bit size pieces. The mild, sweet flavor of the cabbage presented a perfect counterbalance to the zesty heat of the sausage.

I couldn't recommend this soup more strongly!!! I will be making it again very soon and anticipate that it will become part of the regular rotation of soups in our home.

So, go ahead and make this excellent soup. You won't be disappointed.

I also added some small, pre-cooked pasta at the end.  Our tastes run to "SPICY" so I used extra-hot sausage from the local Italian market.  Husband, son and daughter all loved it!  Very flavorful and guaranteed to warm you up on a cold day.

I gave this dish a rating of 10 stars.  First time I made it, and it was awsome.  I doubled the receipt, but added only 1/2 the spinach.  Neighbors loved it as well.

Wonderful flavor blend.  I am not a fan of spinach so I substitute yellow squash and the flavor is still excellent.  Serve with a salad and foccaccia bread and your meal is complete.

My 12 year old son loves this soup!  He begs for me to make this soup in the middle of the summer!  The first time I made the soup, by brother and his family was over.  After dinner, my sister-in-law insisted on having the recipe to make at home.  This soup is really delicious!

Excellent!!  I made this tonight for my mother in law and husband and they both loved it (me too).  The only thing I did different was I added 1 can of stewed tomatoes and I diced up a fresh tomato, I to added more garlic and a little water, about 2 cups.  I will defintely make this again.

I made this as spicy as I could stand it using red pepper flakes and cayun pepper.  I left out the spinach and carrots because I didn't have any, but added mushrooms instead.  It turned out great and got better and better as leftovers!

This was a nice quick and easy meal that my whole family liked.  I added about 1/4 cup of orzo and left out the spinach because my little boy won't eat it.  I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on each serving and it was great!

This soup needs a sprinkling of freshly grated parmesan cheese to make it shine. Hubby and I really liked it, but for some reason teenage daughter did not. This is healthy and easy- I'd make again.

I increased this recipe for 20 servings and just had rave reviews.  Thankfully had left overs which I froze - it was delicious warmed over!  I'm making it again and again!
