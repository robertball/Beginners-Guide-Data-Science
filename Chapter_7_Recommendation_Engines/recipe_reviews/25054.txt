I love this recipe!  I like to make big batches of cookies at a time and freeze them, and these freeze really well.  I doubled the recipe and used an 11 x 17 jelly roll pan.  I also have used different fillings instead of the jam, like apple pie filling, pineapple filling, and I've even used a chocolate hazelnut spread and almond paste in the middle.  This recipe is very versatile, be creative and try different jams, preserves and fillings.  The dough is stiff enough, it works with just about anything you put in the middle.  Also, for the top layer, I just crumbled some of the remaining dough on top instead of trying to flatten it.  It saved time and worked just as good.  The rest of the dough that I didn't use, I formed it into a ball, rolled it out, and made cut out sugar cookies out of it.  The dough also worked great as a sugar cookie dough!  Thanks for the recipe!

Cut this recipe in half and use an 8 x 8 pan.  I made a batch and took them to work.  Two co-workers asked for the recipe.  You can use seedless jam, or preserves, and still have a good result.  This is almost identical to a recipe I cut out of the newspaper 25+ years ago, but then lost.  In the first recipe I had, you could add some chopped nuts to the batter.

I love recipes that are simple, quick and delicious.  These bars are perfect when you want an extra special bar cookie.  When I made these I actually added an extra cup of butter for more richness, used seedless raspberry jam and baked them in a 12Â½ x 17-inch baking pan for about 40-45 minutes.  I made them for our family Christmas party.  They were a big hit as everyone loved them.  My sister-in-law loved them so much she asked for the recipe.  (She calls them 'The Big Booty Butter Bars'!)  She made them for her family and to give away as treats to the neighbors.  I will definitely make them again and I will use other fillings as suggested by another reviewer (although the raspberry jam is delightful!).  Thanks for a great recipe!

I took this to a pot-luck last night, and it was well recieved.  The dough is quite rich, and the jam inside is a nice surprise.  It was far from completely baked at 30 minutes.  We left it in the oven another 20 and it was nicely done.

These bars came out inedibly greasy. They also required more than twice the baking time stated in the recipe. Sorry.

I can always count on Allrecipes.com!!  I went to a party and the baker of these bar cookies would not give up the recipe....I have given several of mine & I thought there would be a trade.  How rude.  Allrecipes and Debbie came to my rescue...after only 10 mins of ingredient searching, I found it!! Now I can make this "secret recipe" any time I want.  I WILL share this recipe to anyone who asks and show some recipe etiquette!  I can giggle to myself that her "secret Recipe" is no longer a secret!! :)

I had a little trouble putting the extra batter on top of the jam, but overall these were delicious!  Handy recipe too, with very few ingredients.

I followed the recipe to a t and I did not care for it.  Was a batter not a dough and would not get done even after an hour.

Pretty simple to make. Used my hands to mix in the flour, it was easier that way. Very buttery.  I had leftover whole wheat flour that I used 2 cups WW and 2 cups AP flour and you can't tell the difference. Make sure to use jam and preserves; a chunky all fruit kind of spread. Would make again and maybe add some real fruit like sliced strawberries or frozen blueberries.

I made this for my husband for father's day (he loves raspberries). It was easy to make, was o.k not the best I've had. They were very rich. I used non seeded raspberry jam (I hate the seeds).Don't know if I will make again.

I've made this a handful of times, and it's really good.  We found the shortbread a little heavy/rich/thick the first time so I cut the amount of the dough to 3/4 and it was perfect.

So easy, super tasty.

I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan. I also put half raspberry jam on one side and half apricot preserves on the other side. It was very delicious!! I will definitely be making this again! Now I just need some vanilla ice cream to go with it :)

This recipe is awesome. I did how ever bake for 50 minutes at 350 degrees. The cookie part is melt in your mouth. I did not use all of the remaining dough for the top. The dough would also make a excellent sugar cookie. I will make again.  Thank You! Diane
