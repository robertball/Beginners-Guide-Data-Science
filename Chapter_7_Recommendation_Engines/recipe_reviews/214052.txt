This tasted like a weird egg/potato salad mixture to me.  Sorry, I didn't care for it.  Follow up:  I added some potatoes to it and it made a decent potato salad :)

This is an odd egg salad.  A Tablespoon and a half of sugar made this WAY too sweet for us.  I also don't understand "light"  mayonnaise and then adding bacon, mozzarella and sugar.

Made this for Easter a year ago. Have made it for every holiday/family gathering since. It always goes quickly. No leftovers - and I double the recipe (although not the vinegar because that seems to make it a little too runny).

I prepared this recipe as stated in the directions. (I am not yet a "freelancer" in the kitchen.) My family enjoyed it as a part of our gameday festivities. It was yummy! Easy to prepare - Gives you the best part of the deviled egg without actually deviled eggs. :)

Prepared per recipe. Didn't like. Sounded good. Was making to take to Super Bowl tomorrow. Now I have to run to town so I can make something else. Adding the paprika to the mixture gave it an off color. Way to much vinegar. Strong tasting & made it runny. I'm wondering if it was suppose to be 1 tablespoon & 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1-1/2 tablespoons. My opinion would be to use cheddar cheese to add more color & taste. Maybe salad dressing would have been better than using mayo & vinegar. I won't ever know. From now on I'll just stick to making regular deviled eggs.  
Update:  After being refrigerated it isn't so juicy. The vinegar taste has mellowed somewhat. It's edible but not something that says "Wow". Maybe my problem. When I take something somewhere I want it to be "Wow".

This sounded odd, but I made it to try it out as one of several Game Day dips with crackers. None of the other dips got touched - the guys scarfed this down & literally begged for more!  It was the hit of the night - will be using this often!

When I tried this recipe for the first time, I only had grated cheddar on hand, but it's very good that way, too!
