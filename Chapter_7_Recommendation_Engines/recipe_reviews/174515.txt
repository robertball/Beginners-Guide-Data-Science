Delicious! The saffron, wine & clam juices were a heady addition to a homemade Alfredo sauce. I used penne instead of linguine ~ I wanted a pasta shape which would grab the wonderful sauce.

There were no fresh clams at the store so I used the canned ones; I will have to try to get fresh clams next time.  As I made it, it was a little bland.  It was okay though.
