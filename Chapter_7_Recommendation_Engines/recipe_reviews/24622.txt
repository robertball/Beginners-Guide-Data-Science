SOOOOOOO good. Be careful not to let the kiddie's get into this one, I have a three-year-old who tried his darndest! I made this the second time as a nightime snack for myself and hubby...much better when you don't have to swat a toddler's hands out of the mix! Mmmmmmmm. By the way, we dipped fresh pineapple rings, fresh strawberries, bananas, and orange slices in this.

This was awesome and easy.  I used Captain Morgan's spiced rum and the flavor was superb.  I will make this one again and again.

I used this for coconut shrimp, but it would go nicely with veggies or fruit as well!

Fine, but not fabulous. Don't know what is wrong exactly, just not as much flavor as we had hoped.

I loooove this stuff.  I serve it at all my parties and catering gigs now.  I leave out the sugar - doesn't need it at all.  I have substituted the rum with Passion Fruit Rum - OMG!!!!  I have left the rum out all together when children are present and it's still fantastic.

This is a tasty dip! I made it according to the recipe. Next time I would leave out the strawberry daiquiri and add some coconut extract perhaps. The strawberry daiquiri mix is overpowering and causes the dip to lose it's coconut flavor.
