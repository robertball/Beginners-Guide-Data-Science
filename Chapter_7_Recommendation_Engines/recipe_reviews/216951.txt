perhaps to those that didn't like this recipe, may i suggest reducing the Water from 5 cups to 1 or even just using all Apple juise, just to barely cover the Ribs and use a tight lid. Cheers All :)

I got a little scared when I saw the reviews saying that it was flavorless, but still wanted to give it a shot. I used2qts apple juice, 2 cups water. I seasoned my ribs with season salt, montreal steak rub, and 5 spice powder. I also added 1\2 cup of hot sauce and 2 cups of brown sugar to the juice/ water. And since I have a large family, during the last 30 minutes, I tossed in 4 medium sliced potatoes, and served the "mix" over white rice.

I used boneless pork ribs covered in apple juice, with a chopped sweet onion and a little brown sugar, in the crock pot. After they slow cooked, I removed and put on the grill with BBQ sauce. Outstanding!

I agree with the other folks this recipe is very bland. Sorry. Unfortunately I can't taste the apple at all. Needs a sauce or something.

As written, this had no flavor, and created a watery apple onion mush, with very little meat. I really wish the poster had included a photo, and serving suggestions. It was bland at the one hour point, so we added a shot of whiskey, 2 tbsp molasses, 1tbsp Worcestershire, 2 tbsp Dijon mustard. We were short on apple cider, so we used 1.5 c apple cider, .25 c applejack, and .25 c orange juice. At 3.5 hours, it was mush floating in oily water, texture-wise. With what we added, it tasted great, so I might try it again with 2c water, an extra lb of ribs, our additions, and 3 hours cook time. Iâ€™d also wait to put the apples in until the halfway point.
