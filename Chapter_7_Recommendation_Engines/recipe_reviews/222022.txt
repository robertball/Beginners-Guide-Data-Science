Very good, however we did not enjoy the rosemary on it. I think if we left that out, and added a little bit more parm, it would be almost perfect!

Like the technique.  Corn cooked good.  Flavor, needs to maybe be more concentrated into the butter mix.

This is a great way to cook your corn.  Delicious flavor and the corn cooked up to perfection.  So much better than the boiling method.

Made this exactly like the recipe, except I did not have any rosemary leaves.  Very good!  My problem is:  Is it worth the trouble VS regular corn on the cob?  Heating up the grill, etc.  I had mine with pork chops that I cooked in the oven.  The taste was very good.  If I were to make it again, I would add more butter, parm cheese, salt & pepper.  I was afraid I put too much of the seasonings on, but by the time they cook, the ice melts, the majority of the seasonings are gone.
