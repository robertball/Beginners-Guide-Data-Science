This was wonderful.. and easy. The  saltiness of the bacon, the creaminess of the dip and the sweetness of the apple and the syrup... I'm a fan

Made it and served with mini waffles for a ladies book club meeting.  Everyone liked it - no raving or asking for recipe, but it was good.

I really wanted to love this dip because it was so different.   Sharp cheddar, apples, bacon, maple syrup:  I mean really what's not to love:  it's like a mouthful of fall.  I served this at a work potluck with french toast bagel pieces and it was good, but the more I ate the less I liked it.  Perhaps something about the gravy mix produced an odd flavor for me.
