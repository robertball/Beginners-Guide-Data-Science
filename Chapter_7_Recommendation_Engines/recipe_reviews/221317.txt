All I had was Jasmine rice, which is a long grain.

1. Did a quick rinse of the rice, because I've read its best to rinse your imported rice due to the difference in handling procedures (i.e. use of talc to give rice a whiter look) at the foreign company vs US companies
2. Blended on High (my blender says Liquefy) for 1 minute
3. Used full coconut milk vs light, which some say light is just full diluted with water
4. I wasn't around to whisk occasionally, but let it sit unattended for the full 3hrs
5. Used coconut sugar, which is just as sweet but much lower glycemic index.
6. I didn't bother transferring rice from blender to a bowl, but later blender clean up would have been easier vs. dealing with the settled rice in the bottom of the blender

My wife normally can't stand horchata, but she wanted seconds of this one! Great recipe. Thanks!

Good! The coconut flavor was very subtle, coconut lovers might prefer more! I used Silk original coconut milk. Maybe canned variety would provide a bit more. Blending the cinnamon with the rice in the beginning was great, as dissolving larger amounts of cinnamon is difficult at the end ( if you've done this before with cinnamon at the end you know what I'm talking about!). The fam loves horchata, age 2-7 for the kids and my husband and I too!! The last time we were in mexico we stumbled upon horchata with coconut milk and it was great! We had to try this. Definitely worth it to try this variety!
