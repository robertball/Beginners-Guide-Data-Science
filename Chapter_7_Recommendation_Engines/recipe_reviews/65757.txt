As bland as the day is long, unless you can get fresh morels and fresh olives.  Don't bother otherwise- if you can only get dehydrated morels and canned olives, pass on this recipe.

This was amazingly good and pretty simple. I reduced the liquid in the polenta to 1 cup milk and 2 cups stock and cooked the polenta for about 20 minutes. By making the polenta the night before, the final cooking time isn't a burden after work. You can get morels in a lot of farmer's markets in the spring or in nice groceries with big produce sections. Of course, the best alternative is to have a coworker who brings you them from his home in the mountains! It's important to "cultivate" friends like these!
