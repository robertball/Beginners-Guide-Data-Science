These cookies are what my husbands grandmother used to make.  One thing I did different is refrigerate the dough overnight (like grandma used to).  I used graduated round cookie cutters for the middle hole and outer circle.  Also, we like to eat this cookie soft so after frosting them I put them in a cookie tin overnight with a piece of bread.  Then, the next day the cookies are soft and chewy.  Thanks for the recipe, my husband, kids and I love it!

I thought that these were pretty good.  I made them for a bake sale.  They were bought, but nobody commented on if they were good, also there were no repeat customers.  The cookies were firm and thin.  They didn't spread much at all when baking.  The filling reminded me of the filling in an Oreo, but gingery.

Too much flour makes these crumbly. Addictive if you can get them made.

These are really nice cookies for the fall. The dough is quite soft and is easier to work with if chilled for a while. I use graduated flower shaped cutters, it adds an extra touch.

I used only the icing part of this for another cookie and it's very good.

A lot of work.  They were good, but I probably wouldn't make again.

I made some changes-- I use butter instead of margarine, and half brown sugar/half white sugar.  I only needed to bake them for 6 1/2 minutes which browned the bottom but kept them soft.  I added spices (ginger & cinnamon) to the dough with the flour and used a different filling the 2nd time, as the filling (without ginger) was okay but nothing special the first time.  Very fun as squirrel sandwich cookies.

I mixed it in the stand mixer and refrigerated over night. Easy to roll with a little flour. I always roll my cookies on parchment paper with a sheet of plastic wrap over it (so the dough doesn't stick to my rolling pin). The cookies are soft and delicious. I made gingerbread men and reindeer. A huge hit!
