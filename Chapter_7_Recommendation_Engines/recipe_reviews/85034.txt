Although I made some changes due to either what I had on hand or personal taste, I'm still rating it a four because the basic idea was great and it gave me a good start. I just happened to have king crab legs in the freezer which I thawed, removed the meat and saved the shells to cook in the sauce. (which, by the way, gave the sauce an amazing flavor) Definitely did not see the need to even use butter, let alone that much of it. I simply sauteed onion, fresh garlic (no salt) paprika and red bell pepper in a bit of olive oil, added two cans of diced tomatoes along with the legs and let it simmer. Once done, I added in the crab meat just long enough to heat thru. I decreased the amount of red pepper flakes, but they really added just the right amount of spice to the dish. Thanks so much!

This will be on the menu a lot, a great light dinner.  I did make a few changes; I used half the pasta (just 2 for dinner), fresh garlic (3 cloves), and only 2 TBSP of butter (and the red pepper flakes to taste - ie. definitely less then 1 1/2 TBSP!).  We loved it made like this, but the sauce wasn't necessarily saucy, I don't know what it would have been like if I had used the recipes pasta amount.  I did add about 1/4 cup of reserved pasta water when adding the crab tomato mixture to the pasta.  Sprinkled a bit of parm cheese over the top.  Delicious.

This is an easy and versatile meal that tastes great!! You can substitute the garlic powder for fresh garlic and add onions too. I also added extra tomatoes and a drop of olive oil.

I started off rating this a 4 and moved way up the scale to a 5!  Use fresh garlic, tomatoe paste, extra tomatoes.  Fresh basil and crab are nearly a must!  I would recommend added the fresh crab towards the end of the cooking process.  Let all of the flavors meld prior.  This is sooooo yummy!

All I had in the pantry was half a package of angel hair, added diced white onion, fresh garlic, one can of tomato paste and sliced green onions for color.  So delicious!  Not too spicy for me, but taste as you go.

This was delicious! I have to watch my cholesterol, so I subbed E.V.O.O. for the butter, left out the salt, added chopped bell pepper, finely diced cilantro, and used minced garlic in place of the garlic salt. Oh, and I upped the amount of red pepper flakes, 'cause I like spice! Very well done, Brighteyz, thanks!

I was looking for a quick, easy crab pasta dish and this is it.  I made a couple of changes.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  I also added spinach.  It turned out great.

We found this a touch on the spicy side. We would give this a '4' by cutting the red pepper to 1 tbsp (or less for bland palates) and adding a splash of balsamic vinegar just before serving. The balsamic really brings out the crab! If you like it hot, leave as is!

This is an excellent starter recipe that can easily be adapted, as the contributor mentioned. I used minced jar garlic, replaced half the butter with olive oil (how can you not eat crab and butter?!), and garnished with parmesan and fresh chiffonaded basil leaves. Bellissimo!

Very good and easy to make. I used about half of the crushed red pepper that is called for to cut down on the heat. I normally like things pretty spicy, but this keeps the heat from overpowering the delicate flavor of the crab.

1 1/2 T of red pepper flakes would be way too spicy.  I used half that and it was enough.  I thought this dish was really good.  I enjoy a lot of sauce on my pasta so next time, I'll make the same amount of sauce, but half the amount of pasta.  I'm only cooking for two anyway.

Too spicy for my taste.  Used only 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes and should have used less.  Could use less butter too.

this is really good!  i was low on groceries and had all the ingredients so i thought i'd try it.  i used only 1/4 cup butter and i used 1/2 rotel 1/2 diced tomatoes.  It needed a little extra tomatoes than it calls for.  Delicious, fast and so easy!

Delicious! I also chose to use EVOO (only needed a few tblspns) and added fresh basil. I used Hot Pepper Sauce instead of Chili flakes because I didn't have any, and chilpolte flavored diced tomatoes. I would make this again!

I used rotini noodles and ground red pepper, instead of flakes. Still spicy and I probably only used 1 T of red pepper.  Next time I'll try EVOO just to save myself some calories and also use less pasta...only cooking for two.  Love the simplicity and how quick this was to make!

Good 15 minute dinner recipe. I used shredded crab, next time I will use lump crab meat. Made a couple of modifications, added 1-1/2 tablespoons of EVOO to the sauce. Used finely diced garlic instead of garlic powder, added 1/2 teaspoon of fresh basil and 1/2 teaspoon of fresh oregano. Used Ro-Tel mexican diced tomatoes with jalapenos, perfect heat, no red pepper required!

Really good and so simple! I didn't make any substitutions except using 1/2 the butter which was plenty. I read a lot of people used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt which I think may actually be better. With the crab and the garlic salt mine was a little TOO salty for me but still delicious and my boyfriend loves salt so he liked it just as it was.

As written -- way too hot. However I was using a different brand of diced tomato with green chilies (Trader Joe's) so I can't say it was the recipe. I also only used about 1/4 tsp of chili flakes. Still - way too hot. I ended up adding in half a jar of vodka sauce (also TJs) and about 1/3 cup of half & half. With all that, it calmed down to spicy but not abusive and pretty tasty. What I liked most about it is it had the effect of cocktail sauce on the crab and took out the "fishy" flavor/smell of the pasteurized crab. I suggest serving with grated Parmesan if you have it.

This meal has become a favorite in our house! I follow the recipe almost exactly but I only use a tsp of red pepper.  I find it to be very filling (and can be sweet from the crab meat) but its always a hit! Tonite, I added asparagus for a little bit of veggies! Delicious!!!

Great recipe. 
I cooked it in 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter. Also cooked with fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt. 
I also added an extra can of diced tomato, 2 small cans of tomato sauce, and one can of tomato paste.
For more veggies, add some fire roasted bell peppers (sliced) and fresh spinach.
Cut down to less than one tablespoon of red pepper flakes. I love crab meat so I added several cans of lump crab meat at the end of the cooking time. 
Delicious!

I took everyone's advice and cut the red pepper flakes back (to taste) and I used minced garlic reduced down with EVOO. I used italian style stewed tomatoes and put a small amount of heavy whipping cream in the mix and it was delicious!!! I made it one other time with some spicy shredded chicken, it too was tasty. I think this is a good base for many variations. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was pretty good. I cut way back on the red pepper flakes, and it was too rich for us, so next time I will use less butter.

Why change the recipe then complain?   There is no mention of beans in this recipe.   Why add them?

Fantastic! It was so quick and easy, and was delicious. I used fresh crab, and I feel like it made a big difference. Definitely give it a shot!

This is a great recipe for a quick dinner. I only use 2 Tbsp of butter or oil and 1 1/2 tsp. red pepper. I also change out the garlic salt for fresh minced garlic. I up the tomatoes to a whole can. I also add sauteed onions and paprika. After all that, an excellent recipe!

Decent recipe...was not spectacular, but a good summer lunch.  Parmesan cheese and basic with some paprika gave some extra taste

I took the advise of others and didn't use as much pasta and added peppers to taste.  I loved it but was nice enough to leave some for my husband when he got home.  He really liked it too!

Way too spicy as it is. My parents couldn't eat it. I didn't like the taste either. I'm sure I wouldn't like it even if I halved the red pepper flakes.

Not very saucy but, still very good. Better the next day. I served it with freshly grated parmigana/romano. For my second attempt I added cooked minced turkey bacon and more red pepper flakes!!! I like spicy. Delish!!

I followed this recipe exactly but shouldn't have.  It was a little too spicy for me and I do like hot dishes.  I strongly recommend adding spices gradually.

First time I made this it wasgood but a little too spicy.  I tried again without the red pepper and more garlic and it was very good.  I've also used immatation crab meat, works great.

What a wonderful combination! I did tone down the red pepper a bit, though. Living in Maryland we eat crab a lot and my husband has requested this recipe be added to the file!

Very good although WAY too spicy for our tastes.  We will try cutting down the red pepper flakes by half next time and see how it does then.  Quick and easy recipe though!
