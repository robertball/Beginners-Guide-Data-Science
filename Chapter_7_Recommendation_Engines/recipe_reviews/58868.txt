Best salmon patties we've ever had!  I followed previous reviewers advice and added a large clove of (chopped) garlic to the onions.  The mixture was more than wet enough and I didnt need any of the reserved juice.  I used 1/2 cup of crushed crackers in the mix, I found that only 1/3 of 2/3 cup, as the recipe indicated, was not enough.  Refrigerating the patties before cooking really helped hold them together.  Other changes: dijon mustard for the dry, dried parsley for fresh.  I added about 1/4 tsp dried dill also.  For the salmon I used pink boneless/skinless canned salmon.  I served these with the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties posted on this site.  Delicious!

With the help of some other reviews, I used this recipe to make a meal that could easily be served in a fine restaurant. The end result was fantastic. I began by sauteing some baby bella mushrooms in butter and balsamic vinegar. When it came to the actual patties I, like many others, did not use the 3/4 cup liquid from the salmon.  In fact, I didn't use canned salmon at all. I had grilled some salmon in butter and onions two nights before  and had some left over. I just picked this apart and used as much as the recipe looked like it could use.  I also added a little more than 1/3 cup of the crackers. (I used buttery Ritz crackers and they worked great.) I also chose to add some dill and lemon pepperto the pattie mixture and instead of the butter or shortening, I substituted olive oil. (I saved the butter for the mushrooms and the sauce.)  Finally, I made the lemon sauce for salmon patties from this sight like so many others suggested. This sauce made the meal. I will admit that the patties probably would have been a bit dry without it. I put down a bed of the mushrooms, set a pattie on top and then topped the pattie with a generous tablespoon of the sauce. I finished the presentation with a swirl of the sauce around the pattie on the plate to make it look like it belonged on a menu in some upscale restaurant.  It looked amazing and had a taste to match.  I will make this over and over again.

The whole family loved these and ate them all up!!  I doubled the recipe and made about 15-17 of these.  I will *definitely* try and find BONELESS canned salmon next time.  That was a bit tedious trying to remove all the stubborn bones...and just a tad gross.  I used other reviewers recommendations and used LEMON JUICE instead of the canned juice--added OLD BAY seasoning [but will add more next time]--added some cayenne pepper--and fried in OLIVE OIL & BUTTER.  I also refrigerated these for an hour or two before I fried them so they'd be easier to handle and stay together.

I used dried parsley flakes.  Added dill, garlic powder and pepper.  Left out the dried mustard.  Cooked the onions in salted butter.  I used just a splash of salmon juice even though I doubled the recipe and 2 1/2 cups of ritz cracker crumbs.    They were a little soft to handle but they fried up perfect.  Very delicous.  UPDATE:  I made these again and this time I didn't feel like making a mess with coating the patties in the crackers so I just mixed all the crackers right in with the salmon.  It was just as good and a lot easier.

I make a version of this but instead of crackers we use Frenches Fried Onions in a can and crush about 1 cup. Add to mixture with Old Bay Seasoning, 1/2 t dill  weed, 1/2 t celery salt adn this holds the patties firm. For a topping we make a sauce of Miracle whip, pickle relish and 1 t lemon juice with 1/2 t dill weed mix and top with chees on a toasted bun. Hubby can't stop eating them.

Needed something quick for Fri evening supper and had a can of salmon.  These were excellent.  Only change I made was to drain the salmon completely for a drier patty.  With the 2 eggs, they stayed together fine.  Also added a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning for a little zip. And, served them with creamed peas.  Thanks Jonnylen.  Will make these again.

Woo hoo! It was a little bland at first but thankfully I tasted the mix first.  I added cumin, cayenne and oregano.  I did not coat the cakes with the extra breadcrumbs nor did I add the reserved liquid. I also baked them at 375 for 8 minutes on each side instead of frying.  Ate them with a spicy french mayonnaise.  Tasty!

Easy and tasty. Following reviewers advice I omitted the liquid from the can and added 2 T. lemon juice, but the patties were a bit dry. Next time I'd add a T. or two of can liquid. I also added Old Bay Seasoning and dill, both of which gave the patties great flavor.

This is a great salmon recipe--nothing needed changed, and I used all the reserve liquid and it didn't make the patty too moist.  My fresh parsley went bad before I could use it, so I just used dried parsley flakes instead and it still turned out great!  I will be making these again!

These were quite delicious, although I was very skeptical after opening the can of salmon!  I've never used canned salmon before.  I took the advice of others and did not use the extra liquid - definately didn't need it.  I also added a clove of garlic and 1/4 tsp of celery salt.  We'll definately make these again!

This is a great recipe. I've made it many times for my family; And they love it! Here's some tips from Mr.MoM.
Refridgerating the salmon mix will help it stay together when cooking. But, Don't forget to allow your onions and garlic to cool first. For oniony taste sensitive kids (like mine), Caramelize the onions. This brings out the sweetness to them. Crunching up your crackers by hand can be painful; And can leave rather large pieces. Instead use a gallon size ziplock bag and a rolling pin. (This works equally well when using corn flakes as a breading.) When using crackers; use UNSALTED tops in your recipe as Salted tops will send your sodium content thru the roof and perhaps make it too salty.

These were almost as good as my mom's.  I probably should have just called her to get her recipe but I thought I would try these because of the high rating.  I think next time I will leave the onions out.  When I formed the patties I noticed how loose they were, so I followed another reviewers advice and put them in the fridge for about an hour to help them come together so they wouldn't fall apart.  I feel this is definitely a necessary step.  I served these with Dill Sauce, baked potatoes and asparagus.

This recipe was a wonderful foundation for what turned out to be a major hit in our house tonight.  I doubled the recipe and tweaked it a bit.  I did not use any reserve liquid from the salmon.  I doubled all ingredients, and I added 1/4-1/2 tsp dried dill, 1 tsp old bay seasoning, 2 Tbsp lemon juice, 3 dashes worcestershire sauce, and 1-2 tsp frank's red hot sauce.  I also suggest adding 1/2 cup freshly chopped cilantro instead of parsley.  To the onion mixture I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic after the onion had cooked for about 9 minutes.  This recipe was incredibly well-received with my family...even my 2 and 3 year old children loved it.  What a great way to get healthy salmon into their diets!!!  Thank you!!!

With the exception of the mustard and pre-frying the onions, this recipe is similar to one I use often.  It was crispy and had a good flavor.  Noted a couple of reviewers deboned the salmon and poured off the liquid.  It isnt necessary to do this.  Use only one egg and all the liquid.  Leaving the small, very soft, bones in  the salmon adds calcium to this entree.  Chop the onion fine, skip the frying and add them directly to the patty mixture.  Finally, I added a tablespoon of salted butter to the fat used for frying the patties to give them a more golden color.  These taste great and are a wonderful source of protein.

My patties turned out awesome...but I hit a bump in the road along the way. I 1st want to say, the recipe was liquidy...I followed everything, separated the neccessary ingredients for the prep. But as I opened my can of salmon and poured the reserve liquid, the can seriously only produced 1/4 cup. And of course, was miffed. So I quickly grabbed a can of chicken broth to add the required amount in step 1 of the directions. I minced my onions in my ninja chopper because of the guys in my house and proceeded. But when I got to step 2 that's when it was liquidy. I couldn't shape or form 2 patties to save my life. So...I doubled the batch, but left out the liquid and the 2nd can was also 1/4 cup of liquid...just thought I'd check. But still to liquidy. So I had to adjust my crumbs until it was still soft but able to form patties. Even coating them in extra crumbs they were still soft but held shape and were still very delicate. Followed through with frying the patties. And they were marvelous. Hubby was beyond drewling, my girls all loved them. My son, had to warm up to them. But did however said he liked them. Thank you, even with the adjustments they turned out and I rated 5 star. If I had left alone it would have been 3 but flavor was still great. But I know now, use the quarter cup of liquids and not increase to 3/4 cups.

I've made this recipe quite a few times now, and each time it gets better. The first time I made it, I thought it was a little too liquidy so ignorantly added extra bread crumbs. Needless to say, they came out extremely dry. Followed the recipe the second time around and only added about 1/2 cup of the reserved salmon liquid instead. Each time I just try to get it to the right consistency depending on whether I used cracker crumbs or panko.  I also pat a little bit of panko breadcrumbs on each side of the patties before frying in olive oil instead of shortening. I serve with a great homemade tartar sauce recipe that my husband loves. Will be making these many more times to come!

My family loved these! Even my mother in law liked them and she doesn't care for salmon. I did add garlic when cooking the onions and added all the bread crumbs and didnt coat them. I also added 2 tbsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp of dill and didn't add the juice from the salmon. Then I baked them in lightly oiled (with olive oil not shortening) muffin tins at 425 for 15 minutes or until they brown and reach 160. Easy! Will definitely make these again.

Just like Mom's, and yes, she's from Oregon!  Good stuff!  HOWEVER, since I obtained my own kitchen, I have learned to USE GRATED ZUCCHINI (up to equal amounts of zucchini and salmon) to cut calories and/or to use up zucchinis and/or to keep the patties a little more moist.  My favorite way of serving these of late is as follows:  with a pile of rice or potatoes on one half of the plate (spread thin), topped with two patties and a BAKED ONION, along with a scattering of peas, topped with a light cream sauce - a good green salad on the side. I'll have to try the lemon sauce everyone is talking about!  Yummmm... As for fresh salmon, fresh salmon might be better tasting in many ways, but canned salmon is good ol' comfort food, and its easy to keep handy in the pantry.....  Ahhhh!

The ratio of salmon to cracker crumbs and mustard is just right, but I changed the recipe alot.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it's hard to get the right ratio of crumb to salmon and egg so it doesn't fall apart when you fry so I give this recipe 5 stars for that.  Changes I made: no salmon juice, no parsley, only one egg, sauteed finely diced celery, and green onions instead of regular (not sauteed, just put them in fresh).  Seasoned with Old Bay, garlic powder and pepper.  Fried in canola oil not crisco.  Also CHILL the patties first and they'll hold together much better.

These salmon patties are excellent!  Even my I-don't-like-salmon-patties-very-much husband raved about them.  As some reviewers suggested, I added a clove of garlic to the onions as I cooked them.  I also added a touch of lemon juice to the mixture.  I drained the salmon completely, planning to use the liquid as needed, but found that the mixture was quite moist enough without adding any of the liquid back.  I also added a bit more cracker crumbs to help the mixture hold together better and then coated the patties in cracker crumbs as the recipe suggested, finding that I needed to crush a few more crackers as I went along.  I used a buttery type cracker with wonderful results.  The centers were moist and the outsides were crunchy.  Perfect!  I served with tartar sauce on the side, oven potatoes, broccoli and a green salad - a wonderful meal that my teenage daughter said she could eat every day!

These had really good flavor with the suggestions of other reviewers of dill, garlic and old bay.  I did take my onions to almost carmelized and that added a great depth of flavor.  I only used 1 egg (according to some reviews that it was too eggy tasting) but definitely should have used 2 for the binding factor.   I made 4 patties but should have made about 6 because the bigger patties were too big to stay together properly.

I am challenged when it comes to the kitchen, but these were so easy to make and came out great.  I did follow some of the suggestions by others.....didn't add the drained liquid, caramelized the onion and some garlic, and added a teaspoon of old bay.  Believe me, if I could make these successfully, they are idiot proof.

As a quick tip, I found 3/4 of a sleeve of Ritz crackers to be the adequate amount to crush. Since it is salmon fishing season here in Seattle WA and my hubs is quite the fisherman, I baked a fresh salmon at 400 degrees for 15 mins and allowed to cool before flaking and de-boning it by hand. Due to the fact it was fresh, I didn't have any canned liquid, so added a TBS of white wine and a TBS of lemon juice. Added some minced garlic while sauteing the onions, a little paprika along with the mustard powder. Don't bother coating in the crackers, just throw all ingredients into a bowl and shape into patties. **A great tip for a sauce to this....take basic tarter sauce, add some dill (fresh or dried), Miracle Whip and lemon juice with some cracked black pepper. It turns into a gourmet sauce:) Made with roasted garlic dill mashed potatoes and it was out of this world!!!

Started out to be too much liquid, so I had remembered a recipe that used a russet potato microwaved, peeled and chopped in as binder. I also added about 1/8 tsp of cayenne for some zip. Success! They were soooo good!

I followed some other reviews by adding crushed garlic when the onions are just about done so the garlic doesn't burn. I also used dijon mustard. Used lemon pepper panko bread crumbs by Progresso. Did not need to add liquid. I cooked them using olive oil and a small amont of butter. Delicious! My family ate all of it even my picky child.

My husband's on the Body for Life diet plan, so I'm trying to prepare more healthy stuff for all three of us... As such, I used maybe 6 tablespoons of egg substitute in place of the egg. I used only ½ of a medium-sized onion. I didn't have dry mustard, so I just used a good squeeze of prepared mustard plus some salt and pepper. I used crushed Ritz crackers and fried the patties up in butter-flavored Pam spray. I forgot to coat the patties in crumbs, but my husband loved them as-is. Oh, yeah, and I made the patties in advance and just stuck them in the fridge for an hour until I was ready to make them. :) Quick and easy. One last thing: Unless you like eating bones, you might want to remove as many bones from the canned salmon as you can before mixing the ingredients. I learned that the hard way when I was a little kid. :D

The one change that I knew I was going to have to make up front was veggie oil instead of shortening but that is it. As written this wouldn't have worked too good and that was well before my one change took place. The mix itself is too wet to start with before adding the 3/4 cup of reserved salmon liquid. I recommend leaving the reserve out altogether. There was also way too much beaten egg leftover so I recommend you start with one. The fresh parsley and mustard was excellent but I think I will even step it up a notch next time by adding a little Old Bay to the mix. It seems to need a bit of tweaking but only minor.

Those who are rating this recipe are rating it with changes, not as written.  As written, this recipe is bad.  Omit the reserved salmon juice and double the cracker crumbs, and the recipe is good.  But as written, the patties don't hold together at all, and they;re way to mushy to even mold into a patty.  Not good.

Very good salmon patties.  I added a clove of minced garlic to the onion mixture and I used leftover sockeye salmon.  Will definitely do this one again.

These are yummy!  There's NO need to add the liquid from the can...if you add any extra liquid at all, chose something with more flavor (a splash of dry sherry, clam juice, or lemon juice).  Add some of your fave seafood seasoning (i.e. Old Bay) to the mix for extra zing. Is excellent with Hollandaise Sauce and sprinkled with a bit of fresh dill.

We love this recipe!  I always use grilled salmon add some cajun seasoning , 1 T mayo,  hot sauce and Old Bay.  The patties are easier to handle if they are made and put in the refrig for several hours or over night.

A recommendation for those who think the bones are 'gross'--they are super soft from the canning process, and a wonderful source of calcium! The get crushed up pretty well in the mixing process, so will largely be unnoticed in the patties.

These were so awesome!!  Here are some changes I made to the original recipe. These are suggestions I took from others who had made this recipe. I added a large clove of (chopped) garlic to the onions.( or 1tsp of already prepared garlic) 1/2 cup of crushed crackers in the mix instead of 2/3, 1 tsp of Dijon mustard for the dry, dried parsley for fresh. I added about 1/4 tsp dried dill also. I thought the dill gave it a wonderful flavor. I also made these and refrigerated them in the morning and the fried them in the evening. You can also make them the night before and put them in the fridge.  So Yummy!!!

Used some bread crumbs - hand full - dijon mustard and no butter or shortening just olive oil to saute onions and fry salmon burgers. Didn't coat them with crumbs either - they were great!! I paired them up with a salad with Blue cheese dressing - "Bob's" from this site - making it with plain yougert & lt. sour cream - Great Dinner & hopefully a few less calories!! Husband loved them also - Thanks!

I'm sure this would have been a 5-star recipe as posted, but I made additions to suit our taste (clove garlic, cumin, cayenne), and baked it @375, 8 minutes each side.  Wonderful!  (I did not need the 3/4 reserved liquid, the texture was perfect w/o it)

This recipe was pretty good. To make the flavour of the salmon stand out, I used some grated lemon rind and added a dash of lemon pepper and oregano. Savory is also a nice touch if you have some.

I was so thrilled after watching the video for these salmon cakes thinking I had finally found an easy great recipe for salmon cakes!  Imagine my surprise when following the recipe, I had nothing but a huge soupy mess instead of the nice salmon patties I should have had.  The printed recipe is not even close to the recipe that is used in the video!  The printed recipe says to reserve 3/4 cup of salmon liquid, of which I didn't get close to from my can of salmon, so I added water to bring it up to 3/4 cup, the first error.  The next error said to add 1/3 of the 2/3 cup of cracker crumbs, not 1/3 cup to the mixture of 3/4 cup reserved liquid, onions, salmon, parsley and mustard.  So, I now have this soupy mix that will NEVER be salmon patties no matter how hard I try.  I guess I will need to crush more crackers until I have the consistency of the ones in the video.  I hope I have enough crackers.  Next time, I try this recipe, I will watch the video several times to copy down the actual ingredients and amounts before I waste a lot of food. I hope this turns out next time.  Please adjust the written recipe before others have the same problems I've had.  Oh, and one more thing, no where in the printed recipe does it mention the patties can be baked at 375 degrees for 8 minutes. Thanks....

Made this on a Sunday afternoon with very few of my staples in the house, including onions .  In a large bowl I put the drained canned salmon, eggs, dried onions (sorry, purists ... I thought dried was better than none), and because I didn't read the recipe correctly, all the crumbs (you know, when the kids are all about the kitchen & you think you're reading it correctly, yet you're not). Moistened & seasoned it according to the recipe. Tasting the 1st finished batch, I added my own sea salt & homemade  "season salt". I did not add additional crumbs on the outside, but they fried up perfectly crispy & held together great.  Looked just like the picture:) Everyone loved them, including the picky eater, and that is saying a lot (there are 7 of us!). It's a great recipe that can be seasoned according to taste & is flexible enough for adaptation (or mistakes!)

Even a very picky husband raved about this one - and he never likes any kind of fish patties.  Took advice of a couple other reviews - used 1/2 cup of crackers, used olive oil instead of shortening, added a little cayenne and dill to the mix and perfect.  Also, used two 6oz cans of boneless, skinless salmon - made prep time a breeze.  Did not refrigerate ahead of time but came out perfect as far as moistness.  This will definitely be on the menu again.

These were wonderful, just like my mother used to make. After mixing, I only needed to add about 1/4 cup of liquid to make them come out perfect. Also threw in a bit of black pepper and hot sauce, just because. I didn't bread the patties, just fried them right up. They were crispy outside, moist inside. Drizzled a little lemon juice over the finished product and dug right in. Thanks, JONNYLEN, for bringing back a favorite childhood comfort food.

Delicious! I substituted the crackers for panko and didn't reserve quite so much of the liquid from the salmon but they turned out perfect! Also, the leftovers freeze well. Individually wrap, freeze, straight to 350 oven for 10 min. ea. side and delicious again!

I've been making salmon patties for years, and thought I'd try a new recipe.  This recipe is basically how I make mine, but I really liked the addition of dry mustard.  It gave the flavor a bit more "oomph".  I, too, usually use fresh parsley, but didn't have any on hand so I used dry.  I think I like it even better since they don't taste so "green".  I squeezed a slice of lemon over top when they were  done.  Super!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Oh, no need to reserve the liquid.  They'll never be cohesive if you do.

Added lots of herbs.  More salmon is better.  Baked @ 375 for 8 min each side & then broiled 3 min each side.

Delicious - I added some garlic to the onions as other reviewers suggested, and I omitted the shortening altogether; I just cooked the patties on my George Foreman grill. I think the patties were even better leftover eaten on a small roll with lettuce and mayo. Yum!

This is the basic recipe I use whenever I need to bring an item to a party and its always a hit! Instead of using the reserved salmon juice I just juice a lemon, it really brings out the flavor of the dill and parsley. *I also add a dash of cheyenne pepper for kick.

Awesome recipe. Yes they seem very moist, but they cook up perfectly. They didn't dry out or fall apart. My husband who, "Hates Salmon" Loved them and my daughter went back for seconds. I changed nothing and served them with a sour cream, dill and lemon sauce, asparagus, and quartered boiled potatoes dressed in butter, dill and parsley. Really fantastic recipe. It's in my save it folder. Yum.

I am originally from Maryland, so I am a huge crab cake fan.  Essentially, this is a "poor man's crab cake," and surprisingly very good.  Once everything is mixed the patties are hard to keep together, don't worry once you put the patties in the frying pan they firm up nicely.  I added a little lemon juice and a tablespoon of Old Bay.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were decent.  I added fresh parsley, cilantro and dill to the mixture, and substituted whole wheat panko bread crumbs (way healthier than ritz).  I also baked them rather than fry them.  I served them with yogurt mixed with parsley, cilantro and lemon juice.

These are really good tasting and good for you too.  I beat the mixture with my hand mixer and did not pick out any bones, just grind them up.  Didn't take long to cook before they had a great crunchy crust to them.  Only change was to add 2 tsp lemon juice instead of using the salmon juice.  Great recipe.

Very good salmon pattie. I didn't have any parsley but it didn't seem to affect the flavor. Added some garlic to the onions. Used 1/3c. seasoned bread crumbs (not Italian) cause it was easier than crushing crackers. Also added some durkee french fried onions. No salmon juice. Didn't coat patties in extra crumbs and baked them instead of frying (350^ for 25 min). Made 4 nice sized patties. Topped with Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties from this sight...Excellent! Served with peas.

As an Oregonian, I had to try this recipe. I was not disappointed! It was absolutely wonderful! I had left over fresh salmon, but not enough for another dinner, so used it for these. I followed the recipe exactly, except added a little bit of garlic powder. They were a hit, and I will add them to my list of favorites. We'll be eating these again soon. Thank you for a great recipe!

These are the best salmon patties I have ever had!  I didn't use the liquid or onion but added onion powder and garlic powder.  I also cooked them in cooking spray instead of shortening to make them healthier.

I made these for my husband, since I don't like salmon patties.  He hadn't had any for over 20 years and I had never attempted to makee any.  He absolutely loved these.  He said they tasted better than his mom's (yes!!).  I did add some chopped green onions to the salmon and a little Old Bay seasoning and a little garlic powder.

I'd do 4 1/2 stars. I skipped the shortening.  I used Ritz whole wheat crackers, added the dill and some lemon pepper, yum!  I also made a gluten free version using Crunchmaster multi-grain gluten free crackers.  When I made the lemon sauce for salmon patties to go with it, I used a multipurpose gluten free flour and lactaid and it turned out delicious! We served it with sautéd in garlic and Olive oil Spinach.  My kids and husband said it was like a dish from a restaurant.  My daughter said it was her favorite meal she's had in a while. :)

Be sure to taste and adjust seasonings before you cook.  I made little balls, and  soaked toothpicks in water before I grilled them.  Then made a spicey sauce for dipping for a potluck, and they stole the show

Very good.  We really enjoyed these and will keep this recipe as my go-to for Salmon Patties.  These were much more flavorful than what I remember eating as a child.  I used less butter to saute the onions and only used a few tablespoonfuls of the reserved liquid - and probably didn't really need that.  I added a nice squeeze of garlic paste - about 2 tsp.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  Next time I'll try a garlicy mayo instead of the hollandaise I made tonite.  Hubby really liked this.  I did get 6 nice sized patties out of the recipe.  Thanks again Jonnylen!

A decent recipe as written for an every day meal - very taste especially with some good dijon mustard on top.     Rather than parsely we prefer dill but other than that make as directed.

Great recipe.  I find that it does not need the cracker crumb coating- one less step to an easy delicious meal!  Went with one reviewers' comment to make Lemon sauce for  Salmon Patties to go with it.  Perfect combo!  Adds much more to an already great dinner!

VERY good! I made a few alterations (including NOT using any of the liquid from the salmon) and baked instead of fried, but they were fabulous.  For those who have trouble with the patties falling apart, try mixing the ingredients and then refrigerating the mixture for about an hour. It makes the patties easier to handle and clling together better.

These were really good. I sauteed garlic and finely chopped bell pepper along with the onion. I did not have parsley, but I added a little dry dill, sea salt, (salmon I bought was unsalted) and I used aioli garlic mustard sauce (from TJ's) as I did not have dry mustard either; did not add any of the reserved liquid because they were plenty moist. Cooked them in olive oil instead of shortening...whole family loved em!

Update:  The amount of liquid you will want to add back in will depend on the salmon you use.  I used none last time but could have probably added a bit as the end result was a little dry. Original review: Be very careful with the 3/4 cup of reserved salmon liquid called for.  I decided to mix everything up without the liquid and then add what was needed since so many reviewers seemed to use less and 3/4 cup of any liquid in salmon patties seemed like far too much.  I ended up using NONE of the reserved liquid even though I added all of the crushed crackers (2/3 cup) into the pattie mix since I prefer to dredge the formed patties in flour before frying in olive oil.  

I followed the recipe ingredients except for the mustard (had none) which I replaced with 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning and 1/4 tsp lemon pepper.  With the changes this ended up being the best salmon cake I have ever made or eaten and would easily rate 5 stars.

My husband said these were the best salmon patties I've ever made...and I've made lots. This was my favorite recipe also. I did not use the salmon juice, just the juice of about 1/2 a lemon. I also cooked them in olive oil, no need for shortening when they taste just as good using the healthy stuff. I didn't have fresh parsley so I substituted dried. I'm sure the fresh would make them even better. I served them with the lemon sauce for salmon patties (found on this site) and a side of steamed broccoli. Delicious! This will go into the family dinner rotation for sure. Thanks for sharing.

No need to remove the bones, they are a great sorse of calcium. They are really so soft, you can crush them with your fingers. These Salmon cakes were very good. We love Salmon cakes in our home too!

Excellent taste and texture. Patties held their shape well and the taste of the salmon wasn't overwhelmed by the other ingredients.

This is a great basic recipe for salmon patties.  Like others, I added Old Bay, cayenne, reduced the salmon liquid to 1/3 cup and included the juice of 1/2 lemon. I substituted Dijon mustard which gave it some added zing.  Cooking the patties in olive oil and butter made the outside crispy while the inside stayed very tender.  I will definitely make this again.

Great starter recipe.  Used bread crumbs instead of crackers.  Added a can of green chiles, cilantro, and some lemon herb seasoning and garlic powder.  Baked in the oven @ 400F.  These were great.  Very moist.  Husband and daughter loved it.  Will make again.

This recipe really works for me and my son. I found that if you prepare the mixture in the morning and let if refridgerate until dinner time, it is easier to form into patties.

I'm not a big canned salmon fan but this was really, really good.

I added a clove of fresh garlic to the onion. I used fresh ground pepper and kosher salt too but no other seasonings. I fried the patties in real butter and served with mashed potatoes and peas. I am very full and satisfied!

Good flavor! I followed other poster's advice to use no liquid from the salmon. Instead, I added 2 tbsp of lemon juice. I also used Old Bay seasoning & garlic instead of the seasoning indicated in the recipe. Chilling the patties for a half hour helped prevent them from falling apart, but they were still a little crumbly. I fried them in the same pan I had sauteed the onions in for extra flavor. I would make these again!

I too kind of adapted the recipe. I used italian bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. I also added some minced garlic to the onions. I used granulated garlic and oregeno in the mix, and didn't use the dry mustard or the parsley. They were absolutely excellent!

Great comfort food!  I added a crushed clove of garlic to the onion when I sauteed it.  I did use the liquid from the salmon, but it only came to about 1/4 cup and, as previous cooks noted, it wasn't necessary-- I had to add more crumbs to firm the mixture up enough to make it into patties.  I also added a few dashes of Old Bay and a healthy squeeze of lemon juice.  These were especially good with the garlic mayo listed with another salmon cake recipe (1/2 cup mayo, 1 crushed clove of garlic, 1/2 tsp paprika, 2 Tbl lemon juice).  I really think cooking the onion makes the difference in this recipe... yummy!

I had a hard time forming the patties -- they were very soft and fell apart. The flavor was good though. I'll make them again, but I'll leave out the liquid from the salmon next time.

These are soooo good!!!  I made these at work today for my clients, and they loved them, so did all the staff.  My clients are developmentally disabled adults and they were able to help with the prep, because it was easy enough for them.  The staff wants to know when they will be back on the menu.  Thanx for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I served this with rice, steamed carrots, and the "Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties" recipe from this site. My husband was like, "I could just eat the salmon and leave the rice!" I think sauteing the onion really makes a huge difference!

I made the following changes:
(1) Added 1 tsp minced garlic (jarred) near the end of cooking the onion
(2) Added 1/4 tsp dill
(3) Subbed about 1 Tbsp dried parsley for the fresh
(4) Used 20 Ritz crackers and added all of them to the salmon mix and skipped breading
(5) Didn't add any extra salmon juice (although next time I'll add maybe 2-4 Tbsp)

They were DELICIOUS!!!!

I hardly changed a thing.  Used three 6 OZ cans of salmon, drained them and the liquid equaled  about 1/2 cup.   I used all the liquid in the mixture.  Added some Old Bay Seasoning, used dried parsley, garlic.   Fried in 1/2 butter and 1/2 vegetable oil.   Made about 3 hours before dinner and put in refrig.   Made patties when I was ready to fry them  and sprinkled cracker crumbs on both sides.  Just Delicious!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1 tablespoon of Old Bay and my can of salmon had only 1/4 cup liquid. The patties were so loose & wet, I can't imagine adding 3/4 liquid. I chilled mine for about an hour but it didn't really help. After sauteing to a golden brown, the interior remained too mushy. But the flavor was wonderful especially with the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties from this site which was recommended by others.  Next time, I will not add the liquid.

These were quite good.  I'd happily make them again (if I can find canned salmon that's not as disturbing--a word on that later).  The spicing was nice, the flavors nice, everything.  I did bake instead of fry them (10 minutes each side at 350F), and I used dijon mustard instead of dry mustard.  Regarding the disturbing salmon, this was my first time buying canned salmon.  It was FILLED with bones, and the actual spine with vertebrae.  It was annoying to pick out, and I was actually really grossed out by the vertebrae.  I don't think I could make this again if it meant having to sort the salmon again.. so maybe there's canned salmon out there that is skinless and boneless like canned tuna?  Obviously not a comment on the recipe, but just a note in case there are other first-time canned salmon buyers out there.

These were pretty good. I added a clove of chopped garlic to the onions when I sauteed them, and I let them cool a bit before I mixed them with everything else. I omitted the liquid from the can, and I'm glad I did because it wasn't needed. The mixture was plenty gooey without it. After rolling in the cracker crumbs, I put the patties on a plate in the freezer for a few minutes to firm up. I think this made a huge difference in keeping them together in the pan. I think these could have benefited from some more flavor (Old Bay, as others suggested, etc.), but they were still pretty good. I didn't think hubby would like them, but he helped himself to seconds and then asked me what brand of patties I'd bought, remarking that he wanted me to "get" them again. :)

They tasted good, that is, the ones that didn't end up burnt on the outside and undercooked on the inside. I have never cooked with crisco shortening before but it burns really easily as I discovered. After I turned the heat way down it still burned up little bits that fell off so the last batch still had hurnedbits stuck to them. Next time I wil try with olive oil.

Very tasty recipes.  This is something I would prepare again. It is easy to make, typically have the ingredients on hand, and it is ready quickly.  I have made this according to the recipe - except I cannot get 3/4 cup of liquid when I drain my canned salmon - and I have made it substituting bread crumbs for cracker crumbs and dried parsley for fresh. Pair with fresh green beans or corn for a quick and delicious meal.

These were delicious!  I listened to another review and added 1 clove of garlic to the onions.  Only had dried parsley and prepared mustard and there was no need to use the reserved liquid from the salmon since they were very moist.  I also substituted crushed potato chips for the cracker crumbs to keep it gluten free.  I served with steamed white rice and a creamy dill sauce & they were fabulous.  We will definitely make them again!!

Yum! I used corn flake crumbs (what I had on hand) and since I found this a bit bland added some
Tarragon. It made 8 patties and my husband ate FIVE!!

This is a good recipe but I wasn't amazed with it. I feel like there is better out there or this could be tweeked to be awesome. First off the mixture was way to thin and I had less juice then they called for. I had to use all the crackers and more to try to get it into a doe instead of a soup. However I never achieved a doe you could shape. I spooned in onto a plate of cracker crumbs. The patties became to thin. I didn't have the stuff to make the lemon sauce ppl are raving about on here. I will try it next time. It was a good way to use up the salmon we had tho. I may try to tweek this later or maybe try another recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Very good!  I used canned salmon but didn't use the juice.  I sauteed fresh garlic in olive oil, used whole grain crackers, butter Crisco shortening and dried parsley, and added a little Old Bay seasoning - my whole family loved them, right down to my toddler!  I served with baked tater tots and they gobbled it right up.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  I did modify it a bit.  I added some green onions (finely chopped) to the salmon.  I also added some red pepper flakes because I like my food with a bit of kick.  I also added a bit of hot sauce to flavor it.  I added a bit of haitian piklese (a haitian condiment made of vinegar and cabbage, etc) to the mixture.  I have made this a few times, and I find that the patties are a bit bland without some of the added ingredients.

Made these for my family last night and my kids ate them all up and asked for more!!  I will definitely double the recipe next time.  I also made it with the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties and it was fantastic.  Don't forget the sauce...it's key.

The taste is 5 stars but I am a little on the fence with that because I had to add a lot more cracker crumbs for these to hold a shape. These are the best salmon patties I've ever made. My family said they taste like crab cakes from a high end restaurant. I used boneless and skinless canned salmon. I needed a second skillet as I couldn't fit 6 in one.

These are awesome!!  I followed the recipe to a T.  But after I cooked them, and tasted, I sprinkled a little seasoning salt over them.  Then they had that little oompf they were missing.  Might also try adding a little garlic to the recipe next time.  But I loved the moist patties from leaving in the juice!

My local store only had bone-in and skin-on salmon in a can, so I ended up using tuna in a can - which tasted great with this recipe.  I had to add more cracker crumbs in order to make the patties, but they fried up perfectly.

Good, but needs a bit more flavor.  Might add lemon juice next time.  Was a bit wary of adding the reserve juice from the can, but I do think it needed it in the end.   First time I have used butter in a while, and I got to say butter makes everything better!

I made a couple of minor adjustments, per other reviews (adding minced garlic when softening onions, light EVOO instead of shortening, dry instead of fresh parsley, etc.) and this was great.  Beyond that, instead of crackers, I substituted some leftover bread stuffing I needed to use up after Thanksgiving!  Their flavor surely added to this simple and affordable (YET IMPRESSIVE) meal!  Topped it with an impromptu creole remoulade I whipped up, and it made this recipe perfection.  Great meal when you need to grocery shop, and and working with ingredients in your pantry...  not to mention, it was impressive enough to serve to company or enjoy at a fine dining establishment.  I will be making this repeatedly!

I bought some canned salmon because it was on super sale but wasn't sure what to do with it. Now I know for next time! We mixed 1 Tbs of mayonnaise and only used 1 egg. For the cooking fat we used olive oil instead of shortening which added a nice flavor to it.

Delicious! Made a few changes after reading the comments:used italian bread crumbs+ ritz butter crackers, added dill weed, garlic, old bay, cayenne pepper, butter instead of shortening and made the lemon sauce for salmon patties on allrecipes.com site. We used the salmon left over from baked salmon II (didn't have the canned salmon juice so I used 2 tbs of lemon juice) and it wasn't too dry. Yummy!

I know I have made these before,but I cannot remember why I did not leave a review.  These are absolutely THE best Salmon patties I have ever made.  Softening the onion is a great idea, but I did not do it this time.  I simply mixed everything together and slapped it in the skillet.  I made the patties thin.  I used an egg substitute due to food allergies, and I cooked in coconut oil for health.  They were absolutely awesome!!!!!!!

This recipe is great, and so easy!  Just a note regarding some other reviews.  You do not have to remove the bones in canned salmon.  I personally remove the spine and just crush the other bones when I flake the meat.  The only thing I change is to add some Old Bay because I love that flavor.  Best Salmon Patties ever, actually like them more than any crab cake I've ever had.

Really good! A 4 as is, but a 5 with a few additions. 1/4 tsp dried dill, 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning, a few dashes of hot sauce, and salt and pepper the onions while sauteeing, with two minced cloves of garlic. I didn't add any of the salmon juice, and I used 1/4 cup measure to make little salmon patty balls and rolled them around in panko bread crumbs. Then I pressed them into a muffin pan and cooked them at 350 for 40 mins. I made this recipe as called for the first time and almost didn't try again, it was so bland. I'm glad I attempted the recipe with these changes. Can't wait to make them again!

This was really tasty. I left out the salmon liquid from the can. Added 1/2 stalk of celery chopped, and a 3 inch piece of green pepper chopped to the onion mix. Also added 1 tsp of Old Bay for a more East coast feel.

Only problem - Should have doubled the recipe!  Family loved these!  Didn't use shortening.  Used olive oil w/a little butter instead. Used green onions for taste.

These were amazing.  I had salmon in pouch so there was no liquid so I added a little milk with the egg.  I didn't have dry mustard so I added a little dijon mustard and dipped the patties in panko bread crumbs with old bay seasoning since I didn't have that many crackers.  I thought the mixture was too wet, but they cooked up fine.  I cooked the onion in pam spray and also used pam to fry the patties for health reasons...amazing.  I will make these often.

Made these about a dozen times now any everyone that I make them for LOVES them.  Once I ran out of regular crackers and substitued zesty cheese crackers to make the crumbs...It was great!  I've made it a permanent change now.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

My husband loved this! That's a good sign...

I made it with a couple of exceptions:

Drained most of the juice from the salmon...added a heaping teaspoon of mayonnaise to the mixture...and a couple of sprinkles of garlic powder in the mixture. Then, for the breading, I used cracker meal and added a couple of shakes of black pepper and a shake of garlic powder and stirred it up well.

AWESOME!! This is a keeper!! My husband who had salmon patties as a kid wasn't too thrilled with them so I was a bit skeptic making these with a fresh salmon fish since I hadn't done that before. So I gave this a try and I am going to make this for now on with fresh fish instead of the canned kind. Make this exactly as it says but I do suggest using salt and pepper or if you choose Old Bay Seasoning like the other's suggested, I didn't have any on hand so salt was the choice and YUM!!Also, since using fresh fish you don't need to add any juice since the fish is moist. They held together perfectly!This is great! Thanks!!

Only added a small amount of the liquid. Otherwise, would have been way too moist and would need extra filler to make cakes.  Added a little garlic salt since it needed some extra flavor. 
Will make them again though!

A local restaurant used to make the best salmon patties, but the restaurant closed several years ago.  Since it's closing, I've been looking for a good recipe.  I've finally found it!!  These are tasty and moist.  My husband thinks they are better than the restaurant used to make.  Thanks for sharing JONNYLEN!!  I'll definitely make these again.

I loved reading the reviews. It is definitely a five star recipe.... with or without the tweaks. Ok, here is what I did.  I added a clove of garlic to the onions cause we love garlic in everything. I smushed up the bones in the canned salmon cause it adds natural calcium to the diet. I only used one egg cause I was low in eggs but I think they would have stayed together better with two. All I had in the cupboard for filler was corn flake crumbs. I used about 3/4cup. I didn’t bother to coat them either. I had a bit of fresh dill in my garden so I used that too. This is one of those great recipes that you can make out of the  pantry when it looks pretty bare. My husband said they were just like his mom used to make!!

I substituted the butter for I can't believe it's not butter and instead of frying my patties in shortening I used olive oil spray to cut cut fat and calories. They turned out delicious and my butter loving husband couldn't tell the difference.

Great basic recipe. I did make a few minor changes. I don't like the mustard in them, did use a splash of Worcestershire, 1 tbls Old Bay, I also grate my onions and caramelize with tbls garlic paste. I always use cracker meal. It keeps forever in the frig. Use no liquid.  Also I use Red sock-eye salmon. It is so much better than the pink. Have to buy 2 cans, as it comes in 7 1/2 oz per can. Made with the dill sauce from here, served with rice pilaf and roasted broccoli/cauliflower, garlic bread~~~ It was delish.

The flavor was really good, but I wished I had read the reviews first and not added the reserved liquid, as others had suggested. They didn't have quite the right consistency, and they were falling apart. I think if I had followed this advice, I would've given this recipe 5 stars.

I have made these for years and my family loves them. I add lemon juice instead of the mustard. However, I tried this recipe as printed to see if it was better. It was ok, but I will go back to lemon juice and add minced garlic as usual.

We use only one egg, 14 crushed crackers, ground pepper, dry mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.  After cooking, top with a sauce of mayo, chopped green olives, and dill. Delicious.

Delicious. Great way to get the whole family to eat fish. I used the pouches of salmon, so there wasn't much juice, but I didn't need it anyway. Next time I'll try a nice lemon caper sauce over them...

I should've read the other reviews and omitted the liquid; I also should've refrigerated them as well. but in spite of my errors, they turned out quite well. I'll be making them again soon.

Excellent!  I live in the south and 'round here a lot of times we make the patties and bread them with cornmeal and then fry.  That is how I grew up eating them and have always made them myself.  This is a wonderful variation on them.  They taste much more decadent.  I just breaded them with saltine cracker crumbs so I can only imagine how delicious they will be when I bread them with townhouse or ritz cracker crumbs next time I make this recipe.  A few things to mention, I omitted the onion and just used onion powder and a little garlic powder and a bit of dried dill.  Delish!  My normally super picky 3 year old gobbled it up!

All right, if you're anything like me, you want to cut corners with frying foods. I oven-fried these. I put about 2 T of butter (I've got a big baker's pan) and let it melt in the preheated oven at 375 for two minutes. Then, I added the salmon patties. I baked them for 8 - 10 minutes on each side. They stuck a little when I went to flip them the first time, but they weren't burnt and I put it down to the patties just being sticky. We ate them with the lemon sauce for salmon on this website and toasted buns. Delicious, but I think next time I will add more parsley. (I only added 1 t.) I substituted dijon mustard for the dry and didn't use canned salmon. I used two 8 oz. filets, baked the day before in lemon juice, parsley, basil, salt, and pepper. I flaked this and put it in the breadcrumb-egg mixture, refrigerated the patties for a few hours, and then baked as mentioned. I really enjoyed this. Thanks!

I have never had canned salmon before and I was nervous about it tasting fishy. This rescipe was great. I did not put the liquid drained from the salmon in the patty mixture because it was wet enough without it. i think more liquid would have made the patties fall apart.Thanks for sharing!

I followed the mixing instructions and ended up with wet slop. I added more crumbs to firm it up, but to add enough to solve the problem would have overwhelmed the salmon flavor. Managed to form patties, and they tasted OK but definitely inferior to other salmon patty recipes I've tried here.

This makes great tasting salmon patties.  I added a bit of  minced garlic to the onions while they were cooking, based on a prior review. The only problem with the recipe was that the patties did not want to hold together well, as the batter seemed to have too much liquid, so next time I will use less of the salmon liquid.  I also had to use additional cracker crumbs for breading to hold the patties together.  These were a hit with my family and I will definitely use this recipe again.

I use fresh salmon that I mince up in my food processor instead of canned.  I also add in some minced garlic and about a tsp. of Old Bay seasoning.  They are wonderful served on a roll with lettuce and tomato!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I only used about 1/2 cup liquid from the salmon and used coconut oil instead of the butter and shortening.  Wonderful flavor.

These were ok, but kind of bland.  I added an extra pinch of salt and some parmesan cheese to the cracker mixture and that helped a lot.

This recipe is good.  I followed it exactly.  I will add dill & garlic next time to give it a little more flavor.  My family complained it was too bland, but I didn't have any left. There was 5 servings & 3 of us.

Good but a little bland the first time so I changed it a bit. I used left  over Sockeye salmon used the same ingredients but added a little horse radish and lemon. I also used the Panko bread crumbs that gave the patties a nice crisp coating.

I too was afraid of the canned salmon but these were amazing!  Absolutely delicious! I followed the advice of others and omitted the liquid from the salmon, needed more crumbs because the mixture was really wet still.  Didn't use parsley, used old bay seasoning and dijon mustard.  yum!

These are delicious! And so easy to make. I used 3/4 cup of cracker crumbs and cooked the patties in olive oil. I also sauteed the onion with garlic in olive oil and butter. Will certainly make these again.

I love all fish but I've never really cooked it.  I decided to try this recipe last night and I could not be happier with the results.  Like everyone else I would probably omit the extra liquid but with our with out these patties were delightful and something I plan on using at a later date to impress our neighbors.  The men don't know it but these dinners we have are serious business and I will be victorious!!!

Great recipe, I'll be holding onto this one.  I didn't use any reserved salmon juice, and I used 10 oz instead of 14.75 but left the other measurements the same.  I added a teaspoon of Old Bay.  Mixture was wet to work with, and I baked it at 375 for about 10 mins per side (because I refrigerated the patties for a half hour or so before baking).  I served it with mashed potatoes and topped it with mayo that I mixed with sriracha.  Great stuff - husband loved it!!

I like some finely diced celery.    This is also good using canned tuna - my grandma made this with tuna.

Delicious! Changed it around of course...Used minced garlic and onion (not fresh), omitted parsley (didn't have any), used Spicy Mustard (not dry), added dill and lemon pepper and used olive oil instead of shortening. Oh and I used twice as many bread crumbs as suggested. I found the 3/4 cup of liquid from can to be too much. I suggest adding this last or a little at a time so it isn't too moist (otherwise it is a pain to make patties). They were great! Even my nine-year old loved them (which is almost a miracle). Also, used the "lemon sauce for salmon patties" recipe as others suggested and that was great too!

Great recipe! Tripled it for a bunch of people, added grated cheese to the bread crumbs, used dried parsley instead, and dijon mustard instead of dry, and they came out great!  Will save and use this recipe again for sure! P.S. make sure to get all the bones out that sometimes come with canned salmon.

The recipe was okay, but too much sodium.

I made mine with mashed potatoes that were cooled, didn't add the eggs, seasoned the flour with pepper.

1) mashed potatoes that were cooled
2) add chopped onion and a 14.75 ounce of canned salmon
3) made the patties and coated them with flour
4) melt butter in large skillet and cook patties until browned.

We would have peas on the side.

Love the taste but had to make major modifications to make them hold shape.  I added all the cracker crumbs to the mixture and still had to add 1/4 cup of flour to make them into patties.  Didn't coat with crumbs, but they were good anyway.

Altered a little bit. I used two eggs for 10 0z of salmon,  no butter, a third of a large onion, bread crumbs as needed, a little less than 1/4 c parsley, and "liquid" spicy mustard about 2 tsps. I cooked in oil and they turned out great! My husband said they were better than his mom's salmon patties!

o.k. but not what I was expecting after the rave reviews.  I used the lemon sauce for salmon patties recipe that was recommended and it was a total bust! I added a few of the suggestions I read, but the patties were dry and pretty bland tasting.

We found this recipe rather bland, even with added pepper; tasted very 'eggy' and the mustard gave an odd tang.  We tried the "lemon sauce" recommended by some reviewers and didn't find that appealing either.  We prefer other salmon patty recipes to this.

Very good recipe! I followed everything to a T except I did not have any fresh parsley so I used dried. I also needed to add more cracker crumbs in order for the cakes to stick together better. I think I ended up putting almost 1 cup of cracker crumbs in the mix. I can't wait to make again w/ fresh parsley, I'm sure it will taste so much better!

I liked this recipe, but I didn't *love* it.  I had to add extra cracker crumbs because it was too wet although I hadn't even added any liquid.  With the extra cracker crumbs, it became too bready.  I'd like to try this one again with more salmon and spices and less egg and cracker crumbs.  On a side note, I liked the leftover cold ones I ate the next day better than the hot fresh ones.

Didn't really like them a whole lot.  I thought it was pretty bland tasting. Tried adding spices to it, but never got the kick I was going for.

I tried a variation of this on a George Foreman grill. Instead of shortening, I added three tablespoons of olive oil, left out the butter and added only half an onion.   What a wonderful turnout! After 6 -7 minutes, I had perfectly cooked, savory and delicious salmon cakes! Thank you for this recipe, it turned out great!

While my husband's review would have been a full 6 stars, I've only given it 4 because I made several changes based on the suggestions.  I used leftover salmon we had had earlier in the week, added all of the cracker crumbs to the salmon and other ingredients, then added a 1/2 tsp of Old Bay in addition to the dry mustard.  I made the patties and then refrigerated.  I crushed the rest of the roll of Ritz crackers and used those to coat the patties.  I then baked them at 475 for 8-10 minutes per side.  I served with a cajun remoulade sauce that I found on another site. They were incredible.  My husband said "You can't even tell these are leftovers.  You could feed it to company."  And then he went on to try and figure out when we could have them again.  Lucky for him there are still leftovers!

Love these!! Pretty much followed the recipe with a few slight changes. I used two 5 oz cans of salmon, so I had less than the original recipe and reduced other ingredients accordingly. I used Panko for the crumbs and regular dijon (not dry). I also took a previous reviewer's advice and added garlic and dill - delicious!

Made this once following the recipe exactly and once following the suggestion of upping the cracker crumbs that go into the patties and NOT adding the liquid from the salmon.  The changes were a definite improvement, although you do need to refrigerate the formed patties to get them to hold together if you increase the crumbs.  I get a craving for salmon patties a couple times a year, and this recipe does the trick.

Sometimes the simplest things are the very best. Very very nice. I have made these a few times and must say that fresh salmon is a hundred times better. Not to crazy about the canned. Also I have made small ones for appetisers and did not coat them in the extra crumbs - they stayed together fine (because of their size, perhaps) and had a beautiful appearance. I also cooked them in canola oil with a pat of butter for flavour. I was able to freeze these, unfried, ahead of time and cook from frozen when I wanted them. They were great for parties, just 2 bites each. I have also made these with wild caught salmon for my toddler, who loved them and the redder salmon made for an even lovlier presentation.

These were really good.  I took the advice of others and added some dried dill weed.  I did make a mistake and processed the salmon in my cuisinart, I think it would be better flaked.  I also used two eggs but I think others might be right that one would be sufficient as my husband thought they were too mushy inside.  I also used a sauce for them from the Grilled Salmon Fillets with a Lemon, Taragon and Garlic sauce from this site.  The sauce is fantastic and really enhances the dish.

We loved this recipe. I purchased canned salmon from Costo, deboned and looking like tuna. I added a few more herbs and spices and cut back on the bread crumbs. They fry up beautifully and I used canola oil. whipped up a tartar sauce recipe from this site ...yummm!

These salmon patties are really good.  I followed recipe exactly.  My husband is not a fan of salmon patties and he had three of them.  They are excellent topped with lemon sauce for salmon cakes which another review suggested. Thanks for a great recipe!

Best flavor of any salmon or fish cake.  The buttery onions are wonderful in this. I like that there is no dill.  I do not like dill.  My canned salmon didn't have 3/4 cup of liquid in it - had about 1/2 cup.  I had to add more cracker crumbs as it was still too much liquid.  I have no intention of changing much about this recipe but will tinker with the liquid a little.  I think I will try it with one egg and only one tbsp. of butter when sauteing the onion.  I did use oil instead of shortening. If I have time, I like to put fish patty mixtures in the frig for about 30 minutes before I make the patties. Makes it easier to form the patties. I tried the lemon sauce from this site that other reviewers recommend, but for my household we voted that tarter sauce is better with the patties. But try the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties as it makes a nice change and is so simple to make.

I have used this recipe 2 times, already.  I, like others, do not use the salmon juice as I buy the salmon in the vacuum packs.  DEElicious!  Softening the onions is the trick, I believe.  Great recipe and I thank you for sharing it.  Found out....I like Salmon Patties, now!

These were good, but I think there was a little too much onion (and I love onion).  They could have used some other flavor.  They were easy to make and tasty, though.  I didn't use any of the salmon juice (mixture was almost too wet as it was!) and fried in canola and olive oil.

Unbelievably good! I did a combo of red and green onions (added green onions after red were cooked). Also, subbed cracker crumbs for Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, added a dash of garlic powder, and like a previous reviewer recommended, added lemon juice instead of using juice from canned salmon.

My husband and 2-year old son were astounded by these! My son ate more than I did! I found them really quite rich, so could only eat two small ones in a sitting, but they are fabulous and were good reheated for lunch today.

I also used the lemon sauce for salmon patties recipe from this site and they complemented the patties really well.

Very good.  My three picky children ate well without complaints.  Did not use the liquid s suggested by other reviewers but did add about 2 tsp of lemon juice.  The lemon flavor was good addition, but the mixture was still too wet.  Next time will try adding a little lemon rind.

Good basic recipe.  For all of you southerners who like a little cornmeal crunch in your fried fish...I added about 1/4 c. and it turned out really good.  Also fried them in olive oil instead of shortening to be healthier.

Very good, even without the mustard (which I unintentionally left out). I used butter instead of shortening, but I doubt that made much of a difference  Lovely balance and texture, even with canned salmon!

My picky kids and my husband who says he doesn't like salmon patties all enjoyed this.  I didn't have an onion or fresh parsley, so I used dried of both and I ended up not using reserved liquid and used more cracker crumbs as others did.  These were very good and they were all eaten.  Will serve them again.

I have made a couple of different kinds of salmon cakes.  I liked the use or cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, give it a little something extra.  I used saltine crackers, and it turned out great, although I think I will try a butter cracker next time.

Very good recipe. I had the leftovers from a smoked salmon to use up. I added some fresh dill and white pepper. I didn't have cracker crumbs so used Italian bread crumbs. The onions add a nice flavor.

Scrumptious!!! I make this recipie all the time. I don't understand canned salmon (the bone grosses me out) so I use fresh salmon, and just bake it first. I also usually use italian style bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. It always turns out great. Throw what ever herbs and spices you want in there... I like lemon pepper and Mrs. Dash. Wonderful!

I loved these, but my husband did not. He said they were too fancy. He prefers his mother's recipe (which I think is terrible). He used to request them often during our first year of marriage, much to my dismay. Hers is a much plainer version than this one. I've never liked making or eating Salmon Patties, so I told him that the only way I was making these tonight was if HE picked out all the bones from the canned salmon-a most disgusting and tedious task. Now he knows what goes into making them! He finally agrees with me that using fresh salmon would improve the overall taste and texture-even though he had always insisted that it come from the can like his mother's recipe! I will try fresh salmon next time and keep everything else the same.

I'm torn on rating this. Flavor - definitely a 5. But as fas as consistency, these patties wouldn't stay together no matter what I did. I followed the suggestions to not use the reserve juice but they were still too moist and fell apart. I just fried it up in a pan with a little oil, kind of like hash browns, and it was very good. But as far as a salmon patty, this didn't work.

I had attempted and failed making salmon patties in the past; they always came out too bland. Three additional, simple ingredients solved the problem: mustard, onion & parsley. The coating IN the cracker crumbs made them crunchier too.

Really easy, really tasty, really quick & a nice change of pace.

I used lemon juice instead of the juice from the salmon.  I only used enough lemon juice to make the mixture moist.  I also added garlic with the onion, and old bay seasoning and they turned out great!  The lemon juice was a nice and not too overwhelming.

I love this recipe.  I used salmon in a pouch (like Chicken of the Sea)which doesn't have juice and added a squeeze of lemon juice, and 1/4 t of both ground cumin and season salt.  I also used a combination of olive oil and butter to saute.  I served the patties over a bed of greens with a white wine vineragrette.  Rave reviews from my husband.

Excellent recipe!  I had two 6 ounce cans of boneless, skinless salmon (just like tuna) in the pantry I wanted to use up.  We used this recipe & it is delicious, even though we are not true fish eaters.  
I used only half the butter to cook onion & added about a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic to the pan.  In bowl with salmon, I used 1/3 cup seasoned (not Italian) bread crumbs instead of any cracker crumbs, 2 XL eggs, 1 Tbs. dried parsley, 2 teaspoons dried mustard & about a teaspoon of garlic salt (I'll half that next time, too salty).  Before turning, I sprinkled a few more bread crumbs.  I feel it took more oil than 3 Tbs.

We loved them!! Per other reviewers, did not use any salmon liquid and also added quite a bit of Old Bay Seasoning. Chilled  patties in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to firm them up. I served them with lemon wedges and homemade tarter sauce. These are very adaptable, could also use seafood sauce or a fresh salsa as extras.. Was thinking about making smaller patties and serving them on  mixed greens (or broccoli slaw, great color and crunch) as a light main course.

I made these last night and they were really good.  Did not use all of the salmon juice as suggested by previous reviewers & skipped the parsley. I also combined all the crackers instead of coating them. Had a little more flare than my Mom's salmon patties. Easy, quick and good-will def make these again! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! Quick and easy...only one suggestion which has been metioned in prior reviews. We used very little of the suggested 3/4 cup of liquid from salmon. Other than that, we will use this again.

This was excellent.  I had some trouble working with the patties, so I ended up cooking them on my George Forman.  It worked well and cut out the fat of the shortening.  I will make again.  Thanks

Very similar to my mother's salmon cakes, except she used bread crumbs instead of the cracker crumbs and no mustard--like the mustard addition! Agree with others about not using much or any liquid--too soupy and difficult to handle. These may even appeal to your "non-fish" eaters!

These were great, but I question the 3/4 c. liquid which made the mixture extremely soupy.  I had to use all of the 2/3 c. crumbs in the mixture then
still strain off some liquid. Crushed more crackers for the coating which made an excellent crunchy crust. Next time I print a recipe, I'll remember to
also write info. from the reviews on it!

I made this last night, and it is definitely a keeper.  I drained a can of salmon, but I didn't find it necessary to use any of the liquid in the preparation.  The final product is very soft with no liquid, but it does firm up with cooking.  My husband ate 3 of these by himself, so clearly I will be making this recipe again and again.  Thanks, Jonnylen.

Excellent salmon patties! I've been eating  salmon patties for 45 years and these are hands down the best I've ever had. My only issue with this recipe is it calls for 3/4 cup of juice from the can of salmon. A can of salmon doesn't have that much juice in it, and that would be too much anyway, so just use what comes out of the can and it's perfect.

I probably wouldn't  sauté the onion very long if at all next time (just personal
Preference) and I baked them at 400 for 40 minutes but increased the recipe by 1/3 and made 6 so they were pretty thick.  Very tasty and no need to add salt if you use Old Bay.

I baked these at higher temp to
oven fry and placed the patties on a cookie sheet lined with foil and a rack and sprayed with cooking spray.  They were just like fried, nice and crispy. I would adjust cooking time depending on size and thickness of patties.  I turned them after 30 min and they held together well.  I will make these again.

Very good. As another suggested I added a shredded zucchini. And used Lawry seasoning salt. Cooked about 3-4 minutes on each side. After they were cooked I squeezed lemon juice on them.

Very good salmon patties. I like the idea of putting them in the fridge before frying. It would keep them together better when frying.  I actually like the canned salmon with the bones they’re actually packed with calcium, making them GOOD to eat! . They are so soft they blend in with the salmon without you even knowing their there

Loved these! I planned on following the recipe as written but when it came to adding the reserved liquid, I thought it was already too moist and was concerned about them holding together. So I didn't add it. I had to add all the cracker crumbs to help hold them together. So I didn't coat them with any. I also cooked these on my George Foreman with great results. They were perfect and not dry at all. I squeezed fresh lemon juice on top. So good!

I really liked these. I added more crackers than the recipe called for and used olive oil in place of butter.

I poured out the salmon juice before I realized it was needed so I used 1/2 c milk.  It was rather mushy and 1/4 c would have worked better.  I added a garlic clove as well.  Overall nothing special but a nice change. I had no parsley but added a bit of dill as well maybe 1/4 tsp and could have used more.

I enjoyed these although my boyfriend thought they were too plain and needed a creamy sauce. I used smoked salmon instead of canned, so I just eyeballed the breadcrumbs and added water to the consistency I wanted. Also tossed in some extra seasonings: fresh dill, garlic powder, pepper.

I used two small (5 oz) cans of boneless, skinless salmon.  I did not use the salmon liquid. I did not have fresh parsley so I used one tbsp. of dry parsley.  I used about one cup of Reduced Fat Ritz cracker crumbs and found that I needed a little more than 1/3 cup of  crumbs in the salmon mixture for a better patty consistency. I made six patties, which I coated on both sides with the remaining crumbs.  I browned the patties on both sides in a nonstick frying pan in two tbsp. of unsalted butter and one tbsp. of olive oil.  They were delicious! I will definitely be making these again.

They are perfect. I took the advice of other reviewers and use 2/3 cup of breadcrumbs. I also added a teaspoon of dill weed. I tipped them with a dollop of a spicy sauce I made with mayo, Cajun seasoning and lemon juice. I cooked them in vegetable oil, instead of shortening.

You will need more cracker crumbs and be careful about how much liquid you add.  The flavor is awesome!  I doubled the recipe and wound up using 2.5 bags of crackers (give or take some) and roughly 2/3 cup of the liquid.  They turned out perfect!  Be careful turning them.  I used a Louisiana Remoulade on top and it was so good.  I'll make them again, my kids loved them.

These were pretty good I guess, but none of my family went nuts over it. I probably won't make it again unless I can use fresh salmon, which is tough to do since I'm from Oklahoma. Oh well.

The majority of the recipe worked...way to much liquid if you use the reserved...i didn't use it all and added a tablespoon of lemon juice..i used less the half of the liquid called for and they were to mushy and soggy to form ..i had to use more cracker crumbs and i dipped them in panko crumbs before frying.   I added old bay and used green onions.  When i make them again i probably wont use any liquid at all from the can of salmon and just a little lemon juice...my main problem health wise was having to use tons of cracker crumbs to keep them together.

Great, quick dish!  I used the entire 2/3 cups of rice crackers directly into the mixture. I also added grated fresh ginger and substituted dried parsley. Cooked in olive oil, in place of lard. I did used the salmon liquid, however my canned salmon only had 1/4 cup.  I substituted egg whites for whole egg.

Tried it as published.

Liked it but thought it was a tad bland.

Tried it again using Old Bay in lieu of the dry mustard.

Liked it better.  Could be just because I'm from the mid-Atlantic area.

It is tough to make a change-over to gluten free with some recipes. This one was sooo easy and delicious. I just subbed the cracker crumbs with gf bread crumbs  could use a bit of a spice lift - but it was gobbled up. Great stuff. 
Was going for photo but it was gone before I had a chance.

Tasted like the restaurant ones, the shortening is not necessary per se, but I did not have enough cracker crumbs so it was doomed to failure anyways.

Just assembled the recipe; haven't actually cooked it yet but had problems. First, there was less than 1/2 cup of liquid in my 14.75-ounce can of sockeye salmon so I could not reserve the indicated 3/4 cup. But that wasn't much of a problem because even without the added water, the mixture was like soup.  I had to add all of the cracker crumbs to arrive at the consistency necessary to form the patties.  We'll have these for dinner in about an hour and I'll probably add to this rating after.

We loved the salmon patties but I had a problem with the liquid. First of all I only got about 1/4 cup of liquid from can so I added enough water to make 3/4 cup of liquid the receipe called for.  When I mixed all the ingredients the mixture was "soupy".  I had to add bread crumbs until I could make patties that stuck together. Next time I will only use the liquid from the can & not add water.

Delicious! I used green onion instead of regular. For cracker crumbs I used Parmesan Garlic croutons for the mixture and the coating; I used a rolling pin to ground croutons to almost a powder. I forgot the mustard.. Oops, but no big deal because I added minced garlic, cayenne powder, dill, salt and pepper. I refrigerated mixture for about an hour. Fried in sunflower oil.  Also, I just mixed everything together without sauteeing onion first. Minced everything, btw. I didn't realize how easy making salmon patties was. Mmmmmmmm.. Nom noms!

These were very good and brought back wonderful childhood memories.  My mother would make salmon patties and always served them with homemade mac ‘n cheese and spinach.  It was one of my favorite meals!  (Yes, I LOVED spinach.  lol!)

very good recipe!  I used Ritz for the cracker crumbs, and switched the shortening for EVOO cause it's all I had.  Added a dash of old bay and some crushed red pepper (we like 'em spicy!) to half the mix for the adults!  Very good!  Will make again!

I served this to my daughter's volleyball team during pre-season and it was a huge hit when paired with Magpie's Cucumber Sauce. It scaled to 24 easily, just use a few fewer eggs and a bit more cracker crumbs than the recipe calls for when you increase the servings from 5 to 25.

Loved the salmon patties.  I'll say that the 3rd time I made these was the best.  I think that's because I converted it to metric and measured everything in grams.  In doing so, I used more crackers than previously.  But I also used only about 4-5 grams of *dried* parsley rather than fresh.  I also used Dijon mustard, as that is what I have on hand.  It was a bit drier using the extra crackers, in that they didn't fall apart so easily, but I think the flavor was better.  Definitely on my "will make again" list.  That's even with the HIGH price of canned salmon in South America!

I did not add any liquid from the canned salmon. It was definitely moist enough. I also froze the patties before frying them and they held together perfectly. I also did not saute the onion but added it directly to the mixture before frying. I thought this was a little bland so would definitely tweek it the next time.

My family loved these and are asking for more!  I forgot to reserve crumbs for coating patties and put all the cracker crumbs in the patties. Oh well, still delicious. Thanks to the poster

I don't know what I did wrong - I followed the recipe.  These turned out absolutely disgusting!  It's probably the cook's fault.  :)

I made these with leftover salmon, and they turned out great.  The only changes I made were to saute' the onion in 1 T olive oil instead of butter, and I cooked the patties in about a tablespoon of canola oil instead of shortening.  Kept with the Oregon theme and made non-traditional remoulade by mixing reduced-fat mayo, triple berry jam, and a few shakes of hot sauce.  It was outstanding.

These were absolutely delicious!  Like some others, I added some fresh minced garlic to the onions and also used 1 tsp. of dill.  Definitely use fresh parsley - it maks a difference.  They brought back such fond memories of growing up eating my Mom's salmon patties.  I will be making these again and again!  Thanks so much for sharing.

I used green onions instead of a regular onion and followed the recipe using the liquid from the salmon.  I wound up having to use at least 3/4 cup of cracker crumbs to give the mixture some substance.  I also had to "spoon" the cakes into the pan.  Having done that, my husband at six patties! He loved them!  Next time, I will add liquid last as needed.

I gave this 3 because people continue to add onion to seafood... and it overpowers the flavor of the seafood.  If I am going to spend money on a salmon or crab cake, I want to taste that wonderful seafood, not onion flavor.  I made these with a small shallot and also with fresh chives.. with those it would be 5 stars

I suspected something was wrong when the liquid from the can only came to 1/4 cup (recipe said 3/4 so I added 1/2 cup water -- this was a mistake, patties were so wet I could not form them w/o putting in ALL the cracker crumbs).
I used Bumble Bee pink salmon; I wonder if the RED salmon would have yielded more liquid and better flavor, as my other complaint is that the taste was bland.
One more issue, and it may be due to a typo: recipe said 2/3 cup cracker crumbs, then later, in forming the patties, it said "use 1/3 of the cracker crumbs."  One-third of the 2/3, or 1/3 of a cup?  I assumed the latter.
I would try it again with red salmon, less liquid, and maybe more mustard or some hot sauce.

so yummy!  The whole family inhaled them including my picky eater.  I made a few adjustments to the recipe:  1 tsp dijon mustard instead of dry, 4 small cans of Salmon instead of 1 large, 1 tsp jarred minced garlic, and dry bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.  With the extra can of salmon I was able to get 6 salmon patties fromt eh recipe.  I suted in 2 tbls olive oil + 1 tbls butter.  
I made the lemon sauce suggested by other reviewers.  A bit smeared on the bun with lettuce, cheese, tomato, and the patty.  I will be making these again :-)

GLUTEN FREE VERSION:  Substitute cracker crumbs with packaged/prepared gluten free crumbs.  I used Organ Gluten Free All-Purpose Rice Crumbs because most packaged crumbs is already seasoned and I wanted plain crumbs as not to alter the original recipe too much.  This specific GF crumbs has no salt in it, so I added 1 tsp. of sea salt (since the original recipe using cracker crumbs has salt in it).    Everyone including my fussy-eating son loved it!!  Actually, he said "there is not a flaw with this salmon patties!" :)  They even begged me to pack it for lunch the next day!

These were very good salmon patties. Because I have a large family I doubled the recipe to make 12 patties. I just changed it up a little bit. I used Chicken stove top stuffing mix instead of crackers or bread crumbs. It gave it a great mixture of herbs and I also added about 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic since my family loves garlic a lot. I used all of the liquid that was available in the canned salmon because of the dry texture of the stove top mix. They were fantastic and my family ate all but one which I took to work and ate the next day. :)

This was good.  I made as directed except that I added more crackers to the patty mixture, which still left me with enough to coat the outside.  This was my first time using canned salmon and probably my last - picking through the salmon for skin and bones was tedious.  If I make this again, I will use leftover cooked salmon.

Great start to a recipe but we prefer CAJUN flavor so I changed for our taste.  I don't think you can really mess this one up.  My changes: I used Saltine crackers (crushed and stirred in), added 1/2c. diced red and green bell peppers (cooked with the onions), added 1 tbs mayo, 2 tsp cajun seasoning, 1/2 tsp. extra dry mustard, and 4-5 chopped green onions.  I also prepared the lemon sauce from this site (which was very good after also adding cajun spices and peppers and extra lemon).  I also coated some patties (cooked thin 1/2" or so) with panko break crumbs *which my husband preferred to those without the extra crunch.

Hubby loved them.  I made the reviewer suggested modifications: dried parsley instead of fresh, cooked in 3 tbsp butter instead of shortening, used entire can of salmon with ALL juice + juice from one lemon, used enough crushed ritz so that mixture was dry enough to form into patties, then coated each patty in more crushed ritz before frying (giving the outside of each patty a crispy/crunchy outside).  I also used the lemon sauce for salmon from this site (w/ minced garlic & dill added to that).  Hubby gave thumbs up!

I doubled this recipe for my big family, and added a tablespoon of minced garlic to the recipe, and topped the patties with a dusting of cayenne (we love everything spicy!)  Instead of frying these, I put them on a greased cookie sheet and baked them at 375 for about 20 minutes.  They were good, but I thought they could have had a little more flavor (I used canned salmon, so maybe that's why the fish taste was kind of overpowering).  My teenagers ate them up quick, and we had no leftovers.  I will definitely try these again soon!

Wanted something different for lunch and made this. Followed the directions BUT used only 1/2 cup of cracker crumbs, substituted italian bread crumbs instead and did not use any of the juice. DH & I both LOVED this and will make it again in the near future!

I made it with Ritz crackers--maybe 1/2 cup in the patties and roughly 2 TBS. of the liquid, a couple cloves of garlic, a tsp or so of basil instead of parsley and put the lemon cream salmon sauce over it.  Even the kids ate it really well.  It was great!

Fixed this tonight and the Salmon Patties were absolutely superb!  Following the other reviews, I added about 1/4 cup more Ritz cracker crumbs to the salmon mixture and I only ended up using about a tablespoon of the reserved liquid.  I used a high quality can of Pink Salmon (about 4 bucks a can instead of the 2 dollar a can Salmon) and I'm sure that also made a big difference in the quality and taste of this really great recipe for Salmon Patties.  Thanks Jonnylen!  Lee

Love the dry mustard and parsley in these.  I used a bit of olive oil instead of the butter & shortening, and 2 green onions in place of the white onion.  Will definitely make again.

These salmon patties were delicious. The recipe was also very easy to make. My husband is a non-fish eating person but loved it as well. I'd have to agree with other reviews that said to omit reserving any of the liquid from the salmon can. I used what little liquid there was in the can and it was way to wet. I ended up adding more cracker crumbs. I also added about 2 teaspoons of Oldbay to the mixture. This recipe makes about 10 hamburger sized patties. We ate 4. I'm going to freeze the other 6 for a quick dinner on another night. I topped the cooked salmon patties with a squeeze of lime juice and home made tarter sauce (mayo and relish) and served it with a green salad with honey mustard dresing. Very yummy and balanced meal.

OMG! these are wonderful and addictive.  I have made several variety of these with the same basic recipe and they have all been great.  We have eaten them several times this week.  I used canned salmon, mixed canned salmon and canned tuna together then tonight I used fresh tuna that i cooked then flaked/broke up and added some cream cheese to the mixture.  They were awesome.  I have to say though I have never added the reserved liq.  Next I'm gonna try baking them instead of frying them and try them with veg. instead of meat just for the fun of it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The base recipe is excellent - and then I started adding other things. Once time I added creole seasoning, another stone ground mustard instead of dry, a third time old bay - anything Ive done has worked and this is so quick and easy for a busy night!

These turned out excellent.  Better than I thought.  I did add some dry dill for an extra boost in the flavor and it was a good choice.  I did have to use more cracker crumbs than called for and didn't use any of the extra liquid.  I just kept putting in crumbs until they seemed the right consistency to hold together.  Oh, also used Dijon mustard instead of the dry.  Great recipe.

I made these for dinner tonight and my dad loved them; however, I did not care much for the flavor.  It sort of had that crab cake flavoring to it.  I also felt the patties were too heavy and didn't cook all the way through, no matter how long I kept them on the stove.

This was so good!  I made about a 1/2 batch because there are only two of us and I had a smaller sized can.  I wound up adding a bit of the salmon liquid to my mixture, which made the mixture very wet.  That made me worried - but once I sauteed them up, it was definitely the way to go.  They were so moist!!

This is best salmon patty recipe Ive tried. I followed the recipe except using fresh cilantro as parsley and only 1 egg. I Refrigerated them (4 large patties)for an hour or so to help hold together better, then fried in the onion drippings. I topped with a blender hollandaise sauce: Put in blender(3 egg yolks,1 or 2 TBL lemon juice, 1/4 teas salt,dash red pepper.) Blend on low for a few seconds, slowly  pour 1 stick(1/2 cup) HOT,HOT,HOT melted butter in and blend for a minute.)serve over salmon. The whole family loved this even our five year old.I Will make this my standard salmon patty recipe .

We love these patties... but I make a couple small changes. First, my salmon doesn't have 3/4 cup of liquid. I've added water to make up the difference, but find that's too much, so I only add whatever liquid is in the can. The other thing I do differently is that I coat them with a mixture of panko crumbs mixed with Old Bay seasoning. This makes a crispy coating and the Old Bay gives it more flavor. Delish!

Added more cracker crumbs to hold the mixture together.  Cooked in Canola oil.  Yummo.  Served with a pasta salad with peas in it.

This recipe is great and easy.  I've never gotten as much liquid out of the salmon as the recipe states.  Make sure you drain every drop of liquid from the salmon.  Then, only add more liquid if it doesn't stay together. It makes the texture of the patty better.  If you use the food processor to make the crumbs, it's much faster.

I have tried various salmon pattie recipes and this one was the best in my opinion! I followed it exactly, except I used two smaller boneless/skinless cans of salmon because I'm not a fan of the bones and skin. I don't think I needed to add the extra juice, I think I squeezed a lot of it out while forming the patties. I might try to vary some spices for fun, but these were very tasty as is!

Nice salmon patttes--could've used a little more oomph--but overall they were pretty good. I think I'll add some more spices next time. Like others, I didn't add back in the salmon liquid and chose to use olive oil in place of the butter and shortening. They turned out really nice. Thanks for a good recipe!

Saute onion in olive oil until tender & transfer to bowl.  Add flaked salmon, eggs, seasoning & mix well.  Use PANKO bread breads to obtain desired consistency - usually less than 1/2 cup.  Add reserved liquid ONLY if necessary.  Shape into 4 patties & coat with extra PANKO crumbs.  Cook patties in olive oil until browned - both sides.  Serve with basmati rice & veggie.  Tastey, good value

I liked these!  I added all the cracker crumbs into the mixture, used the juice of one lemon instead of reserved can liquid, used 1 T dried parsley, and added 1 tsp of dill.  They held together really well for me (I made them ahead of time and refrigerated them several hours).  I made 8 patties.  My 5 YO ate 1/2 of a patty, although my 3 YO only had her required "No-Thank-You Bite."  My husband ate 4!  I served them with a mustard-mayonnaise sauce.  I will do these again!

My husband said it's even better than what his mom made..woo hoo...
I used dijon mustard, dried parsley as I do not have the fresh ones. Add chopped garlic as some review said. And bake them rather than fried. Turned out to be really moist and tasty. We are all honey mustard fan so I whipped my homemade honey mustard and we just crave for more.
Great recipe..

I had never tried salmon patties but I love salmon and love crab cakes so I decided to give them a try.  What a winner!  I used "Its a Dilly" from McCormick in the mix with and that worked well to give  them a little more flavor.  I also used dried minced onion instead of fresh, the salmon juice and egg reconstituted them fine.  I used mayo, more "Dilly" and lemon juice to make a good sauce.  Served them in naan bread with lettuce/tom, just wonderful!

This was pretty good, but, next time I will adjust seasonings to our taste.  It was a little bland for us.  It is great when you need a quick meal though.

I've made this recipe half a dozen times in the last year.  Delicious.  Only change I'd suggest - mixed the cracker crumbs into the patties, instead of breading them.  Also, I like to cook them in olive oil.

Yum!!! I'm always looking for interesting fish recipes. Getting tired of the usual broiled fish with lemon and butter. This is a wonderful recipe but needed a few additions. I used Bumble Bee Atlantic Salmon in the 6 oz. can. It's skinless and boneless and very good quality. Worth the $2.59 a can! I used 2 cans (12 oz.) so I reduced some of the other ingredients. I used 1 egg and less bread crumbs. Instead of using the juice from the salmon I substituted the juice of half a lemon. Also, this recipe needs herbs and spices! I added salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne, tarragon, fresh parsley and fresh dill. The onion I chose was a vidalia..perfect for that sweetness a fish cake needs. Mixing the fish mixture in my Kitchen Aide mixer was key..everything was incorporated and the fish stuck together like meat for meatballs or burgers. I also followed the advice of another cook and refrigerated the patties for a couple hours. I ended up with three nice sized patties..ate one with rice and sauteed spinach, will eat the second on top of a salad tomorrow and the third I froze for another time. I didn't use any sauce, just a squeeze of fresh lemon which was delicious but I would love to try a lemon-mustard-dill sauce next time! These patties would be great on a bun with lettuce and herb mayo. It would be fun to make tiny salmon patties for a party too. You MUST try this recipe!!

I loved the texture of these patties, but thought they could use a little more 'zip'... will make a few changes next time. Very good though!!!!!

I made these for a relatively fast lunch yesterday and they were great!  For a sauce, I mixed up some Miracle Whip with lemon juice, fresh dill, garlic powder, and mustard powder, which was a great addition.

I used lime juice, cilantro and red onion. My husband asked me to keep this in the rotation - so I guess that means it was okay!

These turned out pretty tastey! The canned salmon was kind of icky, so if you are prone to being grossed-out I would recommend you use a cooked salmon fillet. I didn't add any the saved salmon "juice", and I had to add extra cracker crumbs to get them to stay together, so definately wait to add any liquid until you try to shape them, in case you don't need any. I also added a maybe a half tablespoon of lemon juice and a really good dose of Old Bay seasoning, and I fried them in olive oil. Yum! We served these like hamburgers, on whole wheat buns with a touch of mayo and lettuce and tomato. We broke one patty up for our 1-year-old, and she loved it!

My husband would have rated it a four star but as I am the cook, I give it a three. The only reason I made it was because I had a can of salmon (yes, the bones & spine are unappealing to debone). My changes were using cheap butter crackers and dried parsley. It needed alot more cracker crumbs than stated.  Also I used only half salmon liquid and the rest I used lemon juice. I found that if the patties were drained of all liquid it was easier to form the shape but crumbled when frying. But..... when the patty was very moist it was hard to form the shape although it held together better when I fried it. So I would go with moist.It made 12 patties which we didn't finish. Anyway, I wouldn't make it again but am glad to get rid of that salmon can!

This recipe is wonderful...even my picky bf loved it and asked me to make it again soon.  I substituted bread crumbs for the crackers and had to use a little more than was called for, but this made a quick, easy, and delicious meal.

Much tastier with fresh cooked salmon.  Can't stand the soft bones you find in canned salmon.  Very healthy, and the kids will eat this where they won't eat ANYTHING that resembles fish.

A great way to get non-fish lovers to eat fish! Quick and easy.  I doubled the recipe using one part fresh cooked salmon and one part canned salmon.  After cooking I froze some in a freezer bag and will microwave for an even quicker meal.

This is my favorite salmon patty of all time.  I always use this recipe.  I get a little free with the bread crumbs sometimes use more - sometimes less.  I also throw in a little more parsley.  Really great!

We love salmon.  This is a pretty basic recipe but lends itself well to adaptation.  I added a tsp of finely minced cilantro, some paprika, a little lemon peel to brighten it up and left out the butter.  I drained the salmon reserving the liquid to add back for a softer, not so dry, patty.  Wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.

Very easy and very tasty!  I was a little concerned at first because patties are very wet and difficult to form.  But they fried up perfect and very moist.  Will make this again!

This was excellent.  Even my picky 18 year old son stated he didn't like salmon patties but tried them.  He stated they were very good. My 13 year old took a double helping.

These were great- I don't normally like canned salmon, but with the addition of breadcrumbs and the two eggs, as well as the delicious buttery onions, I loved the taste. I do not like mustard so I added pepper flakes. To avoid trans fats I just used three tablespoons of canola oil and they came out nice golden. My husband wants it added to the regular rotation. :)

My husband loves these! He is picky about his "fish" too!  My secret is to add a little shrimp cocktail sauce to the mix.  Like a lot of other reviewers I also added seasoning salt.  Tasty treat for my family!

Pretty Good Recipe! I didn't use so much of the liquid. I drained all but a couple of Tbls. off and didn't saute my onion. I just minced it very fine. I also added about 2 teas. onion powder to pump up the onion flavor. I omitted the ground mustard and just added some fresh mustard seed. That stuff is kind of pricey though but I had it on hand so I figured why not. I also added chopped roasted red pepper... but regular red pepper would be fine. I also just mixed everything in one big bowl and formed the patties and fried them to make things easier. They were FANTASTIC! :)

Good stuff. I made it with left over bar-b-Qued salmon (no barbee sauce on it). I added a 1/2 jalepeno pepper and a clove of garlic to the green & white onion combo.

Pretty good salmon patties. My oldest son (24) liked them so much he even asked me to show him how to make them. I used toasted bread crumbs since I was out of crackers.

Very Good. Onion added nice flavor and I used the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties which added to the flavor.
Will make again as a weeknight meal.

YUM! I added some garlic with the onions, and used leftover RAINBOW TROUT instead of canned salmon. I also fried them in olive oil instead of shortening. I added some lemon juice and salt and pepper too. They have a really nice texture and flavor!

Salmon patties (or croquettes as they are known here) are very popular in the deep south where I live. I've never been impressed with most recipes, as they turn out very bland. I had high hopes for this recipe, but was disappointed. I couldn't get the mixture to stick together, and the recipe didn't make as much as I thought it would. No one cared much for them, so probably won't make again.

This was a great recipe to get me started.  I used the salmon "juice" but wished afterward that I would have followed another reviewer's advice and use lemon juice.  I also used olive oil instead of butter, seasoned bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs, and added garlic to the onions while cooking.  Good recipe.  Thanks!

Very good recipe.  I used olive oil to fry them in instead of shortening and served with a cucumber yogurt sauce.  I also added some old bay and used packets of salmon instead of canned.  Overall very good, I will probably vary it if I make it again though, was a little plain.

I used the canned salmon and it wasn't too good - tasted more like tuna. I would use fresh salmon next time and add some Old Bay Seasoning to give it a bit more flavor.

These are good, and I don't even like salmon! I had some when I was on the coast in Northern California (almost Oregon :-)) and loved them. These taste VERY similar to the ones I ate there in a little restaurant on the docks. I didn't use all of the liquid, either, like past reviewers. I probably only used maybe 1/4 cup, and also added about a tbs or so of lemon juice. So good!

My husband wanted me to make salmon patties because his mom used to make them for him.  i had never had them and was unsure if I would like them.  These were wonderfull.  I cooked mine in olive oil and the familys in shortning.  They ate them with catsup and raved about them.  Thanks!

These turned out so good!  I don't think I used any of the liquid either following others advice but they were still moist on the inside and everything.  I also tried frying one pan in olive oil because it would be healthier than shortening but the shortening cooked ones turned out  better in appearance and taste.

These had an excellent taste and a nice crispy crust.  Because of other reviewers comments I only added about 1/4 cup of liquid (that's all that was in the can anyway).  It was still way too liquid and it was difficult to form the patties.  I would completely eliminate the liquid in the future.  And I WILL be making these again.  They are better than my former recipe.

I have to say this recipie turned out very good. I guess when you sautee the onion in butter it gives the patty more flavor my family loved it. I also use bell pepper in mine and I really like the dry mustard works well and i must not leave out that i used oldbay seasoning I served mine with garlic creamed potatoes and peas yummy.

I did add minced garlic as other reviewers suggested, and also did not need extra salmon juice.  Only used about 4 saltines crushed.  Next time I will add more  Old Bay seasoning (this time I only used a pinch with 3 small cans of boneless skinless salmon)  Also I dusted the patties lightly with flour before pan sauteeing them in olive oil.  Very good.  DH likes this better than my previous go-to recipe.

My husband loved these. So I used Dijon mustard instead of dried mustard. Also Panko breadcrumbs instead of cracker crumbs. Didn’t use any of the liquid. They were very moist. Left it in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes. Came out really crispy.

I’ll start out by saying that the taste was spot on.But there’s no need to add the oil out of the can of salmon. First of all I only got half a cup of oil out of the can and because I added that much oil I had to add another half sleeve of crackers. Next time I will not use any oil.

Delish! I tried grilling using a perforated pan but I think I needed more crumbs. Used cracker crumbs, added 2 garlic cloves, minced, a good squirt of fresh lemon juice and several dashes of Franks. And a little salt. No parsley bc I didn’t have it. Not a big parsley fan anyway. . Amazing!! I will perfect the amount of crumbs and this will be made regularly at my house.

I will definitely make this again.  I did follow recommendations from others and made the following changes:  I increased the Ritz cracker crumbs to 1 cup and added them all to the salmon mix, added a large minced garlic clove and replaced the dry mustard with 1 T. Dijon.  I did not reserve the salmon liquid. I froze the patties for about 15-20 minutes; then I didn't use the shortening, and instead browned the patties in the skillet that I had used for the onion and garlic.  After browning the patties, the outsides were nice and crispy and the insides were tender and delicious.  I added the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties, and it was a special treat.  I added a minced garlic clove and pepper to the Lemon Sauce also.

These are great for using up what’s in the pantry. I think double recipe is needed for a family. Baked on parchment there is no need to fry. Dried parsley works well.

The boyfriend and I loved this! Yes, I made some adaptations based on availability of ingredients. I used 1 Tablespoon of dried parsley instead of the fresh, 2 teaspoons of brown mustard and cooked the patties on a release agent in the pan with a few tablespoons of olive oil. Delish!

I loved these salmon patties an will definitely make them again! I followed the recipe using same ingredients  and amounts except the salmon liquid which I agree would have been way too wet.  However I did add some spices to kick it up a notch: adding 1 tsp minced garlic to onions when they were almost through sautéing, about 1 or tsp Old Bay,  a dash  or 2 of Slap Ya’ Mama, and a little salt to the salmon mixture..  I kept it simple serving with steamed broccoli florets and plenty of freshly squeezed lemon juice

My family LOVED this recipe! I had to use Tuna as I was out of salmon and they were still super delicious! I used butter instead of shortening. And I also doubled the recipe and got 10 small patties. Next time I’d triple the recipe as they went too quick!

These were wonderful and best of all EASY!!  My husband absolutely loved them!  I got an enthusiastic Mmmm Mmmm with his first bite!!!   I did follow one suggestion and add in fresh garlic which  I'll definitely keep in the recipe.  Also, I followed the suggestion of the video and added Dijon mustard instead of dry mustard.  I'll do that again as well.  All in all ... definitely a keeper!!!

This is a simple, delicious recipe.  I use panko breadcrumbs for a coarser crunch and reduce the liquid somewhat to make the patties easier to form.  Using fresh parsley makes a big difference.   For those who enjoy a less fishy taste, swap out the salmon liquid for low sodium chicken broth.  Serve with a generous dollop of lemon sauce (48394/lemon-sauce-for-salmonpatties/clickId=right%20rail1&internalSource=rr_feed_recipe_sb&referringId=58868%20referring).

My husband loves these patties.  He likes simple ingredients, not too fussy.  The only thing I usually add are red peppers, green peppers and onion.  Oh, and also I add Old Bay seasoning.  It's delicious every time.  Make this dish at least once a week, with a salad or steamed vegetables...sometimes brown rice as a starch!

The reserved juice did make the patties too wet so i added more cracker crumbs to hold thrm together..I also added a finely chopped jalapeno and replaced the parsley fir cilantro. They turned out great! Very tasty with an unexpected kick

These were excellent, but I have two important warnings. First, if you watch the video, forget what they say about baking them for 8 minutes at 375 degrees, because that wasn't nearly long enough. I pulled them out and finished them in a frying pan, which is what I should have done in the first place.  The other thing is, do save the liquid from the can, but just add enough to make patties that stick together nicely.  I only needed a small amount. Use your judgment, but 3/4 cup would have been way too much, at least for me.  All told, though, these came out great, and we'll definitely make them again.

I didn't cook the onions beforehand. That might have enhanced the flavor. I didn't add the 3/4 cup of reserved liquid either. It would have been too liquidy as others mentioned. Otherwise, I liked  the recipe and will make it again.  I added pepper and OLD BAY seasoning. Definitely needs seasoning.

Have never made salmon patties before so was pretty clueless but this recipe made it easy.  I did add two cloves of minced garlic to the onion, just because we like it.  Next time I will not add the liquid because I think it made the mix too wet and I needed to add more cracker crumbs.  Still came out great.  Used Ritz—next time will try with Saltines.  Made the lemon sauce also on this site and it was very good—hubby scarfed it down!  Thank you fir a great recipe!

The whole family loves this recipe! I had frozen salmon that I previously thawed. Then, I cooked it under the broiler for 6 minutes to add to the recipe. I did not use any additional water. And, I added all of the cracker into the mix to make the patties. I followed the advice of other reviewers and topped it with a lemon sauce.

Just made these tonight and we LOVED them!!! I caramelized the onions as another poster mentioned, and made extra of the onions which I added to some fried corn that I made to go on the side along with some tater tots. YUMMMMY meal!!!! AND....have to agree that making the patties a few hours ahead of time and chilling them in the fridge definitely helps them to hold together, even larger patties that fit perfect on a hamburger bun. Thanks Jonnylen!!!

The first time I made this, the mixture was WAY too wet! I had to add a lot more crackers. So now I don't add the "salmon water" unless I think it's needed.  The only other change I sometimes make is coating the patties in breadcrumbs, instead of cracker crumbs (I was low on crackers once).  These always get RAVE reviews, even from people who "don't like salmon!"  My father-in-law frequently drops hints that he's ready for me to send more his way!

Great taste! I did have to add more cracker crumbs (about a cup in all, I believe) because the mix is so wet. I'd suggest doing the same or cutting down on liquid. Otherwise, love them!

Excellent recipe! Glad I found it and the family voted to put it in our recipe box to be added to our "regulars". I didn't have crackers on hand so I used seasoned bread crumbs and I put them all in instead of reserving some to coat the patties (to save time). I also used a tip from my favorite burger recipe and grated the onions into the mixture instead of sauteing them. That gave me enough moisture so that I didn't need any of the extra liquid from the canned salmon. I followed the advice of a couple of reviewers and refrigerated the mix for about 10 min. and that was enough to firm it up to make the patties. I used olive oil and butter to fry and I served it with a herbed aioli (that I found on another website--gasp!) because I didn't have the ingredients for tartar sauce on hand. Wonderful, wonderful recipe for canned salmon!

I'll definitely make this again.  I used gluten free bread and crumbs.  Substituted with dried cilantto, red, green, yellow sweet peppers,  used two eggs, but only one yolk, and fried in butter, sauteed vegetables in olive oil.

We loved these salmon patties.  I made them exactly as instructed the first time, except for reducing the liquid.  It is easy to see how much liquid you need if you add it slowly after combining all other ingredients.   I have added some Old Bay, capers and or garlic in subsequent batches, but  the base recipe is amazing without changing anything.

Flavor was good, but I wish I'd just left out the juice from the salmon can. My mixture was so wet that I needed well over a cup of cracker crumbs to make it workable, and they never really got to the point where I could coat them in additional crumbs. I did the best I could, and then I stuck the patties in the fridge for maybe half an hour  to help them stay together, which helped.  I  served mine with a garlic mayo and a red pepper salad.

Added 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. salt. Used bread crumbs, which I had in the house, instead of crackers.  Gave the patties a slightly sweet undertone.  Will use crackers next time. Also cooked in coconut oil. The mixture was quite soft and needed less moisture added. Overall, this is a good recipe and quick for a weekday supper.

These patties were very good. They are rather fragile so be careful when you flip them over and remove them from the pan. They are moist and good flavour..  I topped mine with a  little sour cream and chives.

At first, I really wasn't happy with these patties. They are bland and boring in and of themselves. But they are a good base for a variety of condiments or flavor additions (sour cream with salsa, or perhaps garlic and dill; I personally dipped in mayonnaise and dijon mustard), and they cooked up well, with one major tweak: all that liquid you're supposed to add? NO. WAY. I gradually added liquid to what felt like a manageable consistency. Use your brain. Also, had to use gluten free crackers (as I can't have gluten) and used butter instead of shortening. If you want the patty itself to have some oomph, try adding dill and garlic, or maybe a bit of lemon juice instead of all that salmon liquid. One thing I really liked about this recipe is the coating of cracker crumbs on the patty. That was an addition I have never tried before for salmon patties, and it gave a nice, crunchy bite. So while I thought of giving 3 stars...I will give 4.

Adjusted the recipe slightly - added dill and garlic and didn't add the reserved liquid as suggested.   Once mixed I set in the refrigerator for a couple of hours which created a nice firm cake.

This is a great recipe on it's own, and also  great  to start out with, and then make your own changes after that. It really is yummy.  
My changes were these:
I par (partially) sauteed onions and minced fresh garlic together in half unsalted and salted real butter. I put on a plate for them to cool before I put them in the mix.  Once that cooled I made the mix. I de-boned the canned salmon, added only 1 beaten egg, not two. I added celery spice, dill, old bay seasoning, dijon mustard instead of mustard powder,  I added the onions and garlic that were sauteed, then added a 1/2 cup ritz crumbs, then once that was all mixed up, I added some of the left over fish juice until I got the consistency I was looking for. I then made the cakes, put them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and refrigerated for 30 to 40 minutes. When I was ready to cook, I put half salted and half unsalted real butter in the pan with a few tablespoons canola oil.  Heated that up, then took the cakes out, rolled them in the left over ritz crackers and cooked each side into golden brown on each side. My heat ranged from medium to medium-high, depending on how the cakes were cooking. I made coconut rice and veggies to go with it. This made 4 medium to large size cakes.

I've been in a real rut, cooking wise, with nothing turning out right.  Finally, something turned out even better than I hoped!  I used fresh salmon pre-cooked at my market, already seasoned with lemon pepper.  I also ended up needing all of the cracker crumbs mixed in with the patties.  Also, I didn't need to add any liquid other than the lemon juice.  Since I used all the cracker crumbs in the patties, I just lightly coated the outside with panko.  SO good!

Yumm - my new go-to salmon patty recipe!!  Here are the changes that I made.  I sauteed a couple garlic cloves with the onion.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh and seasoned bread crumbs (same amount) instead of crackers.  Like many others, I didn't use the juice from the salmon, but instead put in a little lemon juice.  The consistency was perfect.  I also cooked them in a mixture of butter and olive oil.  The didn't fall apart when I cooked them, and we all loved the taste!!  I served with a dill sauce from this site.

This was my first attempt at making salmon patties. I could never get past the skin and bones in the canned salmon, to make them before. Thanks to the information in the reviews about the boneless, skinless canned salmon available now, I did it! These  were wonderful! Maked dill sauce from this site to go with them and whole family enjoyed them.. Next time will add liquid as needed because they were too wet using all the  reserved liquid. I had to add more cracker crumbs and drain the liquid from the salmon mixture. I ended up with 8 patties.

DELISH!!   Made these GLUTEN-FREE... (see below) 
* * * * *  Entire family loved these and, for  the FIRST TIME EVER, they PREFERRED eating Salmon Patties withOUT the usual 'ketchup'. They even commented: "These don't need ketchup Mama!" and "These taste BETTER  by themselves, without any ketchup."   As a Mama of 5 kiddoz,  this made my Heart Happy!  >>>>>
>> > Recommended by another review: I sub'd the dry mustard with SPICY BROWN MUSTARD.
>> >  I made my own bread crumbs by processing  RICE CHEX in my food processor, thus keeping them GLUTEN FREE. 
>>> I BAKED these for 20 minutes @ 350 F, until internal temp was 165 F. 
Definitely a new Family Fav!!  :D

Amazing. I omitted the reserved juice and added just a little garlic to the onion.  Everyone loved them. 
I made a sauce with  1/4 C sour cream, 1.5 Tbs of mayo, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 Tbs dill pickle juice and 1 Tbs of dried dill. It rocked!

As written, this is a wonderful recipe. You really don't need to change a thing. I have made it many times, and have altered it just a bit. I add one egg, some garlic powder ( a pinch), about two tablespoons of celery ( finely chopped), and I use Panko. If it is too dry I will add a little white wine. Again, great recipe!

I loved this recipe! I cook for a homeless shelter in our community, and canned salmon is a welcome break from what they are usually eating. We had fresh lemons on hand, so I squeezed lemon juice into the recipe also. Because I have to make a quantity of patties (70+) I used about half the quantity of cracker crumbs. I added the crackers to the salmon mix, but did not "bread" the patties in the remainder of the crumbs. The patties still browned beautifully! The shelter residents LOVED these salmon patties and ate 2, 3 or more patties!

Have made this a handful of time. I do lessen the amount of reserved liquid I add back in, and do like to sprinkle the patties with old bay. Can adapt in several ways if you're in a pinch without an ingredient and they come out just as delicious. I can eat them hot, cold, or room temperature...very yummy. My kids don't touch them but they are picky and don't like fish yet...they don't know what they are missing!

They were delicious.  I made them for supper last night.  My husband is eating the last two on a sandwich today.  The dough is very soft.  I added extra cracker  crumbs.  I used a spatula to put them on the cracker crumbs to coat them on both sides.  I flattened them after I had fried one side.  That worked quite well.  I'll make them again.

As others suggested, I added a clove of garlic and sauteed it with the onion. After forming the salmon patties, I fried them in a mixture of 1 tablespoon of canola oil and 1 tablespoon of butter.  I did not use the remaining cracker crumbs to coat the salmon patties; no reason for the extra carbs.  Delicious!

This recipe calls for way too much liquid.  There was only about  1/4 liquid in the salmon so I added water. These were so liquidy I could not form them into patties.  I added a ton of extra cracker crumbs and they were still way to runny.  I will not make this recipe again.

Delicious..took the advice and added chopped garlic to the onions and used dijon mustard instead of dry. I didn't add any juice from the can.  I tried something new and topped them with orange zest from one orange, then squeezed a bit of the orange juice over them just before serving.  It was fantastic!  I served them with  ketchup mixed with a teaspoon of chinese mustard which gave them a bit of a kick. It was a perfect dipping sauce.  This will be one my go to meals.

Delicious! I added a clove of garlic, minced, with the onions. I used dijon mustard and ¼ tsp of Old Bay Seasoning. I'll try the dry mustard for tang next time. I didn't cover the outside of the patties with crumbs, so I used just half the amount required. I didn't need much of the salmon liquid.

Served over sautéed spinach and topped with Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties from this site. Drizzled more such around the plate and sprinkled lightly with smoked paprika for color. 

This is really, really good!

Fantastic recipe for it being the first time I've made salmon patties myself.  I grew up eating them and just recently had a craving. For this recipe, I would either omit the onion or reduce it to about a quarter of an onion diced next time; I did add clove of garlic to the onions when cooking.  I used fresh salmon, poached it, then flaked it (I opened a can of salmon and threw it away immediately, as it just did not look appetizing at ALL to me). This time I used Roasted Vegetable Ritz crackers, I would use them again. Prior to frying in the pan, I refrigerated the patties and this made the process very easy! 
Definitely will make this recipe again -- w/ tartar sauce or the lemon sauce that other reviewers have described.

DELICIOUS!  Like many others that rated and reviewed I only used only 1/4 c. of the liquid an seasoned with Old Bay.  Everything else was according to the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.  I served it with "Sara's Rice Pilaf" and "Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties" also found on this site!

This was a very nice, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside pattie. I used fresh salmon and found that it was fine without the juice called for from the can. Since I did use fresh the only change I made was a little salt. Oh, and I did need more crackers for breading. Yummy!

We loved this! Easy to do a lot of the prep earlier so they come together quickly at dinner time. Use less liquid than they call for, and have more bread crumbs on hand if you like a thick crunchy outside.

This was ok for me. It needs some kind of sauce with it in my opinion. I tried the lemon sauce so many reviewers raved about but didn't care for it. I found it a little bland. I would recommend, like another reviewer, to chill before frying or baking so they will hold together better.

It is far too wet to form a patty, much less put into crumbs to coat.  I didn't have time to refrigerate it as others have mentioned. I refrigerate my meatloaf overnight because it makes it much better so refrigerating this for hours or overnight makes sense too.  I ended up adding another whole package of crackers crumbs which took away from the salmon taste. Next time I make these, I will definitely try the overnight method first and adding more cracker crumbs as needed.  If that doesn't work I will try leaving out the liquid and slowly adding some in as needed.  I will definitely try these again and use panko for the outside for extra crispiness.

Delicious!  I've never made salmon patties before I used Alaskan salmon and halibut from a fishing trip there. Since I didn't have the reserved liquid from the canned salmon I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a bit of wine and some lemon juice. It was so moist!  Actually had to use more breadcrumbs because of that, but no big deal.  Paired with the lemon sauce from another recipe on this site, it was just scrumptious!  My husband requested I make this once a week. Haha. Thank you!

The taste was okay, but the recipe didn't work for me as written.  If I was concocting some weird oven baked terrine this may work, but after getting to step  2, I had to add an additional 3/4 cup of crumbs to barely hold it together; the thing was basically soup. 
That being said, the taste was okay.  I was looking for something my slightly picky child would eat, and she did so it gets three stars.  If it was just my wife and I, it'd be lucky to get two.

These were the bomb! I have never made salmon patties before this was my first go, but they were really good! I did some of what was recommended in some of the other reviews like the ritz crackers, I used a tlb spoon of lemon juice, and he Dijon mustard instead of dry.  I also did not have fresh parsley so I put my dry parsley in with my onion to rehydrate and a tsp of garlic powder. I also made a simple dill cream sauce to top, but they were so good they did not need it.

My partner loved these.  I used fresh salmon and doubled the recipe.  you may say that I shouldn't be rating since I changed the recipe, but the important part to me are the ratios.  I used half bread crumbs, half Breton crackers crushed.  I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used a dash of lemon pepper and dried tarragon.  I definitely didn't need any extra liquid, I actually ended up adding about 1/4 to a 1/3 cup more cracker crumbs to the mix.  oh I also added a clove of garlic and some garlic powder per other reviews.  I served with some lemon pepper aioli (lemon juice and fresh cracked pepper and a dash of garlic powder).

i wish that I had trusted my instincts and not followed the part of the recipe that called for 3/4 C of juice from the can.  I mean, how often have I ever gotten 3/4C of juice from a can of salmon?  I believe that they meant 3/4 of the juice?

Added a celery stalk, clove of garlic, some dried dill, 1/4 tsp. kosher salt and white pepper. I used two small (6 oz.-ish) cans of drained salmon and didn't use the broth.  I used 1/2 a sleeve of Ritz crackers that I added to the mixture, NOT reserving any for dredging.  I baked them for 9 min. per side at 375, thanks to other reviewers.  My family LOVED them and I'll happily make them again.

My fiancé who hates fish even loved these! They are so awesome and a favorite of ours! I don't use any reserve liquid as it's perfect without it. I used regular mustard instead of dry, since I didn't have any and you couldn't tell. I also added garlic, fresh rosemary, and a bit of lemon peel. Served with a lemon sauce. Yum!

These were very delish. A little too moist to handle easily but they cooked up light and tender.

Loved these salmon patties - be sure to refrigerate at least 1/2 hour before cooking.  For cracker crumbs I used  bite size everything crackers from Trader Joe's (crumbled in plastic bag w/rolling pin) for a delicious "everything" flavor. Did not have dry mustard on hand and substituted Dijon mustard to taste.   The best salmon patties I've ever made. - Susan

This recipe had absolutely no flavor. The patties wouldn't hold together even though I used less salmon liquid.

Turned out pretty good for a fish burger!  The taste is good, but it could be a little better, maybe add more mustard or something.  I used up all of the ritz crackers and didn't use as many onions.  Also be careful to get boneless skinless salmon!  Otherwise, worth it, something different to have.

I make these all the time and they are very tasty. But I use thinly sliced green onions instead of yellow ones. The flavor is amazing.

This recipe is similar to my mom's but instead of egg and cracker in the mix, use mashed potatoes. Then after forming patties, refrigerate for hour or more.  Use the beaten egg  to dip patties in and cracker crumbs to coat.Brown in frying pan and finish baking in oven. Make a creamed white sauce and peas to top as a gravy. Yum.

We always have fish on Friday and salmon patties are a regular, but this recipe surpasses mine. I did sauté 2 cloves of garlic with the onions. Very moist. Will make again.

I made these as written, except for a couple minor changes. I added lemon pepper and garlic to the seasonings. I also substituted coconut flour for the bread crumbs, because my daughter is gluten free. Coconut flour behaves differently, so I added a little at a time and stopped when it looked about right. I also used coconut flour for the coating. 

Refrigerating helped, but wasn't necessary. I cooked the first two right up because we were hungry, and they were fine. The other four I refrigerated till we were done. They held together better, but I wouldn't hesitate to skip refrigeration if I was in a hurry.

wonderful recipe.  I use frozen salmon which I poach in a seasoned bath until done.  I let the salmon cool, save some of the poaching water,  flake it and add the ingredients.  Absolutely delicious with the fresh parsley and dried mustard.

Since finding this recipe here years ago, I've never used any other recipe for salmon patties.  I've misplaced my original printout and had to come and get another.  I make the patties exactly as the recipe instructs and haven't ever been disappointed.  I use a butter cracker similar to Ritz as the crumbs.  However, I don't usually get a full ¾ cup of liquid drained from the can of salmon and have to add a little chicken broth which really can't be noticed in the tasting.  Excellent recipe!!!!

These are really good. If you top with the Lemon Sauce for Oregon Salmon Patties from this site, its even better. I've made these on their own and also had them on sandwiches, both good. Thanks!

These were lovely, and easy to make. I added a little roasted garlic powder, I didn't have mustard powder and they still were delicious. Really good for a spur of the moment dinner.

The first time I made these, they were pretty good. I read the reviews and left out the drained liquid. The next time I made them, I didn't and they turned out very crumbly and the patties fell apart. The taste was fine, so I ended up using the salmon crumbles to top a salad. I gave them another try and made them exactly as the recipe stated up to the point where I put the 3/4 cup liquid back in. It was so soupy that I couldn't even form patties. I had to add in about 2 cups of crumbs to get them to stick together. I used a mixture of multigrain bread crumbs and panko seasoned with dill because that's what I had on hand. They turned out fine. They weren't amazing but I was able to get 12 smallish patties out of the mix. There are better recipes out there. I think I'll pass on this one next time.

Quick and easy.  The only change I made was to add some garlic and celery.  I fried it on a non-stick griddle to save the extra fat content.  Very nice. Will make again.

Made recipe exactly as written.  I used a spatula to put patties directly into hot frying pan as they were wet, and waited a few minutes before flipping. Turned out great.  Will definitely make again but maybe try adding red pepper and Old Bay.  I did sprinkle lemon juice on them after they were fried.  Great recipe.

This dish is very good. I added some dill and adjusted some of the items because I used a small can. Normally my salmon patties are very dry...but these were wonderful!

Wow, how simple can you get. Both my wife and daughter loved it, and they're not huge fish fans.
I added a 1/2 tsp of dill though.

Good flavor. I couldn't get my patties to stay together or to get crispy. Next time I will use more crackers I think.

These were so easy to make and so good.,  I added red pepper flakes to the mix with old bay seasoning as some others have suggested,.  I also ground up pecans and crackers together.  Delicious!

We used this as a based--added a chopped red bell pepper and substituted cilantro for parsely.  We also added regular home made bread crumbs to the cracker mixture.  Used coconut oil rather than butter.  Also just used one egg and added a bit of water.

I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't add the reserved liquid!  The mixture was already quite soft and I had a hard time keeping the patties together.  If I had added 3/4 cup of liquid, I would have had salmon soup.  They did taste good once they were fried up.

I made your recipe with freshly cooked salmon and TUC crackers and it was a 10 out of 10.  As a topping, I made a fresh salsa with chopped tomatoes and onion, lime juice and New Mexico chili spices.  Out of this world.

These turned out great. The flavor was delicious. I used double the cracker crumbs because my mixture turned out too wet, probably from using the reserve liquid. I used dijon mustard, dry parsley, and olive oil because I didn't have mustard powder, fresh parsley, or shortening.

Never used cracker crumbs before when preparing this dish.  They made the patties hold together and the outside nice and crusty.  I did add a couple of dashes of cayenne.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

Great salmon patties however I used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. I baked my patties instead   frying them (less calories). Maybe next time I will use cracker crumbs they were just readily available. Will definitely make these again!!

This was easy and excellent.  I did change it up a little by using plain breadcrumbs as a coating instead of cracker crumbs.  They strongly resembled the crab cakes at a local seafood takeout.  I can't wait to try this with crabmeat.

These were great!  Even the kids loved them.  We mixed all the crushed crackers with the salmon, and didn't add back any of the liquid.  We did put the patties in the refrigerator until we were ready to fry them, and used a bit of olive oil to cook them in.

I liked this recipe.  Salmon patties were very moist.  I added 1 tsp worsterchire sauce and coated my patties in italian  bread crumbs with parmesian.  Then made lemon gravy that I found on side to top patties.  Very good recipe.

Excellent! Changes: I added 2 cloves of garlic and did not use any reserved liquid. I used ritz crackers. Served with the lemon sauce for salmon patties (another Allrecipe), these were a big hit for the whole family and will be made often.

I was disappointed in this.  I thought it needed some more substance and seasoning.  Like many others, I omitted the liquid from can (it was moist enough), and I did try adding some Old Bay seasoning and more mustand.  I used canned pink salmon and wonder whether red salmon (more expensive) might have given it more flavor.  Did fine they could be either pan-fried or baked at about 400 degrees.

I (like others) sauteed garlic with the onion. I didn't need the liquid and used canned salmon with bones, (they mashed up fairly easily), and fried in olive oil and butter. They came out perfectly with no left overs! I wouldn't change anything about these!

These were fantastic!  I took many of the suggestions from "courtney" and utilized them to make it, also did use the "lemon sauce for salmon patties" to drizzle on top from this site.  The best part was they weren't too overpowering with salmon that can sometimes happen with canned salmon.  I was scrounging for something simple to do with my canned salmon, this was a perfect fit!

These were fantastic!  I was a little worried when I saw that my mixture was really wet.  But, they held up while frying in the skillet.  I forgot to add the parsley...won't forget to next time.  Great flavor and we really enjoyed these!

This was a nice alternative recipe to my usual, ho-hum salmon patties.  These were much more flavorful and made me feel that I did a little more to make a healthy meal even better!  Great recipe!

I used this recipe as a guideline and used left over salmon.(I have never been a big fan of canned)I also used green onions instead of white and added garlic. I didn't need any extra liquid and they held together nicely. This is a great way to use up left over salmon!

This recipe was excellent, *but* I made a few changes.  I added the following to a DOUBLED recipe.  I put in 2 cloves of minced garlic and 4 chopped green onions when I sauteed the yellow onions.  To the fish mixture, I added 1 tsp salt, a few grinds of black pepper, 1 tsp Old Bay, 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard (instead of dry mustard), juice of 1/2 lemon.  I did not bother breading the salmon cakes (too much fuss), but waited until the oil was nice and hot, then browned both sides of each patty.  Both my husband and my daughter gave these patties a thumbs up!!

This was ok with my kids ages 1(who ate the most),4&7, which is most important to me. They simply ate it with just a little coaxing as it was something new and different for them. I made it with several different suggestions from the reviews because I didn't have dry mustard or parsley-used some Old Bay & dill weed also I used 2 pouch packs of no bone salmon which was 12oz combined, so I didn't have the liquid reserve to use,used 2-3 tbs lemon juice instead. I plan on making this occasionally as I am trying to include fish once a week for dinner.

I'm very impressed with these since it took something kind of gross - canned salmon, and turned it into a yummy dinner.  I made it just as written except sauted the onions in olive oil instead of butter.  They were good and everyone had seconds (except for my 5 year old - which, unless it has a big "M" on it purchased at a drive thru, she won't approve).  I served them with the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties as a previous reviewer suggested and it was a quick-to-fix, moderately healthy, meal.  Thanks!!

Wow!  These were very tasty!  I added some fresh chives and dill, and some dried dill.  I did use all the liquids, but needed to add extra bread (instead of cracker) crumbs.  My batch made eight patties.  Will have leftovers on buns for tomorrow's dinner.

Update: I've made this recipe several times! We love them.

This is the only recipe I use for salmon patties! I usually don't have fresh parsley on hand, so I use dried and it always comes out just fine. I also took some of the other posters advice and tap a little bit of 'Old Bay' seasoning over the patties before I fry them.

To make it a little more 'Kid Friendly' I crush up about a 1/4 cup of the colored goldfish crackers and put them in with the other crackers to coat - my kids say that they have "sprinkles" that way, and it tastes about the same.
I also serve it with the Salmon Patty Sauce from this site and it makes it even more delicious.

Delicious!!  I used all the liquid that was in the can, I had maybe a bit less than half a cup; I found it to be just enough liquid.  The patties were crispy on the outside and nice & moist inside - perfect!  However next time I might replace that liquid with plain canola oil because the patties were a tad salty (but nothing drastic).  I served them with white rice, sliced tomatoes & a mayonnaise/yogurt/garlic/ketchup sauce.  YUM!

This came out very well, I cooked some salmon and then flaked it for this recipe instead of using canned. Then I took the patties and made them into sandwiches.

These were EXCELLENT!  The BEST salmon patties I've had.. Although I did make some changes!  First, there is not 3/4 cup of juice in the can of salmon, but that was ok because even with the little bit there was made it too moist and I ended up adding the whole 2/3 cup of cracker crumbs to the mix and just crushed up some more for coating.  Second, I didn't have fresh parsley so I used the dried.  And Third, I took advise from other reviewers and added 1 tsp. of dill weed.  Like I said, "these were FANTASTIC!"  I will definitely make again!!

This recipe turned out great.  I am a pretty good cook but never thought of using mustard in salmon although I marinate my chicken with it. I did change a few things but only because I didn't feel like going to the store.  I used green and red peppers, red rooster hot sauce, spicy brown mustard, green onions, and toasted bread instead.  I cooked my veggies prior to putting it all together.

These were a little bland to our taste. I ended up adding 1 tsp of creole seasoning to the mix. Next time I will probably add some cayenne pepper to spice them up a bit and some fresh garlic cooked in with the onion.

Very tasty! The measurements were perfect. Instead of dry mustard, I used Dijon. Added a little cayenne powder based on a suggestion and 1-2 tsp of fresh squeezed lemon juice. I skipped the parsley to save a buck. Fried the patties in vegetable oil. I made the recipe GLUTEN FREE for my husband by using potato chips instead of bread crumbs. That worked great! Served with roasted asparagus.

Followed the recipe with the exception of using butter/olive oil instead of shortening. Found the mix to be too wet when trying to make patties. Had to add 'alot' of bread crumbs to help out. Recipe came out ok in the end.

I modified this since I only had a 7 oz can of boneless salmon. Also added a sprinkle of lemon pepper to the mix before adding the crumbs.

I made these for lunch and served them on a bun with some lemon mayo, tomato & lettuce.

Delish!!

I was half numb when we ate these (dentist) but my fiancé RAVED about them! They were pretty good in my opinion, even though I totally forgot the eggs! They fell apart a little bit because of that but I don't think the flavor was diminished much by the omission.

I made this for dinner tonight and I who don't eat fish loved it.  I accidentaly used a 7 oz. can and couldn't figure out why it was so wet, I added alot of italian bread crumbs too it and it was great.  My husband wants me to add bacon to it the next time, I will try.

I always tweek.  I slice up mushrooms,onions, zucc, red peppers and celery then use my alligator chopper to get them in a nice small dice.  Saute those quickly then add to the salmon.  No salmon liquid. Crumbs only on the outside and cook in a bit of evoo.  Serve on buns with aioli or remoulade.  Makes a great school lunch.

Made this for dinner last night with 3 6 oz. cans of salmon. I added the juice and grated rind of 1/2 lemon, and only added about 3 tbsps of the reserved liquid. I followed others suggestions and refrigerated them for several hours (which I think also helped meld the flavors). Served it with the lemon tarragon sauce (substituted dill for the tarragon). My husband, who is a food snob, told me he didn't use the sauce because the patties were excellent on their own. Great recipe Jonnylen and it will become a staple.

These were awesome! I like many others pretty much did my own variation. I completely omitted the butter and shortening, instead frying with a little olive oil in a non-stick pan. Also I just used Dijon mustard since that was what i had on hand. Added a little dill, fresh squeezed lemon juice, minced garlic, and a dash of Franks red hot sauce. Restaurant quality!

Didn't have any parsley so used oregeno and a bit of Old Bay and wet mustard for the seasoning.  Overcooked them slightly so they ended up a bit dry but everyone found them tasty.  Will make again.

I made these using canned salmon.  I have to be fair and say I don't like salmon.  It was fishy and my kids took one bite and spit it out.  Probably not because of the recipe but because of our dislike of the fish in the first place.

I thought these were awesome! A little on the dry side, so next time I think I'll take the advice of another reviewer and make the lemon sauce to put on top. Thanks!

These are the best Salmon patties we have ever tried.  Very moist.  I used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs, added a tsp of dill, and cooked them in extra-virgin olive oil instead of cooking oil.

WONDERFUL. I DID NOT HAVE FRESH PARSLEY, WHICH I'M SURE WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS TO THE T THE ONLY THING I DID ADD WAS A LITTLE LEMON JUICE AND SALT AND PEPPER. WE ATE THEM WITH A SIMPLE TARTER SAUCE. MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH LOVED THEM. THIS IS MY RECIPE FOR SALMON PATTIES FROM NOW ON.

This was my first attempt at making salmon patties and they turned out great.  I used boneless/skinless salmon, prepared mustard, and italian style bread crumbs.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I didn't get 3/4 cup of liquid out of a can of salmon, I got a little less than 1/2 a cup.  Then, when it came time to add the "juice" (which I used a little water to make the 3/4 cup), I was extremely worried that this would make the mixture too soupy.  It did.  I wound up putting the mixture through a fine strainer, just to get off the unnecessary liquid.  After browning the patties, which looked lovely, I was disappointed by a rather bland, uninteresting flavor.  The salmon patties were promptly smothered in home made tartar sauce. I would recommend using some lemon juice in place of the broth, adding just enough to help the fish stick together and lend some much needed flavor to the recipe.  I think adding some salt to the mixture would also improve the flavor.  I will be trying this recipe again, but only with these changes!

My husband loved these salmon patties.  They were so easy to make and used simple, always-on-hand ingredients.  I used Ritz crackers for the cracker crumbs and cooked them in an olive oil/butter combination instead of shortening.   I used canned pink salmon when preparing this recipe for the first time, and I will be using FRESH salmon fillets the next time I make them.  I'm not a fan of the canned salmon at all...

Turned out great. I was out of onion so I substitued celery (not sauted) and used ceasar croutons for the cracker crumbs. If using frozen salmon, I also recommend not adding any extra liquid. Good flavor. Thanks!

Liked a lot but the kids did not.  I was glad I read reviews and I also did not use the reserved liquid which was good because they would never have held together.  Next time I will add some Old Bay seasoning because they were a little bland.  I also had a lot of cracker crumbs leftover so I will decrease that amount also.

This was good.  I thought it could use some salt but maybe that is because I used unsalted crackers.  Left out parsley because I didn't have any and used olive oil instead of shortening.  Good recipe.  Thank you.

I made this recipe last night. We loved it! I converted it into a healthy version. I used Smart Balance butter in it and did not fry them. I used a large griddle with cooking spray to cook many at once. I also used fat-reduced crackers in it. I used dried minced onions instead of real ones. My daughter didnt like the fresh parsley either so I think I will try dried parsley next time. I served them with turkey gravy over top of them and my husband loved them! This will be a frequently made meal at my house from now on. Simple to make and good priced!

I, like everyone, used no extra liquid as I used fresh salmon for this recipe. I added a little chipolte lime mustard to the bread crumb coating, and some Mrs Dash to the salmon mixture (no Old Bay Seasoning in the house). The finished patty was firm and meaty, very yummy. I think this would be good with or without a sauce to accompany it.

I used the left over salmon from the Easy Salmon recipe and still thought there was something missing.   Still lacked flavor and the patties did not hold up well for me.  Guess it was not been a good batch of recipes for me and my household.

I remember eating Salmon patties growing up, so I was so excited to find this recipe. I used italian breadcrumbs instead of cracker crumbs and omitted the parsley. I think they could have used some salt, so I'll add that next time. I cooked them in olive oil, they turned out great. They went great with a salad.

These were really good!  I used crushed up sour cream and onion potato chips for half of the cracker crumbs and, like everyone else, didn't use the liquid.  Also, I cooked them in olive oil.
