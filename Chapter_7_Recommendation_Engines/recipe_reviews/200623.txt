Quite good.   I put the sugar and vanilla to dissolve with the hot coffee and don't bother with the boiling water.  Once it chilled in the fridge, I added 1 cup of 1% milk since I'm not crazy about cream. Will make again -- thanks!

During the summer, I make pitchers of this and leave it cool in the fridge for long summer days/nights. Now that I'm  trying to get my pre-baby body as close to what it was before babies, I now will use FF half and half and Splenda. My husband can't even tell that it's lower in fat. I fight with him over the leftovers in the pitcher. NOTE: You can also use FF/SF creamers and cut back on the sugar, which I find on the cheap at my local outlet store.

This is awesome, I did however make a few changes to keep it low calorie.  Substitute Truvea, Stevia or any other sugar substitute and I use skim milk instead of cream.  Very delicious and light on a hot summer morning.  Other Iced coffees can feel too heavy for the heat. Calories are now under 50 per 8 oz glass over ice.

Wow is this stuff ever good, and I don't even drink coffee but I love it cold!  This is so good and a great pick me up in the afternoon - much cheaper than Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts for that matter! I made this exactly as the recipe stated and topped it with whipped cream and chocolate shavings (I know really bad), but next time I'll health it up a bit and sub in Splenda and fat free half and half (forget the whipped cream and chocolate shavings).  Great recipe!

Omg! The reaction to this was unanimous. ‘Just like Tim Hortons!’ It really, really is! Maybe it’s the vanilla. Maybe it’s the cream. I don’t know. Frankly, my dear, I don’t care. What matters is that it’s delicious, easy, and cures those heat wave, ho-hum blues. I didn’t have to switch it up or change the recipe at all. Perfect just dumped all together in a pitcher. The most important thing is serving it at sub-arctic temperatures. :)

Refreshing! Simple!  I have used Equal instead of the sugar and use fat free half & half and it still delicious. I, too, mix it and keep it handy in the fridge.  I even used caramel ice cream topping in place of the vanilla - awesome.  Using flavored coffee creamer makes it easy to change the flavors.

This is very good!  I cold-brewed a very strong coffee and could not really taste the vanilla.  I will add a bit more next time.  I also used only 1 Tbs. Half & Half per serving, but again I like strong coffee.  I will make this again (and again)!

This was way too sweet for me. Or maybe this is an acquired taste that I just don't have.

Awesome Iced Coffee!  Tastes just like the bottled Starbucks Iced Coffee you buy in the grocery store!  We make a big batch of it and use it all week for a cool drink.  We just use regular milk, not cream.  Thinking about trying other flavors besides vanilla... Great Recipe!!!

this was really good!! I made it on a beautiful sunny morning so it was just perfect for that day. It is not overwhelmingly sweet like sarah said. Just sweet enough and the vanilla adds a nice touch. I added whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon to the top too.

I followed a tip by another cook and chilled a whole pot of coffee ahead of time. I used skim milk and Splenda to taste with the vanilla and WOW!  I can't imagine how delicious the original version is if the light version is this good!

1. Making sure to brew the coffee strong. (Adding the ice later on dilutes the coffee.) 2. I just added the sugar while the coffee was still hot so that I did not have the step of making the simple syrup later. 3. If you want to make it CHOCOLATE flavored instead of vanilla add a few tablespoons of good old chocolate syrup before you chill the coffee.

This is delicious. I dissolved the sugar into the coffee while it was still hot, and used 2% milk since that's what I had on hand. I simply mixed it all up in a pitcher and kept in in the fridge for when I wanted some iced coffee.

This is really good for a hot summer day.  I increased the amount of vanilla to 1 tsp. because I like vanilla flavored coffee. The reality is, this is only as good as the coffee that comes out of your coffee pot.  If you want a rich gourmet flavor, you have to start with gourmet coffee.

I just add the sugar and vanilla and cream/milk to hot coffee and chill. Serve it over ice. Delicious and sooo simple! I had to add a bit more sugar since I used an expresso roast coffee and made it very strong. I think I added about 1/3 cup.

I scaled this down to one cup and just boiled 1 tablespoon sugar with 1 tablespoon water, which did not take but a minute.  I also used half and half and just about 4 or five large ice cubes.  It's probably a good idea to have a simple syrup made ahead to always have this on hand for this delicious drink!  Thank you.

So good!  I followed another users suggestion to pour the sugar mixture into the coffee and cool it altogether.  I only had French Vanilla coffee creamer on hand and that made it taste great!  I don't need to go to McDonald's or Starbucks for iced coffee again!

This is soooo good! I made it pretty similar t the recipe- with just a couple simplifications.  I brewed coffee- extra strong.  While the coffee was hot I stirred in the vanilla and sugar and then put it in the fridge.  Ater it cools, I just put in 1/2 glass of coffee with some ice cubes and about 1/2 c. skim milk.  PERFECT.   I will make one change next batch, a bit less sugar.  I like my coffee sweet- but only slightly- this is sweetier than my taste allows.  Still I just LOVE this.  It will be a staple in my fridge for the summer.

Sarah, you are my savior. I've been looking for iced coffee recipes that aren't to acidic or watery and this one is perfect! Along with the vanilla extract I added some Torani's caramel syrup and it tasted amazing. Thank you for the great jumping point!! 5 stars all the way!

Rather than mixing the sugar with boiling water, I used SPLENDA granulated (which dissolves perfectly) and used milk in place of the cream (I'm sure cream would have been More Delicious). So easy & a great morning pick-me-up for us "non-coffee" drinkers.

I made this with milk but otherwise followed the directions. It is really good. Very much like what I would get at Mcds or other places. I made a whole pitcher and see how is holds up. I also like I could use calorie free sweetener and skim milk to make it better for me.

This was the best/easiest iced coffee recipe I have found!  I skipped dissolving sugar in water and just added all ingredients to the hot coffee and cooled for about an hour.  Perfect as is, or add 1 tbsp of chocolate syrup for a "mocha"!  Thank you Sara!

We used this recipe for a Relay For Life booth along 2 other iced coffee recipes from this site.  It started out strong, but people said it tasted like bottled from a gas station and didn't have good flavor. There were no repeat customers for this one. :( I am not a coffee drinker, so based this off of the customers.

I followed the basic recipe, but added the sugar and vanilla directly to the hot coffee as suggested by others.  I mixed my cooled coffee with Mudslide creamer - yum!

Great taste and easy to make.  I even dissolved a little mocha power into the hot coffee to give it a chocolate taste.

Very good, like the others I forgo the boiling water, and used 2% milk.  A lil different than the exact recipe but so yum!  Will take this with for the Memorial Weekend to share with my sisters.  I think they will enjoy it as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

We liked this, but I would make it a tad sweeter,  maybe 1/3 cup sugar next time...  I also didn't use cream, just regular milk.  It's worth making again!

I used a sample of Teeccino's Maya Chai dark roast herbal coffee instead because I wanted to try it in this instead (didn't taste that great as a hot beverage) of regular. I also topped it off with frozen whipped topping, nutmeg and cinnamon. Once I drank a little out of the glass, I mixed it all in. Definitely boosted the flavour! I used the vanilla extract in the syrup portion, and omitted the ice. This is being added to my summer drinks rotation for sure, and with regular coffee next time!

It's late October and the temperature is in the mid 90's, this Iced Coffee is perfect for cooling down.  I mixed all ingredients (except ice) in a pitcher, using 24 Splenda packets instead of sugar and substituting Fat Free & Sugar Free International Delight French Vanilla Coffee Creamer for the cream. I absolutely loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe.

So refreshing, I used milk instead of cream and only added about 2 tbls sugar. I made a pitcher of it to keep in the fridge. It didn't last long. I will never go to Timmies or Starbucks for iced coffee again.

This is a great basic recipe.  I like to add funky Coffee-Mate flavors especially during the Fall season...sometimes I serve it hot or sometimes cold, depending on my mood. Try one of these yummy variations with Coffee-Mate:  Warm Cinnamon Sugar Cookie, Peppermint Mocha or
Brown Sugar Maple Latte.  Delicious!

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and just made two cups of instant coffee to make it easy on myself. I also used whole milk instead of cream and it was fabulous!

I have been sampling a LOT of recipes trying to find one that really does taste good and this is the best one I have found so far.  The only thing I did different was use a cold brew coffee and I substituted 1 teaspoon vanilla syrup.

I LOVE THIS!!!!  I have been addicted to bottled starbucks iced coffee for years and it has been a waste of money. Nomore stops by the gas station on my way to work to waste $2-3 every morning when I can make this at home. I did mix the coffee, vanilla, sugar and milk then store in fridge and pour over ice each morning.

Pretty good. I don't keep cream on hand so I had to use 2% milk. Not as rich as I would have liked it, but it was a nice treat and a great way to use left over brewed coffee from breakfast.

This was so yummy!  Even my husband loved it.  Like others I left out the boiling water and just added the vanilla and sugar when the coffee was hot.  I substituted 1% milk for the cream and it was still delish.  We usually drink our coffee black, so I might use a little less sugar next time - just personal taste.  I will definitely be making this again!

The vanilla is an excellent idea! I try to go light on the coffee flavor, so I usually do two spoonfuls instant granules, three spoonfuls sugar and milk over ice. Nice and sweet - and now that hint of vanilla makes it taste fancy! ~UPDATE~ If you're not a vanilla person, try any flavor syrup. I just made iced coffee with 2 Tbspn Torani's Irish Cream - it's heaven!

THE BEST, My husband suprised me by looking this recipe up by himself :) and making it for me, DELICIOUS!! we make it all the time, if we have left over coffee we refridgerate it and make the syrup part of the recipe, combine and have iced coffee on hand most days so yummy thanks for sharing note: a small amount of vanilla coffee creamer in your glass as you mix it is also tasty

wow! That is sooo good. I just made this for the first time today and my husband and I are both REALLY enjoying it.  I just may make another batch!  I ended up using hazelnut flavored decaf coffee.  It is just what i had.  But we are both impressed!.... 2nd time around, i added caramel! MMM.

Really great recipe. Due to dietary issues I made a few changes. Instead of cream I used soy milk, less sugar, and more vanilla (the idea being the vanilla would add sweetness without added calories) the result- deliciousness! Going to be making this again and again!

Thanks for this simple recipe! The taste of it seemed pretty average compared to most store bought iced coffees, so I'll enjoy tweaking this to my favor, as well as adding new flavors with different coffee's and creamers.
I do agree with others here, that the creamer can be substituted for other creamers and/or ice cream.

So easy and very versatile!  Don't want vanilla..just add chocolate and you have an iced mocha.  I topped mine with whipped cream and cinnamon.  Melting the sugar in the water is not necessary if the coffee is still hot.  What a delicious and easy way to use that leftover coffee!  Thanks for sharing.

My nephew and I are both coffee lovers. We tried this recipe for the first time with leftover coffee and love it. I'll never throw out the leftover coffee again!

This was an excellent recipe. The second time I made it, I skipped the boil water and dissolve sugar step entirely. I skipped the vanilla extract, added caramel syrup, and used Splenda and heavy cream for my liking. It was amazing!!!

This is really good.  I did regret putting the vanilla.  For some reason it made me not like it and I usually prefer vanilla whatevers.

An instant favorite! Thanks for the recipe, I have made this everyday since coming across this recipe, it keeps well in the fridge and I just mix up a cup before work. I think I finally found a way to beat that Starbucks addiction!

This was REALLY good! I did change it a bit tho because I didn't have any cream. I used the same amount of coffee, ice and vanilla but instead of cream and sugar I used sweetened condensed milk to taste- alittle more than 1/2 cup-that way I also didn't need extra water or cooling time. Just toss it together and go!

Coming from a non-coffee-drinker, this recipe was fabulous! I didn't have vanilla, so I used Coffee Mate's Vanilla and Caramel creamer.  To speed up the cooling process, I filled up a Ziplock bag with ice cubes and left it in the hot coffee. Will definately be making this again... and again... and again.

I'm a broke student who needs a cheap delicious coffee fix in large quantities for finals week and this was absolutely perfect! I made it just as the recipe stated, but then threw the cooled ingredients into my blender with ice, then added milk (I didn't have cream) and it's even better than a $5 frappachino. Blending it made a nice froth too, which I also loved. Delicious! Thank you for helping me survive finals week!!!!

my hubby is really sick of hot coffee and is always asking me to make some ice coffee...the recipe i used was so full of fat and calories and just could not bring myself to make that anymore....so he quit drinking coffee UNTIL i ran across this recipe...I'm so glad I found an ice coffee recipe that is not full of fat.  The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and I mix the sugar in with the coffee while hot and put in fridge and when cool add the cream.  I do not add the boiling water. THANK YOU SARAH!!!

Love this recipe! Been making it every summer for the past few years. I follow the recipe exactly then add vanilla flavored creamer when I pour a glass. I like mine nice and sweet.

We followed the recipe exactly and found it to be delicious. This will be a regular thing around our household. May tweak it a bit to lessen the calorie count going forward.

I liked this iced coffee for something different from my usual morning hot coffee. The ingredients are the same as my normal brew, except I used stevia instead of sugar. I also didn't do the sugar and boiling water but just added my stevia to my hot coffee before letting it cool.

I made this exactly as written, except I used half & half because that's more to my liking.  It was very delicious, not too sweet, perfect creamy texture.  I found I liked it better after it was completely chilled, so the ice didn't melt.  I've since tried it with substituting almond extract and coconut extract for the vanilla.  All have been yummy.

Easy and excellent, as is.  I'd failed at iced coffee before because I did not simply chill it before pouring it over ice.  The sugar syrup with vanilla was a nice touch.  I just made 1/4 of the recipe, to serve one.

Not bad, but here's another alternative. Save left over coffee and freeze it in ice cube trays, then your iced coffee won't get diluted. I didn't use sweetener or cream, used International Delight French vanilla for a touch of sweetness.

The only mod I do is change the vanila extract to caramel extract, and double it. Then i make as many servings and stick it in fridge with coffee in seperate container to use through the day!

I am just starting to get into coffee, so I don't like the hot stuff just yet but I love iced coffee! This recipe was pretty good, except it was quite sweet enough for my tastes. (I like it pretty sweet.) For a lower calorie drink, I did about 1/4-1/3 cup non-fat milk with about 2 teaspoons heavy cream. Very yummy, but I did have to add a couple more teaspoons of sugar, but that is just my preference. Overall, yummy and perfect for hot summer days!

So-so right after making, but after sitting in the fridge for a few hours, it tasted just like Starbucks Frapp drinks that come in those bottles. Anyway, very good!
