This is an awesome and easy recipe. At holidays with all the fuss and pressure, this is quick and looks as if you have spent hours creating it. I only changed the lettuce to baby spinach since it was easier to get at time. I also made it again using canned apples. Very good.

I did not like this recipe at all, I made it and threw it away.  I thought that there was hardly any flavor to it.  The only thing I can think of is that  maybe the pears weren't drained as well as they could've been and that that diluted the flavoring.  I **might** try it again and make sure that the pears are drained VERY well.

This is SO easy and my family begs me to make this recipe.  My 10 year old son volunteered me to make it for his class without telling me until the last minute.  The cool thing was that since it is so simple, I could easily supervise him as he pulled it together himself!

My family has been making cinnamon pears for Christmas Eve for decades.  My recommendations are to leave the pears in the cinnamon syrup for at least 2 days.  This will infuse them with even more cinnamon flavor.  We also use about a bag and a half of Red Hots and don't use red food coloring since the candies make the pears red enough on their own.  What can I say, we like our pears cinnamon-y!

My last recommendation is to serve the pears with a dollop of cream cheese resting on the pear.  The cream cheese really ties the room together, plus it's a nice counter to the cinnamon.

tried the recipe and it was great.  I did combine it with another recipe for pears that used cream cheese balls rolled in pecans and topped with mayo and marachino cherry juice and them topped with the cherry for garnish. Adds that little bit of lacking flavor. Also if you want more cinnamon flavor add cinnamon extract.

What a tasty, festive addition to our holiday menu...thanks! I have been requested to make these every Christmas. As easy as it was, that won't be too hard a request to fulfill.

OK, I haven't actually MADE this yet, but I'm on the hunt for this or a recipe like this that my dearly departed Grandmother made when I was a just wee thing.  I absolutely adored it!
As far as the review that claims it was flavorless, honestly - I would only make it with pears that are canned in heavy syrup - not juice.  I realize that it's definitely NOT the healthiest option, and that may not even be the issue, but I DO know it was flavorful and delicious in the late 70s/early 80s, when canned fruit was canned in syrup and not juice. I distinctly remember the spicy, sweet SYRUP being one of my favorite parts.  I also know they got better the longer they sat in the Red Hots.
And forget the lettuce... (sorry Erin)... but if you don't eat these with vanilla ice cream, and the warmed (or cool) cinnamon syrup melting into into the most delicious, spicy pools of flavor you could imagine, you are missing out.  They're great plain, but they're another level completely on vanilla ice cream.
Thank you Erin for making me tingly with nostalgia and bringing my "Mema" back to me.

My mother made these every holiday. She also filled the pear halves with softened cream cheese and topped with chopped walnuts. My children and grandchildren request them every holiday. It has now been a family favorite to remember Grandma Mary.

I think i might make this a new chrismas tradition. They were very good with that light hint of cinamon falvor. i served them on the lettuce, but did not eat the lettuce with it. The lettuce made the presentation, but that was about it for me. Will make again

These are great.  I added them to romaine lettuce & pecans and drizzled with balsamic dressing to make a tasty salad.  I also topped crackers with baked Brie cheese and these pears thinly sliced (my teenager freaked out over that one!).

Our cousin makes this and all she does is let the pears and red hots sit together overnight.  But this recipe insures that the candies melt!  Hope my daughter takes this to her first t-giving with her boyfriend.   Everyone will be impressed.

They were very pretty, but lacking something in flavor.  It was a nice finish to a heavy dinner though.  Thank you.

These looked better than they tasted.They tasted okay though.  I had to sub fresh pears since the store was oSoooo, I cored, peeled&poached five (3#).What I did: Boiled 2c water,added 1/2c sugar, stirred to dissolve; added 3.75oz bottle cinnamon decorator candies, no food coloring.There was about a teaspoon that didn't dissolve, gummy/sticky that I just took out. Added 2c more water, returned to a boil.Added the pears.Brought to a gentle boil&reduced.  Placed a ring of waxed paper over to help evenly cook.Every so often,I'd move the pears around.  In 30 minutes,they tested done.Cooled them in the pot to room temp then refrigerated for two days.I cut them in to slices,12 per pear,& arranged them on a white dish to look like poinsettia petals,all the same way curved.The inside didn't get as pink as the outside,but that made it even prettier,the variation.Combined small,8oz?,tub storebrand cool whip,8oz cream cheese (whipped till fluffy)&1/4-1/2csugar.Placed a little of that in the middle of the dish right before serving.The remaining I added a little cherry juice&served it with Black Forest Cake.Sum up: Some people didn't try because they didn't know what they were.Some didn't try because they knew it was pears. Pretty, but not too impressive by the flavor.Definately easy though - & anything that can be made ahead is always good.If I make again,I'd add more candies-& maybe buy canned pears. :)

I did not make it but was fortunate to have these pears made by a friend for a Christmas gathering.  They are very tasty and refreshing, and look attractive on the serving platter.

PERFECT!  I was looking for a dessert that would be "light" and this was PERFECT even though it wasn't Christmas.  I loved the way the cinnamon flavored the pears.  I didn't have pear halves but I did have sliced pears, so I used them.   Hubby and I both agree this would be great using apples as well.  Thank you Erin for sharing your recipe!

Wonderful.  Even better several days later  I used Brach's Cinnamon Imperials because I couldn't find official "Red Hots".  This will be on the Christmas breakfast menu.

I have been making these pears for my family for years for Valentines Day.  They love them and look forward each year.  I suggest that you take two pear halves and stuff with your favorite white cream filling. I use cream cheese mixed with cool whip and slivered almonds. When put together the pear halves become a beautiful, tasty treat served on lettuce on a Dollie. Love it!

This was a lovely beginning to our Christmas dinner.
