I like how light and healthy this salad is.  For me it didn't have enough flavor so I added a lot more cilantro, lime juice and tossed in peanuts.  I will make this again as a light lunch with my additions and some grilled chicken. This is a very big salad, more than 8 servings.  Thank you for sharing.

I loved this recipe. I omitted the radish and only had one green apple so I used two pears.  Added more lime juice.  Rather than grate the ingredients, I just chopped them and it worked out just fine.  Definitely a way to clean out the fridge and make a great salad at the same time!

We enjoyed this refreshing slaw. It's best with plenty of salt and pepper. I also doubled the dressing. I think raisins or dried cranberries would add a lot, because the texture is a little monotonous. I'm not sure I'd make this again unless I had ingredients I needed to use up, but all in all not a bad little salad!

Everyone I've made this for has really liked it. I'm surprised to see people call it "bland" because when I've made it, it has been anything but. I don't know if it's a difference in ingredient or what. I always use herbs fresh out of my garden and local produce. We do tend to eat this on fish tacos or pulled pork sandwiches rather than by itself, so that could be part of the issue. I have experimented with this quite a bit and have found that the addition of more herbs, red wine vinegar, finely shredded sweet walla walla onion, lemon olive oil, an orange (with the juice) and a bit of sugar improve the flavor. I tend to make stuff from whatever I have on hand and this recipe was the result of needing to clean out my veggie drawer. I'm sure you can sub in just about any vegetable (broccoli slaw would be great here, as would pineapple or mango.. and chili peppers to give it a spicy kick) and I recommend upping the amount of cilantro. There should be a balance between acidic, sweet, sour, salty and spicy. Hope this helps!

Refreshing, nutritious crunchy salad that compliments any meal.  The orange and lime marinade top it off.  I used lemon and the results were outstanding.  Highly recommended.  Everyone raved.

I also thought this was just ok.  I'm not sure it was quite worth the effort - a little bland.  I think it is missing something, maybe chopped red onion would liven it up a little?

This salad on it's own is ok, but i put it on a spice crusted fish sandwich and it was really good.  the recipe made WAY to much for my husband and I so we're going to try freezing some to use on future fish sandwiches.  To make the fish sandwich I used cod fillets (tilapia works well too)  covered it in flour, then dipped in egg and then dipped in panko with seasoning and then cooked in a pan w oil.  I used focacia for the bread.

This had to be the most GOSH AWFUL salad I've ever locked my lips around !!!    I was SOOOOO looking forward to a salad with jicama and different herbs.   Even with the suggestions, I had to spit it out and toss it away -- and I've been known to eat some crappy tasting stuff.   This ranks worse than octopus soup or menudo.  BLECH !!

I thought this recipe was OK, others in my family were more like, "I'll eat it."  Mostly it seemed like more trouble than it was worth, what with all that grating...It is better the second day than the first.  It didn't have a bad flavor, but just didn't do much for me or my family.

Great slaw! Didn't have Jicama or cabbage so I shredded some cucumber and celery. Also... I cheated and added mayo.... Delicious!

loved this!  didn't have jicama or daikon.  used regular radishes.  added some finely chopped green onions too.  i used my mandolin and finely cut everything.  i think the cilantro and lime make the dish.  i will make again.  thanks for the post serena.

Made as written but omitted cabbage.  Was very good the first day but the pears did not hold up the next day.  May omit the pears next time.

Tasty.  Easy to make.  I would julienne the ingredients rather than "shred" next time, or use the food processor.  With leftovers I added some pineapple, which was also yummy.

I'm always looking for more slaw recipes, but this one isn't one I will make again.  It was pretty much flavorless as the recipe is written.  I added more oil, lime and cilantro to the 8 cups of veg/fruit mixture but that still didn't get it to great.  I added some sugar, and more salt than I usually use to get more taste, but it needs something else to make it more flavorful and interesting...
