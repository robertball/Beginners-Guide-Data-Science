This was a great recipe but I did make a few changes I used regular flour and sugar and I lowered the amount of sea salt and I used white chocolate chips . but I think next time I may leave them out they just sunk to the bottom and didn't melt and we're stuck to the bottom.  I found the batter to be too loose so I added 1/4 cup more of flour , and I'll use a milder coffee next time the bustelo  was a bit over powering.  alsoI baked them for 18 min in a 375 oven maybe it's just my oven but they came out great light and fluffy , though the bottom was a little crunchy because of the chips , but overall  they were great I had to keep slapping my husband hand because he was eating them before I could frost them lol.  I also tweaked the frosting  this is where I folded in the bacon and sprinkled sum on top .  and I used 1 teaspoon of maple extract  and two teaspoons of maple syrup and two splashes of vanilla extract because extracts tend to make  things taste artificial in my opinion , it takes away from the homemade taste.  I was worried at first cause the batter had a molasses taste , but when I tasted the finished cupcake it was almost like a coffee cupcake but the finished product was the perfect balanced bite, I could taste every ingredient  I will definitely be making these again , I think I may have to because my husband might divorce me lol

I am excited to try this recipe!  I love the warning, however, I am not looking for a healthy recipe, I have been searching all evening for a tasty bacon cupcake recipe and came across your comment about a different bacon cupcake recipe and I am making yours instead! It appears to be much more flavorful, daring and exciting.  Thank you so much for sharing!  I am giving 5 Stars, because I know myself, my friends and family will love them.  If you do not see a retraction post, then you know I am busy baking and sharing your recipe with my friends and fam. :)

Was not sure I would like this recipe but made them for my husband's birthday as he is a bacon lover.  The bacon is not overpowering and the maple cream cheese frosting is the perfect compliment to the cupcake.  Whole family liked them and the bacon birthday boy loved them!

I loved these cupcakes. I love sugar and coffee and bacon and it was just so deliciously unhealthy for me! It's a wonderful treat for myself! The only thing that stops me from giving it a five star rating is the bacon bits in the cupcake. I don't know if it's normal to have bacon inside the cake part of bacon cupcakes, but I just found it a little strange and next time would just leave the bacon as garnish. This is just personal opinion though. If you like having bits of bacon inside your cake, than this recipe is perfect for you!

These were good but super greasy. I don't think the bacon grease should be used. If I do make them again I'm going to leave out the grease and just use butter and up the bacon. I couldn't taste it unless I got a piece in my cupcake. They're really sweet and moist though :) Oh and the icing left a lot to be desired. Just not my cup of tea really. The cream cheese was all I could taste by the end of the bite. Thanks for sharing!
