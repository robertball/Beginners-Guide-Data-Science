Nice and simple, not too sweet. Makes for a pretty color in the martini glass, too.

Successful 1st try, which is saying a lot for this "bartender."  We found this drink to be tasty and reminiscent of Hawaiian Punch with vodka or even of a light fruit cocktail syrup with vodka. Sounds a little weird, but is actually among the "comfort food" of drinks.  It wasn't too sweet, and it was a very pretty color.  We will definitely make it again.

Tried this cocktail out a couple of weeks ago on a group camping trip, it was a big hit.  We made up a big batch of them and served them from a 2 gallon jug.  The fact that they are so easy to put together makes the great for camping.  This one is a keeper, thanks for sharing it with us.

Yummy and super simple to make being that it's equal parts of everything.  I made a big batch of it at the beginning of my party so it as easy to just pour the mixture in the shaker and make several drinks.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so much more cherry tasting than I thought it would be! It's in the fruity side so it's great for people like my sister who don't like harsh drinks. I just added another shot of vodka to mine. :)

Really refreshing and light drink for a hot summer evening. We did add 1/2 oz of marischino cherry juice to add a little more cherry flavor.
