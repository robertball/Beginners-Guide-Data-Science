If you are overrun with zucchini as I am, have I found a recipe for you.  This is one of the best zucchini recipes I have found in a long time.  It's delicious.  I didn't saute the zucchini very long  because I don't like mushy zucchini.  It came out perfect.   Thanks for sharing!

Was the hit of our church potluck. I don't know if it was needed but I gradually added the hot squash/onion mixture to the eggs to temper the eggs prior to mixing all together.  It was savory and custardy and just wonderful.
