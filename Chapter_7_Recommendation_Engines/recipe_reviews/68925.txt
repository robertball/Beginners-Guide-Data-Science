Very flavorful rendition for a salmon bake. Only alteration I would recommend would be to replacing cheddar with an italian or white cheese of some type. It will suit the salmon and onion flavors much better. . . It is also good when placing a row of asparagus spears lining underneath the fish when baked. It soaks in the juices and spices and providing a complimentary side vegetable. . .

I thought that using Cheddar sounded sort of gross on salmon, so I chose to not use the Cheddar or the onion and instead I substituted in Chèvre cheese (soft goat cheese) and mixed it with chopped walnuts, dill and 1 tsp. garlic.  When you place the salmon back into the oven the cheese and nuts will brown slightly, but not melt.  I think that the Chèvre and walnuts complements the flavor of the fish much better than the cheddar.  I used a 1:1 ratio of walnuts and Chèvre.  I have made this recipe many times and it is my husband's and my absolute favorite, plus the walnuts add even more healthy omega-3 !!

Very flavorful, and a new way to bake Salmon, for me. I edited the recipe a little based on personal taste and others reviews. I changed the cheddar cheese to a baby swiss, added 4 finely chopped garlic cloves, less dill, and lightly drizzled olive oil beneath the cheese to keep the Salmon moist. The flavor was very complimentary! We laid asparagus spears on the bottom of the foil, and they were cooked to perfection!

Mmmmmm, good!  My husband is not a fan of salmon, but he liked this and would like it more often, so that's saying a lot!  Kids liked it, too!  I did a few things different, but not much.  I didn't have green onions on hand and I used Mexican shredded cheese on top (we always have that in the house, so it's what I use).  Served with steamed califlower and diced baked red potatoes.  Yummy, can't wait to have it again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I couldn't find a 'baked' salmon recipe anywhere and to think to put cheese on it also was delicious! I used paprika instead of dill weed because I didn't have any but it was still a wonderful and easy dish! Thanks

I also baked it on top of asparagus.  I sprinkled mine with some dry parmesan spread mix and a couple pats of butter.  I then eliminated the cheese on top.  Superb!

I just recently started experimenting with salmon recipes, and it probably will not become one of my favorite foods... but.. this recipe is a very good one! It was really very nice, and I do recommend adding extra cheese. For those of you who love salmon, you'll love this recipe. I liked it, even tho salamon isn't my dish.

I usually grill or broil the salmon and really wanted to try something different. I must say, this was delicious, and I would certainly make it again for our guests. The combination of the cheddar cheese with the green onions was not as overpowering as I thought it would be.  And baking the fish in foil made it tender and flaky. Very different than what I am accustomed to when it's grilled.  It melted in my mouth and was just what I was looking for.

I made this just like the recipe.  The cheese and salmon seemed to cancel each other out.  It didn't taste bad, just kind of bland.

WOW! delicious! I was concerned about cooking that long at that temp. But it worked out just great. Our quantity of salmon was a little less than the recipe calls for. Otherwise the only adjustments we made was to use more garlic (3 cloves instead of 2) and more green onions & more cheese (the latter because others had recommended). Salmon flavor still came through in just the right balance of flavors.

This is delicious! I went by the recipe exactly and I made mashed red skinned potatoes with steamed aspargus. I added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch and cream cheese to the potatoes. A major hit with my family. They wanted me to make it again the very next day, no left overs!

Excellent!  I get tired of the sweet salmon marinades and glazes so this is a great change.  Everyone I've made it for, and I've been making it for a couple of years now, loves it.  Easy too!

This is really good.  Made a few changes hence only 4 stars.  Subbed parmesan for the cheddar.  That just sounded a bit odd for even me.  :)  Also added fresh basil and fresh parsley.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

A huge dinner party meant a larger piece of fish, and slight adjustment to the quantities of the ingredients.  This was a big hit with everyone. Definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

Made it without the green onion the first time, and it was better that way. Also, used minced garlic, which intensified the garlic flavor (we like garlic).

Overall a keeper.

This was a great salmon dish for me to prepare in a hurry. It tasted amazing and the spring onions gave it a lovely fresh taste. This was yummy served alongside roast pumpkin and potatoes.

Followed the recipe almost exactly, just used fresh dill, added a 1Tbsp butter, and placed asparagus on the bottom of the foil. Delicious!

I really liked this recipe but my husband said it was a bit to fishy for him. I used white sharp cheddar and red onions because that is all I had on hand. I thought it was just slightly over done but they were small fillets, so I should have know. I would make this for myself again, but I don't think my husband will want it again.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I love the combination of flavors, they didn't overpower the salmon.  And the cheese is just the right amount, it's enough to give flavor, but not too heavy to cancel out the healthiness of the salmon.  We really enjoyed this dish and recommend it!

I gave this only 3 stars because I liked everything about this dish except the cheese, which is supposed to be the star. That is what makes this recipe different from others. But we just didn't like the cheese on the salmon. In our opinion is better without.

This was just ok. It was really bland and boring. Salmon is way too expensive and tasty to ruin it with a boring recipe. There are way too many great salmon recipes out there. This one just doesn't hold a candle to most of them.

We eat a lot of salmon in Alaska. Most recipes cover up the taste of the fish.  This one enhances it and is really very good.

I loved the ease of preparation but I won't be making this one again.  I think topping a rich oily fish with rich cheddar cheese is just overkill - and I'm not fat-phobic!    Twenty-five minutes total in a 450 degree oven is just too much.  Following this recipe to the letter, the salmon was overcooked and I just didn't find the flavor very inspiring.  Sorry!

I love this recipe. It is SO easy and very moist! The only thing I would change is to omit the dill - I used bottled, I think it would be much better with fresh if you like Dill.

My boyfriend LOVED this recipe! I was surprised at how much he liked it. I felt it was a bit heavy on the onions though so I did cut back on them when I made it again. Dill is now one of my favorite herbs to cook with.

This was excellent. It was enough to be tasted over the salmon, but not enough that you lost the salmon taste. Mmm!

Enjoyed this very much.  I usually make same 2 boring recipes so decided to look for something new.  Hubby loved it. I did add a blend of mozzarella and cheddar. Perfect blend for this recipe and it comes shredded in a bag!  Thought cheddar would be too much for the  fish.

The flavor was ok but didn't complement the salmon. The cheese toned down the flavor of the salmon. I would use this recipe if I had salmon that wasn't that fresh (although still edible of course) as a flavor changer. Good for those who aren't big salmon fans too.

My wife and I loved this dish but we followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions by not using cheddar cheese and onions.  Instead I made a mixture of Mediterranean spiced soft goat cheese, dill, chopped walnuts, 1 clove diced garlic and a tsp of EVOO.  I put the mixture on top in the last five minutes just like the recipe stated and it was delicious. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion of putting the fish on a bed of veggies, great idea but I wouldn't use asparagus again, they came out way overcooked.  Green beans under the fish came out perfectly. We are absolutely making this dish again!

Just tried this recipe, and added my own minor twists to it. Easy and delicious. I added Garlic Pepper, Onion Powder, and Mrs. Dash to my spice mixture, and actually left off the onions. Nice combination that I will add to my repertoire.

I followed the directions when making this dish.  It came out over-cooked and dry.  If you are using small fillets, you might want to lower the temp. to 350 instead of 450.  I will retry this recipe at a later time.

I, personally do not care for most fish, especially salmon due to it's strong flavor. This was prepared for a large gathering last night and was a HIT among all (even those picky kidos). I stayed with the recipe only adding coconut milk on top while baking for creaminess. Highly Recommend.

Tried this last night and was very pleased. I did make a few changes - we didn't have fresh garlic in the house, so had to use garlic powder along with the dried dill.  Also added a couple dots of butter on top of the fish.  Also replaced cheddar with grated parmesan with only a sprinkling of cheddar.  All on a bed of asparagus.  I would not have thought to have melted cheese on salmon - but it was great.  The asparagus really worked well with the fish as well.  Thanks for the "keeper", Megan.

I really like the salmon with the cheese (I used a pizza blend instead of straight cheddar). The texture and taste of the two blended well, though I did wish I had found a way to make the fish more flavorful, the salmon was slightly overwhelmed by the cheese. Add some spice and this is a keeper.

This is one of my favorite ways I have prepared salmon recently.  Like others, I included asparagus in my foil pack.  The asparagus came out perfectly.  I did not have dill and I used sharp white cheddar.  I served the fish with salad and baked sweet potatoes.  I will definitely make this again.

This was an excellent recipe!  I LOVE the easy cleanup (since it bakes on foil) and didn't have any green onions so I used fresh chives and a bit of chopped onion... it was WONDERFUL!
Thanks!!

Great recipe, fast and easy to make. I find using garlic salt in place of garlic cloves and salt works well for thoes who don't want to fuss with garlic cloves.

I made this tonight for my dad and myself. I discovered we didn't have any dill so I used rosemary instead. I also used Romano cheese instead, really tasty! My dad loved it too.

I used about three times the garlic suggested and manchego cheese from Spain instead of cheddar and it turned out wonderful. I also baked it with asparagus beneath the salmon. MMMMMM!

Finally a salmon recipe to love! Adding the cheese on top was such a greatr idea. I tweaked the recipe by placing halfed garlic cloves on top of the fish and added a drizzle of olive oil because I was afraid it would be dry.     

I am a fan of salmon- but not a fan of baked fish. Both the husband and I loved this dish. Will definately use again.

Tried b/c everyone but me doesn't like salmon so hoped the cheese would redeem it. No dice... but I liked it. Wasn't the most awesome dish, but can't get much easier. Didn't have the onions on hand so maybe that would have made a difference. Beware this is a higher temp and shorter time than some fish recipes so don't over cook!! In my opioion, under done is much easier to deal with than a dry salmon!!

I made this on the request of boyfriend who doesn't like salmon at all... and didn't really like this either. I love salmon, and thought the cheddar cheese completely ruined the dish. Maybe this would be a way to trick non-salmon likers to eat it, or maybe not.

Apart from using fresh dill - I can never really taste the dried stuff - I made this as written, and it was good! The cheese compliments the salmon surprisingly well. Thanks!

I probably didn't season this as much as it needed, but it was very moist and cheesy.

A nice topping for the salmon. Cheddar cheese brought out a bit more oil from the fish so I might try a different cheese next time but it was still yum.
