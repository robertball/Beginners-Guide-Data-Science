I used 1 chicken breast that I seasoned with garlic, pepper and onion powder. canned mushrooms, (that's all I had),  4oz cream cheese (only had an 8 oz block and it was easier to just cut in half), and an 8 oz can of crescent rolls.  I prepared the "pockets" in several different ways, but found the easiest was to use 2 crescent rolls together flattened slightly into a rectangle,  add the mixture  along the edge of one of the longer sides, roll up and make sure seams and ends are sealed and bake for  20 minutes.  My husband loved it, but I thought it was missing a little something (might add a dash of hot sauce next time).  Thanks for the recipe, will be making it again.

I made this recipe the other night for my family! It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it! I used leftover rotisserie chicken for it and it was delicious! I doubled the recipe because I had so much chicken and it worked perfectly. I also used two crescent rolls sealed together in a rectangle shape. Made pockets about the size of an orange. Because I doubled the recipe, I ended up using 3 tubes of crescent rolls. I think it made about 12 of them. It was great, but I think next time I might make some cream of mushroom soup or something to put over the top. Just the slightest bit dry...

I've made this more than once.  The flavor is delicious and they are great to take in a lunch.  I've had them as leftovers and they're just fine.

After some trial and error I have found that I like to make these with two packages of crescent rolls.  I don't separate each piece of roll but rather use two pieces to make each portion.  I keep them together in a rectangular shape.

I have made this several times with the only change being to brush the tops and bottoms of each pocket with melted butter and coating them with Italian bread crumbs. They look like I fussed all day and my guests love them!

4 stars since I did my own version, but a great idea!  Sauteed the holy trinity (chopped onion, celery, carrots) in the butter, some Lawry's low sodium seasoning and some dried thyme leaves. Added fresh chopped mushrooms after 5 or so minutes and gave it another 2 or 3 minutes.  Poured in some dry sherry (NEVER cooking sherry! It's full of sodium), and 1/2 can of cream of chicken soup.  Had purchased a rotisserie chicken and used the breast meat coarsely chopped (saving the rest for another dish).  Added that to the above to heat.  Used crescent sheets, one on bottom, one on top, to make a large Wellington.  Piled the chicken mixture in the center and sealed the sides.  Brushed top with melted butter and baked for about 30 minutes, until top was nice and brown.  YUM!!!

These were great! The only changes I made were to double the filling and roll it up in 2 8oz cans of garlic-butter flavored crescents, using the turn-two-triangles-into-a-rectangle method as suggested by other reviewers. My fiance raced back to the kitchen for seconds!

These things are awesome! I love them cooked exactly as the recipe states and I have made alterations. To save time I have used precook end, sliced chicken and it was great. I do prefer to precook my onions just a little.

I thought this was a good recipe but I also added a few things along the way. I put in WAY more onion than it said to but we like onion. I also added some Italian seasoning, garlic, and lemon juice.
This recipe is very hands on and takes quite a bit of time but the result is delicious and worth it.

Husband really liked it. I modified it to include green peppers and onions since I had them on hand. I combined milk and cream of chicken soup so the top wouldn't dry out. I served over white rice.

This is good, and I really liked it.  But, it is missing something.  The center wasn't quite creamy enough, and could use more flavor.

Turned out good.  The chicken breasts I used were huge and I made the packets small and ended up using two tubes of rolls. While it turned out good, I guess I wouldn’t say it was spectacular.  Sort of bland.  I think it needs a bit more seasoning.

Doesn't work well and it  sure doesn't feed 3 people with the expanded ingredient list. Didn't like it at all. My first bad rating on All Recipes website.

I liked this recipe, but felt it was missing something.  The second time instead of using cream cheese I used a garlic cheese (rondele) and it matched our taste buds.  I also used two rolls together as others have suggested.

I used thighs as we like them better and I seasoned them and cooked them in broth then I used the drippings for gravy. As other reviewers suggested I made the crescent rolls into rectangles before stuffing them. If you were making appetizer sizes I would probably split the crescent rolls in half (smaller triangles). The existing crescent roll size is a awkward shape for the right amount of stuffing per bread. Maybe for the holidays I will make these as appetizers, and update the review.

Everyone thinks they are marvelous and "suitably fancy for company"

Added peas and shredded cheese to the cream cheese and rotisserie chicken mix. Made rectangle pockets out of the crescent rolls. Great recipe for kids and quick meals.

Love this!  I was looking for a tasty, chicken dish that we could make quickly and this was it!  My 10 year old daughter helped make them, and the entire family loved them!  I didn't have green onions on hand, so we sautéed yellow onion with the mushrooms instead.  Delicious!
