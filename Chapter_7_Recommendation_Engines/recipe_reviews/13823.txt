Excellent. This turned out so good. I made it the night before and let it marinate overnight, cutting up the cucumbers and adding them about 20 minutes before. It's so tangy and the dressing would be AWESOME served on a salad. I had 3 people ask me for the recipe for this today when I served it at my sons birthday party. I used orange and yellow peppers instead of green because I love the flavor of them so much more.

Made this for a holiday party.  It was good but not as great as I expected. I let it set for 8 hours, but I would recommend letting it set for longer. It didn't have as much of a 'kick' as I thought, so next time I will add more cayenne.

Today is the third time I have made this salad.  Friends and family really like the light, refreshing quality - especially when the weather is hot.  I had a few unexpected guests for dinner today, so to stretch the salad I added some  fusilli pasta that I broke into small pieces before cooking.  Not a morsel remained!

DELICIOUS!  Light, refreshing and crisp.  We like hot so we used a full teaspoon of the Cayene pepper.  It was just right for us.   Be advised though - the heat from the Cayenne tends to take a bit of time to really flavor the salad.  If you are not sure how much heat you like, add the recommended amount, let it sit for 20 minutes and taste.   We used 1 tablespoon of sugar and it was just right.  Will be making this often.  Next version will be to add some pasta!  Great recipe!

Nice salad, I made it with vary little Cayenne since one of our guests doesn't like spicy food and then after I served that person I sprinkled chili powder... it was very good

I really liked this recipe and so did my eight year old. I put the cucumbers in with everything else and let it sit a day. If making the recipe my way -take the seeds out of the cucumbers or it will water down your sauce.

I made this almost 5 years ago to be had with Christmas dinner, so my memory of it is a little fuzzy. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is, admittedly, my fault. I think this recipe would be a perfect summertime one, and in the winter when you're relying on hothouses for your tomatoes and cucumbers and peppers, it loses a little something. It's still really tasty. I can't believe I haven't made it again, as I've intended to all along. Definitely will, next season.

Tomatoes can proved to be very expensive in the off season (December). While the taste of this salad was very nice, it did not have the sort of textures I wanted... in particular the dressing.

I thought I'd like this more than I did.  I might make again.  If I do, I'll use less celery salt.  Love the idea.  I'll play with it sometime.  The celery flavor was just a bit too much, just a bit.

This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box since May 2011.  Glad I finally got around to making it.  I loved it, my husband liked it.  Because we like spicy foods, I upped the cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon.  We both loved the dressing of this dish and agreed it would make a nice salad dressing.  My husband thought he would enjoy the salad more without the tomatoes, so he picked out all the other stuff and gave me his tomatoes.  I thought the entire salad had a really nice flavor.  Served this with 'Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs' from AR, grilled Parmesan green beans, grilled garlic bread and 'Chocolate Stuffed Raspberries' a personal recipe from AR.

I made this yesterday and I’m sorry to have been so disappointed. I don’t know if it is too much celery salt or mustard seed or what, but this just tasted like an extremely strong pickle juice over the veggies.

Great refreshing salad. LOVE it. It’s very light. I added fresh cilantro, used English cucumber so I did have to peel the skin. I also didn’t have celery salt so I used garlic salt instead. TIP: peeling the tomatoes seems like extra work, but totally worth it coz they soak up the dressing and taste awesome and I’m not  even a fan of tomatoes.

Big hit at a summer picnic! Doubled the recipe but accidentally forgot to double the spices, which was probably a good thing for all the kids around at the picnic. Still, the salad was a big hit with a few people asking me for the recipe. Made the salad the night before and let it marinade in the dressing in the fridge. Chopped up the cucumber the morning of and took in a separate container. Mixed everything up right before serving. Will definitely be making this again.

I used red instead of green peppers and It turned out great. I loved how all of the flavors came together and it made the taste very unique.
