Added some freshly-chopped carrots to give this a little color, otherwise, followed the recipe instructions.  Yes, it certainly was easy to put together.  I've never been crazy about canned tuna, but my husband likes it, and we both enjoyed this meal.  Served over puff pastry shells.

Just like how my mom used to make. I didn't change anything except for adding some chopped mushrooms and diced carrot. Easy recipe to throw together if your on a budget.

I followed all the instructions except replace the onion with garlic and onion powder, I added mixed vegetables instead of peas, and I added some old bay to bring out the fish flavor. My hubby loved it and he doesn't like fish! I will definitely make this again!

My family loved this recipe! I served it over noodles. It was perfect because I could easily have everything on hand and everyone enjoyed it.
