Awesome! Added a half cup shredded coconut and subbed coconut oil for canola oil and vanilla for maple extract.  This is a definite keeper!  Oh I don't like cinnamon in my granola so I left it out. Thanks!

I thought this was good granola. The cook times were exact too. I lined a large baking sheet with foil and turned it after 20 minutes and then again after 15 minutes. I baked it on the bottom rack farthest away from the heat source. It makes quite a bit, but I know it will get eaten as cereal or on yogurt or ice cream. I assumed ground flax seed was flax meal and used that. It makes it a little messy if eating it by hand though. Only other downside, of the recipe, is maple syrup is so expensive and this takes 2/3 a cup of it. However, the maple flavor does come through and it smells very good while baking.

For lower calorie count use 1/4 cup of coconut oil instead of 1/3 canola.  I used 1/2 tsp salt and sprinkled more on top.  Omitted flavoring, seeds, and cinnamon, added vanilla.  Perfect.  At least half the price of store bought, and soooo much better.  What's with those tiny bags of $4.00 stale store bought granola anyway?

My new favorite smell?  Baking this delicious granola!!
The only alterations I made were coconut oil instead of canola, for an extra healthy boost & added extra pecans in place of walnuts.  Perfect!  I am never buying store granola again!

I fell in love with maple granola on a trip to New England but haven't been able to find it in the Northwest so I was really happy to find this recipe. I used pure maple syrup as called for but did substitute coconut oil for the canola oil. Other than that I made as written, including maple flavoring and cinnamon, but since I didn't have pecans I subbed sliced almonds and added flaked coconut and raisins because I like both in my granola. I don't believe these things substantially changes the wonderful maple flavor of this granola. Now the big question - should I keep this to myself or share with DH. LOL

Awesome!
I followed the recipe, and added a few things on my own. I took  2 tbl. spoon of peanut butter and microwaved it with 1 tbl. spoon of coconut oil until melted and added it to the original oil mixture. Instead of using pure maple syrup I substituted 1/2 real and half artificial (cheeper!) . And I also added vanilla as well :D 
After baking it, I added honey to clump it up, and it turned out amazing!

There’s nothing like homemade granola! I tweaked the recipe a bit. Instead of pecans I used almonds. Instead of maple flavoring I used vanilla. I also added a mixture of sweetened and unsweetened coconut - about 1/2 cup and an extra 1/4 cup maple syrup to balance the extra dry ingredients. Lastly, to add extra crunch, I added 10 minutes to the baking time at 300 degrees, then another 10 minutes at 400 degrees. Be sure to check often so it doesn’t burn. Enjoy!

Just to add some sweetness to it. The last 5-8 minutes of cooking time, I pull it out and drizzle honey over it. Then when it cool it actually stays in little bite size clumps. I can get all my kids to eat it and it is now a favorite for car rides.

I skipped the flax seed and used 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla in place of the maple flavoring.  I used sugar free syrup.  Turned out well.

Great recipe. I added a little brown sugar and honey for some of the maple syrup. Also subbed olive oil for half of the canola oil. Stirred halfway thru cooking. Added dried fruit and a few more tablespoons of honey for the last 10 minutes of baking. Came out great! May use a little less sugar next time though.

I made the recipe exactly as it's written. This is an awesome recipe. Not too sweet, but sweet enough. All the flavors mesh well together. My three year old loves her "crunchies" and this is a lot cheaper and tastes better than  what you get at the grocery store. Just be aware, this makes quite a lot, so make sure you have a container big enough, or plan to freeze some.

Great maple flavor but not overly sweet. If you like granola clumped in big clusters, look elsewhere. I like adding a half cup of wheat germ, but consider baking at a lower temperature and keeping an eye on it, since those little bits burn easily. I regularly leave out the maple flavoring and cinnamon, sometimes adding a teaspoon of ginger (powder), instead.

I make this on a regular basis to replace store bought granola. I tried a couple others before finding this one and it is our favorite. I make it almost exactly as listed except I use vanilla instead of maple flavoring.

YUM!! So delicious! I changed a few things -- substituted coconut oil for canola, added some extra nuts and seeds, vanilla for maple flavoring, and I added one big spoonful of chunky peanut butter. I also added some dried fruits towards the end of baking. Overall so delicious and easy!

It was good. My only suggestion would be to add the salt in with the dry ingredients. And also I didn't add the maple extract because I didn't think it would be necessary and it wasn't.

First time it was a little chewy, it needs more time to dry out. After 40 min., turn the oven off and leave it in the oven overnight. I omitted the walnuts and used vanilla instead of maple flavoring. The first time I made this I added sweetened coconut and I would add it again. 
Halving this recipe is fine, used 1 cookie sheet instead of two. Used non-stick foil to line the sheet.

My favorite aspect of this is that it is not super sweet. I only used pecans and subbed a flax seed/hemp/chia mix for the ground flax. I used vanilla instead of maple extract. I like the ratio of the nuts to the oats and the cook time/temp is pretty perfect. I kept mine in for an extra 10min bc there wasn't any color change that I could see after 40min. Mine clumped pretty well, so I will follow the recipe again when I make it a second time!

Really good! Crunchy granola with the right amount of sweetness- maybe a little too much :) I did walnuts and coconut shreds as add-ins- no flax- coconut oil-subbed some brown sugar for maple syrup. I baked it a little longer so it was crispy. It stuck together well.  Could use a little more cinnamon. SMELLED AMAZING!!!!

Excellent nice and crunchy and not too sweet even with all that maple syrup,  I did not use walnuts the people are allergic to them I just used a full cup of pecans and it is great.  I do not have Maple extract so I used vanilla.   Will make again but will add some dried fruit raisins or cranberries.

I have bought the Trader Joe's Maple Pecan Granola for years and now they don't have it anymore. So I searched for a recipe I could grow to love as much. FOUND IT!
 I doubled the pecans, left out the walnuts and flax seed, used coconut oil and vanilla as some had suggested. Can't wait for breakfast in the morning.

Spectacular!  Like others, I skipped the cinnamon, added coconut, & used a mix of flax & wheat germ. I used a mix of coconut oil & sunflower seed butter in place of the oil.   Baking time was spot on. This recipe makes a generous amount & was a snap to make!  I'll definitely do this again!

Substituted cocoanut oil and vanilla, and used almonds because I did not have pecans on hand.  Tastes great - and so easy to make.  Will be making this again!

Love this recipe!!! Make a batch every week and the only changes I make is adding a couple tablespoons brown sugar, 1/2 cup slivered almonds, and vanilla extract instead of maple. Have it with milk every morning for breakfast.
