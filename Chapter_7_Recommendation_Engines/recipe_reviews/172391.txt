Quick way to prepare zucchini. I was unable to find Thai chilis so I used jalapenos and soem red pepper flakes. The black bean sauce was really good in this, but the extra water was a bit much. The zucchini sheds it's own water when cooking so I don't think this much water, if any at all is needed.. It diluted the yummy black bean taste, so I added a bit more at the end. I topped with a few sesame seeds for some exgtra sesame taste and texture

I over-cooked a zucchini a tad, but still good!  I added a little sesame chicken and it was great!
