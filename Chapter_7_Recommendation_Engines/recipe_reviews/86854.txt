I'm English. I'm a bloke. I live in the US. I do the cooking in our house. :-) This recipe is authentic . . . . . PROBLEMS: It crumbles? Too many oats? . . . . . . SOLUTIONS: ONE: In step 2 you must combine on very low heat and leave gently heating for at least 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Waiting for just the butter to melt is NOT long enough. The reason is that the brown sugar needs to liquefy. TWO: As good as they smell you must allow them to cool UNTIL COLD ..... Follow both these directions with the above recipe and you'll be fine. ..... My personal changes: When I add chopped dates I remove the same size amount from the oats. For example if I add 1/4 cup of dates, I remove 1/4 cup of oats. I also make them in a muffin tin for individual lunch box portions (as my photo shows). Enjoy.

5 stars with a few revisions... Try this for the perfect flapjack:  1 c. butter 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 c. golden syrup 2 1/3 c. quick cook oats (not instant)  Follow rest of the recipe as stated, though I usually only need to cook mine for 20 minutes at 350.  I also omitted the raisins for a more authentic flapjack.  Enjoy!!

I have been craving these for so long!
  
-I used porage oats instead of rolled oats. (If you can't find porage/Scottish oats, just toss some rolled oats in the blender and pulse a couple times until the oats approach the size of instant potato flakes)
-I doubled or tripled the amount of golden syrup so that it would stick together a little better.  (I just added it until it seemed dense enough)
-I used sultanas instead of raisins so it would be easier to chew - just toss some raisins in boiling water until they're plump and tender.  I used both black and golden raisins.

I baked them in a metal pan, and next time I would cut the time by 5-7 minutes because they ended up a little tough around the edges.

They turned out great!  They make a great snack for me during classes!  I miss England!

I disagree (respectfully) with the previous reviewers who said this recipe doesn't work as is.  I followed it to the "T," making sure to completely melt the sugar and corn syrup and brown sugar.  It takes a little longer, but it's worth it.  I used "quick oats" and easily fit all 3 cups worth in with the melted mixture by just mixing one cup at a time.  I pressed it all into a pan (greased the bottom only) which help it to stick together better, too, and I used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  I would bake it for the full 30 minutes next time as it was a little bit soft from less time.  But the big key is cooling completely.  I tried them before that and the parts that were still warm broke apart while the pieces completely cooled stayed together.  During my time living in England, I tasted quite a few variations of flapjacks.  These definitely tasted authentic.  ENJOY!

Absolutely delicious and stuck together well. I have had problems with crumbly flapjack in the past! I followed the advice from some of the reviews and used 10 tbsp golden syrup instead of 4, porage instead of rolled oats and sultanas instead of raisins.

Too many oats.  It didn't even stay together.  When I put them in the pan with the other ingredients I knew it was too much.  Cooking time was too long.  The bottom and edges burned at 350 for 30 mins.  I reccomend 17-20 mins.  I took some out at 17 mins and they were okay with flavor, but still fell apart.

Flavor wasn't spectacular.  Tastes like buttery sugary oats.  Big deal.  Whoopie.

Next time I'll cut down the oats, or use another recipe.  Or maybe rolled oats means something other than the stuff you get from Quaker.

These are delicious but i agree with some of the other reviews there are too many oats so i decreased the amount a bit and they came out great. My family like them as a little treat. Sometimes i like to use a little bit of honey instead as i think that is a good idea. Thanks for the person who sugested the honey and to the person who put the english flapjack on this site.

I cut down the amount of oats slightly to improve the recipe, as I agree there are slightly too many oats. However, with this alteration they tasted much nicer, and one of my friends even used this recipe in their school!

Mum used to make flapjacks all the time, and I was hoping these would be as good as hers. They weren't. Far fom it. Flapjacks should be moist and stick-in-your-teeth gooey. These were extremely dry and, as others have noted, they easily broke apart. I think the cook time is too long in this recipe, and also that there needs to be much more sugar/butter binder. I'll try this next time. Thanks anyway.

Mmmm.  Caramelly, buttery, toasted oats...what's not to love?  I did use Lyle's golden syrup and highly recommend that for flavor.  Honey would be my second choice because it's similar in  consistency...corn syrup may have the same texture but it doesn't bring any flavor to the party.  I added a splash of vanilla, and I cut oats back to a little over 2 1/2 cups.  I wanted some chewiness in the bars.  I used black raisins which worked well, but I think the bars are perfectly suited to a little more tang, and next time I make them (there will be a next time!), I'll use dried tart cherries or cranberries.  And nuts would be a great addition, too.  So simple and yet so tasty!

This is very similar to what in my family is called "Petrified Porridge".  :-) So simple and quick to make with kids. I just made some with my 3-year-old and we had a blast! Only change was honey instead of syrup and I cut it to 2 tbsp because I thought it was sweet enough already. If you use the larger pan as I did, be sure to reduce the baking time accordingly; mine was only 1/2 inch thick and so was ready in just over half the suggested time!

Rather than adding the sugar, I added 2 extra tbsp honey. These are good. I would make these again.

I left out the raisins on this one, but being English I can confrim this is a very authentic recipe, you do need to buy golden syrup though to get the true taste

Really easy and tasty.  I usually replace the syrup with honey because that's what I have on hand.  Also, like others, I only bake it for 17-19 minutes.  It might seem too soft when you cut, but it will set as it cools to a firm chewy bar.  Any longer in the oven and it tends to end up too crispy or burned, at least in my oven.

Great. To me the squares are just like granola bars. I replaced 1/2 cup of oats with 1/4 of dates and 1/4 of pecans. Glad I did. Nuts is a must ingredient
in these kind of sweets... They are hard, but very addictive.. thanks!

Good basic recipe; great with a few changes. I always bake a double batch in a 13x9" pan 20 minutes or til very golden. The bars are 3/4 or 7/8" thick, reminiscent of granola bars. CHANGES: Only use 3 Tbsp golden syrup (use real golden syrup for best results... Lyle's) and use 5+1/4 cups quick oats. (I substitute 1+1/4 cup regular rolled oats for more texture). I omit raisins. If you cannot find Lyles, the best substitute is 2 Tbsp light corn syrup + 1 Tbsp honey. Neither one is as good as the combination, but Lyles is best for flavor, texture, and holding together. These are a staple in my house! They will crumble  if eaten before they cool completely.

After reading other reviews I did the following. I melted butter with syrup and brown sugar and brought just to a boil.  I added 2 1/2 c oats.  I baked 20 minutes.  Excellent!  Oh I also added some chopped dried apricots and slivered slmonds along with raisans.

I never had a Flapjack and was happy to have found this recipe to try. I love oats and this makes for an indulgent sweet treat. Someone else best described the taste like buttery sweet carmel popcorn but made with oats. I found there to be enough liquid to mix with the oats and I brought those ingredients to a boil and then took it off ensuring the ingredients were well mixed. I patted it down in a foil lined 8 x 8 pan and it was about 3/4" thick. I didn't add the raisins. You have to cool this completely and I mean for a good 2 hours or so if you are having problems with it falling apart. Everything has to set up and that takes time. I cut them about half way through cooling and they of course did not have a clean cut because of the oats but that is to be expected. My bottoms were a bit chewy and not crisp like the tops but it was all good and delicious.

Very easy to make and yet very tasty. I took it to work and gave it to people I work with and many liked it more than the granola bars we get in stores. From now on I am noy going to buy granola bars. It's easier and quicker and healthier to make these than buying. Thanks a lot MISSRUSSELL18.

I tried making with dates and that was good too. I will update when I try making it with fresh or dried fruits.

I would like this if it were less crunchy.  I might try this again and bake it for less time.  Excellent flavor and great for the kids lunches.

Not at all what I was looking for, but very good.  I spread mine out extra thin and baked them for 25 minutes.  It tasted like carmel oats instead of carmel corn, only slightly less sweet.

I made these and they were DELICIOUS, i am so happy with how they turned out, my only adjustment was I used 1 cup of syrup as it was too crumbly with only 4 spoons

Excellent recipe. and Ispeak from British experience! A previous contributor says make sure to melt the sugar - very important. Another said the oats is too much - it isn't - keep stirring! It is also very important to flatten it down really well in the pan before cooking and then let it cool completely before cutting. Voila!

Utterly delicious! Ours came out a little gooey, so I may work with the recipe. OTOH, part of the reason that they're so good is that they're gooey!

Very disappointed!  I'm not kidding, I've had to chisel these things out of the pan.  I shall find a use for the remains, but not at all the chewy bars I've had in the UK.  I suspect too much corn syrup and too much cooking time.  I'll not make these again.

This recipe made really crispy flapjacks, more like a granola. I followed the recipe to the T and they still were not right. The flavor was awesome, but very hard to eat. So, I am modifying the recipe to be softer and using rice syrup instead of corn syrup.

Yummy, but also crumbly and fell apart - couldn't cut into bars.  I substituted agave nectar and maple syrup for the golden syrup.

Very good and easy to make. I omitted the raisins and they were fine. Just what I was looking for.

Just made some of these they taste and look great. You can also use chopped dried apricots rather than sultanas or raisins just make sure to chop them nice and small though and keep an eye on them as they cook mine were ready at 25 mins 30 and they would have been overdone in my oven

Need to watch it. Lower oven temp for convection. Maybe just change to 325F.

Very easy to make. I followed the directions and got a delicious result. Plenty of stirring after the sugar has dissolved must be key as I had no problem getting the mixture to come together with the ingredients as listed.  While it was still hot I cut through but left them in the pan.  I lined the baking dish with parchment paper and when completely cold, I lifted them out and finished the cutting.  Very little crumbling - no more than when I make cookies.  I added dried sour cherries - next time I'll add chopped up dates

I made this flapjack but it came out too hard. I followed the recipe, or so I thought, although I used honey rather than golden syrup. Any ideas of what went wrong or how I might retrieve the situation?

Pretty good although it was crumbly when it came out. It may not have cooled enough. It came out like a soft baked granola. It was tasty though. I give it four stars.

Yeah, mine crumbled so look at other reviews for how to prevent that. It was still basically the best granola I've ever had, so it was worth it haha.

Taste is good, a very simple granola bar, though I had to chisel this out of the pan, and it crumbled easily when it was soft. Maybe I should try honey instead?

Not a bad taste, but not quite what I was looking for. I added less oats because of the comments, and that def. helped make them stick together.
