I didn't have any water chestnuts, so I didn't use any. I also added some chopped garlic. It was a big hit! Definitely will make again!

This is a fantastic recipe. It yields quite a bit so I gave some to my neighbors -they devoured them before they even walked in the house. The only thing that I will change for next time would be to either completely omit the water chestnuts or cut them into much smaller pieces. Other than that I wouldn't change anything.

My family loved these. I made for super bowl. I did use water on finger to moisten the edges help keep them closed when folding them before deep frying. Would make these again. Used my mom's sweet n sour sauce for dipping. Great!!!(the only thing I would do different next time is chop my water chestnuts much smaller with my chopper)

I've never fried anything before. Not because I'm all healthy, just because hot grease scares me. Oh heavens, am I glad I jumped it and made these. They are delish and really easy to make. I happened to get hot pork sausage by mistake and what a fantastic mistake it turned out to be. Thank you!!

The filling tastes superb! The proportions are spot-on, even when I used shredded chicken instead of pork. I dont like the idea of frying them. I also must have used the wrong kind of wrapper (my selection is very limited here) and may go with a lumpia wrapper next time.

I hate to be the first to write a low review, but I personally didn't like, I will continue to search for better tasting fillings.

Great easy recipe, just left out the water chestnuts and used fresh chives. Was perfect for my class, even with ground turkey!

Rich and delicious, but you really need a lot of prep time. It's easier with a two-person team - one to fry and one to fill.

Made this recipe exactly as stated. The wonton skins were a bit difficult to separate and it would be extremely helpful if you had 2 people making these (one to spoon filling into wonton and the other to fold them). These were tedious to make but extremely delicious and well worth it!

Great, I added more ginger and substituted shrimp for the pork. If you leave out the water chestnuts you have made a big mistake!

WONDERFUL TREAT !! Easty to make (although time consuming it was a fun recipe). Yields a whole lot, so the left-overs are in a zip lock, sure to be used up quickly. Made exactly per posted recipe. Thanks for sharing - will check out more of your recipes.

These were THE HIT of the party!!! However, I only used ONE can of water chestnuts and really finely chopped it up. I made 70 wontons and they were GONE before I knew it!! Now that I know how to make them, I will make them ALL the time for parties and get togethers. It was sooooo good and so worth the time. Definitely prepare the meat mixture the night before. It's so worth it to allow all the flavors to blend over night. I'm telling you, best appetizer I made that went faster than lightening!

I don't have the patience with the wonton wrappers but I use everything else and turn them into meat balls with shrimp and gravy. Yum!

I made this recipe excluding the water chestnuts.  The recipe was absolutely delicious!  I think better than Chinese take out.  I would recommend this recipe.

I loved the wontons! I used the water chestnuts and they tasted delicious. Make sure to get enough ginger into each wonton.
