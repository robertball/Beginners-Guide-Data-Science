Let me qualify my review by first saying this: I did not use the dough part of this recipe, I used my own.  That being said, this was a pretty good recipe.  It tastes like a Reuben sandwich without the corned beef.  There was a bit too much caraway seed for my taste, and I would've put the bacon on top to get more crispy as it baked.  My husband also suggested frying the sauerkraut to take the edge off of it - too much vinegar taste, I guess.  Overall though, I would say it was pretty good!  And, the longer I sit here munching, the more the flavour is growing on me!  Time to stop eating!  ;o) I would make this again with a few minor modifications.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I am not crazy about caraway seeds and sauerkraut.  I leave them out, even if I am German!  Otherwise it is delicious!

This was terrific. Wish I'd had a dry Alsatian Riesling to go with it, but this was great for dinner outside on a hot night with beer and a salad. My store didn't have fresh yeast (apparently it's a "seasonal" item) so I used .25 ounce instant yeast. I also used 1/4 cup ghee instead of the full 1/3 cup clarified butter, and whole milk yogurt in place of sour cream. I baked the tart in a pan on parchment for the first half of baking, and then finished it on a baking stone for a good crisp crust. It's delicious cold for lunch, too. Ausgezeichnet!
