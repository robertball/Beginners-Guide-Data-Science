Very versatile recipe.  If you don't have something, then leave it out.  If you have something the recipe doesn't call for, then add it.  I recommend chopping the carrots really small, I think it's weird when you get a big crunchy carrot next to a soft noodle, but when the carrots are small the texture is just right.

I made this salad a couple of weeks ago to "test" it for our daughter's graduation party.  I'm making it tomorrow for her party - absolutely wonderful.  I added some pepperoni chunks, garlic and sliced black olives.  This recipe did well to sit for about 8 hours before eating - would suggest eating it within 24 hours as all the ingredients tasted the same the next day.  Really good salad - can't wait to have it again tomorrow!

This salad is really great.  I followed it to a "T" except I misread the "Red Gold Basil, etc." and put in Rotel tomatoes with Green Chilis.  It turned out fabulous.  Everyone actually liked the bite the green chilis gave it.  Who knew?  I will try it the "right way" and see the difference.

This was very good, but I thought the dressing was overkill so I used about 4 oz. instead.

I made this recipe for my daughter's graduation party last month and have been asked to make it twice since. It is excellent and has now "my" pasta salad to my family.

great salad.  Didn't have the canned tomatoes so added fresh along with extra (a lot extra) of the dried spices and fresh garlic that are added into the canned tomatoes. My husband suggested maybe adding some mango to it.  I plan on trying that the next time I make this salad.

Good pasta salad.  Standard.  But nothing super-fancy.  It lacked 'kick' so, I added pepperocino peppers.  Tasted delish!

The deli around town here has something similar to this, but without most of the vegetables. This was easy to make and very refreshing. Unfortunately we don't have the red gold brand here so I had to make do with regular garlic, tomatoes, oregano and basil. It was still wonderful. I even added the mozzarella cheese.

After tasting it, I ended up adding a lot more Italian dressing because I couldn't taste it that much.
