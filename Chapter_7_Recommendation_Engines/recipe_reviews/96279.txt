First of all, I have to say, hey - cooking requires common sense, along with measuring cups and spoons, ingredients, etc.  Let's not be soooo picky and simply ENJOY what people care to share with us!  We must remember the reason for the season - and for the entire year while we're at it.  

This won rave reviews at my family party yesterday - and I made it just as it was stated.  Perhaps I'll tweek it next time, but my husband and I always make a new recipe as it's written the first time - then we add/subtract to suit our tastes and needs.

Merry Christmas, one and all!!

I would start by ignoring any reviewers that did not follow the directions and gave it less than 5 stars. The recipe clearly says to pour the sauce over the cream cheese so make sure you do that.  The sauce is great as a dip with the cream cheese, or you can use it as a relish. Great recipe as-is!

I have to agree with Willow, if you completely change a recipe how can you rate it??? I followed the directions except I didn't have apricot jam so I used Peach jam that was on hand. I followed the directions and POURED the mixture over room temperature cream cheese.  Severed it with crackers and it was a hit.

This recipe is a great addition to a Christmastime appetizer buffet, simple to make and pleasing to the eye. Easy and delicious, just what I'm looking forward when things are so busy. I'm also puzzled by reviewers who add their own twist or don't carefully read  a recipe and then proceed to give a recipe a lower rating because of their mistake! Indeed the recipe "did not state when to add the cream cheese," however it DID say, "...pour dip over the block of cream cheese on a serving dish." At any rate, the recipe is a keeper as written - guests scarf it up!

Really good, easy to do on the stove, takes about 10-15 minutes. 3/4 C sugar works well. I spread the softened cream cheese on a pie plate and pour mix over, more colorful than stirring it all together.

I have always loved cranberry sauce and never thought to do this.  I'll use orange marmalade which is a wonderful complement to the cranberries.  Super!

I took this to a Christmas party last night with pretzels to dip it in, and got some rave reviews.  However, I had made some changes to the recipe (due to time and lack of ingredients), and thought I would probably change some things in the future.  I used dried cranberries, not fresh.  I candied the cranberries and sugar in a pot on the stove, rather than in the oven.  I added the jam to the pot, and then once that was mixed together, I added the cream cheese (the recipe didn't state when to add the cream cheese).  It really changed the consistency and flavor of the cream cheese big time, and I ended up adding another 4 oz of it to give it a bit more of that flavor.  I think in the future, I would still do the cranberries the same (but use probably 1/4 cup sugar), but let the mixture cool before adding the cream cheese.

I made this dip for a Holiday social at work. It was a huge hit. Everyone was asking for the recipe. I used walnuts instead of pecans and it was still great. Thanks, will make again.

Awesome! I used raspberry jam instead of apricot because that's what I had. Everyone LOVED it! I used two packages of cream cheese, softened, and spread into the bottom of a pretty pie pan. I've made it twice, once in the oven and once on the stove top. Both turned out great. The second time I reduced the sugar a bit, and it was still awesome. Thanks for a great recipe.

I wanted to make this in the spring, but cranberries weren't in season. I got creative and tried frozen rhubarb with cherry jelly. I used 3/4 c of sugar. It was tart and yummy!

Absolutely amazing! My friend gave me the idea when she brought it to a party and I made the same dish the next day for some company. It's a great crowd pleaser! It's the perfect appetizer for any meal and the unique dish is a good conversation-starter. It is super easy to make but just make sure to start it the day before so you can refrigerate it. It is very sweet so you may want to put a little less sugar than 1 cup but then again, who doesn't like sweetness? My only complaint is that it isn't the healthiest with all of cream cheese and sugar but it tastes great so it's hard to be negative about it. It makes a very large portion of the cranberry/apricot topping so for small crowds, you may want to use a little less of each ingredient. It tastes good with butter crackers and pretzels. I recommend this to everyone. Enjoy and happy cookin'!

This was a hit at Thanksgiving this year. I will say that there was more cranberry dip than cream cheese. That was easily solved with another block or cream cheese! The pretzels were a favorite over crackers, the mixture of sweet and salty was just perfect!

Yep, this is a keeper.  I made this for a gathering and am sharing the recipe today with friends.  I made it as it is written, I spread the cream cheese on a platter and served with a choice of pretzals or the pretzal/townhouse crackers.  I will use 3/4 c. sugar next time.  You won't be disappointed in the sweet-salt combination of this option.

This is a winner!  Served with pretzels at a party and brought home an empty bowl.  That always speaks volumes!

My cranberries didn't "pop" too well in the oven at 30 minutes, so I added 10 and then still took a pastry blender to the berries to sorta smash them.  Worked well, though and the end result was great.

Very wonderful. And festive for holidays. I rate 4 stars as written and 5 stars if you leave out the nuts. I wouldn't call it dip, as it must be served poured over cream cheese. Not  good without the cream cheese. Covers more than one block. Put a knife in for guests to use to spread it. Too stout to just use a cracker to to scoop up.

OK, I didn't like the taste of this at first.  (Of course I had to try it right after it was cooked!) After it sat in the fridge overnight, it turned into something really amazing!  The cranberries still retained an appropriate amount of tartness, but mellow and sweet.  I cooked the berries and sugar for about 15 minutes on med-low heat in a saucepan, really easy.  Then added the jam and nuts.  Even my hubby who does not like nuts, liked it.  Easy to make, almost addicting appetizer! (And pretty)

This is wonderful and will be in my top appetizer list!  It was simple to make, can be made ahead and tastes devine.  I only used 1/2 the cranberry topping for one block of cream cheese and found it to be plenty.

What a great recipe, haven't tried it yet but will soon. I tend to agree that making the recipe as written the 1st time is a good idea, but having read the reviews will probably start with walnuts & orangemarmalade. For those of you who don't care to cook the cranberries a can of wholeberry cranberry sauce will probably work just as well. Just a thought.

I made this three times this year and people were always surprised at how good it is.  I suggest cutting the cranberry sauce in half; there's way too much for one bar of cream cheese.  You could double the cream cheese, but that's an awful lot of dip!  Also, it looks more appetizing if you spread the cream cheese in a pie plate and pour the cranberry sauce on top.  The third time I made it, I substituted raspberry jam for the apricot and it was even better.  Rather than trying to get it to stick to a pretzel, use pretzel chips and then you can get lots of dip in every bite.

Wow!!! This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving!  So simple to make and excellent combination of flavors.  I served this with mini pretzels but people were grabbing crackers because they said they wanted to be able to scoop up as much as possible!!!

Excellent!  Made it just as the recipe stated. Took it to my Christmas potluck luncheon for about 60 people and it was a hit.  So so good.  I think next time I will try something different for the presentation.  Thinking about spreading the cream cheese out on a platter (like with surprise spread or 7 layer dip) and spreading the cranberry mixture over top.

Yum! Yum!  This is a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving.  Definitely, don't serve this right away - it has to sit for at least 2 hrs (I didn't think overnight is necessary).  My husband didn't like it when I made it, but later in the day he loved it!! The flavors blended so nicely.  I didn't have pecans and used walnuts.  Delish!

Amazing recipe!  This was the overall favorite at my last get together at work.  I used 1/2 the sugar and it was still  great.  This will be added to the list of recipes used on the holidays, it was great.

I thought this was pretty, tasty and interesting, but on a table with many appetizers it was barely touched. Maybe it was just too unusual for the crowd that was present.

This is my "go to" dip from Thanksgiving through Christmas!  I've been making it for 2 years and I love it!   The only comment I have is that it makes a lot, so I freeze half of the dip to use at another gathering, or I put it over 2 blocks of cream cheese if I plan on using the whole dip.  YUMMY!

This was yummy!  I made two modifications.  I didn't have any apricot jam so I used pineapple preserves  and it great!  Also, I made it on the stove top.  I boiled the sugar in some water while I rinsed and sorted the berries then popped them in the water to boil and pop.   It's a very easy recipe.

YUM !  I mixed some sour cream in with the cream cheese to make it softer and more dippable. And, prior to pouring the sauce over the top, I  spread the cheese out over my high sided glass plate instead of leaving the cheese in a block. A beautiful presentation and everyone at the party loved it! The small pretzels are perfect with it.

I made this just a little different. I combined the cranberries, half the sugar and jam with a touch of orange juice and orange zest. Because I had NO room in my oven, I brought this up to a boil on my stove and cooked until the cranberries started to pop. I took it off the heat, and once the sauce cooled a bit, I stirred in the pecans. Don't know about a dip but this was a nice cranberry sauce. Different. My kids especially liked it.

Great recipe!!!! Made it last year and will make it again for New Years with friends. Only change I made was less sugar to make it more tart, great on turkey too.

This was actually pretty good.  I did cut the sugar by half, and it was still sweet enough, but tart also.  My husband put some on a piece of cheesecake and said it was yummy.

I have made this at least 10 times and every time it has received rave reviews. I agree that if you do not follow the instructions then you cannot give it a low rating. Make it as is.

This dip was amazing. It was so delicious and pretty for a holiday party. Using the measurements from the recipe, I had enough for 3 bricks of cream cheese.

OMG..you can't find a simpler recipe.  And....it's delicious!!!!  I ended up using 12 ounces of jam (instead of 8 ounces).  It was an oversight, but it worked out just fine.  I might even try putting apricots in the mix next time.  It started out as a dip, but my Thanksgiving host ended up putting it on the table for a side dish with dinner.  YUMMY!!!

This was okay.  Was just way too much like homemade cranberry relish for your Thanksgiving table.  I am gauging this rating by the amount of dip that was left in the dish at the end of the party (and I did follow the directions exactly).

5 stars.  I made it twice and this dip was a hit at both gatherings and it couldn't be any easier to make.  I only used 2/3 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet enough.  Made it on the stove top by combining sugar with 1/3 cup water in a saucepan over medium/low heat until sugar dissolved and mixture started to boil.  Added the sorted, rinsed cranberries and cooked for 11 minutes, stirring about every minute or so.  I chose to release a bit more of the juices by lightly mashing in the pan after removing from the heat but before stirring in the nuts and jam (I used walnuts and apricot preserves and it turned out great).   This recipe is enough for 2 blocks of cream cheese, so if you are only serving at a smaller gathering, freeze the other half in a plastic container (just thaw by placing in the fridge the night before use, so works great as a make-ahead).  I prefer to serve this dip by spreading a softened block of cream cheese in a shallow glass container and covering with the cranberry mixture before serving.  Served with buttery round crackers in order to spread more goodness into every bite.  Thanks so much for posting this beautiful, delicious, festive recipe!

I have zero interest in cranberry sauce but always felt like it was an essential part of the holiday season. This recipe has saved cranberries from being left out of my holiday dinner. This is the only way to eat cranberries. It is so good with pretzels that I crave it. Thank you!

Oh my! This is absolutely wonderful. Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe. My husband loves orange marmalade so I used that. Put the cranberries and sugar in the oven while I continued with other dishes. Stirred in the marmalade and pecans when baking was done and into the fridge to rest overnight. I poured over cream cheese as stated. It was beautiful on the plate and my guests loved it. So did I. This will be a staple for my holidays and any other time in between. Thanks again.

Mine didn't turn out well, but I'm giving this one more star since I think it would be better if I had followed the directions.  I doubled the recipe for a party and spread it in a pan, but it was too thin and no one could get any on their pretzels, so it remained pretty much untouched.  If I had kept it as a block, I think more people would have eaten it.

This has an AWESOME flavor, but is nearly impossible to use as a "dip." the cream cheese stays too stiff.

This recipe is awesome! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't add or change a thing. I made this recipe for Christmas eve with family and friends and everyone was raving about it and asking for the recipe! It's easy, it's festive, it's a beautiful presentation, it would even be nice for a Valentine's Day celebration or anytime for that matter! This recipe really makes alot so I think next time I will use 2 packages of cream cheese with it. Thanks so much for this recipe...this will definitely be a part of our Christmas every year!

This was a huge hit. A nice combination of sweet with the cheese. I sprinkled the pecans on top instead of in the cranberries. This way those who don't care for pecans can move around them. Will definitely make this again.

Easy and a hit with all that tried it.  This one will be on my short list to take to parties. I have made this recipe a second time using the orange marmalade  and a suggestion was made that this would be great for brunch on toasted bagels.

It is a very tasty recipe and everyone liked it. (I used peach preserves instead of apricot because that is what I had.) I had about half of it leftover and it did not look good with cream cheese bits mixed in with the cranberries. So I blended it all together, the cream cheese with the cranberries (in a food processor). It turned out delicious and was a pretty pink color. Next time I will make the recipe with half the cranberries blended into the cream cheese and pour the other half of the prepared cranberries over it.

I took a leap of faith and brought this to a holiday girls' night with some pretzel crisps (the flat pretzels that are like chips). THIS WAS DELICIOUS! I omitted the pecans (allergic) but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. It was a crowd favorite! I had to make another batch to snack on at home (hint: it is to DIE for paired with a cuppa' orange spice tea). Definite winner!

Very Good recipe; I am still trying to find the "right" item to serve with it. Crackers, in my opinion, not so good; pretzel sticks (the larger dipping ones) are good. Still think there should be something else that can be used to "dip" with!!!

Everyone loves this dip!  I serve it over a block of cream cheese (it makes enough for 2 blocks) with ritz crackers.  Perfect combination of sweet with a little tang/creamy/salty.  The only changes I made were: I cooked the berries and sugar on the stovetop on low till they popped. I also used peach jam instead of apricot.

I have made this a few times and it is always a hit. I heat the cranberries on the stove instead of the oven, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly.I served it with rosemary crackers from Trader Joes and I had no leftovers.

Made this the first time for a get together for the women at church.  I had requests for the recipe and it was so easy I was able to remember it by heart.  This is a super easy way to enjoy cranberries for the holidays.  My husband got to taste it and said he really liked it. I intend to make this every year.

Cant believe the people who go on about remembering the reason for the season and then proceed to trash someone for "not reading a recipe" or "not measuring" or having common sense, etc. How hypocritical... Thanks for the recipe & the tips. Worked great with the can of whole cranberry sauce.

Too sweet; kind of like dipping up cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  I tried to mix in the cream cheese to make it easier to dip and it just didn't look very appetizing.  Won't make again.

Delicious! I made this for a cocktail party that I hosted last night and everyone loved it. The cranberries took about 45 minutes in the oven and I used fat free cream cheese, I would definetly make this again!

Great recipe, very easy to make.  I skipped the pecans and doubled the cream cheese (which i think was necessary or there would've been lots of the cranberry mixture leftover.  Was a HUGE hit.

I tried this recipe for the first time this year for Thanksgiving, brought it to my family gathering and it was an instant classic.  My entire family raved about it and practically demanded that this become a new holiday tradition for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I followed the recipe exactly, just omitting the pecans because of the people who didn't like nuts in the group, Served it on a simple white square plate and whala.. at the end of the night, not a single bite was left.  Simply amazing!!  So happy I found this one!

I made this mainly for the color next to the quacamole for Christmas.  But OMG, this was such a huge surprise for taste.  No one could stop eating it.  I made it exactly as the recipe called.  My only advice is that when you cook the cranberries put them in a pot with tall sides, it started overflowing all over my oven.

It was a great hit at the party!  There was a lot of dip compared to the cream cheese though, so I'm not sure it looked great, but it tasted wonderful.  I made it exactly as per the recipe (except I didn't let the cream cheese warm enough).

Very good.  Incredibly simple, and very nice.  A good addition to the dishes at the housewarming party we went to this afternoon.  It also has the happy result of using up the remaining cranberries in my freezer from last year and using up the jam in my fridge.  I didn't have apricot jam, but I did have peach, so I used that, which worked fine.  I didn't have quite enough jam but it was still plenty flavorful and sweet.  Everyone seemed to love the dip, and I left it there bc the hostess loved it.  thanks for the recipe!

Made this dip twice lately because I loved it so much.  I made it the first time with sugar free apricot preserves and Splenda and the second time with sugar free orange marmalade and Splenda.  I am diabetic and this enabled me to eat more as it was so delicious. :-) The dip with the orange marmalade reminded me of the cranberry relish my mom used to make when I was growing up.  I know I will make this much more than I should.  Will try lower fat cream cheese next time.  Pouring the cranberry mixture over the cheese block worked perfectly for me.  Just the right blend of flavors.  I did let it sit overnight in the fridge and really agree that it helped blend the flavors.
Update:
I have made this recently and have decided it might be easier to dip if the cream cheese were spread out and the cranberry mixture spread out to make a two layer dip. I have used fat free cream cheese and it worked for me but low fat would probably work best for most people. ??

Delicious.  Exactly the type of recipe I was looking for to spoon on top of cream cheese.  So much better then anything I've bought to serve on a cream cheese block!!!  Chop the pecans pretty fine so they fit on the crackers.  Baking the cranberries was perfect you don't have to add any liquid.  Great recipe...thank you!!

This is really good and pretty.  I made it almost just like the recipe.  I used walnuts instead of pecans, just because that's what I had more of.  I used sugar free apricot jam and 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar to reduce the sugar.  I took it to work for a Christmas potluck and several people asked for the recipe.

I thought this sounded so interesting, I had to try it.  I got lots of positive comments at the party I took it to.  We dipped pretzels, crackers and bagel pieces into it.  It was a little hard to get it out with the bagels.  But, I don't think I let it sit out of the fridge long enough to soften up.  I'll definitely make it again.

You can't go wrong with the jam you use in this recipe. In my frig I had 1/4 cup of apricot spread and 3/4 cup of a fancy fig and orange jam. I took it to a party and everyone loved it. I made the whole batch, but only used 1/2 of it with an 8-ounce block of cream cheese. It was more than enough! This morning I had it on toasted bagels. Great recipe.

We liked this but be aware that it makes a very large amount.  If it's a small gathering you will want to cut the recipe.

This was delicious. I took it to work and it was a big hit, everyone asked for the recipe. The only thing I did different was that I used 2 pkgs. of cream cheese because there is a lot of the cranberry mixture.

It's much easier and economical to cook the berries & sugar in a saucepan.  Takes very little time! And it's THE tasiest! Pour over cream cheese, then spread on turkey sandwiches. YUMMM

This dip went over quite well as an appetizer at Thanksgiving.  I made the recipe as stated, and I served with both pretzels & round, buttery crackers.  Super easy to make.  Will most likely make it again at Christmas!

I made the recipe pretty much exactly how it is written. I spread the cream cheese into the bottom of a serving dish and then poured about HALF of the cranberry mixture on top, and froze the rest to make another at Christmas. I left out the pecans bc I didn’t have any. It was delicious! Be sure to make the cranberry mixture the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator, it totally changes the flavor. I also sprinkled the top with slivered almonds. It was beautiful and delicious!

Very tasty recipe and big hit with my guests. Served with mini pretzels because they are sturdier to hold up to dipping into cream cheese. I used Truvia stevia blend.

This was easy, and a hit at the party.  I used peach preserves because that was easier to find.  After cooking the cranberries, it smelled really strong and I was concerned it may not taste good.  But I recalled that  refrigerating overnight was essiential from another reviewer, and proceded to mix the cranberries with the preserves and left in the fridge overnight.  In the morning, I tasted it, and it was so good!  I poured it over cream cheese, sprinkled with chopped pecans, and it was delicious!  I think it is prettier to sprinkle the pecans rather mix them in the sauce like I see in some photos.  This does make a lot of cranberry dip, I had to add another block (and maybe another!) to make the ratios work.  Will make again!

I had to make a few changes, but overall the recipe was a smash hit. Our small town ran out of fresh cranberries, so I used the dried ones, then I grabbed the wrong preserves, and wound up using peach. that being the case everyone still loved it. I had some left over in a small bowl, and people ate it instead of cranberry sauce. thanks for the recipe.

Definitely cut the sugar in half. (I used Aldi's knock off Splenda, and it was plenty sweet with the orange marmalade jelly option. I added about 2 large teaspoons of fresh grated orange zest to freshen up it when served and also act as garnish. It's a keeper! Sooo good! Great guest reviews.

I made this exactly as described and my family loved it!  I'm making it again today for a holiday party.  The cranberry topping created enough mixture that I'll be spooning over two 8 oz blocks of cream cheese rather than 1 as per the recipe.

I was in charge of dips for Christmas.  I was making a savory dip and wanted something a little bright.   This was a huge hit.  It is sweet but not super sweet because of the cream cheese.   Delish on Ritz and pretzel.   Will def be making again.

I've personally never cared for fresh cranberries. Sorry. Since it's the season and my mom loves them, I gave this a shot. Surprise! I like it. Very simple, fast and very little clean up (if you knew me you would have fallen out by now. I'm usually the one bringing the drinks, chips or paper products to a function .... shhh) Everyone enjoyed and yes, got my mother's seal of approval. Thank you for sharing!

Happy Holidays to all and to all, a good day!

Made it just as the recipe said and loved the taste and ease of making this appetizer. Nice change from the hot pepper relish that I usually serve over a cream cheese block.

This dip rates five stars for 1) taste 2) visual appeal, and maybe most important, 3) ease. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit with the Thanksgiving guests; I'm making it again tonight for the Christmas buffet table. It's tart and sweet and creamy and crunchy all at once and it looks beautiful on the table. I used a common butter cracker at Thanksgiving but purchased a more complex, whole grain cracker for Christmas. I will be making this recipe for years to come.  And by the way: I customarily reduce the sugar in most recipes and started to do this with this one. After taste testing, however, I decided it needed the full 1 cup of sugar.

I made this for Christmas party last night.  It is very festive looking.  Based on other reviewers, I decreased the sugar by one half, and chose to cook the cranberries and sugar on the stove-top, doing this the night before.  Just before serving, I spread the cream cheese out on a clear glass plate, then topped it with the cranberry sauce, leaving a white border all around.  I served it with both pretzels and crackers.  The pretzels seemed to be the more popular choice.  I only used about 1/3 of the sauce on the cream cheese, and that was plenty.  Next time I make it, I will reduce (or omit) the sugar.  I would melt the jam over low heat, then add cranberries and cook until they pop.  My friends, and I do not prefer things overly sweet.  I think the jam would provide sufficient sweetness.

Love this recipe!  My only change is to soften the cream cheese and spread it in an 8x8 or 9x9 glass dish, then pour the cranberry mixture over.  (Like more cream cheese - just use two 8 oz. blocks.) That way, when you dip, you easily get cranberry and cream cheese in every delicious bite!

This went over VERY well at the office Christmas party! I actually made some like the recipe said and some with some habanero jelly. Most liked the touch of spice better than the apricot version. Good!!

I made this for a work party.   I made it exactly as described.   So, so delicious and getting rave reviews.  I tasted it after I combined the ingredients and it was so sweet that I thought it would be gross.  But I let it sit over night and it made a world of difference.  Sweet but not super sweet.   Will absolutely make again!   Plus its easy with a nice presentation.

I added a whole habanero pepper and half of a jalapeño pepper, very finely diced. It kind of tastes like the habanero raspberry sauce from Tastefully Simple, which I may be addicted to.

Followed the recipe to a 'T'.  Served with Brie and cream cheese and assorted crackers.  Good with either cheese.  Can't wait to serve it with our turkey on Christmas.  5 STARS all the way.   Husband loves it!!

I changed apricot jam for marmalade. Cut back on the sugar to compensate. It was still a touch sweet,  but that's my taste. I'd make it again.

I make this every year. It's always a hit for a pre dinner snack, or for taking to a holiday party. I make it just as the recipe states no changes. Ignore the reviewers who gave the negative reviews, this one is easy and really good! Just follow the recipe, cook it in a pot with a lid in the oven then serve over a room temp block of cream cheese and your golden!

I have not made this but want to try. The only thing is there are allergies to pecans. What would be good to substitute or can the pecans be optional. (I want to make one with pecans though!!!!)

This is excellent! The only thing I want to share was we thought there was more than enough to use with other cream cheese blocks then what was called for in the recipe. Other than that it was a home run!

No changes were made and it was a great hit at Christmas. I made it a few times over the holidays for different parties.   I made it for Canada Day as the colours were perfect!
I served it with mini pretzels and nachos.  
Very easy to make and the cream cheese compliments the tartness of the cranberries.

I made NO changes. This will be a regular at family functions! You really don't even need the cream cheese. Or the crackers lol! We were into it with spoons when the crackers ran out. In my experience this makes enough to serve twice with an 8oz. cream cheese each time? I'm not so sure I softened my cream cheese out enough though because we kind of needed a spreading knife with it. My SIL who is a bit reluctant to try new things said "I hate that I love that stuff"!

Excellent appetizer, my husband loved it. I spread the cream cheese in a pie plate and put  half the cranberry recipe on top.
I also froze half the recipe and used it later.

I loved the way this turned out. I used an 8 oz bag of cranberries because there weren't any 12 oz bags so I slightly reduced the other ingredients. It was a big hit with the family. I'll definitely make it again and again.

Great easy recipe! Huge hit for Christmas app!  I totally forgot to make the day before and was in a hurry so I just cooked the cranberries and sugar on stovetop. As others suggested I only used 3/4 cup sugar and cooked on low/med heat so I wouldn't burn sugar.  I was able to refrigerate for 3 hours and the time definitely helped the flavors meld. As others said, this definitely makes a lot of sauce - it was enough to cover 2 blocks of cream cheese (I spread in pie pan) and still had some leftover.  Was asked for the recipe several times.  I'll definitely make again!

The apricot jam really made the dish. however, i made the cranberries according to the package not in the oven. it was simpler that way.

I made 2 batches .. one with pecans, the other without. I also used peach/mango jam as I forgot to buy apricot. Very tasty but too thick to pour so I decided to say spread it over cream cheese and serve with crackers. I made it as an office gift . I also decreased the amount of sugar as the jam adds its own sweetness

Honestly, it's a great dish. It could be a better recipe. Temperature matters to the novice cooks out there. Took me longer because my simmer was too low, but I didn't know that going in. Also, it worked really well with large-diced sirloin filets. Yum!

This is awesome made just as the original recipe states.  Every time I make  it and someone new eats it they always request the recipe.  Great over cream cheese but I use it for Holidays instead of Cranberry sauce.

This was heavenly!  I made it for a Thanksgiving snack food, mostly just because I thought it would be festive-looking. I served it with "Scoops".  It was the hit of the party.  People were ignoring the pies and going for the dip!  The only substitute I made was to use Orange Marmalade instead of the Apricot Jam, because that's what I had - and it had a wonderful flavor with the cranberries.  I wouldn't change it.  Everyone there wanted the recipe, including my 90-year old father!

This was a very easy, and very Yummy.  I cooked the cranberry and sugar (3/4 cup) on the stove top with just a little orange juice on medium heat until they had popped as directed. From there i followed the direction as written.  Make this the day before so it has time to blend all the ingredients.  It was a hit even with family that doesn't like cranberry.

Not a bad base recipe, but waaaaay  too much sugar (for my taste).  I add some orange zest to the mixture, and finely chopped green onion.

Amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was so easy.  I made this for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it even my 4 year old.  People who love cranberries loved it and people who usually don't like cranberries loved it.  Several asked for the recipe.  I served it with Wheat Thins and Ritz Crackers although I preferred the Wheat Thins.

Really good and I will make this again.  Just a few callouts as already mentioned by other reviewers: It's a tad bit sweet for my tastes so I would add a bit less sugar next year.  (I added a bit of OJ to try to offset some of the sweetness.)  I also used raspberry jam instead of apricot (yum!).  And it is a LOT of sauce for one brick of cream cheese so I will use two.  Delish!

Made this last night for my book club ladies.   Followed a few other reviews and I halved everything (except the cream cheese) since many others said it made too much "sauce" and I was feeding a small crowd.  It was a perfect amount to cover the cream cheese.  I cooked everything on the stove top for a few minutes just to save time.  I refrigerated the dip about 7 hours before serving with pretzels.  Will definitely make again for other gatherings..

Eleven ladies came to my home to play Bunco last night.  I made it the morning (night before, next time).  It was vey easy to make. Beauty is you can make it ahead.  Flavor was great and we all enjoyed it. Several Bunco Babes asked for the recipe.

I used orange marmalade instead apricot preserves as I had it on hand. Delicious! The  only change I would make is to sprinkle the chopped pecans on top instead of mixing them in. I am not sure where others got the idea it was to be mixed together.

Very good recipe. A big hit everywhere it goes. After making a few times, I have decreased sugar to 3/4 cup, and omitted nuts and it is still wonderful.

Addictive is all I have to say. So easy and so delicious! I skip the nuts (in case company doesn't like them). This is a go-to appetizer starting from Nov and on. I plan on buying fresh cranberries and freezing them so I'll be able to make these in the months they're not sold. You absolutely can't go wrong making this appetizer!

OMG, This is a keeper. I do not care what anyone else states as well about this recipe. I had one extra bag of fresh cranberries and decided to make this for my co-workers as a treat. THEY LOVED IT!!!! I did it as is and served it on the soften cream cheese with pretzels and crackers. They both went. There was some extra cranberry dip so I saved it in the fridge for when we have turkey next week. Great Recipe Thank you so much we all enjoyed this. Thanks again Elizra, Kathy from CT

I have not tried it yet, but am going too.  It sounds delicious, and is similar to a Cranberry Dip recipe I already love.  Mine is Cranberry Salsa, and has jalapeno peppers in it, but no nuts.  It also called for pouring the dip over the cream cheese, but my daughter and I have always mixed the whole mixture together, and I get good reviews to everyone I have served it too.  Anxious to try this new version of Cranberry Dip.  The cranberries were just grinded instead of cooked, in my version before adding the sugar, and required sitting overnight to make the juice, then draining it.  It took a day a half to complete the recipe.

I tried this for a Christmas party I just had and everyone is asking me for the recipe . Everyone bragged about it and loved it ! Needless to say it all went before I could get any .I made it exactly as recommended except the pecans were honey roasted which probably made it a little sweeter ! I served it with tiny pretzels

OMG - this was excellent! I cut the sugar by 1/4 and feel I could cut it by 1/2 cup without compromising the taste. I also used orange marmalade because that's what I had. Thank you - I will be using this recipe for years to come.

I made this as the recipe stated, tried it, and then added a big dash of cinnamon, a big dash of allspice, and pinches of ginger and cloves. That was JUST what it needed! Good recipe to begin with, great with the spices added!

I made this for a girls weekend winery tour, and everyone loved it. They couldn't stop eating it!  I did reduce the suagr to 3/4 cup and used low sugar jam, as well as used 2 blocks of low fat cream cheese, as the recipe made alot. This is a keeper, and I will be making it again for Christmas Eve.- Nanny

Made this for a holiday party and it was a huge hit!! Pretty sweet so I used 2 blocks of cream cheese instead of 1.  Didn't have pecans so I used mixed nuts and instead of apricot jam I used orange marmalade and it still worked.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I'd call this more of a cracker spread than a dip but it's still wonderful.   If you change a recipe drastically it's kind of pointless to rate the original recipe.....just sayin..

I loved this recipe!! I took it to our family's Christmas party, and by the end of the night, even people who staunchly avoid cranberries couldn't get enough. Quite comical, really. I actually ended up leaving the leftovers (what little there were) at our host's home, because she really couldn't stop eating it. So yes, I will definitely be making this again i the future!

I made the sauce as directed however I used peach/apricot preserves.  There was more than enough sauce for TWO packages of cream cheese.  YUMMY!  Will definately make this beautiful dip again! :-)

Yummy!  Made two batches, one original and one without pecans.  Both taste awesome so far... just put them in the refrigerator:)  I am sure both will be a hit tomorrow for Christmas dinner... Only change I can foresee is needing more cream cheese... but yummy none the less!

Thanks Elizra!

Wonderful addition to my party and this is a very forgiving recipe.  I am allergic to nuts so I left them out.  I also could not find my jam so I had to use the strawberry jam that I had in the fridge.  I served it with the pretzels as suggested.  I had none left over.

1/4 cup of sugar, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla after 
remaking it the second time around yum.

I made this for 3 Christmas parties we hosted this year and it was a huge hit every time.  The first party was for a progressive dinner and everyone insisted we bring it with us to the next house!  I served it over a brick of cream cheese with crackers on the side.  Our kids also liked it with pretzels.  It's really simple to make, the recipe makes a ton and it freezes very nicely.   I will be making this every holiday from now on I'm sure!

Delicious!  I cooked my frozen cranberries on the stove using Splenda instead of sugar and I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water to the pot.  They were ready in about 10 minutes.  Then I added strawberry jam and walnuts to the pot and refrigerated.  Turned out great!  Thank you...I needed a recipe to use up my old, frozen cranberries and this one is quick and easy.

I used orange marmelade rather than apricot jam.  I baked for 45 min so the cranberries were very soft.  I think it is a fabulous appetizer for the holidays.

I made this per the recipe to take to a  party.  It was really easy to make.  There was more than enough to "frost" 16 ounces of cream cheese.  The recipe makes more than needed and so we had extra so I tried it a day or so later with Brie and it was very good.  Then we tried it over vanilla ice cream and it was also tasty.  As suggested by someone else in a previous post, I may try making it using orange marmalade in place of the apricot jam just to see what happens.
