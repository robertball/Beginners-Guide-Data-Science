Overall, this isn't too bad of a cocoa mix, and it comes together super super quick too. I found it to be lacking in the chocolate flavor for our tastes--so I would use more cocoa powder next time. I also subbed powdered stevia for the Equate, and that worked just fine for us. I followed the instructions to add 1/3 cup of the mix to a mug of hot water to make the cocoa, and found that to be way too much mix. It had sort of a powdery flavor that wasn't enjoyable. So about 3 tbsps of mix to a mug of hot water was much more pleasant. Adding in some vanilla extract makes it even tastier as well. Thanks for the recipe!
