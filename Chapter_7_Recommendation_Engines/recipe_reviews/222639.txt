I cut the salt back to a half teaspoon and I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. I made no other changes or substitutions. I baked this in my Perfect Brownie Pan, baked at 350* this was done in 33 minutes. Though these brownies turned out exactly as the submitter stated (PERFECTLY chewy and just chocolate-y enough), I missed the flavor that butter gives to brownies. I will make thes again and use butter next time in place of the oil.

Thank you for the ratings, I am honored you chose my recipe to make.  I did make a typo it should be 1/2 teaspoon not 11/2 t.  Sorry ..

These are the best brownies I have ever had, including fancy ones from coffee shops. Years from now, my children will not know to properly give you credit for this recipe. It will probably be the thing that they brag about me for, and the reason their schools make sure I always know about the bake sale. So, I thank you now. I also curse you, because I have diabetes and have had to exercise an unreasonable amount of willpower since making them. Don't worry, I am sharing!(I also skipped the glaze. I don't even want to KNOW how they taste with that.) Again, from the bottom of my vial of insulin, I thank you. Its not like I wouldn't have eaten a brownie, but it is nice when it is a brownie WORTH eating.

I took note of the first reviewers comment on the salt.  I dropped the salt to 1 teaspoon and I found it to be plenty - could probably drop it to 3/4 tsp w/ good results too.  Instead of incorporating the walnuts into the batter I sprinkled them on top.  When you mix the nuts into the batter they get steamed.  By adding the nuts on top of the batter they will get toasted and give a better texture.

These were just good enough.  I prepared them in mini muffin pans with the intention of prettying them up with a rosette of vanilla buttercream frosting, festive Christmas sprinkles and a Hershey's mint truffle kiss.  Good thing. On their own the brownies are fairly nondescript -more cake-like than chewy (reduce or eliminate the baking powder next time) and not deeply chocolate enough (next time substitute a couple of tablespoons of cocoa to replace same amount of flour and maybe add a teaspoon or two of espresso powder or instant coffee granules to intensify the chocolate flavor).  This in spite of the fact I'm sure these were improved merely because I used (melted) butter instead of the vegetable oil.  The frosting and mint truffle kiss gave the impression then, that these brownies were much better than they really were.

I made these for my boys for an after school snack.  I just used a pinch of salt and I used agave nectar instead of the corn syrup (b/c that's what I had on hand).  The kids called them "BEAST!"......that's good! :)  Thanks for the recipe!!

OH MY GOD!!! This brownie recipe is the best I've ever tried!! My whole family loves it and I'm definitely using this recipe from now on:) I followed the recipe but instead of nuts I added 1 cup of dark baking chocolate. From my picture you can see how the chocolate melted beautifully inside the brownie making it into a chocolatey gooey goodness. Thank you for making my day

These were AWESOME! I cut recipe in half, used 1/2 c. of cocoa, cut salt to 1/2 teaspoon and added a 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda. Baked for only 25 minutes in a 8x8 glass pan and they turned out perfectly - exactly as promised - slightly crisp edges and chewy middles. I did not bother to frost; they smelled so good, I had to sample after they cooled slightly. HEAVENLY!

I used self rising flour instead of all purpose so I eliminated the salt and baking powder. Recipe is exactly as titled, Chewy.  Even the edges that are usually hard, were perfect. I didn't add the icing either because the brownies are perfect without it.  I have saved this and will use it from now on.  My family and I love it!

LOVE THEM. My son And I Have Been Really Disappointed In Box Brownie Lately. The Have Cut The.Mix In The Box And You Get Super Thin Brownies. These Have Super Texture And Just The Right Chocolate Flavor. Never Making Boxed Brownies Again. I Will Note That I Did Only Use 1.5 Cups Of Sugar As I Tend To Like Things A Tad Less Sweet. It Was Perfect For Us.

These brownies delivered on being moist and chewy, but didn't have the deep chocolate flavor I was hoping for.  I replaced 1/2 c oil with 1/2 c  melted butter and added 1/2 tsp instant espresso to accentuate the chocolate, but still felt the recipe needs more kick.  I will definitely make these again but may add some melted semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate to the wet ingredients to give them more depth.

These brownies were...dare I say it...salty? The texture was MARVELOUS. Absolutely everything that a nice, warm, chewy brownie should be. But the actual flavor wasn't quite there. It could have used a little more chocolate and a lot less salt!

On a side note, I also had to bake my batch for an additional 10 minutes and they are still fairly moist.

This recipe was easy to make and helped me out in a jiffy when our first batch of frozen brownies went bad. I was able to quickly whip these up. The claim is true, chewy and crispy along the edge. More cake like but not a dry cakey batter, it was moist. I used agave syrup instead of corn syrup. I added peanut butter chips and semi sweet chips to kick it up a notch. The taste is very similar to warm chocolate chip chewy bars. I'm thinking I'll melt in the semi sweet chips with the batter for more chocolate taste. Overall they were a hit. Bakes beautifully. And it was my first time.

These turned out just as described, "chewy in the middle and crisp on the outside edges." If you love chewey brownies these are for you! I HATE cake brownies so these were perfect for me. They compare quite nicely to box brownies, which from me is a compliment. I like to make things homemade though so this is my go to recipe for now! Oh the one change I did make was to drop the salt to 1/2 tsp. If you read the reviews you'll see the submitter said that 1 1/2 was a typo. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

After trying several brownie recipes from AR, these by far are everything I am looking for in a good brownie. I often add a layer of chocolate frosting with them. I lie mine warmed up a bit in the microwave for 10 sec, place in a bowl with a bit of milk poured with it. YUM!

My daughter loves to bake brownies and she had asked me to find her a recipe she could make herself. She made these the first time and we all absolutely loved them! She now makes these almost daily (and I am not exaggerating)Thank you so much for sharing the recipe. The brownies are very good and very easy to adjust to your liking. For example, adding chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, different kinds of nuts, etc. I definitely recommend this recipe!

Made these on the weekend figuring I'd have treats to add to lunches for the week. WRONG! They were gone by the end of the day; eaten by my very happy family of five! Followed the recipe as given and loved it.  This is a family favorite!

I love fudgy, chewy brownies but also love the crispy edges just as much... and these hit the mark. After reading other reviews, I used 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup flour and a little more cocoa powder than called for. I won't be using boxed brownie mixes again!

I ran out of brownie mix and didn't have time to go to the grocery store.  I knew I had the ingredients to make some from scratch and after reviewing many recipes I went with this one.  I love it!  It was super easy and cutting them was a breeze. I usually have to refrigerate my brownies in order to get clean cuts but these didn't need that at all. I think I'll pick up some mason jars or gallon size bags and mix up the dry ingredients to keep on hand when I need to make brownies rather than buying boxes to keep on hand.  Really nice recipe!  Thanks!!

This recipe is great! It doesn't taste like chocolate cake like so many other brownie recipies. It's for sure the best brownies I've ever made.

Oh my gosh! These are seriously the best brownies I have EVER had! I will make them this way from now on! I did add a little bit of shredded chocolate into my mix before I baked it and didn't do the nuts. I didn't even try the glaze, they don't need it! To die for! Thanks for sharing!

Made no changes and these were the perfect brownie. The whole batch was gone in a few hours. The kids were eating three at a time. This will be my official brownie recipe.

This was a great recipe. Just the way a brownie should be - Dense, and chewy. I did add just a bit more cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey, and I also added about a tablespoon of instant coffee powder because I find that it really brings out the chocolate flavour. But overall this was the best brownie recipe that I have found. Too many recipes make cake-like squares, and these were definitely not that. Thank you for the great recipe!

These were okay.  They tasted a little bland to me.  Even with extra sugar and cocoa, the flavor just wasn't there.

I loved this recipe!! I’ve been looking for a scratch recipe that mimics a boxed brownie in both flavor and texture... this totally nailed it for us! I’ve tried so many recipes with a great texture but wayyy too rich and almost bitter. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I had my favorite brownie mix, they stopped carrying it in my town, so I've been on a quest to make them homemade. I have tried dozens of brownie recipes. This one is perfect! I love that you don't have to make more dirty dishes by melting butter or chocolate.  I do use Hershey's special dark cocoa which makes a BIG difference but other than that,  I don't modify the recipe at all. It always turns out. (I have made it probably 20+ times) ?? Thank you for your perfect brownies! If anyone says otherwise, they are making it wrong!

This recipe delivers!  The thumbnail photo on the site is ugly, but the taste and texture are fantastic!  This is my most requested recipe!  I leave off the glaze and just sprinkle chocolate chips across the top to up the visual appeal.  Superb brownies!

I'm not sure what I did wrong (right?!?) but after following the recipe exactly, we didn't get the "chewy, crispy" brownie we were looking for. Instead, we got the PERFECT brownie!  Maybe my oven (cruddy electric) cooks differently or... I dunno what happened here. I rarely write reviews and when I do, I'm sure to make the recipe at least twice before leaving a review. I can't think of one bad thing about this recipe!

Not at all caky or crispy, chewy. Serendipitous, I suppose, but this recipe has replaced my go to recipe. For the chewy, crispy brownie, I'm using a vegan recipe. Since my family loves both types of brownies, I usually have to make two different recipes so we have both.

Thank you SO much!

This is the recipe I have spent my cocoa brownie-lovin' life searching for. I made a half recipe at first to see if it was good and reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup. I also used buckwheat flour, since I didn't have white flour and maple syrup instead of corn syrup, and added a good pinch of cinnamon along with vanilla, which I always do for chocolate desserts. Gives it an almost hazelnut taste. I baked them in a muffin tin for about 20-25 minutes at the indicated temperature and they came out just like those bite-sized brownies we all know and love from the store, minus the questionable ingredients. Will make again and again, maybe with a cream or goat cheese centre. Thanks for sharing, Tom!

Awesome. Baked it 3 times for family and friends. I just cut back the sugar to 1 cup instead as we eat it with ice cream.

I have been trying to find a made from scratch, "boxed" brownie mix for 10 years and this is it!! These brownies are amazing!!  (I did add in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips because I couldn't help it) but used the full egg amount.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

I halved the recipe just bc we really didn't need to have so much. I also used a muffin tin as well. I baked for about 15-20 mins.  I also added chocolate chips. Yummy!! They turned out perfect.

Made this recipe because I was having a chocolate craving, and didn't have much in the house. I needed a recipe that used oil because I didnt have butter. So, this fit the bill. They were great! I added some chocolate chips to the batter, omitted the walnuts. I only had 8x8 pans so I divided the batter and made two batches. Also, I didn't make the glaze, but they were delicious without it, crispy on the edges, warm and fudgy in the middle. Glad I tried it!

I've made this recipe many times and it's now my go-to brownie recipe.  With a bit of tweaking they make the perfect chewy edge and gooey inside brownies.  I make them with 1/4 cup of corn syrup (and occasionally an extra bit of cocoa) and bake them in a 9x9 pan.  In the smaller pan you must bake them an extra 15 minutes and let them cool completely for big chewy brownies. Delicious!

This recipe produced a rich chewy brownie that the whole family loved. I followed the recipe exactly(except omitted the nuts and added semi sweet chocolate chips instead) and they were delicious.  Tried it again but subbed out the oil with unsweetened applesauce and used whole wheat flour and they were still delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are super good.  I used shortening instead of vegetable oil, as that is what I had in the house.  I needed to bake them for 40 minutes but that may be due to high altitude.  I didn't make the icing.

These brownies were awesome! My friend and I made "Yummy Bars" With brownies on the bottom, Oreo in the middle, and cookies on the top. We didn't try the drizzle though. We thought it would be horrible on top of the cookies. They turned out fantastical

These are delicious!  I marbled them with the cream cheese, egg and sugar from the Marbled Brownie recipe and they are very tasty that way, also.  They do have a lovely crisp crust and chewy interior.

Used butter instead of oil and skipped the glaze. Baked for 28 minutes in metal pan. Delicious. Husband loves them, too. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I used this as a base for mini brownie bites and they were wonderful! 
I used a 3rd less sugar, added an extra table spoon of cocoa and crushed almonds as my nut. 
Had too add a spoon or two of milk to loosen it due to the extra cocoa but they came out the perfect combo of rich, light and moist. I also added an 1/8 cream of tartar to give them a fudgy center, divine!

Maybe my review shouldn't count because I altered the recipe to ingredients I had on hand. Still turned out great though. I didn't have any cocoa powder and used 6 oz of Scharffen Berger's 99% unsweetened cacao dark chocolate melted it slowly in the microwave and mixed half of the sugar with the chocolate and set aside to cool. Then whipped the eggs with the remaining sugar, vanilla and an unmeasured amount of extra virgin olive oil I would guess 2/3 cup. Mixed flour, salt and baking powder adding egg mixture to dry and adding in chocolate last with walnuts. Although a waste of good olive oil, olive flavor was not present. Brownies turned out great. The only thing I would change is adding large sea salt crystals as an alternative for salt to get the bite and crunch of great salt flavor.

I made some adjustments and they turned out marvelous! I used 1.5c white sugar and .5 c brown sugar. And I also used 1stick of unsalted butter along with 1/2 of a cup of oil. And I added 1/2 c dark choc chips and 1/2 c of marshmallows because i don't care for nuts. 

They were moist and chewy and a little crusty on the edges! Thanks for a great start for my new brownie recipe!

Once the salt is reduced (maybe that was a typo?), these brownies are awesome!  It's hard to find a brownie recipe that uses cocoa powder that's not too cakey.  These were perfectly chewy and delicious!  You could do any kind of nuts or none at all, mint extract, chocolate chips, etc.

Excellent! I halved the salt as others suggested, and did not make the glaze (as I like brownies without icing). These were so delicious! Perfectly cakey and fudgy at the same time and the crunchy edges were yummy too. To top it off, this was one of the easiest brownie recipes ever. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Oh man! I made these to bring to a friend’s house tomorrow and  at the rate we’re going, I might need to make another batch tomorrow morning. I cut a small square out to try because I couldn’t possibly bring a new recipe to someone’s house without ever tasting it! One small square was the gateway to many other. I have lost all self control and I blame the deliciousness of these brownies. I made the recipe exactly as it says. Definitely my new go-to recipe for brownies!!!

The edges were very nice crispy yummy chewy. No more boxed brownies for this family.

I put the batter in muffin tins. They didn't come out of the tins very well, so I will use cupcake liners if make them again. They weren't really moist or chewy, more crispy on the outside and pretty normal on the inside.  But they tasted good and they are fast and easy to make.

I use this recipe all the time. It’s never failed me other than boyom burning in oven. Gotta cook it at low temp like 320 for 20-25 min. No longer then that. Also the corn syrup is NOT a required ingredient. It’s optional. It works with or without it. I’ve made it both ways. And it works out amazing it’s my favorite recipe.  I’d mix together wet ingredients in one bowl and dry in another bowl then mix all together. Chocolate chips and pecans go great in this recipe as well

These were so-so. Really not as deep and dark chocolate-y like I like  AND considering that the recipe describes them as chewy and moist, wow, was I disappointed!! This makes a great cake but no way were they ' chewy brownies'! Sorry.  I'all keep looking for a great 'CHEWY' brownie recipe!

There's way too much egg! And it didn't turn out chewy.  Disappointed.

This is a great basic chewy brownie recipe!  Nothing super fancy but definitely a step up from anything you make out of the box. I cut back the sugar by a quarter cup, substituted hazel nut extract for the the vanilla, and threw in some marshmallows instead of nuts. Turned out moist and chewy. I plan to use the brownies in a chocolate trifle. Yum!

I used half butter and half vegetable oil, used 3 tablespoons honey rather than corn syrup, increased cocoa powder by 3 tablespoons. Required 10 extra minutes cooking time.  Turned out deliciuos with rich chocolate flavor, a little crisp outside, fudgy inside. Yum

Good recipe, a touch bitter for my taste so the 2nd time through I added 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup oil and a few drops of water, at high altitude bake time will be closer to 40 minutes.

I have made this brownie recipe multiple times and every one always loves them! The only changes I made is that I use self rising flour ( thus eliminating the salt and baking powder) and sometimes I don't put nuts in the recipe or use pecans instead. Also, I rarely put the glaze on top. It makes them too sweet. I made these for a Christmas party tonight and everyone thought  I had gotten them from a bakery. Great recipe!

Followed the recipe and it came out cake-like. I was looking for a chewy fudge like brownie. 
The only thing I changed was 1 cup oil to 1/2c and added 1/2c applesauce.
I also added chocolate chips, no nuts.

I'm so sad. I've been craving good chewy brownies for a solid week. I made these exactly by the recipe (omitting the glaze) but cooked them in a muffin pan for 22 minutes. They were very cakey and not chewy at all. I will try again but use butter in place of oil and my 9 x 13 pan next time.

OMG!! Finally found the perfect chewy recipe! I've tried everything but this is it! My daughter & I make this frequently!! I like mine a little "overcooked" for the chewy edges so I go 30+ minutes @ 350! Thanks for the recipe!

I made half a recipe (with an extra half egg) and they turned out very yummy and moist. These were not very dense, something that I like in brownies.  Crisp  on the outside and soft inside. My hubby and me finished an 8" x 8" in two days. Will make again

I will first tell you I live in a high altitude area. I am always concerned about moisture levels. Like other reviewers I added 3/4 butter but kept the oil, added choc chips instead of nuts, tsp instant coffee and hot water to dissolve the coffee in the amount to replace the corn syrup that I did not have and replaced a 1/4 c of the flour with cocoa. I cooked it 20 extra minutes and it was still wet in the middle. They were delicious but very rich. Next time, I will omit the oil and the chips and see what the instant coffee alone does. Thank you for the very yummy recipie.

I have made these several times and love the recipe.  The only change that I made was to add 2 tablespoons of molasses instead of corn syrup.  It adds a little mellow flavor.   Then I melt chocolate chips with sweetened condensed  milk and put on top.  Talk about chocolate overload!  Great recipe.  Always a hit at church get togethers

With a few tweaks, these are great. First, I added an ounce of unsweetened chocolate, melted to 1/4 c butter, and 1/4 oil. I also added a tbs of cornstarch to the flour. Yes unexpected, but it gives it a nice chew. It makes it similar to cake flour. Last, stir in some semi sweet chips. Not many, I eyeballed it, 1/4 to 1/2 cup. They were great.

It was fun doing this recipe. The brownies were chewy after it cooled off, that's what I like. However, the next day the brownies were extremely hard. That I did NOT like. Overall, it was a good recipe to use in learning to make brownies from scratch.

Best brownies so chewy and moist.  Make sure you do not over mix the batter

I have read the previous reviews and disagree that these brownies are chewy.  They are more like a light-chocolate cake with walnuts.  I have not been able to find a brownie recipe that can compare to the box kind. If anyone knows of one, please post it, in the meantime, I'll just keep buying the DH brand since it's the best.
I enjoy reading the reviews and am always amused that people take a recipe and add/subract ingredients to make their own recipe - why not just enter your own recipe in the first place?

Ok I made them with the oil and honestly I didn't love the flavor., it was as though I could taste the oil. I'd like to re-do them with butter instead to see if it helps. The texture was exactly what I wanted though, so that was a plus.

Reduced salt to 1/2 tsp. Used all room temperature ingredients, and my 13x9 pan was done at 22 minutes. Delicious!!

AWESOME! Nice and chewy, especially around the edges. I can finally stop looking for a recipe that pleases both me and my husband!

I loved the texture and will make again. It was Way too sweet and I love everything sweet. So next time I will cut back on the sugar. I also used 1/2 teaspoon salt as others suggested and it was fine.

Not a lot of flavor - I guess that is because of the oil instead of butter. Maybe using some brown sugar instead of so much white would help. Or add more vanilla? Still - it was a good, easy recipe.
