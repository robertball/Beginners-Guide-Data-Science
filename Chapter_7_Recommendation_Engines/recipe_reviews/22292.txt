This is my standard pot pie recipe for chicken or turkey...the only difference is that I use a can of cream of potato soup instead of mushroom or cream of chicken.  Also, make sure you use a can vegetable mix that includes potatoes.  Use more or less milk to make a nice creamy mixture.  My family requests this often, and with refrigerator pie crusts this is a real time saving version of the traditional comfort food.

Very easy, very yummy recipe.  Comfort food at its best.  I used more than a cup of chopped turkey (probably closer to 2 cups).  I also added some fresh parsley (chopped) and some shredded mozzerella cheese, just because I had them on hand and wanted to use them up.  I also put a little salt and pepper in the filling mixture.  It took a little longer to cook due to having a larger amount of the filling.  The results were delicious.  I will definitely be making this pot pie often.  I think next time I will try it with chopped chicken.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe Candy.

I used regular cream of mushroom soup and some leftover "frozen vegetables" and it turned out excellent.  Because it was a little hard to slice into pieces, I think that I will make it in a casserole dish next time with just one pie crust on top.  Very Good!!!

This was excellent, however I made a few changes. I used cream of potato soup instead of mushroom. I used thawed frozen vegetables. I also cut up some fresh mushrooms and onions and sauted them along with the thawed vegetables in salt, pepper and garlic. I then added them to the liquid mixture and placed in pie shell.

Hearty, home-cooked, comfort meal. Creamy and thick. I used a rotisserie chicken from my deli and shredded it into the filling. I also used a frozen 9-inch pie crust along with a refrigerated roll pie crust for the top. Yum.

I have made pot pies before, never found one that is so easy and taste so good, this one is perfect.  The changes I made is using cream of potatoe soup instead of cream of golden mushroom...don't care for it...I added 1 can of cream of chicken...I used 2 cups of turkey...I used 2 can of mixed vegetables...I used double the milk...I added dash of salt, pepper, garlic, dried parsley, and poultry seasoning.  I also added a little diced onions.  My husband and kids wont eat the store bought ones.  They told me they would never eat it again...They were surprised when I made this...They said only make this from now on...there excited to try this recipe with chicken and beef.

Really easy and delicious! I actually put my pie crust in a cassarole dish so it was a "deep dish" pot pie. I put mashed potatoes on the botom and put the mixture on top of that. Then I did a lattice top so I could ensure it wouldn't come out doughy... DELICOUS!

I used this and the reviews as a base recipe and our family really enjoyed the outcome and it was easy to make.  What I did was use 24 oz of frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrots and beans), put them in a 9 x 13 glass dish and added approximately 1 cup of diced fresh onions and thawed the veggies in the microwave (this partially cooked the onions).  I drained the thawed veggies and then layered on top of them about 2 cups of chopped turkey (enough to cover).  Then I mixed 1 can of golden mushroom soup, 1 can crm of potato soup, approx 1/2 c fresh diced parsley, 1 tsp white pepper and 1 c milk and poured it over the turkey.  Then I covered with two pie crusts and baked at 400 for 1 hr.  Next time I'll try for only 50 minutes as 1 hour was a little long for the crust.

Comfort food! I used what I had (leftover chicken, cream of chicken soup, can of Veg-All, refrigerated roll out pie crust) Delicious and so very easy.  Perfect after an exhausting day of work.  Pop it in the oven and then relax for 45 minutes. It tasted like much more work went into it. Would definitely make again and again.

I love turkey pot pie and I decided to make this recipe because of the rave reviews. This recipe needs something more than just a turkey and soup taste and that is what this recipe is, "A soup and turkey pot pie"  It was VERY bland. This recipe is missing spices. I will make it again; however, it needs some garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, poultry seasoning, and a little bit of seasoning salt. I am going to keep an eye on the reviews because I would be interested to see what other seasonings others suggest.

This turkey pot pie turned out tasting  good! But, I a few adjustments to it...to make it more filling and tasty. 1) I added some seasoned cubed hashbrowns (fozen type, which I cooked ahead of time and then added it). 2) I added fz peas/corn (not mixed veggies; think its too much)to it. These additions,I think...added more heartness to the pie. The pie filling, seemed like it was missing some stuff. Okay, maybe, I just personally prefer MY meat pies to have potatoes and some simple veggies. This is a great recipe, if you and/ or those you know, want to make a meat pot pie that is easy, but is moist, hearty, with a good, home-made-like taste to it.

I enjoyed this recipe. It was a week after Christmas and I didn't know what to cook for supper. I found this recipe to be very simple, cheap and easy to make. We're a family of 5 so I had to double the recipe and we loved it!  My husband is not a turkey fan, but he said he would cook a turkey more often just to have this recipe made again!

Very good and easy recipe. I modified slightly...added some potatoes (boiled before adding)  and added paprika, poultry seasoning, and parsley (1 tsp each)  to the sauce. It was a great way to finish off leftover turkey from the holidays.

I picked this recipe because I wanted to use the leftover turkey but didn't want to have to go out and buy a lot of additional ingredients.  This was perfect. I added a little more turkey and vegetable to make the pie a little more filling.  I also brushed the top of the pie with a beaten egg to give it a rich golden color.

Very good and so easy to make!  I didn't have a can of vegetables, so I used some frozen peas and carrots instead and I had a bit of leftover gravy and mashed potatoes so I threw them in as well.  Delicious!

This is great.  I followed other suggestions and used cream of potato soup and a generic version of Veg-All.  This is so easy to make that aside from the putting the crusts on, my 6-year old made the whole thing.  She even crimped the edges of the crust.  My husband is not a fan of store-bought pot pies and was very impressed and wants to serve it at our next potluck.

Yummy. I've made pot pies before but they always seemed to be too juicy. I used deep dish pie crusts, but I don't know if it mattered. I like crust. I added an onion (because I love onion), some garlic and used Veg-All. I thought about adding two cans because I love that vegetable flavor - glad I didn't. At the request of my son I added a little shredded cheese.  Good but would have been fine without it. This would work well with canned chicken, or even leftover roast.
I liked the leftovers. My husband didn't.

Just as others suggested, I added more turkey (about 1-3/4 total) and some spices.  It turned out excellent!  I'm not big on pot pies, but this was delicious....and so easy to make.  I will definitely make it again and again.

Delicious! I added the rest of our leftover gravy from thanksgiving (about a cup) and probably used more like 2 or 2.5 cups of Turkey. So simple and so yummy! I used a 15 oz can of veggies, drained. I even froze the rest of my leftover Turkey so I can make this again in a few months :)

I used this recipe after thanksgiving with left over turkey and it was delicious.  I used cream of onion soup instead of mushroom and it added much more flavor.  I'm making it tonight with chopped up rotisserie chicken.

Pretty good.  I didnt care for the pie crust too much...I used two and it was a lot of carbs.  I did had southern frozen potatoes (cooked first in skillet) and it made a huge difference!  My favorite part!  Worth making for something different!

This was really good.  Had a good texture and not really soupy.  I used my old standby pie crust recipe and leftover turkey with fresh vegetables(onion, yellow bell pepper, celery, cubed potatoes and garlic, etc., just whatever I had on hand, sauteed in butter.  I also added 2 tsps paprika and some sage.  I think next time I will try adding a finely minced jalapeno for some zip.  I served it with the leftover cranberry relish.  Will definitely make this again.

Turned out very good.  I used cream of potato soup and put a handful of grated cheddar cheese in along with the milk, frozen veggies, and chopped turkey.  Next time I would put more turkey in, I don't think 1 cup is enough.

This was great!  I used several of the variations - cream of potato soup and frozen veggies that I thawed slightly in the microwave.  I used leftover turkey gravy for more liquid and slightly thawed has brown potatoes!

I had always wanted to make a home made turkey pot pie !! Now I have. Very pleased with the results. I loved the simplicity of the recipe. Might try a different cream soup next time. Will make again often with turkey leftovers or chicken !!

Excellent way to use up that left over turkey!  I did make modifications.  I used 2 cups of turkey, 1 can Cream of Chicken & Mushroom soup in lieu of mushroom soup and added 1/4 tsp of thyme and 1/4 tsp of black pepper.  Kept milk the same.  Baked @ 375 degrees, on lower rack, for 50-60 minutes or until crust is golden brown.   Great taste and very creamy.  Will def make this again.

Very good! Since I saw folks using whatever soup they liked, I decided to use some leftover homemade clam chowder. It's so much like potato soup anyway, and it turned out to be a great choice! I added no milk and used some cornstarch diluted in chicken broth to thicken up the soup/filling. Delicious! Although I prefer not to use canned soups, sometimes it's just easier, so next time I want pot pie and don't have homemade soup, I'll just grab a can of potato soup. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

This is great. I used 2 shallots instead of onions and 1/2 cup sliced button mushrooms sauted together, then added to the pan a can of cream of potato soup, 1 cup frozen vegetables, about 1/3 cup milk, 1 1/2 cups shredded turkey. Once it was all heated through I put it all in a casserole dish, topped it with pie crust and put it in the oven. The pie crust was finicky and I started it at 400F for 15 minutes, then 350F for 45 minutes. Every last crumb was eaten up, no leftovers! This is a great way to finish off the turkey!

this recipe is easy to follow and customize to your tastes and supplies: I went all-leftovers! I used half cream of mushroom soup and half cream of chicken soup. Also, I used half and half instead of milk. Instead of the mixed vegetables, I stirred in some of our leftover green bean casserole, and a handful of frozen corn niblets. YUM!

Wow- this recipe is unbelievably easy and the taste is AMAZING! I used condensed cream of potato soup instead and was very happy with the results. I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top before I topped the filling with the second pie shell. Yum! Prep time was more like 5 min- which was fine by me! I will definitely use this recipe again and also try subbing chicken too.

This was very good.  I bought Pilsbury pie shells for the crusts.  I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of Mushroom (but the was a personal preference).  I cubed up a large potato and microwaved it for 2 minutes.  I also cut up a quarter of a cup of baby carrots and that was the only vegetables I put in (I would have liked more, but hubby only like carrots).  I probably added closer to 1 1/2 cups a turkey, which was good.

On the effort vs. taste curve this is very high.  It's simple, and delicious!  Like everyone else I added my own twist to it with some corn and a bit more milk and a few other things, but the process is simple and the taste is fabulous.  I've made it twice in the last two weeks.

I will deffinately use this again for left over turkey.  It would also be great for left over roast chicken.  I used the healthy request cream of mushroom, instead of the golden mushroom, and it was great.

This was so easy! It's not the best pot pie I've ever had in my life, but considering how easy it was and tasted good, it gets 5 stars. For the last 20 minutes of cooking I baked at 350 degrees(because I made biscuits too) and it still cooked perfectly!

Added a potato (diced and microwaved) and frozen veggies, probably two cups of veggies and two cups of turkey, but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out great. My husband was soooooo happy to have "homemade" pot pie, as he called it. This recipe could be modified with beef or chicken, but is great as is. Easy as pie. : )

This recipe is really great. I have been using just a top crust the last several times to try and save some calories. It still is very good. I use cream of potato soup instead of golden mushroom and used diced canned potatoes, green beans, corn, and carrots for the veggies (husband doesn't like peas.)I also added 1 cup cheddar cheese this last time. Great as leftovers too!

This was very good AND easy!!! I used cream of mushroom soup but any will do. Also added a handful of shredded cheese to thicken a bit, a small can of mushroom slices and some pepper and garlic. I used the deep dish pie shells that come frozen 2 to a pack and defrosted the top according to the package directions. It fell apart a bit  but it was all good in the end! My hubby had 2 pieces! I divided the pie into 4 pieces. Great with a salad for a work night dinner!

I'm not a fan of the golden mushroom soup by itself.  However, I followed this recipe and found the soup added a delicious, hearty flavor.  I used frozen peas, fresh onion, and fresh carrots, which I slightly cooked before adding to the mix.  I also added some cubed potatoes.

I made this recipe in a double-batch.  The first batch I made a traditional pie and the second batch I made individual pies using puff pastry and they were both really tasty.  The only thing I did differently was use half and half instead of milk to make it really creamy and I sauteed some onions in butter and added it to the mix.  Overall, a very good recipe.

This will be my go-to recipe for leftover turkey. It was a HUGE hit. I cooked diced fresh and frozen vegetables (carrot, potato, green peas, corn, zucchini, and eggplant) and added Italian seasoning and black pepper, as well as a handful of shredded cheese. My pie shells were store bought. I didn't change much and I'm pleased with the recipe. It was quite easy to follow.

I used a can of cream of potato soup and added a dash of pepper, a dash of salt, 1/2 tbsp of sugar, a dash of onion powder and a small dash of garlic powder. And my goodness, it was delicious!! I covered with aluminum foil for the first 30 minutes of cooking, then uncovered it for another 30 minutes until it turned golden. Even my husband (who is sick of turkey 2 days after thanksgiving) LOVES it!!

Made as directed and way too salty.  Used left over Thanksgiving turkey which was not salty so must have been the soup? If less salty, would have added another star. Won't make again, sorry.

I doubled it to make 2 pies.  I did cream of mushroom soup (one full fat, on 98% fat free).  The pies were very very liquidy- I assume from the fat free soup.  You need to use full fat soup for this to work out right.

I made this last night. I gave it 5 stars because my picky husband loved it, as did I. I doubled the turkey, used cream of potato, cream of chicken and cream of mushroom, veg-all and a can of sliced potatoes that I diced. I added seasoning of garlic, poultry season, minced dry onion, splash of worchestershire sauce, chopped parsley, season salt, pepper blend. I used about 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cheddar cheese and about 1/3 cup of leftover turkey brown gravy. I baked in large casserole dish with only the top crust. My oven is old and finicky so the next time I make this, I will place a ring of foil over the outer edge of the crust to prevent over-browning while the center of the crust browns more. My mixture made a large casserole. The next time I make this, I will not add extra cans, I will bake in pie plate and use the top and bottom crust - at my husband's request.

I loved this!  I used a 16oz can of Veg-All and my boyfriend's feedback was that the 1 can of mushroom soup wasn't enough gravy so next time I will try to change that a bit.  I added a little salt and pepper and it was awesome in my book!

The flavors in this recipes are awesome.  I did add potatoes, parsley, and carrots to the frozen veggies.  I used phyllo dough like another reviewer recommended, and it did not work for me.   I think the dough is too light for the rest of the pot pie mixture.  Next time I'll use the pie crust instead!  Excellent and easy recipe!

This was so easy and so good. I threw in a few leftover extra veggies we had in the fridge along with some from the can. Next time I think I will add a little more milk to make it a little more creamy. I did add extra veggies and turkey, why not???

This was very tasty and easy! I love short cut recipes however I like to make my mushroom mixture from scratch because the canned stuff has MSG in it. So, I just made a basic white sauce with sauted mushrooms, onion and a little red bell pepper. A little more work, but soooo good.

We didn't care for it to much. Could only really taste the turkey. It seemed to be missing something.

We made this according to the recipe and enjoyed it. I might suggest slightly more soup for the recipe to have a little more when you're eating it, but it's great as is, too!

This was a great base recipe.  I used what every can of cream soup I had (celery) and fresh onion, frozen mixed veggies and as someone had suggested frozen loose hash brown potatoes.  Will definately make again....

What a great recipe!  My family loved it and it got rid of the left over turkey. I added another can of soup and the same amont of milk and it was great. Everyone was asking for seconds!

I made this pot pie today using my Thanksgiving day leftovers and it was a big hit at my house. I'm making this a tradition.

very good and easy to make.  I use a flaky crust too.  that was awesome.  My husband liked the pot pie.  It was nice and warm after putting up Christmas lights in 34 degree weather.

Yum!  How easy and tasty!  The only thing I did was add a little more turkey because I had lots, and it was perfect.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for such a great recipe!
