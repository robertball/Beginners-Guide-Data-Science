This was easy and the chicken crisped up nicely and was juicy. The side got a little over cooked, which made the Brussels a little bitter and the apple was mushy and tasteless. The pancetta was also a little too crispy. I didn’t leave the side in the oven as long as the chicken. I took it out after 30 minutes but probably should have taken it out after 20. I like the concept. Perhaps another time I’ll start the meat first and add the side at the half way mark.

I hate brussel sprouts, but I had some and this recipe changed my opinion of them! I recommend using a tart-juicy apple like Granny Smith or Honey Crisp. Add the vegetable-fruit after the chicken has cooked for half the time. Yum!

Easy enough to make, but I found the flavor a little bland - it needed some  acid.  I will probably make again, but will drizzle some balsamic over it and increase the seasoning.

425°  is way to hot for 40 mins.  Everything  besides the chicken burned.  I made it last week but remembered I took it out early and was fine.

Awesome recipe. On a brussel sprouts kick right now. I added some more veggies, and 4 sliced jalepenos for a little kick. Thanks.

I added small red potatoes to the vegetables and used herbs de provence for seasoning, along with the salt & pepper. Excellent flavor and ever so easy!

So easy. So good. I added whole cloves of garlic into the mix, as well.

This is oh so good, quick and easy. I didn't have pancetta but the dish was great without it. I also used some spicy spices on the chicken!

Delicious quick family dinner.  My teenagers devoured this meal.  It was so easy!  I used bacon instead of pancetta and dried rosemary instead of fresh.  Still amazing!

This was easy, just like the directions said. It was very tasty, the whole family liked it and that doesn't happen often.  I will make it again, but I think I will use bacon instead of the pancetta.
