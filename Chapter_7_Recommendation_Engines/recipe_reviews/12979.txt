So good.  Per the suggestions of others I wanted to add a whole grain with the lentils.  I threw in about a half cup of dry rinsed quinoa -wonder food!!  I also 2x the spices and garlic, reduced the oil to 1-2 tsp, and because I like a heartier soup, I added 1 sweet potato, cubed and then roughly mashed to the consistency I wanted.  This soup was sooo good, and so good for you.  A perfect meal.  Enjoy.

Don't make the mistake I did: I added extra apricots on the second try and the soup was far too sweet.

Made this soup tonight and it was awesome.  i've been into experimenting with moroccan flavors and recipes lately and this soup, with it's slightly sweet and very rich flavor definately has a moroccan influence.

The modifications I made included using regular instead of red lentils, doubled up on the cumin as suggested by another reviewer, and I added an extra tomato.

I also added the spices and tomato to the onion and garlic saute and sauteed until it started to stick.  Then I de-glazed with a touch of red wine and added all the liquid and lentils. This sped up the cooking time a bit though I ended up letting it simmer for a couple hours because I had the time.

Next time I will double the recipe because my girlfriend and I plowed through almost the whole recipe all by ourselves!

This is a very good soup.  Different but in a good way.  I didn't think pureeing half at the end was necessary.  Also I didn't seed or peel the tomatoes.  Just diced them up and added to the soup.  I also used non stick spray and "sweated" the onions, garlic and apricot to cut most of the fat out of it.  I will definately make this soup again.

5 stars +!!!!! Excellent soup!!!! The only thing I changed was I used canned diced tomatoes (19oz) instead of fresh ones.  I can't wait to make this for company.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Really good.  I needed more liquid in it because the lentils soaked all the water up.  Put over double the amount of spices in it and added some cayenne pepper to it for some spice!  Served with brown rice because lentils aren't a full protein without a whole grain.

This is great! I love the lentil-apricot combo. Next time though, I think I might chop up the apricots a little more so I can have them more dispersed throughout the soup. I served this with the Blueberry Cornmeal muffins also on this website, and I thought the two recipes went well together. Added a 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper and a couple shakes extra of the cumin and thyme. As leftovers, this soup is delicious with some shredded cheddar cheese sprinkled on top! Thanks for the recipe!

After getting over my fears of lentils and apricots together... I decided to trust the good ratings and reviews and tried this recipe myself... I'm so glad I did.  I made it for family and everyone, including my picky-eater niece & nephew loved it.  I took other reviews advice and served it with rice, which was tasty, but it didn't need it, this soup was super filling all by itself.  I didn't puree the soup as I like more of a chunky stew texture, and I didn't peel the tomatoes before chopping either, but it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again!

This is probably my favorite soup.  It's a recipe I've made over and over again.  It's filling and unique.  This recipe makes exactly enough for four people as a main course, but make more if they're a hungry four people.  It's a must try!

I would give this recipe SIX stars if I could!  I have been giddy ever since we sat down to dinner.  We almost went out to eat tonight, and we were all so glad we stayed home and tried out this recipe.  The sweetness of the apricot blended with the savories was just heavenly.  I added a cubed sweet potato as another reviewer recommended, and the heartiness was perfect for this cold and crisp day.  Love, love, love!

We love this recipe; especially for when our gluten-free friends come over for dinner.  I add one or two sweet potatoes (cubed) to add heartiness, and I double the spices and garlic as other reviewers stated.

This recipe was fabulous with some tweaking. I increased the apricots to 1/2 cup, diced, used 1/2 cup red lentils and the rest regular brown to make 2 cups, plus added 1/2 tsp. each of curry pwdr, cardomom, and ground coriander. Because we are vegan, I used 6 cups vegetarian chick'n broth (to compensate for the additional lentils), and then cooked it in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes. After that, I stirred in the lemon juice, and 1 can of diced tomatoes NOT drained, and added salt, and 1 tsp. sugar. PERFECT! What a review it received from my out of town guests! My husband asked if we could have it once a week from now on. I highly recommend giving this soup a try, especially if you have a pressure cooker-the flavor is deep and throughout.

This soup was awesome.  The only issue we had was hubby added a little more apricot than it called for an it was a little too sweet.  Not the recipes' fault.

Really interesting concept!  I skipped the spices and added ginger, carrots, and curry powder instead.  Definitely go lighter rather than heavier on the apricots---a little bit goes a long way.  Spinach, raisins, and/or almonds would give this a more attractive color, I think.

I love this dish. I've made it exactly following the recipe and another time I made it with pre-cooked lentils that I had. Both times it was very good. I love it served with grilled cheese smeared with sweet chutney or toasted bread with apricot preserves. Yum!

This is such a versatile, tasty recipe. I couldn't find dried apricots, so I used dried mangos instead...it turned out great! I also wanted to use up some leftover pinto beans, so I subbed 2 cups of those for the lentils. I made mine a bit more asian, so I used a 1/2 cup OJ, mandarian seasoning, ginger, and added some extra garlic. I used 1 15oz. can diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and added in some leftover wheat rotini that I had to make it a bit more hearty. I also added 1 tsp crushed red pepper to spice things up a bit. Thanks for the idea to use dried fruit in a soup!

WOW-EE!  If I could give 10 stars, I would.  Looking at the ingredients, I had a feeling I would love this and the end result didn't disappoint.  My only regret was that I didn't make a double batch.  I used veg stock since I'm vegetarian and subbed undrained, diced tomatoes for the Roma's.  Amount of cumin was doubled and ample amounts of curry powder and cayenne pepper were added. This is fabulous!

It took me a while to come around to this soup, but after a few bowls and a couple of days in the fridge its flavor has melded and I'm really liking it. Part of the initial issue was due to the canned tomatoes which left a tinny top note that thankfully went away. I also think I'd have preferred vegetable broth in it for a purer vegetable essence (and this is coming from the consummate carnivore). In addition to the canned tomatoes I followed advice to add curry powder and sweet potato. I didn't find the apricots too sweet. Maybe some people are using sweetened apricots and that accounts for the issue.

Love it!  Original recipe only yields 3 servings for our family.  Needs the spices doubled.  Needs more stock because the lentils sucked up the liquid pretty good.  I used half a can of peeled & diced tomatoes instead of 3 roma or one regular tomato works fine too.   Delicious- this will be on the rotation.

I've made this recipe so many times - I can't believe I haven't reviewed it.  Many people have asked for the recipe.  It's absolutely wonderful.  We often have it with rice - to round out the protein.  We also like to sprinkle a bit of hot sauce on it - even the kids.  One time I made it with sweet potatoes, instead of apricots.

This soup was lucious! It is now one of our favorites! I did not have fresh tomatoes so I added a 15 oz. can of plain diced roma tomatoes which I had drained. I also did not blend any of the soup. I like the lumpy texture, although it was still pretty smooth. One thing that helped was I used my own homemade broth made from the carcass of a whole fowl after I removed most of the meat. I think this adds more flavor rather than using canned broth. This is a somewhat pricey soup with the apricots and everything but well worth it.

YUM!  I think that I boiled the lentils a bit to long because the puree part wasn't necessary and I didn't have any whole lentils in it. I didn't peel or seed the tomatoes and threw in some chopped green peppers for color.  It was still delicious. Thanks for sharing.

This was good! my husband and 12 month old liked it. It was a nice twist to have soup that was a little sweet. I used canned tomatoes and chicken bouillon - very good.

This has been awesome both times I've made it, getting rave reviews from my friends.  I've doubled the amount of cumin & consider the tomatoes optional.  I also add everything except the lemon (also double the lemon) up front, and this seems to help cut down the cooking time.

Really good flavor! Used a can of diced tomatoes, 2 cups of green lentils (8oz bag), double cumin, and 2 more cups of broth. Also did not puree at the end. Definitely will try next time paired with brown rice.

i have never given anything 5 stars but this came very close to being the first!! i didnt change a thing even after reading the reviews of at least 20 helpful gr8 people who were nice enuf to leave their helpful hints and this was amazing!! i had to fight myself to keep from doubling the spice as so many had suggested but wanted to see how it was first as it was submitted, my sweetheart isnt as fond of this style food as i, so i figured if it lacked i could always add the next day because i was making this a day ahead of eating it anyway. i did double the recipe as i had promised some taste testing at the office ahead of making it!! lol!! i loved it without the extra spices and in no way found this to be bland or boring!! i did find i had to add only 1 cup additional broth (which since we are vegetarians i used veggie broth)in cooking and that is between the double recipes as it got too thick the last 15 min of cooking and i like very thick soup! i was just a little afraid it would scorch so i added the cup of broth to be safe. there was no need to blend the soup, the lentils broke down nicely and it was nice and creamy when cooking was complete. i did peel and seed my tomatoes and really think the fresh peeled an seeded tomatoes are worth the little extra tinme it takes so come people dont be so hurried spoil urselves!! i found the red lentils at whole foods market and they were worth the drive!! this is an awesome soup and next time i will try with the cubed sweet potato an

This was really good.  Loved the hint of apricot in it.  I will also add that I can only eat about a half bowl.  It's quite odd, but I become extremly full, and it stays with me for hours.  Low fat, delicious,nutritious and filling.  What more could you ask for.  I would call this a one pot wonder, and I rarely say that about a dish.  Thank you for sharing this.

This soup is the most delicious lentil soup I have ever had! I was looking for a recipe that was like a healthy canned soup (used to be "Too Good to Be True" by President's Choice) that is no longer made and this one is like it, but even more delicious. The canned one had a tang to it because it had lime juice, so I think next time I will try lime instead of lemon - but it still was wonderful as it is.

Nice combination of flavours, love the sweet and tangy harmony of it. Doubled the apricot and used regular lentils because I had them on hand. I'm sure the red ones would make for nicer presentation so I'll try them next time. Served this soup with some toasted cheese & mango chutney sandwiches - a killer combo!

This is the best! My husband took one bite and said YUM. Based on other reviews I used a can of diced tomatoes (with juice)instead of fresh, doubled the spices and added a few shakes of cayenne pepper. Also I didn't have chicken stock so I used 2 chicken buillion cubes. And I used regular lentils instead of red, which took longer to cook, over an hour simmering, and I had to add a bit more water-I filled the tomato can with water and that was enough. I chopped the dried apricots and didn't use any salt since the buillion is pretty salty, and didn't blend it at all. Sounds like a lot of changes but its not, its very easy to make and seriously one the best soups I've ever had. Thanks!

Good & unusual flavor.  Made a day ahead for a holiday get-together and everyone loved it. Used veggie broth rather than chicken and canned tomatoes.  Added a lot more cumin & thyme than recipe called for!  Thanks.

Thank you, Karena, for this wonderful recipe.  It is so unusual, I wasn't sure my family would like it, but everyone practically cheers when I serve it!  The color and taste are special.  I always double the recipe, and instead of peeling tomatoes, I just add a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  This freezes well too.

I came across this recipe in my ongoing quest to find foods for someone on a pureed diet.  Potato, cream, and cheese based soups were getting a bit old, and pureed bean in general doesn't really need to be soup.  This one seemed different without being off the rails.  SUCCESS!  Another soup to add to the arsenal.  I was worried about the apricot, but read the reviews and was careful not to add too much.  Since the recipe doesn't say what to do with the apricot, I diced them fairly small, and measured that way.  The taste was very slight, but enough to give it character.  I didn't peel the tomatoes either.  Only one tablespoon of lemon, and I thought it was way more than enough.  Red lentils are kind of important as they break down better.  Found them at Sprouts whole foods.  I used a stick blender to puree the whole batch, and it made a wonderfully thick, tasty soup, perfect for what I was looking for.  Good protein and fiber are a bonus!

I fond this very bland.  The apricots added nothing to the flavor and it was so thick it was more like a stew than a soup.  Threw it out.

This was good!  I have to say I disagree with those who said increasing the amount of apricots made it too sweet.  I only used the 1/3 cup (finely chopped) apricots that the recipe called for, and I could barely taste any apricot/sweetness at all in the finished product.  Next time I will definitely increase to 1/2 cup at least.
That said, the soup was super delicious!  I doubled the thyme and cumin (as suggested by many reviewers), and I'm glad I did.  Perfect blend of spices!

I LOVE this soup!  It's easy to convert to vegetarian; just sub veggie broth for the chicken broth.  The flavor does not suffer for the substitution.  My only suggestion/recommendation would be to finely chop the apricots before adding; you don't want big chunks of them in the soup. (Use a greased knife or oiled scissors for this.)  DO NOT omit the lemon juice; it adds a very important flavor dimension.  Thank you, Karena, for a terrific recipe!

I made this recipe because I had dried apricots that I wanted to use up.  I wasn't expecting this soup to be so outstanding!  I followed the recipe but used green lentils instead of red just because I couldn't find them.  I will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked the soup in a pressure cooker. (I grew up in India and we always cook lentils in a pressure cooker.) I made this ahead of time for a dinner party at my house. When it was time to serve, the soup had thickened to large lump. I diluted with chicken broth. I had four guests and they all agreeed that this soup was the bomb. It was really yummy. Cannot wait to make it again.       However, if you plan to make it ahead of time, you may want to reduce the lentils to one cup.

I love this recipe!  The trick the soup is to COVER the stock pot and then let the soup simmer 30 minutes, so that way the water stays in the pot, it won't boil out and leave you needing to add more water.  I pureed the soup completely with a stick blender, and then right before serving, I swirled in a dollop of plain yogurt for some extra creaminess.  It was awesome!  Thanks for the great, inexpensive, recipe!

This was a delicious and hearty soup that we both enjoyed.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of replacing raw garlic with 4 cloves of roasted garlic.  I also chopped the apricots prior to sauteing.  This soup is a wonderful alternative to the lentil soup I'm used to with it's slightly fruity taste.    I served it with the Homesteader Cornbread recipe I found on this sight and we will definitely be having this duo again.

Honestly, this was my first attempt at ANY soup. I was looking for something high in fiber that I could freeze (I'm a college student). I love it!
I took the advice of others and used diced tomatoes, as well as added more cumin. Also, I put in some paprika. It is awesome. You can't really taste the apricots per say, but it is definitely good.

Don't skip this because of the ingredient list!  It was delicious and the apricots cook down, adding a slight sweetness to the broth, with the consistency of a cooked yellow pepper.  It was different flavors than I usually serve, but my family thought it was definitely one to try again.

Yes! This is a simple, hearty, flavorful soup that's healthy and a snap to throw together. I did not puree the soup, which didn't matter since it was already creamy from simmering. I chopped the apricots before adding them, and I used two large tomatoes instead of the Romas called for. That was a mistake, as the Romas would have had a better flavor. Next time -- and there _will_ be a next time -- I'll probably add a can of chopped tomatoes as so many have suggested here. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really easy and really good. I doubled the cumin and thyme, and used a whole can of whole tomatoes. I will definitely make this again!

This is a great substantial, filling soup.  I didn't process it because I like my soup thick and chunky.  I enjoyed it with cornbread and plan to make it again.

This is a delicious soup, and easy to prepare -- a winning combination!  Like some others, I doubled the cumin and I added 1/2 tsp curry as well -- everything else was as per the recipe.  Will make again!

This is a very nice and quickly put together soup.  

I found the cooking time a bit long for the simmering stage-red lentils cook so quickly--so I shaved at least 10 minutes off of the simmering time.
I added much more Cumin and Thyme than the recipe called for, as well as a dash of Nutmeg which really brightened all of the flavors.

Surprisingly good--inspires you to try different fruit/legume combos like pumpkin for example!

A wonderfully different tasting soup!  I needed to cook my lentils longer than 30 minutes (used brown lentils) and so needed to add some more broth so it wasn't too thick.  My soup-loving husband went back for seconds and has booked the leftovers for Sunday supper.  I also added 1 tsp cumin instead of half and blended it all as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks Karena

Very nice. I always pre-soak lentils. Sort of cold cooking. And I keep acids away from them until they are cooked, including tomato and the apricot. In fact, a way to keep lentils from falling apart is to add tomato or lemon juice while they are still intact. But this was too good to make so little of.

This was a good recipe as long as you like lentil soup (which I just found out that my husband does not).  I think I will add more apricots next time. I was expecting it to be a bit sweeter.  I followed the advice of others and added extra cumin (1 tsp. extra).

Wonderful soup -- and much more interestig than run-of-the-mill lentil soup.  I doubled the amount of cumin and added some ancho chili powder to make it a little spicier.

I did like this recipe but i instantly made some changes. First I used coconut oil to sauté the onions and garlic. I doubled this recipe. I cooked and drained the entire bag of red lentils. I used a can of stewed tomatoes. Instead of removing 1/2 and blending I used a hand blender to make creamy.  It is now a charming warm and delicate course to enhance a much richer Entrée.

The apricots and lemon juice added a new dimension to lentil soup which was very good.  I did use more like a half cup of apricots though and left the tomatoes out.

I actually wrote the recipe down wrong and put in 7 cups of stock so I added a can of garbanzo beans, doubled the cumin and added cayenne pepper. I used a couple tablespoons of fresh German Thyme from my garden.  My husband and I loved it.

I agree on doubling the amount of seasonings and to be careful about not adding too many extra apricots because it can make the soup too sweet.  I made this with a homemade vegetable stock, so I also had carrots and celery in it and thankfully the carrots didn't make it too sweet.

This was just ok, I've made much more satisfying lentils before.  This could have been because I used fresh apricots ( almost a cup).  I also added cayenne powder, turmeric and a bit of curry powder all of which lent the soup a spiced flavor, but overall this just didn't wow me.  I will have to try it with dried apricots next time.

I love lentils and have several favorite soup recipes, but will not count this as one of them.  It was good, but not fabulous.  My husband is not a great fan of lentils, but he loves apricots, so I hoped to entice him by adding more than 1/2 cup (instead of 1/3 cup) called for in the recipe. Even so, their flavor was hardly noticeable.  I used canned tomatoes, which was extra liquid, but still needed to add another cup and 1/2 of broth to give it the consistency we like.  It was not bad, but I think I will not make it again.

Delicious! I used 1 1/2 c. petite diced tomatoes, which I added with lentils and vegetable broth. After reading other reviews, I upped the cumin to 1 tsp. and added one diced sweet potato. Simmering all ingredients together, I needed to add 2-3 c. water, but it was still very thick and tasty. My family enjoyed it.

SO AMAZING. I've been trying to enjoy lentils for so long but always used recipes that left me disappointed. UNTIL I FOUND THIS. Om nom nom. I followed exactly as is, except used canned tomatoes and doubled the spices. Definitely pair this with a whole grain of some sort - over rice, with bread, etc. It becomes a meal that way and leaves you full for quite some time. Will be making this one again, for sure. (:

This is great! I can't wait to eat it tomorrow, when it's had a chance to get even better. I doubled the cumin, but kept the thyme at 1/2 tsp. I also used veggie broth, since I'm a vegetarian. I didn't seed or peel the tomatoes and didn't blend half of the soup. It was still great. A real keeper!

I added 8 cups of veggie broth to satisfy 2 cups of lentisl.  It still came out a very thick soup.  I also used a can of petite cut tomatoes and double the amount of apricots. Overall it was excellent!  It reminded me of chutney!

REALLY GOOD!!  this is a great recipe for lentils.  i used green lentils, doubled the spices, used cherry tomatoes seeds and all, and doubled the lemon juice.  Don't skip the lemon juice because it really adds a great flavor.  i also used 1/2 cup of apricots and chopped them up in my bullet to very small pieces..it worked perfectly.  Lastly, I did puree 1/2 the soup in my bullet just before serving and found that to be very important to give the soup some body.  i will be making this recipe for many more dinners!!! loved it!!

This was very good! The apricots added a nice sweet taste. I didn't add tomatoes because they aren't in season, aside from that I followed the recipe as is. Very easy and healthy, too!

This was my first time cooking with lentils, and my family was pleasantly surprised.  This recipe has very good flavor.  I followed directions as stated in the recipe, and mine turned out thick.  It was way to thick to be a soup, so i made some rice to have with it. Didi end up adding more cumin and thyme at the end after tasting it.  May try adding 1/2 cup dried apricots next time instead of 1/3 cup.

This is a recipe which strangely pulled together in the end.  I started off with a bit more broth than called for.  My lentils didn't seem to be getting soft and I was losing all my liquid, so I added another can... and another can ... and still they didn't get as soft as I would have liked.  I doubled the cumin which, had I not added the extra two cans, I would have definitely regretted, but since I DID add the extra broth the extra cumin was fine.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes since that is what I had on hand.  At first I emulsified about 3/4 of the soup but the lentils that weren't emulsified were NOT soft enough so I did the rest.  It tasted okay, but not great, and then I remembered the lemon juice.  THATs where things got strange.  The addition of the lemon juice completely turned my "okay" soup into a "really really good" soup.  Go figure.  I'll make it again, probably, but never for guests (b/c the end result looked kind of like dog food).  BTW, the apricots all but disappeared... I never tasted one. Oh, and it fed 2 adults and one child with only a small bowl left, so if you're feeding more than that double the recipe!

Delicious! It sounds strange initially, but once you try it, it's absolutely amazing. Very easy to make. I chopped up the apricots into small pieces first.

I don't know why it took me so long to rate this.  We love it, and we've served it several times over to guests.  Everyone raves about this soup.  We maybe have added a few more apricots and a few more lentils.  I don't really know.  Cooking is an art, not a science, right?  This is a great soup!

I love this! The only two things I do differently: I don't puree it. Wish I could, but I don't have a blender! Also, I use veggie stock (I'm a vegetarian). Very good... sometimes I crave it!

Really great flavors. I haven't had this soup in years and I was so happy to rediscover it here. I used vegetable broth and added the 1/2 cup of quinoa. Excellent vegan soup.

This is absolutely delicious.  I wasn't expecting more than an ok result as I don't consider lentils the most exciting food, but I went back for seconds, thirds and even fourths! Changes I made were: replaced the chicken broth with water and a tablespoon of vegetarian chicken-style seasoning, replaced the fresh tomato with a can of chopped tomatoes(drained) and used the juice of half a small lime. My husband loved this as well, and I will definitely be making this again!

This is a good base recipe but is somewhat bland and would be much better as a heartier soup.  I thought it could have used potatoes and maybe zucchini or squash.  We added hot sauce and extra pepper to give it more flavor.  We will definitely make it again but will make quite a few changes.

This was surprisingly fantastic! I wasn't sure about the apricots. I was just searching for recipes with lentils and had dried apricots on hand. I thought that this might be an okay way to use them. Everyone in my family thought that the combination sounded horrible. They were quite pleasantly surprised by how excellent this soup is! I used regular tomatoes instead of roma and didn't peel or seed them. I also did not place 1/2 of the soup in the blender. It was still wonderful! I will be making this again! It is healthy and unusual and tasty enough to serve to guests!

This was delicious, cheap, and easy! I made a few changes by subbing in beef broth (it was all I had) for the chicken and herbs de provence for the dried thyme (ditto). I didn't bother pureeing it because the lentils were cooked until soft. My Dad thought this was too sweet, but both my Mom and I loved it.

This is delicious! I only had green lentils, but it was still so amazing. I used 5 cups of water with vegetable bouillon and ended up adding about 1.5 additional cups of water after it simmered for 30 minutes. My only criticism is that this makes about 4 cups of soup total, so if you are feeding a family, you will need to double the recipe.

So simple and delicious.  Really easy to make and it smelt so good my 7 and 4 year olds wanted to try it - and liked it!  Next time I will use fresh thyme - not dried - for a more authentic flavour. This will be a regular on our dinner menu from now on. Thanks.

A delicious soup!  The texture is perfect- like a bisque - creamy without any cream.  Definitely do not add more apricot - it is exactly the right level of sweetness as is.  A great winter soup!

This easy to make soup was delicious- a tasty way to incorporate dried apricots into a soup. I found I needed to add more water as the soup simmered, or it would have ended up more like a porridge. Blending only half and leaving the rest chunky gave it a nice texture, which you want to retain. I will make this again.

This is a nice change from the usual lentil soups.  The only changes I made to the recipe were that I added twice as much apricot (and heck, next time I'll triple it) and I also had to add an extra cup of water because it got very thick.

I tried this recipe just because I was intrigued by the combination of flavours, and I'm so glad I did! Very tasty - I made no changes.

my husband loved this recipe.  to me it was more like a lentil chili.  I prefer carrots, celery, etc... in my soup.

This is one excellent soup.  Even my young kids enjoyed it.  The only substitutions I made were to use 3 sm. cans tomato sauce (as I was out of fresh tomatoes) and I used the juice and pulp of an entire lemon.  The results were fantastic.  We will definitely enjoy this soup again.

Oh my gosh, what a fabulous soup (especially if you enjoy different and exotic flavours).  The only changes I made were to eliminate the thyme, and add more cumin (about 2 tbsps total based on other reviews).  I didn't bother seeding and peeling my tomatoes, and used 2 cans of vegetable broth and water to total about 6 cups of stock.  I pureed it all with my hand blender right in the pot.
Very yummy, my baby tried it and got angry when I wouldn't give him more!
Thanks Karena for this great recipe.

I did this recipe in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes. I used canned tomatoes, so it didn't need additional cooking time at the end.  I also added 1/2 c. white quinoa before cooking which was excellent.  The lemon juicew definantly brightened the flavor.  I added a tsp. of honey to cut the acidity.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great soup! I used only 1 T. of oil (cuts about 40 calories per serving, and it's plenty for sauteing); used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of messing with peeling and chopping romas. I'm not too fond of cumin, so substituted with 2 t. of curry powder. I think the lemon juice is optional -- I tasted the soup several times during the cooking process, and don't think the lemon juice added anything essential. Turned out fabulous! Really, really tasty.

I felt adventurous today, so gave this recipe a try.  It's not a recipe I would make every day, but if you are tired of the same old soups, it's a nice change.  The taste is quite unique, but good.  Tending to the tomatoes took longer than everything else--about twenty minutes.  The instructions did not specify what size to cut the apricots into, so I left them whole, but will probably dice them next time.  When I put 1/2 of the soup in the blender, I put all of the apricots I could fish out in the blender as well.  I didn't want any of my family members to freak out when they bit into an apricot.  The rest of my family isn't as adventurous as I am.  Everybody liked the soup though.

Maybe I expected too much but it didn't seem that the apricot flavor came thru very much. It was overpowered by all the other flavors.

This is my new favorite soup! There is so much flavor, texture and depth to it. Each bite had a little something different. It was tangy, a little sweet, earthy and very fragrant. 

The only changes I made were to add canned tomatoes (it's what I had on hand) and homemade vegetable stock. 

I will be making this for years to come.

I used vegetable stock, added a cubed sweet pototoe, 1/2 cup of quinoa and doubled the cumin and garlic.  I did not have fresh tomato so I used a large can of cubed tomato. 
I also increased the stock by one cup.
I served it with toasted naan bread. Yum! 
Everyone loved it and wanted it added to the rotation.

I've been making this soup for over 20 years, after finding the recipe in a newspaper cooking section as 'Armenian Lentil and Apricot Soup'.  Even people who dislike the sludginess of lentils rave about this.  It's a breeze for the cook.  You can whip this up in less than an hour.

I use pretty much the same recipe as the original poster with these modifications:

1.  If fresh tomatoes are not available or if I'm feeling lazy, I'll substitute a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chiles.  Perfect!  (It does well with a spicier touch.)

2.  I'll use 10-12 dried half-apricots, dicing them or cutting them into strips.

3.  If short on apricots, I'll augment the flavor with apricot preserves, using up to 1/4 cup.

4. Brown-green lentils pack a bit more protein than the red, and are just as tasty as the red ones.  However, if presentation is your concern,  red lentils make for a much prettier soup.

Gee, I feel like making another batch, right now!

Yummmm. This is delicious. I love apricot anything, so I had to give this a try. Flavors were great. I doubled the spices and added a little curry, like others before me. I also put in some sweet potatoes and used green lentils since I had them on hand. Will definitely make again. Very hearty!

Very good. I used petite diced tomatoes in a can instead of finding the tomatoes. I didn't blend as instructed. I ate it over some brown rice and realized that I should have chopped up the apricots to spread out the flavor because that extra tang was delicious. Once I found my handheld blender, I completed the last steps. ThenI was like oh now I see what everyone is raving about.  I would suggest using more than a 1/3 cup of apricots, though. Instead a a half cup and I  would double on the seasonings. Really, it is good as is, but I would likely add some spinach to the next time around  and I will alternate it with quinoa and brown rice. The rice is good for fiber, but the quinoa provides more protein..
 (Update) I did it for the third time but I used organic vegetable stock from whole foods, and I let the lentils sit in water for two hours. This time the consistency was more like a soup because when I used the dry lentils they would soak up the stock. Also the seasoning in the vegetable stock just gives it more flavor. I would recommend  vegetable stock over chicken.

Yummy!  Everyone I've served it to enjoys it -- meat eater , vegetarian or vegan.  It's a keeper.  If you're in a hurry whiz whole tomato in the blender or use a little tomato paste...works either way.

This soup is SO GOOD!! I made a double batch. Everyone who has tasted it has wanted the recipe. I read a lot of the reviews and took the advice to double the garlic, cumin and thyme. Also didn't have the apricots, but as someone else did, used mango instead. Great as leftovers as well! Will keep this and make many more times!

This is a delicious, to die for soup!!! As other reviewers suggested I made a few changes--7 cups of stock,  1 can diced, drained tomatoes, 1 & 1/2 teaspoons of cumin, 1 teaspoon of dried thyme and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

This was unexpected but really delicious.  I wasn't sure it would be something I'd like, but I did and I'm glad I tried it.  I did add grains - barley - to bulk it and I've also added both purple and sweet potatoes for flavor and texture.  I have also added spinach at the last few minutes of cooking but it doesn't need any of those things.  It's good as written.  Ok, it's better with additional grains added, but it's lovely as it is.

Made this. Time and time again, and I love it. So good as is, but I started to add a cup of cooked brown rice to bolster nutrition. I also had fun and used red onion and nectarines instead, and add a carrot and chard. Wow. Complete, beautiful and hearty winter bowl. So so good.

Wow! This is great combination of flavors! Don't be afraid of the apricots - they are the subtle star in this mouth-watering soup. Made just as written and it was fantastic. Definitely is on the list of regularly cooked meals here.

Made this for the second time with some modifications that made the second batch much better -- for our taste -- than the first. First, used 2 1/2 cups of chicken bouillon and 2 1/2 cups of plain water to cut the salt content. Second, along with the tomatoes, added a tablespoon of tomato paste to intensify the tomato aspect. Third, with the cumin and thyme, used a full teaspoon each rather than a half. Fourth, increased the dried apricots to a little over half a cup -- really made a difference in bringing the apricot taste forward. End result - bliss.

I made this exactly as instructed. My kids were home from college and can be picky, but everyone loved it and even had seconds. I doubled the recipe and will definitely make it again. I was tempted to add more apricots, and was glad I did not (due to the other reviews). The balance of flavors was perfect as-is.

Excellent soup!  Wanted just a little more chicken flavor , so added two tablespoons low sodium chicken "Better than Bouillon" to the two quarts of chicken broth used .

Really tasty.  I never tried anything like it.  I used heaping 1/2 teaspoons for the spices.  I wish I chopped the apricots in advance because they didn't puree afterwords. I actually forgot the lemon juice and it was still delicious.

This soup is fantastic!  It's a great soup for warm or cold weather.  I added a pinch of sugar the second time I made it and it brought out the apricot flavor but it still I not too sweet.  For me the compliment of the slightly sweet apricot with the heat of some added red pepper flakes made this soup perfect.

Wildest, least prepared "wing-it" I've ever done... And it turned out good.

Cranberries (no apricots), Italian chicken sausage cooked in (no cx stock), roma-sized spoonfuls of canned crushed tomatoes (you guessed it!) and oregano (no thyme).  OH!  And no lemon, but probably wouldn't have added it anyway.  

Now let's see how it tastes as leftovers!

Quite tasty - used up leftover chicken broth made from the bones of our (small) Thanksgiving meal, so that there were small chicken bits in it as well. They went very nicely with the apricots. I also thought more water would be useful, and more spices (I added sumac - LOVE sumac!). I didn't puree, either - it doesn't really need it.

I made enough for 8 servings.  Used veggie broth for my vegetarian friends.  Added 3/4 cup quinoa.  2 tsps. of the spices.  Accidentally poured way too much black pepper in but that actually gave it a good flavor.  The quinoa seemed to soak up the juice so I added approx 2 more cups of broth after pureeing. Also added a bit of cayenne pepper.
It was very good, but, I think the chicken broth might have more flavor.

I loved it. My 12 year old, not so much.  But I also didn't use the red lentils, green ones instead and no tomatoes so it didn't look like the picture but it still tasted delicious.  I especially love the lemon juice!

Pretty sure mine, with brown lentils as red seem to be unavailable at our 4 area groceries, looked unappealing after being puréed. Did not think the lemon juice helped in that overall impression either.

Very good! Based on the other reviews I also doubled the spices and I used fresh apricots instead of dried. I waited to add them until the second part of the cooking. 
For a little variety, I only used 1 cup of lentils and 1/4 cup of Teff--great addition.

I think I rarely enough give 3 or less stars, but this is the case when the recipe with glorious rewiews failed for us. All family agree, the soup was totally bland for our taste. The apricots after simmering for 30-40 min were overcooked and didn't give much flavor. Sorry, but this soup was just ordinary and tasteless for us.

Delicious.  It has a sweet flavor, which at first was a little surprising.  It was wonderful, though.  It will definitely be used again. I added a little extra water as people said it was thick, and a little extra cumin.

I made this last New Year's Day & finally decided to make it again exactly 1 year later!  I didn't use all of the dried apricots...now I wish I had.  I'm not a big fan of cumin, so I only added a tiny bit.  This year when I sauteed the onions & garlic, I also added a cut up chicken breast & added that to the blended along with everything else.  The soup came out very thick.  I love a thick soup, but will probably thin my leftovers out a bit with some chicken broth tomorrow.

I've made this recipe several times already. I always make a double batch since it's good left over lunch on those rainy days. The only change I made to the recipe is I puree the whole thing. I use my immersion blender right in the pot. Love it!

Splendidly delish! I serve this to company and it tastes like you've spent hours on it. Only thing different is I use a can of undrained diced tomatoes instead of the 3 plum tomatoes called for. Try this with some good crusty bread on the side and a nice salad.

I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this, but what came out was super bland! I do like a lot of flavor (spices and heat) in my food though. I ended up adding a couple handfuls of cilantro, a serrano chili, turmeric, and coriander. With these additions I think it's a yummy soup - but it hardly resembles the recipe I set out to make. Thanks for an interesting idea though!

Really yummy, and a nice change from other lentil soups I've made.  I agree with others that you really don't need to put any of the soup in a blender to puree.  I found that the lentils got quite mushy at the bottom of the pot, and by simply stirring well, the soup became quite smooth.  I also doubled the cumin, as others suggested, too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

yummy, filling, healthy and cheap! i listened to the comments and added extra cumin & thyme....then wished i hadn't, i think the soup would have been perfectly balanced without it. i used exactly the amount of apricots as per the recipe, chopping them finely, and didnt blend for a chunky soup. :o)

I was skeptical of this recipe, but it's really tasty!  It has a combination of ingredients than seem unusual, but meld well.  I didn't puree any of the soup since the lentils broke down enough during the cooking process.  Also, I cannot taste the apricots so I think you'd be safe in omitting them if you don't have them.

Mind-blowing. Very unusual and tasty dish, excellent as leftovers as well. Made it with the lamb tagine and had a moroccan night. I added extra apricots and liked the additional flavor.

This was one of the best soups I've ever had.  I only made a few changes:  1)  I added 1/2 of a 16 oz. can of drained/rinsed diced tomatoes (didn't have any fresh).  Also, used 4 cups chicken broth because that was all I had.  3)  Did not add lemon juice.    Otherwise, followed it completely and it was excellent.  My wife loved it, I loved it.  Immediately made a second batch to take leftovers to work for lunch this week.  Such a creamy texture (pureed it) and sweet/smoky flavor.  New favorite for me!

Great recipe.  I also noticed that this turned out very thick, which was fine.  I added a little extra apricot but my husband said he could not taste it... he loved it anyways.  I could not find red lentils so I used the regular kind.  I also like to add to the flavor by increasing the spices.  Very easy and VERY filling!

What a wonderful tasting soup. Thanks so much for posting this recipe! I made it exactly as posted and I was very pleased. The apricot is lovely with the lentils. I can't wait to eat this again and again.

Wow, this was excellent! The apricot added a rich yet subtle flavor that was just perfect with the rest of the ingredients. The only changes I made were to use veg broth and fresh thyme. This was surprisingly filling, but it didn't leave us feeling uncomfortably full, because the ingredients aren't heavy. A new favorite!

Very good, very filling.  Didn't change a thing (no need to). I was nervous about the apricot, but it was so mild yet definitely there.  All the flavors blended so well with each other.  Even my very picky son ate some (not a lot, but some).

Great soup!  I read the other reviews and added more cumin (doubled the amount called for) and also a pinch of cayanne pepper to make it a little hotter.  I also used veggie broth as we are vegetarian and it turned out well.  My husband and I both ate way too much.

This soup is unbelievably amazing. I've made it time and again and it's always a wonderful and healthy crowd pleaser. I double the cumin and that about does it. A very special soup.

Quick and delicious.  I subbed a can of apricot halves (pureed) for dried and it was fine - just cook a  bit longer to steam off extra liquid.

I was skeptical at first because there didnt seem to be very much providing this recipe with flavor, but after I doubled the cumin, this soup was really quite good. I'm going to make this regularly. Its easy too!

My daughter and I really enjoyed this soup. The flavor was great.  I accidently bought the wrong color lentils and the soup turned out brownish green. Next time I'll be sure to get the red ones.  The taste was still good just wasn't very appealing to the eye. I served it with corn tortillas cut into strips and baked in the oven.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow, both hearty with a hint of sweetness – just delicious and healthy.  I wouldn’t change a thing.  To peel the tomatoes easier, I cut a shallow X in the bottom end of each tomato (opposite side of core) and dropped them in a pan of boiling water for 15 seconds and then transferred the tomatoes into a bowl of ice water.  I then immediately peeled the tomatoes with a paring knife and the skin just came right off.

Loved it.  Husband did not like the apricots whole, but passed them my way, and agreed they added a unique flavor to the soup. Also used regular lentils as red was not available and it was great.   Also, used a can of whole tomatoes and a  handful of fresh grape tomatos and it was really good.

DEEEELISH!! I love traditional lentil soup, but this one is so interesting and different. Absolutely love it. As recommended by other users, I added a handful of quinoa. I also used canned lentils, which worked just fine. I will make this again and again (and again)!

This recipe goes back to my heritage.  We have been known for apricots so this is the most special recipe and the most tastiest.  My family flip their lid with this as did I as none of my cook books has this variation.  Thank you Karena

I love the apriot and lentil mixture.  I do agree with another reviewer that the tomatoes could be optional.  This is a nice recipe as is, but I think it's also a great starting point for playing with ingredients.  Next time, I think I might add cloves.

This is a delicious, hearty soup.  I even made the black bread to go with it, per suggestion-- it does go good together!  Fills you up fast, so the six servings suggested has last me for forever!

This soup was pretty good. Though I don't think I'll make it again with the apricots. Will try again without.  The apricot flavor is unusual in soup.  Whole family ate it and said it was ok.  Thanks for the recipe, Karena!

Really good soup! I read the reviews, and increased the spices, added curry powder, omitted the lemon, and also added about a half cup of garbanzo beans I had in the fridge. The flavors are better the longer it sits.

Excellent even when unblended (no blender or food processor here).  We just made sure to cut the apricots into bits.  There were only two of us and the entire pot was gone in two days.  Next time we'll increase the portions for extra to freeze and maybe try some turkey in it.

Awesome Awesome and more awesome!!!! I increased the apricots to 1 cup and chopped them into thirds. I also added 6 cups (one large can) on chicken broth and increased the lentils too....It was soooo good. My two year old LOVED it and so did my 10 month old!!

This is so wonderful and sticks to your ribs!  I had trouble finding red lentils.  The regular ones work great, but are just slightly larger so if you don't like them al dente, you may need to increase the initial simmer time just a titch.  It's savory in an Indian cooking kind of way.  So yummy!

SOOOOO good.  It makes a great comfort food.  My husband thought I was crazy at first, but now he actually asks me to make this soup.  And he eats lentils in silent protest.

INCREDIBLE!!!  This is a great VEGAN recipe if you replace the chicken stock with veggie stock.  I also used about 8 - 10 fresh apricots since they're in season.  I took the advice of other reviews and used more cumin AND 1/2tsp of curry powder.  My very picky vegetarian boyfriend, who never eats leftovers, had this three meals in a row.  Contrary to some reviews, I think that this would be a great dish for entertaining (vibrant color), especially if you want to impress vegetarian/vegan friends.

The flavor is very different and unique, but it was good. It is not a company dish unless you know the people you are serving this for are not picky at all:-)

I wasn't sure how the apricots would be in soup but it was tasty.  I added unpeeled & unseeded tomatoes with the lentils & stock, omitted the thyme, & used 1/8 tsp. cumin.  I cooked it for an hour instead of pureeing it, & it was fine (even the whole dried apricots dissolved).  I'd suggest that if you go to the trouble of making this that you double the recipe.

Well, I tried this recipe in my search for high fiber meals that my daughter would like and I thought for SURE she would;  she didn't - it tasted like "bonzo beans" to her, but my husband and I loved it.  I also tried it because all the comments were, "different, but good".  SO....I totally agree with that.  This is a different kind of soup, but really, really tasty.    I used a can of diced tomatoes, drained, in place of the romas, and completely pureed it so that no chunks of apricots "surprised" my daughter!  And, per another reviewers suggestions, I diced up the apricots first, as well.  It's a keeper!  Really, really yummy and healthy.  Thank you, Karena!

I didn't have cumin, so I added a teaspoon of curry instead.  It came out great!  The next day it was thick enough to serve over basmati rice for some nice leftovers.

What a delightful discovery!  This soup is exquisite with its subtle flavors and slight tang.  I made it strictly according the instructions, except for peeling the tomatoes and I minced the apricots before cooking.  I would consider pureeing the whole thing and serving it chilled as a summer soup.  I have shared this with several friends who have all raved about it!

This is a terrific recipe served hot or cold.  I have a sweet tooth, so next time i'll add extra apricots.  Also, I forgot the lemon juice, but it still turned out really well.
