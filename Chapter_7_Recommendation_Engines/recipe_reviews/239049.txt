I did as instructed by with a few changes.. Instead of just putting dried herbs under the hen, I added some chicken stock, chardonnay, and apple cider to the bottom of my roasting pan and basted the hen every 15 minutes or so. It came out sweet and delicious. Definitely  a keeper.

I had it last night for thanksgiving, it was perfect! I just did the sauce a little thicker, otherwise, I followed the recipe closely. It was very tasteful, well seasoned, nice blend of flavors. Excellent!

This was a very savory and delicious recipe.
I served the Cornish Hens and Cranberry Stuffing with Maple Sauce along with mashed potatoes and tangy French-cut green beans.  Umm Umm Good!
The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was very time consuming to make as the recipe reads.  For that reason, I used Pepperridge Farms Herb Stuffed Bread Cubes which cut down at least one hour of prep time.  And I also used Simple Truth Dried Cranberries and chopped walnuts.
During the first 45 mins. of baking, I covered the Cornish Hens with foil and threw in some mini-carrots and onion cubes around them to make them nice and moist.  Then the last 15 mins. I removed the foil and basted them with the Maple Syrup Sauce made from the pan drippings until they were brown.

Impressively beautiful and presents extremely well! Delicious and easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly as written without any modifications. I even made walnut bread from scratch for the stuffing so that I can stay true to the recipe. I will definitely make this again for future holidays!

I made this tonight.  This recipe deserves 10 out of 5 stars!!!  I did add a bit of dry white wine to the reduction, but other than that,I stayed true to the recipe. It is a recipe that I'll make again.  I used a whole grain oatmeal bread for the stuffing.  I had grilled asparagus for a veggie.  My husband and son LOVED it.  It plates up really nice too.
Also, I used a 24" cast iron skillet to bake them in (I made 4).  It transferred nicely to the stove top to make the reduction.

This was very good.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn't as amazing as I expected it to be.  It was actually pretty easy to prepare, but it took me at least an hour to prep everything. I expect that with practice, I could do it faster, and I'm sure some of it could be done in advance to make it easier.  I don't remember having cooked a Cornish Hen before, so, once served, I had some difficulty cutting it and getting the dressing out in the elegant fashion I was hoping for.  Basically, I made a sloppy mess.  I did follow the recipe exactly, and the bird was juicy.  The sauce was just sweet enough and I loved the look and taste of the cranberries.  Certainly worth trying again, and maybe my finesse will improve with practice.

I thought this recipe turned out great!  Hens were so moist, and the cranberry really adds some nice flavor. I did follow this exactly, even adding the egg in the stuffing mix, although I have never used egg before. I also tried the au jus mixture at the end....it seemed like I had quite a bit of juice from the hens; but they may have been still slightly (?) frozen when I baked. Cooked just an hour, temperature was right. Just a simple to execute recipe. Thanks!

I made this for some picky eaters and everyone loved every part! I added 2Tbsp of white wine to the sauce which was nice. I think I'd do that again if I were to remake it.

Impressive looking and delicious.  My first time preparing a Cornish game hen and it was not difficult.  Followed recipe as written with exception of using dried instead of fresh herbs.  I basted with dropping every 20 minutes.  Will make again.  Thx for recipe Chef John.

This recipe was easy to use & tasted so good with the game hens. 
I went with stuffing on the side... in an uncovered dish for 35-40 minutes, rather than in the birds. 

I prefer a crunchier stuffing & this  fit the bill nicely. This was only my 2nd ever stuffing attempt - and there was none leftover! 

Many thanks to all the reviewers for tips!

Disappointed.  Followed the recipe to a T.  Found the dressing to be mushy.  It needs less liquid.  The sauce's taste was dominated by the chicken broth.  I found actual cranberry sauce to be more complimentary.  Just felt the hens needed a bit more pizzaz.  I liked the fresh herbs, but buying them is an added expense.

The hens were perfect, tender and juicy. The starring was a bit to dry and not to my taste. But I’ lol definitely be eating game hen in the future!!
