This is SO SO SO very good. I used a reduced fat mayonnaise and added a touch more dijon mustard. My kids and I ate every bite of this. They had theirs spread on whole wheat bread, I spread mine inside a hollowed out cucumber.

Simple and delicious! I never would have thought to add basil to egg salad, but it really works. I cut the recipe in half and opted for Hellman's light mayo and in addition to the tomato slices I added thin sliced English cucumber. This perfect with a side of fresh fruit for a filling and flavorful lunch. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe earned each of its 5-stars. It is simply outstanding. The 1st time I made it exactly as written and was very pleased. The 2nd time I doubled the ingredients, added extra fresh basil, fresh minced onions, minced orange bell peppers, and chopped spicy pickles. Lordy, Lordy, I had to force myself to stop "tasting" it.  Give this recipe a try. Quickly, it will become one of your favorites!

Very nice combination of flavors.  Needed more crunch.  Would make again but would add celery and onions.

4.75 A delightful change for egg salad with the sweet basil and onion and garlic powders.  Put my open faced sandwich atop multigrain bread, with pickles on the side.  yummeroo!  :)

Very good on toasted gluten-free bread with mixed baby greens and tomato.  Otherwise, the only change I made was to be heavy handed with the mustard (didn't measure).  Next time: I'll either add some Kosher Salt Flakes or some olives/capers.  There's room for more saltiness.
My son loved it.  He asked if I had added pesto to it.  He wants me to make it again, which is an absolute first for egg salad at my house!
