Easy to make.... But very delicious! I've had it on pasta salad with chicken and romaine lettuce added (after have the same salad at a restaurant and absolutely enjoying it and wanting to have more at home) the only thing missing was pineapple coconut sauce.... This made my salad!!!!

The sauce was a bit thin, will think about that next time I make it. Sauce was very much like Red Lobsters. Everyone liked it!
