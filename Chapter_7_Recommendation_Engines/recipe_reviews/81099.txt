I agree that this is a good basic recipe yet I, too, made some changes.  I cooked the rice with 3 cups of chicken broth for about 30 minutes on the stovetop (until all the broth was absorbed). Like WATERGIRL1 I used frozen broccoli (petite florets) instead of the green beans.  I also omitted the dill & water.  I only added about a cup of milk -- just until the mixture looked slightly creamy.  I also saved 1/2 cup of the cheese to sprinkle on top before putting it in the oven.  Baked it for 1 hour, it looked and tasted great.  My family says it's a "keeper".  Thanks, GRLBUG, for a good meal idea using brown rice.

Giving 5 stars with the following changes: used 2 cans broccoli cheese soup, approx 3 cups broccoli, 1 cup milk, lemon seasoning salt, 1/2 tsp italian seasoning, 1 1/2 cup low fat cheddar cheese, used more garlic because we prefer more - omitted water, green beans,  basil and dill.  I cooked the rice in 3 cups of chicken broth about 40 min, til liquid absorbed.  Sprinkled lemon pepper on boneless chicken and baked covered until tender. Steamed fresh broccoli.  Mixed all together well and baked for about hour.  Even my picky 7 year old daughter ate!

It was okay. It would have been better with broccoli instead of green beans.(With that change you would use a different soup.)The flavor was okay too. I like dill, maybe some people don't. Some of the ratings baffle me. They made So Many changes, they weren't even making the same casserole. If I make it again, I will change some things. At least give a recipe a chance before you make sweeping changes and give it a bad rating. Maybe your changes are what messed it up. Just a thought.

Suggest longer baking time - add additional 15 to 20 minutes.  Great mix of flavors.  Will make again.

I used white rice instead of brown and 16 oz. frozen greens beans instead of canned.  I also increased the cheese from 1.5 cups to 2 cups.

I found this to be very very bland.  I had to add lots of hot sauce and salt to it to give it flavor.  I think this i a good base for a recipe, but it needs something else to give it flavor.

This was very good and I will make it again with a few slight variations. The baking time was about 40 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  I stirred the casserole about every half hour as the rice seemed to settle to the bottom and clump. I will probably cut back on the dill weed. It seemed to overwhelm other flavors. I will probably add celery also. This dish has all the food groups except fruit. I enjoyed it enough myself and shared it with others who were impressed.

This is a good basic recipe.  I covered my casserole dish with its lid while baking.  I also used chopped frozen broccoli (defrosted in the microwave) instead of the canned green beans.

It doesn't say whether to cover this or not, so I didn't.  After the suggested baking time, it was still soup and the rice was not done.  I would cut the amount of garlic down to 1 clove as well.  I probably won't make it again though.

This recipe is really good, but I gave it 4 stars because of the cream of asparagus soup ingredient. Anything in a can is unhealthy. I think it will be better if you made your own soup of asparagus or broccoli or something else. I also substituted Cheddar cheese for Feta just because I love it (Feta cheese, that is; I recommend authentic Bulgarian one from specialized store) and it is healthier.

We love the flavor of this dish. Sautee the chicken with a tablespoon of olive oil with the onion and garlic to flavor the chicken. Sautee until juices run clear. I made the rice separate using minute rice and the directions as per package. Dropped the water from recipe. Used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom in place of asparagus soup. It was very creamy. The other seasoning flavored nicely. Heated through in a large skillet. Spooned over rice. We are going to have left over the next day it was that good. This is a keeper. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I modified this recipe quite a bit, so I understand that rating it isn't quite fair - but I wanted to post my modifications if any of you are in the same boat. I didn't realize until I started that the recipe called for instant rice, and all I had was brown basmati. So, I cooked the brown rice in my cooker with less water than called for - so when it was done, it wasn't cooked all the way. Instead of water and boullion in my cooking liquid, I used a can of coconut milk (because it sounded good!). I added asparagus and dropped the raisins (I just couldn't bring myself to add them). Everything cooked wonderfully in the oven for 45 minutes and was delicious. I felt like the dish was missing a little extra sweetness that I like in my curry - but it could have been fixed with a little sugar added to the sauce on the stove top.

This was really good! I only changed a couple of things that made this easy and take less time. I used success brown rice, one large bag and cut water and milk back to 1 can of each. I sauté the onions in olive oil, than added the soup, water, milk and seasonings to the pan and heated them. After heating I added the rice and poured the sauce over the chicken that I had placed in the bottom of a 13x9 pan sprayed with olive oil. Sprinkled the cheese (which I reduced to about 1/2 cup for health reasons, since I didn't have lowfat cheese.) Baked it for 30 minutes. It was quite nice served with freshed sliced tomatoes! we'll keep this one!

While easy and not too bad, it really isn't something that I would make on a regular basis or to serve to company.

I thought this was ok...my teenager loved it.  I made some changes, first I cut it in half as 12 servings for 2 people was way too much.  I used cream of broccoli soup, sauted my chicken breast in some italian dressing, added the 1 glove of garlic along with a tsp of garlic powder. I Had to finish this off in the microwave as it was a bit soupy after the baking time but I think that was because I mistakenly added a bit to much water. I will make this again and play with it some more.

I'm lactose intolerant so I eliminated the milk and cheese. I cooked the brown rice in 2 cups of water to soften then I combined all the ingredients with one can of chicken broth and baked like normal. I calculated the entire casserole's calories at 900 with these changes. Still tastes yummy!

My family and I definetly dug this one! It seems easaly twikable to personal preferance which I like. The meat lovers didn't know they wern't eating meat either. I had some tomotio sause id made and people seemed to like that on it though I didn't put it on the one bite I had (I was on a juice fast). I think next time ill add a some corn and a little diced purple onion. I also think sour cream and cottage cheese would be a delicious addition to make it more of a mexican lasagna.

I was a little leery to try this recipe after the bad reviews.  So I decided to tweak it and make it my own.  I used 2 chicken quarters that I skinned and marinated them in italian dressing overnight.  I cooked the chicken at 350 degrees in a casserole dish covered with aluminum foil for 45 minutes.  Then I removed the chicken and drained the oil.  I cut the recipe in half since I was only cooking for two and I eliminated the dill, garlic, and onion.  I layered the rice/ soup mixture on the bottom of the dish and placed the chicken on top.  Then I cooked it covered for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, removed the foil, and cooked it uncovered for another 30 minutes.  It turned out great and was not soupy at all.  The rice was also done!
