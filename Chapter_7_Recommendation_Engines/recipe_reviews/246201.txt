Made it with 1t toasted sesame oil (yum) instead of peppers b/c I don't care for the heat.  Way too much bok choy.  Would make it again with more sesame oil, less bok choy and bit of salt or soy sauce.

This was the perfect solution for too much bok choy in my garden. I am not a big jalapeño fan so I substituted a teaspoon of roasted sesame oil. Perfect!!

I added fresh cilantro and fresh basil to this recipe as a garnish, it added a lot to the flavor.  Great recipe, we have made it several times.

This is a great, easy chicken soup! I followed the directions, just added a Serrano pepper because I like it spicy and a half teaspoon of sesame oil to give it that flavor. I cut my chicken up in bite size pieces so I didn’t have to shred it. It was done quickly and will warm up nicely for leftovers. Thank you for sharing! Oh! I also used whole30 compliant chicken broth to make it whole30!!

I substituted the jalapeño with red chilli paste (about 1 tablespoon), because that’s what i had. I also cut the raw chicken into smaller pieces before adding it to the soup first. Finally I added some rice noodles (I used pad Thai noodles) a couple of minutes before adding the bok choy - it was simply amazing! I was scared it would taste too much like chicken stock, but the chilli and ginger really gave it a nice fragrance and taste. Highly recommend!

Super simple to make and super tasty too! Gotta love chicken soup on a cold day, and this is a nice twist on the usual. I made it exactly as written. Just added a sprinkle of salt and pepper before serving. Would also be good with some soy sauce. I forgot to take the chicken breast out ahead of time, so I let it thaw just enough to cut into 3 chunks, then tossed it into the broth. Worked like a charm! I might increase the jalapeño next time, but peppers also vary so I might just have gotten a mild one. Will make this one again!
