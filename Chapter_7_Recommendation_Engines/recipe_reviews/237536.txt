Thank you for posting this!!!  I had NO IDEA steaming broccoli was this easy...AND...that I had the hardware to make it.  It may seem like a simple to post, but this has seriously changed the way I cook.  Thank you!!!

Found this recipe uninteresting. I had thought the bacon  would given it a bit of added flavour but it just didn't work for me. I will not try this again

Did exactly to the directions and turned out great.   I didn't add the bacon because I served it with salmon but topped it with shredded Parmesan cheese.

We eat paleo 75% of the time.  We love broccoli and the bacon bits made it better.

Not ashamed to admit Iâ€™ve never steamed broccoli in my life before. This helped me realize it was so simple. Thank you!
