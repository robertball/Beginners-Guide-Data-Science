This is similar to the  "franks hott sauce buffalo chicken dip". I change it up a bit and add onion and fresh garlic and sometimes red,green peppers. A definate favorite at any gathering at our house!!

Husband thought this was good, but could use some spices. I used reduced fat cream cheese, my own chicken breast meat and Frank's Hot Sauce. Very simple. Next time, I'll try this with ranch dressing mix and maybe mozzerella, as he thought that might be better.

YUM. I cubed some cooked chicken breast that I had leftover and just mixed everything together. It was so tasty and satisfied my hot wing craving!

I made this for work and it was so good. I just eye balled the wing sauce and used shredded mixed cheese but it was still really tasty and none was left.

This was a big hit. I used fresh chicken & buffalo wing sauce. Served it with celery. There wasn't any left. I also cooked in oven @350 for 15 - 20 min.

Was a hit at a party. Used a whole small bottle of franks red hot sauce, so more then a half cup. Was so easy and so good
