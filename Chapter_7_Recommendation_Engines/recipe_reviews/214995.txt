FABULOUS!! I really appreciated the previous reviews re the pepper. I'm one who follows recipes to the letter, and I likely would have added the amt of pepper called for, so my thanks to the previous reviewers for alerting me. I added the amt of pepper I would normally use in any recipe and the soup came out perfect. I LOVE this soup and it will definitely become a staple in my meal rotation. Great job!! Thank you so much!

Too much pepper by far! You can taste a brilliant soup hiding beneath a vicious layer of pepper here. I will make this again with a fraction of the pepper, but I used less than the prescribed amount and am kicking myself for not going with my instinct. Dangit!

Way, way WAY too much pepper! I think this recipe would be delicious if we hadn't completely overdosed it with pepper. Two tablespoons means you can almost not taste anything else about it, unfortunately. We are going to try to make it again, this time with perhaps 1 or 1/2 teaspoon pepper to start, since you can always add more if needed once it's been served. Definitely cut down on the pepper, did I mention that? : )

This should be renamed Pepper Soup!  I cut down the amounts of both the black and red pepper, and it wasn't enough!  I added carrots to make up for the broccoli that I didn't have, and left out the butter entirely.  I'll try this again without any pepper!

Hubby says this is the best vegetarian soup he's ever had! I substituted buckwheat for the barley and earth balance margarine for the butter due to allergy concerns. Per other reviews, I used 2 teaspoons black pepper and 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes  - that worked out perfectly. Didn't have celery or onion so I left those out and substituted 1 T. onion powder for the onion. Excellent soup! It would probably taste even better with the celery and onion. :) Oh, and I used full fat coconut milk and 3.25 cups water with 1/4 t. red miso instead of the vegetable broth.

I did not really care all that much for this soup.  The flavour was rather not to my liking, and there was just something about it that did not sit well with me.  I will not be making this again.  It is edible, but nothing more.  I am, however, glad I  tried it- the idea is good.

The pepper quantities are definitely typos: Should be TEASPOONS, not tablespoons. Yummy soup. I'd hoped for more coconut flavor, but I think we used extra-extra broccoli (it's fresh and bountiful), which masked the coconut flavor. Will make this again!

This was so good! I reduced the spice quite a bit to accomodate my eaters' preferences.

Obviously, the pepper measures are a mistake... I made it without the cow milk, just added more broth and I cooked some ham cubes with more onion and garlic to add with the barley at the end. Great idea mixing the blended soup with whole grains! Opens up a whole new world of mix and match... thanks!

We loved this recipe - 5 out of 5 people ate it at my house! The flavor was great and loved having all of the veggies in this soup. I did add some chicken pieces to the soup, mostly for my husband and oldest son, but I would have liked it without the chicken also. It did take some time chopping up the vegetables, but is well worth it. Two of my sons (ages 3 and 1) eat small servings, so this lasted us much longer than just six servings. I would say probably more like 8 or 9 for us. Great as leftovers since it so easy to warm up, and the flavor develops more that way too. Thanks for the recipes, HAP!
