I was wary trying this recipe since there were no reviews but I’ve been wanting to try and make this. I didn’t have sweet and sour sauce but did have Mae Ploy and used Yoshida’s sauce in place of teriyaki sauce. I also stirred in a handful of cashews at the end. It was delicious! We order this when we eat out and it’s so expensive for what’s in it. All my family gave this recipe a thumbs up and would eat it again!
