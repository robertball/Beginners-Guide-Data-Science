I definitely enjoyed the taste of this cake, but I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, which was enough for me. If I made it again I would add less milk because I think the batter was too runny. That might also help the peaches brown a little.

very good. don't overbake this cake, the special flavor of the crackers combines wonderfully with it being so moist. i added 1/4 tsp. peach extract to the batter and it was definatelly a special cake.

I used 1/2 package of vanilla instant pudding mix and 1 small package of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes (crumbled) instead of the 3/4 cup sugar to make the cake more firm and not-as-sweet. The result is pretty good. Worth a try. ^-^.

I was excited to make this because it was rated so well. I took it to a get together of friends. Thankfully they were all FRIENDS because this really wasn't that great. The texture was odd and a little runny and it was TOO sweet. I was not impressed.

Very nice.  I cut down the white sugar a bit and added abt /4 cup more graham crackers.  This is not really a torte to me, although it's not really a cake in my opinion either.  With more peaches it would end up more like a cobbler, which might be a cool idea for next time.  This is plenty sweet even without the full amount of sugar, and it's easy and fun to make.  The topping sort of absorbed into the peaches, so I might not do that again--I might do a cinnamon sugar layer instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy torte!  My first time making anything "upside down" so it was very fun and I felt a lot of anticipation.  I also felt that it was too wet, although I did add an extra quarter cup of graham cracker crumbs (just to use up the rest of my box).  After reading the reviews, I decided to crisp my torte right-side up in the oven for about 15-20 minutes at 300 degrees and then turned off the oven to let the torte dry.  It made it perfectly crisp on top yet still warm and moist on the inside :)

Oh and I added only 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 and it was perfect!
