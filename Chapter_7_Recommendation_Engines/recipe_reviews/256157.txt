Jan 8 2017 The first time that I make a recipe I try to stay as close to the written recipe as possible but I couldn't find Red RiverÂ® cereal so I subbed 1/4 cup cracked wheat and 1/4 cup 10 grain cereal. I don't have a bread pan and prefer a rustic loaf so I formed it into a round ball and baked it on a cookie sheet. If I were to make this again I would bake it in a dutch oven as that method produces a very crusty exterior.
