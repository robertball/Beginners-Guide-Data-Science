I tried this recipe last night in the crockpot and it was so good, the whole family liked it!  I added frozen chicken breasts into the sauce and also added fresh mushrooms, chopped onions, a tiny bit of garlic and a pinch of oregano, basil and thyme.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours and it turned out perfect.  This one is definitely a keeper!  Thank you!!

I was so happy to find a quick receipe for Chicken Marsala that tastes wonderful.  I add fresh mushrooms to this receipe and my children love it.

I was pleasantly surprised that such a simple recipe could taste so good!  I served mine over angel hair pasta, and I thought the taste was comparable to Cheesecake Factory's marsala sauce.

I've tried a lot of chicken marsala recipes as it is one of my favorite dishes. This recipe is very good and different in that the soup makes a really thick and rich sauce. I added mushrooms and onions. If you want a quick chicken marsala, try this one!

I combine this recipe with "Easier Chicken Marsala" on this site. I think this recipe deserves 4 stars because I love the can of soup! I also include some rosemary and I add beef broth as necessary to thin out the marsala gravy/glaze. And TONS of sauteed sliced mushrooms & onions. It really is so good over angel hair pasta. Also - the ingredients say 1 1/4 cups wine, but the directions only call for 1/2 a soup can of wine. I personally like about 3/4 cup.

This was pretty good for being so easy.
However, I coated the chicken in flour & simple seasonings before browning (copied from another chicken marsala recipe)--not sure if that made a huge difference or not.

I disagree with the other reviewers.  This is simply chicken with cream of mushroom soup poured over the top.  This wasn't bad just bland and its just soup over chicken.

This is a solid 4.5 star recipe.  I added  a 8 oz. carton of sliced, sauteed  mushrooms, and some rosemary and oregano to the sauce.    I also pounded my chicken breasts to tenderize them. This recipe is simple, tastes good, and is lowfat, whats not to like!

Very easy recipe.  I like to add onions and mushrooms (and sometimes other veggies I've got around the house) to make it a bit more substantial.  It's not the absolute best chicken marsala I've ever had, but it's certainly fast and easy, which more than makes up for any other shortcomings.

I love this sooo much! I did embellish a bit the second time I made this. I added alittle chicken broth, a bit of double cream ( or whipping cream) and I sauted some cut up white mushroon in butter. I served it sauted French beans and garlic, Parsnip smashed gold potatoes. Fabulous meal better that a resturant!!!!!! When I have time I will submit the entire meal as I did it.

After making some changes this is the best recipe I've found for Chicken Marsala and believe me, I've tried a few.  I sauted fresh mushrooms, onions & garlic in 1 tbl reduced fat margarine and about 1/4 cup of chicken broth until tender.  I removed that from the pan.  I then seasoned some flour with salt & pepper and dredged the chicken tenders.  I heated up about 1/4 cup of chicken broth with the pan drippings and added the tenders.  Cooked turning a few times while the broth evaporated.  I then added the mushroom mixture and the 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup mixed with the marsala.  Covered and simmered for about 20 minutes.  The chicken was so tender and the sauce was delicious over good rice.  Thank you so much for this great recipe!

I was excited to find an easier recipe for Chicken Marsala, but was very disappointed with the taste.  It was so salty! (And, I didn't put any in.)  All that Marsala was not enough to drown out the salty canned soup taste.  In fact, the canned soup taste drowned out the marvelous Marsala.  This is not a keeper.

I have made this excellent and QUICK recipe a few times.  Really good as written, but better with the following modifications:  Flatten/tenderize chicken breasts so that they are 1/2" thick.  Mix marsala and golden mushroom soup together before pouring over chicken breasts. Add sliced muchrooms and chopped green onion as suggested by others.  I serve over homemade egg noodles - DELICIOUS!  Whole family loves it!

Very good for such an easy, fast recipe.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Also, next time, I will pound the chicken breasts before cooking.

Holy smokes this is fantastic!  Chicken marsala is my favorite dish to order at an italian restaurant, and this is a great, easy dish that tastes just like it does when you eat out!  EVERYONE had seconds.  I served it with mashed potatoes, but I think it will be great with some penne.  THANK YOU!

Do not, as I did, sub in Red wine! I knew Marsala to be red, and didn't read carefully that I could use white or sherry. My version was a 1-star, which I continue to debate if I should toss it, but I will not hurt the ratings because of my own poor judgement. Mine tasted like a lot of cooked red wine with red pieces of chicken floating in it. Yuck.

I am giving the recipe 4 stars because I thought the Marsala wine was a bit much. I believe 1/2 c. Is plenty. I also mixed in mushrooms in  & this was delicious. My husband said he could eat this every night.

Eh... the chicken came out good (it was moist and tasty), but the sauce was a little too sweet. Next time, instead of making something quick, I'd rather put the time in and make the regular Chicken Marsala.

This dish is amazingly easy and fast to make. It was absolutely delicious. I served it over spaghetti squash which soaked up the gravy and was quite tasty. A definite keeper which I'll be making regularly.

I tried this recipe last night for dinner and it was so easy and so delicious.  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and a cooking white wine instead of what was listed because that was what I had on hand.  Thanks, Susan for posting this recipe-I'll be putting this into my regular meal rotation!

Really fast and easy !   1) Definately extra mushrooms are a must. 2) Found this to be a little on the salty side so the 2nd time making it, I used unsalted butter and it helped. 3) The 2nd time I made this, I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce

Yummy! I made this for dinner tonight, I used only about 3/4 cup cooking marsala wine, with about 1 1/2 tsp sugar(I like my marsala sauce a bit sweeter) I browned my chicken (which I cut up in smaller pieces) in butter & olive oil, while the chicken was browning in a separate pan i sauteed about 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms in butter with 1/4 chopped red onion,then In with the chicken added blk pepper the cooked mushrooms & onions (with juices)& soup, covered & simmered till done, then stirred in about 1 tbls of 1/2 & 1/2  and  served over hot linguine. My husband said it was as good as hes had in any restaurant, & I must agree it was delicious & will make again & again.

Super! Delicious! I added sautee'd onions, garlic and mushrooms, took one reviewer's suggestion to mix together Goldern Mushroom soup with Marsala wine. Then also added about 2Tsp of cornstarch mixed with 2Tbsp. of half & half (didn't have Heavy Cream), poured that in, let it bubble a few minutes, covered. Voilla!! Yummy!!

My whole family loved this meal. Including my 2 year old son who never sits down for a meal. I didn't change a thing. I always give the recipe a try before altering. This recipe needs NO changes. A good low-fat, low-cal recipe the whole family can enjoy!

This was pretty good for how easy it is!  I would say you could do with about half the marsala- it was a strong flavor.  I put the chicken breasts, mushroom soup, and marsala wine in the crop pot for 4.5 hrs on low.  With about 2 hours left, I addedd sliced mushrooms and onions.  I served over whole wheat pasta.  I will try again with less marsala and maybe some added seasonings.

This was very good. I'd give it five stars except that I did a few things differently. First, because we have a dairy intolerance, I made a cream of chicken/mushroom soup using coconut milk (which I did for the first time and it turned out quite well!). The soup was seasoned with fresh garlic, onion powder, pepper and paprika. I also seasoned the chicken with pepper, oregano and garlic salt, per another recipe (well, I added the garlic salt on my own). I did not use as much wine as is called for in this recipe - about 1/2 cup or so. But even so, once the soup was made, I just browned the chicken, poured wine and soup over it and simmered for 1/2 hour. I served it over rice. Very good. It was a hit with the family and I will definitely make this again.

Changed the recipe a bit, but it was very tasty and so easy!   Sauteed mushrooms, garlic and shallots after browning chicken, deglazed pan with dry vermouth (1 1/2 cups) and used regular cream of mushroom soup.  Will definitely make again!

I gave it 4 stars because without the changes I ended up making it would be too bland for my taste :)

I cubed my chicken and put it in a ziploc baggie with flour, salt, garlic powder and pepper. Then I sauteed the chicken in the butter until almost done. The rest I did exactly as the recipe calls for. I still ended up needing to salt my sauce after I put it over pasta, but my husband is not a big salt fan so it was perfect for his taste. The thing I liked about the flour coating was that it thickened up the sauce just slightly. Otherwise this recipe was really great, super easy and my whole family (even the picky ones) loved it!! Thanks for posting!

I haven't made this yet, but definetly will, sounds so good. I've made Chicken Marsala before but lost the recipe so thank you. Oh and I might add, you absolutley have to use the Marsala wine, that's what makes it so good, but using the Golden Mushroom soup, yummm and what a time saver. Thanks again Susan.

Really simple, really quick, and really tasty.  I would recommend seasoning the cutlets with salt and pepper before sauteing them or add salt and pepper when you add the other ingredients in.  Without the seasoning, it may be slightly bland.  I also added in sliced mushrooms and onion.  It makes a lot of sauce, so it goes great on top of angel hair or spaghetti.

I am not one to write reviews but this was the best/easiest dish I have ever made!!!  No need to go  out to out anymore when I crave chicken marsala =)  One addition I did was cooked sliced mushrooms separately on a skillet with salt and pepper and add it to the sauce.

This was so easy and very good. I improved it a bit by adding 1/2 a onion diced and sauted with fresh sliced mushrooms and 2 finely chopped garlic cloves. I cut down on the marsala wine and added a little chicken broth and about a 1/4 cup heavy cream. It was very worthy of dinner guest! I served it  with sauted french green beans and Ukon gold garlic mashed potatoes.

I used chicken tenderloins and it was so easy and very quick.  I was not expecting this to taste exactly like the chicken marsala that you get in a great Italian restaurant, but it is a great home version and a real time saver.  I did use just half the marsala and it was still very good.

OMG, unbelievable!! And,it's so quick and easy to make! The few minor tweaks I made were, I add some crushed garlic to the pan when browning the chicken, and I don't add the mushrooms until the last time that I turn the chicken over. We like to serve this over Angel hair pasta, so we use a little more Marsala wine & sherry, still keeping the ratio 2:1, and add a little flour the last few minutes of cooking to thicken up the sauce. I've made it several times for company, and they rave about it. Your guests will be salivating as the gourmet smell fills the air. Prepare for the compliments, even though you didn't actually slave over this dish!

Sauteed onions & fresh mushrooms with dried thyme and garlic. Browned the chicken. Set aside on a plate. Deglazed the pan with a little chicken broth and added the soup and marsala mixture. Added chicken & mushroom mixture and simmered for 20 mins. We had it with peas and couscous made with a little garlic, onion powder and parsley. Delicious. Nice, quick version. Even the kids liked it!

Very good considering how simple it was to make. I opted to add a med onion, a large fist full of mushrooms, and 3 cloves of garlic. Next time I will use chicken tenderloins or cut the breast into strips.

I have tried a few different chicken Marsala recipes and this one is FANTASTIC! I added some fresh garlic, mushrooms and onions with the chicken, but other than that I followed the recipe. Not only is this delicious, it's also very inexpensive, can be made on the healthier side if you so choose and is VERY easy. This will be a staple in our home for a long, long time!

This dish was absolutely delicious! I used regular cream of mushroom rather than golden mushroom (didn't have any) but it was amazing. Super fast. I sauteed fresh shrooms in minced garlic and a smidge of olive oil before adding them. This is a keeper and so easy for weeknights!

This was wonderful. We did add sliced onions and sliced mushrooms and substituted Merlot wine instead of Marsala. We served it over spagettini. Great go to dish.

Added fresh mushroom slices, red onion, garlic, thyme, rosemary, and accidentally baking powder instead of corn starch to thicken. Still turned out great!   next time - serve with angel hair pasta

I'm not quite sure what the other reviewers really liked about this recipe.  It was just okay for me.  It seemed pretty bland.  I agree with another reviewer that it really just tasted like chicken with golden mushroom soup.   I would be more inclined to go the extra steps and make the other versions on this site.  It definitely was a very quick chicken dish though.

I followed the ingredients as listed on the recipe and added a variety of fresh mushrooms. I cooked in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high. The chicken was tasty and fall apart tender however, it was lacking something in flavor. Very easy to prepare with hardly any clean-up therefore, it gets a four star rating.

This recipe was delicious...I made a few changes tho. I didn't have any marsala wine available so I substituted Chablis instead.. I also sauteed some onions and mushrooms...the last five minutes or so I uncovered it and added some heavy whipping cream and a little cornstarch to thicken it...I served this over egg noodles and my picky husband tore it up :):):)

Quick, tasty recipe! I serve it over egg noodles. I also add a whole carton of fresh mushrooms and I use chicken tenders instead of breasts. The tenders are easier to cut up and makes it easier to get a bite of chicken with each bite of pasta.

This is superb .The Marsala wine makes it a hit with the rich mushroom soup.I don't know what other people were eating (1*) but this was as good as restaurant fare any time. I like it with sautéed fresh mushrooms and onions with a little smashed garlic

Yum! Great very quick recipe.  I rated it a four only because I would add a couple things to spice it up a bit.  First I saute scallions then mushrooms and then add the chicken and when the chicken is browned I add thyme and a small amount of rosemary.

This is so good I would eat it every day. Then again anything with wine in it Im a big fan. Not a hit with the kid, she said the sauce was "funny". This is so fast and easy I keep the ingredients on hand so when I dont know what to make, I make this.

What a great recipe for one of my favorite dishes.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and onion powder, and added a splash of marsala wine during browning. Then I added 1 small can of sliced mushrooms (drained).  This is the easiest recipe to make for a great dish.

I love chicken marsala, but the version I make is pretty time consuming so I thought this was great for a quick chk. marsala. I also used the crockpot and it was really good the chk. was tender. Added mushrooms and onions, more marsala and chk. broth. I like lots of sauce and then served it over potatoes.

I'd have to say this recipe is AWESOME!  It's super easy and quick to make, and comes out tasting like you did WAY more work than you actually did.  I sliced and sauteed a carton of fresh gourmet mushrooms in butter and then added them to the marsala sauce to soak up the flavor.  To Rachel1070, the trick to this recipe is to mix the marsala wine and golden mushroom soup until it's fully incorporated.  Also, flip the chicken breasts every 5 mins or so, so that they soak up the sauce.  I topped each breast off with a medallion of goat's cheese before pouring the marsala sauce over top.  Served with salad and bread with dipping oil and spices, this is the PERFECT "impress 'em with minimal effort" dish!!

This was a very good and easy meal.  Very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, I just added a can of sliced mushrooms.   This is one of my husband's favorite dishes, being that I never tasted this dish before I went with my hubby's 4 star rating.  My 4 year even ate it and asked for more, and I have a very hard time getting her to eat any type of meat!

Awfully tasty. Definitely do a few things though - pound the chicken, or even better, by the thin cut chicken to keep it "quick." The sauteed mushrooms and onions really add to the recipe. Try serving it over baked spaghetti squash - yummy, and it's your vegetable. Enjoy!

Loved this recipe. So easy & it tastes very similar to the $15 a plate dinner at a local restaurant. I added fresh mushrooms & thickened the sauce with 1 1/2 tbsp. cornstarch I served with garlic mash potatoes & green beans. Great meal! Thanks for the great recipe

I have never had chicken Marsala, much less made it, so my review isn't based on how "true" this recipe is to the dish, it's based on the taste and the ease of making it. Well, it tasted really good, and was very easy to make. I didn't have Marsala wine though, so I used a Sangiovese I had on hand. This may have made it a little too fruity, but it was still very good. Like many other reviewers, I added about a dozen sliced mushrooms, and some sliced shallots; both are definitely a must for this dish! I served it over egg noodles, which were the perfect match. This was a really good quick and easy after work dinner. Thanks! Oh, and for those who wondered why the ingredient list calls for more Marsala than the directions do, I think the rest is intended for drinking! :-)

With all there is to do this time of year, I think a lot of us are looking for quickie dinners. I didn't have any chicken in the house, so I made turkey burgers, covered them with the sauce, let them simmer for about thirty minutes and topped with provolone cheese. Wonderful tasting sauce Susan and no one knew half of it came from a can! Thanks so much!

This was really good, easy & quick.  I'd tried a version with the cream of mushroom soup.  Golden Mushroom gives a much better flavor.  Also, I added a can of mushrooms & chopped up an onion and browned it with the chicken.

I’m not a good cook at all!  But this recipe is super easy & delicious!  I add fresh mushrooms and serve it with mixed veggies & risotto rice (from a box).  My husband and very picky 3y/o loved it & clean their plates!  My 3y/o told me “mommy this is delicious! Good job!”  Ive made it a few times just to make sure and everyone still loves it! SUCCESS!!!

I added some freshly chopped mushrooms and onions as suggested by other reviewers. This recipe was meh. Not great, but not bad. It didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. I'm glad I tried it, but I probably won't make it again.

This was a  great quick and tasty recipe. The only things I did different was to dreadge the chicken in almond flour before browning and added just a little onion powder, salt and pepper. The Marsala wine made it lightly sweet and gives the mushroom soup a different dimension of flavor. My pickiest eater even enjoyed it.

5 stars! I seasoned the chicken with a some salt and pepper before browning.  This recipe is so incredibly simple but packs so much taste!  Will absolutely make this again.  Something the recipe doesn't indicate is that you have to remove the lid at some point to let the sauce thicken.  Next time, I'll time it better so that the chicken doesn't overcook.  Excellent flavor!  Photos added.

This was pretty tasty. I did add some basil, oregano and thyme for some extra flavor. Next time I think I will use less Marsala wine as I think there was too much, which made the sauce runny.

surprisingly very good! my husband really loved it, and it seemed like it was way more work then it was. I let the chicken cook in the sauce for about 30 min, and it was actually still juicy! Maybe it was because of the flour dredging??
I added some sauted oinions and fresh mushrooms along with some garlic powder(that goes in everything tho).
Quick. Easy. Will surely be making again!

Very tasty! I used only 1/2 cup marsala, and others did in the reviews. Chopped up some mushrooms, potatoes, and bell peppers to simmer with the chicken.

This was so tasty and easy!  I lightly floured and seasoned the chicken before cooking it in olive oil (rather than butter).  I also had sherry on hand, so I used that instead of marsala...I guess I actually made sherried chicken. Added a handful of sliced mushrooms, and it was fantastic! I served it over egg noodles to my husband and 3 year old son.  Both thought it was "yummy".

this was super easy to make, only thing I thought was wrong with it was that it had to much marsala wine in it, family said it had a twang to it.  I will make again and cut the marsala wine down. I also add fresh mushroom other than that it tasted fantastic!

Very good, super fast.  If I make this again I will add the wine towards the end so I can taste it more strongly, I think some of the flavor cooked out, maybe I should use a better marsala?  Will make again!

I made this recipe for a large party,  everyone loved it.  I did saute fresh mushrooms in butter first, them removed them and set a side.  then I dredged thin sliced chicken in flour,  added more butter to pan cooked chicken until golden, removed chicken and set aside with mushrooms. Adding soup, chicken stock and marsala cooking wine  to taste and then put mushrooms and chicken back in  pan.  I did use a very large frying pan. This dish is fantastic.

This was good for a quick & easy meal, exactly what I expected.  A good "go-to" meal, but of course nothing like a gourmet chicken marsala.

This recipe is so easy and very tasty.  It tastes as though much more work has gone into it than really does.  My kids (4 & 7) both loved it and they are pretty picky eaters.  I didn't have Marsala wine, so substituted some Merlot that I had open.  Other than that, it needed nothing else.    I recommend to anyone looking for a quick, easy meal!

THANK YOU!!!  I've tried dozens of recipes, and eaten it at lots of restaurants, and for as easy, quick and inexpensive this one is, it's GREAT.  I experimented a little - 2 cloves of garlic, and I did dredge the chicken in flour, but with the basic recipe, you can produce a meal better than most restaurants serve you, and at about a quarter of the price.  I like lots of mushrooms with my marsala, but using mushroom soup is a stroke of genius.  Thanks again.

We liked this recipe a lot and have made it twice now.  We didn't use the fresh mushrooms or onions, but I am sure that would make it even better.  This is one of my daughter's favorites!

I'm sorry to say, this was not good.  We couldn't even eat it.  I've made real marsala sauce and this was no where near. I think maybe it's the amount marsala wine, too much?? I'm a fan of golden mushroom soup and have made delicious meals with it, but this was not one of them.  But thank you anyway ;)

This is good, but not THAT much different than plain cream of mushrooms soup chicken.  Very easy though and a good quick weeknight dinner.  Definitely need to add fresh mushrooms.

This was a good recipe and very quick. I could not find the golden mushroom soup, so I just used Campbell’s and it was fine. I also added a container of fresh mushrooms & 1 large onion. I recommend using a large skillet and maybe sautéing the mushrooms first. I will make again. Thanks.

A great, quick meal that tastes very similar to the chicken marsala that I've "slaved" over.  Big hit with the family.  Good enough for company...a keeper!

I tried it with margarine (ICBINB), added some extra garlic and used skinless boneless chicken thighs instead. IT WAS FANTASTIC. The chicken was moist and tender.. I also added more Marsala wine and omitted the sherry.

This recipe was easy-had to go to two stores to find the golden mushroom soup-served with whole wheat pasta (which my husband loves) and added sauteed baby bella mushrooms for a little more flavor and elegance.

Tasted so good! I used a can of 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup but only used 1 cup of the marsala wine and it was still very flavorful. I added broccoli and cauliflower to the dish. Definitely make again.

Excellent, especially considering the amount of work involved.  I added an onion with the chicken and used a bit extra marsala because I like the sauce thinner.  The kids loved it.

Had some chicken breasts I didn't know what to do with so I looked and found this recipe.  The family loves it!  So much that they put the sauce on their veggies that were the side dish.

Some things I did a little different.
1)  I added fresh mushrooms and onion while I was browning the chicken.
2)  After a 20 minute simmer, the marsala sauce was not at the consistency I wanted.   The chicken was done, so I pulled it out of the heat and blasted the sauce on high until it thickened up.  If you do this, make sure you stir constantly to not burn the sauce.
3)  I'm not a wine expert, so i just picked up a bottle of white wine that I liked from the 'fridge and used it.

Very nice recipe! I topped it with some motzza and a little parmesean cheese. I also mixed some finley minced onion and a little crushed garlic into the soup mixture. Very tasty over pasta! :)

I'm giving it two stars because it was at the least, edible. I was very disappointed in this recipe, especially since it was so highly rated by everyone. I put in 6 whole breasts as directed, and it was too much chicken for the sauce, so I added another can of soup...and even with the extra soup there was still too much wine. And I don't know why you would tell someone 1-1/4 cups of wine, and then later on tell them 1/2 soup can. Someone needed to make a decision on which one it should be.

One of the easiest and best chicken marsala recipes! The consistency of the sauce is one I kept trying to achieve but the golden mushroom soup delivers. I added about 8 ounces of mushrooms and a little Italian seasoning to the chicken but everything else was perfect. Add a bit of fresh parsley before serving and your guests will be most impressed!!

Good basic recipe for marsala. I add garlic and mushrooms to it and also thin out the soup with some chicken broth.  Easy to make and it freezes well.
