This was really good.  My husband, who usually prefers his soups hot and spicy, commented that although it's not spicy, it was a "nice change."  The taste is mild, but the garlic and onion are plenty to flavor this.  I used probably 5 garlic cloves because we love garlic, and the taste was still not overpowering.

This recipe is amazing! I added a little cheddar cheese and some cayenne pepper and it was perfect. Great great flavor. One of my favorite soups so far, very filling!

This turned out bland.  Had to add quite a bit of salt.  It might be better with cheddar cheese.

We loved this and even used milk instead of half-and-half because that's what we had on hand. Great texture and flavor. Thanks!

This was a good soup.  I liked that it wasn't full of butter and cream.  The barley was great and gave the soup something chewy.  It makes a lot!  Half it.

Only made half quantity of this so therefore only used the chicken broth and everything else was the same.  Mother LOVED it but I didn't try it as I pureed it with an immersion blender as Mother has difficulty swallowing and it didn't look as appealing to me.  But she had seconds!  : )

I love the texture of the barley, and the broth is delightfully different than the standard soups I make. Hubby loves it!

This was delicious.  I added a little bit of ground red pepper to spice it up a bit!  YUM!

We did not like this soup.  It was a very unappetizing  color and the flavor was just not there

This is going to be my cream of broccoli soup recipe from now on! I omitted the mushrooms and added carrots with the broccoli.  You could definitely use milk instead of half and half.

Excellent soup! My family loved it and it was super easy to make. I used quick cooking barley and skipped the first half hour of cooking. I threw the broccoli and barley in together and cooked for 10 min. Thx for the recipe! It's a keeper!

I make this regularly saut√©ing carmelized shallots, lots of garlic and all of the spices together first. Then some diced potatoes and then follow the rest of the recipe as is. Filling, fresh, delicious, healthy.

Great comfort food!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except for subbing in reconstituted dried mushrooms for the fresh ones, and adding more milk instead of all half and half.

I didn't care for this. Rosemary was way too strong.
