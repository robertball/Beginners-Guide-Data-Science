This was the first time I have prepared cornish hens. I liked the flavor and was so easy. The "glaze" you brush on hens was quite runny; not a glaze at all. Overall, this was a flavorful and easy weeknight dinner. Thanks!

This was very good and easy.

I did modify the glaze however, I added a tablespoon of dark brown sugar, then cooked it down in a sauce pan. 

The brown sugar and cooking it down turns it into a glazing sauce before adding to the chicken.

If you reduce the glaze in a sauce pan first it comes out nice.I also recommend  seasoning your hens with s@p but thats just me. Overall easy recipe that came out delicious

I used this recipe for a package of chicken thighs and it worked great!  Modifications:  a) I had a dozen thighs, so ingredients x 4; b) I marinated the thighs overnight in the sauce - no need to baste during cooking; c) I saved the marinade and boiled it down for 10 min (important to kill bacteria) and added a cornstarch slurry to make a gravy.  With rice and veggies, it was a bit hit for dinner!

Didn't have cornish hen, so tried it on four chicken wings.  Delicious! Scarfed them down at an embarrassingly fast rate.

I found the "glaze" did not make any difference to the taste. However, when I tried the leftovers cold (with skin removed) I found the soy sauce had taken over the flavour. won't make this again.

This was tender and juicy. The taste was great. I would add a little seasoning to the hens first next time but overall really good!

Not to my liking. Maybe better if vinegar amt reduced by half or quarter and honey increased somewhat.

It turned out good and cooked perfectly. Next time I would add some seasoning to the cavity, maybe even marinate for a short time, because the meat under the skin didn't have any flavor.

I didn't have soy sauce. But I followed the rest and the taste was still great.  It was a little runny. But . I'm sure the next time I make it I can alter it to make less runny.

This was fairly easy to make the “glaze” was too runny. I like the taste the orange flavor was really nice. I will make this again, but I will marinate the hens first.

This is amazing and so easy.  I did take some comments in to consideration before trying it.  I added some Johnny Seasoning before the first stage of baking and then also added 1 Tbsn of brown sugar to the glaze and cooked it down.  Made a wonderfully yummy glaze!  I've cooked a lot of hens, but this was the best.

not really a "glaze", more watery, which doesn't stick to the chicken. Chicken didn't really have much flavor, just meat. Wouldn't recommend.
