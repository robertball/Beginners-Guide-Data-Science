Great recipe! I had two people from India helping me make it and they suggested these changes: more curry (they added about 8 tbls), fresh ground pepper, and use Indian Chili powder not cayenne and increase the amount to about 3 tsp. They said that cayenne is a western spice and Indian chili powder is more authentic. This made it VERY hot. We used the sauce to help spice up another mild curry dish we had.

I used this recipe when I made curry myself for the first time ever. I loved it! Absolutely wonderful. 

Having experimented with the recipe since that first experience, I suggest trying out a different first step. 

In a dry pot pre-heated to a medium heat, first roast the curry powder for a minute or until browned, stirring constantly. Add the paprika and the cinnamon, and ginger stirring constantly. (I do not add the sugar) Then add the garlic, bay leaf, and onions, and drizzle the olive oil over top. You can do this with about 1 1/2- 2tbsp. of olive oil. Continue as per the recipe. 

I found that that extra first step enriches the flavor of the curry powder and makes for a fuller-bodied/ slightly spicier curry. 

Amazing recipe and I will definitely use it again and again! - Nadia

This whole recipe is upside down.  First of all you need to fry the whole spices. Use vegetable oil for Indian cooking, you want the oil to taste of these spices, not olives!. It is the taste of the spices in the oil (whether whole or ground), that seperates high quality fare from stuff in glass jars and plastic packets.  Use 1" cinnamon stick instead of ground cinnamon, taste is far superior, put this in with the bay leaf (though 2 is probably better) and if you want more taste, 4 or 5 bruised cardomoms and a couple of cloves. All these need to go straight into very hot oil, the spices will pop and splutter and release their flavours into the oil. Should only need a minute or so, but if you have heat too low you will need to use your nose!.  Next add onion, garlic and ginger together, this will stop the garlic and ginger from tasting raw and allow them to release their flavours. Lower the heat, but still keep it medium high.  Once onion etc is done add ground spices, let them touch the bottom of the hot pan (stirring), they will brown somewhat and they won't taste raw, do this for about a minute (again, use your nose!). Do the same for the tomato puree, it browns, taste improves.  I would let the yoghurt integrate and cook a bit before adding the coconut milk. I don't why you would need to remove the bay leaf...  The above..frying spices etc is Indian food 101 and can be used in all recipes and will produce "that" taste you are after (spices integrated into the oil!).

This is probably the best curry I've had in a long long long LONG time. My alterations are:

1/4 cup curry powder - I love the taste!
1/2 tsp cinnamon
3/4 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp chilli flakes
1/2 red bell pepper
1/2 cup pineapple tidbits

I used a whole can of coconut milk because I didn't have yogurt. I also added about 1/4 cup low fat sour cream to make it a bit creamier. I served it on Jasmine rice. All I can say is that this is amazing!! If I could rate it 100 stars, I would.

I did not care for this recipe. My husband is Indian and he took one bite and was done. I have been cooking Indian for 14 years and this is not it. I will continue with my in-laws' version instead. I will post that recipe soon. Sorry to leave negative feedback.

A very nice Chicken Curry.  I also used 1 tsp. of Garam Masala.  I wish I had left out the lemon and the cayenne because I thought it tasted better before those were added.  I even cut down the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. because my youngest daughter doesn't like it too hot.  I think that next time I will omit the last two ingredients.

My wife and I love this one and make it all the time. Use more chicken / curry though or it is pretty mild.   Special thanks to the person who wrote "my husband had one bite and was done." I used to have trouble finding this recipe but now I just google that line and it takes me right here!

My first comment is to read through the rest of the reviews before making this dish.  The recipe alone is a great starting place, but you may want to take some of the suggestions you read to make it just right for you.  Not everyone likes the same flavors, so you need to tweak it specifically for your taste buds.  Thanks everyone for making this dish a perfect one for me!!!

OMG--this is sooooo good!  I added 2 small potatoes, peeled and cubed, and 1/2 cup of peas; also sprinkled cilantro on just before serving.  Didn't have yogurt, so I just used a full can of coconut milk.  I would give this 100 stars if I could.  A must if you like Indian food.

This was my first attempt ever at curry.  I chose a recipe with ingredients that I might be able to use outside of the recipe.  This recipe did that and allowed me to modify it slightly so that my 4 year old could eat it.  I added a potato and cubed butternut squash.  I decided that after these additions, you really could have done without the chicken and had a vegetarian dish.  I ended up adding 2 cans of coconut milk (the light kind) and the consistency was absolutely perfect! I DID need to simmer it for about an extra 20-30 minutes for the potatoes, but it didn't affect the consistency of the other veggies at all!  This was a HUGE hit!  Oh, I left out the cayenne to eliminate the spice and it ended up needing a little salt.

I just cooked this and im only 20 and this was the first time I tried cooking something that didnt involve a microwave, a jar or a packet and I must say it was one of the best currys I've ever ate. Just a shame I had a fight with my dad since he tried taking over and was putting in too much ginger, so he went to bed and refused to eat any. My mam loved it as much as me though :) One thing I would say is I used the 4-6 serving recipe size ie one cup of yogurt and it barely filled half the plate and other half was chips. That was 2 generous servings. I guess if you are putting it on a bed of rice then maybe it would fill 4.

Thanks anyway im gonna cook this for my friends next!


I just cooked this again. This is a few months on since last time but this time I worked out what a cup is in metric. So I used the proper measurements which worked out as 16 tablespoons for 1 cup. Now this made 3 large servings but I think I preffered it with less yogurt and coconut milk making it thicker and more concentrated. I think last time I probably used around 12 tablespoons of yogurt and 9 of coconut milk. It was still a very nice curry with this extra stuff but I definetly preffered it before.

I really enjoyed this dish.  It may not become your favorite dish ever but if you are looking for a tasty exotic, yet easy dish one night, try this!  A few changes I made...cut the cinnamon in half (I can't help but associate cinnamon with dessert). Fortunately, you cannot identify the spice in this dish.  It blends nicely.  I also used the entire can of coconut milk because I like a lot of sauce.  I let it simmer a little (without the lid) to thicken.  Lastly, I added red bell pepper, frozen peas and left the cayenne out.  We also ate this with saffron rice, as another person recommended.  Good choice.  Enjoy.

Love this recipe, my husband and I really enjoy it and it is very similar to what you can buy at a restaurant (but this is a fraction of the cost). I have made this several times and here are a few things I have learned as it took me about 3 times to perfect it. FOR A SMOOTHER SAUCE (no graininess) 1. Be sure to prepare everything in advance. I suggest measuring all your spices and putting them in a small bowl. Get everything cut up before you heat the oil to brown the onions. If you don't, by the time you get done measuring more of the oil gets absorbed and when you add the spices it gets really dry. 2. Another trick I did, was to add the onions later. My husband is very picky about chunks of onions in food (he loves the flavor, not the crunch), so I took mine with part of yogurt and pulvarized them in the food processor. I just browned the garlic (put the ginger in too). This also made it when I added the spices it never got dry. 3. Finally, I think what truly made the biggest difference is this time I simmered this for almost an hour total. I think the longer it simmers, smoother the sauce as well. After about 20 minutes my sauce also looked thin, but after I let it simmer longer the consistency was perfect! Just a few things to try if you happen to notice your sauce seems a little "grainy" as I thought mine was slightly the first time I tried this! Also, if you want it even hotter just add more cayanne pepper, or even let people spring a little more on their own afte

I am not entirely sure what is going wrong with some of these reviews. I have several Indian friends and have eaten their curry many times. This tastes very much like the 'authentic' curries from their kitchens. I do add at least twice as much curry powder as is called for. Perhaps the wrong curry powder is the issue. I suggest buying from the "international" aisle or making your own mix from one of the recipes on this site. Also, please be aware that curries are very region specific. If this doesn't taste like the curry you love then it may be from the wrong region.

My husband and I love curry, so I have tried many different curry recipes. This one is by far the best curry and will be my standard curry recipe from now on. I usually have to tweak recipes to suit our tastes, but I don't change a thing on this one.

as many other cooks said, this is a great BASE recipe to play with.  i used a lot more curry and garlic, diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, no coconut milk, and no bay leaf. i reduce the cinnamon and the sugar substantially.  i like lentils in carrots in it, personally.   i start mine HOURS before i want to eat it, so that it melds more.  the yogurt only goes in the last 10 minutes or so.  i think if you're going to make this, you want to take your time and taste as you go.  
i haven't found a better BASE recipe.

It was a decent recipe, I added green cardamoms, powder ginger instead of fresh, I used skinned  chicken thighs cut in half, half a small can of tomato sauce and one chicken bouillon, 1 table spoons turmeric. I didn't use as much yogurt, perhaps 1/2 cup, also I added a little bit more sugar (~3 tablespoons) it didn't make it sweet. It was delicious! Even my kids ate it.

Check out the other reviews as this recipe does need some tweaking. My suggestions are to either half or completely take out the lemon juice. The recipe was going awesome until I added the lemon juice and it completely drowned out all the other ingredients. That is the most important thing to change in my opinion.  Other suggestions: 3 Chicken breast halves instead of two. double ALL dry ingredients or choose depending on personal tastes. Then use double the coconut milk.  I can't emphasize enough how important reducing the lemon juice is!  With that adjustment alone this is a five star recipe. I'm actually being too generous with four stars as it isn't very good if you don't make any adjustments to the lemon juice.

I Googled and found this recipe, Just Finished making it, WOW WOW..YUMMMM.....I am loving it... I find if you are a good cook and follow recipe ingredients, put your own little spin on it, like if yOu would like more chicken just add ingredients to suit your own taste, Came out perfect, better than paying $15.00 to $23.00 in Indian Restaurants, plus you have left overs....lol....l also added baked and browned cubed potatoes...YUM....That with Nan Bread its a meal fit for a king and queen....lol...See My Picture....ChefDAwn.

PS: Instead of using Cubed Chicken Breast, I used legs and thighs, I cut the stick  part off chicken legs and just leave the drum....However to each his or her own, Next time I make this recipe, I will add mushrooms....YUM

This is a good base recipe I've made it many times and here's what I do.  First I brown the chicken. Remove it from the pan drain fat if necessary. Then I add the onions and garlic. Sauté for a couple minutes. The next step is key. Brown the spices!  Move the onions over in the pan and toast the spices for a minute. Watch carefully as they will burn easily. Add the tomato paste and let that toast up for a couple minutes.  I add a little white wine (maybe not authentic but I like it). Then yogurt and coconut milk. I then add the chicken to the pan and let simmer for half an hour, stirring occasionally  my hubby said its better than most Indian restaurants

Very nice recipe. However some suggestions:

1. use Muchi Curry
2. leave out the tomato sauce (makes it bitter)
3. use Thai brand coconut milk 
4. use 1 teaspoom tumeric for color and taste 
5. when curry mixture is boiling drop chicken in, boil for 5 minutes and turn off. The chicken will slow cook over 20 minutes and be tender. Do not boil the chicken for 20 minutes. The chicken will be very tough if you do.
5. also nice with home made fries: slice Yukon potatoes and fry in shallow olive oil in pan.
6. When you dump the spices onto the hot pan, roast them for 2 minutes, then add the coconut milk and yogurt. Use stiff yogurt.
7. Thicken with cornstarch if necessary.

I have made this over and over.  It is a family favorite.  Some changes I make: I toast the spices and coat the raw chicken and add half of the yogurt in a plastic bag and marinate for a couple of hours, I double the ginger (it's a favorite spice of ours), I don't use any additional curry since I buy high quality curry and it's plenty hot!  Also, I use the leftover coconut milk to make our rice.  It makes it nice and fluffy!

This recipe is delicious, but is missing a few ingredients. Here is my take on it. .
Sprinkle some of the spices on the chicken and let them marinate into the meat for at least 30 minutes.
Add one tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of olive oil to a pan and cook chicken till gold brown crust forms. This makes chicken taste better and also looks more appetizing. 
Add 1 tbsp of a knorr chicken bouillon to the sauce for better flavor. 
Continue to follow the recipe as instructed.
Serve over white rice with a side order of fried sweet(yellow) plantains. 
The combination of the sweet plantains and the spicy sauce with rice is absolutely delicious. Don't take it from me and try for yourself.

Very, very good. I browned the spices in a dry saute pan as another reviewer recommended. I remember seeing an Indian chef do this on tv. I also added julienned green and red peppers. This may not be authentic to classic Indian curry but I am sure that Indian housewives add their own touches to dishes too. Made it a bit more healthy and added color. I found that it needed some salt but curry powders vary so be sure to taste your sauce and adjust accordingly. I served it over Jasmine rice.

As an individual who has traveled throughout India and enjoys Indian cuisine immensely, I can honestly say anyone who likes this recipe has never eaten Indian food.  Not very good.

I really liked thisrecipe and thing it's a good base recipe that can be played around with. I changed the recipe some because of the ingredients I had on hand and will probably try it again next time with the listed ingredients. This time I used a little less cinnamon, ground ginger, no sugar (seemed a little off for me) 3 chicken breasts, 2 T of tomato paste, 2 T sour cream in place of yogurt (also used a whole can of coconut milk) and crushed pepper instead of cayenne. Hubby thought it was great and my 10 month old gobbled it right up! I served with Jasmine rice and garlic naan.

oh my gosh, this was so good. My family loved this. I served it with the indian yellow rice with saffron in it, and pita bread with homemade satsiki sauce. But I simmered a whole chicken, then deboned it, and added it to sauce and simmered as recipe said. My husband put his inside the pita bread for a sandwich effect. I highly recommend this recipe as well as the yellow rice with saffron!

Wonderful flavor! I omitted the last 5 ingredients because i didn't have them on hand, i just made a butter and flour roux and added water and a splash of milk. Next time i will add the coconut milk instead of the milk. I also increased the ginger, i grated 1 tsp instead of 1/2tsp. I am keeping this recipe and making this at least once a month. I served it with lentils and naan bread from this site.

More spiced than spicy, but they cayenne and lemon juice can be upped to suit your tastes. This was a very good dish that everyone enjoyed!

This recipe is delicious!
I've made this dish about 4 times now and with slight modifications.  The first time I made it I found the lemon to be way to overpowering and like a reviewer below, I felt that the curry tasted better before I added the lemon.  So I would advise either not adding the lemon or putting very little.  Also I mixed the curry powder, paprika, etc with about 2 tbsp of water before I added it to the pan.  I am Indian and this is what my family does to avoid the spices from burning.  Other than that it is an amazing delicious and simply recipe to make.

Absolutely delicious - will definitely make again.  Followed the recipe as closely as I could but did not have the bay leaf or the cayenne pepper and it was still fine.  I doubled the recipe because we like a lot of sauce, and it was the perfect amount.  I also added a bit more sugar (I guess about 1/4 cup) and that seemed to balance out the spiciness of the dish.  Served it with basmati rice and Naan bread.  Yummy!

***UPDATE***: Have made this many times now. I now use vanilla/mango yogurt as this adds a nice sweetness to the dish. I do not add the lemon and cayenne pepper at the end, and I have made it successfully without the tomato paste. Also, if you don't have fresh ginger, you can use powdered ginger if you have it. But fresh ginger is wonderful and if you buy it in bulk it is very inexpensive.

Fantastic!  This tastes just like it would at a good Indian restaurant.  I didn't have yogurt so I added more coconut milk and some water to make up for it, and it still tasted so good.  One great addition: a can of drained garbanzo beans makes it really hearty, almost like a stew.  I can't wait to have leftovers tonight!

I love this!! My first attempt at Curry and it has become a staple comfort food in my home. I do not like coconut so I omit the coconut milk and increase the yogurt and I like mine with a whole can of tomato paste (6 oz.).If you like things a little more spicy you can certainly turn up the heat with an increase in the cayenne. Also, this recipe can be duplicated with the use of Chinese curry powder too!

To me it doesn't matter if this is authentic or not, it's delicious.  My dad's side of the family is from India, and some like Indian food, some don't, but I have made this exact recipe for a lot of my family and have never had a complaint! It's delicious.  I have been making this for several years, the only change I make is adding a bit more curry powder and a little bit of garam masala.  One tip I have, get cup of yogurt out and let it sit at room temp, then take the pot off the stove and let your onion & spice mixture cool down, then gradually heat it back up while adding your yogurt. This keeps the yogurt from curdling, not a guarantee though!

I loved this recipe, and will make it in the future in lieu of purchasing store bought curry sauce. I did tweak the recipe a bit however, with the following: I used 3 cloves of garlic, a small red onion, ceylon cinnamon, hungarian sweet paprika, double the amount of ginger root, greek yogurt (it has a ton more protein than regular plain yogurt), double the coconut milk (I like a lot of liquid for the added steamed rice to soak up), zest from the lemon, and 1/3 cup chopped cilantro. Next time I will twek it further, as I never make the same thing the same way twice.

Warning - quite a few reviews advise adding lots more curry.  I took this advice without testing first and ended up with something disgusting!  I'll give this one another try and follow the recipe.  For now, I need to salvage something else for dinner. :-(

I am positively addicted to this dish-- when I first started making this for my boyfriend and I, we'd have it once a week. And I'd make extra to take it to work.  After reading some other reviews and playing around with the ingrediants, I now tend to add about 5 tsp curry, 1Tbsp or more of ginger, and a bit of garam masala.

I am going to go ahead and rate this 4 stars.  I really enjoyed this curry (along with the basmati rice and Naan which, by the way, I found at Wal-Mart!).  The leftovers are now in the freezer to enjoy at another time.  The reason for 4 stars is because I ended up adding a very good bit of honey to this recipe.  The curry was not sweet at all (is it supposed to be?).  For some reason I am under the impression that it should have a slightly sweet taste.  That is the reason I added the honey.  I will make this again with the honey mod.  =)

This dish was very good. I had to do a little tweaking to get it just right. Please note that I adjusted the serving size to 4 people vs. 8 people. I took LWELKNER's advice and added extra curry (9tbsp total) and substituted the cayenne for Indian chili powder. I used 1 can of coconut milk vs. 3/4 cup.  After browning the spices and onions, I suggest gradually adding one cup of water and stirring constantly as you would do with a roux. I would then add the coconut milk and yogurt. Bring to a boil and add the chicken pieces, reduce heat and simmer.  If the mixture is too thick for you, thin out with additional water (1/2 cup). I served this dish over Jasmine rice. Perfect and delicious!

AWSOME!!!! First thing...sooooo easy to make. Secondly, tons and tons of flavor. I added a full can of coconut milk, a heaping teaspoon of garam masala, and about 41/2 tablespoons of curry. Also added diced potatoes. Otherwise followed the recipe and my man couldn't stop eating it. He absolutely loved and so did my 19 month old girl. I did not add the cayenne pepper because of her though. Thank you so much for an awsome recipe.

I made this with great ingredients and followed it perfectly...it smelled soooo wonderful.  Kind of like a sented candle buring.  But it was horrible to the taste.  We had to throw the whole thing out.  I can see maybe some people liking it, but it wasn't our thing.

Yum!  I make this when I have a craving for Indian food.  I add about a teaspoon of garam masala for extra heat, and sometimes substitute the chicken for chickpeas.  I serve it with basmati rice.  It's also great as leftovers!

I doubled the cayenne because I like it hot, and added a can of chick peas at the end to feed a few more unexpectedly, and thought this was a very good curry recipe. Easy and quite delicious. I will make it again.

This is incredibly flavorful and extremely easy to make. I know curries can be intimidating due to lots of ingredients, but it seriously consists of throwing stuff in a pan, letting it cook, throwing more stuff in, letting it cook, etc etc. The end result is your friends/fam thinking you're a five star chef. This was so good. Heads up, you can use fat free yogurt (i just didn't have any full fat on hand) and it's still REALLY REALLY rich and good because of all the yummy coconut milk. You will not regret making this, f'real.

Great Recipe and super healthy.  Even the coconut milk has good saturated fats.  Only thing is that it could use a fresh green chili to make it a little spicy.

This was pretty good. Not to-die-for, but it was a nice meal and a lot cheaper than dining out. I used a full can of light coconut milk, 1/4 of curry (will try using more next time), greek yogurt, and then tossed in two cups of fresh, chopped spinach about ten minutes before it was done simmering.

Unless you prefer curry to be sour, bitter and so spicy your mouth hurts, you MUST alter this. I still reccomend using the recipe as a base though. Here's what I do: double the ginger, double the sugar, cut the paprika and cayenne in half, add a little more curry and cinnamon than it calls for, leave out the lemon juice, add some raisins

I did not like this recipe at all. I gave it two stars because there are ways you can save the dish, slightly. First off I would not put in the lemon! I added more tomatoe paste and canned tomatoes. More coconut milk, cinnamon, garam masala, and cumin. I added all these ingredients to taste and I found a better balance.

As a reviewer suggested, I toasted the spices, then added olive oil and onion. I also used the whole can of coconut milk, and added about 1/2 cup more yogurt. Sweetened with honey, and used a leftover diced baked sweet potato as well. Served over quinoa. Wonderful!

Very simple and tasty when you need a "curry fix".  I found the texture of the sauce a bit grainy, but it's not a huge drawback.  This recipe makes a lot of sauce so, if you're not into sopping it up with something, throw in twice the amount of chicken and stretch the dish.

Overall, this recipe is okay, considering ingredients you can and cannot get in the US.  There was way too much curry in this recipe...consulting cookbooks I brought back from living in Asia, for this amt. of chicken, 1 - 1.5 TABLESPOONS would be sufficient.  (Maybe it was supposed to be 3 TEAspoons???)  It made the consistency really grainy, and aftertaste bitter.

EXCELLENT!  Better than the restaurants I've been to.  Whole family raved over it.  Took the following suggestions from other reviewers: doubled sauce, added heaping tsp of garam masala, used vanilla yogurt (1/2c-3/4c instead of 1c) and left out sugar, added a little more coconut milk, used lime instead of lemon, used curry paste (6-8 Tbsp) instead of curry powder, and used Indian Chile powder in place of cayenne.  Served with Indian Rice (Pulao) and Pakistani Spicy Chickpeas (both recipes on this site) as well as store-bought naan.  We will be eating this often!  Thanks for the recipe Amanda!

My husband and I made this last night and it was fabulous!!  The only difference was that I added a bit more yogurt & tomato paste because I wanted extra sauce.  Very spicy, which was exactly what we wanted.  Now, only to learn how to make naan...

I definately think this has a good starting ground but it was too thick and I think that the fresh ginger it calls for might be too much...not sure can't put my finger on it.  I probably wouldn't add the tomato paste.  But I do think if tweaked this recipie could be killer but we really didn't like this one.

This was delicious.  I didn't have 3 tbsp of curry and it still came out awesome.  I added carrots and potatoes to the mix with great results.  The little I had left over was even better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my first dish to make with curry and it was really good. I've only eaten Indian food about twice ever, so I was leary about trying it. It's very tasty, just a *tad* of spicy, a touch of sweet, and a little tang from the lemon. Overall,  I will definately make this recipe again :) I think next time instead of rice I will try to make the Indian bread to go with it.

Great curry recipe, but it's a tiny bit tangier than I like.  Next time I would probably use less plain yogurt and a little more coconut milk.

I've made this recipe several times.  I really like the fullness of the curry that comes from the coconut milk.  Also, I add a little extra curry powder and cayenne pepper.  Next time, I'm going to add a little fenugreek seed to see if we can smooth it out.

Like others have mentioned, a very good starter recipe, especially for newcomers to Indian cooking.  The sauce gets more flavorful and rich the longer it simmers - i let mine go upwards of 45 minutes, and it was divine.  I made quite a few changes to the recipe, which is why I'm only giving 4 stars.  (add more curry powder, garam masala, veggies, lay off the lemon juice a bit, etc.)

I used this to make curry for the first time and I loved it. Its super easy and fast and turns out great even though I eliminated a lot of the ingredients since we have very difficult eaters in my household and we did not want it hot. Thanks!

My husband LOVES this recipe.   I followed the changes made by LWELKNER and increased curry to 8T and I used Indian Chili powder (not cayenne).   I bought the special indian chili powder from Wegmans (in bulk) - was very good.    I think it is very hot, but my husband says it is HOT!   So for anyone who loves heat - you will love this recipe.   Also used tomato sauce and cooked down to make paste.   Give this a try....   Next time I will add some veggies and potatoes.

Turned out AMAZING!!! I made this for my boyfriend who LOVES indian food. And it turned out very similar to the mussamen curry we usually order out. I tweaked it just a tad. By adding potatoes and carrots to it. And also added a bit more curry. Love that curry flavor!!!Try it you wont regret it!!!!

Phenomenal Curry Recipe! Tweak it as you wish. I recommend adding a can of whole new potatoes to the dish a few minutes before taking it off of the stove. Also (may seem weird) but I add a couple of sliced hard cooked eggs over top of the dish served atop a bed of Basmati or Jasmine rice. You will dig it!

I think this needs some work. The recipe is very easy and well written, but lacked some of the flavor I expect from curries. 

First, we always season our meat, so we let the chicken marinate in garam masala for a few hours. We also used more curry powder, at least double (though we tend to eyeball it) and a dash more salt. 

I think the lemon juice made it too bitter so I'd skip that next time. Not sure what else this is missing, but it seemed a little flat to me. Perhaps I'll try using fresh or canned tomatoes next time instead of the tomato paste.

My family loved this recipe, but I did make some changes. I used skinless chicken thighs in place of breasts. I also left the meat on the bones. Also used buttermilk in place of the coconut milk, only because I did not have coconut milk. Did not use cayenne pepper. I served this delicious curried chicken over rice, and received compliments from my fussy family.
Thanks for posting this recipe.

This is just like the chicken curry my mom would make.  My mom would always serve this with a bunch of "toppings"  we added on top of our curry and rice as if it were a sundae.  It's fun for the kids to customize their meal.  In separate bowls :  cooked crumbled bacon, crushed pineapple,  shredded coconut, chopped hard boiled egg whites, chopped hard boiled egg yolks, crushed peanuts.  This is also a good way to get kids used to the taste of curry if they are not used to it!

Yummy!  I didn't have fresh ginger or garlic; so used powder.  Also, I didn't have a bay leaf.  But, It was still very, very good.  I have eaten in many different Indian restaurants in my, ahem, advanced years, and this rates right up there, in my opinion.  Thank you Amanda, for sharing this recipe!

I made this recipe almost to the T. I followed a couple of the suggestions to add extra curry powder which I increased to about 5 tablespons. Even with that, we found it to be bland with only the flavors of curry and cayenne pepper coming through. It tasted like was missing something. Not sure what it was. Probably will not be making this version again.

This lacked dimensions of flavor.  I doubled the curry and toasted it per other reviewers suggestions, but the dish had so much curry without other spices to counterbalance it that it just tasted like, well...curry.  It's the first time curry has actually tasted bland to me.  And I'm pretty sure bland curry is an oxymoron!  If I make it again, I will make as written instead of following the top couple reviews.  Perhaps that way the flavors of cinnamon, coconut milk, etc will be more outstanding.

I really, really liked this! Fairly easy to make for an ethnic dish and let's me enjoy some Indian cooking at home. Make sure to serve with Jasmine or Basmati rice since plain white rice won't be the same. Great the next day as leftovers too!

This is a really good curry dish.  I followed the recipe making only a couple of very slight modifications: (1) I toasted the curry powder and paprika in a dry bowl before putting it in the oil; (2) I chopped up a red bell pepper and a threw in a 1/2 cup of frozen peas just to increase the amount of veggies in the dish.  It tasted great and my boyfriend really liked it too.  I served over basmati rice.  Yum.

I have made this several times now and I double the curry powder and leave out the cayenne pepper and lemon at the end.........tastes great every time. I have also made this with stewing BEEF instead of chicken and it is AMAZING!

I asked my husband what he wanted for a special dinner tonight and he said 'chicken curry'. I was stumped- never made it before! So I googled 'easy chicken curry' and stumbled upon this recipe. We don't like it super hot, so I left out the cayenne pepper, and added black pepper and a sprinkling of crushed red pepper. I also used lowfat yogurt. UNBELIEVABLE! I've never made an ethnic dish before that tastes so close to restaurant quality! He already printed it out and stuck it in my recipe box- so apparently it was a hit! So good! Thanks a million! :)

I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was a very good but it was spicy. I had to put in some extra yogurt to make it more mild. Make sure to shake the can of coconut milk before using in the recipe.

I made this dish today for my husband and I. I cut the recipe in half, as I thought 4 servings would be too much for 2 people, it turns out that even 4 servings probably wouldn't have been enough.  Even with rice and naan bread, it was barely enough food for 2 people.  We also both found that the recipe seemed gritty. It wasn't the worst curry I've ever had, but it definitely wasn't the best..  I made the recipe to the letter, and it seemed off. Perhaps with more coconut milk the spices may have melted more, and the extra milk would have made it so the sauce didn't turn out like a paste.  It wasn't bad.. but it wasn't curry.

so good... I ommitted the cayenne pepper and lemon juice at the end because it was already perfect. I also pre-fried the spices before adding the oil and other ingredients, as suggested by another reviewer.

YowZerrr!!!!! Sooo Good. I am a huge indian food lover. And I have had my fair share of curry's. Especially in New York City and Philly, where I reside.  I made this because it sounded pretty good. And I didnt feel like getting indian take out from some buffet style college campus indian food restaurant.Let me tell you it was really solid and very tasty. Use half a lemon though. And I used 5 tablespoons of curry powder instead of three. Also I added cooked peas and cooked, diced red potato's (large) to the skillet when close to done. That kicked it to a whole different level!! Try it you cant go wrong!!!!!

Not bad, but definitely not a 5 star.  Would leave out lemon juice as another reviewer suggested as well as cook the spices beforehand.  I also should have used full fat coconut milk.  With those changes the flavors should be stronger and the sauce creamier.

This recipe made almost too much sauce.  I added a little extra curry powder and some peas.  My husband, who can been picky when it comes to anything other than meat and potatoes, LOVED it.

This recipe is amazing! I've been searching for a curry recipe forever, looking for a good indian dish to make at home instead of neeeding to eat out.  Only change made was marinading the chicken in lemon juice for an hour before cooking, also used no paprika and no sugar, increased curry to 4 TBL.sp. Really yummy. served w/basmati rice and naan.

This curry dish was the best one I have tried yet, and let me tell you I have been searching high and low for the perfect curry recipe! I have a feeling the yogurt and tomato paste are the ingredients I have been missing. These are the small changes I made - I used a combination of curry powder and red curry paste. No cinnamon, sugar, bay leaf or lemon juice. I also left the cayenne powder out and let each person add chili paste to their own plate, and I’m glad I did because it was plenty spicy for me but my husband added more heat. Served with crushed peanuts, Jasmine rice (or boiled potatoes) and the roasted cauliflower from this site - this is now our favorite meal! **Update** in an effort to perfect this recipe to our liking, I now also add about 2T of smooth peanut butter.

This recipe turned out really rich and pretty in color and looked a lot more appetizing than it actually was.    It seemed a little bland, which surprised me.  If I were to ever make it again, I would definitely add more spices and something to give it a little kick.  The curry seemed to overpower all the other flavors in this dish -it almost tasted powdery.   I might also try sour cream in place of the yogurt as another reviewer suggested.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this curry - however, I did make several changes.  First of all, I made my own curry powder (coriander, cumin, turmeric, ginger, mustard, black pepper, red pepper, chili, and bay leaf - "mild curry powder" recipe from this site), then I omitted the cinnamon and ginger(cinnamon - because that makes it taste like garam masala, and ginger - because I had some in my curry powder).  Furthermore, I substituted ground turkey for the chicken breast and added some cooked chickpeas to add more body.  Finally, I didn't have yogurt, so I just added the entire can of coconut milk (however, next time I may try it with only the yogurt to see how it would be without that slightly sweet taste of coconut).  This was mild and delicious and I would make it again.

I've made this twice now - the first time was terrible. I listened to one reviewer who said to add 8 tbsp of curry and that was a huge mistake. It was SO bitter. Tonight, I tried it again and used 2 tbsp of curry powder and 2 tbsp of marsala seasoning (a mix of curry, cinnamon, and other spices). I did roast it in the pan before adding the onions as suggested by others. I wasn't sure about the sugar, but didn't regret using it. Towards the end I added a couple of tsp of flour to help thicken the sauce up a little. I served over rice with cucumber-mint yogurt. VERY yummy - my husband couldn't believe it was the same dish.

this was my first attempt at making curry and it turned out great! i followed the suggestions made by others.  i added more curry powder about 5 tbsp and more tomato paste, about 2 tbsp. i also toasted the curry powder before adding it. i used 1 cup of coconut milk instead of 3/4 cup. i only used about 1.5 tsp of lemon juice and a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper and it tasted fine. i also used chicken thighs. it was a little grainy, but that was probably because i added a tbsp of curry towards the end. i might try curry paste next time. overall, it was a great recipe after all the alterations.  easy to make and satisfied my craving for curry!

Very good recipe. My husband said he didn't liked curry, but when he tasted this he loved it. He now asks for it once a week. It made the whole kitchen smell great. Have made many times.

This is a great recipe. However, the next time I make it, I'm going to add some potatoes, peas, and other goodies. There is a lot of sauce that is just begging for more stuff. Overall, this is awesome.

This is good!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and although I was worried how I would like the warm/cooked yogurt, it tasted yummy!  Just want to add a few things..
1)This only makes 2-3 portions
2)While it was spicy there was little heat...next time I would add some Garam Masala for the extra heat

Over all, this is a basic chicken curry recipe, it is not exotic or fancy, but it sastifies and if you add rice and naan it is *almost* like an authentic Indian meal!

I just tried this recipe and it is pretty good!  It definitely has an Indian taste to it.  I added cubed potatoes to the recipe and it made it even better! I didnt add as much yogurt (about 3/4 cup), and I added more cayenne pepper and ginger root...Also, although I love chicken breast, I added thighs instead so the chicken can absord more of the flavor...a very good substitute! yummy I must say! A definite recommendation to all.

This is a very good curry recipe, but it didn't quite match up to my Bengali friend's expert curry-making skills.  Nonetheless, it's a fine dish that totally satisfied our craving for curry, and it's easy to make.  I'll make this dish again many more times in the future.

This is exactly what I have been looking for! I am 5 months pregnant and have been craving curry chicken! The only thing I did different was use 3 chicken breasts instead of 2. I served it over yellow rice. Word of caution: your home will smell like curry for a few days!

Very good.  And so easy to make!  Has a wonderful curry kick to it (-I
like spices and this was perfect-) and a great traditional Indian sauce
texture.  I used low-fat coconut milk and fat-free yogurt, to apparently
no ill effect.  I served it on basmati rice, which worked out nicely.
Note that the dish is really more like two or three servings, not four.

Good recipe, excellent with a couple of changes.  I added a little brown sugar, apples and raisins and it came out quite tasty.  The chicken is moist and the flavor is robust.

De-lish!! My first attempt at cooking Indian food..was completely inspired after watching the movie the Lunchbox. My dish was a hit, everyone loved it, including me. Personally, I would leave out the lemon juice at the end. I added garam masala (found at the grocery store) and used less curry then recipe called for..salt was a definite challenge..taste as you go and salt to taste. I will definitely make this dish again and again!!

I've made it twice now and it always comes out amazing. The sauce is thick and full of flavor. My only issue is the yogurt doesn't blend completely into the sauce. I think maybe mixing the yogurt and coconut milk together before adding to the pan would work. It doesn't effect the texture at all just the presentation so I'm still giving it 5 stars.

outstanding!! I made a large patch and bottled it. It kept for months in the fridge and was so easy to whip up a good meal by just adding chicken to the sauce and simmering for a half hour.

I have made this recipe many, many times and every time that I make it, it turns out wonderfully!  I make some additions which do not effect the quality, but I think they are now necessary ingredients.  I use 6-8 boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I put them in there whole.  I also cut up 1 large sweet potato into squares and put that in there, along with 1 cup of sweet frozen peas, when the recipe says to add the chicken.  Always turns out great!  Oh, and I don't use the cayenne but that is just a personal preference.  I serve this with an Indian mango chutney.

I did not care for this recipe. Sorry to give a bad review but we are curry fans and love ethnic food. It was not a matter of our spices being off as I use them on a daily basis. It was just not a good recipe for us.

Its a good base but I did change most of the quantities. 2 onions, lots more garlic (1/4 cup of minced garlic), 2-3 tbsp ginger, 1/4 cup curry powder, skip the sugar, though I sometimes use vanilla yogurt and that adds sweetness,(must be greek yogurt or it will be too liquidy), the whole can of coconut milk, 4 oz can of tomato paste, 4 chicken breasts, 1tsp cayenne, and everything else I leave the same as the recipe calls for.  This is more med than it is hot, but that is our preference. Have made this many times, love it.

This was delicious.  The only down side is the curry smell that lingers the following day, but it's worth it.  I did make the following changes after reading other reviews:
1) Used vegetable oil instead of olive oil for more a authentic flavor.
2) Cooked the dry ingredients in the oil first then added the onions, garlic and ginger together.
3) Used a whole small chicken that I boned and cut into bite-size peices as that's what I had.
4) Omitted the tomato paste and lemon juice.
I served it over brown basmati rice.  Can't say enough of how good this is.  Thanks for sharing this Amanda.

My first taste of Indian food, my son wanted to make it, and did. We used hot curry powder and didn't use the bay leaf. It was soooo good! The flavors of cinnamon, curry, and ginger were divine. We served it over Calrose rice. It was very easy to make and we really enjoyed it.

This smells wonderful and taste just as good.  The first time I made it, though, used greek yogurt, cuz that's what I had.  BIG MISTAKE...it mutes all the other spices and makes a wonderful dish just ho-hum.  Make it as written, maybe add more curry, and use regular plain yogurt, and you've got a winner.

We tried this recipe last night. I did not have any fresh Ginger and we but 2 small containers of yogurt along with the whole can of coconut milk. We also used lemon juice that was in a bottle 

It came out fine. I enjoyed it with minute rice and Indian bread.. So good. Can not wait to have it again with the fresher ingredients. 

We had wished we made it a little more spicy but I am happy with this recipe non the less.. Thanks for sharing..

Followed instructions exactly, curry turned out too spicy (even according to husband who likes a medium to hot spicy in indian restaurants) and not very flavorful at the same time. I was disappointed.

I've been searching forever for a curry recipe to recreate some my brother made a while back, and came across this one at the last minute. I don't think I could've found a better one! This really is quite delicious, although if you're a wuss when it comes to spicy food this may have your mouth burning a bit, but then if it didn't it wouldn't be curry.

I added potatoes (cut up and boiled beforehand and  added to the curry with the chicken) and peas. Delicious. Another recipe I tried said to cook the chicken beforehand--definitely better not to.

My family LOVES this recipe.  With food allergies in our household, I made the following alterations:  I use a leek instead of the onion.  Instead of plain yogurt, I substituted coconut yogurt.  Very tasty.

Wasn't as creamy as what we are use to. Seemed almost watery.

I didn't try it myself because I don't eat chicken - the review by my family was that the flavor was great but the chicken was hard and chewy. Any suggestions?  It was fresh chicken breast (not previously frozen).

have not eaten curry before, only had curry spiced salads, but  the recipe was easy and I incorporated many of the review suggestions. I automatically doubled the recipe, so i'd have leftovers. and i toasted the spices in the beginning in a hot pan, then added the oil and browned the chicken and onion together. the lemon did really, really change the taste, but i did not dislike it. I omittied the sugar and added a little honey, and left out the cayenne as my norwegian daughter would complain about it...all in all, it was quite good, i think, and I will make it again!thanks!

I tried this recipe and the Coconut Curry Chicken recipe also on this website and I prefer this one much better. I followed the suggestions of others and toasted the spices first before adding the oil and other ingredients. I did not use the sugar, lemon  and it was delicious without. I substituted 2 dollops of sour cream for the plain yogurd and added cilantro and peas towards the end. My family agreed this recipe had a more "curry" taste then the other one. I will definitely make again.

Indians hardly ever use olive oil for cooking curries as it has a very low smoking point.Red chilli powder instead of cayenne is also a good suggestion.

I've made this recipe more times than I can count. It's a fabulous go to recipe for a quick and easy curry. The only change that I've made is that instead of using coconut milk and yogurt, I double the yogurt and take out the coconut milk. It changed the whole flavor of the curry and makes it taste even better. I don't add any lemon juice this way as the yogurt adds enough tang. Makes it healthier too.

This korma was not greasy or too sweet, like many restaurant kormas. I thought this was delicious with very complex flavors. I really loved the little hint of lemony citrus in it. Saving to my recipe box. Yum!

SO very good! Served over coconut jasmine rice and garnished with a little toasted coconut.
Used 2 cans coconut milk (but reserve 1 cp for the rice), only 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 full tsp fresh grated ginger, and no cayenne (for heat add thai chili powder, much better for this dish), 1 & 1/2 tsp salt for 2 lbs chicken and simmer covered

Very good chicken curry.  Tastes like most of the curry you will get in a U.S. Indian restaurant.  Definitely add more spice and more curry.  I used at least 4 T curry powder and about 1 T of sriracha instead of cayenne.  I made it once with no yogurt/coco milk, out of necessity.  Used cream cheese and milk instead and it was still amazing.

Absolutely delicious! My husband, 4.5 year old and 3 year old all ate it (with Basmati rice & Naan bread). I omitted the cayenne pepper and instead added Indian masala spice, and 2 tbsp tomato paste instead of one. It was amazing, we loved it!

I have made this several times and every time it is great. I recently discovered coconut oil that has so many uses and I used that instead of olive oil. Delicious smell. I think next time I will add seasoned salt because I find myself continually adding salt and it never gets there... Also most authentic curry recipes use dark meat. To save money I bough chicken legs and threw maybe 5 in and simmered for an hour until fork tender and removed them, skinned them and removed the meat and added it back. Yummy and tender. I used the about twice everything so I could eat it all week. I love this recipe!

Maybe I just don't like curry that much, but something was definitely missing from this recipe. Something needed to balance out the curry and yogurt flavors, I thought they were too strong. Some sauteed mushrooms might add a butteriness that would enhance it...? I also thought it was too soupy, next time I'd cut out some of the yogurt to reduce the soupiness. It was pretty good with some pita bread to sop up the remaining sauce! That part was real tasty.

Pretty good.  I left out the ginger root and somehow forgot the lemon juice.  It was a bit too creamy so we added about a cup of water.  I wonder if the lemon juice would have helped.  Overall pretty good.  I also used garam marsala instead of cayenne pepper and used potatoes, tofu and peas instead of chicken.

Had high hopes for this dish after reading some of the reviews, but ended up not liking this at all, wanted fresh homemade flavours, but in the end I thought this ended up tasting no different than shop bought Curry Jars of Chicken Curry!

I love curry and this recipe really hit the spot. I also made a few changes. I didn't have tomato paste so used a small can of tomato sauce. Didn't use a bay leaf either cos was all out. I added baby potatoes (parboiled them first) and cut up green/red/orange peppers. Next time I will add cauliflower and broccoli. I omitted the last step as when I tasted the simmered curry it was great and did't need a thing - so no lemon or cayenne (it was hot enough for me). I added it to a bed of rice and really loved it.  This is a keeper. Now what do I do with the half can of coconut milk? LOL

Great recipe!  The only change I made was adding 1 1/2 cups of bias sliced baby carrots to the onions during the sautee.  Loved it- will be having again often.  Great for cold Kansas evenings.

I loved it, it was delicious! I did change it just slightly by adding potatoes and carrots (cooking them for a few minutes in a skillet wit water and a little oil before hand) and also skipping on the ginger and bay leaf and substituting the coconut milk for regular 2% milk.  (just because I didnt buy them)   I did have to add a little extra milk and curry powder but overall it was sooo good. Great recipe! I used Indian Curry from the Spice Market at Pike's Place in Seattle. =] Highly recommend it!

Made this this afternoon and not only was it easy, but it made a delicious meal.  I served it with currants, cranberry/apple chutney, and zucchini cornbread, all recipes from allrecipescom.  This is definitely a dish I will make again.

Simple and delicious.  Exchanged cayenne for chili powder and added about 5 T curry; I also like to add peas, potatoes and other such vegetables.

To get the amount of fat content down, I played around a little.  Instead of using the coconut milk, I used 2 small containers of fat free coconut yogurt and then some fat free half and half.  I did not have tomato paste so I just used a small can of diced tomatoes(without the juice) and it worked fine.  Instead of sugar, I used a pack of splenda.  The fresh lemon juice at the end was the perfect touch.  The end result was very good!

This was not that enjoyable.  It was way too sweet (I'd cut the cinnamon in half).  I guess my husband and I prefer green or red curry!

The first time I made this recipe I used every ingredient called for.  I was not happy with the results because the cinnamon was too overpowering.  Made the sauce without the cinnamon and I was so happy with the results.  I am not opposed to the flavor of cinnamon in baked goods but not in a savory dish.

Not bad at all. For me it just wasn't as flavorful as I'd have liked it. Perhaps next time I'll use more curry, as another reviewer suggested. It's not that it needs to be spicier in the sense of heat, but spicier in the sense that it just needs a bit more flavor! Overall though it's a great recipe with easily accessible ingredients and I'll definitely make it again, with more curry and cayenne pepper, most likely.

Like other reviewers, I felt that something was missing, but I do not cook Indian food enough to know what it was.  I had to increase a LOT of the spices and add others as it was very bland.  After putting at least 2x the amount of spice it turned out ok, aside from it still missing something.  The leftovers are much better as the spice has longer to settle in.

Great recipe! Two words that anyone making this should know, though: Garam Masala. I was really glad I had some of this spice mixture on hand...I added it a couple of times throughout the cooking process.

This was some mediocre curry I think.  I would definitely leave the lemon juice out.  Some of the average quality of this could be attributed to the bad curry powder I bought, but it's definitely not very authentic.  It turns out sour and salty.

Still not sure what possessed me to try this--I guess it sounded like something I'd like and all the flavors were appealing. Have to say it turned out great, even better than I could have imagined. I made it exactly as described in the recipe and it was delicious. Could easily add some sliced up bell peppers next time or even some potatoes. That said, my wife was a bit put off by the cinnamon (she associates it with desserts) and wasn't as appreciative of it as I was. Don't know if I'll get a chance to make this again, but it was truly excellent (and surprisingly easy to make).

I made this verbatim from the recipe over Jasmine Rice, with the exception of the fresh ginger - I used the jarred, sushi ginger. It came out very good and it would have gotten 5 stars, but I think the lemon juice and Cayenne pepper in the end are unecessary. The cayenne added unecessary heat and the lemon tinge does not seem to work very well with the curry/cinamon/paprika mixture. 4 Stars, will make it again sans Lemon and Cayenne.

This was the first time I had ever made a curry.  I was a bit nervous as it was for a party of 15 friends.  I live in the Middle East and my friends know their curries and I am delighted to say that everyone love it!

We loved this recipe!!! It was a hit with my husband, so much that he wante me to make it twice in one week. I would definitly omit the chili powder and just do the Cayenne pepper. I served this over Jasmine rice and all I can say is mmmmm....Going to be one of our family recipies thanks!

Fairly easy to do, tasted alright, but not an OMG gotta do this again kind of thing.  I doubled the sauce 'cause we like things saucey.  I tasted it when it was almost done and realized that it was pretty boring as is.  So I added one 28 oz can of drained, diced tomatoes and one 14 oz can of drained peas.  Instead of cayenne, I added pepper flakes while it was simmering.  Thanks, but we will continue to look for another indian curry recipe.

This was really good. I followed another posters advice and heated up the curry powder first, then gradually added the other spices, heating them up. I don't know if this made a significant difference because I hadn't made this the original way, but it was very good. I used Hot Curry Powder by Penzey's, which I think makes a difference. I also added a couple more tablespoons of curry powder for additional spice. It was excellent, and simple. I think next time I'll add peas and maybe another vegetable, and extra chicken. Cilantro would probably be an excellent addition, as well.

I have made this recipe twice. I thought it was pretty good. My husband liked that it was very spicy. It is not the best I've had and I love curry, but I like it and would make it again. I may try some of the suggestions like more curry powder next time around.

YES! YES YES YES! I made this a few days ago so I don't remember my exact modifications.. I do know that I added much more curry powder than called for (love the taste). Next time will add pineapple tidbits. DELICIOUS!!

This stuff would make Ghandi end a hunger strike! It was so good that I made it twice in about 3 days. I served it over brown rice that I had cooked in a rice cooker and some warm pita bread which was an adequate substitute for the nan you might have with a traditional Indian meal

Wow! I was really looking forward to this curry based on all of the 5-star ratings. Generally I don't vary a recipe until we've first tried it so we followed it exactly. Served it to a party of five and the response was underwhelming to say the least. Perhaps we've been spoiled by eating out at some decent local Indian restaurants but it is a complete mystery to me why this dish gets the scores it's been given. Sorry, we could never recommmend this.

Made this exactly as written and it came out delicious! It's very spicy, so next time I will reduce the cayenne. Served with short grain rice and Naan from this site.

This is SO SCRUMPTIOUS! I have served it numerous times to friends and family and they always rave about it.  The only changes I made: I use an entire can of coconut milk.  I add an extra teaspoon of curry powder and 1/2 teaspoon more of cinnamon.  Wonderful!  Thanks so much for sharing!

The first and only time I'v eever had this dish was in London, England over a year ago.  I never thought I could make it, but this recipe was easy to follow and the results were great. I followed recipe as is, but the next time I would season the chicken before adding it to the pan.  I enjoyed this with the Naan bread recipe also on this site and Stonewall Kitchen's Farmhouse chutney - YUM!

This was very easy and really tasty! I doubled everything and used a cinnamon stick rather than ground. I also added all the spices after the onions cooked down and let them cook for several minutes to bring out the flavors before adding the other ingredients.  YUMMY!!

This turned out well and I would make it again.  I would like to mention that it didn't make four servings.  We got about 3 servings (and we aren't big eaters.)  With that in mind, I would suggest doubling the recipe because the coconut milk and the tomato paste both came in a can that would have made double the sauce in the same amount of time.  Otherwise, the dish is very easy to prepare and tasty too!

This recipe turned out almost exactly liked I hoped it would!  I did make a few changes, though.  I did just a pinch of cinnamon and sugar and I skipped the lemon juice at the end.  I also added potatoes when I added the chicken but I think that made a lot of the liquid get absorbed so I might adjust the liquid ingredients next time so it's not so thick.  I also added an extra Tbsp. of curry powder, a fair amount of salt and a little thai chili garlic sauce for some extra heat.  I threw in some mushrooms and carrots towards the end and they were a nice addition.  My husband definitely wants to add this to our meal rotation!

This is by far my favorite chicken curry recipes I have ever made.  It was really easy, very quick to prepare.  I made this particular recipe for my roommate who had never eaten Indian food before, and she loved it! I served it with Saffron Rice and iced black tea with honey.  It was fantastic!

I LOVE this recipe. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. We don't have any indian restaurants close by, so when we need our curry fix, this is what we make. The only change I make is to increase the amount of heat and double the sauce. As the recipe is written, it just isn't quite enough sauce for us. But again - DELICIOUS!

I was a bit alarmed when after adding all those ingredients to the onions, I made quite a paste, but in the end, it was very good.  Next time I'll add more coconut milk and add a veggie.  Chopped spinach, potatoes or chick peas would make it better for me.

With the great reviews I just had to try this curry. I was disappointed with the end result, and agree with the comments of WAMommyof4 and Gondwana, this is only a good curry base and it took a lot of extra ingredients to make it what I would consider 5 stars.

I've made this recipe about three times now, and absolutely love it!  Very few changes, although I did skip the sour cream and used a whole can of coconut milk, as another review suggested.  One of my friends is a chef who showed me how to make a Thai dish similar to this one, and keeping with his technique I added the ginger in with the onion.  I don't have cayenne pepper where I'm at, so I also added a finely diced hot pepper with the onion/ginger, and used hot paprika.  This did the trick for the heat, and we have the formula down to our taste now.  I thought that a little something was missing the first time I made it, and added a splash of pineapple juice the second time, which added some nice flavor.  I currently have no measuring utensils so the proportions are all guesstimation, but I have to say that this recipe has turned out to be a winner regardless every time!

This recipe has everything I want: it's simple, easy to adjust, and absolutely delicious.  Both my husband and I thought it could have easily come from our favorite restaurant.  I followed another reviewer's suggestions and toasted the spices before adding the olive oil and onion, and that really added to the flavor.  I think next time I'll add veggies (potatoes and peas), or maybe just do vegetarian.***Update.  This is officially my favorite curry recipe because I can substitute anything in.  Spinach and garbanzo beans are great.

there was a lot going on in the curry. this was the first indian dish i attempted at home; i thought the dish was pretty easy to make and tasted pretty good. i will make it again and cook it on a different burner for less heat and probably skip the pepper at the end.

This is very, very, good. Very tasty. Even better the next day! All the flavors blend in together. Very authentic. Now I do want to say one thing... Don't make this if you are in a hurry! I made this recipe twice. The first time I was in a hurry, I ended up putting in the wrong measurements, I had no coconut milk, I could'nt find any place that sold it, so I used regular milk, it just did not taste good at all! Two days later, I made it again. I took my time, I threw it the spices before the onion and the garlic, like reviewer mentioned, used coconut milk this time, and it turned out awesome! This a recipe that needs a little TLC...take your time with and it will turn out to be a very good meal!

Delicious!  I used Nadia's suggestions and stirred around the dry ingredients before adding chicken (see her review).  Working with what I had in my kitchen, I used ketchup instead of tomato paste, chili powder instead of cayenne pepper, lime instead of lemon, and omitted the paprika, ginger, and sugar.  Still, it was quite tasty.  I also used Madras curry powder - I love this variety the best.  The hint of lime gives the dish a nice touch.  Would definitely make it again!

After spending time in India earlier this year, I wanted to try making some Indian dishes. This is the first curry I've ever made and I was surprised at how easy it was. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I improvised. I had no paprika and had to substitute ground ginger for freshly grated. I also had to substitute ketchup for tomato paste. I didn't have coconut milk, so I threw in a handful of coconut, some milk, and some extra yogurt. I followed one of the reviewer's suggestions and roasted the spices together before adding any of the other ingredients. At the end, to make up for missing spices, I threw in more cayenne pepper and ginger. I thought the curry was great and it smelled wonderful. I'm looking forward to making it again with all the ingredients. I'll try using Indian Chilis next time instead of just curry.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, only I substituted sour cream for the yogurt. When I tasted it, I was not too impressed so I added a little more sugar and that helped, but it is still a little bitter. I consider myself a decent cook, so I don't think it was any error on my part. I think it just depends on how you like your curry, which comes in many different ways. That being said, I think I will still use this recipe, with many modifications, because it is a good starting point. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great recipe for USA cooks. It will not pass muster with my Indian co-workers who bring food from home, but it is GOOD. I personally think b/s chicken breasts tend to be dry so I used thighs. I also followed another review and replaced the cinnamon and paprika with 1 teaspoon garam masala. Spicy dishes are my favorite but when I tasted it after the 25 minutes cooking time it was spicy enough and so delicious that I stopped right there and did not try the lemon juice or cayenne pepper. It was so velvety smooth and delicious  that I cannot wait to make it again. I would also recommend to double it for 4 people as this was just enough for 2. Enjoy!

Not the best curry I've had.  I was really excited about this- came out sort too mild. I agree with the comment- it smelled much better than it tasted.

The recipe was made as written with the exception of using lime instead of lemon.  It was way too hot and difficult to eat it.  If I tried this again I would omit the cayenne, but even then I'm not sure I would enjoy it.

This is EXCELLENT! I have only had curry while eating out. This was my first time making it and it was so easy and tasted great! I had to add a little more sugar and coconut milk to suit our taste and since we were giving it to our children (who love spicey) we had to omit the cayenne completely. It is QUITE spicy with out it! Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe!  A couple of tweaks and you have 5 stars!
If you really want the dish to come alive try swapping the lemon for lime, and trade the curry powder for curry paste, and substitute a real cinnamon stick for the ground up stuff (add it with the liquids and then take it out with the bay leave), you can really taste the difference with each swap and you won’t regret it. 
To really take the recipe it into flavour country add a roughly chopped capsicum (whichever colour you like the look/taste of) and a diced spicy bell pepper when the recipe has about 5-8 minutes left on the simmer, and some coriander and chives when she’s almost ready.  Enjoy either way though!

This is by far, my favorite Indian recipe.  The only change I make to this recipe is that I add a 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger.  Besides that, this recipe needs absolutely no changes, and is PERFECT the way it is!  Restaurant Quality!

Very good recipe - I added partially cooked some potato chunks and green beans and added them part way through. The flavors really hit their peak the day after as left overs. I would dial down the spice just a little bit the next time i make this.

This tasted just like my favorite Indian dish in downtown Milwaukee that I love!  As with most of the chicken dishes that I made...I cooked 4 chicken breasts in the slow cooker in chicken broth for about 8 hours.  When that is done then I mixed it in with the curry sauce.  I only used a pinch of cayenne as I have small children.  I will definetly be making this again!

Wow! is all I can say, angels dancing on my tongue was what I felt on the first spoonful!!
I thought I'd never better my own chicken curry recipe but this one is now my own chicken curry recipe!!
I used coconut cream instead of milk and added a little water as it seemed a bit dry , also used some  more curry and cayenne than specified but I like my curries pretty hot.

I have eaten tons of chicken curry in my day (I have a lot of south indian friends and they like to feed me) and this, I must say is a profoundly awesome recipe. Salt is key in curries. I always say to start with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and then keep tasting until you like it. Without the right amount of salt, the curry flavors seem bland. I added one diced potatoe for authenticity.

Long-time curry fan, first-time curry maker here, so I am thrilled that it came out as tasty as it did. I had to subsitute more yoghurt for the coconut milk as the shop here doesn't store it but it didn't seem to ruin the meal. I also cut down on the cinnamon (halved it) and I think I will use a little less ginger next time. I completely omitted the cayene pepper and it was still spicy enough for us, in fact, we added a little more yoghurt while eating to tone it down a bit. Served it with rice and naan bread. My boyfriend had not been a curry fan before but he gobbled this one up and is looking forward to the leftovers (of which we don't have enough unfortunately, 8 portions only really made for 4-5 for us). I think I will try adding some veggies such as peas and carrots to that batch for variety. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Very tasty! The key I think is a really good curry for those who found it bland. Mine was a little too thin as I do like a thicker sauce. I did use a light coconut milk so that might be the culprit. I added a cup of broccoli florets to get some veggies in there. I like that the broccoli sops up some of the sauce. I also used skinless, boneless chicken thighs as I find white meat too dry in a curry. Will make again for sure!!

Excellent recipe, but too cinnamony. We added 8 small new potatoes, 14oz light coconut milk (the whole can), 18oz yogurt (all of the 3 small containers), and cooked it an additional 20 minutes for the potatoes. The result was good, but too much cinnamon. Next time we'll cut the cinnamon down.

I have had curry many times and wanted to find a recipe that I could make at home. When I came across this recipe I was really excited to try it. It turned out amazing and it was really easy. My suggestions on the recipe are to be PATIENT and let the flavors come together. Don't be afraid to add more spices if you find it to be too bland. I know in some reviews people were saying that it smelled great but didn't have good flavor; just add more spices. Also, when I made it, I didn't add the bay leaf because I didn't have it. Nor did I use the coconut milk or the lemon. I just used a little extra water since I added potato. I served the curry with rice and naan. Excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

A great base recipe. I added two small diced, cubed potatoes and green peas. I also increased the coconut milk to a full can of the lite variety, added garam masala, and used lemon juice as well as a bit of lime for more flavor. Make this recipe your own!!

Great!  I added 3 new potatoes, but I think I'll leave out the tomato paste next time.  Maybe could use a little more coconut milk...a work in progress for me!

I really love this recipe!! I modify it a little by using 1/2 the cayenne pepper and no salt and a full can of lite coconut milk. Also I found a curry powder that was somewhat on the sweet and pungent side and found that it made a big difference. 

I make the curry sauce and freeze it.  It is an easy dinner party meal.  Cook up brown rice ahead of time and keep warm or steam it just before serving to heat it, sautee chicken cubes till done ahead of time and leave in a covered dish... when it is time to eat, I heat up the curry sauce with the cooked chicken cubes in it to heat them, then add sugar snap peas for  1-2 minutes just to heat them (do not overcook - their crunch is especially nice in this dish) Pour over rice and garnish with yellow raisins and green onions...  I get rave reviews every time I serve it and while I am not a "comfortable" cook, the easy assembly at the last minute really makes me look good :)

Enjoy!

This is the first time I have ever made an Indian dish and this one was so incredibly easy! It is now my favorite dish that I plan to fix when I want to impress! I followed the recipe exactly and served over basmati rice. Yum!! Thank you so much for sharing!

Sorry, but I felt like I wasted my time making this. It was horribly bland with almost no flavor. It LOOKED wonderful, exactly how chicken curry should look, but, as written, this is bland as can be. It had a little bit of a hot kick, but no flavor otherwise. If you are looking for a really deep, rich indian taste, you will not get it from this recipe.

This recipe works out and tastes delicious every time. But, we always reduce the amount of liquid ingredients slightly because we enjoy a thicker sauce. Beautiful cooking aromas!

A very delicious curry recipe!  I did  not have yogurt, so I used sour cream and it turned out wonderfully!  I'll try it with yogurt next time to see if it makes a difference.

The flavor in the curry sauce is sooooo good. I really enjoyed making this dish and tasting it as the flavors developed. Given the amount of sauce, I think throwing in favorite vegetables would take this dish over the top! My husband, who claims to not care for curry, devoured it! Highly recommend!

This is the best chicken korma- like recipe I have found.  It did have a grainy texture that got better by adding the whole can of coconut milk(14 oz), and we like it hotter, so I added some garam masala, and extra cayenne.  Was much much better the next day! Thanks

This was very spicey and delicious, we loved it.  We love veggies so I  microwaved till almost done half a bag of frozen veggies - broccoli, carrots and cauliflower and added  it to the last 5 minutes cooking time of the curry mixture.

This recipe is easy and uses easy-to-find ingredients. It was a delight to the senses, with the tang of ginger and lemon, and the heat of the cayenne and other spices. We liked it, and I will make it again. I thought it was maybe too tangy; that might have been because I used lowfat sour cream instead of yogurt because that's what I had on hand. Next time I'll try it with yogurt and maybe use a little less lemon juice. Also, I thought mine tasted better when I mixed in chunks of fresh garden tomato. My husband, who loves Indian food, was happy with the curry. We had it over basmati rice.

This is our favorite curry recipe to date.
We prefer to add potatoes and use 3/4 can of tomato sauce (instead of tblspn paste)and a bit more coconut milk to keep it moist.  We serve it w/homemade naan and basmati rice and love it!

This is my all time favorite go-to recipe when introducing someone to indian food. You can increase/decrease the heat by the kind of curry powder you use. Remember, 3 TABLESPOONS is alot if you are using hot curry. It's alot of ingredients, but the point of indian cooking is to balance so many different flavors into something that just... works. It's about balance and flavor. And this recipe has it!

We liked it. We doubled the recipe. We substituted lime for lemon but didn't double that amount.  We also used "lite" coconut milk and fat free yogurt - which I'm sure reduced the fat content considerably.  I must have not put in enough salt, as we both thought it needed salt.  Easy to make and didn't have to buy a lot of expensive ingredients.  We'll definitely try this again.

Well, I really wanted this to be great. Instead, I got not so great. Don't get me wrong--it wasn't horrible, just not exactly what my tastebuds were hoping for. I'm even a super fan of curry. I used just a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and it was still too much for me. I'll consider trying it one more time--maybe it was something in the air tonight.

I suspect too much yogurt- way too sour. I didn't even put the lemon in! There is definitely a lot missing in the spice department- the bland and underwhelming flavor of the spices was overpowered by the sour and tangy cup of yogurt. Upon simmering, the yogurt curdled up and separated from the oil and burned to the bottom of the pan (I suggest frequent stirring which is a pain for 20-25 min). I think you'd have better luck replacing the yogurt with something else or adding much less yogurt but at the END instead of during simmering (it curdles up and tends to burn on the bottom of the pan). I tried to save this by adding some Garam Masala, cumin, chicken boulion, but to no avail. Just could not mellow out that overpowering tangy yogurt taste. In summary, don't make this recipe unless the idea of sprinkling curry powder on plain yogurt sounds delicious to you.

Wow, was this delicious! I decided to omit the tomato paste & lemon juice. I added the entire can of coconut milk. I used at least 2 teaspoons more curry powder & added 1 teaspoon of Garam masala. I also added two pre-cooked Yukon gold potatoes and 1 cup diced zucchini & 3/4 c. green peas. Both my hubby and I ate too much of it, it was so good! I served it with rice and fresh naan. Thank you for the recipe!

Very easy to make. You can adjust the heat a bit by cutting down or adding more curry. I find I also need to add a bit more of salt.

I will definitely make this Indian Chicken Curry again!  Flavor profile was awesome and the spices added wonderful layers and depth.  I had plain Greek yogurt on hand, and feel that it worked well - still gave the dish the slight sour and creaminess it needed.  I also used an entire 15 oz can of coconut milk (instead of the 6 oz indicated in the recipe).  Delicious.  Thank you.

Four stars because it's an excellent base recipe. This was my first stab at curry and my husband, a curry enthusiast, loooved it..he went on and on about it being a keeper!  Following the advice of earlier reviewers, I was very generous with the seasonings, garlic and onions...I seasoned chicken with turmeric, salt and coriander (would have added clove if I'd had it)...sautéed the seasonings BEFORE the garlic and onions in VEGETABLE OIL...went with chicken stock instead of coconut milk because that's what I had...added cayenne pepper..and let simmer for about 45 minutes...thanks for the recipe and thanks for the combined culinary expertise of the Allrecipes community :)!

Enjoyable, but the lemon overpowered all the other spices - half a lemon is definitely too much.  Tasted better before the lemon was added.

Good and delicious recipe. I left out the lemon juice and added diced potatoes about 5 minutes after you cook the chicken. Then I cover the pan and let it simmer for about an hour or until the potatoes are tender. This is really good the next day!

Made this for dinner after we decided we were getting bored by our usual food choices.  It was amazing!  I'm usually not very adventurous cook but this was easy to make and really yummy.  I even put some in the freezer for another day.

Very tasty!  I added some peas and carrots, served over brown rice. Did not have coconut milk but I had plain Greek yogurt so that worked well. Plus, I added more curry than the recipe called for and added some Tumeric. A very versatile and healthy dish.

I tried tens of curry recipes and never found the waou,,factor like that Indian restaurant taste...... But this is the one finally! We are lactose intolerant and I replaced the yogurt with two tablespoons of soya sour cream. Perfect! As well I followed another reader advise and replaced lemon juice with some kaffir lime for that fragant authentic flavor. Mmm! Serve with naan bread..

Ok but nothing to write home about. Lemon ended up taking acidity too far. Twenty to 25 minutes is too long for chicken to remain tender. Allrecipes once again frustrates with seemingly inflated ratings and slick video.  NOTE: Only change I made was to use coconut oil in place of olive oil.

We made this for our kids too so we cut the chili powder. Added 1/2 t. of salt and 2 boiled potatoes, skinned and cut into chunks, and a 16 oz bag of frozen peas and carrots.  Wow!  This is our favorite Indian dish.

I just love this recipe. Quick, easy and authentic. My son is not a very diverse eater but he likes curry and LOVES this recipe. He makes it often and to spice it up even more, he uses hot curry powder. We also use a little extra tomato paste and coconut milk to make it saucier.  Great over rice or with naan bread.

I loved this and so did my husband and two of my teenage sons.  I made two versions: one with chicken as the recipe says and one with Tempeh for myself. Both were great and I followed the recipe pretty exact. I added a little more lemon then listed in the recipe because I love lemon.  Anyway, will certainly make this again. I used fat free Greek yogurt and light coconut milk to decrease calories and fat and yet I still loved it. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this tonight and it was a hit... I did make a few changes though. I didn't have coconut milk so I used regular milk instead, I used marinara instead of tomato paste, tyme instead of bay leaves and I also added some chili powder.... It was soooo good, I'll definitely be making this again... Thanks for the recipe ??

This recipe was a good starting point. I changed a few things though (I rarely follow a recipe exactly). First I added all the spices in the oil (I used coconut oil because I was out of vegetable oil and olive is not the right kind for Indian food). I didn't add the cinnamon, but put in 2 sticks, I doubled the curry, plus added 2TB Garam Masala. After frying the spices, I added the tomato paste, onions, garlic, and ginger. I also didn't use just chicken breasts (most flavorless piece of the chicken), instead I used left over chicken meat from a whole chicken I had cooked the night before.

Just made this! The sauce is delicious, but not too spicy for my western tastes. Next time I will try some different spices in the curry, rather than using store bought stuff, but this is a great starting point!

Very yummy - I suggest adding 1 tbsp or so of white sugar to get the taste right. Otherwise it's a bit bitter.

I added half a small jar of curry sauce as well (I like lots of flavor and spice) and I thought it turned out really good!! I also added a bunch of different veggies after I added the chicken in and added a bit more coconut milk and used honey instead of sugar. Yummy!!

My cooking skills are, shall we say: average, if I’m being kind, but I do like to cook and I love Indian food as does my family.  I’ve always wanted to make a curry dish that didn’t involve just throwing a bunch of curry in a pot and praying to Annapurna that whatever came out approximated the general taste of Indian cuisine, and I have to say, this recipe did it. 
 
Quick, easy and tasty, to the point that when we all closed our eyes we imagined we were dining at one of our local Indian restaurants, then we opened our eyes, came back down to earth but still decided that it was pretty darn good.  I wouldn’t even begin to add or subtract ingredients, too far above my pay grade, however if you are looking for a terrific “something different”, then this is it, thanks for the recipe.

The flavor was too intense for me. I would describe it as too tangy. I think I may have preferred it with more coconut milk or yogurt.

I added a few more spices, added some broth as well to make a thicker sauce, but it was an excellent base to work off of. For those of us who like to be able to make a big pot of something and have leftovers. I served this with rice, and today I will be experimenting with it again using spaghetti squash instead of rice.

Excellent recipe. I made the usual adjustments for our personal tastes. 3 chicken breast halves, 1/2 the curry and 1/2 the cayenne. Doubled the garlic and onion. Better than mom's.

I am from Belize so curry is neither here or there. Here in Canada I have Guyanese, Jamaican, Trinidian and Indian friend who all make curry in different ways.  I made this and loved it,  I added more water and potatoes and baby carrots and covered pot and let it cook for an extra half hour or so.  It was delicious.

Really delicious and a fantastic use of leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Stayed mostly true to the recipe other than using turkey and bit of chicken broth to thin it. Mine got really thick... must have been the extra curry I used. Served over rice, with all the condiments we always use for a sweet and spicy curry - green onions, peanuts, mandarin oranges, toasted coconut flakes, raisins and diced tomato. Everybody dressed their own, according to taste. Superb and so easy!

My husband is an excellent cook and he RAVED about how good this was after I cooked it! I didn't have coconut milk, so I grabbed some sweetened coconut flakes and added about a half cup and then 3/4 cup water...I had to add a little more water as it cooked off as well. I also used ground chicken instead, simply because I was out. It had some good kick to it! So if you don't like spicy, add less cayenne pepper. But we loved it the way it is!

I think this turned out pretty good although I don't have anything to compare it to as I never ate a Indian Chicken Curry before.  I did take the advice of someonbe who rated 1 star and I used veg. oil.  I also cook a cinn. stick and cloves in the oil prior to the onions.  I also followed their tips on toasting the dry seasoning and tomato paste.  Tasty...thanks!

This was pretty bland before adding more spice. Once I tasted it I decided to add more curry, some garam masala and more cinnamon.  I fed this to my family and company. Total of 9 people and the only one that wouldnt eat it was my one year old. Other children ranged from 3-12.

This was my first ever curry recipe. My husband and his family had grown up in England and developed a rather fine taste for a good curry and this was a crowd pleaser for sure! I did not change anything and have come back to it time and again!

This turned out really well, I added the Indian chilli powder in place of the cayenne as one reviewer had suggested, it gave it the kick it needed.

We cook Indian often (though this was my first attempt at a curry), and I did the usual stuff you would do - roast the spices first, added a little cream, etc, and this is just an odd taste and consistency.  Not like any curry I've ever had, whether in restaurants or the homes of Indian friends.  I'm sorry - if you are a beginner to Indian this might be just the trick, but if you cook it often, you might look around a little more.  I probably should have done as other reviewers have suggested and replaced the Cayenne with proper Indian Chili powder; all I could taste was chalky coconut milk and Cayenne.

i had once had a coconut-based chicken curry a looong time ago. it was the first, and so nice i still remember the occasion, where, the cook etc..; so i tried this recipe as part of my christmas 2011 dinner dishes, with a slight modification: no sugar. oooiee!! i was blown away! And yet so easy to fix! it is now part of my permanent kitchen recipe repertoires.

This was fantastic. I did a little tweeking as well, (thanks to other's input). I added 3/4 tsp Garam Masala, cooked with coconut oil instead of olive oil, I also dry roasted the curries prior to adding the oil, onion, ginger & garlic. I let simmer for 15 minutes with coconut milk, then added yogurt, 1-large potato cut into chunks & chicken to simmer until potato & chicken were done. I only used 3 dashed of cayenne pepper, and finally a cup of frozen peas at the very end, let is simmer 5 minutes more and served with Basmanti rice and fresh melon. YUM!

Great curry. I pulled back on the curry a bit to keep it polite and added a bit more salt. Very nice.

It was good, however it had a bit of a chalky feel to it in the mouth.  I would do again though as the flavour was nice.  I would add some veg next time too.

I did not care for this recipe. I did exactly what the recipe stated, except I did 5 tbl of hot madras curry and I used Greek yogurt 0% fat. Im not sure if that is what added to the bitter pungent taste. It was very grainy as well like someone else stated. I made a new sauce with heavy cream and chicken broth and doctored it up with spices and that was edible, this was not. : (

Delicious!  We live in South America and were needing some comfort food.  This dish did the trick.  Will be making again.  As suggested by one reviewer, I dry roasted the curry and cinnamon first.  Was very flavourful.  Added a whole can of coconut milk, plus some plain yogurt.

Excellent recipe. I change the ratios on the recipe to my family's preference (as I suggest everyone does), and its a household favorite. It may not be "authentic" Indian food, but it tastes great. I recommend removing the sugar and tomato paste and adding vanilla and a bit of nutmeg. Also, I recommend pairing the dish with a nice Rum or Pina Colada instead of beer.

I really liked this recipe, with a a few changes. I added more of nearly every spice, along with black pepper. I also added carrots and potatoes to get more veggies in there. I also let it simmer for about 10 minutes longer to get all the veggies and chicken more tender. But this was a really helpful framework for a newbie to Indian cooking. My husband wanted seconds, which is always a big thumbs up for me!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Of course I made a few changes. I didn't add the cayenne pepper or the lemon juice. I cooked it for about 45 min until it thickened up. I also added some potatoes and frozen green peas.  A keeper.

We really enjoyed this recipe and added 1/2 cup of peas, 1/2 cup of grated carrots and two small diced potatoes.  I pre-cooked the chicken and par boiled the potatoes before adding.

I found the sauce a bit too thick and would suggest adding a cup of low sodium chicken stock.  

The spice was a tad too hot for me, but my husband really enjoyed it, especially with the naan bread recipe from this site.

I would definitely make this again!

This dish was fine, but I would definitely cut out the paprika, and swap the ground cinnamon with a 1 inch stick of whole cinnamon next time. The large amount to ground spices made the sauce in this dish a bit grainy. Also, next time I would add frozen peas and cooked chunks of russet potato to add a bit more vegetables, too.

Love it, I add quick boiled Russet potatoes (3 to 4 medium size) to this curry. Peel and boiled the potatoes for about 5 minutes, then let them cool and cut into bite sizes and add to the curry before adding the yogurt and coconut milk.

Excellent flavor.  Took Lwelkner's suggestion to increase curry (used 6 tablespoons) and used chili in place of cayenne.  Topped with steamed fresh peas for wonderful results.  Next time may increase to 8 tablespoons of curry.

This was my first time to make curry.  My boyfriend said it was great and asked what made it sweet tasting with the spicy.  I accidently bought cream of coconut instead of coconut milk so maybe that was it.  I thought it was just ok, but I don't love curry as much as he does.

great intro to Indian curry.  I like to use a heavy pan and sear the chicken after rubbing it with turmeric, salt and oil. scraping up all the browned goodness in the bottom of the pan will add a ton of depth to the flavor of this recipe. I also agree with those who add more curry powder and some chili powder.

One word WOW. This dish is a huge hit.... the mixture of spices created a wonderful spicy zesty sensation. This is a wonderful recipe that leaves you smiling. After this meal the peach soup is a nice palette cleanser and is refreshing!

I also add some turmeric at the time of adding the curry powder (gives it a slight extra boost in flavor, plus it's suppose to be good for you). We serve with jasmine rice and naan bread with olive oil drizzled over it and baked in the oven for 5-8 min. So good!

Don't know why I didn't listen to the negative reviews. The ingredients looked great. I love curry-but-I couldn't eat it. Followed recipe almost to a T. Left out lemon juice and added veggies as others suggested.  Sorry.

This was tasty, and I did enjoy it. However next time I will use some modifications. Less cinnamon, probably 1/2 Tsp, less coconut milk and as another reviewer said, MORE curry! ;-) All in all a good recipie.

Overall, I thought this recipe was delicious.  I had to make a few modifications, mostly due to the fact that what I had in my pantry differed slightly from what the recipe called for. Specifically, I had no fresh ginger root, so used 1 teaspoon of ground ginger, I had no cayenne pepper so used a pinch of red pepper flakes, I used the thicker, Greek-style plain yogurt.. And I also altered a few things due to our taste preferences... I used Sweet Smoked Hungarian paprika instead of regular, I used 2 chopped onions rather than 1, and we love the taste of cumin, so I added 1 teaspoon of that. This makes a very generous amount of sauce, so I was able to use more chicken and then have leftovers. This dish would also work very well with shrimp or even cut up vegetables. I served it over short-grain brown rice and it was amazing!!

Excellent recipe.  I added just a bit more ginger and more chicken, but that's just us.  I served it with Jasmine rice and had enough for one serving of leftovers - which didn't even last that long because 'somebody' snagged them fast.  I'll be making this again and double the recipe!

It was fine.  The family thought it was delicious.  I toned it down a little on the spiciness knowing that my dad and my nephew are not into spicy food.  Dad usually grumbles through anything indian.  I just used maybe half of the curry powder and didn't add any Cayenne or lemon juice.  I served it with banana raita from the moosewood cookbook.  mmmm

I tried this and though it smelled great the flavor and texture were off. The spices tasted raw and the texture was a little grainy. I cooked it for longer than the recipe says because I was making other dishes at the same time. Could the yogurt have curdled and cause the texture to be off? Has anyone else experienced this?

This dish is AWESOME!!! My boyfriend and I both absolutely loved it! The only changes we made were that we added 2 potatoes, skinned and cubed, and in addition to the yogurt we still ended up adding the whole can of coconut milk because after simmering for 25 minutes, the consistency was more paste-like and we wanted more sauce. It did turn out pretty spicy, but we both love spice so we didn't really mind. Be warned though, this dish is pretty heavy, and your eyes may end up being much larger than your stomach! :)

Disappointing. The sauce was thick and had an undesirable "grainy" texture. It was also too spicy--even my husband, who likes spicy food, said it was too hot and the hotness overpowered the curry flavor. I am willing to try this again, but this time I'm leaving out the yogurt, lemon juice and cayenne pepper.  Also, will try browning or searing the chicken before simmering it in the sauce. So, I will report back. Anybody have any suggestions about the grainy texture? Also, if I can get the sauce right, I think some good toppings would be: crushed pineapple, minced cilantro and/or chutney.

this is a good starting recipe. if you want authentic chicken curry you have to use authentic Indian curry powder. I personally use Javin curry powder that I get from our Asian market. If SWAD has a version available that brand is also pretty good, it might be available in the international section at Kroger.   Here are the changes I made: I added a whole can of coconut milk I used chicken legs without skin, cooked them with the onions and the spices (I doubled the ginger. Used 7 Tbs of curry powder). After the legs were a big brown, I added the can of coconut milk and cooked until they started to fall apart (yum bone marrow) I added veggies - 5 carrots, a head of cauliflower, and a box of sliced mushrooms.  I used ketchup instead of tomato paste I added a half can of water, and completely skipped the yogurt. Instead of sugar I used palm sugar, also called jaggery (you can get this at an Asian market) Finally what really makes it is curry leaves, I get these at - surprise - our Asian market, they really add the authentic flavor to it and it balances the spices. I didnt bother with the lemon at the end, i did follow someone else's tip to use Indian chili powder, which I threw in at the very beginning. This makes a spicy curry so if you want something more authentic with a little a@# kicking to it, follow my lead ;-)

This was a different flavor for my family.  They seemed to like it  though.  I really think it needed some red bell pepper, or something to add some heat.  Maybe some cayenne.  The only thing I did different was OMITTED the sugar.  It did not need it at all.  The coconut milk has sweetness of it's own.  It was really good with the coconut rice I made to eat it over. Yum.....Makes me want to try more "indian" recipes.

I make this often and consider it a favorite. The only change is I add the whole can of coconut milk, some cubed potato and small cauliflower pieces before the simmer stage. Serve with home made naan and different chutneys. Great! YUM!

Disappointed. Rough around the edges. Recipe was totally disappointing until the lemon juice was added which brought it around nicely. While I might prepare this dish again, it will be a while and I will continue to look for a chicken curry recipe that flows better than this one does.

We loved this!  I used more yoghurt than coconut and a heavy hand with spices. I liked how much "gravy" there was to flavor the rice.

This was good, just not as flavorful as we expected. I added quite a bit more of the curry powder, around 7 TBS and added a chopped Yukon Gold potato and some peas that I had on hand. I also added some more chili flakes. Definitely not "authentic Indian" but comes close and certainly isn't without taste.

Wow, soooooooooo good.  Hubby asks for this all the time.  Quite easy to make and so much better than the jarred sauces.

Excellent. Easy to prepare. Followed recipe except I also roasted the spices first, use a the whole can of light coconut milk. Served with spinach and jasmine rice. Even my very picky mother loved it.

My family wasn't crazy about this.  That doesn't mean it wasn't a good recipe.  To be honest, this was the first time we tried Chicken Curry.  I'm sorry for the low rating.  I really use the rating system to keep track of what we like and don't like.

Not terrible, but it doesn't taste anything like the curry I've had before.   The sauce is very grainy and it has a very generic flavor.   I'm not really sure why this is rated so high to be honest.

This recipe was delicious!!! My whole family, including my 7 and 3 yr. old, loved it! I did not have the plain yogurt and coconut milk on hand so I used 1/2 cup of regular 2% milk and a pina colada yogurt we had on hand. Also, I left out the cayenne pepper as I didn't want it to be too spicy. Still had plenty of warmth to the dish. This recipe is going in our box! Thank you so much for sharing.

I love curry but this was not good. I followed the directions exactly, no substitutions. After getting through his plate of it, my husband said he knew how much work I'd gone to in making it, but please never make it again.

This dish was incredible! It was very easy to make and my husband LOVED it. In his words, this dish has a whole lot of taste, but is not overwhelming or too spicy. He is a connoisseur of Indian and Middle Eastern food and said this was one of the best he's ever had. I left our the cayenne pepper because I did not have any on hand, but it still turned out great. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Very nice - easy prep, pretty goof-proof.  I needed a recipe for 40 (!), and this was very straightforward to make.  Fresh lemon in at the end, along with the cayenne, adds zip, but for people who are less adventurous, you can leave out the cayenne (or add less) and it still is flavorful.  A great find!

I've tried a few of the curry recipes on here and this is by far one of the better ones.  I doubled the recipe and added some additional curry and tossed in some broccoli at the end, but otherwise followed it pretty close.  Great sauce and the cayanne peper and lemon at the end definately adds a little something.  This has now been in my dinner rotation.  Mmmm MMMM

I took another reader's advice and added double the amount of curry powder. Unfortunately, I didn't add anymore liquid and ended up with a grainy mess. Taste wise, it was ok, but texture wise... ICK! I'm not sure if my boyfriend will let me make this again to fix my mistake!

INCREDIBLE!  I lived in India for six months and never had curry like this!!!  I followed the recipe except I added four potatoes and simmered for another 20 minutes to cook the potatoes.  Everyone said to add more curry, but I only added 1 more tbsp and a dash of turmeric.  The flavor was fantastic.  I also did not have tomato paste, but I read if you boil tomato sauce to let some of the liquid evaporate, then that will do just fine, and it did!  Some people may be afraid to add the sugar and the cinnamon, but really in the end all the spices blend soooo well and come together nicely.  Awesome recipe, and fairly easy.  Thanks!

I made it exactly as it was written, and it really didn't taste good.  Both my husband and I love Indian food, but this just didn't compare at all to anything you get at a restaurant.  Something about the recipe was off, but I don't know enough about those spices to pinpoint what it needed more or less of(It had nothing to do with it's degree of spiciness, just the general flavor and consistency).  I won't be making it again.  If you are looking for a good Indian recipe, I recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala on this site - it is delicious!

Yummers! That word doesn't even explain how good this recepie is.  I read all of the other Less than % star reviews and all I have to say is that they either don't like Indian food or haven't any taste buds.  My husband LOVED it also and we are not Indian!!  If you want your house to smell aromatic,cook this.  I cooked Basmati rice, added a little extra ginger about 1/8 tsp. of ceyenne pepper.  I also put in a little lemon juice and pepper at the end. Super Fantastic!! I also added some sweet pea's and cooked a sliced sweet patato for garnish.  Yummers!  Will definately save this and repeat again and again.    I thought this was better than an Indian restuarant, although we have none in Northern Maine.

It was hot but without much unique Indian flavor.  It was tangy, just okay.  It needed way more salt than I anticipated initially.  Just okay.  Not like the restaurants.  Naan was great and it was good to put it over rice.

I tried this with a couple of the other suggestions (extra curry powder, cooking the spices first) and found it to be kind of bland. I probably wouldn't make it again.

I loved this, but will not put in any of the lemon juice at the end the next time I make it.  It was all I tasted.  The recipe itself is fantastic - spicy and complex.  As good, if not better than the indian restaurant near my place. With the cayenne pepper I thought it was spiced just about right, but I do like my indian food hot.  As mentioned, serving 4 people with this recipe is pushing it.  Maybe 2 small kids and 2 adults, but 4 adults - no way.

I keep kicking myself for using an Indian recipe that called for cinnamon!  That was all I could taste, even with the heat of the other spices.  We strained the chicken out of the sauce, so it was still edible, but otherwise we were not pleased!

We LOVVVED this recipe.  We just tried Curry for the first time recently and couldn't wait to tasted again so i tried this because it seemed easy.  Wow!
I didn't have Coconut milk so i used a can of CocoLopez left from making PinaColadas so it was a little sweet so i added extra sour cream like others had suggested (no yogurt in the house)- it was so good - we were sopping up the extra sauce with bread.  Thanks for sharing!!

This curry is just to DIE FOR.  I seriously make this stuff once a month, it's that good!  It also freezes well, which is great because then I can enjoy this dish any time.

This was my first attempt at Indian Curry. I doubled all of the seasonings because it seemed too bland at first. The sauce came out thicker than expected despite increasing the liquid ingredients also, next time I think I'll add some water. To me this dish was missing something not sure what...it got an ok from my fiance which means I can make it again. I served over top of Basmati rice and sprinkled with cilantro before serving.

This recipe is the bomb. It has become our standard curry recipe and we make it pretty often. Guests always love it. It's pretty spicy as written, so decrease the cayenne unless you love it really hot. We love spicy, but full strength, it's a force to be reckoned with.

So good! Everyone said it looked and tasted as good as restaurant curries:) I did want to spice it up a bit so I added Sriracha hot chili sauce and a small can of crushed pineapples. Served it over basmati rice, soo good! Thanks for such an amazing recipe!

AWESOME recipe, though I of course made a few alterations:
Took the advice of some other reviewers and added a red pepper and a large potato (subsequently halved the chicken since you don't need as much with that much vegetable).  Also added more curry powder (5 tablespoons instead of 3), and for simplicity sake I used a small cup of plain yogurt (bout 1/2 a cup) and a whole can of coconut milk (bout 1 1/2 cup) instead of measuring stuff out.  Finally I used a whole teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of just half, for a little extra heat.
Enjoy!

Yummy!  So I didnt have everything so I had to modify (sorry).  I used almost 2tbsp curry(almost out) and for the rest used tumeric and cumin.  I didn't have an onion (would have made it better) so I added white kidney beans with the chicken.  I also upped the tomato paste(3 tbsp) a little and didnt used any coconut milk (healthier plus didnt have any). I also added about a cup of frozen spinach.  And at first I thought the cinnamon was too strong but after you add the lemon and cayenne pepper it milds it out, but I woul probally use less cinnamon next time.  Again sorry I changed so much but just shows this has great structure and you can modify easily.

I've made this recipe several times now; the spices are wonderful.  However I don't use the lemon juice - it totally ruins the taste in my opinion.  Recently I've added frozen green peas - YUM!!  Cashews also add a fabulous taste, and coconut cream is a great alternative for the coconut milk - makes it taste much more... coconutty. :)  But thanks for this great recipe, it's awesome for playing around & elaborating into something perfectly delicious!

This recipes was awesome!  I love how quick and easy it was to make and the flavor was perfect.  I omitted the tomato paste, lemon, and cayenne pepper - those ingredients weren't necessary.  I also used the entire can of coconut milk to make it saucier.  I'll make this again and again.

Wow...while the ingredients list may not look authentic, once you taste this curry you will think it's straight from an Indian restaurant!  The only changes I made was leaving out the cinnamon, and adding about 1 T. more of the curry powder, as well as some more coconut milk, just eyeball it.  Both my husband and I could not believe the smell and taste...it's just phenomenal!  I no longer have to search anymore for a good curry recipe.  Plus, this might be on of the easiest, hassle-free recipes I've ever made!

This is a great base recipe to work from, but the curry is a little weak.  I would recommend spicing it up a bit to your liking.  Easy and fast are it's great attributes!

My dad and I love this recipe and make it all the time! Also made it for my boyfriend and another friend who both raved about it. I've been to a few British and Indian restaurants that serve curries and I still prefer the one I make with this recipe. Wish I could rate this recipe even higher than five stars, because that's how much I enjoy it. I'm not an expert cook at all, but it is very easy to make and has come out great every time I've had it; it's now one of my favorite meals. 
My only complaint is that it does not make enough! So I usually end up doubling everything to get 8 servings, to which I then use a bit less onion (only 1), and a bit more garlic (6 cloves), cinnamon (2 and 1/4 tsp), ground ginger (1 and 1/4 tsp), and chicken (5 breast halves). 
I suggest you definitely try this curry at least once, but watch out you might become hooked on it like I am! ;)

Very yummy, extremely healthy, and a hit with the family! I didn't add any sugar, didn't use a bay leaf, used 3 chicken breast halves (and it was the perfect amount of sauce for them), and added only 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper. The aroma as the sauce and chicken were simmering made me nervous, because it smelled very yoghurty and cinnamony...I thought "is this going to be any good?" But after it was done and served over hot brown rice (with some tomato and green onions on top, as another reviewer suggested), I started hearing "mmm"s from the fam, and my first bite was scrumptious! I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for a pitch-in at work and it was a huge hit! I followed the suggestion of another poster and dry roasted the curry and other spices before adding the olive oil. It made a flavorful paste that coated my chicken nicely. I left out the sugar too. I put the seasoned chicken pieces, the yogurt milk mixture, the diced onions and a bag of lima beans in my slow cooker and cooked the whole thing on high for about 4 hours. It turned out perfect! This is something I will make again - at the request of my co-workers!

I've been making this recipe for quite some time now.  Its absolutely the best tasting chicken curry recipe out there.  The yogurt and coconut milk make all the difference. As a short cut to making it faster, I take all of the spices and portion them out in ziplock bags so that when it comes time to make it, I just grab one of the bags and I've got all of the spices ready to go.  Also, again to make it quick, I use ground ginger and powdered garlic.

Restaurant quality! Although I skipped the garlic, lemon and cayenne pepper and added peas and carrots. Also I used ground ginger instead of fresh. My husband, who's not fond of Indian cuisine, went for seconds.

At first I thought it will be horrible because i could smell the yogurt in it while it was still on the stove. But after about 30 min. the smell disapeared. It was very good. Just remember to open the windows because my house smelled like curry for 2 days.

This is one of our favorite recipes. I've actually used different meats (depending on what we've got): lamb, beef, or chicken as called for - they're all good! I use only 2 Tbsp of curry, but usually pop in 2 bay leaves. Also use 1 Tbsp of honey instead of sugar, and powdered ginger instead of grated fresh. If I have it I use coconut oil instead of olive oil (cooks much better at higher heat). Finally, have never added the lemon juice or cayenne pepper as it's spicy enough with the other ingredients for our taste (well, for mine - my husband would no doubt appreciate the added kick, but then I couldn't eat it!).

I made this 4/12/08. Probably the best curry recipe Ive tried so far. I stuck to the recipe except used boneless/skinless thighs. I used garam masala for the curry-I think thats what it meant. Served it with jasmine rice and steamed cauliflower. Husband said it was "really good" without being asked. I froze the other half a can of coconut milk- wonder if that will work?

Awesome recipe! My husband loves it and invites his friends over when he knows we are having this dish. 

I have added a few things. 3 potatoes cubed, 1/4C raisins, and 2 apples chopped. It is sooooo yummy!

This is a great recipe for curry chicken, especially if you play around with it a bit. I took the advice of some other reviews and I cooked 5 tablespoons or so of curry in the oil first for several minutes to get more of a paste consistency and to bring out the flavor. Then, I added the onion, 2 garlic cloves, dash of cinnamon, chicken, 1/2 tsp of fresh grated ginger root and some garam masala seasoning (about 1/2 tsp), 2 small plain yogurts, and added 3/4 to 1 cup of coconut milk. I didn't add lemon juice but added some cayenne pepper in the mix and sautéed it for approx 3 hrs. The longer you sauté everything, the better it will taste. Ideally, leave it in the fridge overnight, since it tastes even better the next day because all of the flavors have had time to blend. I would probably go light with the ginger root since I might have put too much in...the dish really had a ginger kick to it. I would even suggest to go with a dash of ginger seasoning instead. To thicken the sauce (it was a bit watery for my taste) I just added a tablespoon or two of flour and it thickened right up. It was amazing! It tasted just as it does in an Indian restaurant or better! I also used the Naan recipe found on here and together, this recipe was a huge hit with my guests! My boyfriend requested that I make it again and soon (since we didn't have any leftovers!) I would definitely eat this with either basmati or jasmine rice as well! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is just as good as my favorite Indian place.. I'd definitely roast my spices and I'd like to say you should absolutely use more chicken. It's enough sauce for probably 4 chicken breasts. I will definitely use more chicken...

I have made this several times and  always end up adding way more curry than the recipe calls for (I usually make it, then see how it tastes after 15 min of cooking and add what I think it needs). I also like to add yellow squash, okra or zucchini. And if I don't feel like opening a whole can of tomato paste, I use a real tomato and it still tastes great. Goes perfect with Naan. 
Good recipe:

Excellent curry dish that my family really enjoied, but 1/4 cup was a little to hot for us. Would only use 8 tsp. of curry and garnished with chopped green onions and diced tomato.

My whole family loved this dish even my 1yr. old ate it!!! Everyone asked for seconds, and that's a real accomplishment in a family of 7 because there is always someone who didn't like something. 
I would have liked more sauce for the chicken so I will just make a larger amount of sauce next time. 
Great recipe, thanks.

I cooked the meal using the 8 tablesooms of curry powder and thought that that ruined the meal. It was very powdery. I even added more milk and yogurt and it didn't help. I just don't like the powdery taste of this meal!

i tried this recipe last night and both my fiancee and i LOVED it!  we couldn't stop eating it!  i added a couple of potatoes, few carrots and a whole onion in it; mixed in a couple of chicken breasts with chicken wings.  everything cooked well together and extremely tender.  i didn't use any tomato paste nor have any yogurt, just added another 3/4 can of coconut milk.  we doubled the recipe and have some leftovers. we can't wait for have the rest of it tonight!

I'm sorry but this wasn't very good. I wonder if my McCormick's "Gourmet Collection" Curry Powder was the wrong kind to use.  There was something starchy about this curry.  My husband, who loves yellow curry, asked me not to make it again.

This was the best base for a Curry recipe I've found so far!  I prepared the dish following the original recipe--and it was delish enough--but I would take the suggestions of adding some additional curry powder and using Indian red pepper instead of cayenne into consideration next time!  My guests loved it and I cannot wait to experiment with this recipe some more.

This is a wonderful curry recipe. I substituted the coconut milk for another half a cup of plain (nonfat) yogurt with excellent results. I added approximately one teaspoon of honey to this recipe and omitted the lemon juice. The ingredients list was perfect for beginner cooks--I had all of the ingredients in my pantry except the coconut milk.

This recipe is fabulous!!! I have some older excellent recipes for curry, but this surpasses them all. I served at a recent dinner party using shrimp intead of chicken, and got rave reviews! I would not change a thing. Jasmine rice was the perfect rice to use with this great curry! Thank you, Amanda, for sharing!!!!

I added garam masala in place of the cinnamon and cayenne. This dish was alright. It was a little sweet for my taste. This review is biased because I've been trying (emphasis on trying), to replicate these amazing curries from my favourite (authentic) Pakistani restaurant with no success. I will keep trying. For those who are looking for a Western curry, this is a good recipe though.

This is the very first Indian dish I've ever made.  The recipe was easy to follow, simple, and come out quite delicious!  My husband loved it, was asking for leftovers the next night but there were none.  Definitely a keeper, I will be making again!

OMG!! what a wonderful recipe! So delicious!  Everyone adored it! Even though I was full I still kept eating because it was so yummy!! 

I added green, red, and yellow bell peppers, and also mushrooms. I wish i remembered to buy eggplant and carrots I would've added to the curry.

My husband and I both loved this recipe!.. Was easy to make too!.. Will definatley make again.  Probably when the kids aren't home next time; they are picky eaters and didn't care for the curry taste.  I Cut back the cayenne to a dash... Perfect!

This was great!  I followed the recipe with only a few minor variations.  I too followed Nadia's suggestion of roasting the curry first and added about a table spoon more to bring out the curry flavor. I did not use sugar and instead of plain yogurt I used vanilla flavored which gave it a natural sweetness without being too sweet.  I also used 3 tablespoons of tomato paste instead of just one.

I would HIGHLY recommend this recipe for anyone who loves curry dishes as well some who have yet to try curry chicken.

I made this for my family & friends at a dinner party, and I received rave reviews!!! However, I might omit a tad bit of lemon in the future, and I garnished it with cilantro, which was a nice touch. Overall amazing recipe!!

This recipe is a great starting point like many other reviewers have stated. I've only had curry once before and this one came close. I made this with a few changes I increased the curry to 4 Tbsp., used 1 1/2 Tsbp. tomato paste and used 1 c. of coconut milk. Although I didn't use the full amount of cayenne I  think next time I'll omit it completely because it was spicy enough on it's own. Next time I'll add some veggies to it.

Thanks for this recipe!

I normally wouldn't make anything quite like this, but my son asked me to and I thought that I'd give it a try. It was very foreign to my taste buds, but I really liked it alot! My son eats Indian food often & said that it wasn't the most exotic nor the spiciest he's ever had, but the very best! I will make this again for sure! Thanks for a great and different recipe!

It was a good recipe.  It lacked umph... I love Indian food, but this was just a bit bland.  I would try it again with some adaptations.

A very good recipe. I've tried a lot of curries, & this one was one of the best & easiest.
I did use garam masala, as suggested by some other reviewers, & cut back on the cayenne (by about half), but it was still plenty hot. One note about a previous review in which the person said it was sweet... Perhaps they used sweetened coconut milk by mistake? Just a thought, as it seems to me the only way this could come out tasting sweet. In any case, if you love curry & want an easy recipe, give this a try. It's delicious! I'm adding it to our list of regulars. Thanks for sharing, Amanda!

My husband is from Kolkata India and I made this dish in hopes that it would turn out as good as it looked but it didnt. It was sweet unlike the other indian foods I have cooked. Not planning on cooking this one again.

Wow!  This was fantastic!!!  I am impressed how well this turned out!  I made only a few small changes:  I added 2 extra Tbsp of curry powder, used Indian Chili powder (instead of the cayenne pepper), I used lite coconut milk and reduced the amount of lemon (per other reviewers) and this dish was wonderful.  I will definitely add this to my rotation to make on a regular basis!!!  Thank you!!!

I'm not much of a cook, but I as SO impressed to think that I cooked this when I tasted it!!!! I didn't use cardamon and I added raisins. I think the raisins were a great addition. Try it!

My first thought after creating this dish was..wow I really enjoy cooking.  It was a wonderful flavor sensation.  Then one minute later my mouth was on fire!  I love curry taste but it was tooooo hot.  Next time I will go very conservative with the powder.  But the flavor is just like my favorite Indian restaurant.

This was my first time  making any curry ever and it turned out pretty well.  All my friends who I served it to said it was good.  I doubled the curry powder and used a whole can of coconut milk.  I also added in peas and carrots.  Next time I'll try a teaspoon of garam masala, too.  It's really good with naan.

This is a terrific recipe.  Tasted just like in the restaurants in our 'Little India'.  I made the following changes:  added 4 tablespoons on curry powder and 1 teaspoon of garam masala. I also used the entire can of coconut milk and added some green pepper to get some veggies into the meal. Served with basmati rice and naan and it was a fantastic meal! Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good! I followed a reviewer's suggestion and browned the curry in a hot pan. I think I would cut down on the amount of cinnamon though. I also used a whole can of coconut milk and let it simmer longer in order to thicken up. Very authentic and yummy!

This was DELICIOUS. My husband, son and I are avid fans of Indian food and this recipe was just as good if not better than our favorite Indian restaurant! I'm so glad that I found it. I did not stray from the recipe at all, except to save the cayenne pepper to add later as it would be too spicy for our 3 year old. I served it with basmati rice (garlic and ginger recipe) and easy and quick homemade raita. IT WAS ALL SO SO YUMMY.

This is a great recipe - Much like what you'd get in an Indian restaurant...The only thing I did differently was I used skinless chicken breasts and legs (with bones), since I find the boneless breasts to be too dry, even if cooked for a while in the sauce.  I fried the chicken parts first in the oil with the onions, then made the rest of the recipe as suggested, but I did let it simmer on low heat (covered) for about 2 hours until the meat was falling off the bone.  I then just picked the visible bones out and discarded.  It really brought the flavors together.  Using a good quality curry powder will probably help those who thought the flavor was just soso.

This is my first time making anything with curry or Indian food. Instead of using coconut millk I used soy milk (thought I would cut down on the fat and calories) and instead of plain yogurt I used low fat coconut flavored yogurt. I did not add the cayenne pepper because it was plenty spicey without it I thought. I also thought it had too much of a cinnamon flavor but it didn't stop me from eating it:)It was also sweet but that might be from using the flavored yogurt. But I would make this again.

3/8/2006  I guess I'm still looking for the perfect chicken curry with coconut milk.  This was pretty good, but just not...quite...right.  I'd try it again, though; just do some tinkering with the spices.  It tasted just a little bland.
9/1/2011 Changed my mind!  Followed another reviewer's tips:  Used a whole can of coconut milk because I didn't have any yogurt, a chunked up potato added along with the chicken and peas added along with the lemon juice.  Was a little bit freer with adding the spices, and used a spicier curry powder.  Used powdered ginger and added some garam masala.  Really delicious!  Served with my favorite plain naan bread from Trader Joe's.

I really changed this recipe around. I used a whole chicken cut up into 4 pieces, doubled the sauce part of it. (excluding the tomato paste I didn't have any) I poured the sauce over the chicken pieces and marinated overnight, then baked at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. Served it with brown rice and some steamed brocolli. We both loved it and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I agreed with previous members in that it needs some veggies in the recipe...not sure which ones though.

As someone who hasn't done much cooking, I found this recipe relatively easy to follow. Overall, I'd say everything turned out well but I didn't find the taste to be as rave worthy as most of the previous posters. It was good, but not anything I was wowed by, though my parents liked it very much.

The recipes lends itself well to tweaking, for personal tastes so I might try it again and play around some more. I used a full cup of coconut milk and subsituted the yogurt for sour cream. I DID note that you don't need all the lemon juice that's called for. I'd probably cut it down next time.

This was a good jumping off point - a little bland to the eye but delicious. I'll definitely add color - peppers, zuccini - next round. Added fingerling potatoes cut into 3/4" chunks. Yum!

We thought this was really good.  There was a grainy something to the texture that we couldn't quite figure out; other than that, it was quite close to the curry we've had at our favorite Indian restaurant.  Thanks!

This is great!  Tastes like something you could order at a fancy Indian restaurant.  I am glad I didn't let the coconut milk ingredient scare me off.  Turns out it was easy to find.  I highly recommend this one!  Oh- I almost forgot, I added twice as much chicken as called for and there was planty of sauce for it all.

I loved this recipe! A wee bit spicy for me, so I think next time I might cut back on the cayenne, and maybe saute some apple chunks with it. A very good recipe, and one I'm defintely keeping.

Such an awesome recipe. I had leftover roasted chicken from the night before, so I pulled a comparable amount and simmered it closer to the end. A little too spicy for my personal taste, but all that needs is adjustment in the cayenne pepper at the end.  Awesome with jasmine rice and the Naan recipe here.

I pretty much followed the recipe without any modifications and I thought it was only OK.  The flavor is interesting, but it's nothing like any curry I've had at a restaurant.  I probably won't make this again since it wasn't what I was really looking for.

I just fixed this last night, and I must say that it was absolutely fantastic!  It tastes much like the local Indian food restraunts.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  I'm going to use this again in the future!

I've been using this great site's recipes for a long time but this is the first time I had to rate one.  This recipe was right on!  I didn't change a thing and it was delicious, my husband is impossible to cook for and said it wasa definite keeper!.  Thanks.

Very nice.  I left out the sugar and used chicken thighs rather than breasts and, come to think of it, forgot the lemon juice and cayenne but added fresh cilantro.  My husband really liked it--suggested I make a big pot at the start of the week.

Excellent. I have no experience whatsoever cooking Indian food (though I eat it pretty often), and this recipe was incredibly easy and 100% "idiot-proof". The only modification I made to the original recipe was that I used a little less lemon juice (though I did use some) and no onion. I served it with Basmati rice, and my sister and her friends ate everything, no left overs at all! I will most definately be making this again.

great recipe - definitely a keeper.  I was forced to use cream of coconut, which made it very sweet, but I also didn't have lemon juice, which I think would have cut the flavor very well.  very fragrant and so easy!

This recipe was excellent.  I usually double the recipe and then freeze the left overs (it freeze's great).  What's great about this recipe is you can add more curry or spices to your liking.  Everytime I make it, the house smells of the great aroma of curry and my boyfriend loves it.  Thanks for recipe!!

I was really looking forward to this, but the dish didn't deliver -- to my taste, at least. Adding raisins provided a sweet counterpoint to the recipe's heavy, flat tang ... so I'll give it another try. Next time I'll also add apple slices and brown sugar, as another reviewer suggested, and hope for the best (or at least better...)

I've had Indian curry before and this is very similar to "butter chicken" that I've had - could be the same thing.  I found this recipe to be a bit more sour than I liked.  Next time I'm going to try to use less yogurt and nix the lemon juice at the end.  Otherwise, it turned out pretty good.

I feel like my rating isn't fair because I have never had Indian curry before.  I have always loved Thai Curry - so I thought I would like this.  Nope....I don't like cinnamon in my cooking unless it is for cookies or cinnamon sugar toast.  The consistancy was wonderful though, and the chicken was very moist.

This was exactly what I was looking for:  A hearty chicken curry recipe, full of flavor, heat - without having to buy a lot of expensive ingredients that I didn't already have in my panntry.  My only recommendation?  Needs salt.  Other than that, this recipe is definitely a keeper.

My wife and I enjoyed this very much.  She is new to Indian food, and found it a touch on the spicy side.  Next time, we might cut back a little on the cayenne and ginger.  We'll make it again!

This was delicious.  I added some potatoes, cauliflower and a few green beans.  I also added chicken broth so my spices wouldn't burn in the pan so it ended up being saucier but the chicken was shredding.  Mmm... so good.

I loved the recipe because it is easy to do. Since we don't like bay leaves I let that out. I find cayenne too hot if uncooked so instead of adding it at the end I add it at the start

It was a little to hot for my taste. But maybe the left overs will be better after the flavors meld. I would make it again but I would add peas.

Love this quick and easy recipe 
But I add more Cayenne pepper because I like my curry just a little bit spicier, and also no yogurt I used heavy whipping cream instead, for delicious

Cooked this meal and tasted it 30 minutes ago. 

I followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, it didn’t taste great. I feel like if I had more experienced taste buds, I could alter the recipe to my liking. Since I don’t, I likely won’t try this one again.

Very good recipe. Easy to make and the family loves it. I use chicken thighs and add more curry powder. One trick I do is I make it the night before and refrigerate it so it all mells together. Most of the time not all of it makes it to the next night. I then reheat it and serve with jasmine rice. Regarding heat, more cayenne is good, but my wife doesn’t like as much heat as my sons and so we add hot sauce like a good scorpion sauce or habanero.  I’ve turned other people onto this recipe specifically in my cooking club and all have thoroughly enjoyed it. I think next time I make it, tonight, I’ll try frying the spices like the one reviewer said.

Great for meal-prep. I first toasted the seasonings separately as others suggested (though I still used the powered stuff).  I also sauteed the chicken separately, browning it and creating a fond in the pan, in which I then cooked the rest of the dish.  Tweaked the seasoning ratios to my taste.

I made it because of the many 5 star reviews. I'm not an amateur cook and I followed it exactly.  It turned out bitter and gritty. I'm not sure where the bitterness came from, maybe the cinnamon? No idea. I think the order of cooking is incorrect as well - hence the gritty texture. Do yourself a favour - if you're going to make it, make sure you read all the reviews before doing so.

I have 3 other favorite curry recipes, one by an Indian Chef.  I have to say, this one is my favorite.  I added mushrooms and red bell peppers that I sautéed with the onions.  I could see how it would work using vegetables of your choice.  I even thought about making it with tofu and vegetables. I don't see how anyone can give it one star.  It's delicious.

Love this recipe!  Shared it with some friends.  They loved it so much I had to teach them how to make it.  They use to travel over a hour to get to a favorite restaurant in order to have Indian Curry.  Not any more!

I really liked this. I read a bunch of reviews, but still followed the recipe as it's written. I prefer to do it that way first, then tweak if I feel like it in future. As with most curries, the flavours develop more with standing. I'll definitely make this again.

We loved this curry,  I made a few changes lightly sautéed the chicken pieces and then onion, garlic and then added a couple TBSP of butter and added the dry spices before adding the liquids.  it was a hit with the family.

I'm sorry, I don't get it.  I followed this recipe and it was a disaster.  The dry ingredients never mixed smoothly into the yogurt/coconut milk, so the final product had a grainy rough texture.  And it had a really bitter taste that was just plain off.  I love Indian and Bengali  restaurant food, but this wasn't even close.  It tasted almost like there was way too much curry powder.  Or something.  And the chicken seemed a bit over-cooked.  I won't say it was inedible, but it was leaning in that direction.  I put the remains in the refrigerator, but I think I was just being polite; probably throw them out by day after tomorrow.  By the way, this was my first attempt ever to cook Indian cuisine.

Pretty good.  The chicken was a little chewy.  It might be better in the crock pot or instapot.  Instead of yogurt I used one can of coconut milk and used 2 lbs of chicken.  Forgot the lemon juice and cayenne.  I would add next time because it wasn't that spicy.

When i was little my grandma would make chicken curry with all these little dishes filled with different condiments. I loved how you could make your curry so individualized with chutney and chopped nuts and green onions coconut and I forget what else she would put on the table.  
I made my own cucumber yogurt dish and added raisins as well and I loved how it turned out.

Delicious and super easy to make! We like the heat, so I used hot paprika. Combined with the curry and cayenne, it hit the heat meter. Throw it on some good basmati rice with steamed broccoli, and you’ve got yourself a great meal.

Just writing this review is making my mouth water all over again.  This is a delicious dish!  The only change I made was reducing the red pepper to 1/4 tsp as I knew more would be too hot for my husband.  Still had a nice kick.  Looking forward to making it again.......easy and fantastic.

Quick and easy.  Very flavorful.  I used only 1/4 tsp cayenne and used chicken thighs as that is what I had on hand.
I made it a second time using chicken breasts and thighs for a large group.  It was good served over basmati rice and received compliments.

I used full fat coconut milk but, otherwise I followed the recipe as written (well, I doubled it too) and took it to a church dinner. It was excellent!  Will be making it again for ourselves, as my husband and I both loved it. Thank you for sharing

I made this for my family of teens and preteens. It was enough serving for four. I would double it if my husband had been home, then there would be enough for him as well as lunch leftovers. I omitted the cayenne since we like things mild.

My new favorite curry recipe. I didn't have plain yogurt, so replaced it with equal part of sour cream (mixed with juice of half lemon). Also didn't have fresh ginger, so used ground ginger. You can't taste the cinammon in the recipe, but it compliments everything ! Love it!

We had this for dinner tonight with rice and roasted root vegetables; it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.
You might want to season to taste with the cayenne to the heat level you prefer.

My daughter made this today and it was really tasty if a bit thick. I was expecting a funnier sauce. Flavors were great. Husband and daughter didn't care for the cinnamon flavor but I didn't mind.

Great recipe! I did add some potatoes and carrots just to help boost the flavor. I omitted the lemon though becuase the curry had enough sourness from the yogurt already. I also added some black peppers, cumin, a bit more salt & sugar, and chicken flavored broth mix to add some oomphs to the already great tasting dish. Will definitely make again!

Good basic recipe but it turns out bland to my taste. It feels like there is an important flavour missing from it, so you definitely have to add something else to it to bring it to the next level.  This turns out spicy (hot) too so I wouldn’t add any more of the spicy seasonings.

This has great flavor, although I did not include the pepper (my family is pepper adverse).  I added two extra table spoons of curry powder and triples the coconut milk.  We like our curry saucier and served over rice.

I also added a can of sliced potatoes since my son loves it that way.

This recipe is delicious!  This deserves 5 stars.  I wouldn't change the recipe then give it a low rating.  It's now fair.  You can make this exactly as instructed or change it up to make it your own.   I followed the instructions as stated however I wanted to add some vegetables to the dish.  I had a zucchini and a ripe tomato (skin off)  that I cut up and, (peeled) cubed white sweet potato and added to the dish at the end of the cooking time (last 10-15 minutes).  I served this with whole grain naan.   I'll definitely make this again.   Thank you for sharing!

Having never made or even eaten curry chicken before I wasn't sure what to expect. I followed the recipe exactly and served it over jasmine rice. I thought it was pretty simple to make, it smelled wonderful during cooking.  When we were eating it thought there seemed to be a lack of any real flavor standing out. Sure there was the heat from the cayenne but that was really about it. Glad we tried it though, we always enjoy trying new food

Very good!  We have been craving curry and were hoping to somewhat duplicate the authentic chicken curry that our friends served us.  This comes pretty darn close.  I will probably add a tish more red pepper next time, but really good tasting recipe.  We prefer a lower card diet, so I served over cauliflower rice.  yummy

Quick and Easy with a real authentic kick..... To chill it a little try leaving out the Cayenne pepper at the end or serve with a fresh side of natural greek style yogurt.... Curried up rated 8 out of 10....!

This is delicious! The only changes i made was to omit the cayenne (I didn't have any) and I added about a tablespoon of honey at the end. It really rounded it out nicely and my family loved it... even my 8 year old! I served it over basmati rice and with homemade naan and tzatziki sauce. Sooooooo good! Thank you!

Really awesome, wife and toddlers loved it, very easy and quick to prepare.  Great base recipe to change up the way you like. I definitely agree, go easy on the lemon juice at the end, start with half the quantity, than add from there.  I added some cream after I took it off the heat, didn't curdle but didn't do much for the flavor/texture either. I would also recommend putting the chicken in half way through simmering, definitely don't want to overcook it.  Added a bag of frozen peas for some vegetable goodness, omitted the pepper and each person added sriracha to their plate as needed, worked just as well. Will make again very soon!

Excellent recipe!  Reduced the lemon juice and white sugar by half and added 1/2 cup of raisins.  Will try the Indian chili powder next time.  Added a teaspoon of garam masala.  Served with basmati rice.

Was defrosting some organic Kirkland chicken thighs and legs and wanted to change how I made it. Look through my spice cabinet and found Bombay curry that I bought at Chelsea market in Manhattan. Had almost everything except for fresh ginger and when I got back with that I produced this same dish. Was delicious and added more Cayanne pepper as we like it hot. Also discovered we had no yogurt so we use sour cream which was an adequate substitute.  Served it with couscous rather than rice. Will definitely favor and make this again.

Nice over all-I love the coconut milk and yogurt.  Spices good.  Be cautious when adding lemon, too much can't be fixed.  Can always add more.  I finished mine off with some frozen peas and chopped cilantro.

I’ve made this twice. Both times it’s been amazing. I added a little more coconut milk the second time and a different brand of curry powder that didn’t have as many spices in it. That made the second time less spicy which I was A OK with!! This recipe needs probably twice the salt also.

I'm not Indian, so no idea what authentic Indian Curry should taste like. However, I love this dish! I added green beans, red bell pepper and zucchini to make it a more complete meal. Awesome over Jasmine rice!

Overall, a great recipe! Very easy to make, lovely aromas while cooking, and extremely tasty. Be warned, though, that this is a very, VERY spicy dish. While I like spicy, even I thought the spice quotient was a tad much, and other family members had some trouble handling it. I will definitely make this dish again, but plan to cut all the spices by half (making it a 5-star meal for sure).

I made this last night and won't make it again...not because it was awful, but because we are just not curry eaters.  Thought I'd try it, because I was looking for something new, and we did eat it, we just didn't love it.

Generic chicken Curry, tasty and a bit spicy.
Next time might add some cashews and or veggies to make it more interesting 
Anything with curry and coconut milk has to be good!

No changes.  If we make it again, we will not use the tomato paste.  Prefer the yellow chinese curry. these spices seem to cancel one another out.

Only had Chicken Curry from our local Chinese place....I wanted to try real, so I made this recipe.  I don't like it, none of the three of us here liked it.  The amount of spice left a chalky feeling in your mouth and it was just not very good.  Maybe we just aren't curry people, or maybe it's an acquired taste.

I cooked this for lunch today and the household loved it! Thank you for this. I did use palm oil instead of olive oil like somebody suggested. Then I added some chicken wings with the cubed breasts but I had to cook the wings a little longer. Served it with plain steamed rice. My what a hit!

Turned out great. I was lacking paprika so I left it out. Also lacked yogurt and tomato paste. In their place I used a few tablespoons of diced tomatos in a can with some of the juice and sour cream. Turned out just fine and my 21 year old son ate every last bite.

Excellent curry recipe. We've cut back on the cayenne or even went without any cayenne whatsoever and it still has great flavor. I've made it twice in the space of a month.

All I had on hand was red curry, so I substituted it instead of yellow.  I also added more coconut milk and some peanut butter.  I garnished it with fresh chopped cilantro and served it with naan bread.  I'll make it again!!

Really quick and easy way to get a delicious sauce with the perfect consistency.  Leaving the chicken to simmer for 25-30 minutes can make it slightly overcooked.  I would sear the chicken, cut it up, then add it about halfway through simmering.  I also would use a spice blend instead of curry powder.  Some mixture of cumin, cardamom, turmeric,  and mustard seed should do.  I also used ground scorpion peppers instead of cayenne, but this made it quite hot.  

As is, the recipe is still great and versatile.  Tweak it as you see fit, but keep the base of onion, garlic, spice, yogurt, tomato paste,  coconut milk, and ginger.

Pretty good recipe. I did make some tiny changes. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt, added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste instead of 1, three bay leaves instead of 1 and lastly used half a can of coconut milk instead of the 3/4 cup. Overall, a delicious recipe!!

I found this curry easy and quick to make. The flavour was fantastic. I did use chicken thighs that had been brined and I ommitted the cayenne pepper at the end as my DH doesn't like his food too spicy. The mm's coming from him were enough to make this a winner in our house.

This was really good curry. I sliced the chicken thinly and cut into bite-sized pieces, and halved the cayenne pepper, but was still a little hot for my son.  Once I had all the ingredients prepped, it went together surprisingly quickly.  I had some cooked carrots which I sliced and added at the very end.  I think more vegetables could also be added, just cook first.

This was tasty but needs more curry flavor.  I did not have paprika on hand and so substituted 1/4 tsp. cayenne for the paprika...otherwise followed the directions exactly.  The flavors were too mild for a really good curry so next time will add more curry powder.  Hubby liked it but, like me, thought the curry flavor was too mild.

I substituted fresh spices for dried spices except the garlic. I drank a glass of white wine.  I substituted a cup of milk with sweetened coconut flakes for the coconut milk. So, for a weekday night, coming up with a dinner without leaving the house, this is a dynamite recipe.  It's not even half bad for company either.

I put the whole thing in the pressure cooker for 8 minutes! I left out the cayenne (kids don't like it) and ran out of Curry so I used half Curry and half Garam Masala and a dash of Cumin. I almost forgot the lemon juice but remembered at the end. It def brought out all of the flavors so don't forget the lemon juice!! Poured the whole thing over brown rice and yum!! I like it better then the Indian Butter Chicken I usually make.

This was great!  Read through some of the comments and since I love spicy/savory, I started with cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, etc. ... a little more curry ... served with a saffron rice and al dente green beans!  Talk about a Spicy/Sweet/Savory hit!  No leftovers tonight!  We'll definitely keep this one in the recipe box.

Pretty good, but not my favorite recipe. I have never used tomato sauce in curry before, and seems to be lacking mustard seeds.

This is one of my favorite meals, and this recipe met the expectations. I didn't have coconut milk or plain yogurt, so I used half regular milk ( I ran out) half rice milk, and light sour cream instead. I also followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and added about four extra tablespoons of curry powder, and left out the lemon and cayenne. I also added about a tablespoon of Garam Masala. Overall it was a delicious meal that satisfied even the pickiest eaters of my house.

It's a great recipe! I was quite happy with the results. Although I would add just a bit of sugar for a touch of sweetness, and also to break the acidity. Other than that I was very happy with the recipe.

So full disclosure, not a lemon fan. Like at all. Only like lemon in my desserts. But I LOVE Indian food,  so I was scared of this recipe. After the 25 minute simmer, I wasn't impressed with the flavor...added the lemon and let it simmer, and I'll be! It was great. The acid in the lemon sure opened up the flavors and brought it all together. Definitely worth a try.

Washed the chicken with lemon juice first. Made it with sour cream instead of yogurt, didn't have any plain yogurt at the time. Added 1 more tablespoon of curry. Came out delish. Although too saucy, I'll use half the sour cream and coconut milk next time. Thanks for this recipe!!

We've made this many times, just as written. Delicious! We've also traded out the chicken for sautéed tofu when we're having a meatless night or served over brown rice if we want to feel like we're being healthy. Still, delicious.

I read through the other reviews before making this and used some of the suggestions. I toasted the spices first, used a whole can of coconut milk, and added half a bell pepper. I also used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. I didn't have yogurt so I used sour cream instead. Instead of cayenne pepper, I threw in some dried chilies which I removed along with the bay leaf before serving. I didn't add lemon however I used lemon olive oil. This was delicious and so easy! I'll be making this again!

I have made this 6 or 8 times now and I love it. I follow the directions exactly as written EXCEPT I cut the curry powder in half because it packs a little more heat than I'm used to.  I serve it over quinoa. Really wonderful paired with the curry. 5 stars

I made the mistake of using vanilla yogurt which rendered this as just weird. Worth making again with PLAIN yogurt and cut back a bit on the the cayenne per my wife.

This was so great! I didn't take any suggestions from any other reviewers, but maybe next time I will add some green peas.  My husband drags me to the indian restaurant at least once a week (more if he could) and he said this was better than theirs!  It's probably not 100% authentic, but it is still a very good meal.  We will definitely be making it again.  8 WW Smart Points if anyone is wondering.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I followed this recipe without making any changes other than using chicken thighs and cutting the cayenne pepper in half-- and it was delicious.  I've made different curries before, and I will add this to my list of recipes to definitely make again.  Simple ingredients and quick to make!  Perfectly served with basmati rice.

I left out the cayenne pepper and lemon juice and added more curry. I also waited to add the chicken towards the end, which left it juicy and flavorful. This was delicious and tasted authentic.

Followed this recipe fairly close, however i did double everything. Turned out amazing!! I would suggest to not double the olive oil. I did strain quite a bit of it out. 
One other thing i was unsure of was to cook or not to cook the chicken before adding to the mixture. For the first time ever I added the chicken to a sauce raw. I simmered for 20 minutes, the chicken was cooked, tender and melt in your mouth. I'll definitely use this technique in the future. Instead of Curry powder i used about 2 tbsp of green curry paste and garnished with some cilantro at the end. I loved it, my wife loved it will definitely make again very soon

I found it was kind of bland except for the extra cayenne I added. Seemed it was missing a spice or maybe just needed to add more of certain spices. And I should have added potatoes/peas/cilantro as well. It was ok, but not great like the Indian food I've tasted. Would make again but would tweak also with input from other recipes.

Delicious. I've made this recipe several times. I like to make it according to the directions and then transfer everything to the slow cooker for a couple of hours before serving (you could also simmer on low, I suppose). The flavors meld really nicely that way. Yogurt adds a great mildly tangy flavor. Recommended!

First time I made this recipe, I halved the cayenne pepper and it was still way too much.  So I only put in a couple dashes.
I also use half yellow curry powder, half red curry paste.
Lastly I use the entire can of tomato paste and coconut milk when making a double batch, and I always make a double batch so I can have lots of leftovers.

Very tasty!  My whole family enjoyed it, although I left out the cayenne pepper and subbed black pepper in it's place for the little one's palette.  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first time cooking anything with curry and it turned out amazing!  I made it with couscous because I didn't have rice.  It was a great match!!  I'll be making this dish again!

I've made this recipe many times, and I can confidently say that this recipe, after all ingredients are mixed together, comes out best when left on a simmer for at least 45 minutes. The more patience, the more the spices bloom. I also found that is very important to only brown the chicken, the texture is incredible when id=s cooked fully in the broth. I also try to avoid getting as much chicken broth in as possible.
Some more tips: add the yogurt when the recipe says, but never let the recipe reach a full boil after, this will break the broth. It's ok for there to be bubbles.
Stir very often, but for the most part just let it do its stuff.
Vegan alternatives: Steamed (but not fully cooked) cauliflower to replace the chicken, and even amounts coconut cream to replace the yogurt. Follow the recipe as usual.

Love this recipe!  The only substitution I make is to use plain Greek yogurt as I can buy it in individual serving sizes.

This is so Good!!! But, Lets be honest, I never have coconut milk or yogurt so I substitute it with plain milk and sour cream. I was even out of tomato paste so I used a tablespoon of ketchup. lol It worked just fine. Completely delish! Also you can eat it with petas.

Great recipe!! Use fresh spice ingredients when possible to get the most of the flavor... I too added additional curry powder (4-5 Tbs total) to increase the spice and is it good!  I've used Penzi's Hot Curry blend as well as Sharwood's hot curry powder and both were equally good, go with Sharwoods on cost!  Also, I added fresh cilantro in addition to the last add of cayenne and lemon juice which is a huge boost as well.  You can get away with using Vanilla yogurt in place of the plain, just be careful not to add the additional sugar.  This difference also took out some of the heat I noticed.  I found out about this recipe from my friends wife who is Indian, this recipe is a game changer I can't get enough!

I am always uncomfortable with using curry powder because it has a very strong specific taste, although the lemon and cinnamon in it made it really good. I put all the ingredients together in a bowl and used greek yogurt instead of the natural one. If you let the chicken cook a little first and then add the ingredients it works perfectly.  I also added bell pepper slices, basil,  and tomato slices (very thin) and let them soften inside while the chicken and sauce were cooking. Super good, its definitely open to small changes according to taste.

I added 4 times the suggested amount of curry, it didn't have that strong curry taste I've grown to love eating at our local authentic Indian diner. I also substituted sushi bottled ginger in juice; drained and chopped.
It was a great hit! Everyone loved it! It was easier to make than I expected.

I truly enjoyed this dish! Mind you, I changed a few small things; such as using:
1 tsp of Ginger
Light Vanilla Yogurt instead of plain (To make it a little sweeter)
Milk instead of Coconut milk (cause I am not a fan)
A little bit of 10% Cream to your taste
1 tsp of Indian Cayenne Pepper instead of Just North American Chilli/cayenne Powder
Lastly I added a tablespoon of butter

We had for dinner tonight and I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I loved it but my son wasnt as crazy about it.  I went outside while it was simmering and the house smelled terrific! I'll be making it again for sure.  It was easy, economical and a one pot dish.  Can't beat that

This was a really easy recipe. The only changes I made were, I added 4 cloves of garlic(I love garlic) and I added 1/2 Tablespoon of Garam Masala for a little extra punch.  My family loved it and are already requesting it again!!

I skip the yogurt because my son is allergic to dairy. I also add chicken stock. This recipe is a winner! It's my husband's favorite! The kids eat them, too. Even my 2yo.  I just go easy on the cayenne. :) I also add carrots and potatoes. My family likes it that way.

I stir fried red bell pepper and then added 10 min before finished cooking. Added 1 tablespoons cumin, and only 1 tsp salt, plus 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1 tsp cinnamon ( in lieu Garam masala). Fried onions and spices then added chicken to cook. Served over jasmine rice with naan. Also added shredded spinach with the bell pepper.

I followed the recipe, with some of the suggested modifications ( using a cinnamon stick, cloves, regular cooking oil as opposed to olive oil, more curry, etc.) For the heat, I used a hot pepper (jalapeno, I think, because that's what I had on hand.) Well, it tasted really delicious, but, I REALLY overdid it with the heat! Will make this again and back off on the pepper, then. I suspect, it will be a 5 star.

This is so good, although I added a little more of the spices because I love spices, it turned out really good for my first try, I also added turmeric powder. I love the smell of cumin powder, I added a little extra. To turn this into a soup blend your fresh ingredients together first , like your garlic, onion, fresh ginger and tomatoes. Recipe ask for ginger powder and tomato paste, I used fresh tomatoes and fresh ginger.

I did not use that much cayenne pepper, felt 1/2 tsp would be way too much.  When fed to my sister, who makes indian and pakistani food very well, she said, it wasn't hot enough for her....It was hot enough for me, I barely put in 1/8th of a teaspoon.  I would add more chicken as well, perhaps three chicken breasts...the chicken tends to shrink.
Recipe was easy to make and tasted good.  It satisfied my indian curry craving.

I love this recipe, I always return to this as a bases to my curry chicken. Everyone has different taste bud, so the recipe should be used as a basis ONLY. 

If anyone enjoys cooking, then they automatically know we will always add our own twist by adding a little more of this and that to cater to our taste buds, and in doing so - I also add potatoes to my recipe. :-)

Thank you for sharing!

I didn't care for this to much at all. I omitted the cayenne pepper because I don't like my food too spicy.  I also used half and half cream - no coconut milk on hand but added some shredded coconut to compensate. The curry powder I used was Sharwoods medium strength.  I don't expect to try  this recipe again I found the taste slightly bitter.

Great recipe.  Made curry for the fist time and took suggestions from previous reviews and added 8 Tbsp of curry and 3/4 tsp of fresh ginger.  Crowd pleaser. Next time I'll add chickpeas and peas.

I love this recipe however I have some suggestions. First, VEGETABLE oil is the absolute best to cook curry in. It lets the spices breathe. I know those calories stack up but it really is the best for all curry recipes. You can make it up on the calorie end by using light coconut milk.
 I recommend using 2 tbls and if you need more add it in as you go but for this amount of chicken, no more than 3 tbls. You want to cook the onion and curry together for about 10 minutes to bring out the flavor. You will see the difference in how the curry interacts with the oil if you used Olive oil before.  Curry paste is the best. If not, the powder is fine. You can add the rest of the spices, garlic and ginger in together and then cook for another 10/15 minutes. I know this adds on time but its worth it. The spices need to cook to create the best flavor. Also, don't be shy with the ginger. It gives it a nice kick. Next, brown the chicken in the spices. 15 minutes should do it. THEN add in the yogurt, tomato paste, coconut milk etc. I do not remove the bay leaf but I do add in the lemon. And thats my variation on this recipe. Same thing but cooked a little different.

The first time I tried this, I pretty much mucked it up.  The spices burned some, I made it in a cast iron skillet and it just wasn't quite "right."  But I have learned from my mistakes, starting with using my enameled cast iron instead. I omitted the onions, mixed the spices together in a small dish (increasing the curry, sugar and adding 1/2 tsp of cardamom), heated the oil on medium, then turned it down to low before adding the spices all at once and stirring constantly so as not to burn. After the 2 mins, I added the chicken and turned up the heat up to between medium and high heat while stirring in the tomato paste, the yogurt and 1 cup of coconut milk. Once boiling, I dropped the heat and follow the remaining instructions.

Made this last night and fell in love! Although I used chicken thighs instead of the breast, the sauce was heavenly. We like it spicy so I added a lot of Cayenne but that's all just flavoring to taste. This is a KEEPER!

Good starter curry recipe. I like that it's a "one pot" recipe and the ingredients are accessible. Very easy to make substitutions and additions -- I used mushroom and zucchini in place of the chicken for a friend who is vegetarian. I would skip the lemon juice, or just add to taste. I also added some pre-sautéed kale at the end for some extra veg (not authentic, but yum!) Plenty of ideas to work with using this recipe.

This was wonderful!  Very tasty and enjoyed by all four in our family: 2 adults, a 13 yr. old, and a 16 year old.  This will become a regular, go-to recipe in our house.

This is my ultimate go-to curry recipe. I first found it about 5 years ago and have tried others since then, but nothing comes close to this one. The only personal change I made to the recipe, do to a family member's allergies, is swapping the coconut milk for heavy cream. Still so amazing!

This is an excellent base and seems to be very forgiving of substitutions and additions. I've never made anything like this before and it was a hit even with changes. I toasted all of the spices in a dry pan (cayenne included) and a large pinch of cardamom. Set aside. Added a diced red bell pepper to the onions and 1/2 lb. of sliced mushrooms. I had to swap the yogurt for sour cream and skipped the lemon juice. It all worked out really well. Great recipe!

This recipe has become one of my favorites, and I make it often.  I have modified though, just a little.  I use regular vegetable oil and a whole can of coconut milk.  I also add diced potatoes (cook them a bit first though-) or sometimes peas and garbanzo beans.  Also, I top it with cilantro if I have it on hand.  This dish is soooo tasty and flavorful; I absolutely love it!!

This was my first time to try an Indian curry dish and this one is a keeper!  The recipe was simple, it smelled wonderful on a cold, blustery night, and my picky teenagers liked it.  Score!

This is my go-to recipe for curry. I do as Nadia suggests and heat the spices first. This does make it quite spicy so for those who are sensitive, leave out the chili. I also leave out the lemon for no particular reason other than I've just never added it. I follow the rest of the recipe as is and add cilantro and a bit of yogurt before serving. Absolutely delicious!

I used this recipe to make curry for the first time.  I followed it exactly in measurements but decided to listen to some of the other reviews. I've actually never made an Indian dish that didn't call for cooking the dry herbs and seasonings first before adding the other ingredients so I found that weird. So I did that and added some fresh Cilantro right before serving which really picked up the flavor nicely.  Before adding the cilantro it was kind of bland. The search continues.

I'll definitely be making this again. I may play with it just a little, but I'm a (very) novice cook, and this recipe was very easy to follow and incredibly delicious. 

I just moved to a small town with no Indian restaurants for miles and miles, and this recipe will save my tastebuds! :)

Delicious.  I followed the recipe almost exactly as described except left out the cayenne since I don't like too much heat.  it was so good.  Served it over rice and everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Very good curry recipe! I added a little modification. I added a half tablespoon more  of the tomato paste and added 1 more tablespoon of curry and added hot pepper flakes to spice it up a little more. Loved the outcome!

This had a very nice consistency and looked very appealing. The lemon was overpowering and could have used a lot less. Could have had more sauce. Probably could have added more yogurt and coconut milk.

This is a good base, but I listened to a lot of comments and followed their instructions. I left out the lemon, added cloves, and fried the spices before cooking them. I also cooked the chicken with coriander and salt. I used canola oil, and my special ingredient- cocoa powder! It's really good, but mine turned out rather spicy because of the cayenne powder I put in.

I find that this recipe is a great base it gives you a platform to build on where you can go so many directions. Following the recipe I found that adding a bit of honey and little less lemon gave it a really nice flavor profile the red bell pepper was just for color and texture, my children don't care for the heat yet so instead of adding 3 tablespoons of red curry powder I added 2 tablespoons of yellow curry powder and 1 tablespoon of red for that nice rich ruby red color but not as spicy. After that it was just minor adjustments to taste, I love this recipe good work!

I took out the tomato paste and I use vegetable oil instead of olive oil. I also fried all of the spices before adding the onion and garlic! Also, all of the curry I've ever had from my Indian friends had potatoes in it, so I added potatoes that I diced and slightly boiled. But overall it was amazing!

I am torn about this recipe, i thought it was ok, but my hubby who loves pretty much anything i make and likes spicy foods and curry in general didn't really like it (even though he tried to lie at first lol). I did add more curry than it called for after reading the reviews and also it was not an indian brand curry, so i think that may have had something to do with it. I mixed more coconut milk into the leftovers and it was better. So i think that even  though i like spicy stuff i would stick to the measurements in the recipe and try a better brand of curry, but i will still make it again. As a side note, the curry smell in the house didn't go away for like 4 days!

This my first attempt at a curry & I'm loving it! It was simple and easy and very tasty. Will take other reviewers advice to toast the spices first and like others I think chilly flakes would be a great addition next time. Love it, love it, love it!

This is absolutely worth making just for the SMELL, which rates a 9 1/2! It has the enchanting smell of a great Indian restaurant that will linger in your house and drive you nuts for days!

I have made it twice and my family loves it. Much better than some restaurants at which I tried a similar dish. Very complex spices, although Cayenne is a Western spice it really doesn't "hurt" the overall flavor of the dish.

I love this and the best part was I had all these ingredients laying around my kitchen, so no grocery trip required! I tweaked it a bit by adding about a tablespoon more of tomato paste, about 3tbsp of butter, and I used coconut-almond milk, which I added about 3/4cup more bc my curry was getting thick and I wanted it a little thinner. The changes were a success and everyone in my house thoroughly enjoyed it. They even asked for seconds, usually a sign of a very successful dish! Thanks for the new take on curry!

Delicious!  My first attempt at cooking Indian cuisine and I was not disappointed.  Great flavor, consistency, and scent.  Used a bit of home-grown thai chili powder instead of cayenne was my only deviation.  Paired with Indian-style basmati rice and naan was an excellent meal.

Made the recipe exactly as written and it was just OK. For some reason, it came out really grainy (maybe my spices were old) and it had a strong, bitter taste to it. I think the paprika is where the bitterness came from. Disappointed since it got such rave reviews.

This dish turned out very well and very authentic tasting. Salting to taste is very necessary at the end. Seemed like it was missing something.

I have made it a few times. I used the advice to skip lemon juice and cayenne pepper the second time I made it and double the curry powder and found this to be a great piece of advice! My 15-year old son loves it and keeps asking me to make it again and again!

This was fabulous!! I didn't change a thing other than adding some diced red and orange peppers and thin sliced zucchini. Served this over jasmine rice with an egg roll on the side :) Will make this one quite often- it was sooo good!

I have made this recipe twice and have to admit I was disappointed the first time, but hubby liked it so I made it again tonight and OMG! It was delicious. The difference is I had to order more curry powder to make the dish again and the fresh curry made a huge difference, HUGE!! What a lesson, always use fresh spices for the best results. Duh!  Thank you Amanda for this wonderful recipe.??

I am new to Indian food, but tried it for the first time at a restaurant and was hooked. I decided to look up the recipe online. I didn't have any yogurt on hand, but went ahead and made it anyway. Increased the coconut milk and it turned out GREAT. I will definitely make this again! I made it with Basmati Rice and garlic sauteed kidney beans. A hit.

I am someone who likes to read the reviews before trying a recipe because the image can be deceiving of course. I read both the really good and the really bad reviews. I decided to try the recipe as written before altering anything. In my honest opinion this recipe was terrible. The entire mixture (oil and spices) did not go well together and the tomato paste was VERY overpowering. I am disappointed in how this turned out. I wouldn't try this recipe unless you plan on making a whole lot of changes.

Loved this Recipe.  I heeded the comments of another reviewer and didn't add the lemon juice or cayenne.  The bay leaf was also omitted just because I was out of it. Will definitely make this again.

I liked this recipe. Like one review I read I infused the spices in the oil first. I added more chicken.This recipe add a small bite to it. Thought it was very nicely flavored, you could always add more curry powder depending on your tastes.

Sooo disappointed with this recipe. No flavor at all.
A big waste of ingredients. there was something below one star - that's what I would rate this.

This is the first recipe i tried whereby a combination of yogurt and coconut milk was used to make the gravy. I thought that this method was great and is definitely less fat than pure coconut milk yet still retain the creaminess from using coconut milk. Tasty but overall pretty ordinary. Good curry for rotation on your menu but not outstanding.

No matter what I tried, and I tried a lot, I couldn't bring the flavor up.  This is very bland even with extras on all of the spices.

This one was ok, edible. But I got no TC points* from the kids. The flavors were good (though a bit strong), but the texture did not seem right. I tried it a second time, adding more yogurt, but it still seems off. If made to guess, I'd say the 3 tablespoons of curry is too much; it makes the texture too gritty and dry for my taste. Will not be making it again.


*My kids give out "Top Chef" points to my wife and I, and the one with the most gets bragging rights.

We ate it. And it was better next day. But I will stick to the ancient betty crocker chicken curry recipe. It's easier to make, requires fewer ingredients, regular milk, no coconut, and it's way tastier and for some reason (you only need 1 1/2tsp curry powder and a bit of ginger) more flavorful than this one, everyone noticed the difference. Do not put more curry as some reviewers recommended (8tbsp???!), it will kill all other flavors, I put 2+ tsp of fresh grounded ginger, masala,  and I did not taste anything but curry and I only used recommended amount!

Good, simple recipe! My husband could smell the aromas as soon as he walked through the door. I did not add the lemon as i did not have any on hand, but i don't think it made a big difference. I think a few potatoes in it next time would be nice. Will make this again!

I absolutely LOVED this curry!! I have had Indian curry many times before, but this recipe surpasses all of them! I would recommend this to everyone I know...except my immediate family members. They don't share my passion for ethnic foods :(

This was really good. I had no garlic and sub 1 tsp granulated. Used 4 chicken breasts and 4T curry powder. Also used a large onion. This was my first adventure cooking Indian cuisine and it was wonderful. Can't wait to try it again!

This is really great, you can adjust it a lot to taste. I double the other spices and use more curry, cut out the coconut and add potatos and carrots, diced tomatos. 'Bits' If you have been cooking Indian for 14 years and you wouldn't eat more than 'one bite' perhaps tell us what you would do differently!!

Yum! Like another reviewer, I also added a teaspoon of garam masala. I also added a cup of peas. I think I might leave out the lemon juice next time, maybe...It was delicious as is, though.

Well, we were in a hurry to cook and had all of these ingredients on hand (except plain yogurt so I used vanilla). Typically, I read reviews prior to cooking a new recipe, and I wish I had done that this time. Now that I see what other reviewers said about the adjustments, I completely agree. That said, it was a quick and easy dish to make and we certainly enjoyed it (even had seconds)...but it definitely needs some adjusting (per other reviewers) and doesn't stand up to other authentic Indian dishes.

It was ok, but it didn't really taste like curry.  My kids wouldn't eat it and I won't make it again because me and my husband didn't really like it.  The flavors were just off.

this recipe started out as a stir fry and then we turned it into a curry.  onions, peppers, carrots,mushrooms fried in coconut oil, then added ginger and garlic.  Then added curry powder, garam masala, cinnamon, paprika, bay leaf.cayenne. (didn't measure spices)  then transfered into big pot,  added small can of tomato paste and can of coconut milk. fried chicken in same pan and then added to pot. Simmered for 25 mins and served with fresh cilantro and lime slices.  The lime and cilantro was amazing on this!

Great base recipe.

I doubled the recipe and made the following changes:
1. Did not double cayenne pepper or cinnamon.  In my opinion too much cinnamon in the recipe to begin with.
2. Did not add sugar.
3. Used greek honey yogurt.
4. I added two small potatoes, chopped up, and one cup boiling water.

Great recipe. I used chicken boneless thighs instead of breasts. Delicious and the whole family loved it. There is a bit of prep work but once that's done it's a very easy recipe to prepare. I added a bit more curry and my whole house smelled like curry. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this for dinner and the overall response was there was too much curry powder. It was okay, I've had better luck using other recipes. I will not be using this recipe again.

This dish was good!  I felt like the lemon was a bit too much so maybe 1/3 instead of 1/2, even after settling the lemon kind of threw off the whole dish in my opinion.

This was good!  I did make changes though.  I doubled the recipe so I added two whole cans of lite coconut milk, one whole vanilla yogurt, and a small can of tomato sauce instead of the paste.  Also I only used a dash of cinnamon because I was afraid it would over power the dish.  I added some potatoes, spinach, and carrots and left out the lemon juice, and cayenne.  This curry chicken turned out really well!

Just tried this, as per the instructions (well, that was my intention)  It was good, but if I make it again, I'll use less cinnamon and more curry - while it was cooking all I could smell was cinnamon, and with a nose full of that it's hard to taste much else.  I had to de-glaze the pan immediately after adding spices, medium on my stove was too hot, and the spices started to burn.  I just added a couple tbsp of the coconut milk, then let the spices cook with the onion for a couple minutes.  I did only use 1 chicken breast, as tonight it's just me eating, but left the sauce alone because I want sauce on every grain of rice and more to dip some naan into.  On the first bite I was a bit disappointed, but as I kept eating and the flavours built up in my mouth, it got better.

I had bought some Madras Curry Powder awhile ago, after seeing Gordon Ramsay asked for it in a recipe from his "Fast Food" cookbook.  So after having a busy day, I thought I'd try it in this recipe that my family found delicious.  Yes, it could have been hotter spice-wise, but being our kids can't take intense heat in food, this worked out well.  What is nice about this dish is that it has a great taste as it is, so if you want more heat, just add a stronger hot pepper and/or more curry powder.

I have never made curry before and I was surprised when the ingredients called for lemon and tomato paste, but this was really easy and tasty!  I added carrots and potatoes too!  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This was a great dish to cook, however i found it was nowheres near as hot as real indian food. The amount of cayenne pepper is not enough and ginger can be increase; to answer about the removal of the bayleaf... if you leave the leaf in and end up eating it , it becomes like a razor and can be harmful while eating... this is why you NEVER bust up a bayleaf to cook with.

I made this twice - phenomenal. It takes a while to used to the smell of curry. I a still a little squeamish when it comes to that. But, when  smell it, I know I am making correctly. Naan is necessary to really enjoy this dish. This is on my top killer recipe list. Chicken Makhani is the other.

I'm still figuring this recipe out. I tried dry-sauteing the dried powders, but that got a little crazy. Good flavor overall though!

OMG. I love this recipe. I did heat the spices before add the oil like some users suggest and it was sooo delicious. I was looking for a curry recipe that had flavor but not all the swetness. This was absolutle perfect. By the way, i hold the cayenne pepper because we don't like too much heat and it came out great. I will do it again and again. Thanks for sharing.

This is absolutely wonderful. When I make this it fills the entire house with the most amazing smell. My entire family loves this curry and it isn't difficult to make. My grandchildren especially love it and I always have to make a double batch.

Very tasty, bright, lively sauce! I highly recommend. A good recipe and while not authentic Indian its a very good masala-type sauce that works with Chicken or Turkey or Veal.  Did you know that Tikka Masala was invented by the British? Of course an Indian person would not like this (because its not really Indian). It's more American-style and Indian-inspired and very good!

A very basic, very mild curry.  This is really good, easy to cook, and my three picky kids who don't do "hot" lapped it up like dogs.  Tasted great served over steamed green beans if you're trying to cut out grains/carbs.

Tried this recipe exactly as written and found it sort of bland. I wanted it to taste as sweet as it smelled so I made it again the very next day and substituted half the coconut milk with coconut cream and it came out PERFECT!

Excellent!  My husband and father who both hate curry, loved it and my two boys 6 & 8 loved it.  I was lacking some ingredients so I had to make substitutions.  I used vegetable oil instead of olive (recipe needed extra oil).  I used red onion.  No bay leaf, no ginger, ketchup instead of tomato paste and crushed red pepper instead of cayenne.  I was very easy on the red pepper because the little ones were eating.  I added sweet red peppers in the last five mins and added a little bit of diced pineapple as a topper.  Served with Zateran's carribbean rice and a hawaiian sweet roll (great dipped in the curry sauce).  With all that said, I followed other instructions to the T and it was incredible!!  I was looking for something other than the same old thing, threw this mix together.  Maybe the mix sounds a bit strange, but it was excellent and seriously easy!  Thanks Amanda

This was a fantastic recipe.  Like others I did attempt to change it.  I added more tomato paste and omitted the coconut milk since I'm not a big fan of it.  I took some advice from others and added a little more curry powder and cayenne, but next time I make it I think I'll make it as posted.  DON"T FORGET THE COCONUT MILK!!  I think this will be absolutely delicious if I make it according to the way it's posted next time.  Great recipe!

This was delicious! I used Greek yogurt instead of regular plain yogurt, since that's all I had available, and I didn't have cayenne pepper and didn't add lemon juice or bay leaves, and it still turned out great!

I have tryed this recipe several times and it has not turned out very well with out majior changes. The first of which is lots more liquid, I added evaporated milk, additional olive oil (not virgin) and chicken stock. Second even though roasting the spices adds a great flavor, if you use a curry powder it already has many of the spices this recipe calls for, unbalancing the flavors and leaving a "herby" after taste. I suggest roasting only the curry when it is called for and adding the other spices in at the simmering stage to taste.

This is a delicious and very easy recipe to follow with simple indulging ingredients!  Next time I follow this recipe I will use a little less coconut milk and add an extra spoon of tomato paste!!!!!!! Serve over basmati rice or with naan!

Great recipe! I will start making this regularly. We had it with naan, and it was fantastic. It was a little too spicy for us (i.e., too much cayenne for our taste), but it was right on the money for typical Indian spice levels, as far as my palette can tell.

Great starter recipe for homemade curry chicken.  As I like my sauce a bit saltier I added one pkg of chicken bouillion.  I also added some vegatables such as 2 small chopped potatoes, broccoli, chopped carrot and celery, cauliflower and snow peas.  Fresh cracked pepper too.  Nice recipe.

Perfect dish, really delicious and easy to make.  Replaced lemon juice with rice vinegar, replaced yogurt with kefir (almost the same), and tomato paste with Heinz ketchup, coconut milk with cow milk, and everything came out perfect. I was very lax about the amounts of ingredients as well.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, and I thought that it was great! Both my boyfriend and I thought that the spice level was perfect, not too spicy, not too mild. The next time, I might add some extras to our tastes...but as a base this is perfect! Thanks!

My 12 year old daughter and I tried out this recipe. We both loved it. We followed the recipe exactly, had green beans and rice on the side. The sauce was quite good, and the chicken was tender. I would recommend trying this simple curry.

For how easy it was- I will say this is the best curry I have ever made. I just threw in some frozen "Tyson's grilled and ready" chicken. About half of the bag. Yum Yum Yummm!

I made a few changes - I used chicken thighs, a quarter cup of julienned sun-dried tomatos instead of the tomato paste, doubled the curry powder, and added a few drops of hot sauce.  Everything went into the slow cooker on HIGH for about four hours.  We ate this with brown rice and naan. This was GREAT - had lots of flavor - and made an even better leftover a couple of days later.  Will definitely make this again.

Was the first time I made any kind of Curry Chicken. Added more cayenne as I like my curry spicier but would definitely make again!  Oh ya, I also added fresh cooked garbonzo (chick peas) for added texture.

Was excited about this recipe due to all the good reviews, but it was very disappointing.  The taste was sour and bitter-- and i was straining to figure out a good fix to make it edible.  Will not make it again.

I agree the sauce is a thick grainy texture. It seems wrong for the amount of chicken. I will not make this again. Just worth it to go the Indian restaurant. This was nothing like it!

Nice and spicy. This was the first curry I made myself and it was easy as pie and just as delicious. I have a terrible time following recipes and this was quick and simple but tasted like you spent hours preparing. For those timid toward spice I would put half the cayenne pepper. I also think it might need another texture like fresh peppers or water chestnuts. Wonderful. It's definitely going to become a family standard at our house.

This is a great curry dish with a fierce afterbite! To change it up and smoothen the recipe, I would add some raisins or coconut to the mixture. I also recommend a glass of pinot grogio to the whole medley; it compliments the dish. Nonetheless, it was great and highly approved from a curry connoisseur!

Nice recipe. I did an extra first step, that is to marinate the chicken in curry powder, minced garlic, a pinch of salt and water for about 20 minutes.

This was tasty, but not exactly what I was going for.  There was nothing wrong with the recipe as far as I'm concerned. It's just not the Indian flavor I was hoping for.  I listened to the suggestions from other comments and added more curry, potatoes, yogurt, etc. But it just lacked whatever it is I'm looking for.  Thank you for posting!

I am really glad that i always read the reviews and make adjustments before making recipies it turned out nice but nothing special and that nice had to alot with taste testing and thinking this is bland. I don't eat meat so i substituted the chicken with prawn. This is the lowest rating i have given to date and i really didn't want to i will put a really lovely recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband rated it 8/10!  I added a can of stewed tomatoes, used grated lemon zest instead of juice, and cut in chunks  two small red bell peppers sauted with the onion.....really tasty.

I made this for company so made 12 servings and served it with Naan.  My only complaint was that it needed a lot more salt than what I had added.  Thankfully we could add that at the table.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was awesome!  My husband asked for curry tonight and I reviewed many recipes on this site before choosing this one. I followed the advice of another reviewer to dry roast the curry and other spices first and used the entire can of coconut milk.  I didn't use the cayenne pepper or yogurt because we didn't have any, so I used a little Thai seasoning because it was spicy.  I added potatoes, carrots, and celery, and added about 1/4 cup of water because I knew the potatoes would thicken the sauce even more.  Probably due to the vegs, I needed to add some salt. I served it w/ brown Jasmine rice. It was a great recipe and we enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  I think I need to tweak it a little more to make it 5 stars even though for many it will already be 5 stars.  I doubled the recipe except for the chicken and added potatoes and carrots.  I think I added too much lemon juice for me.  I didn't have a fresh lemon so I added 1/4 of bottled.  Next time I am going to double again the coconut milk back off the cayenne and lemon juice.  I'll get it right.  Basically I'm saying it was the cook and not the recipe...  Thanks for great start...

This was very good. My only complaint here was that the coconut milk made it very bland, so then i had to go back and add moer than twice the amount of spices specified. GREAT recipe, I'm just going to try half or a third of the coconut milk next time.

The first time I made this, I must have overheated it.  It became very thick and my husband and I could hardly eat it because this texture intensified the flavor so dramatically.  The second time, I was much more careful and (happily) the curry was saucier and wonderful!

I enjoyed this recipe and found it easy to make however it did seem to be lacking something.  Next time I make it I will add some more veg and a hot chilli.  It has potential but for me it needs a little tweeking.

i've tried this recipe 3 times.. and it never tastes good. idky, the sauce always comes out kind of grainy-like. and not the right taste. it just seems so dry? i've tried the reviewers advice and that just made it worse. maybe i'm just inept.

I followed the last user's advice to up the curry powder to 8 tbsp. This is just too much.  It gave the curry a grainy texture from the sheer amount of spice in it.  I wouldn't add more than four or five, max.

This, I loved.  I just made it last night, and it was simple and pleasant to make.   I didn't alter the recipe much, just put in some extra curry powder, and a bit of Turmeric.

I really liked this recipe--if only I had enough yogurt! I added sour cream to make up for it, and it turned out WONDERFULLY.  Thanks so much for posting this.  My husband asked if we had any left overs and he said "I want to eat the curry dish as soon as I get home!"  Thanks a bunch!

We had Indian food in a restaurant once in London and didn't like it very much.  I decided we should try one more time just to make sure.  I'm sure this excellent curry but I gave it three stars because we really didn't like it.  The flavors are just so strong for our liking.

Added 1 potato, chopped into small pieces. Used whole can of coconut milk. Use at least 3.5 tbsp Curry powder. I served the curry with a variation of Indian Rice (Pulao) - also on this site. Rice was made with 1 C. jasmine rice, 1/2 small onion chopped, 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder, cinnamon powder, ginger, and cumin.

This is a great recipe. Iv'e made it 5 or 6 times now. Tastes like you're at an Indian restaurant. I use a 6oz container of yogurt and a whole can of coconut milk because it's easier. I also add another tablespoon of curry powder or garam masala.

My husband actually made this for me.  We wanted to experiment with something Indian and this was exactly what we had in mind.  Wasn't too hard to make (especially for me) and it tasted great.  The leftovers are already history.

YUM. We gobbled this up last night - I doubled the chicken because we're big on the protein content, and there was quite a bit of sauce.

This is one deliciously addicting curry. I've made this twice; all six kids loved it (which is a HUGE deal for us!!). I omit the cayenne pepper (because I am a wimp) though it still has a nice kick at the end. Other alterations: I used light coconut milk; 2 tbsps of grape seed oil (lighter) instead of olive; and I add frozen peas and a can of low sodium chickpeas.

This recipe was easy and tasty.  I changed the recipe just a bit.  I only used 1.5 Tbsp Curry (it was all I had), vanilla yogurt instead of plain, and a little less pepper.  My 18month old licked her plate!  Thanks, we will be adding this to our recipe rotation.

Great curry!  I made it with gobi aloo (a potato and cauliflower dish,) but next time I'll serve it on rice to soak up the plentiful sauce.  Highly recommended!

Not the best curry ever.  It left a really gross taste in my mouth, but I have to say, it did taste good with a lot of plain rice and just a small amount of the sauce mixed in.  Neither my husband or I liked the curry, but my 1 year old loved it, so I guess that says something, lol.

this was good. i was nervous to add the lemon because the sauce was bitter but i did and it somehow helped round out the taste. DONT LEAVE IT OUT! there was a slight bitterness to mine. i am wondering if i would have used a higher quality curry powder that would have benn prevented. i added zucchini and a yellow squash. i will try it again with some potatoes and a tomato to make it more of a one pot meal.

This was not a terrible recipe, but it didn't seem like the Indian food I've had in restaurants. There was something off about the flavor and I followed the recipe exactly. It was good...just not what I expected.

I thought this was absolutely delicious. It was really easy to play around with this recipe. Like I added more garlic and curry to this recipe.  Previously, I had used to mixes but this recipe beats them 100x over. I will certainly be making this again and again.

I gave it 5 stars for adaptablity. I must admit I changed the recipe.  I didn't have coconut milk so I substituted Cr of Mush soup.  I ran out of Curry powder and therefore found I really enjoyed it with less(about 1 TBS).  I mixed lemon in a small portion and didn't like the flavor so I left it out all together.  I know I probably took all authenticity out of the dish, but it was delicious!  I will add veggies next time.

Fabulous curry recipe just as written. I cooked the onions, garlic, spices and tomato sauce with a little water the day before then stashed the reduced mixture in the fridge overnight. The next day, I tossed in the curry mixture, with the remaining ingredients and cooked as directed. My guests polished off the entire pot; I'll have to make it again so I can enjoy it as leftovers the next day.

I made this curry the other night and thought it tasted pretty good! I did leave out the lemon and cayenne pepper as some other members suggested, but I do think the next time I make it I will add that and see where that takes me and see how much it differs, if any, from making it without.
All in all the recipe is easy to make and tastes great, the whole family enjoyed it and asked that it put on the remake list!

This turned out quite poorly. The curry ended up very grainy and the cinnamon was overpowering. We'll try another recipe next time.

I thought this was so spicey I couldn't really taste the flavors, just the heat.  I've had milder curry dishes that I really enjoyed, this one was just a little too hot for me.

This was very good! I used only half of the amount of olive oil and substituted the other half with sesame hot chile oil for a little extra heat. This was a tad sweeter than I expected it to be, but I still got great feedback from my company :) Thanks for sharing!

Great home substitute for expensive restaraunt food.  I made enough sauce to freeze for an easy dinner another night.  We found it to be a bit sweet, so next time I'll tweak the sugar/coconut milk amounts.

Very good!  This was my first attempt at homemade curry chicken (not using a mix) and my fiance and I both really liked it, so it's a keeper.  I followed some of the suggestions I saw and upped the curry to 5 tablespoons and dry-roasted the spices first.   I used shallots instead of onions and also added carrots, red bell pepper and mushrooms.  Instead of cayenne at the end, I used Hot Shot which is a combo of red and black peppers.  Only used a dash of lemon juice and no sugar.  I served it on top of couscous and it was delicious!

I love curry chicken and this is my favorite recipe for it! I substite canned tomatoes for tomato paste and make my own curry powder because I like it really spicy. This recipe is excellent if you like a creamy curry rather than a tomato based curry.

I will make this again but it isn't quite "absolute favorite" material.  I personally thought it was "alright" but everybody else who ate it that night raved about it.  It tastes good but is fairly Americanized.

On phase 1 of South Beach and have been trying to keep dinner interesting so I don't feel deprived. I love Indian food but I've always heard about how incredibly fatening it is so haven't had it in way too long. The ingredients in this dish work on South Beach and I believe would work with many diets. Used less oil than called for and used lite no sugar coconut milk. Didn't have lemon or bay leaf but didn't feel like a thing was missing. Did add a dash of nutmeg - not sure if that added anything. Made it pretty spicy like we like it. Was incredibly easy and will definitely be doing again.

This turned out really well. I was somewhat concerned because of some reviews that described this dish as being bland. I did the dry-pot spice roasting suggestion, and if you try this be warned about the smoke and the strong odor. I used half of the cinnamon, half of the lemon, and more ginger and curry. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe. I cooked it for an hour which I think helped a lot. I made a double recipe for 5 people.

Very good. I successfully used tomato soup in place of the tomato paste.  I used fresh ginger, mushrooms, onion, and red pepper, as well as a whole can of coconut milk.

This recipe was great; it tasted very authentic.  I added a little bit more curry powder to the mix, but that was the only thing I changed.  Pour this over rice and have some Naan bread on the side. It's tasty!

It was a very good curry recipe, though there were some alterations that I had to make.  I did not use curry powder, instead I used yellow curry paste, double the garlic.  I added a nice sized potato, peeled and chunked into small chunks, I added 1/2 cup of white wine, and 3/4 cup of chicken broth to keep the sauce a bit liquidy.  I omitted the paprika and the recipe came out stunning, served over Basmati rice.

My first time making curry and it was amazing! Lots of ingredients but worth the work! Make lots so you can freeze some and heat it up another night.

This is an excellent curry dish. I had never made curry before, so I was afraid that it wouldn't turn out, but to my surprise it did!  It was very easy to make, I followed most of the instructions. I didn't have any plain yogurt, so I followed a reviewer suggestion and just used a whole can of coconut milk instead. It turned out fantastic.  I added more curry for more spice. I also added potatoes because I felt it would add a lot to the recipe. I cubed 2 medium white potatoes, covered and simmered the curry on medium-low heat for about 15 minutes until the potatoes were tender.  Make sure to stir every once in a while so that the chicken and potatoes don't get burnt.

So yummy!! I made this with chickpeas instead of the chicken.  Easy and delicious. Add more curry if you like it hot.

Very good.  Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars, cause it's ALMOST as good as the curry I had in Kenya, but it blows out of the water this curry I had in an "authentic" Indian restaurant in PA. Delish!!!

Although we absolutely love Indian food, we've never tried cooking Indian food before, so we followed this recipe to the letter with no deviation except for the fact that we used drumsticks instead of breasts. It was slightly spicy, but absolutely tasty!!!   We weren't sure what to expect after reading some of the reviews, but we were so surprised, and happy with the results! It's definitely a keeper. The best part is that it didn't require a special trip to the market for ingredients, and it was so quick & easy.  It's a perfect recipe to share with a teenager or someone curious about cooking; and highly recommended.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I just used the sauce and it was very good. I upped the coconut milk and yogurt ingredients with more curry powder and a total of 4 garlic cloves, and then used the sauce for a chickpea and sweet potato dish.

What can I say with all the reviews? But this was a great dish, albeit a few changes were made. I had 1 cup canned, diced tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce, and I used 2 cans coconut milk in place of the yogurt. It was really wonderful - I added some hot red chili to kick it up, but it was still good without it.

Was rather disappointed, actually. Flavor was bland in that it lacked richness and depth - just tasted like everything was coated in curry powder.

This is a pretty good recipe if you like curry, which we do. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The flavor was good, it had a little spice (we like our food hotter so I would have preferred a much spicier version). My only complaint is that the sauce is a little on the thin side. The flavor of this dish overall was pretty good. I will probably create a version of curry that combines a couple of different recipes, but this was not bad at all.

I think it is a pretty good base recipe, but next time I will play around with it some more. This time I only added more coconut milk. I found the curry made it spicy enough, but over powered any other flavors that were there. Also the sauce carried all the flavor and the meat was a bit bland on the inside. So next time I will try marinading the chicken in the lemon juice, salt and pepper. I might also add some cumin seeds and powder, and tumeric. For me there were just some flavors missing.

This is a very delicious recipe. Finally a good curry chicken. 6 Tbs curry, a whole can of the lite coconut milk (I like sauce). Less cinnamon the better. I will make sure not to portion on top of rice when I freeze as it kinda sucked when I reheated it. Instead keep 'em separte.

YUM! I only made a couple of changes because I didn't have some of the items on hand. Instead of coconut milk I used evaporated milk..and instead of plain yogurt I used sour cream. It still was great. The 1st curry recipe I've ever made but it turned out! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I gave this 4 stars because I don't think it's fair to mark it down because my husband apparently doesn't like curry and I don't like really spicy food. I just didn't realize how spicy it would be. It did have a really good flavor, so I would make it again with less curry except that I would be the only one eating it.

Wonderful!  I use less sugar and cinnamon and more curry.  I also add one can of chickpeas and cook my basmati rice with green peas and cumin seeds!  Making a corriander chutney (mix 1 tomato, 1 bunch corriander/cilantro, 1 clove garlic, and a lil yogurt/coconut in blender!) for garnish is easy and tastes delicious when mixed into individual servings of curry!  Deliciouso - restaurant quality at home!

This was really quite good.  I made it exactly as posted except I added 3 green cardamon pods and I whisked in a little corn starch at the end of the cooking time to thicken the sauce up. Great recipe, my husband and I ate every drop.

So yummy! This is now one of my favorite recipes. I play with it a bit... I like to add a small box of raisins while it simmers - we like that contrast of sweet and savory. I also leave out the cyanne pepper to keep it milder, and dry roast the spices before adding the oil, as suggested by others. I always add a whole can of lite coconut milk (the leftover can wouldn't keep, so I might as well, and it tastes great!), and once when I didn't have much yogurt, I substitued  some thickened cream instead. That was just as yummy. Sometimes I add a few veggies, and sometimes just keep it purely chicken. This is such a flavorful and flexible recipe! I have a lot of fun with it!

Not as flavorful as I would have hoped but I should have added more salt and I like it to be more spicy so in the end I added a bunch more cayenne. Not bad though...

My hubby and I made this tonight. It was pretty good. Very spicy, but we liked that. I think next I'll try to add some more garlic. Other than that, I thought it was good.

I love this recipe. It made a really great restraunt-style curry. I did make a couple changes, though. I added a whole chopped green pepper, a whole carrot and two celery sticks [chopped and boiled first.]  I left out the bay leaf because it was too expensive, and used a dash of oregano instead. I didn't have coconut milk so I used regular milk with a pinch of shredded coconut in it's place. I also added 1/4 cup of half and half to make it creamier. It came out delicious!  The leftovers taste great too. Taste it before you add the cayenne pepper!  I find it's usually spicy enough without it. Also don't forget to add a pinch of cumin when you cook the rice to get that Indian flavor. A great way to learn Indian cooking!

Yummy!  I live in China, and I had to omit the coconut milk (not available), but I used coconut yogurt instead, and made up the liquid volume with chicken broth.  It turned out really well, and was delicious served over rice!

Delicious and tangy- if you like it hot, add a bit more of the pepper. I served it to 11 college girls, and they all loved it!

Wow!! So GOOD!! I was looking for a good curry chicken recipe that was not only easy, but tasty. This definitly fit the bill. My house smelled so good that night! I made some Naan & Jasmine rice to go with it. It was like eating in an Indian restaurant without the belly dancers!

Very very very good!  I used sour cream instead of the yogurt and I usually end up using the whole can of coconut milk since it goes to waste otherwise.  I also use ground ginger since I never have fresh on hand.  Cooking the spices first in the pan as someone sugested really adds to the flavor.  I usually add potatoes, lots of peppers--red and green, and sometimes zuchinni just to add more vegetables.  I don't make it very hot so my kid will eat it, but it's still awesome. Your house will smell like curry for several days though!

I was so excited to try this recipe. I have never had curry before so I thought it best to try it at home before spending money at a restaurant. I consider myself a pretty good cook, I can replicate almost any recipe with great results. I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of frying the spices in the olive oil prior to adding the onion(as recommended in other indian recipes I've read) I couldnt wait to eat it, the aroma was heavenly. Really, it smelled mouth watering. The taste was disappointing. It definitely did not taste as well as it smelled. The heat/spicyness was great, the flavor was somewhat flat. It was kind of bitter/sour and I thought it needed something but I cant quite place it. I think it needs a bit of sweetness and some more garlic maybe. Perhaps next time I will add a bit more sugar, try vanilla yogurt instead of plain and add some more garlic & ginger.  I would love to try it again, but only after trying curry in a restaurant so I have something to compare it to.

This was very good, it was just missing a little something to bring out all the flavors. However the next day it was almost too hot to eat. I followed the recipe exactly.

I thought this recipe was just ok. I followed it exactly, tasted it and then added more spices. Considering all the good reviews I thought it was going to be great. The sauce was ok, but the chicken tasted bland even after I added a few more tablespoons of curry, extra pepper and ginger.  I had to add lots of cayenne and rice to enjoy it somewhat.  Perhaps I did something wrong?

I came across this recipe about a year ago and I've made it many, many times since then. I love it! I've received a lot of compliments for my cooking thanks to it.  I put 2 tbsp curry, not 3 and it tastes great.  I also try to cook the chicken no longer than 20-22 minutes altogether (before and after the lemon) to make sure it remains nice and juicy. Thanks for the recipe!

Smells wonderful and tastes good. Could use some more spices to be more authentic, and the sauce was a little runny. Will definitely try again and tweak some of the ingredients.

This recipe is most certainly one of my favorites.  I've made it several times, and it just keeps getting better.  One recommendation I would like to suggest would be to try substituting the chicken breast with boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  The dark meat is so much softer and the flavor seems to adhere to the meat a little better.  It adds that authentic indian restauraunt taste to the dish, in my personal opinion.  Nonetheless, this recipe is A+!

I followed this recipe  pretty closely but it turned out very sweet. The only changes I made was to omit the lemon (didn't have any) and added 1 cup of potatoes. Next time I will use less onions and omit the sugar. Otherwise, it was good with flat bread and jasmine rice.

WOW -- this was much easier than I expected (usually I shy away from so many ingredients, since I'm more a baker than a cook), and tasted great!  I ended up using what I had rather than sticking exactly to the recipe: half a red onion instead of the whole white onion; 1 heaping T of garlic chile sauce instead of tomato paste (plus 3 large t of cornstarch to thicken); soy milk instead of coconut milk; and an extra chicken breast.  I mostly tasted a really great heat, with the undercurrent of a really good "spice" -- for me, it hit the spot for curry that made the work very rewarding!

I am not an authority on Indian food so please condsider that when reading this: I made this dish this evening and it did make my house smell good. The sauce, however, was missing something. I followed the recipe, only substituting ground ginger for fresh. It was spicy, which was good. Maybe it will have more 'umph' tomorrow after it sits. I would enjoy trying more recipes of the Indian and Middle Eastern variety.

This is a delicious curry recipe!  To make it a little more healthy, I like to use light coconut milk and a bit less oil (it still tastes great).

This recipe made me feel like I was a professional chef. The flavors were great and everyone loved it, even my 3 year old. It wasn't hard at all and I am now a fan of Curry Chicken.

Fantastic.  As suggested in previous reviews, use a whole can of coconut milk and simmer for longer.  As well, use more spices - double up on the curry powder and add a teaspoon of garam masala.  It really is a fantastic flexible recipe that's easy to make.  I added diced new potatoes and frozen peas the last time.

This recipe was very tasty and easy to make! It turned out just like my favorite Indian restaurant. I used chicken thighs, so it was very tender.  It was very saucy, so I'm sure the chicken breast would have been just as tender.  I didn't add the hot seasoning, so it was mild and very fresh with the lemon juice at the end. I highly recommend this one!

This is good, but still, it seems like it's missing something, doesn't have that rich creamy tasty curry flavour to it. You definitely don't need to put in the lemon, it's already sour just the way it is, that is why I put in a little bit more sugar to balance it out. Also I put in kaffir lime leaves instead of the lemon and it made the dish smelled soooo good.

The family loved this recipe. I've tried making curries before from a book and failed dismally, so it was great to be able to make one from scratch and find everyone loved it. I must admit I found it a little strong but as the rest of the family adored it I reckon that was just me. Dead easy to make as well. Thank you.

As Brits living abroad, we are always on the lookout for a decent curry recipe!  My husband cooked this one at the weekend and it was a hit.  It reminded me of home!!

Easy to make, tasted fantastic, I used 3 chicken breasts, doubled the sauce recipe and added bamboo shoots, pea pods and tofu - excellent!

We enjoyed this curry, but just like all the recipes I have tried before it, it tasted a bit bland. I am still searching for the perfect curry recipe, although I would make this again with a few minor adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty decent curry. Next time I wouldn't put in quite as much yogurt. I didn't put all the lemon in, probably a mistake.

This tastes just like the curry chicken in an indian restaurant! Of course my husband says it's not hot enough but it was plenty spicy for me.

This recipe was delicious!  Like a previous cook, I substituted 3/4 cup tomato sauce for the paste, but I ended up having to thicken it with cornstarch, I'll definently stick to paste next time.  So tasty!  Only problem is my house smells like curry :-)

I thought this was a great recipie, similar to curry I've had in restaurants.  I only used what I had on hand, though, so I ommited the ginger root, the coconut milk, and the lemon juice and it was still great.

I really enjoyed this recipe...very nice flavor, virtually no aftertaste.  I like that this recipe contained no mushy ingredients, such as apples, as many curry chicken recipes do.  I prepared this with jasmine & saffron rice...the meal stood alone.
