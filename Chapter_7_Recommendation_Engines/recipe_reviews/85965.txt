Ours turned out great. We added some Monterey Jack cheese with the parmesan and we've used broccoli or asparagus instead of the red pepper on occasion.

This was okay, but I suggest making some modifications.  I only baked it for 25 minutes, and at 350.  I skipped the parsley and added lots of garlic.  It ends up a little dry still, but perhaps using more broth in the mixture could help.

I had typed in 4 ingredients to see what recipes would pop in and lo and behold this recipe came up.  At first I was a bit leary because it wasn't a full 4 stars, but I love cooking with Sherry so I decided to give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have Jarlsburg cheese, I had a bunch of other cheeses that I mixed for the topping, including, 4 cheese italian, a little mozzarella and a touch of sharp cheddar.  My husband and I both loved it.  Someone had said it was a little bland but they had skipped the Port wine, it totally changes the flavor if you skimp on the Sherry.   I will be making this again.  Next time for guests.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Awesome. I made a few substitutions, but the basic recipe is wonderful.

Not very flavorful.  I added quite a bit of garlic and pepper and still very bland and too dry.  We threw the majority of it out.  Will not make again.

Very easy and tasted great! I didn't have any Sherry so I used a dry white wine instead, and it was still yummy. I also used mozzerella instead of the Jarlsberg cheese because it's what I had on hand. Will try it with Jarlsberg next time to see if it made a difference. :)

I used milk instead of cream, broccolli instead of mushrooms. I added garlic, and garlic salt. I cut baking time to 25 min. It was delicious and low fat!

Jarlsberg is a great addition. It's like pouring foundue over pasta. I changed up the vegetables to what I had on hand. Added more cream because it seemed a little dry before going in the oven. Will make again.

This is a good recipe.  I had left over turkey so that is what I used.  I did not have Parmesan and Jarlsberg cheeses so I used Edam instead of Jarlsberg and mozzarella instead of Parmesan.  Those were the only substitutions.  It was good and comforting, my granddaughter added cayenne pepper because it was a little bland for her.  Probably would have been better with the Parmesan and Jarlsberg cheeses.  Very easy to make, and seemed pretty much fool proof.

This became an instant favorite for my family to continue enjoying turkey after Thanksgiving.  I have also made it many times with chicken.  It has a terrific rich flavor.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I don't know what happened with the other's, but mine was again "absolutely delicious".  I only had heavy cream so I halved it with milk, I substituted the jarlsberg cheese with mozzarella cheese, and the green onion with yellow onion. The only other thing that I did was up the seasonings to taste and added cayenne pepper for that Louisiana Cajun pop. Whooo weee now, taste so good I think that I'll have another plate. Excellent recipe...

This is absolutely scrumptious.  I've made it several times - the whole family loves it. I follow the recipe as written - don't change a thing.
