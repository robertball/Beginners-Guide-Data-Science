I took the liberty of making a few small adjustments to this recipe.  Before I began preparing the chiles, I browned about 0.7 lbs of ground beef.  Before I added the cheese (I used oaxaca instead of cotija, and it worked beautifully), I added a little of the beef to each chile.  I roughly chopped the onion instead of slicing it (just a preference), and it tasted nearly identical to the chiles I get in my favorite Mexican restaurant!  (Oh, just a warning...if you're not used to working with chiles, you may want to wear disposable gloves.  On the scale of hotness, poblanos aren't that bad, but can still cause some discomfort if you get a hot one and have sensitive skin and/or eyes.)  This recipe is a winner, and I'm sure I'll make it again (perhaps adding a little cilantro to the tomato/onion/sour cream/cumin mixture).  Yumm-oh!

Te saltiness of the cotija played really well with the cumin-onion-tomato topping (it's more like a topping than a sauce, but it's just enough). I had a little trouble wrapping the chiles around the cheese, so I used some toothpicks to close them up, and put them in the baking dish cheese-side-up, like boats. I'll definitely make these again.

Made this and it didn't make a sauce so I added canned red enchilada sauce. It was so yummy! Thanks for telling how to roast peppers too! Had no idea how easy it was.

I had to make amends when I realized I didn't have the cojita cheese I thought I did.  So I used the shredded 4-cheese Mexican mix you can get in any market.  This solved the issue of dealing with the wrapping of cheese (although did take away from the authenticity). I also added salt to the sauce.  I liked this! I only made 1 serving - to test it out - but I think I would make it for others the same way.

These had a very good flavor.  Loved the topping, they just werenâ€™t very filling.  Next time maybe will add some beef to make it more of a meal.

Wow that cheese makes all the difference. It's like a Mexican Romano.

Outstanding! This is a good variation on the classic. This recipe does not use eggs, but you wouldn't know it from how tasty it turns out. It is also a lot less work than traditional chiles rellenos. I like the idea of using the broiler to roast the skin on the peppers. This one is a keeper!

Fantastic...can't wait to make again when my mother visits us in June. The cojita is the perfect cheese for this rellenos. I did add a little more crushed tomatoes than the sauce called for as it seemed a little too onion heavy. It worked out very well!
