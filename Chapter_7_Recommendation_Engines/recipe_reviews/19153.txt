This is a simple, healthy way to make sweet potatoes. I ended up dumping a bunch of brown sugar on top at the end, but you could do it without that too. Next time I would melt the butter beforehand because messing around with the little bits of butter was a pain. Also, I almost forgot to stab the potato with a fork before microwaving it, so for my fellow beginners out there, don't forget that step! unless you want exploding potatoes.

I tried a variation on the preparation. I peeled the sweet potato with a potato peeler, then cut the raw potato into medallion slices, maybe 1/8" thick. I laid these out in a single layer in a glass microwave safe dish and cooked in the microwave for two to three minutes. I then transferred the slices to a cookie sheet lined with foil and sprayed lightly with olive oil. The butter and brown sugar I applied as directed above.

Yummy like candy!  I used I Can't Belive It's Not Butter spray (0 calories) and Splenda Brown Sugar.

We love this.  Add 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of cinnamon to the sugar and mix together.  I use Olivio buttery spray instead of butter which makes it easy and better on the waisteline.

Very easy to make and tastey!  Used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Boiled the potatoes instead of microwaving them.

Really good.  We aren't a big sugar family so I used a little sea salt and butter instead.  Came out great!

The recipe is easy to follow and taste good.  I required 3 tablespoons of butter in order to get enough coverage on the sweet potatoes.  Also, I only used 2 large potatoes.  Next time I will use less sugar.  I never add sugar to anything so this was a bit too sweet for my palette.

Our family LOVED this, but I think the butter should be more than 1/2 tsp....  I used more like 1/2 stick.

These were wonderful!! I needed something easy and this recipe was perfect.  I sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  I might try brown sugar next time but my husband just raved about these.  Thank you!

This is a great way to include sweet potatoes into week night meals. It was easy and fast. I put apples on the baking sheet too and my 3 year old son was very happy!

Thease are just like I used to make in the oven but thank goodness for the microwave.They are really good.  I have to scale down the recipe though, noone will eat sweet potatoes at my house.
