Why everybody using glutenous rice for sushi? They meant for different purpose, suchi as making Mirin or mochi (Japanese rice cake).
They contain large amount of starch so it makes sushi rice too sticky. 
Real sushi rice is made with Cal rose Japanese rice.

My roommate and I used this recipe as a base (and motivational factor in making sushi at all) for our own sushi.  Although we didn't have cucumber and avocado sushi, I am giving this recipe a 5 because we wouldn't have otherwise made it without this recipe inspiring confidence (this is a VERY easy dish).  We used things we had in the fridge to make our own "unique" sushi rolls.  They included (1) Pepperoni Pizza Sushi Roll: Use several pepperoni to make a line on the rice, add some mozzarella, a line of spagetti or tomato sauce (we used tomato basil sauce we had left over), sprinkle with crushed red pepper and garlic salt; (2) Roast Beef Sushi Roll:  a line of roast beef (we used sandwich meat) on the sushi roll, a line of cream cheese, and a line of red bell pepper;  (3) Turkey Sushi Roll: a line of sandwich turkey, line of avacado, line of wasabi sauce, line of cream cheese.  We also had several dipping sauces on hand, eg soy sauce, wasabi sauce, and spicy ranch (we couldn't find sushi mayo).  It was delicious, we are making more this week for a dinner party.  My boyfriend and his best friend stopped by during our meal and also LOVED the sushi!

I agree with sushiichii; one uses a good quality short grain rice--a Cal rose variety is often preferred (Nishiki brand in my neck of the woods) to make sushi, not glutinous rice which is for desserts, mochi cake, etc. 

 I guess no one fans the rice after adding the vinegar, to cool the rice quickly (it won't be mushy, either) and give it a nice sheen like my auntie Kimiko taught me over forty years ago. I haven't seen that instruction given in any of the recipes I've seen here. 

One might try different brands of rice vinegar; personally, I prefer a nice mild seasoned one. In a pinch, one can use white vinegar with sugar added--use far less than you would rice vinegar, add a little and sample the rice while cooling, adding more as necessary, flipping/folding delicately with your rice paddle. 

All in all, this is a decent and simple recipe.

What fun and how tasty.

We made this recipe with a party of 12 year olds.  I put out bowls of chopped veggies, panko bread crumbs, and imitation crab for the filling and toasted black and white sesame seeds for the outside.  They loved making their own rolls.  I used wax paper to roll them and it worked out great.

I have also made these for adult parties and gotten rave reviews.

Yum!  I was really in the mood for some rolls today and when considering the drive to Bennihana, I suddenly remembered I had some nori in my pantry.  I actually used the recipe for "Perfect Sushi Rice" because I had some issues in the past with the "sushi rice" I'd bought, but then went back to follow this one.  These rolls are incredible!  I'm going to add smoked salmon next time...these really satisfied my craving!!!

A great recipe!  I added crab sticks to a few, and also smoked salmon. The smoked salmon was a delicious addition!  Definitely need some dipping sauce such as soy sauce or wasabi to add flavor if just using cucumber and avocado.

The only reason I'm only giving it four stars is because this is labor intensive.  But the taste was EXCELLENT!  It was also just a fun experience to spend the time in the kitchen with a friend making something so new and different.  We felt like we were on an adventure.  Maybe I SHOULD give it five stars!

This is a good recipe for a basic sushi. Including avocado and cucumber as a starting point, we also added a thin slice of omlette, crab meat, and roasted bell peppers. In another roll, we put tuna, supremed oranges and blanched asparagus spears. In yet another roll, we put pickled beets and goat cheese. You can do just about anything with sushi.

This was my first time attempting sushi. This recipe was super simple and tastes just sushi I've had in resturants. I chose to add real crab meat. Tasted great!

If you have a couple hours on a Saturday morning, this is a great way to spend it. The recipe (and finding all the ingredients) took some time but it was definitely worth it, especially because it lasts a long time.

I tried this last night it was sooo good!  The avocado and cucumber went together perfectly.  I also added some tuna in one roll tasted really good too. Great thanks for sharing.

I agree with others here, I felt intimidated about making sushi until I saw this recipe and decided to go for it. It is super easy! I marinated my cucumber in soy sauce, rice vinegar, and fresh ginger. I also added tofu. And embarrassingly, cream cheese! Ok, I'm white, I like cream cheese in my sushi! :)

Being pregnant I have to be wary of eating fish with high methyl mercury content and cold cuts being contaminated with listeria.  I have not been able to eat my favorite spicy tuna sushi for 5 months despite craving for it.  I'm very happy that this dish hit the spot!  (Be forewarned that if you're used to eating spicy tuna, volcano rolls etc. that this recipe will probably taste a bit bland to you.)  It's a very basic recipe.  CHANGES: Made 2 cups of Cal Rose rice then mixed in 2 tablespoons of Nakano seasoned rice vinegar and 1 tsp of sesame oil.  Just add crab meat to the cucumber, avocado and you've got a California roll!  Other great ideas to add into the sushi is shrimp tempura and use eel sauce from this site (don't worry there's no eel in the sauce) or maybe even some salmon roe.

Good recipe. Added a bit of soy sauce and touch of sesame oil to the rice. I also went for a bigger sushi so in addition, added a bit of scrambled egg and carrot. It was great

Recipie is good, but, it's not as easy to make as it sounds. Will try again, as for the cost, it's much cheaper than eating out.

When I first tried this recipe and read the reviews, I thought the guy who put one star and complained about glutinous rice was just a troll, so I ignored him.    However, he's right-- Don't use sticky/glutinous rice.  It's not the same thing as sushi rice, and it makes the nori taste fishy, along with giving the whole roll a sickly squishy feel.  Instead, use normal asian short grain rice, or "sushi rice".  Otherwise, I found it nice, simple, and quite accessible.

I really did not care for the rice vinegar.  I actually made this recipe twice, the second time minus the rice vinegar.  I also added cooked shrimp to the sushi.  It was pretty good the second time around.

I made these, they were very easy.  Remember to tightly roll so the ingredients stay in the middle when you cut them.  I also made avacado, cucumber, and smoked salmon rolls as well as smoked salmon and cream cheese rolls.  Very good!

I had a desperate craving for maki, & this recipe is what I made.  Regardless of your comfort level trying homemade maki, this recipe hits the spot - fast, easy, versatile and delicious.  I made mine with rinsed Spanish med grain rice, carrot, steamed asparagus and fake crab.  This is maki for beginners so it's a simplified version.  Once you are comfortable with this one, learn the traditional way to make sushi rice for an even better maki roll. Thanks for the recipe!

Good... Our first try at sushi. We used a different rice recipe, but maybe should have just used this one.

A little less rice vinegar, and a little more water I needed for the sushi rice, but otherwise it was a BIG hit :)

YUMMY!!!!!! My sister and I made these with Perfect Sushi Rice from this site. We did 2 California Rolls...with the imatation crab, cucumber (we used an English cuke), avacado. We also did 2 rolls with fresh Yellowfin Tuna from the fish dept. of our food store. This tuna was so fresh and mild...tasted like butter. Excellent! The tuna rolls we also added the cukes and avacado. We found our Nori seaweed in the Asian section of our food store....no problem. Served with wasabi and low sodium soy. Also made Japanese Soup with Tofu and Mushooms from this site and Vegetarian Dumplings from Alton Brown on Food Network for a complete meal. Thanks!

My girlfriends and I had a shshi afternoon a few weeks back, and this was one of the kinds that we tryed. We experimented and used sushsi mayo on some, and left the others plain, just to see what kind we liked best. Both were very good. Oh ya, we added crab to these rolls too.

I made this sushi and it was fabulous! I didn't have sushi rice OR rice vinegar. Instead, I used regular white rice and white vinegar and the sushi rolls turned out just fine; I loved them. I will make these again! I'm a vegetarian, my parents aren't so I did add imitation crab to half of my sushi batch for my parents. I also noticed that I didn't have enough rice cooked for 4 sheets of nori to be filled and the last one wasn't fully stuffed like the others. Next time, I'll make more rice! Overall, I love this so so much!!

I tried this recipe, and have come to realize that sugar is an important ingredient in sushi-making.
