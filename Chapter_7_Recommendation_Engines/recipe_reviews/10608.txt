A beautiful dessert that people will think you slaved over (but you didn't). Rich and chocolate-y enough to satisfy even the most demanding chocolate lover.

This is a great recipe, except that the predominant taste is of bitter, not sweet, chocolate. Everyone enjoyed eating it, but they all mentioned that it might be better next time with a little more sugar:)

This was so good.  We practically ate the whole pan in one setting.

This recipe is amazing!  My discriminating husband absolutely loved it.  I did add about 1/4 cup of sugar to the chocolate and coffee portion of the mousse recipe, just to sweeten it up a bit, although it probably would not have been necessary.  Impressive and delicious!

This is a wonderful base recipe! I love how it uses the coffee to give the chocolate a fuller rich flavor. (I often do that is my chocolate dishes even if the recipe does not call for it! ) For those of you that prefer a sweeter mousse try using the chocolate cream pudding recipe from this site and whip it together with homemade whipped cream (add a little cooled coffee to the cream when you whip it for a richer flavor).

The brownies are exactly right for me as I am partial to very dark chocolate.  The only problem I had was with the cooking time.  Mine took a lot longer than the stated time-- 28 minutes!

I don't know what I did to this recipe but the chocolate seized up on me, the mousse was flat as a pancake, and I couldn't even finish it.

My granddaughters, 8 & 10, used this as their first complex recipe with multiple steps. It turned out to be delicious though the mousse could have been firmer. They were very happy to present this to their parents.

They are so wonderful. Not too sweet. The only thing I would change is double the recipe for the brownie base because it was too thin for my liking
