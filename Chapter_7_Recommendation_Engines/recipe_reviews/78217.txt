This recipe was great, I did alter it a little as well.  I simply sauteed the broccoli and shrimp in a little butter and garlic.  I then added a garlic and herb sauce and the noodles to the pan with the broccoli and shrimp and mixed the whole thing together and plated it. Lastly I added the shredded mozzarella cheese to the top and put it under the broiler for about 30-45 seconds until the cheese was melted.  I think with the addition of the garlic and herb sauce it added tons of flavor but did not make it too saucey.  It was great!!

I have to agree with several other reviewers - there is nothing wrong with this recipe, it's just pretty bland.  I added extra garlic, some cayenne, and Parmesan to spice it up, but it still needed something more.

I changed this a lot, but it was great! I doubled the broccoli and halfed the pasta (whole wheat). I steamed the broccoli in the microwave and cooked the noodles. When the noodles were draining, I used the same pot and used about 3/4 very low sodium chicken broth and garlic powder and dried basil (lots of both), then I threw in fresh shrimp and cooked that for a few minutes. Then I added the broccoli and noodles and put in a couple Tbsp. of Kroger's Lite Asian dressing. My daughter ate it warm and asked for seconds, and she doesn't even like shrimp. My husband and I ate it cold. It was great both ways. I know I changed this recipe up, but this way it was 5 stars for good, quick and easy!

A very simple, tasty dish.  I omitted the mozzarella on top at the end, and my family sprinkled parmesan cheese on their own instead.  Will definitely make this again!

As is I would rate it bland an okay I wouldn't make it again but I added parmesian, tons of garlic, tomato paste, wine, and basil and the kids gobbled it up haha. Guess it is a different recipe now but the kids liked it much better and so did I.

Easy recipe but not a lot of flavor.  I doubled the sauce recipe and it was still dry.

This was really good! I was looking for a shrimp and broccoli dish for a little while and I found the one! The only things I did differently were I added a little cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up and instead of mozzarella cheese, I used parmesan. I served this for Valentines day with fettucine, a caesar salad, garlic bread and a bottle of chardonnay. Easy too prepare but it looked so elegant. Thanks!

This was easy to make and my husband and daughter loved it! I might try steaming the shrimp separately so there isn't so much extra moisture in the sauce.

I made this dish with chard and over rice and it turned out great. Next time though, I'll cut the butter and garlic by half.

It was OK.  Didn't have much flavor.  Had to add more margarine and some garlic salt.

Very bland.  I think you need to double the sauce, as it is very bland and way to dry as the recipe stands.   Next time I would add some spices (basil, oregano, parsley) and much more garlic.
