This was surprisingly good. I substituted 2 tbsp peanut oil for the rendered duck fat and doubled the soy. It is very tasty and is a great use for leftover duck (or other poultry)

I didn't have "proper" BBQ pork, so I cooked up some pork with some hoisin and soy sauce. I didn't use very much of the pork, so overall it didn't affect it too much. I also added a carrot, shredded. But this recipe was a HUGE hit. My husband ate almost the entire thing! It was fantastic!

Did not think much of the recipe for fried rice so I used my own.   Important to cook the rice earlier in the day or even the day before.   If you cook it and try to fry it straight away it clumps and does not fry well.   Also use some Chinese five spices for a more authentic taste with frozen green peas.   Add a bit of  cilantro to the chopped scallions to finish it off.   I make this regularly and my family say it is better than the take away.   The soy sauce makes it NON GF so use the GF friendly type.   I prefer the regular soy but cannot eat it and the GF type works ok.

Had rotisseried duck leftover from my Christmas dinner, and thought this would be a great way to use it.  I wasn't disappointed!  Used duck only (no pork on hand), brown rice instead of white, and added sliced snow peas and napa cabbage.  So good, soy is just right for my taste but husband wanted more.  Will definitely make again, might add more vegetables for color and visual texture.  Makes me want to rotisserie a duck more often just to have leftovers!  Thanks for a great taste.
