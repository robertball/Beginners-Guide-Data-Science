I liked it a lot except it seems like it needs some seasonings to give it maybe a little more flavor. I made my own meatballs cause I thought plain hamburger balls would lack flavor. I think it would be interesting to maybe try a beef gravy in this recipe, perhaps with a packet of onion soup mix.

We all really liked this. The only things I did different were to season the beef with some salt, pepper and garlic powder and to make 12 meatballs instead of six since 4 people were eating it.

I have made this three times now, its very easy and delicious. Use beef broth in place of  the water and add a little burger season to the meat prior to making the meatballs.  I also pour the soup over the meatballs only, which gives the meat a great flavor.

I don't have a pressure cooker so a big pot worked just as well. And instead of waterni used beef broth. It was so yummy quick and simple. Perfect for the cold night..

What a great recipe.  So simple and delicious.  With the pressure cooker you can go from prep to table in under an hour.  Many of the major soup companies are making different types of soup starters that go well with this.  Just tried a chipotle and tomato soup that was great.

Great base recipe! However, it is rather bland so be mindful of that if you're new to this one. I threw in a few jalapenos to spice it up but you still definitely need to season this otherwise fun twist on beef stew! Looking forward to playing with this recipe!

Great base recipe! I added some mushrooms, just cause I love them, hamburger seasoning to the meatballs and some beef&onion soup mix to the broth for added flavor.

This was delicious. Easy and quick. Based on the other reviews, I did add a few seasonings to the meat. Would definitely make it again. Hubby loved it.

The only change I made was adding a pkg of dry onion soup mix with the hamburger meat.  Made twice in one week.  Hubby really loved it.

This was very easy and fast to make.  I would have liked more seasoning.  I did add an envelope of onion soup to the meatballs though, which made them tasty.

I thought this was good though I added a packet of Trader Joe's onion dip to the ground beef, and I just used their tomato soup without adding water. Thanks!
