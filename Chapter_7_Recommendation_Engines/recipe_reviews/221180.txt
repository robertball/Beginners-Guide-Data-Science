I liked this recipe but have a few comments on amounts listed. My store does not carry 13.25 ounce cans of pineapple chunks. I used the 20 ounce size but kept all the other sauce ingredients as written. It worked great for me. Using a smaller can of pineapple would result in less sauce since you are depending on the juice from the can so I would opt for the larger can. I would also make sure not to use an Italian frozen meatball. I don't think the flavors would meld with this at all. I used Aidells Chicken Meatballs in the Teriyaki & Pineapple flavor that I get at Costco which come in a 2.25 lb package. These were absolutely the perfect meatball for this recipe if you can find them. I also subbed an orange bell since it is what I had on hand. I think using different colors would make for a nice presentation. Very good! Oh, and make sure to use fresh lemon juice, even though it isn't called out. It's got to be fresh.

I use this same recipe(minus the lemon juice for my sweet and sour sauce, but pour it over meatballs that I make that have a small amt of ginger in them to give a unique taste. I have had the same results, in Dec when we are invited to many parties where we are to take dishes, my husband and I make hundreds of meatballs and freeze them. Then we just bake the amt we need, put them in the crock pot w/ the sauce and we're good to go. The crock pot is practically licked clean!!!Thanks for your eaiser version

SOOO good! I love that this recipes gets its "tang" from the pineapple and lemon rather than vinegar.  So easy too! Just what I was looking for! It would be good with chicken as well. I also used freeze dried green peppers from my home grocery store so I am ready to make this meal anytime with simple ingredients I always have!

Definitely delicious sauce and super easy. I followed another reviewer's advice (Valerie's kitchen) and used the aidell's frozen chicken teriyaki meatballs and was disappointed. they turned out quite spongy and processed tasting. Not the fault of the recipe author, though, so I still gave this 5 stars for the ease and taste factor. I would just make my own simple meatballs next time since the sauce adds so much flavor, so you don't need to add a lot to your homemade meatballs. DEFINITELY double the sauce and use two 20 oz casn of pineapple if you like a saucy dish. Other than that, follow all other portions exactly (doubling). I also followed another reviewer's tip and used pineapple in the syrup instead of the juice. Oh, and I skipped the pepper altogether since I made this for a potluck and some people have an aversion to peppers. Didn't make a difference in the flavor - still wonderful!

I used this recipe for a social potluck and card party for about 20 people. They raved about these meatballs and by the time it was over they were all gone! I've been requested to make them again and how simple! Thank You!!

This is excellent!! I use a 20oz can of pineapple chunks with about 1.75 lb of frozen gluten-free meatballs then add a bag of frozen stir-fry blend veggies. So delicious!! I have made this twice in the last month because my fiance and I both love it so much.

Very good flavor but toward the end I had to make another batch of the sauce and add that because it just needed more to coat the meatballs for more flavor.  Also, first batch I used pineapple in 100% juice and the 2nd batch with pineapple in heavy syrup and that tasted better. (Used 20 oz cans each time) Will make again.

What a simple, fun recipe!  Although not from scratch like I prefer, it was a great choice for a last-minute party dish.  I fixed it exactly as described and everyone loved it!  The next time I fixed it was for just the family at home, so I left out the peppers to suit our pallette and it was still wonderful!  Now I'm on a search for a meatball recipe to compliment this preparation method!  Thanks for sharing this delicious, simple recipe!

Quick to prepare and tasted great.  I was afraid it may be too sweet when I made the sauce but it was perfect.  I used the larger sized meatballs so the next day, I served it over rice and made it a meal... very good!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I think it needed spiced up some so the next time I make it I will be adding red pepper flakes for some heat.

I made this exactly as written, EXCEPT I made my own meatballs .  I put the meatballs in the slow cooker for about 2 hours before I added the sauce.  I even like these better than the ones my mom makes with grape jelly and chili sauce (please don't tell her) ;)  This is a tasty and wonderful sauce for meatballs.  I will be making these often!! Thanks for sharing!!

Great sauce - simple, delish, and made entirely with things already on hand! Made for a party and not only were they gone in no time, practically everyone asked for the recipe. Only change I made was in the amount of pineapple-used an entire 20oz can. In juice by the way, not syrup as others have suggested. With the sugar I figured it would be sweet enough - it was just right. Regarding the amount of sauce...I made these as an appetizer and was just looking for the meatballs to be glazed. For my purposes, the amount was perfect. However, if you're looking to serve the meatballs over rice and would like sauce to cover rice as well, you'll probably want to double the sauce ingredients.

I liked this.  My husband loved it!  He said the sauce was really "yummy" and "we need to make this again."

Per other recommenders, I doubled the sauce.

Made exactly as listed for a work potluck.  The meatballs were all consumed.  

I would recommend using high quality meatballs as cheap meatballs will still taste cheap no matter how good the sauce is.

I'm giving this two stars because it wasn't terrible.  But, to be honest, I was very disappointed. Maybe doubling the sauce would help, but I made no changes to this recipe and it turned out lackluster and bland.  We will eat it because I hate to throw food away, but I also hate to think of all the other things I could have used 3 lbs. of meatballs for.  Removing this one from my recipe box -- sorry.

I really like this recipe but of course I went to the store to get all the supplies and I forgot the soy sauce/lemon juice. So, I search my cabinet and I found honey bbq sauce used that instead and it was amazing!!!!:) This has become the weekly dinner dish.Oh yea I added onions too.

I made this for superbowl party, and everyone loved it! I did mix the pineapple ( 1/2 in heavy syrup, 1/2 in juice)and added more peppers.  The sauce alone is amazing and will use it for other dishes.

What a hit.  I used a whole Green pepper, two small cans of pineapple chunks and one small of crushed (opened by accident, lol).  Next time I plan to try fresh pineapple.

I mixed some frozen Italian style and traditional meatballs in the slow cooker, about 4lbs worth.  Note it takes a long time to cook from frozen, so allow an extra 30-60min if cooking them from frozen.

I made my meatballs for this recipe. It didn't take long and they were delicious. I used 2 pounds hamburger which I think was good because I loved it being a little saucey. This is a great recipe and I will make it again.

Great flavor but you should be careful not to overcook them (I found 1 hour was plenty).  The sauce needs to be doubled if you want any on the rice- otherwise, it just barely coats the meatballs.  That being said, I heard many times how much my family loved the taste.

Very good and very simple recipe.  Followed it nearly exactly (used 20oz pineapple)and the result was a nice sweet and sour taste with a nice tang that would be a hit at any dinner or party.  Would be good as either a meal or appetizer. thanks!

Growing up we had Hawaiian meatballs over rice.  The recipe did not lend itself to having that extra sauce to enjoy over rice.  So I added water and some beef bouillon, since I did not have extra pineapple juice.

This recipe is fantastic! I serve them over rice for a full meal, and it's become a stable in my family's weekly meal plans. The only thing I change is that I swap out the green bell pepper for an orange one, just because I don't like the taste of green peppers.

Everyone LOVED these meatballs. It was a nice change from the usual bbq meatballs.  The kids even loved them.

I left all ingredients the same.  I did use the whole can of pineapples though.  The slow cooker was empty needless to say.

Delicious recipe with 20 ounce can of pineapple chunks as suggested from a reviewer.  The first time I made this dish!  My daughter loved it and so did everyone else.   

Today, I made it the for the second time and added some black pepper  and a pinch of salt.  Next time, I may add some pepper flakes too. My family always loves a spicy kick.  

Not to be a meatball snob, but my preference is to make my own rather than buying prepackaged always.  I made my own meatballs using extra lean meat and veggies that were so finely diced through the processor.  I also added soy sauce, blackpepper, salt, and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to 3 lbs of meat.  I then formed and baked them in the oven.  The soy sauce in the meatball is a nice compliment to the pineapple sauce mixture.   

My husband is not into sweet flavored marinades with meat but he did really enjoy this dish.  Thank you to the person who submitted this lovely recipe.  I rate it 4.5 out of 5 stars!

Bon appetit!

Easy crock pot recipe.  Excellent flavor, and sauce was fine with the Italian meatballs.  Doubled the meatballs (from Costco).  Tripled the sauce.  For sauce, added 1/2 cup chopped red onion, used red bell peppers, and substituted a whole fresh pineapple, chopped, w/1 cup of water ... instead of canned.

I would've liked the meatballs to be less bready and more salty by incorporating soy sauce in them instead of a dash of worcestershire.  The texture of the meatballs was what I disliked the most.  I'd also like it if there was more sauce.

I have made this recipe for years. My step son used to hate cooked pineapple, that is until I made this! This is now one of his (and my husband's) most-requested recipes. I follow the recipe exactly as written & have never had a bad batch. Thank you so much for the recipe

I don't usually like to alter a recipe too much the first time I make it, much less rate it (It doesn't seem fair to rate the recipe after I've changed it a bunch), but this time I felt like I had to. 

My local store didn't carry 3 lb bags of meatballs, but only 2 lb. I read other reviews that said there wouldn't be enough sauce, but I figured having a smaller bag of meatballs  it'd be ok. It wasn't. I ended up doubling the sauce recipe. I was out of pineapple, so I drained a can of mandarin oranges and used that juice for the second batch of sauce. It was very, very tasty. Next time I'll start off with two cans of pineapple.

This was fantastic!  We used frozen pineapple of which I weighed out 20 oz and added 1/2 cup of water.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  We also used the Aidell's chicken meatballs from Costco.  For more color, I agree with another reviewer about using red and green bell peppers.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I thought this was quite good. I made two small changes one was to use pineapple tidbits in juice....wish I had taken note of the reviews and gotten it in heavy syrup though. I don't care for a big bite of pineapple so just preference on that but I believe the heavy syrup would have been better. Second was to add a handful of matchstick carrots to the sauce with the bell pepper.

With a couple of changes this was good.  Made more sauce since the can of pineapple was 20 oz.  Added some chunked onions along with the bell pepper and pineapple (and a couple tablespoons of maraschino cherries).  Made my own meatballs and browned them first.  These changes made it like sweet & sour dishes I've had in the past.

yummy and easy.  I didn't have time to let the meatballs cook in the sauce so I just threw together some homemade meatballs from my go to recipe and made the sauce to pour over them with rice.  It was a hit!  Even my 7 year old ate every bite!

This recipe was in a cookbook I received as a wedding gift almost 50 years ago.  I still make my own meatballs but the sauce is the same.  We like it made with both red and green peppers and the onions and pineapple chunks, not crushed.  It is easily doubled and served with rice.  Even the leftovers are great.

I made it, but I bought crushed pineapple instead of chunk, by accident. I think it was actually better that way.  I served it at a potluck picnic. Some people didn’t anticipate it being that sweet.

My company and I loved this dish!

I did make some adaptations to it due to the need for less sugar. Here is what I changed:
Fresh pineapple instead of canned
8.45 oz. of Trader Joe’s Pineapple Juice not from concentrate
( I will use only 3/4 of the can next time)
1/4 cup of pure maple syrup instead of the brown sugar
Added a can of water chestnuts for a crunchy element
Added 2 organic carrots cut diagonally for color and additional nutrition 
Used Adeil’s Chicken, Pineapple, teriyaki meatballs from Costco
Low sodium soy sauce
Some dry mustard because it was too sweet without it
Substituted tapioca for thickener since I didn’t have corn starch

I served this over Gluten Free Rice Angel Hair pasta drizzled with 2 Tablespoons of Lemon juice and a little avocado oil to keep it from sticking

One of my guests thanked me for changing the sauce from a red sauce to this delicious sauce. 
“ A refreshing change from traditional spaghetti sauce.”

Used Simek's meatballs which aren't my favorite.  May try Amy's chicken meatballs next time or make  some homemade meatballs.  I wasn't overly impressed but some of the partygoers were.  Was a nice mild appetizer with some of the other spicier fare that was served.

Very easy and rave reviews from the family. I picked this recipe to try because the sauce is close to my Betty Crocker cookbook recipe in ingredients. I used a 20 oz. can of tidbits in juice and the juice of a fresh lemon as the only changes in the sauce. I bought 2 bags of homestyle frozen meatballs and used my crock-pot setting between Low & High as there was no medium setting. Everyone loved them and I will use this recipe again.

This is a great recipe! I made this at the last minute with items from my pantry. I needed something to serve with a lot of leftover fried rice. This fit the bill nicely and was so easy to make! I used two 20 oz. cans of crushed pineapple (one in juice, the other in heavy syrup), used green, red, yellow and orange peppers, added some ginger purée and and increased the other measurements from 2 Tbsp. to 3 Tbsp. I did use Italian-style meatballs, since that is all I had and I did add more brown sugar. A longer cooking time overrode the "Italian" taste of the meatballs. Otherwise, I left the recipe "as is". This turned out perfectly!

I was rightfully skeptical from the start about this recipe when it called for 3lbs of frozen meatballs, but I love cooked pineapple so hoped for the best.  There was not enough flavor to balance the frozen meatball flavor.   I ate the pineapples and let my kids and husband eat the meatballs.  When I  try meatballs again, I will create my own recipe and incorporate  a pineapple & sweet pepper mixture into the ball itself.

We LOVE this recipe! I will often put in about 2-4 tbs of crushed red pepper and about 1/2 - 1 cup of orange juice along with 2-4 tbs of minced garlic

This was incredibly easy to make. I overlooked the fact that the meatballs needed to be thawed first. I threw the frozen meatballs in with the sauce and set the heat to High instead of low. They still managed to cook in 2 hours, but just barely. Next time I'll thaw them first. Everyone loved them and said they were way better than the typical grape jelly/barbecue meatballs we've done in the past.

I made this for a potluck dinner at work and everyone asked for the recipe! I used a 20oz pineapple can and it seemed to fix the "needs more glaze" comment I've seen in the reviews.

It's still cooking.  The sauce is tasty, and it's not spicy, but everything does not need to be.  If I need more sauce I will add the sugar and soy mixture to the slow cooker, a very easy fix.  Very yummy!

Taste was pretty good, but recipe didn't yield enough sauce. Many reviewers have said to double the sauce and I would recommend 3x. I used 2 pounds of meatballs and the recipe sauce didn't cover all meatballs. Family liked it, so I'll try again with more sauce next time.

I loved the flavor (I did add a little fresh ginger and garlic) but I would have liked more sauce to it. It was plenty thick but not enough to really go over the rice and flavor it. Next time I'll be doubling the sauce.

Great recipe! I added a tbsp or so of vinegar but it's great even without it! I like more sauce so I doubled the recipe for a dozen meatballs.

I added my own personal touches to this. I did not use frozen meatballs. Meatballs were baked in the oven and then placed in the slow cooker with the pineapple sauce for 4 hours..it was amazing....

Very very good flavor!  This is how sweet-and-sour should taste, in my opinion, vs the oversweet overprocessed red sauce so many try to pass off as sweet-and-sour.   Be sure not to buy the Italian-seasoned meatballs, as I think they wouldn't work well here.  I cut the green pepper in squares, like my old favorite Cantonese restaurant used to do.   Otherwise I made no changes.   I bet this would work well with chicken or pork also.  The next time I make this though, I will 1.5 or 2x the amount of sauce.  Very very good, thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  Agree with using 2 cans of pineapple chunks to have more sauce.  I also added ~1/3 cup of white vinegar and it was fantastic!  Without it, the sauce is too sweet and the vinegar made all the difference.

We thought these were just ok.  I did double the sauce and could have tripled it.  Used extra pineapple as it came in 20 oz cans.  used the pineapple in syrup as others suggested- also I have a similar recipe that calls for the syrup kind.  My mother-in-law makes similar meatballs and hers are wonderful but these were just average.  In fact, a week after I cooked these for New Years they remain in the fridge untouched- unusual in this house!
