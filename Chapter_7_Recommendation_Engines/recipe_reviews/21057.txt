I had a head of red cabbage to use up and wasn't interested in making a slaw, so this recipe fit the bill perfectly.  I made a couple changes, based on what I had.  I subbed frozen corn for the beans.  I added some chopped onions.  I used chix stock instead of water (to enhance the flavor).  The soup never thickened to a chowdery consistency, but maybe b/c I used skim milk.  The purple coloring was very odd, but the soup tasted very good.  Some additional garnishes I used were diced scallions and grated cheddar.  It was an easy recipe and I would make it again.

I used onion instead of celery, and it was quite good.  Next time I would omit the green beans and replace them with more potatoes.  I also added salt, pepper, and dill.  Thyme would probably work well instead of dill, or just use seasoned salt.

Well, perhaps you are supposed to use pre-shredded red cabbage, but I shredded my own. Is it supposed to be purple? Otherwise it tasted fine, but I would agree that it needed some seasonings like season salt or dill & oregano.

I loved making this purple soup! I mean, how fun is it to eat purple food?! It definitely needed some modifications, though. I started by cooking an onion is some of the bacon fat, then simmered the soup with 2 bay leaves, garlic salt and loads of black pepper. It tasted good, but still a little flat. I think next time I will start with stock instead of water.

This was good soup, chowdery and purple! I added onions and used peas instead of the green beans, and used oregano and some garlic powder, and it was flavorful. The cooked cabbage and bacon and onion makes it smell and taste a bit like a loaded hot dog! Different, but I don't think I'll make it again.

As is, decent base... but needs real seasoning help . Adding a spoonful or chicken base helped immensely. Added a few shakes of some italian seasoning and fresh cracked pepper and then it was  nice soup
