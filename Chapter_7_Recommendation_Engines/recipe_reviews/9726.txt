Very good recipe and a great way to get rid of extra buttermilk!  I wouldn't call these "coconut bars" though - to me, it was more of a spice cake. Mine baked in 30 minutes (even at 350 with an oven thermometer), so I'd recommend watching the baking time. I omitted the glaze and it was just fine. Thanks for the recipe!

These were wonderful and made EVEN BETTER with a layer of chocolate chips between the crust and the cake! I doubled the coconut and omitted the glaze also. Thanks!

These were awesome!  I will definitely make them again.  I made a few small changes - I reduced white sugar to 1 cup, omitted walnuts and used 3/4 cup coconut instead, and omitted glaze.  Unless you don't like coconut I can't imagine anyone not liking this recipe!

Great!  A previous reviewer was disappointed that there wasn't more of a coconut taste.  So I deleted the nuts and doubled the amount of coconut.  I toasted the coconut while I preheated the oven.  Mmm.

I really enjoyed this.  It's more of a coffee cake / crumb cake dessert rather than a bar.  I used a little more coconut and did add some Cream of Coconut to the egg mixture.  Good for brunch or an after school snack.  Hmmm..I think I'm gonna get me a tall glass of milk.  Thanks Vanessa.

these bars are great!!!  if coconut is your thing, then add some to the batter.  the bottom crust is super buttery good and can be used for may other layered bars.

Good recipe to bring for a crowd.  It has a good basic cake/bar flavor that will probably be liked by all.  Next time - I might add a drop of almond extract to the glaze before frosting.

This is a spice cake baked on a crust, basically, and I didn't think the two parts belonged together.  No one thought it was a cookie, they thought it was a cake.  It was disappointing.

Deelicious! This receipe is wonderful but just a little too sweet. I subtracted 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar and use 1 cup of coconut flakes instead. This recipe is another hit from all recipes and it is sure to stay.

This recipe was easy and fun to prepare.  It came out of the oven looking wonderful.  I was very disappointed in the taste.  You can taste neither the buttermilk nor the coconut. The primary flavor in cinnamon.  If I'm going to eat this many calories, I want it to have a terrific taste.

I had left-over buttermilk to use up, so I thought I'd try this recipe. I LOVE THESE BARS! Very easy to make, and the taste was great. Next time, though, I'll use more coconut in the crust. Other than that, a perfect rcipe.

This is like spice cake with a cookie crust.  A very good recipe made from ingredients usually on hand.  A great "anyday" treat.

I cut down on the sugar and used 1 cup of coconut b/c of previous reviews but I wasn't impressed with this.  The crust part was too hard and I didn't even press it in (due to another review). It's okay but I won't try this one again.

I agree that these really shouldn't be called "bars". It really is more of a cake on top of a crust. However, the taste was fantastic.  I served these for my family and everyone loved them.

I was very skeptical of this, even as I made it; I just needed to use up some buttermilk.  This is a fantastic recipe.  Makes a delicious bar (mine did turn out bar-like).  Had no walnuts so doubled coconut.  Might skip the glaze next time- on the sweet side, but also keeps it very moist.  These are disappearing very quickly from the kitchen.  Don't let plain looks or sound of it dissuade you- this is a keeper.

Very good -- sweet with a little bit of spice.  I omitted the glaze -- don't think it's needed.  I agree with previous reviewer who said it's really a cake on top of a crust.  Kind of an odd combination but . . . tastes wonderful!

This came out lovely. I read others’ reviews and reduced the granulated sugar to a cup and increased the coconut to a cup. I also added coconut extract to the glaze. Quick,Betsy and delicious!

The recipe is good as is!  In the second batch I skipped the nuts and used coconut (1cup).  I put a few chocolate chips on top of crust and 1/2 C coconut in the mix.  I put in 1 tsp coconut extract in the mix.  These are so yummy!!!  Don't get me wrong, the original recipe is also good!!

Very delicious! I will make it again! I was looking for a recipe to use my buttermilk in and found I had all the ingredients for this one. Easy to make too (which I’m grateful when I’m making dinner the same night)! It reminds me of a dessert bar but without the condensed milk. My husband really liked it as well:)

I took other bakers advice and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup of each white and brown. I also doubled the coconut and did not use any nuts. I thought the bars would be sweet enough so I just dusted the top with powdered sugar instead of using a glaze. I think the are very good with these modifications.

Excellent.  Different.  Moist cake on rich, buttery crust.  Followed other reviewers' suggestions to use more coconut in the crust (because I was specifically wanting something very coconutty) and less cinnamon than called for (because I did not want spice cake per se).  I used glaze with a bit of butter in it -- takes the recipe from snack cake to irresistible.

This was delicious. So simple to make. A good use for that leftover buttermilk. I made it for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. My only critique would be the name. To me it's a cake, with a crust, not a bar. Which makes no difference. A great recipe though!!

Recipe worked great.  Nice flavors and good textures.  Only flaw is that there is too much sugar.  It is overly sweet and you could definitely use less sugar overall.

We really liked these bars and thought they were best a day old or more. The only thing I did differently was add twice the coconut as it seemed a small amount for the size of pan. Upon eating my last piece I thought that they would make a good carrot cake type dessert by simply adding some shredded carrots to the final layer. I can't say that would improve the dessert but it would be adding to the nutritive value.

This was really good. It does not need any icing at all. I did add a little extra coconut but it would be yummy just as the recipe indicates as well.

Different but good.  I more than doubled the amount of coconut based on previous reviews....including additional coconut in the crust as well as adding coconut to the filling.  I also added a layer of chocolate chips based on suggestions.  The crust turned out perfect with a cinnamon-flavored filling.  Not what was expected but pleasantly surprised with the end result.  The only reason I made this was to use up some buttermilk.  I don't bake often so the chances aren't good I'll make it again, but I have no regrets about making it this one time.

I thought the crust was a bit hard/crunchy but the ladies in the club LOVED it!   I added a bit more coconut as I love coconut.

Update: to accommodate a friend that cannot  eat walnuts,  I made this with pecans.  It is so much better.  Now, I  only use pecans.

SOOO yummy! Shared these at work and 2 weeks later people are still talking about them! I left out the nuts and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour and did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown. Not overwhelmingly coconutty and very moist. More like a spice or carrot cake than a bar dessert. Glaze is super easy and will be a great recipe to have on hand. Highly recommend!

You can't taste the coconut at all. The most prominent flavor is the cinnamon. This is not a bad tasting bar, but with a name like "Buttermilk Coconut" I expected it to actually *taste* the coconut. Nope.

This was a great recipe. I was able to use some leftover buttermilk and coconut. I also used less sugar. I only used 1 Cup of white sugar and 1/2 Cup of Brown Sugar. I doubled the coconut because I didn't use the walnuts. Also, I think you could use less powdered sugar for the glaze. It was good, but would probably taste just as good with a little less. 

The next time I try it, I'm going to make it without the glaze and add the mini chocolate chips to the top (cake like) layer. 

Overall, YUM! Everyone that tried it, loved it.

Fantastic way to use extra buttermilk, which was exactly what I was looking to do. The only thing I had to run out and buy was coconut, and I subbed the walnuts for pecans, since that's what I had. Delicious! I took some of the other reviewers' advice and doubled the coconut and switched the sugar to 3/4c white sugar and 1c brown. I think I will reduce the sugar by another 1/4 cup next time as it was still a bit sweet, especially with the powdered sugar glaze. Also, the crust was just a touch too dry--probably due to the increased coconut--so maybe more butter on the next go round. And I'm definitely going to experiment with some sort of pineapple glaze next time...mmm.

A tasty way to use some extra buttermilk but my mouth was confused. I firmly pressed the crumb-cake portion into the pan which made for a very dense, hard cookie-like bottom while the top was a fluffy cake. Next time I'll not press the crumbs in as firm to try and achieve more of a crumb cake texture as some reviewers suggested.

This is more like a cake/cookie crust bar. It definitely has a great flavor though.  The crust seems very sweet so next time I think I'll use half Splenda and half sugar. I'll also add some chopped apple to the cake batter for some more texture. Pretty tasty overall.

These bars are absolutely delicious! One fun thing you can do with them is double the recipie for the crust and skip the top layer. Those are delicious by themselves!

I made these bars in a smaller pan since I don't have the required pan size, doubled the amount of coconut and used only 1 cup white sugar------Delicious! I served it warm with vanilla Haagen Daz ice cream and my husband (who is not an easy pleaser when it comes to baking), couldn't help but love it. Thanks.

My husband and I really liked these bars, although I substituted pecans for the walnuts. They were unlike anything I had before. Will definitely make again, although only one of my boys liked them enough to care.
