The pie was wonderful.  However, next time I make it, I will be sure to start the lemon mixture very slowly on low.  I must have started too high, because some of the egg whites cooked.  It wasn't noticeable and everyone raved about the pie.

AMAZING taste with this pie.  The Blizzard of 2011 hit today, so they only thing I could do was cook and bake.  What a fun day!!  This pie is loaded with flavor.  It has the tartness of the fresh lemon juice in the bottom layer and the sweetness of the blueberries on top.  I let the lemon layer set up on the crust, in the refrigerator for about an hour before I put on the blueberry layer.  The pie set up great, but I couldn't cut a beautiful piece without the blueberries sliding.  I will definitely be making this pie again, but I will increase the cornstarch to 2 tablespoons hoping the blueberries won't slide next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I am not a big baker and desserts are usually something that I avoid making, but this pie was delicious and VERY easy to make. My 18mo daughter and I couldn't get enough of it and we will definitely make it again!

Delicious.  The down side is the time needed to stay next to the pot while the filling is cooking.
The flavors work well together.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  Every time I make it, everyone loves it!  It's very easy and yields a great result.  I added a little more cornstarch/water mixture to thicken up the blueberries a bit, but that's the only change.  Thank you!

I was excited to try this recipe because I thought the flavor combination sounded good.  However, I was disappointed with the end result - don't know if it was the variety of textures or flavors.  Very few of the people who tried the pie liked it, so I would not make it again.

I'm giving this recipe a 4-star review only because of the lemon curd that goes on the bottom.  I wondered about using the whole egg, and now I know why I can't.  I made the curd on a very low heat and stirred it constantly from beginning to end.  It did cook the whites!  I had to strain that part before I could add the lemon to the pie, and so I lost a lot of the zest, which I tried to save as best I could.  I'll try this just using the egg yolks next time.  Even then this pie was absolutely delicious.  The blueberries were perfect on top of the lemon!  The pie crust I used was this one, which was PERFECT!
