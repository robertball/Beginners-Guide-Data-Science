This was really quite good.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  It wasn't over the top, but it has the potential to be so.  It's not difficult at all.  Just a couple of minutes more than making a simple cheese sauce would have taken.  I had frozen cauliflower that I was looking for a new way to prepare, and although fresh would probably have been tastier, frozen worked just fine.  I just let it thaw and drain in a colander and skipped the blanching process.  I did soften some minced shallots in the butter before adding the flour, used garlic seasoned bread crumbs, threw in a slice of pepper jack cheese along with the cheddar, and topped with cheddar flavored french fried onions.  I wouldn't mess with the original recipe too much, but the next time (and I will make this again---even hubby liked it) I plan to add a little bacon.  Probably some store-bought bacon bits in a jar.  After all, I don't know anything that isn't better with bacon.

This was really good. Used half broccoli, half cauliflower. Added an extra 1/4C cheese. Also added one chopped shallot, which really made a good flavor difference. Next time I think I may add either diced ham or bacon, as the flavors would really compliment it. Thanks!

This was delicious! I thought it had a great taste. Not too bland at all. I did add a little garlic salt, but other than that I felt the recipe was great the way it was.

I have been making this recipe for years and my family likes it alot. Its not an over flavored dish. But if you enjoy califlower, you should enjoy this dish. I usually serve it when we have guests and usually with steaks.

Well, it's not something to just whip up when you're in a hurry...but it sure is worth the effort when you have the time! I've made this twice, now - once as written and once with half cauliflower and half broccoli. Both were great, but I think I liked the half-and-half even better. I served it with lamb-stuffed bell peppers last night (cooked them at the same time at 375 degrees, adding 5 minutes to the recipe time) and received raves!

I've made this twice in one week now, so you can probably tell I liked this! I didn't find it took long to make; my tip -use a processor to grate the cheese or buy ready grated to save time, and an electric whisk for the egg whites. The only changes I made were to add a pinch of mustard powder and garlic powder to the sauce, that's all. I've made cauliflower cheese MANY times before and I liked the texture of this one a lot more than any others. I have young kids and they all finished their's without a fuss.

We really enjoyed this dish. My son ate almost the entire pan by himself. I didn't have cheddar in the house, so I used pepper jack instead. I'm planning to double the recipe and make a larger batch to take to a post-Thanksgiving family gathering.

I would give it less than a one if it was an option.  There was no flavor at all.  My family did not like this recipe and we did not finish it.  Fluffing the eggs made it taste like a cauliflower quiche with no flavor.

This is a great starter recipe! Because it has cheese in it you have to add A LOT more seasonings to it, the cheese mask a lot of flavors so go wild! I usually add about 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of pepper and some kind of other flavorful pepper like 1 or 2 jalapeno peppers based on their size or 1/2 tsp cajuin pepper. I do usually add 1 cup more cheese for a bigger cheese punch too. Good luck!

This was a good side dish...nothing to be excited about and it tasted a bit more like a breakfast dish then a dinner side--- very eggy but I guess one could assume that by looking at the ingredients.

No one else in my home will eat cauliflower, so when my dad sent me a large head of romanesco cauliflower (google it for some wild pictures of it), I decided to transform it into a casserole that would keep for a couple days. The romanesco is an unusually spicy cauliflower which I am sure enhanced the overall outcome. Still, this is a good recipe. In an effort to make it less quiche-y (as some people commented), I used only 2 eggs instead of the 3 called for in the recipe. I sauteed one medium onion and added a couple teaspoons of minced garlic at the end of the saute. I believe it turned out perfect. I added a little grated cheese on top during the last 5 minutes & it was gorgeous to look at.

It was ok... after a few bites I acquired the little bit of flavor that was there. Some suggestions I have would be to not put the breadcrumbs on top because they burned a little bit and all the flavor was in the breadcrumbs. Also, I think if make it again, I won't use the whipped egg around it, and i would just leave the cauliflower cheese part as a casserole and bake that for 30 minutes instead. If you put some spices in it, perhaps some italian seasoning or garlic or something, it would be quite good. The cheesy cauliflower part just needed something extra.

This was just OK.  It seemed more like an egg bake than cauliflower.  If I wanted this again I'd probably only use 2 eggs.

This was ok as written but not great. I tasted it along the way after the cheese sauce was added and before the egg. It was really good. Something happened when I put the egg whites in and baked it. While it puffed, it had more of a cauliflower souffle taste. I'm not the best cheese sauce maker, but will use the cheese sauce from now on. Just No Egg.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and our children absolutely love it. This is one dish that never has any leftovers. The only change I make is to add garlic to suit our tastes as we are garlic lovers. Delicious!!

Three stars because it needs more ingredients.   I had a large cauliflower so I doubled all the ingredients.  Also I used a 3 quart glass baking dish  9.5  x 13.5.  + Lots of additions - 6 sliced green onions (1 for topping), 1 large garlic clove,  1 chopped jalapeno, 1 Tablespoon of Italian herb blend, 1/2 tsp of seasoning salt, 1/2 tsp of onion powder,  3 Tablespoons of parmesan (1 for topping), an additional cup of shredded cheddar for a total of three cups.  Cooking time was 40 - 45 minutes.  The topping I made  was 1 cup crushed  croutons mixed with 1 Tablespoon parmesan and half a cup of cheddar and  a sliced green onion.  Put the topping on after you turn off the oven and put dish back in until topping is toasty.  My version 4 stars.  It made a good lunch.

This recipe was a hit for the whole family!  I had some frozen cauliflower I was determined to use. (12 oz bag workd fine... probably could have used a bit more though.)  The recipe is easy.  I guess I did not whip the egg whites well, or I over mixed them into the cauliflower mix, because as you can see, mine did not puff. :(  The reviews at the dinner table were fabulous - kids said it tasted like mac and cheese and the hubby said, "I cant believe I like cauliflower."  It was really good, you cant taste the cauliflower at all. (that is why I am wondering if some more would have been better.)  Anyway, definitely keeping a hold of this recipe!  IT'S GREAT!

Loved it!!! Easy to make it and for the first time ever cauliflower doesn't bother my stomach. Very refined flavor , sweetness of cauliflower balances perfectly with the Parmesan .

Simple and delicious!  Sort of like a low carb macaroni and cheese.  I added a little less cauliflower to make sure there was a higher cheese sauce ratio :)  Will definitely make again!

Followed the directions exactly.  We all thought it was on the bland side.  Maybe some onion, ham or extra cheese would help.   Thanks for sharing a new recipe for us to try, STUCKINLAMADD.

This was flavorfull and fluffy. We enjoyed it and will make it again. I put shredded cheese and Panko bread crumbs on top to make a tastier and crispier top crust.

I thought this was great and so did everyone else!  folding in the egg whites really did make it sorta "fluffy" -- only one advice, make sure you gt the cauliflower florets into fairly small pieces.  I'll def be making this again :)

We liked this dish. Cauliflower is the star of this dish. With that being said, cauliflower is a bland vegetable. I think I will add chives next time just to add a little color and subtle flavor. I agree with other reviewers who found this recipe needs more flavor. But, if cauliflower is to be the main focus only then the dish is a success.

The egg makes this taste more "brunch" than side dish. I did make changes similar to other reviews. my additions included - 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup pepperjack. onions. groud ham.  oh and i did use frozen cauli - not my choice. IF I make again I will decrease or eliminate the egg so it tastes like a veggie! oh and fresh cauli, because I will run to the store next time. haha

I made this just as the recipe stated.  My husband and I loved it.  We both really like cauliflower!  This is the best we have had.  We had leftovers and re-heated the next day and it was even better the 2nd day. 

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I am giving this only three stars, BUT I think next time it will be 5 strong stars.  The flavor was fantastic, really worked well together.  I took the advise of the other reviewers and added sauteed onions.  I somehow skipped the part that says cook cauliflower first (I kept thinking, gosh that's wierd!)  It turned out raw (eek!)  I will definately make this again...correctly! Maybe with broccoli...?

I added onion and garlic powders and I still found it to be a bit underwhelming considering the steps that went into it. My gang did not comment either way, which told me how they felt. Not a bad dish by any stretch of the imagination, however, I didn't feel it was worth the effort. The recipe certainly has good bones, but I wish I could think of something that would make this dish sing; possibly a pepper jack cheese? I'll give this another shot but with some modifications. Thanks for a good start!

I finally made this and am disappointed. Maybe I did something wrong but this tastes like a breakfast casserole.  This was a lot of prep and it just tastes like cauliflower eggs.

I didn't really make this recipe so much as adapt it.  I trimmed the cheese and butter, and instead of step 4, I baked it without the egg whites for 10 minutes then poured the leftover egg and breadcrumbs on top (along with some oregano) to form a sort of crust.  Note that I also included a thin layer of water at the bottom when I started, which may be what prevented the dryness that others have described.  It was a really tasty use of a main ingredient that neither I nor my family especially likes, aided of course by the relatively naughty contents.

I made a few tweaks  to the recipe. I substituted large crumbles of thin crisp whole wheat crackers for the bread crumbs. I also  used half  milk and half butter milk. I didn't whip egg whites but  used the 3 entire eggs in the cheese and milk mixture. I added a teaspoon of chili powder and Emeril's Essence to provide more flavor. I will cook this again.

Although I added other ingredients to this recipe, it was still too bland for my husband and me.  I added paprika, onion, garlic, dry mustard and parsley but evidently, not in sufficient amounts to give this much flavor.  We didn't like it enough to even try making it again.

I added garlic powder and it still needed flavor. I liked the look, the texture, and that it was based on cauliflower. Next time, I will use extra sharp cheddar, more pepper and some dry mustard.

Not a big fan of cauliflower but this recipe made it quite tasty. I definitely didn't shy away from adding my own spices (e.g. garlic salt, onion powder, cumin & chili) as well as some sauteed shallots and garlic which (I find) made it more flavourful.

Wonderful. It seriously could be the whole meal. I agree with the other reviewers: break the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Only used 1/2 cup of milk.

Made 18/05/2011- Good, like souffle with cauliflower inside. But upon reheating- I realized i missed the drippy creaminess of regular Cauli-chz!

Thanks for this recipe. I tried it twice once adding broccoli as well, was tasty but cauliflower was still a little hard. Tried it a second time on Sunday for friends, but this time I grated the cauliflower and used wheat germ in place of the bread crumbs (as suggested in the curry recipe) and baked it with some cheese on top. My friends loved it.

I used 16 oz frozen cauliflower and it turned out fine.  This is probably the best cauliflower/broccoli recipe I have ever found.  I made it exactly as written, except for the fact that I used frozen instead of fresh cauliflower, and it tasted great.

This is the best way I have ever had cauliflower!  Let's face it, it's a bland veggie.  I did add some minced onion (good decision) and would have preferred the pepper jack cheese (as suggested by others) but I was out of it.  Not a 5 star rating for me only because I don't HAVE to HAVE this again.  I will use this recipe when I prepare cauliflower.  I might just add some sundried tomatoes next time.
