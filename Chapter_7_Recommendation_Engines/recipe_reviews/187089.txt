I made this as a quick Sunday afternoon treat/snack for my three boys. I agree with Christina that this needs more of an "umph". I used reduced fat cream cheese, used turkey pepperoni and I added 1 batch of my homemade pizza seasoning and I sprinkled the top with parmesan cheese. I also used one whole red pepper (noone in our house likes green peppers) that I chopped fine. They ate it lickety-split with bagel chips. If I were to make this again, I'd add chopped olives. It really does need the spices. I think it would have just tasted like hot cream cheese if I hadn't. Oh, and I'd double it. My boys ate this in literally twenty seconds. ;)

This was interesting.  I didn't really feel that the mozzarella cheese melted.  I didn't like the texture of it.  I doubled the pepperoni and added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  The guys liked it, but it wasn't creamy like I hoped it would be.

We liked this, but I do agree, it could use a little more in the flavor department. I did also added a few chopped green onions and a little garlic powder, but I think it would be even better with maybe some oregano, a little pizza sauce or more toppings. Oh, I also added some parmesan cheese and that was nice too. All in all, it was good and the little guy loved it, so I will make it again (and play around with the ingredients a bit more)! Thanks for sharing. :)

Not a bad recipe. The smell reminds me so much of a pizza. But the taste (although it IS good), I feel like something is missing. Maybe some sort of pizza sauce. I'll definately make this one again, and see what else I can come up with.

I really liked the cream cheese and shredded cheese mixed together! I used an Italian 5 cheese blend and only used half the 8 oz bag. I added some chopped red onion with the green pepper. This was good and simple without a lot of ingredients and thought!
