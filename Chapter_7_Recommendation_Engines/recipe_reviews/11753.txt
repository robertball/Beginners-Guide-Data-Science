This recipe is so quick and easy, but that does not prevent this from being a very very tasty dish.  I make only a few, inexpensive modifications that result in an improved final product.  
1.  Instead of Starkist or Chicken of the Sea tuna, splurge on any brand of Tonno tuna.  Tonno is yellowfin tuna canned in olive oil, and it is found in the same aisle as regular tuna.  Yes, it is more expensive, but it is usually only about $1.50- $1.80 a can and the taste is WELL worth the extra money.  After you eat tonno, you will never ever want to eat any other canned tuna.  For best results, don't drain the oil off when you open the can; instead, flake the tuna and the oil together in a bowl before adding to the pasta.  
2. Toast the pine nuts for about 4 minutes, and add them just before serving.  Toasting really enhances the flavor of the nuts.
3.  If you can, use fresh lemon juice and not the bottled juice.  I am a huge fan of going the easy route, but not here.  Bottled lemon juice really does not work so well with this recipe.  If I don't have fresh lemons but do have bottled juice, I just leave the bottled juice out.  That's how much I don't like it in this recipe.  But the fresh lemon juice is really a great addition. 
4. If you like salt a lot, add capers.  Use wild capers, if you can find them.  They are found in the same aisle as regular capers, and they cost about $1.50 more per jar, but they sure do have an amazing flavor that is perfect here.

This is delicious and a very adaptable recipe that can be changed up to suit your taste. I liked it cold and of course changed it up to what I liked more of which was the olives and I did add capers. I did use the feta cheese and tossed it with red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice and used an Italian blend of herbs instead of just basil because that is what I had. If you make this recipe as is or change it up according to your taste you can't go wrong. It's a great pasta salad.

I loved this!  It is so fresh and easy and perfect for lunch.  I used fusilli pasta (1/2 the amount stated) and regular black olives (I find kalamatas too salty for my taste).  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  I rinsed the pasta in cold water when it was done cooking and served the dish cold.  I think the flavors of all the ingredients are wonderful together.  Be sure to toast the pine nuts!

This is exactly what I was looking for. It was quick and easy. I am amazed how great it tastes. I used plain macaroni since thats all I had. I did add extra nuts afterwards since I felt they complimented well. I don't see how theres much more to alter.  And its great hot or cold. Very versatile,  can be served as a nice dinner entrée with a glass of wine, to potluck to a brown bag lunch!

This was delicious. I used whole wheat pasta and half olive oil half margarine to make it a little healthier. I also used parmesan instead of feta and added salt and pepper at the table. I didn't care for the kalamata olives in this, so next time I will leave them out. I doubled the amount of garlic and still couldn't taste it, so next time I will quadruple it.

This was certainly different!  I used black olives instead of kalamata olives because we're not big fans of the kalamatas.  I also used a little more feta cheese than what the recipe called for since we are cheese lovers!  :)  All in all the dish was good.....next time I think I'll add a little more lemon juice for taste and possibly some more garlic.  We served it hot but ate the leftovers cold.....I think I like eating it cold better especially since the flavors had a chance to meld together over night.  Great summer pasta dish!

This recipe is amazing!  I served it warm, and did double the feta and olives, and used less pasta (about 3/4 lb).  I understand it was even better cold the next day.

This was great!  You can also use shrimp that is quickly sauted in some oil and garlic instead of the tuna.

I added a little more olive oil than called for... turned out great.  Served cold, by the way.  Everyone loved it and I will make it again.

We enjoyed this a lot.  Easy to throw together; this is nice when you don't feel like having your standard tomato sauce over pasta.

Quick, easy, and nutritious.  I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, but I am glad I did.  I made a few changes, though: I used farfalle pasta instead and I didn't have pine nuts, so I used sunflower seeds.  Also, I used dried parsley and basil and added dried dill weed.  At the last minute, I wished it had a little more nutrition, so I drained and rinsed a can of great northern beans and mixed it into the final mixture.  Very, very good.

I did not like this recipe very much at all.  In fact I threw most of this salad out shortly after making it and tasting it myself.  In brief, there was way too much pasta and not much taste.  As suggested by the other reviewer I even doubled the feta and olives..but the flavor was still lacking.  I MIGHT try again with green and red peppers and some other fresh veggies.

My husband loved this recipe.  It was very tasty and more importantly, it was so easy to make.  It's a great recipe if you plan on having a group of people over, especially since it tastes just as cold, as is warm.   Basically you can't go wrong.

SOOOOO GOOD!  I also use undrained tuna in oil as some other members mentioned.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!  I was really skeptical about trying this at first but I am so glad I did, so easy and quick and it's a delicious left over the next day.

TOOOOO DRYYYYYYY!!!! I followed the recipe regarding the amounts of wet ingrediants, however, it needed something added to it. Personally, I added a little more olive oil, with some balsamic. My sister added mayo instead, and seemed to like it that way too. Also, more olives and definately more crumbled feta next time.

Other than all that, a great concept of a salad.

This dish was delicious!! I found bucatini pasta which I googled and is apparently the same as perciatelli pasta (long spaghetti-like pasta that is hollow).
I didn't have fresh basil, but added some chopped green onion. I loved the lemony flavor through the dish! It was a hit at the family dinner table and went in no time! So easy - will make it again for sure.

I registered on allrecipes just so that I could leave this review. As others have noted, it doesn't seem as good as it will taste! I made the following changes:
- Trader Joe's lemon papardelle for the pasta
- 3x the garlic
- smoked salmon instead of tuna (I lent my can opener out and was in a bind -- with very delicious results!)
- no fresh parsley or basil, but 2 tbsp. dried basil
I made this without the feta. The combination of lemon, olive oil, olives, and pine nuts resulted in a killer, creamy taste and texture. I will try it again with the tuna and fresh herbs next time!

Sounded so odd, but I am glad I tried it.  I use the Tonno Tuna in Oil and it makes a great quick and satisfying meal.

I halved it more or less, came out great for lunches over greens tomatoes and cucumbers.  It didn’t need the feta, but I added extra olives. There’s enough for two tomorrow as well.

I served this cold and added more fetta and pine nuts than recipe says.  I also toasted and salted the pine nuts.  Next time I may use an Italian or Greek salad dressing instead.

It was decent, I added a hint of sweetness with some dried figs and canned artichoke hearts to balance out some of the flavours, which made it good

Very good and hubby liked it too.  Made it almost as written except I didn't have Pine nuts so I used chopped walnuts, and I used half the pasta called for.  Used fresh herbs, dried do not compare.  Used kalamata olives, black olives don't add the same punch.  The only thing that made it less than absolutely perfect was the tuna I used.  It was packed in oil but an ordinary brand.  Next time I'll use Tonno or Genoa.  Thanks!

I really liked this. Added some cherry tomatoes and some black olives. We only had a couple kalamatas left. I was dubious about the tuna at first, since I've never seen it in any recipes like this before, but it was alright. Really like pasta salads like this.

I make this all the time now, just following the recipe as and idea of what ingredients to add. Adjusting it to how much I want to make. I love this stuff.

I need more quick and easy dishes like this one!

I halved the pasta, oil, tuna and olives. I added probably twice the fresh parsley. I only had dried basil so I sprinkled that on. I also added half a small zucchini, minced, just to get the added fresh veg, since that's what I had in the fridge.

I used super high quality tuna, btw. Wild planet wild skipjack.

This was a good, easy, easy to clean up dinner! It's not so excellent that I would serve it to guests, but my husband ate second helpings and my 4yo and 2yo cleaned their plates. Success!

Didn't have pine nuts, but I'll add them next time. Use more feta than recipe calls for.

This is a very impressive recipe for being so "quick and easy." The first time I prepared it I found the (very delicious) flavor a little mild for my taste. I still would have given the original recipe five stars, and I think that the original is more likely to be "kid-friendly" than my adapted version. Either way, to suit my own preferences, on my second try I scaled back on the pasta by 25%, doubled the cheese, substituted for half the olive oil with olive juice from the can, and added a couple tablespoons of chopped bacon pieces and about 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper. The end result was much saucier and the flavor punchier. My husband and I liked the added gusto. =)

Kids really liked it!  I didn't have the pine nuts nor the olives and my son is allergic to milk so I just made do.  Next time I will definitely put in the olives.  Great recipe to play with or create as recipe states.
