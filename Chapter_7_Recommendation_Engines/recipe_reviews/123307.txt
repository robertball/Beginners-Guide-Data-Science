I made this twice so far. The first time I thought there was something missing so the next time I added 1/3 c. brown sugar to the bouillon/soy sauce/cornstarch mixture and it was so good. It made it much much better.

Soooo good! This was super quick and easy to make. I took one of the suggestions and added about 1/3 c. of brown sugar to the soy mixture before cooking; I also used frozen (thawed) stir-fry veggies with the fresh carrots and red bell pepper--this gave me enough to feed six people! I only used 3/4 lb. of sirloin which was plenty, even with the extra veggies. I'm eating the left-overs right now! I will definitely make this again and again :)

I have been making asian food for a while and this is the first recipe I found that we love. I adjusted the veggies to what was on hand and added a little red pepper flakes with 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Very Good!

Wow, we just made this & it was, as my husband put it "AWESOME", coming from my husband this is very high praise since he always says to new recipes it's "alright" or "okay". We left out the ginger, personal preference. Used frozen veggies, but will definitely use fresh next time, nothing beats fresh produce. Frozen certainly would do in a pinch. Make this as is & it is amazing. A definite keeper!!

I found this and asked my wife to make it for me. It was so good. She put in a few extras and instead of corn starch she used flour. We like it a bit more saucy. She also added a bit of brn sugar. It was better than most take out.

I loosely followed the recipe but I added my own spin as I thought this could use a little “oomph.”   I used chicken broth rather than beef bouillon and water, and added just a smidge of mirin (2 T.) and brown sugar (I T.). I don’t like ginger, so I eliminated it altogether.  For the vegetables, I simply used cremini mushrooms and the whites of scallions.  Always mindful of “bad” carbs, I served this over Shirataki (no carb, no calorie) rice and braised baby bok choy.  I can’t believe how much I ate.

Five stars just isn't enough!  This was incredible!!  Yes, the meat and vegetables are an integral part of any Asian recipe, but if the sauce is bad, it ruins the whole dish.  Yes, I did some minor tweaking for personal preferance, but the sauce was delicious.  Made with boullion, no less!In all my years of cooking I've never made an Asian dish that I (or my family) really liked - until tonight.  Even my 9-yr-old Mr Finicky ate it.  That's reason enough to make this a keeper!  I can't wait to try this with chicken.

My husband like the recipe.  He felt it needed more soy sauce.  I added water chestnuts, which we love.  I also did not use any cornstarch due to another rating I read, because we wanted our saucier also.  I added a couple tablespoons of flour instead and it was just perfect consistency.

This was really good.  I followed the suggestions of others who omitted the cornstarch and added two rounded tablespoons of flour.  This worked well and the sauce was the right consistency for us.  I used veggies from a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and added some fresh peppers and celery.  I think that next time I will double the ginger.  Love it!

Very simple and easy to prepare.  Easy to find ingredients. I served this with brown rice, none was leftover. A little salty probably due to boillion and soy sauce- Next time I will try low sodium products. Will make this again .

This was super easy and tasted good. I followed the directions exactly using carrots. My husband said it was a little bitter but I didn't notice that. Next time I will take some of the reviewer's advice and will add a touch of brown sugar.

This is my new favorite way to make stir fry! I followed some others advice and cut the cornstarch in half. I used frozon asain mix veggies and it was still great. Definitely making this again.

Good & I will try it again.  However, I'm going to half or quarter the cornstarch...this recipe made the sauce way too thick for my liking.

I wanted to follow this recipe completely, but couldn't. I used cubed steak since it's what I had on hand. I cut it in thin strips as the recipe calls for. I didn't realize I was out of beef bouillon and didn't have any beef broth either. I substituted it with a cup of Progresso French onion soup, but followed the steps as if I was using beef bouillon. Let me tell you, this dish was amazing! There was not one spec of food left in the pan. Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe! I almost added the brown sugar as others suggested, but am glad I didn't! This was perfect :o)

This was terrible. I doubled the recipe and it ended up being super salty. I had to put a lot of brown sugar in just to make it edible. I would recommend cutting back on the soy sauce and taste as you go along, adding more if necessary.

Sauce was far too thick for my liking, trying to thin it out without losing flavor was difficult.  Nothing special as far as flavor, either.

This was by far one of the best stir-fries that I have ever had!  I added snow peas, water chestnuts and some cashews to give it a nice crunch. Fantastic meal!

This recipe was not horrible however I agree with some viewers as it was waaaayyyy too salty and I am not the type to shy away from salt. I actually had to pore some of the sauce out, add water and more corn starch. I also added mushrooms and 1/2 tsp of sherry, which improved the taste as well. Other then that it was pretty good.

A really good recipe.  I substituted 1 cup of low sodium beef broth instead of using beef bouillon granules...I needed to reduce the salt.  That was the only change I made.  The flavor was really good...not too sweet...just tasty.  Will be using this one regularly

This was fantastic!  So simple, and yet it turned out better than most of my other stir-fry attempts.  I used last night's leftover beef, and I subbed water chestnuts for the carrots and a red onion for the green, otherwise followed directions.  Was just looking for an easy Wednesday dinner and found the perfect stir-fry.  I'm going to try the chicken modification next.  Thanks for posting this!

A wonderful dish. I used all fresh vegetables. Green pepper, red pepper, broccoli, carrots, snap peas, shitake mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. The next time I make it I will experiment with some other favorite veggies and I think I will try it by adding brown sugar like some other people suggested. I liked it as it was but I also like the sweet and salty flavors so am willing to try this both ways.

This was pretty good and easy. I used 1 cup of beef stock instead of bouillon/water and I added 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used a mix of carrots and celery (used up whatever I had) and served over brown rice. I found it to be tasty and saucy-definitely not too much cornstarch. I'll definitely try it again!

Love this recipe. I also added 1/3 cup of brown sugar, as was suggested. Instead of serving over rice, I cooked half of a one pound  package of rice sticks, and then added them to the stir fry. Everyone asked for seconds. Thanks for the great recipe.

Pretty good. Tasted just like Chinese food but not nearly as salty and oily. The 1/3 cup brown sugar is a must.

Delicious!  I added the brown sugar as others have and used beef broth instead of bouillon, just because I had some already.  I also added a bag of mixed veggies I had (carrots/corn/green beans) so my kids would eat it.  They won't eat peppers.  They liked it and I did too.  Might try it on brown rice next time just so it's healthier.  Try it!

My family loves this. I do something different every time I make it. The original way is good but sometimes I just use some of the stir fry mixes they sell in the freezer section.

I made this recipe and it was pretty good but I did make some changes. I didn't use any beef bullion and instead cut up garlic and sauteed in a little bit of oil, added a tablespoon of ground fresh chili paste. Then I added a few tablespoons of brown sugar, a splash of rice vinegar, and a few splashes of soy sauce. This is what I cooked the steak in. Then I removed the steak after it was finished, and put my frozen bag of stir fry vegetables in the wok to cook up the rest of the sauce. Then I cooked the rice, put the meat back in with the vegetables, mixed it all together- YUM!!!

love love love this! so easy and so healthy with all the veggies. Frozen work fine but fresh veggies, whatever is in season (ahem.. cheap), make this awesome. Use fresh ginger and you won't be sorry. Only difference is I marinated the beef with the garlic ginger and pepper and little bit of soy sauce. I also added the brown sugar as others suggested. Weekly Rotation :)

This had good flavor but I think it would have been better if the beef had been marinated.  What's really nice about this recipe is that a small amount of beef thinly sliced goes a long way and looks so much more than is actually there.  I used  low-sodium bouillon  & soy sauce so I didn't have the salty issue that other reviewers mentioned.

Ooooohhhh Yaaaa, this one is a keeper, for sure.  I did a little (know I shouldn't ) Dr. ing up,I used 1 bag of “Deluxe Stir fry”  from Wal-mart, some mushrooms.  I also added a little over 1/4 c. splenda brown sugar and didn’t have beef bullion so used  1 cup of lower sodium chicken broth and 1/3 c. low sodium soy sauce with the corn starch. My Hubby is still raving about it.  I think I'll try using Chicken next time.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Tasty, though I did add 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the sauce before adding it to the vegetables in the skillet.  Glad I did, I don't think I would have liked this as much without it.  Next time, I might add some red pepper flakes for a little kick, and perhaps a hint less soy sauce.  Seemed a little too salty.

This was great. A very easy but filling recipe. Used the Great Value frozen snap pea stir fry and it turned out amazing. The whole family, including my four year old, loved it. Will be making this again for sure.

This was my first attempt at making stir-fry, and I'm so pleased with how it turned out. I added baby corn, and unfortunately, I did not have any ginger, so I substituted a pinch of cinnamon (it worked out alright). The end result was a bit bland- next time I'd add more garlic, perhaps a bit of red pepper flakes, and perhaps some other seasonings to kick things up a bit.

This was WAY too salty and I even used reduced sodium soy sauce.  I usually like salt, but this was too much.  I also didn't find it very flavorful, it was pretty bland.  I used frozen veggies, but don't think that should make much of a difference.  Won't be making again.

This has great flavor! Will definitely add this into our regular meal rotation.
I made some changes:
I did not add ginger b/c I did not have it and we aren't huge ginger fans. I only added 1 T of cornstarch so the sauce was very watery but that really didn't bother anyone. I also added a ton of fresh veggies: baby bok choy, asparagus, red peppers, shredded carrots, mushrooms and sugar snap peas.
Some people said to add brown suger -- I will never do that. I liked it as is -- but I also prefer salty over sweet. I just bought a pack of pre-cut stew meat -- cheap and it tasted just fine.

Most reviewers said that this was too salty - I recommend using flour instead of cornstarch. After making it, I also felt something was missing so added 1/3 cup brown sugar as previously recommended, mixed with a little bit of water. Let it simmer for about a minute and voila! Definately one of my favourite simple recipes. Wthout a doubt!

Came out really well. I tried the flour instead of cornstarch, but the sauce still came out really thick. Next time I think I'll reduce the amount. Hubby loved it and can't wait for me to make it again.

Absolutely loved it. My boyfried and I ate the whole pan in one sitting. I added 1/3 cup brown sugar like the other reviewers. I only used one onion instead of five and used green, yellow, and red peppers (each one cut in half). Delicious!

My family really liked this. I doubled the sauce and marinated the meat in Teryaki sauce for a couple of hours before cooking. I found it to be a little salty... maybe the teryaki but I am going to modify the recipe next time to use low sodium ingredients. Other than the saltiness, really yummy and easy to make.

This was pretty good, I'd make it again simply because it was so fast and easy.  I got everything cut/chopped and cooked before the (white) rice was done cooking; that's less than 25 minutes.  Next time I'll try it with broccoli instead of the green pepper.

I have made this several times with rave reviews.  As other suggested, I added brown sugar and change up the veggies for what I have on hand.  I use low sodium soy sauce so there is no way this too salty.  I am making it as I type. Thanks for the recipe

I fixed this dish tonight and it was awesome. I used sliced sirloin roast (medium rare), frozen stir fry vegetables and 1/4 cup brown sugar. It's now in my recipe file.

I've tried lots of stir fry recipes but finally I found this one, it was easy and delicious. I added other veggies (mushrooms, broccoli, snow peas) and didn't use green peppers. I also added brown sugar as others have suggested. The sauce was really good and not too much as the veggies stayed crisp not soggy like other recipes I've tried. I'll make this again and again.

The soy sauce taste overrides everything and much too salty. Won't make again. Prefer a more orient flavor than so much soy sauce.

I LOVE this recipe, I have been making stir frys using this recipe for a year now.  My daughter requests this for dinner all the time!  The only changes I've made are for personal preference (no onions or peppers) but I will add onion powder and per other peoples suggestions I always add about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar it really makes it awesome!  I toss in a bag of frozen sugar snap peas or some other stir fry medley.

We've recently gone vegetarian so I make this and omit meat/poultry (yes I had also made this using chicken, just as yummy but dark in color due to the soy sauce) and it's super delicious!  The sauce over rice alone is worth making!!!  The next time I get the urge to make this I'm going to freeze some of the sauce in ice cube trays to make cooking this dish quicker in a pinch! :)

We've tried using low sodium soy sauce but it tasted off.

Very yummy! I used low sodium soy sauce since the bouillon has plenty. Fresh veggies with fresh cut of steak, made for a fresh, bright and savory meal!  :)

This recipe is so good - I added 1/3 cup of brown sugar a touch of Oyster sauce and added some Sesame oil at the end instead of the Veg oil.

We love stir fry in this house, and this is a great recipe for it! I didn't have any onions, so I'm sure that changed up the flavor some. But I did add some frozen peas that I had in the deep freeze, and I thought that was a great addition! I also used both green and yellow peppers. I loved the flavor in this, it was great!

This recipe was very easy to make. When I did the taste test of the sauce it was alittle bitter for me so I put some sugar in it for taste and it was great. I will make this one for sure again

Wow! This was great! I had some steak in the freezer I needed to use up. I thawed in out and cut it into strips and marinated it for a couple hours in soy sauce before making this.  Cooked the steak in olive oil and the soy sauce it was marinating in. I just used carrots and sugar snap peas because that is what we like and cooked them in 1 Tb olive oil and 1 Tb sesame oil.  The sauce is so yummy!  Over brown rice this was WAY better than any take-out! Thanks for a great, quick and easy stir-fry recipe!

I make this recipe often and it is delicious and very versatile. I have substituted chicken and chicken bouillon for the beef and beef bouillon and it is just as tasty. For the veggies, I often just use the frozen stir-fry veggie mix from Costco and it's delicious!
