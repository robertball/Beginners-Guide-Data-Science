DANGER:  do NOT use a tube pan for this recipe.  My 14 year old daughter wanted to make these for Christmas morning, said she could do it herself and now has burns on both hands.   A tube pan is a 2 piece unit...when my daughter took it out of the oven, the molten, 350 degree melted sugar poured from the bottom all over her hands.  :o((((((  While the taste of this recipe was good (she insisted we eat it while she sat with bandaged hands), the price was NOT worth it.  If you are going to make this recipe, use a bundt pan, NOT a tube pan.

I altered the recipe a bit on directions from a friend.  I used finely chopped pecans (instead of the walnuts) and 1/2 package of butterscotch pudding mix(cook and serve kind only).  I sprayed a teflon bundt pan with Pam, poured in the pecans, sprinkled them with the dry pudding mix.  Then I quartered BUTTERMILK (these keep moist much better during cooking) biscuits and rolled each piece in the cinnamon/sugar mixture and layered it on top of the pecans.  Three cans of Pillsbury's filled my pan exactly.  Then I poured the brown sugar/butter mixture on top and baked it for about 40minutes and turned it over on a serving platter....it didn't stick at all, looked BEAUTIFUL, tasted absolutely delicious and gooey (I had no hard bottom layer, it was moist throughout).  Will make for every birthday breakfast, holiday breakfast, etc for years to come....a recipe to pass down!

Very good recipe BUT, DO USE A BUNDT PAN. 
I used a tube pan like one uses for an Angel Food Cake. You should see the bottom of my oven and the racks,looking like baked on Stalactites!!! Instead of the inviting aroma of cinnamon, my house is filled with the stench of burning brown sugar and butter.

Fun to make & Delicious to eat!  I cut the recipe into 1/3 and only used 1 can of biscuits in an 8" round cake pan.  Cooked for about 20 minutes.  My 2 & 1/2 year old enjoyed helping me roll the balls.  Also, previous reviewer suggested using a pizza cutter to cut the biscuits--great shortcut!

Easy and delicious!  One of the better Monkey Bread recipes out there, IMO.  For those who want to rate it low or pan it with bad reviews because it's sweet or has too much fat for them, bug off!  If you don't want to make it, don't - no one is forcing you to by posting their recipes!  Please feel free to go eat nuts, stones and raw grains and keep your judgmental self-righteous opinions to yourselves!  Reviews are FOR THOSE WHO'VE MADE THE RECIPE!   For what it IS  - which is a gooey, sweet TREAT that NO ONE is advocating ANYONE eat on a daily basis - this recipe is a good one.  Rant off.

This was fantastic. Followed one suggestion by flipping it over onto cake plate before it cooled and the sugar mixture just seeped all the way through - perfect. This is delicious, easy and kids can help make it! Thanks for sharing!

To make this recipe even quicker, use a pizza cutter to cut up the biscuits.  Add a tsp of lecithin, (full recipe) with the butter, to keep the butter from separating from the caramel.   I reduced the recipe to one tube of biscuits and baked it in a 8 in round pan.  They were done in 12 min.  A quick addition to a any breakfast.

This was better than the recipe my mom used (and I loved) when I was a kid!  I incurred a problem though when I filled the fluted pan and the loaf pan too full; the caramel spilled over onto the bottom of the oven.  The loaf pan should only be about half full, 2/3 for the Bundt pan.  The dough seemed to double in size!  WONDERFUL breakfast treat for my family and I!!!

This is a winner!!! I have made it for several years and am ALWAYS asked for the recipe.  You couldn't ask for an easier, more delicious breakfast treat.  My husband has to bring a treat for a weekly morning meeting about every 6 weeks and everyone loves when it is his turn because they know I will be making this.  I am going to have to start making two.

It never fails to amaze me that there are people out there that think they are the only one who knows how to cook.  Then they start to tear the receipe apart that LuAnn was gracious enough to share.  I think this recipe is delish EXACTLY as written.  If you want to alter it, go right ahead, but don't be rude and say it was too sweet, or you need to do this and don't do that, be nice and keep your comments to yourself, as for me?  I will enjoy this wonderful recipe and enjoy all the sugar and butter and smile while I eat it, after all, you don't have to sit there and eat the whole thing!  Mmmmm pour me another cup of coffee with this, will ya?

I knew the oven would be fully occupied on Christmas day, so I prepared this on Christmas Eve to have on Christmas morning.   We all LOVED it! Even baked the night before and reheated, it was excellent!  My father is very, very set in his ways and an extremely tough crowd when it comes to 'new' foods.  He kept going back for more! I used 2 cans of the Grands biscuits instead of three regular and it was the perfect amount.  It didn't look like it at first glance, but man, how it swells! The only other change I made was to use a bundt pan instead of a tube pan.  Laid out some wax paper and flipped it while still hot, as other suggested to let the goo ooze throughout. Delicious!  This is seriously one of the easiest and tastiest things ever.  I served it with a side of frosting from Clone of a Cinnabon recipe on this site...smearing it on top seemed like it would make it a little too sweet.  But the two compliment each other wonderfully.  As we speak, I have another in the oven to give to our neighbor for snowblowing our walkway.  You won't regret trying this recipe! 

Note:  If you plan to flip your monkey bread after baking, reserve some of the brown sugar mixture and reheat with a little more butter after the bread has finished baking.  Pour over the bread to glaze the top and sprinkle with nuts...makes it look at great as it tastes.

This is a great easy recipe, but I made the following changes based on my experience as a professional baker.  I poured the melted margarine on the biscuit pieces first and mixed until coated.  Then mixed the brown sugar, white sugar and cinnamon all together (if adding raisins or nuts do it here)  then added a little water to it to make a goo.  Then poured the goo over the biscuits and mixed together until all coated and gooey. This way it comes out gooey and bubbly like a sticky bun!

Scrumptious!  I used frozen yeast roll dough to get a more homemade yeast bread flavor and the results were outstanding!  You can make it the night before this way:  thaw 18 golf ball size raw yeast rolls over about an hour.  Once thawed, cut each in half.  Follow the recipe for coating and layering.  After pouring the brown sugar mixture over dough, place in cold oven overnight to rise.  Follow baking instructions in the morning.  Absolutely perfect!  The entire extended family loved it!!!

This is so delicious! I omitted the nuts and raisins. Instead of 1/2 cup margarine I used 3/4 of a cup of butter and instead of 3 cans of biscuit dough I used 2. My bunt cake pan would not have held 3 cans of dough. Next time I will put in one can of biscuit dough and pour over 1/2 of the butter brown sugar mix. Then put in the remainder of the dough and top with remainder of brown sugar butter mixture.

My hubby adores this bread, but I had to make it 4 times before I perfected it. I use a four pack of biscuits. I'll put about 2 cans of biscuits in the pan and then pour a little over half of the caramel mixture over them. Top with the rest of the biscuits and then the rest of the caramel. I've also found the I need to make a little more caramel than called for. I use 1 cup of unsalted butter, 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar, and add a little vanilla(about 1 TSP) and some milk (maybe 2 or 3 TBS). It's very good, and rarely a weekend goes by without a mention of how nice some monkey bread would be.

Use pre-made bread dough if you want to avoid the globs of transfats that are in the biscuits.

Great recipe but I should have read the reviews first. 

next time I will scale it down a little and only use 2 cans of biscuits as well as drizzle the sauce between the layers.

I used a bundt as I've only ever seen monkey bread served that way and used pecans and my husband does not like walnuts. 

Also i recommend covering the top with aluminum foil so the top dosent burn while the inside is still cooking.

I will make again thanks so much.

I used 2 cans of biscuits instead of 3 and it was good.  There was not enough of the icing on all of the bread if you used 3 cans.

Perfect! The second batch I made, I put about 1/4 c milk in w/the butter and brown sugar which seemed to make the bread a bit more moist. My mom used to make this years ago and couldn't remember the recipe - I have been craving it. Thanks!!

This is a great breakfast treat - tastes like sticky buns, but pulls apart.  I always spray the bundt pan with Pam so everything comes out easy.  I do nuts and raisins and add 1 tsp. of vanilla to the butter and brown sugar mixture.  When it's done, just invert the whole thing onto a plate and get out a ton of napkins!

Quick to make and easy to do.  It's a recipe I will enjoy making with my grandchildren.  So many steps that are easy for them to do and I know they will enjoy eating it.  I would, however, double the margarine and brown sugar and spread it in the middle as well as on top.  (As many suggested and I learned the hard way!  lol)  Using a pizza wheel to cut the dough is a great idea.  (as previously suggested)  For safety reasons, I would not use a two-piece pan when working with children as they could get burned by the syrup.  (as a reviewer previously wrote) If you do use a two-piece pan, line the bottom with wax paper and it will not leak.  (I did it that way as I did not have a bunt pan). It can be sliced with a serated knife and eaten with a fork. Warmed for 15 seconds in the microwave the next day and it is as good as fresh baked.   Thank you, LuAnn, for sharing such a great recipe. Update: For Valentine's day my granddaughter, Rachel, made mini bundt cakes with my assistance.  Fill the pan almost to the top, as it will "grow" as it cooks.  We know, ours grew out of the pan; but, it gave us some laughs!

Loved it  I have made this before, but this time I added about a teaspoon of pure vanilla to the butter/brown sugar mixture and it was delicious.

Great recipe! I saw this featured on a cooking show once and was incredibly intrigued, only they had modified it putting small chunks of cream cheese inside the dough puffs before baking. I did the same at home and these turned out fabulous. I also took others' advice to use a bundt pan, and layered the cinnamon sugar with the brown sugar and butter on every row. I omitted the raisins and used pecans since I didn't have any walnuts on hand. These turned out absolutely delicious. Careful though - they're highly addictive.

I used the Hungry Jack cinanmon and sugar biscuits.  Because everyone wanted a "sweet roll", I still (lightly) rolled them in 1/2 the sugar-cinnamon mixture.  Since my bundt pan was a 12-cup, and the Hungry Jack biscuits come in 10 ounce quantity, I used 4 cans.  It was the hit of Christmas morning!

Try adding 1 cup of vanilla ice cream to sauce pan while warming up the butter and brown sugar.  Makes them creamy and and keep the brown sugar from getting hard on the bread.  It makes ALL the difference!

I had 1 container of the pillsbury cinnamon bun dough in my fridge and figured I would use that instead of the regular biscuit dough. I was worried that the rolled bun shapes would fall apart when I cut them into quarters but they didn't at all. I think the secret is to do it when the dough is really cold and then once they're coated in the sugar/cinnamon mixture it keeps each piece together. I cut the rest of the recipe into 1/3 except I used a little less brown sugar in the glaze because I figured there was enough in the dough already. I also used a bundt pan, and omitted the raisins because we don't like them. It took 25 minutes to cook. My boyfriend LOVED this. I made it for breakfast and the two of us finished it off. He said I definitely had to give this one 5 stars. Great recipe.

This was my first time making this dish and I learned a valuable lesson and had to share.  I overcooked the butter and sugar thinking it had to be creamy and ultimately made caramel.  This made the bread hard after baking but it was still tasty.  The kid's loved it but we had to eat it fast or it would have turned to rock caramel candy.  

FABULOUS DISH... JUST DO NOT COOK THE BROWN SUGAR AND BUTTER LONGER THAN 1 MINUTE!  

I'm sure many expert cook's out there would have known better, but this rookie wish that point would have been mentioned in the recipe.

So so good! Used Pecans instead of walnuts and left out the raisins, all because of personal preference. The caramel sauce is absolutely heaven! Of course I used real butter instead of margarine and added a pinch of kosher salt to the sauce, because I am IN LOVE with the sweet/salty caramel taste. My bread was a bit hard on the top but I think I cooked my caramel sauce just a little too long and it was really thick so it didnt seep down into the bread as much as I would have liked. Otherwise this was the bomb! Burned my fingers and tongue because I could not wait for it to cool any!

Absolutely Scrumptious!  Cooked this for Christmas breakfast using 1 can of biscuits with the coated pieces arranged in a 9" pie dish drizzled with the brown sugar sauce & it came out perfectly.  The family loved it, especially the kids...a definite keeper! Thanx.

Great recipe!! I did use about 3 tbs. less butter and it worked out fine for the topping.
I failed to read other ratings before making this! I wish I had!
If you make this, **USE A BUNDT PAN!! I used a tube pan and regret it!
**If you use GRANDS biscuits, only use 2 or 2.5 packagaes. I used these and the middle was undercooked!

This Monkey Bread was out of control!  Excellent.  I brought it to a Christmas party and everyone loved it.  I did not have a bundt pan so I used two cake pans and it came out very good.  Although, I had a lot of biscuit dough leftover (because of the lack of a bundt pan) so I doubled up the dough on one pan and it actually came out better because it was more moist inside.

This was very good..I changed a few things.  I used two tubes of biscuits, 20 biscuits in total and cut into quarters, used a muffin tin so I would have individual servings.  I used about 3/4 c of sugar instead of 1 cup.  Put 5 pieces of dough in each muffin tin then topped with brown sugar/butter mixture.(didn't use margarine)  Baked for 18 minutes and popped them out of the pan when cool.  Omitted the nuts and raisins.

Excellent recipe, but as another reviewer said, use a bundt pan, not a tube pan. I used the tube pan and the butter leaked out and started a fire on the bottom of the oven!

I used refrigerated cinnamon rolls in a tube instead of the biscuits. I can't stand refrigerated biscuits. This is a good recipe but better with the cinnamon rolls. You can use the packet of icing that comes with the tube of cinnamon rolls if you wish.

This was the hit of the party! Absolutely wonderful!  The only tips I could offer would be to make sure you don't press down on the dough balls once you get them in the pan, or else the sauce won't make it all the way through the loaf and get it all gooey and delicious on the inside. Also, I'd make about 50% more sauce than the recipe calls for, because people seem to go for the parts that have the most sauce.

YUMMY!!  This was buttery, chewy and just plain delish!  It was so easy to make...i used 2 cans flakey buscuits and the amount was just right for our family. I kept all the other ingredient amounts the same and it was perfect.  I almost think that 3 cans with the liquid would make a bit dry.  I will for sure make this on the weekends

Since I only had 1-16 oz. can of flaky layers dough, I used a smaller tube pan, 1/3 c. of sugar, 1 tsp. cinn. Then for the amt. of dough I had, I used 2/3 C. brn. sugar & 1 stick butter. I think the syrup needs to be doubled everytime...just drench the bread btwn layers.It feels like its too much, but when it comes out, its perfect!Used nuts/raisins on 1/4 of it(mine:) Baked 30 min.No one should be unhappy w/ this delicious concoction! Thanks LuAnn

Perfect monkey bread recipe. Like others say, if you use a tube pan put something underneath to catch the mess.

Delicious and easy. Made this Christmas morning and it disappeared by the end of the day. The tip about being sure to turn the pan onto a plate while it's still warm is correct. Also, next time I may pour the sugar sauce midway through, then add the rest of the biscuits, then pour the rest on to more evenly distribute it. Overall, though, a hit.

Excellent!  I don’t use walnuts or raisins, just the bread.  GREAT recipe for kids, a little messy, but so easy, and they love to eat it.  This is a favorite, and an awesome alternative to bread in the fall.

My husband begged me to make this bread for him and when I did, he loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.  We have taken it to work several times and received rave reviews.  I always carry home an empty pan.

Very good, but the butter/brown sugar mixture leaked out the bottom of the pan. (I used a pan that is for angel food cake...2 pieces). Excellent besides that.

OM Gosh!! It was soo gooey & tasty. I usually have something I change on these recipes but this one I followed exactly with the exception of how many raisins. I just sprinkled til it looked good ;-) I will add nuts next time. Since they are soo expensive, I chose to wait to see if I liked the recipe..

I've been making this recipe for many years. I use 4 pkgs of the biscuits, put whole pecans in the bottom of a bundt pan. I bake it for 30 minutes or until medium brown on top. As soon as it's done, I flip it over on to a large plate or cookie sheet lined with foil. I also cut the biscuits with a scissors. I do not use raisins.

I always make tweaks on this recipe. I spray my tube pan with baking spray and spread chopped pecans evenly in the bottom of the bundt pan.  I use butter instead of margarine and I do not add raisins because some family members do not like them.  After mixing the butter and brown sugar and about halfway between layering the coated biscuit quarters, I drizzle some of the brown sugar/butter mixture over the biscuit quarters.  I finish layering the remaining dough and on the top I drizzle the remaining brown sugar and butter.  I bake for about 40 minutes, allow to cool and then combine about 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and 2 T. of milk and drizzle over the bread once it is removed from the pan. My family and friends enjoy this  easy recipe.

We LOVED this recipe!! I boiled the raisins in a little water, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to plump them back up before adding them. My 6 year old helped me make it, very easy kid friendly dish!

This is really yummy, but not exactly gooey like I would like.  I've made it twice and both times it's kind of hard on top.  I used butter instead of margarine. I really want to like this...

I made this for my daughter's Birthday breakfast the night before.   I substituted the (3) cans of biscuits with (3) cans of refrigerated crescent rolls.   I made approx. 4 to 5 balls out of each cresent triangle and followed the rest of the recipe as written.   It made the monkey bread taste like it was made in a bakery.  Very light and flaky on the inside but slightly crispy on the outside that added a nice compliment to the butter/brown sugar syrup.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the syrup as others suggested.  This recipe is a keeper!

I tried this three times in a bundt pan...first in a flexible silicone type, and then in a metal one.  All three times was a failure...the part on top after I flipped the bread out was a gooey doughy mess every time.  The bottom where it baked was delicious, but still wasted over half from it not baking.  If anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate them.  Was hoping to make this for a fundraiser coming up.

This is a great tasting bread but one of the "drier" monkey bread recipes I've tried-if you like more of a caramel coating increase the butter and brown sugar....

Not only do my kids love it, but the neighborhood children come around asking

Loved this!!! My only complaint was the syrup was a bit too buttery/oily. Next time, I will increase the brown sugar. I also used more cinnamon in the cinnamon/sugar mixture. I used 3, 14 oz cans of flaky biscuits in a large bundt and they cooked up perfectly. Bakers tip* tent a piece of foil (spray with baking spray) over pan for the first 15 - 20 min of baking and you wont have an undercooked center. I let it cool for 10 min and then turned it onto my serving platter and let the syrup run through the cake. Once cooled, I froze the cake and took it out the morning of my New Years Party. It was fantastic. I drizzled with a simple glaze & it was a great addition to my sweet table and froze up beautifully. No one would ever know I had made it ahead of time. Gotta love a time saver!!!!

OK.  I give it four stars because the cooking time was a bit off.  After 35 minutes, it was not done in the middle.  So, I baked it in 10 minute intervals until it was done.  Total baking time was ~60 minutes in a dark-coated, non-stick tube pan.  (Note: To prevent the pan from leaking, put a piece of foil in the pan under the tube and tear off the excess.  Don't forget to spray the pan with Pam before you line it.)

I also made some tweaks to the recipe.  I added a bit of allspice & nutmeg, as well as, more cinnamon to the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Also, I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, margarine to 1/3 cup, and added a good squeeze of honey (~1/8-1/4 cup), cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, a dash of vanilla & a dash of salt (salt enhances sweets) to the sauce.  I brushed each layer with a bit of sauce and sprinkled chopped pecans.  Then, poured the remaining sauce over the top and sprinkled with remaining pecans.

Overall, everybody said it was really good.  So, if it wasn't for the cooking time, I probably would have given it five stars.

Wonderful recipe!  I used only 2 cans of biscuits and I tried to proportionately cut back on the other ingredients.  I just kinda "winged it".  It turned out fabulous and the 2 cans totally filled up my bunt pan.  Easy, fun to make, and so delicious.  Definitely a 5 star recipe!

I have made this twice in two weeks! I use a smaller bundt pan so I use two rolls of dough and it fits perfectly with no overflow.I leave out the raisins and nuts because of a picky eater and the recipe is without a doubt five stars anyway. One note, this is something you want to eat warm from the oven. It will harden up after sitting. You can re-heat it a bit later on the same day and it is fine, but by the following day it's really not as good. So don't make it a day ahead if you are bringing it for an event.

I love this!  So simple!  I use the can biscuit dough by Pillsbury that is simple ingredients (sorry I can't remember the exact name but it's a white can).  When I make this, no one knows it's canned biscuit dough.  Also, I cut the biscuits with a pizza cutter.  Super simple and quick.  Also, some people have had issues with burns.  People, this recipe has hot, molten sugar that you pour over the top of biscuit dough.  If you are on here I assume that you, at the very least, have an interest in cooking; therefore, you know it involves a hot oven with hot ingredients.  All sarcasm aside, if you are careful then you won't get burned.  My Monkey Bread has never spilled over in the oven, but again, I prepare that it might.  So, I put a separate pan under my Bundt pan to catch any spills I might have.  I do everything exactly as the recipe states and everyone LOVES it.  I can't say enough about it.

I signed up for allrecipes just to add a review for this. It was definitely easy to make! I cut down the recipe to 1 canister of pillsbury because I don't have a tube pan and saw another reviewer say they used a baking pan with 1 canister. Believe me, that's all you need. When this is done baking, you got yourself a full baking pan of monkey bread! I used Homestyle Biscuits from Pillsbury and cut the biscuit into 6 pieces so that it was more bite size friendly and had more area to cake in cinnamon and sugar. If you still have extra sugar and cinnamon I would suggest shaking the biscuits in it again. I've made this two times within 3 days because my boyfriend who is a picky eater kept asking for more! He asked the second day but I didn't have any more biscuits. This is so easy to make, I'll always have biscuits on hand to make it whenever the craving strikes!

Everyone in my family loves this (old and young)!!  Have made it quite a few times.  I always leave out the raisins, and use pecans instead of walnuts.  Have even tried it with 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  It's great any way you make it!  I chop the pecans finely and place them in the bundt pan first, dropping the dough on top of the pecans.  I flip it over onto a plate right after taking it out of the oven.  Great recipe!  Very, very good!!

Excellent!  No changed necessary!  I halved the recipe and used a loaf pan -- it came out perfectly.

Excellent, super good, and cheap to make.  You need to use a bundt pan, not tube.   I used cake release(Wilton) for the pan to ensure no sticking(had it on hand.  Added more cinnamon as I really love it.   When I took it out of the over I flipped it over on a flat sheet pan and did not lift bundt pan off.  I waited about 10mins which let all the gooey, yummy, brown sugar and butter topping to run down and coat the bread.  It turned out perfect..will make again and again =)

This is a 5 star recipe as long as you layer the sauce with the biscuits.  Otherwise the inside will be dry.  Very sweet and delicious!

I've had this recipe for over 20 years from my girl scout troop growing up.  It's a breakfast staple in our house, especially for Christmas morning :) also good if you throw a little pumpkin pie spice in instead of just cinnamon.

We make this on many mornings.  YUM! Kids and adults love.  Sugar rush! I buy 2 cans of Grans buttermilk biscuits, cut with scissors in 6 pieces. I find rolling in the cinnamon sugar easy and fun. Throw those in a bundt pan (mine has curves) that has been sprayed with Pam.  I melt BS and butter in microwave pour on and enjoy.  Easy, fun and oh so good.

This monkey bread is delicious!! I couldn't find 12 oz cans of biscuit dough, so I used two 16 oz cans. so as not to be wasteful, I also dumped the remaining sugar and cinnamon mixture from the bag into the melting mixture of butter and brown sugar. I never use raisins because I don't care for them, but this recipe is good with either walnuts or pecans.

I used to make this when I first got married. And had forgotten about it. That's been almost 25 years ago. Thank goodness for Allrecipes because I find forgotten recipes like this on here and scanning the site, I had found it. Made it last night, and it was such a huge hit!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!!! I will remember to make this again, and again!!!!!!

I had always been taught to make my monkey bread by rolling the dough in butter than the cinn sugar.  But I saw how highly reviewed this was, so I figured why not give it a try.  It's easier, less messy, and delicious.  Plus, it only uses 1/2 cup of butter.  Not that we're going for healthy here, but this recipe is probably just slightly better for you.

Very good monkey bread recipe, but make sure you put a cookie sheet under whatever you bake this in... I didn't have a bundt pan, so I used an aluminum cake pan, a lot of the syrup mixture over-flowed and burned the bottom of my oven :( still good tasting recipe though...just use a cookie sheet!

It was OK hot, not good after it cooled off. I'm not a fan of canned dough, its artificial taste was still apparent even doctored up with with the other ingredients. There are so many delicious recipes out there for sweets - I won't bother making this again.

My main reason for rating this is to let you know this can be made the night before.  I used 3 small (7 oz?) tubes of biscuits, followed the recipe for the cinnamon & sugar coating, and left them in the bundt pan overnight in the fridge covered with plastic wrap.  In the morning, I made the caramel mixture (with a tsp. of vanilla as others suggested) and baked. They came out great!  This step saved me a lot of time in the morning as I needed them for our early morning bus stop party.

I used four 7.5 oz biscuit tubes. I used butter instead of margarine, after the sauce boiled for a minute, I added a tablespoon of vanilla then about 2-3 tablespoons of heavy cream, It turned out great!!

A wonderful treat! I had an extra tube of biscuit dough in the fridge, and was trying to decide what to make with it when I found this. I scaled the recipe down to five servings, but doubled the topping and poured it between layers. it all fit perfectly into my smaller loaf pan, which I think may have also helped it cook all the way through. My husband and I had to stop ourselves from eating the whole thing in one sitting!

I used the leftover cinnamon sugar (it came to 1/2 cup after shaking the biscuits) with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and boiled that with the butter on top of the stove.  It seemed a shame to waste the cinnamon sugar, and it turned out wonderfully.

I was really rooting for this recipe because it got such great reviews, but it was a disaster for me.  The middle didn't cook and I used a tube pan.  I had to cover it with tin foil about 15 minutes into cooking time because it was already starting to burn.  The brown sugar/buter mixture needs a much longer boiling time because it came out very granular instead of gooey.

Sinfully delicious!!!  Next time I will try taking it out a little sooner, as the top got a little crunchy in the oven.  ***UPDATE*** I made this again, using "flaky layers" biscuits and dark brown sugar instead of light.  It was heavenly!  Definitely use the layered biscuits!

Great recipe!  The only change I would make is to layer the pan with half of the biscuit quarters and pour a quarter of the brown sugar mix on top, then layer the rest of the pan and pour remaining brown sugar mixture.  I have gotten all rave reviews every time I make this recipe.

My family loved this. Did not have a bundt pan, so I used a loaf pan and cooked only one package of bisquit dough. It was the perfect amount for my family of 4. I was glad I only cooked one package, because we could have easily devoured more.

two stars for the recipe as is-  I tried it exactly as listed, using a bundt pan,  and ended up with a gloppy mess.  3 cans of biscuits is way to much for my bundt pan,  trying a second time with two cans worked much better. Addditionally the brown sugar/butter syrup is not sufficient for three cans of buscuits.  out of the pan, the top layer was almost burnt and dry,  the bottom was almost raw and soggy.  when I made the second time, I used two cans of biscuits, and poured half the butter/sugar on the first layer of dough,  and the balance on the second layer-  worked much better this way.

Maybe not a family favorite but pretty good. We don't put in the raisins or walnuts. My tips: use a bundt pan, cut the biscuits with a pizza cutter, cover with foil for about 20 minutes to avoid the top getting that slightly harder type crust, and carefully flip it out into a large bowl while it is still hot.

I only used one package of biscuits and cut the brown sugar butter serving in half. I also used a 9x9 pan which worked perfect.

I make this when the grandkids come over.  I do the cutting & boiling. I add nutmeg to the cinnamon mix. We make muffins.  I usually cut dough into 8 pieces.  The kids do the shake, shake shake & place the pieces into muffin tins.  When they go home they are so tickled with themselves. with a present for Mom & Dad. When making a large batch I use Rhodes froxen bread dough.

In response of not using a tube pan. Tube pans come in both two piece and one piece versions. One piece tube pans work just the same as a bundt pan. You will also find traditional bundt pans that are labels as tube pans on Amazon.com.

NOTE: not ALL tube pans are two-part. While I have used one-piece or two-piece tube pans, I am always cognizant to line the two-piece with parchment and cook it on a cookie sheet. Also be careful when using springform pans as even if they seem water-tight it may not be so.

So I put half a pack of (cook and serve) vanilla pudding in the bottom of the bundt pan and sprinkled the pecans on top of it -- before layering the sugar-coated biscuits, and I failed miserably! The biscuits at the bottom of the bundt pan did not cook, no matter how long I put it back in the oven for. Will follow the recipe word-for-word once more and hope it turns out alright!

Personally, I like more cinnamon. The sugar crust was a different take on how I usually make it, which is by rolling the biscuit pieces in melted butter and then in a cinnamon/brown sugar mix.

Super easy & yummy!  Made this for our family this morning for our grown sons & their wives and everyone enjoyed it.  I didn't add nuts or raisins as we have a few picky eaters.  Next time I will try nuts and craisins!

Yummy!  However, the inside pieces were doughy, so it could have used another 5 or 10 minutes, but I think that's just my oven as I frequently experience needing more time with other recipes.  I daresay this rivals my mom's homemade from scratch sticky buns without all the work.  I think that next time I'll bake it in a 9x13 pan as my family likes the outside pieces the best, and you get more outside pieces that way.  Honestly, the bad reviews, they must of done something wrong.  I don't see how this cannot turn out great.

I am not a huge walnut fan so I used pecans instead of walnuts and I put some on the bottom of the pan before I started to layer on the refrigerated biscuits.  The biscuits (I used Grands) pulled apart the best when you roll them into balls after cutting them into quarters.  Exceptionally yummy.  Made it the night before and I was a little worried that it would get too hard for brunch in the morning but it just flew!

I have been making Monkey Bread for years, Only I do it a little different.  1. instead of biscuit dough I use Pillsbury Cinnamon Roll Dough. 2. I don't use walnuts or raisins(personal preference) 3. I mix the brown sugar, sugar, and cinnamon together and mix in the cinnamon roll pieces then use the leftover mix to melt it in the butter after.  It comes out so good, my husbands favorite desert that I make by far.

I made this three different times because I was determined to make great monkey bread and by the other reviews, this was apparently a perfect recipe. When I followed the recipe as written it came out extremely dry.   It was better when I baked it at 325.  But the best results came when I used the cinnabon buscuit dough. By far, wayy better than the cinanmon sugar on regular buscuits. Unimaginably better. The regular recipe just tasted sweet but unmistakably like regular buscuits.

This recipe earned brownie points for me from my Mother-in-law! It's easy to make. I did make the mistake once of cutting the biscuits the night before and coating them in the cinnamon sugar mixture, hoping to save time the next morning. I had a soupy mess.

This was awesome! I got the Williams-Sonoma box mix a few years ago and loved it but it is so expensive and I don't even think they carry it anymore so I wanted to find out how to make it myself without a mix. I followed the recipe to a T except for the raisins. I got three tubes of butter flavored biscuits (HEB brand). I tore each one into 4 pieces and put 12 pieces of biscuit in the sugar mixture at a time. I used an angel food cake pan and did mine in layers. I put a tube of biscuit pieces in the bottom, sprinkled half the walnuts, put another tube of biscuit pieces, sprinkled the remaining walnuts and then the remaining tube of biscuit pieces. I pressed them down a bit to push the pieces together so they wouldn't seperate when I put it on my cake stand. Then I followed the rest including letting it sit for 10 minutes after baking. It tasted like fresh cinnamon rolls and there was none left over after brunch. Delish!

It's a great recipe, but if you're going to use a bundt pan make sure to only use two cans of dough. Mine did not cook all the way through, but what did cook was absolutely delicious.

The flavor of this monkey bread recipe is fantastic but absolutely use a bundt pan.  Also I've tweaked it by an additional 1/4 cup butter(margarine) and a 1/4 cup brown sugar to increase the amount of caramel.  I also pour half the caramel over the bread half way through placing the dough pieces in the pan and then pour the rest of the caramel over the top.  This is nice added touch and I've really found if I split the caramel the pieces are more evely covered when the finished product comes out of the oven.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!

 I tried this one morning for a playdate breakfast and everyone loved it.  Now I am automaticly nominated to bring monkey bread to every event! 

 I doubled the brown sugar & margarine mixture and used almost all of it. I also could not find a 12oz roll of biscuits so I used 3 10oz rolls.

 A few others mentioned this, and it's very true... you have to eat this right away.  This is not something you can prepared the night before.  I'd say it's at it's best about 30 minutes to 2 hours after being baked.  After that it gets a little hard.  If your family/friends are like mine though, it'll be gone before that happens!!

Excellent. I only use 1 container of biscuits when making this since our family is small.  (the Pillsbury Grand Biscuits).  I use 1/3 cup each of white and brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 cup melted butter. I also sprinkle chopped almonds on the bottom of the pan before placing the biscuit pieces on top. I then put it in a round 9 inch pan.  It's just as pretty versus doing it in a bundt pan.  A keeper.

5+++ I can't say enough about this. For Thanksgiving I was running short on time and I wanted to make homemade cinnamon rolls. So I got on this site and found this recipe. Ran to the store and got the biscuits and from there on easy as pie. Everyone faved about this and wants the recipe. (For christmas gifts I am typing this recipe up on fancy paper and putting it in a new bundt pan..so thanks for also making my gift giving easy..lol) Anyways the only thing I did do different was to only cut the biscuits in 1/2 instead of 4 pieces.

Used butter instead of margarine and pecans instead of walnuts. Took this to work for department breakfast and everyone LOVED it. Baked for 25 mins the night before then heated in oven for 15 minutes so that it would be nice and warm for breakfast. I will be making this again. FOR SURE. Wondering how it would be with dried cranberries (instead of raisins) or chopped dried apricots???

Absolutely divine!  I've made this several times.  You would never believe these were refrigerator biscuits.  :o)  I used 4 - 7oz cans of buttermilk biscuits, poured half the caramel sauce halfway through layering the biscuits, then poured the rest on top.  It seeps throughout and is delicious!  Thanks for a super recipe!  10 stars!!!

Mmmmmmmmmm SO good and SO easy!!  I made this recipe for my family and they loved it so much I've made it at least 5 or 6 times since.  We LOVE this recipe.  The only things I change is that I didn't use nuts, because I don't like the texture of nuts in breads.  And, I used 2 7.5 oz cans of biscuits.  And, even though I used the smaller cans I still had plenty of bread for everyone.  I would highly recommend this recipe for any monkey bread lovers like me.  :)  Oh yeah and THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!  IF YOU WANT THE SAUCE TO BE ALL THROUGH THE BREAD, AFTER YOU'VE FILLED YOUR PAN HALFWAY, POUR HALF OF THE SAUCE OVER THE BISCUITS.  THEN, FILL THE REST OF THE WAY AND POUR THE REST ON TOP!!!  YUMMY!!

Very yummy, rich and sweet.  I suggest cooking it a little longer than stated if you don't want it too doughy.  We used a pizza cutter for the dough and omitted the raisins and nuts.

Delicious and easy! I barely had to lift a finger, my four year old and two year old did all the work. :o) My tips- use kitchen shears to snip the biscuits, (the four year old's job!) it's much faster than a knife. If you don't have kitchen shears, use a pizza cutter on a flat counter. Zip, zip, zip. I also partialy froze a block of neufchatel (low fat cream cheese) for about 15 minutes (makes it easier for chopping with a sharp knife, less gooey mess) and chopped it into little cubes and sprinkled them into the pan after laying out each layer of buscuits (the two year old's job!) Yummy Sunday morning treat. :o)

This recipe is GREAT!  I would definitely recommed using a Bundt pan for this so it the liquids don't bubble over the sides of the pan.  I omitted the nuts and rasins and just added extra cinnamon and brown sugar to taste.  I also made a cinnamon roll type glaze to put over the top of them once they have been removed from the bundt pan and has cooled some.  This made it taste even more like bite size pieces of cinnamon rolls. It not only made an excellent dessert but a really good breakfast as well.  If you want it warm for the next day, just pop some in the microwave on a plate covered with a paper towel and heat for about 10-15 seconds or until warm.  MMMMMM!!!!

Very good recipe, I didn't have biscuits, I had one of those loaves of white bread from the freezier section, that you defrost and cook. I used that and it turned out really good, my five children ate it all. And then wanted more.

Recipe is awesome, quick and easy and loved by all!  A quick recommendation:  use a bundt pan and not an angel food tube pan.  (Tube in an angel food pan is taller than the top of the bread and when flipped out, the monkey bread does not come out in one piece because of the space gap between the top of the bread and the pan.)

This was the EASIEST recipe EVER!  The bread wasn't out of the oven 10 minutes and my other half was pulling at it. FYI - be sure to layer the sauce in between the dough.  otherwise you'll have dry spots.  Good Luck!

This recipe was awesome!!  I never tried monkey bread before but this turned out pretty much exactly as I had hoped.  Next time I make it I will layer in the sugar/butter mix as I mound up the dough rather than pouring it all at the end on top.  Also, as a previous reviewer said, I had to bake it almost twice the time for it to be done and it was a bit cumbersome to have to turn it out in order to find out...but now I will know for next time.  All in all, really tasty and everyone loved it!

Yum!  Here's a  variation of this recipe called Gorilla Bread, a small pinch of cream cheese is added in the middle of the ball of dough.  It makes it taste almost like a cinnabun.  Either way, this is really good!

Delicious and super easy.  Tons of leftovers, you may want to half the recipe, I made it in a bundt pan and it filled the whole thing.  I wrapped the leftovers in foil and left it out over night, popped it in the oven the next morning and it tasted just as good.

I've made this several times and it is one of my family's favorites.  I usually don't worry about the raisins and I use a bundt pan too.  I have tried making it up the night before to save time in the morning, but it doesn't turn out as well that way.

I absolutely love this recipe. I find it works best in a bundt pan - less chance of spilling over. I also like to mix the sugar in a bowl instead of a bag - it's less mess and easier for my daughter to help. Try pouring the brown sugar and butter mixture throughout as you layer that way all pieces get coated evenly. This one is a definite keeper. Thanks LuAnn!!

I'm a home daycare provider and the kids and I made this yesterday.  I was really impressed. After reading other revue I was a little nervous
to use tube pan, worked great in bundt pan that I sprayed really well. The kids loved it.

This was very easy to do. I was always afraid to try monkeybread because all the recipes I saw required making the dough from scratch. I never thought about just buying refrigerated dough from the grocery store. The monkeybread came out excellent.

The taste was great, but pouring the sauce over it made all the sauce sink to the bottom.  After it cooled the top of the bread was too chewy to eat.  My father used to make it and he would dip each piece into the butter and cinnamon/sugar.  I think it might come out better that way.

First: I don’t understand why people don’t put a baking sheet under their pan so it doesn’t leak all over the oven. It’s common sense and not a reason to take off stars. That being said...the recipe is WONDERFUL! I changed the method, as I have always made monkey bread this way: quarter the biscuits, dip them in the melted butter, coat in the cinnamon sugar then place them in the Bundt. That way it ensures there are no dry pieces.

Use a bundt pan..one piece, I think that's what they mean when they say tube pan..I love this recipe but I do skip a lot of steps. I put both sugars in a bowl with cinnamon(and I use a lot more cinnamon than the suggested amount.  Break apart the biscuits and coat with the sugars, and put it evenly in the bundt pan.melt the margarine or butter in the microwave for a minute and pour on top..baking time is the same. It comes out perfect everytime.

I also made some changes.  I used frozen dinner roll dough instead of biscuits (16 balls of dough, thawed and cut into quarters & let rise for 30 min in warm oven.  Then I used half the sugar & cinnamon, and half the brown sugar, but used a full cube of butter.  I also used chopped pecans and no raisins - don't like raisins!  It was delicious!!!

I had monkey bread once in my life and it was 7 years ago. My husband loves it but it was always not something that pops in my mind to make. Yesterday I found this recipe and I thought I'll give it a try. It took me a trip to three different supermarkets to find the biscuit dough but I finally got it and ran home to start my experiment. I did the following modifications though; used 2 containers of the dough, and increased the brown sugar/ butter sauce amount. My bread came out fantastic, and I must say, most of it was gone by just the two of us and a guest. Things I'll do differently next time; use less time in the oven because the sugar sauce started crystallizing and getting hard, and I won't add raisins, just discovered hubby doesn't like them that much. The recipe was phenomenal and easy to make, and the whole house smelled of sweet baking.

Used 1 can of biscuits and divided the recipe to 1/3.  Used an 8" cake pan and it still overflowed in my oven and filled the oven with burnt sugar smoke.  Baked for 20 mins which was perfect.  It was very delicious.  Will definitely make again, just need to adjust the size of the pan so it does not overflow.

And according to the instructions... and common sense... using a A SOLID BOTTOM PAN... SUCH AS A SOLID TUBE OR BUNDT PAN.. THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ANGEL FOOD PAN, SPRING FORM PAN, AND OTHER REMOVABLE BOTTOM PANS... WITH THE LIQUID IN THIS RECIPE IT KINDA FOLLOWS THAT IT WILL LEAK IF THERE IS ANY OPENING IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN. Sorry if this offends anyone but I could not understand why everyone said not to use a bundt pan when the only bundt pans I can find are all solid...

Loved this recipe.  I have made it with the 3 can of biscuits and also with just one.  There are just two of us and it tends to be just alittle too much for two.  
For the one 16 oz can recipe I used a 7" x 3-1/2 " tall Pyrex glass bowl /  and everything else I cut into half.  Turned out great.  Thanks LuAnn

Used the grands (2 cans) but didn't cut them up..stood them on end instead so an angelfood cake pan can be used with no boil over.  The carmel sauce gets between each one just fine. No raisins, nuts or frosting. Sweet enough.

I have made other monkey breads in the past and they were all dry so I was hesitent to try this but I did and it was great! I did add a little extra topping (butter and brown sugar) because I was afraid it was going to be dry. We will making this one again!!

Delicious!  I only used 2 cans of biscuits (the ones that have 8 biscuits) and it was PERFECT.  Any more would not have fit in my bundt pan.  I used butter, not margarine.  I filled the pan halfway and poured some of the butter/sugar mixture over it, along with some nuts.  And then poured the rest on top.

The bread tasted great but didn't turn out like I wanted it to. I made this for Christmas morning brunch and was a little disappointed. I think the biscuit dough was too dense and thick. I'd like to try it again with a different kind of dough, maybe more like bread dough. I didn't have a tube pan so I used a regular bread pan and the middle didn't cook through. So I dumped it out onto a baking sheet to cook the rest of the dough, which it did but in the meantime, cooked the sauce too much, which crystalized too fast and was hard to eat. I will try again but with some modifications.

My Mom made us monkey bread as kids, but has since passed away and I don't have her recipe. I was trying to find one that is close and this was it. It isn't exactly the one she made for us, but it was close and my 3 and 6 year old girls had fun helping me. I think the one my Mom made had us dip each piece in butter and then the cinnamon/sugar mix so the top wasn't all gooey. I may attempt to do it that way next time, but the flavor was still yummy. Thank you

Used real butter instead of margarine in these, which made the flavor, I think.  Didn't use nuts or raisins.  Only used 2 packages of the biscuits and was plenty for my tube pan.  Turned out very good and grandkids liked them, which is saying a lot.  Will make again for sure.

Sooooooo good! I felt like I was messing it up as I made it. It just didn't feel right pouring the sugar mixture on top of the dough, but it turned out great!

I've made Monkey Bread before and it seems kind of dry but not this one!  I love that you pour that hot glaze over the top before you bake it.  
Like some of the other reviews said I made 1/3 of the recipe and baked it in an 8" cake pan and turned it over on a plate as soon as it came out of the oven, that way all the syrup at the bottom sat on top and soaked back in.
I also didn't have brown sugar for the glaze but since I'm 8 months pregnant I had to have them NOW so I used maple syrup in place of the brown sugar and it was delicious!

5 star review! Very easy recipe to follow and assemble.  I used a silicone bundt pan to bake my bread - as the notes showed that an angel food cake pan was dangerous.

In place of the walnuts I used 1/4 c. dried apples and 1/4 c. dried cranberries. I went with a Jumbo Raisin mix as opposed to regular raisins. So yummy! My guys have requested that this be made again.

This is a great recipe. It is a little time consuming but it is really tasty. I've used either butterscotch or vanilla pudding and it works out wonderfully.

Made this with a two piece pan and simply put a cookie sheet on the rack underneath this.  I let it sit for a few minutes after so I wouldn't spill hot butter on myself.  It was great but i might cook it a little longer next time...the inner core was very undercooked!

great recipe.  This is on our Christmas morning menu.  We add a block of cream cheese (cut in about 20 cubes), wrapped inside the biscuits, then sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Fantastic touch.

I've made this once as directed, and once at 1/3 recipe in a round cake pan.  Both were excellent!!!!!  Next time I will try putting some of the butter/brown sugar mixture in the middle, and the top, just to see how that turns out.

This is a great and simple recipe.  I made only 1/3 of the recipe and used an 8in cake pan and it turned out great.  I did make extra caramel and poured it over the bread after I flipped it onto a plate.  It would be the perfect amount for a family of 4.

I don't cut the biscuits.  Just kind of smash them out a little, put some of the sugar/cinnamon mixture in the middle and roll it or wad it up and put it in the pan.  I always have to make 2 BUNDT pans full because everyone comes a running.  I use 1 stick of butter and 1 C. of brown sugar for the sauce.

AMAZING!!!! Although I didn't have a beautiful bundt pan =( I still managed to have the same yummylicious taste that everyone else experienced.. I used a 9x13 baking pan, and it came out great! I used a homemade biscuit dough recipe because all the recipes I checked all had storebought packaged biscuit dough! Not very authentic, if you ask me. Anyway, the baking soda in the biscuit dough really helped the monkey bread. Each individual piece of the biscuit dough expanded and stuck to each other (just the way you want it). =)

Definitely DO NOT use a tube pan; you will have an oozey mess!    This is so delicious and easy.  Every time I make this for my family or for company it disappears quickly.  It is a favorite for sure!

I used this recipe to make large monkey bread muffins and they were wonderful. I changed some of the measurements and didn't use the nuts, just raisins and then drizzled confectioners sugar icing over them. They were so-o-o good.....

This is a family favorite! I use a 10 inch bundt pan and add one more can of biscuits. I use a little less white sugar and add more cinnamon. Otherwise, the same! We make this for Christmas morning and have found that it is ok to prepare through step 2 and cover and refrigerate the night before. The next morning I finish the recipe...needed to cook a few minutes longer. Still turned out great and saved time.

Loved this bread!  Fun and easy to make and fun to share.  I used a bundt pan, and the 3 (12oz) pkgs of biscuits and didn't have any problems with it overflowing or mess.  On the sauce after it finished boiling, I added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I served this Christmas morning and I couldn't keep my oldest daughter away from it.  She was eating it out of the pan before I could flip it onto a serving plate.  I'm ready to make this again!

Delicious!!!!!  Definitely use a bundt pan.  DO NOT stir the margarine/brown sugar mixture once it comes to a boil - get it to a full rolling boil and then time it for a minute, for those who are having a problem with it separating.  Will be making this for Christmas breakfast every year at the request of the family.  And for the skeptics out there, you'd never know it had "canned" biscuits in it.  :)

I made this recipe for breakfast this morning for my daughter and her sleep-over pals, and it was definitely a hit!!  I used four cans of generic biscuits, and like some other reviewers had suggested, I doubled the butter and brown sugar mixture.  I then put a layer of the cinnamon-sugar coated biscuit pieces in a bundt pan sprayed with non-stick spray, and after each single layer I drizzled the brown sugar/butter mixture and sprinkled lightly with toasted chopped almonds (that is all that I had on-hand). The final layer was about 2/3 from the top of the pan.  I had previously placed a cookie sheet on the bottom rack of my oven (to catch any spills) and I then placed the bundt pan on the middle rack above.  I can happily say that the bread rosed nicely to within an inch of the top of the pan, and I had no drips at all!!  After I took the bread out of the oven, I let it sit in the pan for about 5 minutes, then flipped it out onto a pizza pan and keep the bundt pan in place upside down for another 5 minutes (just to let all the carmel mixture run back thru the bread). It unmolded fantastic with no sticking.  All the bread pieces where tender and well-coated.  No burnt spots or dryness at all.  Give these a try.....they are truly heavenly!!

Hi Everyone!  Love this recipe, and I wanted to share that I cook it in a traditional 9x12 pan.  We like it this way for several reasons:  more crunchy coated biscuits (more surface area) and no fears about uncooked (too raw/gooey) middle sections.  No debate over tube or bundt, either.    Everyone I have ever made this for requests that I make it- it's ALWAYS a hit.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!  It is amazing.  I added dry butterscotch pudding to my sugar mix and OMG I cannot believe how amazingly wonderful this is...  I didn't change anything else on the recipe.

I had some biscuits I needed to use up, which led me to this recipe....YUMMY! I used 4 cans (7.5 oz each) of biscuits and cut them in half - worked great!

Delicious! I've made this several times and people literally fight over it!!  I used Pillsbury Grand biscuits with honey and sprinkled raisins and chopped pecans throughout dough. Poured 1/2 of the sauce over the first 1/2 of biscuits, added the remaining biscuits and poured the other 1/2 of sauce to make sure sauce was spread throughout. I always bake for exactly 35 minutes and comes out PERFECT!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I love monkey bread, so I've tried several variations. Try flattening the biscuits a little, and wrapping them around clusters of blueberries, cooked apples, or (our favorite) a cube of cream cheese. YUM!!!

The outside was too dark and crunchy.  I think I will use 2 tubes of biscuits instead of 3 next time because it takes too long for the inside to cook.

searched for awhile but this is the monkey cake i love.  I use cinn. rolls instead of the buscuits and omit the cinn. and sugar.  I did pour the butter mixture half way through along with the raisins and the nuts I used walnuts before now going to try pecans.  the family loves it and it's really easy my kids could do it with out my help.  Thanks for the recipe

An awesome bread - my husband and kids ask for this all the time now!  One thing I would recommend, is mixing the brown sugar/butter mix earlier and putting half in the middle.  So layer the first half on the bottom of the pan, drizzle some of the mixture in the middle and finish the rest of the dough chunks.  This helps the bread come out really gooey and yummy!!

I saw an episode of Unwrapped where they showed how monkey bread was made. So I came on here to find a recipe and used this one. I don't have a tube or bundt pan so I used two loaf pans. I skipped the raisins (Not a fan of wrinkly fruit)and used some chopped, lightly salted pecans. WOW! For such a simple recipe it really tastes great!!! I figured the biscuit flavor would be overpowering and easily recognizable as "canned" but it wasn't! I will definately make this again!

Never have made this before, but it was a HUGE hit!!!  Added nuts and rasins, used a bundt pan and placed that in a cookie sheet to bake incase there would be any spill over.  My kids have a new favorite and it is so easy to make!

Absolutely Delicious Recipe! I was able to put four 7.5 oz buttermilk biscuit tubes worth of cut biscuit pieces in my 10 inch Bundt pan. That filled it 3/4 full. It rose just a tad bit above the top with no spillover. The recipe was PERFECT! I am so pleased with this. The only thing I did different is used butter instead of margarine. I just don't like margarine or trans fat or the flavor. 35 minutes at 350 was perfect. I sprayed the inside of the pan with original Pam and it slid right out after cooling about 8 or 9 minutes. Thank you soo much for this recipe. It's recipes like this that makes this old single dad quite popular amongst my daughter's friends. I'll post a picture!

I made this with only a few changes.  I took some of the other suggestions.  I used 4 cans of Walmart Buttermilk Biscuits.  I made 1 1/2 times the amount of glaze adding 1tsp vanilla.  I baked it about 35 minutes in a bundt pan and turned it out on to a plate immediately.  It was PERFECT!!!.  My family loved it so much, they couldn't stop eating it.  Monkey Bread was one of my Husband's favorite childhood treats.  I have never made it before, nor did I tell him I was going to make it.  When he saw it, it was so perfect, he thought I bought it at a store.  He couldn't believe I had made it.  I will definetly make it again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a fun treat for our guest that came to visit. I had my doubts about Monkey Bread in general, as I've never tried it - only heard of it. However, this was an easy and fun dessert/bread to make. I followed the recipe to the "T" and should I ever decided to make it again, I'll do so just the same. Clear and simple directions. I used a Bundt pan, rather than tube. Seemed to work just fine.

I really wanted to give this a 5-star, but it was SO SWEET.  I think that I will put 1/2 of the butter/brown sugar topping on it next time.  And trust me, I love sweet and this was too much for me.

This is a simple and easy recipe with minimal ingredients that tastes like a cinnamon roll fresh from the bakery!  I took the advice from the previous reviewers and did a single layer of biscuits, then a layer of sauce, then a second layer of biscuits, finished with a layer of sauce on top.  I also flipped it upside down immediately after removing from the oven.  I can't wait to make this again!

I follwed the directions exactly and cooked it for the time stated, but when I flipped the pan over all the liquid came pouring out and the entire thing was raw!!  I flipped it back into the pan and cooked it for another 30 minutes, but the very center was still raw when I cut into it.  It didn't taste anything like the monkey bread I've had in the past.  I will try a different recipe.

we try to stay away from the preservatives found in refrigerator dough, so instead we made a double batch of biscuit dough and cut that with a pizza cutter to appropriate sized chunks:)

I gave this 5 stars because of the raves of my family.  I would give it 4 stars for my opinion, a little greasy w/the butter.  I'll try the lechitin tip next time I think.  I made it originally in a tube pan.  All I can say to you is DON'T (IMHO).  What a mess.  Had to clean the oven twice.  I made it in a 9x14 this time and it fit full recipe and no mess!  Family loves it.  Only changes are: 9x13 pan, butter for margarine, a little vanilla to sauce, and pecans instead of walnuts.  Little tweak to our preferences.  Thanks for the recipe.

A great recipe! I have never made this without people raving about it, and that goes for kids as well as adults!  
I made the following changes, and it was still fantastic: I added cinnamon to the butter/brown sugar mixture that was poured over it, and left out the nuts and raisins.  This is always a hit--thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is great! Since I live alone, I adjusted the recipe cutting everything in half.  Afterwards I cooked in it mini loaf pans.  It came out great and each mini pan had just enough for one or two people.

I don't eat monkey bread but my family loved this.  Their only suggestion was that i dip each piece of dough in the melted mixture before placing it in the pan so that each piece is completely covered.

Really good flavor and so easy to make. But best eaten warm, they toughen up too much when cool.

My first encounter with monkey bread was at a dinner potluck. After the first bite, I basically camped out next to the bread and tried to discreetly shove the rest of it into my mouth while positioning my body so others couldn't get to it. It's really that good. I made it the next week for a brunch I was attending - this recipe looked closest to the one I had devoured. I don't make alot of cakes, etc, so I wasn't really interested in buying a tube pan. I used one of those disposable deep 9 inch rounds one can buy at the local supermarket. I was a little concerned because it wasn't a bundt or tube pan, but it came out PERFECT and I spent another social event making sure that all conversation occured within reaching distance of the monkey bread. Just remember to only fill the pan 3/4 of the way - the biscuits expand. Also, you want to make it the day you are going to eat it. It's best served warm and gooey.

This recipe is so good.  It's still tasty a week later, if you put in the fridge/freezer.  I reheated it for 30 seconds, 7 days after I made it, and it was still delicious.  I will make this again for sure.

Just made this "cake" for the first time in years. I had lost my recipe and used this one. It is wonderful...even better if you drizzle top with cinnamon roll icing!

My 6-year-old made this for a talent contest at church and had so much fun.  When we turned it out of the pan onto the plate it was all we could do to keep from digging in.  It looked so nice on the plate.  She also made the cream cheese frosting from "clone of a cinnabon" for dipping.  Needless to say...she got a 10.

Really easy and great tasting too. I used pecans instead of walnuts, no raisins, and used a pizza cutter to cut up biscuits.

This recipe is a favorite of my nieces 7 year-old Deimani and 5 year-old Arianna because they can help make it and they love eating the Monkey Bread with their hands. It has become one of our favorite fun things to do together. The only thing we've done differently is we sprinkle cinnamon sugar between the layers of rolled dough and we use the remaining cinnamon sugar plus brown sugar instead of just the brown sugar. Oh, and we omit the "yucky" raisins and use just nuts. 
Thank you for this recipe we will enjoy it for years to come.

I made this recipe for my family.  We have used a different recipe for years that sat in the oven overnight rising, but we often ended up with burnt sugar.  This reciped doesn't end up with this problem because you carmelize the sugar into a syrup first - for some reason this keeps it from being a problem.  We really enjoyed it, and it is nice to find another thing to use ref. biscuits for.

OH MY GOSH! Is this great or what!  I've been so hungry for Monkey Bread and even went to a couple of local fairs, but alas they were either not open, or not there :(  This recipe filled the bill and more.  I will definitely make again and again.  Thank you for sharing it with us.

Yummy.   I wanted to make this but did not have white sugar, so I used brown instead. Although I think this could be really awesome it was a bit too sweet and the the sugar did not dissolve, it was grainy. Once we got into the middle some of the dough was raw. Next time I will bake a little longer and make sure to use white not brown sugar. I did not have a problem w/ sticking, I flipped it right out of the oven. I also glazed it w/ cream cheese glaze.  I think even if you coat every other piece it would still be sweet enough. My son and husband loved it and it tasted like one of those famous cinnamon buns you get in the mall. Warning... do not make this if you are on a diet, it's too hard to resist. After a month w/out sugar, I totally caved. Looking forward to making it again correctly and maybe w/ cream cheese in the middle of the dough.

This was such a neat recipe!  I used finely chopped pecans and omitted the raisins.  I will take the suggestion of another reviewer next time and use buttermilk biscuits, as this was a tad dry.  I will also pour the sauce between the layers. Excellent with coffee!

It was great, but next time will use a little less sugar. I also dipped each piece in the melted butter before dipping in sugar mixture. Turned out better that way.

I have made this recipe many, many times.  But instead of using a tube pan I use a bundt cake pan because the biscuits get thoroughly cooked as opposed to the tube pan.  So if anyone makes this recipe, use a bundt cake pan instead.  Other than that, this is an awesome snack and a great substitute for a birthday cake.  I made one for my neighbors birthday and they LOVED it!!!

This was great.  The only thing I did differently was that I dipped the biscuits in the brown sugar/butter liquid before dipping them in cinnamon/sugar.  I then poured the remaining liquid ontop.  I highly recommend these.

I used the big biscuits and they took at least 15 more minutes to bake than the recipe says. I baked them for half an hour and the ones in the middle were still raw. I put them back in the oven for 15 minutes and they were perfect. I also shook the pieces with both the brown and white sugar and cinnamon. I then melted the excess left over mix with the margarine. Worked out well.

GREAT recipe!  Made it for "treat day" at work and it was a hit with everyone.  I sprinkled some of the left over cinnamon and sugar on it and added the sauce to it in layers for extra saturation.  Also added vanilla to the brown sugar/margarine mixture.  Yummy - will definately make again and again!

If you want a real scrumptious treat, flatten out the pieces of biscuit and wrap them around a cube of cream cheese, before you toss them in the cinnamon and sugar.  WOW!

This recipe is incredible and so easy to make!  I used my Bundt pan and 2 cans of Grands buttermilk biscuits.  I cut the biscuits into 6ths instead of 4ths and it cooked for the same time as regular biscuits.  I also added some vanilla extract to the butter/sugar topping and made the sauce in the microwave instead of on the stovetop.

I found shaking the cinnamon/sugar with the biscuit pieces to be really easy and even a little fun, as it brought out a little of the kid in me. :)

Absolutely delicious!

the second time I made the bread i used a bundt pan. in my first attempt to make the monkey bread i set my oven on fire and had to call the fire dept. I didn't realize that the butter and sugar mixture leaked out of the tube pan (it's a two piece)and most of it was on the bottom tray of the oven. the oven was hot so i figured it was a good time to clean the oven. i have a gas self-cleaner. i was out on my patio enjoying reading when i smelled something burning. when i went into the kitchen the flames were a foot high in the oven and the smoke was pouring out of it. i couldn't open the oven door because it was in the lock mode. we called the fire dept but by the time they came the fire burned itself out. i was very lucky i didn't ruin my oven and there wasn't more damage done. so please be careful when you make this in a two piece tube pan. if it does leak clean the bottom tray before self cleaning or better yet place a piece of foil on the bottom. i learned that the hard way.

Oh yes, this one's a keeper.  I used a bundt pan and filled it 2/3rds as others suggested; it worked out perfectly.  I also found another easy way to cut the biscuits into quarters - kitchen shears.

This was a great recipe and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  The only thing I did different was to double the margerine and brown sugar so it gave it more of a caramel glaze on it.

I made this today. First of all, I don't have a tube pan so I put them in an 8" cake pan. I didn't have enough room to use all 3 biscuit tubes, only 1 1/2. I left out the walnuts and raisens as I am not fond of them. I overcooked it a little but otherwise it turned out ok.  I will make it again after fine tuning a bit.

My 3 y/o daughter enjoyed helping me coat the peices with the cinnamin/sugar mixture.

I make this every now & again.  I love it!  It's just so easy!  Made it for co-workers this time.  I think it was only on the table for 20 minutes before it was all gone (& that's because no one knew it was over there).  Guess I should have made 2 this year!

I did not use a bundt cake pan just because I didn't want to.  It's Christmas and I wanted to use one of my pretty red Temptation cookware pieces.  Worked just as well & was pretty on our Christmas table.  Grands flaky butter biscuits were on sale, so I used 2 - 16.9 oz cans instead of the 3 - 12 ounce cans.  Left out the nuts & raisins.  Used butter instead of margarine (cause it just tastes better).  No other changes to the recipe.

My first time making Monkey Bread and I made no changes other than omitting any nuts and using a 1/2 cup of golden raisins. I may add one diced apple next time for fun but I only made this a couple hours ago and my family hasn't stopped pulling pieces of it apart since. And one melted some cream cheese icing on a piece and said that was amazing. This was a very easy recipe to follow. Thank you so much for an amazing recipe that I will definitely be making again and again.

This was an easy recipe. I'm 16 and it turned out perfect, so I'm confident anyone can make this. I followed the recipe pretty much, except for 1 or 2 things. I used a dark bundt pan and 2 (16.3oz) cans of Pillsbury biscuits and cut them in quarters, and in the cinnamon mixture, I added a pinch of salt because my mom always says to add more salt, or a pinch if it's not called for. When I boiled the brown sugar and butter, I added a tsp of vanilla. After the bread baked for 35 min @ 350 degrees, my mom helped me flip it right away so the brown sugar would seep through the biscuits. The middle didn't look quite done, so we baked it on a cookie sheet, not the bundt pan so the middle would cook directly, for 5 minutes. Afterwards, everything was fine. It turned out really good and my mom and sister loved it. It's a little too sweet for me, but my mom and sister think it's perfect. I was skeptical about this recipe, but I'm glad I tried it. I love baking, and I've made 3 things from this site and they've all turned out well. I would've took a picture, but no phone at the moment. Thanks for reading my review :)

This was the first time I had made Monkey Bread. Thanks so much , LuAnn, for this wonderful recipe! It turned out beautifully, and I have no doubt that it will be a family favorite for many years. I used a larger Bundt pan, and had no problems at all

Thanks again

Ok, honestly I didn't make this version of monkey bread just because I don't like any thing that comes in a can, and usually make things from scratch. I'm not putting anyone down or anything. That's just my personal preference so please don't take that as a personal cut. But I gave this recipe a 5 star cuz I almost thought my mother wrote it. My name is Leah, and my most favorite thing to do when I was little was make monkey bread with my mom! I gave this recipe a five-star rating just cuz I think monkey bread bread is the best, and whether you make it from scratch, or from a can, or box, or bag just make it! Make it with your children, and let them act like monkeys while they cut the pieces of dough out with fun shaped cookie cutters, and stick them together in silly sweet happy fun awesome ways! And please remember to add the 3 most important ingredients; that is to sing the song "Monkey Around" even if you don't know the words, Lots Of Love (LOL), and FUN (which, as a side note, may also lead to uncontrollable LOL and LOL)  ;-)  :-D !

This recipe is amazing! I love it and I think that everyone should try it. In my opinion it is better if you add another half cup of packed brown sugar. We enjoy this recipe on Sunday mornings before we go the church! TRY IT!!!

This was a wonderful recipe! I will say though that I only used 2 packages of the biscuits (grands) and that was more than enough. I was nervous about the the caramel sauce over flowing and burning in my oven,but it turned out just fine. As other reviewers said, be mindful how full the pan is before baking. 2/3 full for a bundt pan is about right. The pizza cutter is also a great idea for cutting up the dough! Will absolutely make this again.

Just made this and enjoying it this very second! Used my bundt pan and 4 1/2 (7.5oz) cans of bisquit dough. Perfect amount. I used about 1 1/4 sticks of butter (instead of margarine) and a little extra brown sugar than called for. My oven is powerful so baked at 325 degrees for 25 minutes was good. Kids requested no nuts so we left them out. Next time I think I will add some cream cheese and make it Gorilla bread. Perfect breakfast for a no school, blizzard kinda day!

Made this several times. I cannot make it too often because it is too good! The biscuits make little pieces of cinnamon rolls basically, and the sugars go to the bottom of the pan so when you flip it over it makes a sauce on top. Eat it hot, too, that's the best way. I am a lover of pecans, walnuts, etc and while they are really good in here, be careful not to overdo it and layer them with the biscuits. Delicious!

Delicious, my husband loves it. I would suggest covering it as it bakes as the top of mine got overcooked and dry. Also I added a half tsp of banana extract to the syrup and banana pieces in the layers to give it a hint of banana.. Hey it's MONKEY bread, isn't it?  :)

I used this recipe but I altered it. Before tossing the biscuit pieces around in the sugar and cinnamon, I wrapped the biscuit piece around a chunk of cream cheese. If you like cream cheese, try it, so good. I also tried it with little caramel candies, great flavor. But the cream cheese is better imo. :)

I use a bunt pan for this recipe, it is fantastic! I also just microwave the butter and brown sugar in a glass measuring cup instead of using a stove top. Perfect for family gatherings. Everyone munches on it and it's gone in about 20 minutes ??

I doubled the sauce . Used 3 pks of biscuits per bundt pan ( the ones that come in a small 4 pack ) . I alternated  sugared biscuit pieces / with the sauce / and some pecan pieces / and I chopped up a medium apple - put those pieces in too :) . One I made with fruit and nuts the other plain .  Both were AMAZING . Cooked up
Perfect . 35 min at 350 .out of oven I tipped each over on a plate :) this is the best monkey bread recipe ever . The night before I mixed up sugar /and cinnamon in big ziplock . Left it on counter . I also combined brown sugar and butter ( I used 1/2 stick of extra butter ) . Left that on pan uncooked / to save a few min in the am .... Perfect recipe !!!!!!!??????????

My family loves this recipe. I don't change anything and it comes out perfectly. Have made this several times and the last time I brought some to my 103 yr old great-grandmother whose response was, "OMG this is amazing!" I'm pretty sure she had dessert for dinner that night.

This was such a great result for the brunch I made for Mothers Day. Everyone loved it. I added a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla to the stovetop Carmel mixture and baked 10 min longer. Turned out perfect. Really Delicious.

I make this over and over again.  I have a high schooler with lots of friends! I don't use the store bought biscuits. I use a yeast roll recipe and make the dough in my bread machine.  I pull it and roll into balls.  It's so much cheaper!  Usually I always have the ingredients in the house and can make them anytime!

Have used this recipe many times.  Easy and is always good! I use 1 can of Grands and keep a cinnamon & sugar mixture, so I use much less white sugar.  No raisins for me, but I do use butter not margarine.

Best recipe for monkey bread :) I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it. I used four small cans of biscuits to fill a bundt pan, but i didn't include any walnuts or raisins. It was better plain

Delicious! Get it out of the pan before it completely cools and the sauce sticks.

Loved the monkey bread.  Easy to make and fun to eat.  Used two Grands biscuits cans. It looked beautiful when it came out of the bundt pan and on the plate.

I used a bundt pan for this recipe.  For the icing, I added an extra cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 3/4 cup butter (I don't like margarine) and added a 1/2 cup of Bacardi gold (this amount covered the 3 cans of biscuits perfectly). To the sugar and cinnamon mix, I added a tsp of nutmeg and a box of butterscotch jello pudding. I used sliced almonds and left out the raisins. Tip: Using a whisk to stir the icing made it nice and smooth. Bake on the top rack & you may want to place a cookie sheet (or foil) on the bottom rack to catch any drippings to cut down on clean up time. It was delicious! Thanks for sharing.

This was very good! I don't understand what the problem with tube pans are....there was no problem. A few reviewers mentioned a problem, but it sounded like they used a springform pan that has a bottom that removes, so the syrup might leak. A tube pan is a one piece pan that you usually make angel food cake in. Try the recipe again!

I used butter the first time I made this, and it did not turn out so great.  The second time I actually followed the recipe and it was perfection!  This recipe makes a gooey soft bread with a perfect sweetness.  It was a big hit with my kids.

This was delicious! I used some homemade Buttermilk Biscuit Batter instead, and still came out just great! The only thing that I would to be make a little bit more gaze for it; I ran out. I also used the leftover sugar/cinnamon mix to make French Toast.

I love this.  I put them in small ramekins and they took about 15 minutes to cook.  Individual servings for each kid.  I think I needed to add a little more butter since it was split up so much.  Delicious!

You'd think my husband and kids hadn't eaten in days, the way they inhaled this.  I liked it, too, although I only got a bite or two.  :-(  As I was dutifully cutting the Grands in quarters, then shaking them in the sugar/cinnamon mixture, I did think "there's gotta be a better way,"  .... but I think it will go more quickly next time, now that I have the hang of it.  Makes a beautiful, enticing presentation.

Wonderful! I made this with my fiance, it was easy and fun to make. We just put the pieces into a 1.5 quart baking dish because we don't have a bunt pan. It turned out so yummy. I only baked it for 30 minutes and then as some of the reviews had suggested I dumped it only after being cooled for a couple minutes. Then we ate almost half of it... We will definatly make this again. :)

This is simply a wonderful little recipe and have used a variation on this for years.  This recipe, however is my favorite.  The only thing I do differently is drizzle a little of the brown sugar sauce/caramel over each layer of biscuits, instead of pouring it on at the end.  My children are adults now, but still ask for this when we go to the beach each summer.  Good memories.  Thank you for sharing this little gem of a recipe.

I am currently making my zillionith Monkey Bread using this as a base.  I work at a boarding school and this is, by far, the most common request for a late-night "feed".  I thought it only fair that I rate this recipe finally!  It's a little time consuming, but fresh out of the oven, only-slightly-cooled monkey bread is pure awesomeness.  I do not bother with walnuts or raisins -- I add chocolate chips instead.  And I am not a huge fan of fridge biscuit dough, but am too lazy to make my own.  People have asked me for the recipe, is it wrong that I feel like it's my own secret deliciousness?  ; )  Enjoy!!

I turned these into muffins for two reasons: 1.) I don't have a Bundt Pan, and 2.) I only had one tube of dough. I added the chopped walnuts and raisins to the top of the muffins instead of incorporating them in. These were so easy, my 3 year old was able to help. I didn't use all of the butter/brown sugar mixture because I was concerned it would be overly sweet, but I would probably add more next time. Otherwise, my daughter and I each had two muffins (one roll of dough made 12 muffins) within 10 minutes of pulling them out of the oven! I cooked them at 350 for 12-14 minutes and they were perfect. Crescent dough would be good for this recipe too.

Hands down this is the best monkey bread recipe!! The only thing I changed was to use butter instead of margarine. I skipped the raisins and nuts (family doesn't care for them) and used a Bundt pan. Perfect!

This is so fun and easy to make. I tossed the biscuit pieces in a bowl instead of a bag. Also you can cut the white sugar and cinnamon mixture by half because you really don't need that much to coat them. So so so easy and looks good and taste good too!

Easy and delicious.  I made a few modifications based on others comments:
2 cans of jumbo buttermilk biscuits, real butter, splenda instead of sugar, and no nuts or raisins.  I found a steak knife cute through the piles of raw biscuits with no trouble.  The coating powder is more than you need if you use the two jumbo biscuit cans, you can cut it to 3/4 cup sugar/splenda.  Shaking the biscuit quarters in the bag worked fine, they were totally coated.  I increased the baking time to 45 and only a couple of pieces in the middle were slightly undercooked.

Delicious!  I made this recipe for breakfast on Christmas morning for my husband and me.  We both thought the recipe was yummy!  Because it was just the two of us, I only used 1 tube of biscuits and halved all of the other ingredients.  I put it in a 9 inch round cake pan.  I also recommend putting a cookie sheet underneath of your baking pan (especially if using a shallow pan) in case it overflows a little like mine did.  Excellent recipe...will definitely make again!

It's Fun to make and something that you can have the kids help with. This thing rises so do use a bundt pan or something with high sides. Otherwise you could end up with a mess in the oven.

I literally just made this monkey bread (using rhodes frozen yeast rolls) and all I can say is OMG it was great!  Everyone loved it.  I did it a little different...I mixed all the dry seasonings first and melted the butter (real butter) in a seperate bowl. Then I buttered the pan (13x9) and sprinkled a little of the dry seasonings in it and added some chopped pecans.  Then i rolled each piece (cut into 1/4's)  in the butter and then rolled them into dry seasonings and  layered them.  I added the extra seasonings on tpp and a few more crushed pecans.  Now I didnt want to wait all day for it to rise so I preheated my oven to 150 degrees and turned it off.  I put them in for about 2 hrs and they raised then baked on 350 for 15 mons, covered in foil and baked 15 mins longer.  Ummm Ummm Ummm!!!

I didn't have a bundt pan; so I made it in a cake pan, and it was still very good.  Best eaten immediately.  Otherwise it begins to harden.

Easy and really good! I think this recipe really needs butter instead of margarine and I will try it that way next time.

This is amazing! It's like a cinnamon roll and baklava all in one! I used a bundt pan and found that I only needed 2 packages of biscuits. I also used white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts worked into the pan.

This was the first recipe I added to my recipe box. Definitely a keeper. Left out the walnuts and raisins (personal taste), but I would like to try it with pecans. We used to buy Monkey Bread in the freezer section at the store...no more! This was easy and tastes much better!

This was awesome.  Made exactly as stated.  I think next time I will boil the brown sugar & butter mixture longer though because it turned quite hard, which tells me that the sugar hadn't melted thoroughly.  Wonderful recipe!!! Thank you!

The best recipe for monkey bread I've found! I used buttermilk biscuits and only had two 16 oz. cans. It was perfect. I used about 3/4c margarine instead just to be sure it wasn't dry. It ended up perfect, couldn't be more pleased. My husband doesn't throw out a "10" on hardly anything and he gave it a resounding 10!

Great monkey bread!  I've made monkey bread  several different ways and this is definitely the best recipe I've made.  I did change it up a a little bit and added more pecans.   My husband and the kids loved it and I did too!

I made it with 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup butterscotch pudding powder and sliced almonds instead.  I mixed all the powder ingredients together first and used it to coat the biscuit dough then used the leftover powder to make the coating with the butter.  Delicious.

It has become tradition that I bring this monkey bread to Christmas morning at Mom's house every year. I use buttermilk biscuits and I omit the nuts because not everyone in the family likes them. I do have a one-piece tube pan but I normally bake it in a stoneware bundt pan. Delicious!

This was really tasty, but there is WAY too much sugar! Unless you want to go into a diabetic coma, I suggest cutting it at least in half if not more. We had huge clumps of sugar left over after we ate the bread. I have a big sweet tooth but this was just too much.

Terrific recipe!  It's not only fast and easy, it' incredibly versatile.  Like several of the other reviewers I cut the recipe down to one package of biscuit dough since three is just way too much for two people, and reduced the other ingredients accordingly.  I baked the bread in a pie plate, and it took about 25 minutes, so if you do  reduce the size of the recipe, you'll need to feel your way through the baking process.  Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned adding vanilla to the brown sugar-butter mixture.  It added a mellowness that I wasn't expecting.  Very nice addition.  I also used a mixture of pumpkin pie spices and cardamom with the white sugar, and the flavor was excellent.  I used walnuts and almonds but no raisins.  I'd like to try it with dried apricot bits in the future.  My next variation will be to add cocoa powder to the white sugar-spice mix, and a bit of chocolate extract to the brown sugar-butter slurry, to make a lightly cocoa flavored bread.  I think you could add a lot of things to this, including some fresh fruit, with the caveat that most of them would need to be pre-cooked before adding to the pan of dough.  Otherwise the juices would make the bread too wet and it'd never bake properly,.  I would also suggest that you try kitchen shears to cut the dough.  Two snips and it's done.  Thanks to the original poster.  This is going to be a staple in my kitchen.

The inside didn't get done enough so I was forced to cook it a little longer...which made the bottom overdone. The soft parts were really yummy! I used a fluted bundt pan. I might try it again in something different.

I haven't made this since I was in home-ec class in middle school.  My hubby didn't know what monkey bread was so I told him I would make it. Since it is just the two of us I cut the recipe down a little bit and used 3 7.5 oz. tubes of buttermilk biscuits and used a loaf pan to cook them in.  When I cut the recipe down to 10 servings I think there ws still way too much cinnamon and sugar, I could have probably cut back even more on that.  However, everything else was spot-on and the loaf pan worked out just fine.  I think hubby ate 1/3 of it already!

This was easy and fun to make that I had my 3 yr. old son help me. If you like a cinnobun just think of it as an oversized bun. Its easy and fun to make and my kids love it and thats what really counts.

I'd never had monkey bread before, but it sounded delicious. I thought it was good, but it wasn't amazing or something I would crave. I think if I made it with sweeter dough it would be much better.

My husband and I were celebrating our first Christmas on our own, and I wanted to start a new tradition for breakfast Christmas morning.  After considering well over a dozen options, I picked this, and it was perfect - easy and delicious.  I cut the recipe in thirds and made a single loaf pan, which cooked for the full 1/2 hour.  Because I only made a third of the glaze, boiling it for a minute turned out to be a little too long, as it started to get hard.  Next time, I'll try for 45 seconds.  I'm so looking forward to having this year after year... yum!

I have been making this since I was a kid.  I add vanilla and use salted butter, as well as dark brown sugar for more of a caramel flavor.  YUMMY!

This was ridiculously good, and easy as anything!  I used 2 tubes (16 oz. each) of Grands Buttermilk biscuits and it filled my bundt pan perfectly.  I didn't change anything else, and there were no dry or burnt spots.  Absolutely delicious!

This was AWESOME, an amazing addition to Christmas breakfast!  I sprinkled some pecans in the pan before I began layering the coated biscuits, and I added 1/2 teas vanilla to the butter/brown sugar sauce.  14 thumbs up from the 7 of us- thanks!!

Simply Wow! I only omitted the raisins and opted to bake this heavenly yumminess in a stoneware loaf pan instead of my tube pan.  Thought I should heed all the warnings.  It turned out divine!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was really good and really easy. I ended up making it in two nine inch cake pans because I was giving one away. Just took about 7 minutes off the cooking time and it worked great.

This was really good.  Loved the caramel sauce!  I cut the recipe down to make enough for 1 container of biscuits.  I did not add the nuts or raisins - instead added 1/2 of a banana chopped (boyfriend's idea). Awesome!

This is an excellent recipe; so easy and it took no time at all to make! More importantly, it is delicious!  I only had 2 tubes of biscuit dough on hand, but it made the perfect amount for the 9" bundt pan I used. It filled the pan about 2/3 of the way and I had no problems with spillage in the oven. Aside from using only 2 tubes, (and adding hazelnuts) I followed the rest of the recipe as is. Thanks again for sharing!

Not so crazy about this one.  I like Quick & Easy Monkey Bread on allrecipes better because it uses rolls instead of biscuits.  I thought this was bland & boring compared to that one.  Sorry LuAnn!

I used slivered almonds that I toasted instead of walnuts and they tasted great. Would recommend using a good quality biscuit dough ( the cheap store brands taste gross in this recipe ).

I made this for my daughters for thier "tea party". They really enjoyed it! They named it Monkey Bread Pull(beacase they pulled it apart). I wonder if cinnamon rolls can be used too.

There are a few farmers' markets near my home, and the Amish families who sell baked goods almost always have these for sale.  They looked so good, I thought I'd try to make one myself.  I used only two cans of biscuit dough, and prepared it in a round cake pan.  For the folks who said the sauce overflowed the pan, try putting your cake pan on a cookie sheet.  At least that way, the run-over goes onto the cookie sheet and not onto the floor of your oven and you don't have to worry about filling your pan too full of biscuits.  This recipe was very good.  I might use this recipe again, but in the future I'll probably look for a recipe that uses homemade dough or use this recipe and make my own biscuits.

Made exactly as written except I didn't put raisins or nuts and it was awesome!  I took it to work and the guys devoured it!  I didn't have a bundt/tube pan so I just made it in a glass casserole dish, worked great!

Yum! I don't have a bundt pan, so I made a half recipe in a loaf pan. One tube of buscuits fit perfectly and no mess. After letting it cool slightly I tipped it over on a plate and served. Very, very naughty (calorie-wise), but oh so delicious!

LOVED IT!!!!!!  I used a bundt cake pan and sprayed it down with some cooking spray.  Fyi- when you flip the cake pan let it sit for a bit so they sauce can drip down. I didn't but I just spooned it out of my pan.  WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!!

Delicious and so easy! I followed the recipe exactly without adding nuts. The only thing I would do different is pour 1/2 of the sauce  in the middle and then the rest on top before baking so every part of the bread gets the yummy sauce.

Excellent and EASY recipe! I used a bunt pan but only used 2 of the 12 oz of the biscuits so it would not overflow in the oven and it was PERFECT! NO mess at all. I also made a little mistake and used a stick of butter instead of half. I do recommend flipping it over before it cools onto a plate. It looked beautiful and tasted even better!

This recipe was easy to make, tasted great, and my kids loved it!  It was easy for them to help as well.  I would be careful of using a tube pan though, a bundt pan would be better, because the syrup that coats it can leak out, causing a HUGE mess.

This did not work for me. I followed the recipe to the word. It did not bake all the way through in 35 minutes. When I finally got it cooked through, it tasted wonderful. But it was too late for my kids' breakfast.

My familu loves this morning Snack.. I made a few changes.   I added 1 can of cinnamon rolls and took out one tube of biscuits ...heated up the cinnamon roll icing and used it as a dip. I also make sure the bottom of the pan is cover in foil. Makes clean up easier and less chances of burning myself.

Only thing I added was halved marichino cherries for a little festive color. This was super easy and quite a hit with the family.

This is wounderful. I used two cans of Grands biscuits. I layered nuts, raisins, hand torn biscuits, butter sauce repeat.Used a Bundt pan, but put that on a cookie sheet.[just in case] I can't wait for my grandaughter's to sleep over and help make it. They'll be so happy to tell there mom,'they no how to make Monkey Bread.'

Wonderful.  Took the advice on the bundt pan.. however, the sugar mixture burnt a bit.  I will make an additional half of the mixture to pour over the monkey bread when done.  Husband thought it needed to be gooey-er.  and it did.

I used a bundt pan to make this with my daughter. We used real butter, not marg. as the recipe calls for..and I skipped the nuts and raisins (cause I'm allergic to nuts, and i hate raisins, although my daughter loves them). monkey bread is awesome.

The bones of this recipe are great- I add a sliced apple to the brown sugar/margarine mix, boil/cook for 3-5 minutes then add vanilla and rum extract. The apple cuts through the sticky sweetness and gives varied texture.   I thought it was rather obvious that baking anything syrupy in an angel food cake pan would only end in disaster- use a bundt style tube pan.

This recipe is perfect.  I used a 9.5" glass pie pan and it worked great.  I didn't use walnuts or raisins and used butter instead of margarine.  Great recipe, thanks!!!

Outstanding! I used only one can of Pillsbury Grands Jr-buttermilk biscuits. Cooked it in a 8'inch cake pan for 14 minutes and inverted in into another 8'inch pan as soon as it came out of the oven.Delicious!

A little to buttery.  The nuts (I used pecans) and raisins were an added plus to the monkey breads I have made in the past.  Definitely use a pizza cutter for the biscuit dough, it is the best and fastest way to quarter the dough.

My sister has a little bakery and is well known for her monkey bread, and until today i thought there was no better than hers. (Sorry sis!) I served this for Christmas morning and it is THE BEST monkey bread that our family of monkey bread connoisseurs have ever tasted!! Thank you Soooo much for the awesome recipe! The only thing i did differently was put a a little vanilla and light corn syrup in with the brown sugar/butter mixture it smoothed it out and made it really shiny and tasted fabulous. Holy excited over this recipe!

I tried this recipe because I was looking for something easy and good for Christmas morning.  I used 2 cans of biscuits instead of three and I also put mine in a bundt pan.  I did make the "gorilla bread" version from Paula Deen by adding cream cheese in the center of the dough and also used pecans instead of walnuts.  I omitted raisins because my family really does not care for them.  It turned out great.  Will make again.

The family RAVED about them! (I used pecans and raisins on the outside layer so those in the family who did not like them could easily eat around them. - Plus it made for a great presentation!)

I found the recipe to be really too sweet; however, the kids absolutely loved it! I believe the next time I make it, I will make less of it and just tweak the ingrediants. Great recipe for the kids and they actually made it!! Thanks.

Wow, this is wonderful. My daughter loved cutting up the biscuits and shaking them. This recipe is a nice replacement for cinnamon rolls and much easier. I used four 7.5 ounce cans of biscuits and followed the rest of the recipe except I use butter instead of margarine.

I made this exactly as the recipe says, except I used 4 packages of the 7.5 oz buttermilk biscuits because I didn't see that it called for 12 oz until it was too late.  My only complaint is that the butter/sugar combo didn't get everywhere like I was hoping.  Next time I might mix in some cream to make it thinner so it gets to more places.  The center part was the best!  Oh and I used a bundt pan after reading other reviews.  Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious and really easy to make! Some of the biscuits ended up a little undercooked, though, so I might add an extra five minutes or so to the baking time.

Highly recommended! This is one of the best desserts I have ever made. I love the crunchy caramelized crust on the outside of the bread. Thanks to the other reviews, I also added a tsp of vanilla to the margarine/brown sugar mixture. It gave it a tantalizing aroma!

I made this for a weekend brunch, and it was a big hit. I used 2 18-oz. packages of Grands biscuits (not buttermilk), and it made the perfect amount for my bundt pan. I also flipped it onto a plate immediately after removing it from the oven and let it cool that way for about 10 minutes, so the caramel sauce could trickle back down over all the bread. Then I removed the pan and we feasted on the gooey deliciousness! Definitely best while warm.

Big hit at my weekly meeting. At first my boss' response was "What is that?" He did not want to try it. Later, he wanted to know what bakery I got it from. I told him I made it and he was surprised.  That was all the acknowledgement that I needed.  I used jumbo butter biscuits and butter instead of margarine (so much better!). I would like to try it with a cream cheese filling like someone suggested or some kind of custard.  Either way, very yummy. Wonder what it would taste like using cinnamon roll dough?

I had this years ago at an office function and fell in love! It's amazingly simple and yummy. I have to be honest and say that I've used the generic forms of biscuits which come in slightly smaller rolls so I've never had the problem with it running over the sides! I also use a bundt pan, leave out the raisins and use pecans because of personal preference. SO Good!! I took this to a housewarming party, but I was late so everyone had already eaten. I found out the next day that my friend and her mom ate the entire thing for breakfast the next morning!! LOL She actually thanked me for showing up late the night before :oP

My girls had a blast helping make this.  I too used 2 16oz containers of grands buttermilk biscuits and I kinda goofed a bit but in the end it turned into a great error(this is why I should read the directions through before I start)..I didn't want to use all white sugar so I did 1/2 cup brown and a 1/2 cup white for the first part of the instructions.  After the girls filled the tube pan with all the coated dough..I realized the second part used brown sugar..OOPS!  So believe it or not I still had plenty of the mixture left after dipping my dough and I added that to the butter adding in a little extra brown sugar to make a full cup.  Turned out great and less sugar which is somewhat healthier for my kids.  Dont think you need all that sugar..It is kinda a waste.  Will make over and over again..or my girls will HEHE!

Very easy to make & tastes really good - love it!  I make this in a ceramic loaf pan, and flip it out onto a baking sheet while still hot so that the caramel sauce gets all the way through the bread.  I also use 2 16.25oz cans of Grands biscuits & cook for about 40 minutes.  My hubby & 2 daughters could not get enough of this!

Love, Love, Monkey bread, oh yeah, so does my family. I used a Bundt pan (less mess), and used butter instead of margarine made a little extra sauce, it didn't quite make it to the bottom of the pan. Now, I'm going to make some more.

This is such a good treat, very yummy. If you like a more gooey monkey bread, double the sauce your poor on it before baking. But both ways is good. 
Like other reviewers have said, it tends to get a little hard within 24 hours. Tearing off a portion and microwaving it for 25 seconds does the trick to soften and warm it up again.

I cannot believe it has taken me this long in my baking career to discover Monkey Bread!  

CHANGES I MADE:  I used lots of pecans instead of walnuts, unsalted BUTTER instead of margarine, extra-large buttermilk biscuits, added a pinch of cardamom and ginger to the cinnamon-sugar mixture, and added 1/4 cup dark rum to the brown sugar glaze.  Boiled the glaze as recommended and poured over before baking.

The rum definitely adds that extra grown-up WOW factor.  

I had people fighting for the last lick of sauce at the bottom of the pan!

My husband requested a cinnamon roll type result at about 7pm at night.  About an hour later we were enjoying warm delicious bread!  SOOOO EASY.  You have to try it, presents beautifully for guests also.

I used 4 packages of biscuits, the cheap kind you find at Wal-Mart and I used a Bundt pan too b/c I heard NOT to use the Angel Food pan b/c it will drip over into your oven (not a good thing). This recipe was wonderfully yummy!!!

Fabulous - easy- recipe. It's so very yummy, and hard to walk away from. When I made it tonight, I decided to play with the recipe some, and added a teensy bit of cream cheese rolled up into each piece of quartered biscuit dough. I only made a 1/3 of the recipe - since there are only 2 of us (time reduced to 10 minutes in an a 8in. round pan for the recipe size reduced to a 1/3). It was really, really good with the bits of cream cheese.

I made this recipe for my husband, who loves Monkey Bread and he loved it!  I made it with Buttermilk biscuits, which stayed nice and moist.  As soon as I brought the pan out of the oven, I flipped it over so the sauce could run all the way down, while it cooled.  

I bought a "Monkey Bread Pan" from Williams Sonoma, and it worked great.  It took 4 (small) cans of biscuits to fill the pan.  

This is a delicious recipe!

This was so good! I used some Rhodes frozen roll dough to make it (thawed, of course!).  It looked picture-perfect when it came out of the pan and tasted divine.

Loved this recipe! It's rich though so it definitely feeds a crowd. 
P.S. If you have a sweet tooth like me, sprinkle some of the sugar and cinnamon mix in between the biscuit layers as you go along. (There's extra at the end so you can afford to...)

This was too die for! I cut the recipe to 5 servings and just cooked one layer in a loaf pan. It turned out great. I recommend that you make a little extra of the brown sugar/butter mixture for extra tastiness.

Quick and tasty.  I made this recipe with the help of Squeaker (our 2 year old granddaughter, she helped cut the biscuits with a plastic knife.)  It was easy, delicious and fun to make.  The only thing missing was the powdered sugar frosting which we'll add the next time.  We plan to use the recipe for years to come.  Thank you for sharing it with us.

I've made the monkey bread twice and really should have read a few more reviews the first time around.  I baked it in a regular loaf pan and it overflowed and burned in my oven.  I learned the second time around and placed it in a bundt pan and followed others advice and poured some of brown sugar/butter mixture in between the layers.  I think that allowed it to seep through more of the bread.  Other than the mishap the first time, this is a very good recipe.

Not one crumb left! I cooked the butter/brown sugar until it was a caramel-like consistency, this will alleviate the grainy texture some have complained about. I also poured half of the mixture over the biscuits when the Bundt pan was half full to distribute more evenly. Also serve this warm, it will harden when cooled and will be  difficult to pull apart!!! Still delicious though!!!

My mom used to make this for us on Sunday mornings and I had forgotten about it until I saw this recipe.  Thanks for bringing back an old favorite.  I made it even easier.  I melted the butter in the microwave, added all the other ingredients, threw in the biscuit pieces and tossed.  It was delicious!  I don't like raisins, so I left those out.

This was fun to make with my two kids, and smelled heavenly while baking!  I too poured half the sugar/butter mix over halfway through and then the rest on top.  It's hard to stop eating it once you start!!!!

My first time making this type of bread...poured the butter/sugar mixture in between layers of the dough, not just all at once. Don't overbake this, cook exactly as stated. And no peeking while it bakes! My stepdad ate half of this by himself. He was supposed to be on a diet! Thanks for a great recipe!!

"Let it cool"?? Who are YOU kidding? I made a serious dent in the thing before it was cool enough to eat (that's OK. We're taking it camping and they'll never know ;)). This has got to be one of the easiest recipes I've ever made. The whole thing took about 15 minutes to put together. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I used the 2-piece pan. Once it was greased, I placed the pan on a tin foil lined cookie sheet and folded the sides of the foil up around the pan. Didn't leak, but thank goodness I had the warning. Used butter instead of margarine, but will try adding lecithin to keep the brown sugar and butter together a little more. Will also wait a few minutes before flipping over onto a cake pan (instead of right away as other reviewers suggested). Most of the sugar mix ended up at the bottom instead of seeping through because it was so hot. However, this might be a good thing as it really is sweet enough as it is without more "sauce" on top. Omitted the walnuts and just added raisins. Tastes just like a cinnamon bun right out of the oven! Wonder how it will taste cool instead of warm. Will see tomorrow, but will definitely make again regardless!!

I thought this was pretty good.  I'm so glad I read other reviews before I made it; because it dripped a lot & if I hadn't been warned ahead of time I would have had a big mess in my oven! I also knew ahead of time to make extra sauce to pour on top afterwards...it definitly needed more.  My only complaint was that the sauce didn't taste too "carmely"...it was more "brown-sugary."  (But it was still good.) To help it be more carmely I add corn syrup and that seems to do the trick!

This was a fabulous recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to use chopped pecans instead of walnuts and I used butter instead of margarine with the brown sugar.  I couldn't leave it alone.

Absolutely amazing!... I've tried numerous french toast casseroles and cinnamon rolls, but this one is by far the best...  Be sure to make two if you're feeding a group of guys after they've been hunting because you can never have enough!

Yum!  My only complaint is that I get a stomach-ache because I eat WAY too much of this :)  I cut the recipe to 5 servings and cooked it in a small ramekin for ~20 minutes and it came out perfectly!

MMMM Good!  This was super easy to make - I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I found it easier to put the cinammon and sugar mixture in a bowl and cover the biscuit pieces that way so they were completely covered and away we went.  My 3 year old next door neighbor LOVED it as did my family.  Will definately make it again.  Thanks LuAnn!

My ex-boyfriends mother used to make this and I thought I'd never find this recipe again...I love this site!!!  I tweaked it just a little by adding some cinnamon honey to the syrup mixture.  It's a Sunday morning favorite!!!

I made this over the weekend and I was very pleased with the results.  The only changes I made was cooking it in a cake pan, because I don't have a bundt pan and not adding the raisins.  I'll be making this again in the future.

This is good stuff - but I simplified it a bit.  I don't like to dirty too many pans! I reduced the sugar to about 2/3 cup, and coated the biscuits in sugar and cinnamon before I snipped them into fourths with my kitchen shears, letting the pieces fall back into the sugar mixture to coat them a little more.  I put them into my bundt pan and poured melted butter over the top.  Worked like a charm!  And the reduced sugar worked out better for my hypoglycemic sweet-toothed friend.

This bread is amazing! I made it for Mother's Day, and everyone in my family loved it. My mom tells everyone about it. I didn't change the amount of any ingredients, but I did cut the rolls into quarters which made them bite size. I rolled them in butter, and then the brown sugar mixture. It took a little longer, but it's worth it.

I didn't know my son had recently made these in his home economics class at school.  When he walked into the kitchen he said, "These are AWESOME!" I used a bundt pan with 3 7.5 oz. cans of biscuts and didn't use the nuts or raisins.  I filled the bundt pan about 2/3 full and it came out perfect with a very nice presentation.

This recipe was great!  It's easy to make...but I did not need that many biscuits.  I used two small cans (7.5oz)and one 10 oz can and sliced them in halves instead of quarters.  I also used a bundt pan. Fill only 2/3 of the pan.  It rises quite a bit.

I made this for a breakfast party at work and prepared the dough pieces the night before. I kept them in a Ziploc bag in the refrigerator and in the morning just placed them in the pan and prepared the caramel sauce. Very good results.

Followed directions but used butter instead of margarine and pecans instead of walnuts. It turned out awesome. It was a great 20 minute project for me and my girls for movie night.  We did not have a problem with it sticking in the pan but we generously sprayed it. We waited 10 minutes for it to cool and it popped out just fine. One note:  I suggest you put the cake pan on a sheet pan in the oven because ours bubbled over and started to burn on the bottom of the oven.  We used 12oz refrigerated pillsbury buttermilk biscuits.

Used a bunt pan and set on a cookie sheet to bake. Covered with foil the first 25 minutes and the top did not burn and the middle was super moist. Also poured half the butter mixture while layering the dough in the pan. Truly helps reading reviews! Thanks everyone!

Delicious! I read many other reviews and used 2 cans of grands biscuits. I omitted the nuts (son wears braces) and raisins (didn’t have any). I also poured some of the butter/brown sugar glaze over about 1/2 the biscuit pieces and then added the remaining pieces. After letting the bread sit for about 5 minutes, I inverted it onto a plate. What yummy goodness this recipe is.

Came out awesome. Used the bundt pan, 2 cans of Grands homestyle biscuits, after spraying with Pam, crushed pecans and just put them at the bottom of the Bundt, and followed the recipe otherwise. Came out great.

I have made this several times.  And, it is both beautiful and a real crowd pleaser!  Warning: you must butter the pan thoroughly to prevent sticking.  When it comes to cooling and flipping, timing is EVERYTHING to avoid sticking.  Let it cool just enough to set and flip onto a nice serving plate or cake dish.

It's pretty good, but there should be a couple extra things in the instructions. 
1. Don't let it cool for 10 minutes, maybe 2.  The margarine/sugar coating solidifies when it cools too much, and bonds to the pan.  So if it cools down, it rips the top off of the bread.
2. The pan holds it together.  Once you flip it over, you can't really move it to another plate or it breaks apart.

I made this as instructed but with Pillsbury Grande buttermilk biscuits. I'm not sure if the biscuits are larger than what the recipe calls for or what the issue was, but we ended up with half cooked Monkeybread. I even let it cook for an additional 15 minutes before taking it out of the oven and it still had about a quarter of the biscuits un- or under-cooked.  The kids loved the parts which were done, which is the reason for the three of five starts. We may try again, but we will see. It also had the major flavor of store-bought biscuit dough rather than good homemade dough, so another strike against it.

OMG!!!!  This was so too poor!  I made a few changes. I added a tablespoon of vanilla extract to the brown sugar mixture. I also added more butter to the brown sugar. I placed a few pieces of cream cheese in between the biscuit pieces. And at the beginning I dipped the biscuits in butter before putting them in the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Everything came out wonderful!!!!  Very good.

I do much of my baking in a compact convection toaster oven. It's big enough for the bundt pan, but I generally need to adjust recipes down about 10 degrees and shorten bake time a few minutes, especially when using a dark pan. I did that in this instance, and the bread came out rather doughy. I'm quite willing to believe this was due to my adjustments, and not the fault of the recipe! Otherwise, it was a winner - quite easy to prepare, and nice caramel flavour to the glaze. We used pecans rather than walnuts.

I actually flubbed it up, and it tastes great anyway!  I had leftover sugar/cinnamon in the bag, and added it to the melted butter and brown sugar.  It was to thick, and it didn't run down thru.  But it was delicious.. I can't wait to try it again, without messing it up!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good! I used two 16oz. store brand biscuits which filled the pan to the top when done. As another review stated, I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the brown sugar and butter mix. Baked very well in my convection oven.

I made this recipe, however, I did follow the suggestions of several other reviewers which made this the best monkey bread I have ever made. First, I used a bundt cake pan (not a tube). Second, I used only two packages of biscuits, however, they were 16 oz packs, so the recipe called for 36 oz total, and I used 32 oz. Third, I took half the butter and melted it, mixed in a tsp vanilla, then tossed the biscuits in it, after which I tossed them in the sugar (I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup which was plenty), along with 2 tsp cinnamon, and the nuts (I used pecans because I love them). Fourth, I melted the remaining butter (1/4 cup) with 1/4 cup water, brought it to a simmer, then added the brown sugar, plus 1 tsp vanilla, 2 more tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp sea salt. Brought it all to a quick boil for less than a minute, and then poured it over evenly and baked it as stated. Also, upon taking it out of the over, I dumped it upside down on a plate immediately, as suggested, which meant all that caramelly goodness oozed all across it. It was definitely the BEST monkey bread I have ever made. People couldn't stop eating it!

Easy way to make some pretty good monkey bread.  The only part I have issues with is when boiling the sugar/butter.  If you cook this too long the sugars will have the wrong texture.  I'd error on the side of under cooking though I haven't found the sweet spot yet.

This is a great recipe as it is but I kicked it up for a Christmas by using Pillsbury Orange rolls and Craisins. I added half the orange frosting to the caramel mixture and drizzled the rest over the top after it cooled a bit.  This was a huge hit for my family.

very easy! I did take some suggestions and made this with 2 cans of biscuit dough and I decreased the amount of butter by 1/3. I didn't have any raisons so I left them out. I'll be making a basic powdered sugar icing to put on the side when I serve it tomorrow. The best advice is definitely to flip the pan when you first get it out of the oven and allow it to cool like that. I greased the pan well and it came right off when I removed it 3 hours later. Microwave in the oven for 2ish minutes before serving if serving the next day.

I just made a couple of changes to this recipe. I used 2 cans of flaky biscuits and cut them into sixths. I added cinnamon chips. And I used a cake pan because I don't own a bundt style pan. 

Very tasty! Everyone loved it. :)

Very simple but very delicious recipe! I will be using this recipe again. 
I used Pillsbury Grands Buttermilk Layers biscuits, crushed pecans instead of walnuts, and I also added small pieces of cream cheese in random pieces. I added the brown sugar mixture halfway through the layering process, on top and again after it came out the oven. It came out the fantastic!

This is a great, tasty, an kid approved recipe - and more importantly, my mom approved (and she is a great cook)! I did not use nuts or raisins due to kids this time, but the basic recipe is great. I cut each biscuit in half (as in picture I posted), sometimes quartered. I add around a 1/3 cup brown sugar to the white sugar and cinnamon mix (as a result, I have extra that is used for breads, etc). I did buy the 4-pack biscuits, so used all 4 in a bundt pan and it did not rise above the rim -but just to it- so a great feast! I like to dust with powdered sugar for the look on just the top of the monkey bread.

I made this for my team in the kitchen and it was gone in 10 minutes. Obsessed, easy and perfectly sweet. A definite must make for any occasion... especially a bunch occasion. :) 

Note: Used Earth Balance as the dairy substitute due to dairy allergies. Worked divine.

Pretty good, awfully sweet but I guess that's what you get with 2 cups of sugar!  I only had the little Pillsbury biscuits (7.5 ounces) so I used 3 of them.  It filled up the bundt pan.  I'd halve this recipe and make it in a round cake pan.  It would be plenty for 4 breakfasts.

Yummy! The only change I made was putting the cut pieces side-by-side on a large cookie sheet, single layer. Drizzled the sauce over it and baked it for 12 minutes, every piece is perfect! We did make a thin icing to drizzle over the finished product, sweet but so good!!!

We make this every year for Christmas brunch.  Saw this recipe and thought I would try it as something different than our standard recipe.  Followed instructions exactly.  Came out perfectly.  Even better than our old recipe.  Will definitely be making this again.

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out good. The only issue I had was that the caramel was very sticky but not in a good way. More in a stuck to my teeth and had to be picked off way. Next time I'll just put the melted butter and brown sugar in the pan and let it melt together while it bakes.  I'll definitely make this again though

so easy- my kids make this after checking their stockings and waiting for us to wake up Christmas morning. we serve it with fruit on the side.
 there's only 4 of us, so 2 cans of biscuits was plenty. really cant go wrong, similar to cinnamon rolls but more fun.

2 cans of Grands Buttermilk biscuits filled my 10" bundt pan 3/4 of the way full, and even at that, it almost spilled over the top when it rose! I followed the recommendation to cut the biscuits into fourths with a pizza cutter - great tip! It didn't take anywhere near 35 minutes to cook - at 25 minutes, the top was getting really brown, and it could have probably gone only about 20 minutes and been fine. With some tweaking of cooking time and measurements, I think this could be a five-star recipe - even for a first try, it came out pretty yummy!

I made it the night before and used pecans on the bottom of the pan with 4 little Aldi cans of buttermilk biscuits. Didn't need all of the cinnamon sugar. I also used 1/2 package of butterscotch pudding mix (cook and serve kind) on bottom with pecans. Christmas morning favorite!

Best Ever!!!  I used a Bundt pan with small amount of Pam spray.  I also used 2 cans of Grands Biscuits instead of 3 regular and it was the perfect amount.  My 14 year old son even helped without any kind of bribe but the end results.  I brought them with me and my son (with just a couple of small pieces missing, lol) thinking they would be great for breakfast the following morning with my brother, sister-in-law and niece.  They didn't make it til morning.  Gone in the first hour of getting to the hotel.  Easy, delicious and excellent for breakfast or dessert.  Will be making these for many years to come.

My stepkids and I spend a lot of time together, and one of the ways we do that is by cooking together. I decided to make this for my son's 8th birthday instead of the traditional birthday cake. There's a lot of kids in the family so I figured it would be a welcome change. We had so much fun making this. My 12 year old was on biscuit cutting duty, and my 10 and 8 year old were on sugaring and layering duty. It was fun and easy for all of us to make, and turned out pretty good too! I only ended up using 2 tubes of biscuits (where I live they come in 16 oz cans) and I was using a smaller bundt than usual. It turned out perfect and I don't think the sugar would have coated all three tubes it just coated the 2 perfectly (I did sub margarine for butter though simply because I didn't have any). I baked it for 35 minutes and nothing was raw, the top was kind of crunchy and I liked that. The kids thought it was good but after a day of pizza and birthday treats they were a bit burned out by the sweet processed taste of this treat. I'm not sure if we will make this again, making a cake myself would've been cheaper IMO, though I'm sure the variations are endless with the different kinds of biscuits (how about blueberry biscuits with blueberry syrup, or better yet, homemade biscuits) but if one of my kids asks for it I will probably do it just for them.

I loved this recipe, it came out a little on the dry side for my family. We tend to enjoy our desserts very moist. Next time I think I will add a little more of the brown sugar sauce to moisten it up a little. It was exactly what I was looking for though!

Fabulous!
My 12 year old grandson helped sugar coat the pieces and fill the pan (easy!) while I melted the butter and sugar.  We used the Wilton Sand Castle heavy aluminum pan (for lack of having a bundt pan) and it looked AWESOME!!! The lumps/bumps of the pieces made it look like a Harry Potter castle made of rocks, etc.  I'll never again use a white cake recipe for that pan.  This Monkey bread is quick, easy and, oh...recipe says serves 15....ahhhhhh, more like 6 hungry adults!
I use half dark/ half light brown sugar with the butter.  Yummy!

We absolutely love monkey bread in all its fattening glory.  However, reading over the reviews, I notice the very first reviewer mentions NOT to use a  tube pan because they are 2-piece pans!  Although you CAN purchase tube pans with removable parts, the ones I choose (been baking since I was 9 and won blue ribbons for my baking) are NEVER that type!  It's very sad that the child, and others, got burned.  Boiling sugar causes BAD burns!  Use a NORMAL tube/bundt pan, not one with removable parts and do NOT use a springform pan!

We actually make this using homemade biscuit dough!

Love this recipe and so easy to throw together - especially easy for brunch.  be sure to read the size of the can as they vary between manufacturers to make sure you don't have too much biscuit or the center will be undercooked.  I followed a friend's suggestion and just got 3 cans of Grands Buttermilk - too much biscuit - almost raw in the center.

My family gobbled this right up. I did omit the nuts and raisins as my kids don't care for them but without they just loved this. I thought it would last until tomorrow but it was gone shortly after dinner.

Awesome.  Used cran-strawberries and toasted my walnuts first.  Also added Hershey's chocolate syrup into the carmel mixture. Took half to work and it was gone in a few hours.  It was really fun to put together.  Thanks for the recipe!

brown sugar topping got a little grainy, perhaps I cooked it too long.  Next time probably won't boil it for one minute, just let the butter melt until the sugar is melted and combined.  Frozen biscuit dough works as well as the tube kind.  Good recipe.

I must have spent ten minutes in front of the refrigerated biscuit dough trying to figure out which one would work, because nothing seemed to fit the description of the recipe! FYI, I settled on two tubes of the Large Southern-Style biscuits, and that worked perfectly. I cut those Large biscuits into 6 pieces rather than 4 as the recipe suggests, and that worked great.

I used a glass cake like pan an it worked well. I Only cooked for about 25 minutes. Also I used the cinnamon and sugar mix instead of plain cinnamon since that's all I had. I still  put the 1 cup of sugar. I was a little worried it would be too sweet but it turned out awesome. My 5 year old loves it. Will make again soon..

I usually cut this in half since it makes a huge batch...it is hard to beat served warm along with other breakfast items.  Could be a great late night snack as well.

I told the family I was bringing Monkey Bread to the Super-Football-Game party.  They ignored me.  As insurance I made chocolate cookies, as my family always eats chocolate first.  I needn't have bothered with the cookies.  This was DIVINE.  This was the first time I made Monkey Bread, and it still turned out as beautifully as the photos.  One family member had told me in advance they knew they wouldn't care for it.  That person then informed me this was their favorite dessert ever and I would have to make it for their birthday.  It seems like such a simple recipe, but it was much better received than a lot of time-consuming dishes I've made.  Seriously, you can't go wrong with this.  I also took the advice to add a packet of cook-and-serve butterscotch pudding mix to the sugar mixture that I rolled the dough in.  Monkey Bread is destined to become a family tradition!

Just tried this for the first time, love it! I had 3 tubes of biscuits but since my bundt pan was small I only used part of the third tube. Also the butter-sugar topping spilt over, my fault for not remembering to decreases ingredients, hubby is in heaven thank you

This bread was very yummy and my 6 yr old LOVED it! Easy recipe, both of my daughters helped (ages 6 & 3 yrs old). Followed the advice of others and ONLY used 2 cans of biscuit dough. Any more than that and you will have a huge mess in your oven.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I was hoping the bread would have a gooey caramel coating dripping down the sides when I flipped it out of the pan.  Instead it had a hard, sugary crust.  I gave it 3 stars because my family enjoyed it but I will try a different recipe next time.

Everyone complaining about the tube pan... She put a note in saying only to use SOLID TUBE PANS, not the ones with the removable bottoms, which is what it sounds like. If you do have to use one of those, just put a cookie sheet under it and wear some oven mitts when you take it out. (D'oii!) This was delicious. I don't even have a tube pan so I used a bundt pan, which made it kind of dry, but it was still good.

I had never made monkey bread before and this recipe is a winner. I didn't have refrigerated biscuits here in France, so I made biscuit dough from scratch and went from there. This got raves and requests for the recipe from the whole group after just ONE BITE! It's so delicious!

It was good but I really didn't care for the glazed parts of the bread. I preferred the dryer sections. The gooeyness of the bread was a little much for me. Next time I'll try making it without the sauce. By the way, a tube pan worked perfectly for me with 2 biscuit rolls. I didn't have any overflow.

Oh yum! Made this today and it is delicious but I would possibly double the margarine and brown sugar as the bottom of the bread was more dry than the top. And instead of using the 36 oz of biscuits, we used 32 oz and it overflowed our bundt pan. But will definitely be making again....with additional glaze or something on the side!

To speed things up, cut the biscuits in half with scissors, place in large bowl with a cover and cinnamon/sugar mixture, cook butter and sugar in the microwave, then put in springform pan.  All prep done in 5 minutes.  More time to enjoy Christmas.

Love this recipe and have made it for years. There seems to be a debate in the house though....the kids want nuts left out and the wife wants the raisins left out, well dad likes both so until they start making it that's what their going to get.  :)  Anyway the only change I make is I go ahead and cut they dough pieces and coat them and set aside, then I make the sauce. Doing it this way allows me to add the sauce as I am layering ensuring that the sticky goodness is throughout the bread. We also use pecans instead of walnuts.

So yummy, the only reason I held back
1 star, is b/c of the amount of Cinnamon
was a bit over powering. I will scale back
to maybe 1/2 of recommended.

This recipe is excellent! I normally make mini ones in muffin pans so they are more portable. When I know I'm going to be in a rush in the morning, but still want to have this, I prepare everything the night before, and just make the syrup in the morning to pour over and then bake. It's still just as good!

Delicious and sweet.  I made it in a brownie pan so that every bite got some ooey goodness!  Plus, it cooked 5 minutes faster.  I did have leftover white sugar/cinnamon.

My mom brought this recipe to us around christmas when i was around 10. It began an anual ritual to have monkey bread christmas morning.  Unless requested on a birthday, the only day a year we got to dig our hands into this AWESomE treat.  Now as an adult, i am surprised to find out just how easy and low ingredient number it takes.  I didn't have a bunt pan, but luckily i started reading these reviews just in time to put a large cookie sheet under my 9x12 casserole pan.  dont worry... the cookie sheet has about a 1" lip on it to catch the overflow.  Regardless as to how it looks when it comes out, i KNOW there will be no problem getting it to vanish in seconds.  I love you monkey bread!

This is so easy and so good and so sending me on the treadmill tomorrow! I used two cans of the Grands flaky butter biscuits, sprinkled walnuts over the layers, threw in a tsp of vanilla with the brown sugar/butter sauce and kept everything else the same. The two cans were just right for a 10 inch bundt pan. Baked perfectly in 35 minutes and rose right to the top. I did have left over cinnamon sugar mix and sprinkled it over the top when I flipped it out of the pan. Yummy!!!

This was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. I had a standard bundt pan and followed the recipe exactly (left out nuts). It was one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted. It melted in your mouth. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe. I used 2 small cans of biscuits and 1/2 of the butter/brown sugar mixture. Then I baked it in a loaf pan for 25-30 minutes. Family loved it! They were gone in about 10 minutes tops!!!

Delicious! I followed the recipe, leaving out the raisins and substituting pecans for walnuts, for a brunch and it could not have turned out any better. I received rave reviews from family and friends and will definitely be making this again.

Finally, a dessert my husband will eat that doesn't involve strawberries and whipped cream! I made my biscuits from scratch (I added cinnamon and nutmeg), doubling the recipe, and made homemade caramel as well. The biscuits were rolled in the cinnamon sugar and stacked, with a butter-white sugar mixture poured on top. The latter soaked into the bread, so I made caramel and poured THAT on top after it came out of the pan to keep it sweet and moist. Good stuff!

Made this for four people, expected left overs, had none.  I did leave out the raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts.

This was sinfully delicious!!! I used 2 16 oz packages of buttermilk biscuit dough (the jumbo size) and didn't quarter them, I just halved them and it worked fine. Didn't need as much cinnamon/sugar mixture. I'd say about 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 cup white sugar. The brown sugar/butter mixture was perfect. I didn't use raisins or nuts cause I didn't have them. I sprayed a bundt pan with lots of pam and placed all the biscuit balls inside. This was the perfect amount of dough for my pan. It came out perfect!

I know this could be a great recipe but I only gave it three stars because I followed this recipe "to a T" and I am clearly doing something wrong. The dough was undercooked in the middle but if I left it in the oven longer the top and edges would have been too crispy. I did as another had suggested and removed the bread from the pan when it came out of the oven and flipped it over so the carmel could seep thru all the way around.

I can't believe I've never made this....but, made it for a food at work - followed recipe with the walnuts.  Used a bundt pan.  Everyone raved about how it was just the right amount of sweetness.  Will be making this often.

Made this for Christmas brunch, and it was a hit with my kids! We used buttermilk biscuit dough and baked two batches in bread pans, one pan with walnuts and the other without (nut allergies in our house). We omitted the raisins. It was a simple and easy-to-follow recipe with big taste! Next time I will let the kids help, it was that easy to make. I only gave this four stars because the Monkey Bread was slightly dry.

This was sooo good.  I made it for our only Christmas day desert.  I followed directions exactly.  I added diced apples in my layers along with the chopped walnuts.  My husband who is not a sweet eater actually put a big dent in it.  I did notice that the bread pieces really sucked up the cinnamon from the shaker bag making the wedges come out almost white.  So I just sprinkled in some more cinnamon to the sugar.  I really liked the finished coloring.  Darn, I forgot to take a picture.

So loved this! I used the idea of cream cheese in each quarter of a biscuit, VERY time cosuming and not very good. I also used theidea of apple pie filling between layers, AMAZING and worth actually only using two layers and more filling next time. Will use this again and again. I am wondering if it would be as good with Rhodes bicuits so that it could be done the night before and make it a perfect Christmas morning dish, as coming home from church and making it was just a little too long, hubby was chomping at the bit to open his gifts! :) Also, it made enough to feed like 10 people, since it had cream cheese and filling, it actually erupted out of the pan. I used a bundt pan. Enjoy! Go for the pie filling. SOOOO yummy! :)

Didn't have walnuts on hand, but raisins were enough. Added a little almond & vanilla extract to butter and brown sugar mixture. Will try this recipe with walnuts next time. Taste wonderful! Son and daughter did 90% of the work (I just did stove-top, hot liquid and oven steps). They also give their approval.  Good with coffee, or vanilla ice cream.

Thumbs up from everyone! I've never made monkey bread w/a caramel sauce before. Usually, I just dip the biscuit pieces in melted butter & then cinnamon-sugar. This was a hit. Be careful, tho, it takes a while for it to cool!!

WOW!!!!  This came out so wonderfully delicious.  I prepared exactly as the recipe stated just a smaller amount and used a 8 inch pan instead.  I only used 1 16oz. can of the big buttermilk biscuits. When me and my daughter first put them in the pan I wondered if it would be enough...when I took it out the oven...I no longer was concerned.  The biscuits plumped up nice and fluffy and the whole thing put together was absolutely to die for!!!  It was delicious and very fulfilling!  Just the one can of the big biscuits was more than enough for my family, almost too much actually...but I also made with sausage and a fruit salad on the side! I followed some reviewers recommendations and let my daughter cut the biscuits with a pizza cutter, which she seemed to really enjoy! Thank you for this recipe...we will be making this one again...I'm thinking Thanksgiving and Christmas morning!!! :-)

Great recipe, and easy to follow! I've make it several times for pot luck breakfasts or brunches. To give it a little something extra, I put nuts, raisins, and 1/4 cup of maple syrup in the bottom of the bundt pan and add the bisquits on top. It's very pretty when it comes out. I also add a a little heavy cream to the butter/sugar mixture. It gives it more of a caramel consistency. Delicious!

This has become a much requested treat from co-workers and at family gatherings. It is simple yet its gooey sweetness makes its addicting! It is somewhat time consuming to build the bread but well worth it

The taste is okay, but the butter/brown sugar syrup kind of gets hard in the bottom of the pan, so when you turn it upside down and take it out of the pan, you have a hardened crust on the top.  I probably wouldn't make this recipe again.

I make this this a lot because my grandkids love it. I use bread, either frozen or home made (which it is what I do)using a bundt pan. I also add chopped walnuts.

I made this recipe as written.  The only thing I found that I would change is the amount of cinnamon used.  It is a bit heavy for my tastes.

This was soooo good!  I did not use nuts or raisins.  Everyone agreed that it needs a little more of the butter/brown sugar caramel sauce.  Next time I will use 3/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  I used only 2 1/4 biscuits tubes cause I was afraid of it bubbling over.  Just enough.

If you don't have a bundt pan, no worries. An angel food cake (tube pan) lined with foil does the trick. I cut two, long rectangular pieces, punctured a hole in the middle of them, and put them crisscross into the pan. Then I sprayed the foil with Pam. No mess!

I make this bread for my son but we call it gorilla bread because we add cream cheese to it. You get a block of cream cheese and dice it up and you take your biscuit dough quarters and wrap them around the cream cheese and bake as usual. It is his special breakfast treat on holiday mornings!!!

I remember this recipe from Jr high Home Ec!  Now that was a while ago!  And it's as good now as it was then!  The only thing I changed was adding about 1/3-1/2 cup of caramel syrup to the brown sugar and butter.  It gives the recipe a bit more of a candied taste! Yummmmm, give it a try!

great recipe!  our four year old loved it from the minute the smell started coming out of the oven and he's very picky about anything "new".  I used five 6 oz. tubes of layered biscuits and that was the perfect amount, all the other ingredients the same.  also used light brown sugar and it was less sticky.  my mom made this when we were kids and it brought back so many great memories!  thanks for the recipe!

My family is picky about nuts and raisins.  I made this recipe leaving them both out, and it was absolutely delicious!  My husband said this is going to be our new Christmas breakfast tradition.  He loved it!  I put it in a cake container, and it stayed fresh for several days afterwards.  Like other reviewers, I also used a bundt pan.  It was not messy at all and was beautiful!

I used 3 cans of 7.5 oz biscuits, instead of the larger ones.  Halved the remaining ingredients, because I didn't need as much sugar/cin mix or sauce.  Only took 30 min. to cook in the bundt pan- wonderful!!  This will be a new family favorite!

I've made this several times and it's delicious everytime.  I don't waste my time with a pizza roller - I just use a big chef's knife.  I take a little water spritzer and spray the biscuit pieces with a smidge of water so the cinnamon sugar sticks to the biscuits really well.  I sprinkly any leftover cinnamon sugar over the biscuits, add pecans, and skip the raisins.  Only once have I been able to get the caramel sauce together properly, even following all the suggestions.  The last time, I just left it off and it was still great.

One word: awesome.  I used only 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and skipped the nuts and raisins.  I also only used 2 16-ounce cans Pillsbury buttermilk biscuit dough and it was the perfect size.

I made this for the first time Christmas morning. It was soooo easy and turned out wonderfully. I only used 2 grands biscuits cans, as someone else suggested. It was the perfect amount for 8 of us. I think the only thing that may be better is to layer the butter/sugar mix with the biscuits instead of pouring it all over the top. But what a fantastic recipe and so quick and easy!

An excellent recipe. This is always a hit! I've never had a problem with it overflowing or burning. Sometimes I use slivered almonds instead of the walnuts and I usually increase the cinnamon. LOVE this recipe!

I've always made this type of recipe with frozen bread dough, but thought refigerated biscuits would be easier for my two little boys to make for Christmas morning. It just wasn't as good. I'll stick with bread dough. I bought butter-flavored biscuits on accident (Walmart changed their packaging); that didn't help.

I made this today for Christmas breakfast and OMG, it was good!  Even my picky non-sweets-loving husband ate three servings and nearly made himself sick on it.  This will definitely be a holiday tradition for us.  And I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  Thanks for submitting!

This was amazing. I used 3 packages of the grands sized rolls, cut into 6ths and multiplied the recipe by 1 1/3 times. I just have 2 suggestions...1. Use butter  2. Boil water and pour over the raisins, then cover and let sit for a few minutes, then drain and dry. It worked well to prepare everything the night before then put in the fridge over night. I just popped it in the oven this morning. It took about 45 minutes to bake.

I made this on Christmas morning for the first time. My 3 year old even helped me! It was sooo easy and so incredibly YUMMY!!!!!! It tastes like a cinnamon roll, mmmmmmm. The only thing I did differently was I spritzed the dough pieces with a little water so the cinnamon/sugar mixture would stick better because at first, it didn't stick too well. That required minimal effort though. It was absolutely delicious and it looks like we found a new Christmas morning tradition! :)

This is such a great recipe. I've made others that use evaporated milk for the sauce mix but this way is so much more simpler for an even better result. I use a pizza cutter to cut up the biscuits but I put the pieces in a bowl to coat with the cinnamon sugar just so I can make sure they don't stick to one another. Sometimes, I'll make a half batch of the sauce and poor that in the middle of the loaf then add more biscuit pieces on top then cover the rest with the remaining sauce. Gives a nice little surprise in the middle.

One of my favorite recipes. These stuff is golden! Oh I could literally eat it all! I have found with my bundt pan that 2 tubes of Grands biscuits is sufficient, anymore and it would overflow the pan. Otherwise, I do not alter from the measurements in the recipe. My kids prefer it without nuts or raisins, although hubby likes it. So I make it both ways. This is delicious!

Soooo easy, and delicious!  The only downside is that it's only really great when it's fresh out of the oven.  It gets pretty soggy after it cools.  My husband eats it, but I only enjoy it fresh out of the oven.  I cut the biscuits with a pizza slicer, and my daughter rolls them in the cinnamon/sugar mix.  We don't shake them in a bag, we just put it in a bowl, and roll them.  She loves it!

Delicious! Halved the recipe, using 2 11.5 oz Pillsbury buttermilk biscuit tubes. Sprayed small rectangular loaf pan with Pam, sprinkled with about 1 Tbsp butterscotch pudding mix. Tossed rolled up biscuit quarters in sugar and cinnamon mix (doubled the cinnamon), and after adding half the biscuits I made the butter and brown sugar mix, and sprinkled raisins and about 1/4 of the butter mix onto the half of the biscuits already in the pan. Then added the rest of the biscuits, remaning butter mix, and more raisins. Baked for 30 minutes at 325 - 350 F on a baking sheet covered with foil, since it did outgrow the pan. Sweet, moist, flavorful, attractive, and fun to eat!

Excellent.  Easy to make and it turned out perfectly!  I added pecans.  Added the extra cinnamon sugar to the brown sugar mixture. Poured it throughout the layering of the biscuits.  My family loved it!

I scaled this way down because it was just for me and my two toddlers (who are 1 and 2 years old). They don't eat much so I just used one 7.5 oz can of biscuits. The glaze turned out weird for me, for some reason I couldn't get the brown sugar and butter to mix correctly. I've done it before for other recipes so I'm sure it's just something I did wrong. It still tasted good though. I cooked it in a pie pan. I left out the nuts because they're still a choking hazard around here, particularly for my one year old who doesn't have enough teeth to chew them properly, and I didn't have any raisins on hand, so those were out. The kids really liked it and so did I! I liked it a little too much and gave myself a little bit of a tummy ache. I will make this again!

Oh, the memories!! I hadn't had any monkey bread in years...my hubby and my daughter had never had it before. I was stoked to find this recipe because I had a can of butter flavored biscuits. I had to cut everything by a third on account of the one can. This was so good! Next time I'm thinking of putting some chopped up pitted prunes instead of raisins. I didn't do the nuts or raisins in this.

i might have a different opinion of this one's rating after i try another monkey bread recipe; however, after researching other recipes, this is the one that deemed most similar to my mama's. very rich! very sweet! exactly what monkey bread is (to me, at least). the only extra step that i added to my version is the dredging of the raw biscuit peices in butter before the cinn & sugar dip. i just remember thats how mr mike likes them.

I scaled this down and used only one tube of biscuits (each cut in fourths) in an 8-in round pan. It was more than enough for 3 people. It was so delicious.

Excellent and easy recipe. This is my first time making monkey bread. The flavor was very good. The only thing I would have preferred was probably to use a little less butter. I used 3 biscuit dough cans and also cut each biscuit in quarters. The presentation of this dish is very appealing. Great for finger food parties!

This bread is so yummy!  It is definitely not a healthy option, so we don't indulge very often, but when we do, our whole family is in the kitchen, waiting for it to come from the oven!

I made this recipe exactly and it turned out terrible.  Only the very top layer of biscuits were cooked, the rest were completely raw.  What was baked was delicious, but something went wrong with the recipe.

Well, we liked this a lot. I would not normally have made it except my husband kept pestering me and I did have several cans of biscuits that needed to be used. I used a Bundt cake pan (I am not sure how big)--I could only fit TWO cans of biscuits in, so that's what I did. This game me leftover cinnamon/sugar mixture, so I used it as part of the brown sugar mixture. That also worked out just fine. Thanks for a nifty recipe!

I only had one 16 oz package of Grands on hand but this recipe worked great nonetheless.  It's very easy to adapt as the allrecipes servings calculator makes it easy.  Even without that, this recipe is extremely easy and would be very hard to mess up.  We didn't add nuts or raisins due to picky eaters (I would have loved both).   A great summer afternoon snack for a hungry and energetic 8 year old boy.  Dangerously delicious if you are trying to avoid sugary snacks though!  I give it 5 stars because it was so simple and gives you a lot of bang for your time and effort.  My kind of recipe!

Such gooey deliciousness!  I did like the suggestion of other reviewers to make extra glaze to add after baking...all the gooier and all the yummier!

I've made other recipes before and thought this would be a nice change mixing the cut biscuits with the sugar mix.  Doing this did not allow the liquid sugar and butter to melt all the way through.  Sorry, won't make again.

It's so hard to not sit at the counter and pick off the top 'monkeys' right after this comes out of the oven, and if they weren't steaming hot and 375 degrees I would!

OMG.  Just like Mom used to make.  I added chopped walnuts and raisins in between layers of biscuits.  I also sprinkled each layer with a little extra cinnamon/sugar mix.  It was devoured by my family. Thanks OP for sharing.

This was amazing! My DH who is usually not a breakfast eater gobbled it up! I left out the raisins and nuts because I have a picky family and it was still amazing. I think I might take other reviewers suggestions next time and add some of the brown sugar/butter mixture in the middle and on top! I used two cans of grands buttermilk biscuits and it was the perfect amount!

This monkey bread was excellent, though I do have one thing to point out.  I have NEVER seen a 12 oz tube of refrigerated biscuits in any of the stores here in my area.  they are either 16.3 oz or 7 oz.  So I just used two and a half tubes of the 16.3 oz Grands Buttermilk biscuits.  Even that was a little too much, but I'll know for next time.  Definitely use a bundt pan, though...I even had a little spillage, but using a tube pan would be disastrous.  Great recipe! :)

Growing up, my mom and I made this with Butter-Me-Not biscuits, and took it on our beach camping trips.  I can't find those butter-me-nots anymore, so we just use regular biscuits.  We use our kitchen scissors to quarter them, and my youngest daughter shakes them in the ziploc bag, and layers them in the bundt pan.  Fun and easy!

The most Delicious Recipe!  I made this for Mother's Day Brunch and everyone raved.  I made this with Splenda white and brown sugar. I also used Reduced Fat Buttermilk biscuits. I drizzled icing over the top once inverted onto a plate. Better than Cinnabons!!

I lost my recipe for monkey bread so gave this one a try.  It was quite tasty but had a crunchy carmelized topping that my family had never experienced with monkey bread.  My old recipe was a soft bread throughout.

Made this for Good Friday brunch and everyone was wild about it.  Due to friends nut allergies and my daughter's strong dislike to raisins - both were not used however it did not affect the enjoyment of this recipe.  Thank you!  This will replace my Land of Nod cinnamon buns now.

Everyone loved this easy-to-make, gooey treat.  I followed the recipe very closely, minus the raisins, but found I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than stated.  Very, very good--lots of compliments.  Thanks for the post.

Great recipe - Definitely use a bunt pan.  I take it out of the oven and turn it upside down on the serving plate and let it sit about 10 minutes - this lets the gooey stuff drip down and it's fantastic hot!

I actually bought a 4-pack of biscuit dough and despite the warnings, I didn't think the pan looked full enough, so I used all four. It topped my bundt pan perfectly - no run over. Next time, I will make just a bit more sauce for it though. Nevertheless, this was easy and delicious and my 4-year-old loved helping.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!! I didn't have any 12oz cans of biscuits (not sure what type come in 12 oz?) so I used 4 cans of regular Pillsbury buttermilk biscuits (7.5oz cans) and cut them in 1/2. Came out fantastic!

I followed the recipe exactly and they were pretty good. My daughter had a great time cutting up the dough with a pizza slicer. The only thing I would do differently is to make a bit more syrup for the top as they were kinda dry and not gooey like I like them. I used 2 round pans sprayed with pam cuz I don't have a bundt pan and only baked them for about 15-20 minutes.

Fabulous recipe! My family asks for this at every gathering.  It is so easy.  I have my kids help cut the bisquits into quarters with a pair of kitchen shears. I let the pan sit for a few minutes after I take it out of the oven before I flip it onto a plate.  This helps the caramel sauce harden just a bit so it doesn't slid right off. Thanks for the recipe!

SO AWESOME and MUCH easier than previous recipe I had when my kids were younger and they LOVED it even more!  I used a silicone bundt pan - just watch for the flexibility.  They came out buttery and gooey and JUST PLAIN PERFECT!

Didn't have frozen biscuit on hand so used frozen bread dough.After I poured brown sugar+margarine mix added a little bit of milk to keep it moist while baking. It turned out very good and light.But I put in tube pan so ended up with a mess in the oven, should have read reviews closer. But otherwise an awesome recipe!

Three packages of biscuits were too many for the pan. Next time I'll try two cans. They were really good though. We made them on a family trip to the mountains with 14 people. They were gone in no time.

this goes quick every time i make it. the first time i used 3 tubes of biscuits, and i had to take off the top layer and put it back in. it was still gooey dough in the middle and getting too cooked on top. still tasted fine. the second time i used 2 tubes, and it came out perfect. i flipped it while still hot to let the caramel sugar drip all over it. used a bundt pan. mmmmm.

I have been elected by the family to make this every Christmas morning.  It is sinfully delicous!  It is a bit sweet though and I'm thinking I will try it with a little less sugar and see how it comes out.

This was UNBELIEVABLE!! I made it in the morning before work (so, in another words, it took me NO time) and picked on it on the ride over-- I couldn't resist! I put it in the lounge and an hour later it was GONE! Everyone loved it :) Next time, I would add cinnamon to the brown sugar/butter mixture because I really would like it to have more of a cinnamon bun taste.

This was my first adulthood attempt at making monkey bread (haven't done it since I helped my mom as a kid) and this recipe was just how I remembered it! I did, however, follow another comments advice and use a bundt. Thanks for such a great flashback to my childhood!

This was just too sticky for my family. I didn't see it noted in any of the reviews that I looked at but want to be sure people realize the Brown sugar mixture makes a caramel like coating that sticks to the the teeth. We did however enjoy the inside and want to experiment to see if we can bake without the brown sugar.

Very tasty. I put in down in front of a group of people with a paper attached to it entitled "monkey bread". When i came back, it was all gone and on the paper underneath the name someone wrote "more please". So it was a crowd pleaser.

I did change the dough from the buttermilk to cinnamon roll dough. I cut it up just the same as the recipe and still rolled it in the sugar with cinnamon I also did add one tsp of vanilla like someone suggested. I could not of asked for better.  Next time I am saving the iceing that comes with the cinnamon dough and spreading it on the top after I take it out of the oven.  I LOVE IT.

Dee-lish!  I made this for a Sunday breakfast with the family, and *everyone* loved it.  Even my brother (who hardly says anything) said, "Yeah, that's really good."  I used a bundt pan, and no raisins/walnuts.  I also couldn't find 12 oz tubes of biscuit dough, so I used a 4-pack of Pillsbury 7.5 oz tubes of buttermilk biscuit dough, and cut each biscuit in half.  I stacked the halves neatly in the pan, and tried to leave room for them to puff up.  I didn't let the pan sit for 10 minutes, because I couldn't wait that long.  The result was a delicious Monkey bread loaf in a puddle of gooey caramely goodness.  Again, dee-lish!  I will absolutely make this many more times!

Delicious! Everyone loved it! I cut the recipe to 5 servings, used 1 can of biscuits. Baked in an 8 inch round pan. Turned out perfectly. Even my fiancee, who isn't a big fan of anything sweet, ate it up. I think this will be our new Christmas morning tradition! Thank you!

I loved this recipe.  I used this reciped for Christmas gifts, and instead used 8" loaf pans.  I bought a bunch of the 4 packs with 7-1/2 oz. buiscuit cans and used 1-1/2 cans for each loaf pan and in it 3 layers of the prepared quartered buiscuits with chopped pecans sprinked between layers. Once cooled, I put on wax paper, then wrapped in clear cello Christmas paper! Great gifts from the kitchen.

Delish! I messed it up by adding too much butter to the brown sugar sauce and it was stll awesome. Diabetic coma-inducing, but sooo good. I made one third of the recipe in a baking dish (15 mins @ 350) since there were only two of us.

Made the recipe as is, without the optional nuts or raisins.  It was a huge hit at the party, and super-easy to make!  I used buttermilk biscuit dough (Pillsbury).  Next time I will try adding some pecans and raisins.

This recipe was so incrediabley easy, my children helped make this with no trouble. It's absolutely delicious. I didn't have a bunt pan so I used a large round pan,  and placed a cookie sheet under it in case of spills and easier removing from the oven. Even if I had a bunt pan I would have placed a cookie sheet under it for the same reason.

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. I tried another recipe somewhere else where you make the bread dough and it didn't turn out anywhere near as good as this one!! Five stars from my family.

Oh wow this is so good!  I used only one package of Grands biscuits and kept the measurements the same.  Put everything into a bundt pan, and with the single package of Grands, nothing overflowed at all, and the butter/sugar sauce was just the right amount.  I will be making this as often as my sweet tooth requires!

I live at altitude, so it took a lot longer to cook than the recipe states.  And it made a heck of a mess in my oven, so next time I will put something underneath.

A divided household on this one...my husband loved them, I thought they were ok, and my two year old ended up not being able to stomach them. We used Grands biscuits and some didn't get done inside. Also they were a bit too sweet and syrupy for me. Worth a try though, as they are quick and simple to make.

Very easy recipe with great results. I used 5 packages of 7.5 ounce buttermilk biscuits (not grand or jumbo sized) and just cut them in half. The "biscuit balls" only filled my bundt pan about halfway full, but after baking they were slightly puffing over the top, so, it 5 packages was the perfect amount! I baked the monkey bread for 30 minutes, then I let it cool for 5 minutes before flipping it over onto my cake stand and letting all the yummy syrup ooze down. Everyone loved this stuff! So addictive, it's REALLY hard to stop picking at it!

Wow!! What an awesome recipe.  My 11 year old daughter loves to make this recipe.  We have made this several times over the last couple of months.  It is delicious and does not last long at the house.  We use walnuts and a bundt pan, as I have read from other reviewers that the tube pan is a no go!  We have not tried pudding mix on the bottom, but may do that tonight.

Made it for brunch and the family loved it! I found using kitchen shear to cut the biscuits in quarters worked well.  Alterations: used butter instead of margarine, left out raisins and nuts due to family preferences.

This was so easy and it taste awesome!  I use a 9x13 because I didn't have a bundt pan or tube pan and it worked out great.  I didn't have to bake it quite as long, but I had to turn it on to a cookie sheet instead of a plate.

I used a lot of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and chocolate chips instead of raisins. I added the nuts also. I wanted to make it a decadent treat and it turned out really good. I also used a bundt pan.

OMG!  I love this recipe!  It is so simple and so good.  I had 3 little girls wanting a snack and decided this would be perfect.  I used a 5 count can of Grands biscuits and cut each biscuit into 8 pieces since they were bigger biscuits.  I used just a 9 inch round cake pan and this fit perfect.  Also, I only made half of the brown sugar/margarine mixture since I used fewer biscuits.  The girls loved it, but I think I ate the most!  Thanks for sharing and I will use this again and again.

Couldnt wait for breakfast to try this so my husband and I had it for dessert tonight. Followed others and used a bundt pan and used a plate to flip over during the cooling period. It was very good. We managed to save half for breakfast tomorrow.

My Monkey Bread came out so pretty that I was going to post a picture... but I never got a chance. 

I made it for a BBQ we had. It was GONE that night. I had inverted it, ran to get my camera and in the 1 minute I was away... HALF THE BREAD WAS GONE!

Next time I'll make it for my nieces. They'll LOVE that you can eat it with your hands.

Thanks for the sinful recipe ;]

We love this recipe.  It is so simple and the kids love pulling apart the bread to eat it.  My 4 year old helps by shaking the dough with the cinnamon sugar.  I do flip it over before it cools so that the sugar mixture seeps all the way through.  I also use a tube pan and have never had a problem with the sauce leaking as one reviewer did.

Excellent!  I accidentally opened the crescent roll dough instead of the biscuits so I decided to use it.  I made a third of the recipe and made them in 3 mini bundt pans.  I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts and only put raisins on one.  We liked the ones without the raisins better.  Overall, great easy recipe that you can alter to your preferences!  UPDATE: I did NOT like this in the bundt pan.  It seemed like it needed more goo and it dried out quickly.  If you make the large portion make sure you have the man power to eat it fresh -it just didn't taste the same later.  I'll stick to the smaller portions in the future.

Awesome recipe!  I gave each of my kids a bag with sugar and cinnamon, cut the biscuit with a pizza cutter and they coated the peices themselves.  We made this the first time on New Years day and again this morning for Mother's Day.  They felt like they made breakfast themselves for me!

My boys love this for breakfast. They also love to help make it...fun and easy. Best warm right out of oven. However we do skip the walnuts and raisins and pull it out of oven about 40-45 min, so center is doughy like cinnamon rolls. I also use an 8x8 square dish.

This was amazing...and even though I made some changes I would rate this a 5 for the inspiration. I sprinkled cook and serve butterscotch pudding mix in the bottom of bundt pan first as suggested by someone else and then I added 2 more tsp of cinniman to the sugar mix and used real butter to melt with the brown sugar. I omitted the raisons and nuts. Also used Grands homestyle buttermilk biscuits 3 cans, and they came out ohhh so moist and delicious.  First time for Monkey bread for me and my family and everyone just loved it sooo!

This is sooooo good. It is a great breakfast treat. We are a family of four and we eat the whole thing. I used a bundt pan and left out the raisins.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.

I used 2, 13 oz Pillsbury buttermilk biscuits. Each has 8 biscuits inside so I flattened each biscuit, sprinkles them inside and outside with the sugar/cinnamon mixture and then rolled each one up like a cinnamon roll individually. I sprinkles crushed pecans on the bottom of a bundt pan and then put in the rolled biscuits. The 16 biscuits fit perfectly in the pan and it came out beautifully but I was not into the saltiness of using buttermilk biscuits. They basically tasted like biscuits with cinnamon and sugar. It looked like a 5 star recipe (see my posted picture) but definitely did not taste as good as it looked.

I made this recipe for a potluck I was having at work. I made it the night before which is what I'm assuming was my first mistake... I actually made a double recipe and tasted it after it was out of the oven. Not very tastey in my opinion. It had a subtle salty/ sweet taste but other than that very bland. I woke up the next morning and it was hard as a ROCK! Needless to say, the monkey bread never made it to the potluck. I had to pick something up from the store instead. Overall, not a good experience with this recipe.

I will make this again, as it has a lot of potential.  I did not have a bundt pan so I used a regular baking dish, and it did not bake evenly.  I also thought it was a little dry.  Next time I will use a bundt pan and double the syrup.

I made this recipe for a family Easter Brunch and it turned out great.  Using a pizza cutter for the biscuits was brilliant, and a real time saver.  Everyone went crazy over it. I made the recipe exactly as written, except I did turn it over onto a plate as soon as it came out of the oven (like another reviewer suggested).  This allowed all of the sauce to run back down over it, mmmmmm.  This is definitely going to be a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is such a fun recipe to make, and a great treat to eat!!  (And it looks really pretty too.)  I think my niece and nephew will have a blast helping me make this - I can't wait until they're old enough to help in the kitchen (they're only two now, but I have big plans for them!!  haha)!  I didn't use raisins because my boyfriend and I are not big fans, but I did use walnuts and I'm glad I did!  The only reason this gets four stars instead of five is because I thought it was a LITTLE heavy on the butter / sugar topping.  (Granted, I don't have much of a sweet tooth.)  I'll try decreasing those amounts next time, but will otherwise make and enjoy!!  I think this will be a crowd-pleaser for breakfast or casual dessert.

This was really good - it reminded me of when my mom used to make it. It did seem a bit doughy in the middle like it wasn't quite done - next time I'll bake it for a few more minutes.

This turned out great as it was. I used dark brown sugar, sprinkled in the excess sugar/cinnamon between layers. I covered it in aluminum foil about halfway through cooking.. and I had to cook it for about 40  minutes and it was perfect all the way through. Great recipe, thanks.

Yummy!!! I was feeling unusually nice this morning, so I got up early and made this bread to share with my co-workers. The only changes I made, were instead of 3 cans of 10 oz. buscuits, I used 4 cans of 7 oz. buscuits, and I baked in a bunt pan. This was really easy, especially first thing in the morning. The "office vultures" gobbled this up quickly. I will make again for sure!

I had forgotten about this! I remember this from my childhood. I made this last night and my kids went nuts for it (and my Husband too!) Just some suggestions for others:
1. Don't boil the caramel sauce, it will crystalize..just bring it up to a boil and remove from heat.
Funny thing, I always remembered if you added nuts or raisins to monkey bread then it was called gorilla bread...This is an awesome recipe!

This was very good and easy. For those who have about as much cooking experience as I do, continue to stir the butter and brown sugar.  Whatever you do, don't leave it for a second because it will boil in about a minute.  Then...as sugar does it crystallizes and doesn't take all that great.

Great recipe.  I only had one can of the biscuits so I used that w/ a 9-in cake pan.   Enough for a side dish.  Baked it about 20 min.  I will definitely make again.

My 3 year old did most of the work with this recipe.  We made it for Christmas breakfast and it was wonderful.  When I pulled it from the oven, I thought it was underdone in the center but letting it sit for 10 minutes allowed to finish cooking without burning the bread on the top.  It is now our official Christmas breakfast.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe.  So easy that my husband made it all by himself.  He had tried a similar recipe at work that you had to let sit overnight so I came on All Recipes to find him something easier.  Since this one had rave reviews we decided to give it a try.  I will never go back to rolling out dough for cinnamon rolls this tastes just as good if not better, yet so much quicker and, did I mention easier.  If my husband can do it anyone can.

I used a bundt pan as other suggested and tried this out as a warm up before the holiday baking season. Wow. My Mother-In-Law wanted to know where she could buy monkey bread like this, and was stunned when handed the recipe from this site.

Have made this recipe several times now. I gave this 5 stars because it's inexpensive, easy, and tastes great. I cooked the sauce a little longer than a minute then sprinkled some of the left over cinnamon and sugar on the bread pieces and added the sauce to it in layers for extra saturation.  Yummy - this is a keeper. Will definately make again and again! Baking time was spot on!

This wasn't messy... i've used a regular 8" round cake pan, and a square 8"X8" cake pan and it has worked great both times. Really easy and good right out of the oven. It isnt great reheated, but usually there isn't any left to reheat.

Very good and similar to a sticky bun in flavor.  My family loved it, and my 4-year old had so much fun shaking the biscuits in the bag of cinnamon/sugar mixture. If you have a pizza cutter, make sure to use it with this recipe as it makes the cutting process go so quickly.  I scaled down on the amount of biscuits, but I kept the butter/brown sugar mixture measurements as called for so it was extra gooey!  I also think that it tastes better at room temperature than warm.  Will definately make again!

I made this monkey bread a REALLY long time ago, but I thought it would be unfair if I didn't come back and rate it.

Well, not really much to say. IT WAS DELICIOUS. That pretty much sums it up.

This was a Fabulous recipe. The only change that I would add, would be to boil the sugar and butter longer becasue the caramel was still a little grainy. Other then that it was PERFECT!!!

All I can say is... this recipe is freakin fan-tastic!!!!  I told my husband I was 'thinking' about making some kind of monkey bread and when I found this recipe and told him about it, the next thing I knew I was at the store getting the stuff and baking it.  My husband chose not to pick off of it, but rather to take chunks of it off with his fork.  I even loved it so much I told him he needed to get it out of the house or I would eat it all tonight-so it ended up at his work where it was devored in just a few minutes.  I made it exactly as the recipe states and have decided we can only have it at the first of the month since we can't moderate how much we eat!!!

Amazing, and a huge hit. For a different "leftover" version, spread remaainder into baking pan, add milk that is mixed with sugar and cinnamon to taste. Let sit in the fridge for a couple of hours, then cook for 15 minutes at 350! Voila: monkey bread pudding!

I also made my own tube pan, by using an oven-safe aluminum mixing bowl, and wrapping an empty soda can with tinfoil and placing it in the middle. Cheap and easy! Yayyy!

This was pretty good.  Took it to a Father's Day brunch and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I gave it 4 stars because, while it was rich and tasty, you could definately tell that store-bought biscuits were used.  I used Pillsbury biscuits.  I will make again though as it is a quick and simple treat!

This was the BEST!  My 10 y.o. cousin and I made this the other day.  She actually did all the work, I just did the stove work.  It was very very hard not to eat it before it was completely cool.  One note: make sure you use a pan that is one piece.  I made this again later, using my two-piece pan, and I got a lot of syrup that I had to burn of the bottom of my oven.  But still turned out awesome!

UPDATE: I recently made this for my coworkers and used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (1/2 cup) instead of regular brown sugar (1 cup).  It tasted practically the same and was gone before lunch time.

Very good! Used butter instead of Margarine and only had 2 cans of Buttermilk biscuts. Used same amount of other ingredients, except left out the nuts and raisins, delicious! Also used a Bundt pan as others suggested, will definately make again!

This was an awesome recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine and left out the walnuts and raisins and it still turned out great.  The aroma of the brown sugar and cinnamon is absolutely wonderful.

I've made this twice and have received many requests for the recipe.  Try it out 'cause I'm sure you'll like it.

I used cinnamon rolls to make it extra sweet.  Good tip to turn it over about a minute or two after pulling out of the oven to allow the mixture to seep all the way through.  Great recipe!

So simple to make... my hubby declared this "better than sticky buns!" I didn't use raisins or nuts in mine. Nothing fancy with this dish, just good old home cooking. Easy enough for little helpers!

This was good. I tried it with home-made biscuits and store-bought biscuits but the store-bought ones tasted better in this recipe and it also didn't stick together like the home-made ones.

Good flavor, but way too rich - and I LOVE rich foods.  I'd cut back on the butter and brown sugar next time and maybe drizzle a little bit of icing over the top.  Raisins were a good addition, but keep them to a minimum. Their flavor is a little overpowering.

I make this every Christmas Morning for my kids.  It is a family tradition.  I use kitchen shears to cut the biscuits into quarters.  That saves a little time.  Like others suggest, poor have the sauce when you have put half the biscuits in the pan.

This is delicious! I have not tried the other monkey bread recipes on this site, but I love the combination of the raisins and nuts in this one. I used pecans though. I made a plain monkey bread recipe before and it was not as good as this one.

Yum!  I used BUTTERMILK biscuits instead of just biscuits....It might have been a little saltier than it should have...but it is almost gone...so I guess it was good.I did not bother with the raisins or the nuts...it does not need it.

This was incredible.  It was even good the next day!  My husband said I could feel free to make anytime.  I added 1 teaspoon more cinnamon and left out the nuts.  Soooo good and easy to make.  I had no problem cranking it out for a 10:00 brunch and I have a 4 and 2 year old "helping".

I did use the suggestion of another reviewer who suggested layering the brown sugar/margarine mixture.  I used butter for extra richness as well.  We really enjoyed it!  I do think it could use a couple more teaspoons cinnamon.

This was soooo good!  I took one of the reviewers advice and put something under it in case it boiled over in the oven.  Like an idiot I used my baking stone which kept the first few layers of the biscuits from getting done.  I had to dump the last few layers out and stick the rest back in for a little while.  It still tasted wonderful and was a huge hit!

This was great! My mom made it when I was little and it brought back memories. It was actually better the next day. I just put plastic wrap on it and left it out.

Wonderful recipe- definitely use a Bundt pan- and put foil or a pan underneath because it will bubble out and over the side of the pan.  I left out the walnuts and raisins since my boys don't like them and it was a big hit!  Nice presentation and it was fun to make.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe!  I made mine with half raisins and half cream cheese - what a hit!  A little more time consuming than I originally thought (took a full hour to assemble two loaf pans) but the results were delicious!  The women at my church were so impressed when I turned the loaf pan over and the sauce just rolled down over the bread and on to the dish!

This bread is great-- it can be made even better if you use tubes of refrigerated crescent rolls instead of biscuits!

This was great and almost exactly what I remember my Grandma making when we were kids.  I used 3/4 c. of unpacked brown sugar and it was still very sweet.  I also had to bake it at least 15-20 minutes longer.  But, it was delicious and easy and made my house smell so cinnamon-y!!!

This recipe is so easy...I had my 3 yr. old son helping me. Not only did he have fun making it, he really enjoyed eating it! I gave it 4 stars because I felt that the cooking time should have been longer...the biscuit dough towards the center of the cake was still a little raw. I wish there was an easier way to check for the doneness of the biscuit dough without having to remove it from the tube pan.

So good. My husband was picking them off the top before I could tip it onto a plate. I halved the recipe and made it in a loaf pan since there's only two of us and it still came out great! We will definately be using this recipe for monkey bread in the future.

A winner for sure.  Made this morning and everyone loved them.  I did roll the dough in melted butter first to get a better coverage and I cut the butter in half and the brown sugar to 3/4 cup before pouring over the dough.  Baked for 30 minutes.  Thanks LuAnn

Pretty good - I used more cinnamon then called for and I dredge the balls in the butter mix before the cinnamon.  If I had not done this - these would have been really dry! Not bad!

This wasn't too bad.  My son didn't like it as much as he thought he would.  It was very sweet.  If I make again, I'll definitely cut back on both sugars.

Great recipe! I just made a few changes. My husband's grandmother used to make this, but I always thought it was dry. This time I dipped each biscuit in melted butter before shaking in tupperware. I also added extra cinnamon and we did add raisins. I couldn't find my nuts! It was delicious and hubby liked it better than moms! That's a winner!

I followed other posts and only did one thrid of the recipe in a round cake pan.  It was just enough for my family for an alternative to popcorn for watching movies.  I think I left it in too long, as the boiled mixture crystalized during baking and made it almost toffee-like.  The plate was still empty though!

I made a few changes and this came out FABULOUS! I upped the cinnamon to 1 Tbsp. and I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup(any more is too much!). I also used a can of reduced fat mixed in with the regular dough. I used real butter for better flavor, and I skipped the nuts and raisins. Everyone LOVED it! I served it with a cream cheese frosting on the side for dipping. Excellent!

Excellent and easy!  And great when half your family doesn't like pecans added, you just put them over what you want.  Easy for younger kids to help with, my girls cut the biscuits and mixed them in the sugar mixture while I cooked the butter & brown sugar.

It is really good when I had brought it out of the oven. You might wanna try and make more butter and brown sugar after you have put it in the oven to put on after it comes out of the oven or when serving. YUMMY!!!

Very yummy.  A little bit greasy though.  I wonder if you could cut back on the butter a bit.  Great recipe for a crowd.

I had something called monkey bread about 25 yrs ago and remembered it all this time.  Found this one and it came out wonderfully!  Also I used butter instead of margarine and I used a silicon bundt pan, which eliminated any sticking inside--anything that wanted to cling you just pop out cause the pan is flexible.  Everyone loved it and I'll make it again and again.  Thanks!

I, too, filled the biscuit pieces with cream cheese (I used a lite cream cheese spread), plus instead of raisins or nuts (yuck) I sprinkled chocolate and peanut butter chips throughout the pan. The result was delicious. I was afraid the cream cheese would make the flavor bland, but it didn't. In fact, it added a wonderful texture (like a filled donut, only less sweet). I'll probably never make monkey bread without cream cheese again!

An all-time favorite.  My oldest son brought this recipe home from his cooking class in jr high years ago.  Never tried the nuts or raisins, but they make a great addition!

This is a great recipe. I have never had problems with it sticking to the pan because I use no stick spray instead of grease or butter (it works perfectly)Also instead of blending the nuts and raisins with the dough, put them on the bottom of the lpan before you put the dough in. I use scissors to cut the dough. I also substituted pecans in the place of walnuts. It is fabulous!

This recipe is fantastic! Quick, easy, and delicious, it brought me back to my childhood when I would look forward to eating Monkey Bread at my aunt's house. The only change I made was the fact that I used pecans instead of walnuts. The second time I made this, I substituted all of the butter for sweetened applesauce. The result was fantastic, with much less guilt. Yummy!

This is the best breakfast ever!  I used flaky butter biscuits by Pillsbury and that really enhanced the flavor.  My mother-in-law loved it so much, she asked for the recipe and has been making it every weekend for everyone.  This one is a keeper!

This was pretty good! The only problem I had was I used grands biscuits and it took forever to bake!
 It stays soft for days when wrapped in plastic wrap and set on the kitchen counter.

Amazing! I used the Pillsbury cinnamon rolls. At the end I even spread some of the icing that came with the rolls on the bread for an even sweeter taste, not that it needs it!

I made this last night when I came home from work.  I wanted to make something my sweet-toothed, but picky-eater husband might like.  Well it was a HIT! He LOVED it, and on the plus side, it was fun to make.  I am sure I will be making this quite a bit.  Thank you LuAnn!

Love this recipe! Makes me a big hit with the grandkids!
I speed up the process by putting the biscuit pieces in a big bowl and tossing them with the melted butter. Then I add the premixed dry ingredients to the bowl, and toss it by hand, to make sure all the biscuits are separated. I use a 9 x 13 pan, which takes around 20 minutes to bake. When ready to serve, I cover the pan with tin foil, place a cutting board over the top of the pan, hold on tight and quickly invert.

I made it with 2 cans of biscuits. I cut them into 4's. Everything went well until I got to the sauce. I used butter as I don't use margarine. It didn't work together well at all. I baked it 30 mims in a bundt pan and the "caramel" hardened into candy ish type stuff. We picked it off and still had good bread.

Really tasty. I ended up with a lot of cinnamon and white sugar left over so I think it'd be fine in the future to eyeball how much coating I'd need. Quick and very easy recipe, it's hard to not eat the whole thing right now

For those concerned the recipe  warns against using a 2 piece tube pan for this recipe. A bundt pan or a single piece tube pan works really well.

Use a BUNDT pan !!!  And you don't actually have to take the time to cut up the biscuits, you can just pinch them into fourths.  30 minutes is enough time.

Was very easy to make & the family loved it.  We took for a Christmas morning snack, weren't allowed to take the leftovers home :-).  Guess will have to make our own.  Will be a keeper!

Excellent basic recipe for monkey bread however since some people seem confused.

A BUNDT PAN IS A ROUND PAN IN ONE PEICE WITH DECORTUVE EDGES THAT CREATES A HOLE IN THE CENTER OF THE CAKE

A TUBE PAN IS A BUNDT PAN WITHOUT THE DECORTIVE OUTSIDE

A SPRINGFORM PAN HAS 2 PARTS AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR LIQUIDY TYPE RECIPES (THIS, SCAUCED PUDDINGS ETC) AND ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS PUT ON OR OVER ANOTHER SHEET JUST INCASE

ADITIONALLY ALWAY ALWAY ALWAYS ALWAYS USE GOOD OVEN MITTS WHEN REMOVING THINGS FROM THE OVEN AND SUPERVISE CHILDREN WHEN BAKING

As is: #5.  I added a can of apple pie filling and everyone says it's over the top!  I am going to use only 2 cans of biscuits next time, so all gets coated better. This is very versatile as to what you want to add.

This is a new family favorite. We did it as a family, for breakfast this morning. My husband was skeptical at first but the minute he saw it, he dug in. That man looked me dead in my eyes with his fork at his mouth and said, “This stuff is dangerous.” And he was SO serious. I sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar on top for aesthetics and left out walnuts. Most definitely making this again!

So yummy and always a hit! Only downside is can’t find that size of biscuit cans, and only the outside seems to get the yummy brown sugar and butter glaze, the inside was only a little cinnamon sugary. Still very good just wish I had a side of the brown sugar butter glaze!

Made this for a breakfast brunch for last Christmas and it was a huge hit! Be sure it gets all eaten by your guests or you will not be able to keep your hands off of the leftovers! 
Very easy to make (I used just plain butter Grand biscuits, not the honey butter variety). I also used craisins versus raisins as we prefer their taste to raisins.

Monkey bread is a quick easy recipe and my family enjoys it as a treat sometimes for breakfast. Simple to make and delicious to eat and.....kid friendly tooo!! 
I make it in a bundt pan and sometimes I make it with two cans and leave them whole and dip each side in cinnamon/sugar and stand them on end around bundt pan. They bake up great with caramel on the outside and a spot to spread butter on .....yummy ??

So I’ve been looking awhile now for a chocolate cake recipe that can compete with the famous “mile high” cake served at the local restaurant. This one has been the closest so far! I followed the instructions to a T with the exception of substituting coffee for the boiling water. The cake itself was very rich and moist. The icing needs some work though. My gut feeling was that it called for too much cocoa powder. I went ahead and tried it anyways. Next time I will cut it back by about a third-half and go from there.

Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe! My daughter is 7 and  loves to bake, so we decided to make this recipe as written today before summer camp. It was a hit! Next time, we'll use fewer biscuits for more gooey sauce, but that's our preference. We used an 8x8 Pyrex pan (had a bit of an overflow in the oven...oops) and flipped the yummies onto a tray lined w/parchment paper, since we're a few utensils shy of a gourmet kitchen :) Now, I get to stare at this mound of cinnamon all day and try NOT to eat it...bwahahaha!

Amazing!! 2 of my older grandsons helped me make it on mother’s day. They demolished pretty much the whole pan. They weren’t sure how to start it so I told them to rip into it. I think that was as much fun as eating it.  It was a huge success. Will definitely make again.

So yum!!! I used a pizza cutter to make cutting the biscuits easier. Omitting the walnuts and raisins put the focus on the pure sweet gooeyness which was an added plus in ensuring allergen sensitive folks could enjoy as well.

No changes needed! Perfect. Easy! Delicious! Kids enjoyed helping me make this! We couldn't use the walnuts because my little girl is allergic but even without the walnuts it was delicious!

I would absolutely make this again!  It was so delicious and comforting!  We ate it while it was still warm and all I heard was “oh my!”  It’s very simple and inexpensive to make. This recipe seriously engenders a feeling of well being!  I love it!

Just a note—not ALL tube pans have two pieces—I have an older tube pan that is one piece. Sad unfortunate event (the child with burns) but in all fairness to whoever submitted the recipe-they may have had a one piece tube(angel food cake) pan and were not aware...

I had such an issue with cooking this. The center would not cook, had to throw it back in the oven 3 more times for it to fully cook and then at that point the outside was burnt. Next time, I’m going to cut them into smaller pieces, maybe it’ll be better.

Great recipe as written. Why make this if you don't want something sweet. As almost ALL the INGREDIENTS are SWEET. Didn't use nuts due to allergies in the family. Will be making this again....and again.

This is a great recipe.  I make it as written but also sometimes substitute Splenda for the sugar and Splenda and 1 tablespoon of molasses for the syrup.  This gets the carb count down to a level that my Wife (diabetic) can also enjoy this Monkey Bread. 
I make this a lot and get plenty of compliments on both versions.

My kid’s take turns making breakfast on Sundays. Today was my son’s turn and he wanted to make monkey bread. This recipe is amazing! We only used two cans of biscuits but kept everything else the same. He layered it - dough pieces, sauce, dough pieces, sauce. After it was done cooking we flipped it upside down so all the sauce would drizzle from the bottom to the the top. It was perfect!

Every time I make this recipe the goo drips out the top of the pan  making a mess. It also NEVER cooks through in the time suggested.  I have tried this recipe multiple times  adjusting bake time and/or temperature and it just doesn’t work for me.

Very good! Took off one star because when I followed the proper time, the whole inside was still raw. Had to mess up Christmas breakfast because I needed to pop it in the oven for 10 more minutes. Added crumbled bacon on the bottom of the bundt pan and it was delicious.

I use this recipe almost every weekend and it always turns out great. Make sure you’re using a BUNDT pan and not a tube pan. I use neither and use just a round cake pan and it turns out perfectly.

I did use a tube pan which came out perfectly without a drop of syrup spilled over. I layered the dough. Then butter/brown sugar. Frosted the top with cream cheese icing. Make sure only to layer about 1/2-2/3 of the way up the pan. Total winner!

Easier than I thought.  Only made one change.  I inadvertently bought Grands Biscuits as they were on sale and didn't realize my mistake until I was rereading the recipe just before making them.  I cut each into 6 pieces.  Omitted raisins but decided to toast the walnuts to bring out their flavor.  OMG, 2 pkgs of biscuits filled my bundt pan.  I used the 3rd container of biscuits in just a greased pie tin.  I did not need more of the other ingredients.  I baked for 35 min and think it was about 5 min too long, or I should have covered with foil for the last 5-10 of those as the top was a wee bit too crunchy.  Inverted beautifully!  I will definitely try adding berries next time as suggested by another reader.  Thank you for a great recipe I will be using often!

Great for the family.  I made this with refrigerated biscuits that did not contain dairy or egg.  My grandson with food allergies absolutely  loved it. I used vegetable oil margarine and no nuts. I will definitely make this for him again.

This is my go-to breakfast treat for my family. I use a four pack if Kroger buttermilk biscuits (see picture). 
*Using kitchen scissors will make prep so much easier. I do tweak the sauce. A very simple add makes a world of difference! 
For the sauce: Add a Tablespoon of cinnamon and make a portion and a 1/2 (see below)
1 and 1/2 stick of butter
1 1/2 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 Tablespoon of cinnamon
ENJOY!!

I basically stuck to the original recipe and it looks great.  I made it for an upcoming family gathering so I cannot say how good it taste just yet? However I think it will be delicious.

Super easy to make.  I used two of the grande packages of biscuits and it worked perfectly!  The Monkey Bread was taken to a tailgate brunch party for a football game.  When the college students appeared the Monkey Bread disappeared.  They loved it and thought I had actually made the receipe from scratch.

My first try was a failure only because the cook time should have been longer. Next time I’m going to cook for the 35 mins using only 2 cans of biscuits. At 35 I will check to see if more time is needed. When I flipped the bundt pan over it fell apart. I was sad, that’s when it was apparent longer cook time was needed. Lesson learned and I definitely will try again. The taste good though.

So easy, so good!!!

I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts, and I put about a third of the sauce in the middle of the cake (layered some of the biscuit, then a third of the sauce, half the nuts, rest of biscuit, rest of sauce and nuts).

Served pieces warm in a bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Everyone loved it!

Used JP Big Daddy Biscuits recipe from Allrecipe x 2. Rolled dough to 1/4" cut into 1" squares. Shook in sugar cinnamon in bag, placed 6 in each paper lined muffin cups, poured 1/2 tsp brown sugar butter mixture over tops of each muffin cup. Baked 350* for 15 minutes. Made exactly 48 baby monkeys.

Even tho I messed it up it still tasted great. I didn’t have enough biscuits so I added a tube of cinnamon buns, and because more is more I upped the brown sugar butter mixture. It is diabetes in a bowl but it was so good. I will make it again but this time I will follow the recipe

Cut recipe and made with one 16oz can and 1/2 all the other ingredients. Was good for a once in awhile sweet treat, when the regular "healthy"breakfast routine gets boring. When food is low before next check, it maybe more easy  to have this recipe's items on hand.

I used a bundt pan and inverted the monkey bread as soon as it came out of the oven. The only draw back is that it didn’t cook quite evenly and some of the caramel oozed out onto my oven :(

This is the easiest monkey bread recipe ever! I adjusted settings in the app for 5 servings (I only wanted to use 1 can of biscuits) and this was perfect for a loaf pan— NO dripping over the sides!!! Because I used less biscuits, my cook time was shorter at 24 mins. I did not use raisins and the nuts because I don’t like that stuff in my monkey bread. Otherwise, no additions to the provided recipe—it’s perfect as-is. My husband and I are eating in bed right now!!!

I think it tasted very well it was a very nice treat to make. I made some for my brothers and they just loved it, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a treat to store away. You can make it and store it away for any time you need something a little sweet.

Soooooooo good! I just wanted a little taste so I used approximately 8 frozen Pillsbury biscuits. Once they thawed, I cut them in quarters. I did add a splash of vanilla extract to my cinnamon/sugar mixture and I used butter instead of margarine. I also baked in 8x8 glass Pyrex pan on 350 degrees for 30 minutes. My 6 year old and I sat and ate half the pan before she took it away from me. She said it was so good we needed to make it once a week! YUMMY!!!

I used a 3 lb bag of frozen round rising yeast dinner rolls and it turned out great! I adjusted the recipe to 20 servings to account for the increase in rolls and I added some chopped pecans and a little vanilla and almond extract. Chopped these rolls into quarters and thirds to get some varying pull apart pieces in the bread. Yum.

I made it just as directed and it came out perfect.  Made it in a bundt pan and used two 16.3 oz cans, which is approximately the same as three 12 oz cans.

The only time we make monkey bread is Christmas morning.  The other recipe we usually make uses frozen bread dough (which is convenient for putting together the night before).  I decided to try this recipe this year and this is now our new favorite.  I wish I had read someone else's review first, but all we had in our store were the grand biscuits.  The middle pieces were undercooked.  Maybe these need to be cut a little smaller?  Our other recipe calls for butterscotch pudding mix so I may add this next year.  We have a houseful and they all loved it.  Thanks!

Perfect!  I followed Echo1272’s recommendations (butterscotch pudding mix/ pecans/ buttermilk biscuit dough) and our Christmas morning treat is just delicious!!! This may be our new tradition.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

In lieu of typical refrigerator rolls I substitute the refrigerated cinnamon rolls. Some of my kids actually using the icing they come with on the warm Monkey Bread, but it’s sweet enough without that for me. Absolutely yummy!

Will make again....and again! I made it the night before.  In the morning, as the oven pre heated, I took out the bundt pan, and started to melt the brown sugar with the butter., poured on the dough.  Then 30 minutes later husband wisked it out the door in a warm container, drove it to work, de panned it, and it was devoured...

Made recipe as written. Absolutely delicious and simple to make. It was gone in less than 2 days! There seems to be some confusion regarding Bundt pan vs. tube pan. A tube pan has straight sides and a removable bottom; it's also known as an angel food cake pan. A springform pan has a removable bottom, too, but the sides are much shorter. These are known as cheesecake pans. If the sides are fluted, then it's a Bundt pan and it does not have a removable bottom. I hope this helps.

The taste was great, but 3 tubes of biscuits rose significantly. I ended up with a lot of sticky caramel in the bottom of my oven. Quite a mess to clean up.

I followed the recipe exactly. I however, used Pam spray to grease the Bundt pan, mainly because of my concern that I wouldn’t be able to get the bread out. My husband enjoyed this and recommends making it again

This recipe is very similar to how I make it but instead of refrigerated biscuit dough, I will use same amount of Pilsbury Cinnamon dough.  My caramel sauce I use 3/4 cup butter to 1 cup golden brown sugar.  The rest of the recipe is the same, and delicious.  Always a crowd pleaser in our family :)

Ok, all of you that used the tube pan! Shame on you for being that stupid! When you use a new recipe, READ the recipe! THINK! If you know monkey bread you know it's gooey and sticky and will leak when hot! Unfortuntely there are mistakes that are made when putting out recipes so ALWAYS think before doing! This is a great recipe but, YES, use a bundt pan only!

It's a good recipe. I followed it exactly, except I omitted raisins. And I used a bundt pan. 

I don't know why anyone would use a tube pan. 

Everyone loved it for breakfast.

I made this on sept 2, 2017.
It was very good but next time I will cut down on the sugar in the mix that the biscuits are rolled in to 1/2 cup and add 1 large box of cook and serve vanilla pudding.

I already put in my rating but I failed to pay attention to the directions! I thought the recipe called for 2 cans of biscuits, not 3! I thought 2 cans were perfect. I could see the bread being more dry and not having enough of the syrup mixture going through if I had used more. I'll have to make sure I remember that modification!

Monkey bread is always good and this recipe is easy. I felt it had too much sugar. I would reduce the white by half or perhaps even eliminate it. The cinnamon is crucial and it needs the white sugar for distribution.
Also, I bought croissants instead of biscuits....by mistake....and the recipe turned out great!

So YUMMY and SUPER easy to make! I used dates and walnuts in mine. Had a LOT of leftover sugar/cinnamon so maybe I should have put more on the bits of biscuit, but it still tasted SO good. I used 2 GRANDS tubes and it fit perfectly in my bundt pan. I didn't boil the brown sugar long enough so it was a little gritty, but again, didn't matter because it was DELICIOUS!

Thank you for the wonderful, easy recipe, sure to make you the hit of any gathering.

This is a perfect recipe.  I never add anything, sometimes use 2 big cans of biscuits or 3 regular cans, it always comes out great

It's  a recipe I never make alone, always mom and kids together.  Everyone gets excited and crowds around the kitchen counter to do their part.  It is absolutely delicious, but I'm most grateful for the sweet memories my kids are taking from it!

This was very good! I omitted the nuts and raisins, and added a 1/2 package of vanilla pudding mix to the sugar mixture. The kids loved this on Christmas morning.

This couldn't have been easier and was so delicious!  I used two 16-oz cans of biscuit dough for 32 oz and it was perfect.  I also used butter, since I don't use margarine.  The bundt pan gave it beautiful presentation when flipped out onto a plate after baking.  Will be making these for a New Year's Day brunch.

Simple, easy, and delicious. We made this version in a round bundt cake pan after reading about others bad experiences with the tube pan. We just needed the basic concept of how to make it and we added more of everything to meet our taste. Will save and use as a reference again.

I made it exactly per the recipe and it's very very good.  I do agree with other comments that 3 cans of biscuits were too much so next time I will go with only 2 OR make additional brown sugar/butter 'syrup' to make it a bit more gooey.

This was super easy to make. I made this for Boss' Day and took it to work. I've had a lot of compliments. I added cranberries instead of raisins and added the walnuts for a little crunch. The only thing I may change is the brown sugar mixture and add more because the bottom of the dessert was drier than the top. Even after flipping it onto the plate there wasn't enough moisture to trickle down to the bottom.

Really good! I can not figure out how people fit 3 biscuit tubes in the pan?!  I only used 2 grands biscuits,  omitted raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Everyone loved it, been a favorite since I was little.

This was easy to make and the teens loved it for midnight breakfast after the school dance!  I had s bit of trouble with the first batch of the brown sugar sauce.  I must have cooked it too high because it started to get to soft candy thickening.  I dumped it and the second batch was fine.  Also, make sure to put a drip pan under it.  When the bread raised while baking, the sauce ran over.  Burnt sugar all over the bottom of the oven. Warning, it is very sweet.  Not a staple recipe, but fun for an occasion.

AMAZINGGGGG. I made this for a friend get together and it was gone 10 minutes out of the oven. Everyone raved about it!!! Some changes I made: used 2 16 oz can of buttermilk biscuit dough (32 oz. total) and this was the perfect amount of dough. Next time, I think I'll cut the brown sugar and butter mixture by half because the entire thing was way too much sweetness and it was perfect with just half. 
Also, don't make the syrup ahead of time because it doesn't remelt the same way (I tried this and don't make this same mistake!) - you can make the dough part ahead of time though. Really amazing recipe - highly recommend it!

I made very minor changes to the recipe. I made the exact amount of caramel mixture but only used about 3/4 of it. I think it was a perfect amount for the three cans worth. I realized some of the middle was still doughy so I put it back in the oven for about 10 minutes.   I didn't use raisins but I did use walnuts. YUM!

Best thing I've eaten in a long time. Instead of raisins and nuts, I peeled and cut an apple and added it. The entire thing was eaten by 4 people (one of which is a 2 year old) in a day. I'd love to make this every week, but my pants wouldn't appreciate it.

I've made it several times.  I don't ever use the nuts or the raisins, but I do add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Turns out great every time !

I melted butter and coated the dough pieces to make the sugar and cinnamon stick to it better. Loved that buttery taste!

Also, I made it in a 9x13 glass pan and it turned out great! (Just reduce the cook time by 5-10 minutes)

The girls I babysit over the summer and I make this every summer. It's an instant hit and tastes amazing! We used a bunt cake pan and had no problem. This is the easier recipe I've ever seen.

This is a great monkey bread recipe. Great for teenage girls to make! I don't change the recipe, and I've never had a problem with the pan- just turn it over on a plate before eating. only downfall is that it gets hard if it isn't eaten right away, which rarely is a problem.

Thank you to the lady that said her 7 yr old daughter loves this! I made it with my 10 yr old granddaughter Chloe and it was so much fun to make it together. The results were amazing and now my brother wants us to make 2 of them for his birthday and is making it with his grandsons today. Changes: Lots of kids don't like raisins so I used craisins and I didn't have walnuts so I used chopped pecans.

Flavor was good.. instructions were not! 35 minutes wasn't close to cooking it. We prepared as directed, and ended up with raw dough, and a lava mess all over the kitchen. It definitely isn't easy to put back into the bundt pan to cook for longer, not to mention all the good tasting syrup ended up on the kitchen counter and floor instead of the actual product. Not sure that we will try to make it again... if you do, make sure you cook for longer than directed!!

This was the hit of Sunday brunch.  We don't have a bundt pan so I made it in individual muffins.  There were only 6 of us, and my little muffin pans only took one roll of Pillsbury Grands.  I just eyeballed the sugar and cinnamon.  Use 1/2 of the brown sugar and butter called for.  They were perfect.  Next time I will make 12 muffins for the 6 of us....  People were wishing for more.  It took 15 minutes on 325 for the 6 muffins.  They looked beautiful.  Don't boil the brown sugar/butter for a minute.  It will get hard.  Pull it off as soon as it starts to bubble.

I only had two cans of biscuits the second time I made these and they turned out even better. Next time I will follow other reviewers and add a little vanilla.

This was my first time making Monkey bread, OH MY!!
This recipe is soooo to the point and simple.. I followed the recipe as noted but sorry I didn't add the raisin (NOT a fan of it in baked items). My whole family liked it, "do over!!"  The only thing I can add in my personal opinion is I prefer the chopped pecans, spread them throughout (to get a crunch in EVERYbite, yum,yum!!! The glaze comes out perfect I thought it would be too sweet,  nah just right...if you eat it while it's still warm your subjected to eating it all, if you let it cool, your subjected to eating it all..any way you look at it WILL disappear, you CAN'T GO WRONG with this one...this one is saved as a favorite.  THANKS!!!!

I've never had or made monkey bread and decided to try this recipe with my 8-year-old granddaughter this morning. I added about 1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans instead of walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe. Absolutely delicious! Will make again and again.

I added butterscotch pudding and substituted pecans for walnuts as another suggested. I also omitted the raisins. I didn't hear the oven timer and overcooked a few minutes and it still turned out wonderfully. Huge hit for Easter!

Fantastic!!! I only used 2 cans of biscuits because that's what I had on hand. I don't prefer nuts so I omitted that as well by choice. Otherwise A+ recipe, followed all other directions exactly and had a very delicious end result and it came out of the pan very well. Will make again!

Love, Love, Love it! The only thing is that I didn't want to make as much so I used one 12oz can of buttermilk biscuits but still used the same amount of every other ingredient, so it made a generous amount of sauce. I also baked it for 10 minutes less than the recipe says because I had less biscuits, so for 25 minutes instead of 35. I see a lot of people saying, "Don't use the tube pan," but like I said, I only used one can of the biscuits and I covered it with foil during baking just in case. It didn't overflow or spill at all. I added some chopped pecans instead of walnuts because of preference. Perfect! I will be making this many more times and adding it to my recipe book :)

VERY easy to make. I used 2 cans of grands biscuits (cut with a pizza cutter into 5ths) & I made it in a 1 piece tube pan. make sure to spray your pan well so it doesn't stick. I didn't think there was enough caramel sauce, but after it cooked, all biscuit pieces were covered in ooey gooey sauce. The top did get a little crunchy, but the rest was soft & moist. Every at our church dinner loved it!

This recipe is amazing! Super easy and super quick! I couldn't find my bundt pan so I used a casserole dish and put a metal funnel/tube in the center and it turned out great. I used craisins instead of raisins as my girlfriend doesn't like raisins, they have some infused with blueberry juice and which I highly recommend trying. Also used real butter (unsalted) which I felt gave it a richer flavor. 10/10 would make again.

YES!!!! Made this with pre made cinnamon roll dough from store! Made in muffin tin to bring to brunch so people could take their own little "muffin". EVERYONE LOVED IT!!! Zero were left. I used 4 tubes of cinnamon roll dough, 2 tubes ripped into dough pieces = 12 muffins. I made 24 total. I did an extra 1/4 of butter and 1/2 sugar mixture to pour over muffins. I also used pecans on the bottom so when they were flipped over they had a pecan top crust. I finished with icing drizzle. WILL MAKE AGAIN EVERYDAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

Major yummyness!  I couldn't find standard biscuits where I shop so ended up using Grands Jr.  Came close to overflowing the pan. BUT, it didn't and it tastes amazing!  No raisins (not a fan) but did use pecans.

A guy chiming in here: I left out nuts and raisins because my sons hates both. I used Bisquick because that is how I make biscuits. I did find Bisquick was great for this because you could make it a little bit sticky with a bit more milk and the cinnamon sugar stuck well. Also, I will make the Biscquick biscuits one batch at a time. Put cinnamon sugar in a bowl and rolled them then dumped on the sauce. Pretty easy and great for a cold Chicago Saturday morning.

Made this cut in thirds for a quick and easy dessert for the kids.  Kids love helping with this one and there is really nothing they can't do alone with a little supervision. This is our new go-to quick fix dessert.

No Bueno! Didn't turn out. The inside of dough was dry, and outside burnt. I may have cooked them too long, but can't figure out why the inside was dry. Too many biscuits? I followed recipe to a T Abd used bundt type pan.
I think I will try another recipe next time...

I made this for Christmas breakfast this morning and the whole family LOVED it! I followed previous advice and only used 2 cans of biscuits. Kept the rest of the recipe the same. It was delicious! 6 year olds and 66 year olds enjoyed it just as much!

Cut the recipe in half and made it in s loaf pan. The entire house smells heavenly. Next time I would add more cinnamon. Just really love it so my preference is s heavier cinnamon flavor.

I make this for dessert every couple of weeks. I would like to try it left over for breakfast, but my family never leaves any. I don't put in raisins though, I use peeled and chopped apples instead. Granny Smith is my preference.

Yum. This was so good. The first time I made it I added brown sugar with the white sugar by mistake, but it was still great.

I used one can of the Grands biscuits and cut into smaller pieces. It filled the tube pan almost perfect after baking. 

 I did follow another reviewers suggestion and lined pan with foil. I also let it sit 5 min after baking and flipped it into a small casserole dish so the glaze would cover it all.

I will be making this often.

No changes, but I will make extra sauce next time, and pour some onto the biscuits after I'm about halfway done. I love the sticky, messy, sugary goo.

Delicious, I made without the nuts and raisins. I used butter because I didn't have margarine. I used a bundt pan, nothing leaked over the top.

Made a double batch and added 2 teaspoons of nutmeg and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and used already baked yeast rolls.

 Melted butter and added white and brown sugars and added cinamon and nutmeg to sauce.  Broke up yeasts rolls into quarters (from top to bottom) and placed in a greased 9"x13" pan and poured sauce over top of roll pieces and baked in preheated 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.

I used a microwave and toaster oven to make a single portion of this. It took about twelve minutes (prep and cooking time) and was still amazing. I used a save a lot brand flaky, rolled pieces of one in the sugar mixture, piled them straight onto my toaster oven tray and drizzled the butter mixture on top. Voila!

I found this recipe to be very flavorful but a tad dry. I will try this again, maybe with a bit more butter. Also, I used walnuts but might try pecans next time.

My kids thought it was great. For me although a cake pan would not come out of the oven as impressive as a bundt pan version, I will use it next time because I didn't like that the brown sugar/butter sauce didn't seep down between the bread because it was so deep. Plus it takes a long time to cook when it is so thick.

This monkey bread was pretty good, but honestly, it wasn't as good as the Pillsbury recipe (found right on the side of the biscuit package).  The brown sugar mixture made the top too hard, and I think it would be better to use four packages of dough.

I just made this and it is good.  I did read how someone used a tube pan and it was messy but that was all I had so I put the tube pan on a cookie sheet.  Of course all the yummy brown sugar and butter mixture ran out so I will go purchase a bundt pan before I make this again.  Otherwise it was good.  I did not add the walnuts or raisins as I wanted simple.  Have to say not bad for my first attempt.  Hope to make it again soon.

Fixed these for my grandkids and they devoured them.  I didn't change a thing and did use a bundt pan.  Not one issue.

First, this was very good.  I only used half the amount of sugar and cinnamon for the coating only because I didn't think I needed all of it and it ended up being the perfect amount and I didn't have to throw out any of the sugar mix.  I like pecans better than walnuts so I subbed that.  I used 3 cans of the Pillsbury biscuit dough because I didn't have the fridge biscuit dough (and should not have).  Half way through coating the biscuits I realized that it might not all fit.  Needless to say, it baked and puffed over the pan and some of the glaze even oozed out.  Luckily I put a baking sheet underneath so it caught it.  I thought about squeezing the biscuits into the pan but was worried that the glaze wouldn't get through.  Mine also did not come out of the pan easily even though I greased it.  Despite all that, it came out yummy and I will definitely make this again - but with 2 biscuit roll things or find the refrigerated biscuit dough.

My kids devoured this bread! Loved it. I used a bundt pan cause I dont have a tube pan and 3 cans was the perfect amount only thing I didnt do was use the nuts due to my daughter being allergic. It was so good and sweet!! Was enough sauce.. This one is defintely something I will be making again and again.. I can see this being something I make every year for Xmas morning. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Loved this recipe! My 10 year old daughter and 8 year old son pretty much made the whole thing. We followed the directions without any adjustments and it turned out perfectly. My favorite part was watching my kids as they sat in front of the oven watching their monkey bread cook :)

shucks, I had high hopes for this recipe.  I should have just bought grands cinnamon buns.  The syrup not gooey, and hardened. At least I can take one off my list.

This is the first I've made this recipe and everyone loved it!! I did adjust the serving size to 10 which meant I needed just 2 packages of biscuit dough which was the exact amount to fill a Bundt pan. I, also, did not use raisins or walnuts and used butter instead. It was just as delicious. Definite keeper!!

This was super yummy but a little too sweet for me.  Easy fix though, next time I will use a little less sugar.

Beware---Can not eat just one!  This bread turned out better than the cinnabons at the mall.  Absolutely addicting.  Made it in a bundt pan with two packages of biscuits.  Cooked for 25 minutes.  Thank you, this is a hit with my family!

this recipe was wonderful! i was looking for something simple and delicious to make for my bf's family and they were very pleased. he requested me to make it, as we both tried it for the 1st time when we stayed at a bed and breakfast upstate NY.
i read several reviews and suggestions before taking this on. 
i pretty much followed as is, except i made balls instead of cutting the rolls in quarters and i made more of the brown sugar butter sauce and i poured the brown sugar sauce over each layer (there were 2 layers). it may be because i made balls, i made most of the 2nd layer, but didn't complete it. (it didn't make a difference in how the bread came out tho, see pics)next time i will make the balls more uniform in size. i used the honey butter and buttermilk biscuit dough. sprinkled raisins and walnuts on the bottom of the pan and throughout the layers. i used a srping form tube pan, put a baking sheet on the bottom rack while cooking and covered the bottom of my spring form pan with foil to prevent leakage. this method works but its probably easier to purchase a bundt pan. i also used tented foil over the bread for the 1st 20 minutes. i ate a piece fresh out of the oven and it was great but at the time it seamed like it could have used 5 more minutes of cook time but a couple hours later it was just perfect. i guess it depends on your preference and your oven. thanks for the amazing recipe!!
one last thing- i had a lot of cinnamon sugar left over i would divide it in half.

I only used 2 cans because I had the william sonoma 8 in monkey bread pan and I didn't want it to over flow. I kept the rest of the recipe the same and it turned out perfect, just like my mothers recipe from when I was a child. Not to moist but still sweet!

Fantastic! I'm kicking myself for not pouring the extra syrup from the bottom of the pan onto the bread before the pan cooled, though! SO good, you guys. You won't be disappointed.

I think the tube pan was an honest misunderstanding.  Some tube pans, like the one I have, are one piece.  This may have been what she meant.

Fabulous! I make a special brunch every Sunday, and this will be a regular! My husband loved it and can't stop talking about how good it was.  Loved the crunchy outside and soft inside. I used less butter, about 1/3 cup. I put the sugar and cinnamon in the baggie, but next time will put it in a bowl and roll the pieces. Also, I don't have a bundt pan, so cooked it in a glass pan and it turned out perfectly!

This was excellent! I modified the recipe to fit what I had: I used 2 cans cresent dough and 1/2 can pizza dough. I cooked in a 9in cake pan, and omitted the raisins and nuts. Came out wonderful!

Monkey Bread is a Christmas morning tradition in our house, and this is my favorite recipe yet. (We don't add the walnuts and raisins, though.) I'll be using it again this year.

Super yummy! Great to do with kids. I had a little overflow using the 3 cans so next time I'll use less.

I thought 3 cans of biscuits would be WAY too much, so I reduced the entire recipe by 1/3 and just used 1 can of biscuits.  WRONG!!  Now I understand that it takes 3 whole cans of biscuits to fill the bundt pan.  Follow my advice and follow the recipe!  This was a quick, easy and TASTY breakfast!!

This recipe was wonderful and DELICIOUS! I omitted the chopped walnuts and raisins and it tasted like a gooey carmel roll that pulled apart. My fiance loved it and wanted more. Awesome recipe!

The only thing I added was 1 tablespoon of Vanilla to the saucepan of brown sugar and butter.  It gives it a wonderful aroma and that extra something for flavor.  Everyone in the family loves it so much.  Thanks!

I made this for company and it was a big hit.  It takes a little bit to put it together coating all the pieces of dough, but definatly worth the time.  Next time I won't mix all the sugar and cinnamon together that the recipe calls for because I wound up throwing out quite a bit of it that I didn't use.

What Happened to My Monkey Bread?!?  Made this recipe a few days ago, and I have to say, I wish I could give it more stars, but something went wrong--and I know I measured everything, & followed all the steps, so I just can't give this recipe more than three stars until I get some feedback on what could have happened!  First of all, I coated all the pieces in the cinnamon sugar mix before arranging them in the pan, and then, I cooked the brown sugar and butter before pouring it onto the biscuit dough pieces. Here's what happened:  Upon coming out of the oven, the bread had a few issues; the big one being that the brown sugar/ butter mixture had failed to go anywhere but on the top and into a few of the first crevices between the little pieces.. Also, all those little pieces that were so lovingly and carefully fully coated with cinnamon and sugar mysteriously weren't anymore- it was as if the cinnamon/ sugar between a lot of them had simply disappeared..  So, instead of having this wonderful pull-apart concoction, I ended up with some sort of mutant (but great tasting, I'll admit) coffee cake... I had to cut it, since it had all but melded together, and that sort of defeats the purpose of all the prep to make it a finger food...   So, anyone  have any insight on what went wrong? Because, again, I swear I followed everything to the T!!

Great weekend breakfast recipe.  I have even used 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce in this recipe and it still comes out great.  A little less calories and fat, and gives it a little apple flavor.  My kids don't care for raisins or nuts, so I leave those out.  This is in our weekly rotation of Sunday Morning Breakfasts at our house.

I used to eat this when I was a kid and had completely forgotten about this gem. This recipe really brought me back. Excellent mother's day treat that will now be an annual tradition that perhaps will be passed on to my kids. So glad I found it!

I followed several review comments and this turned out great!  I only filled my bundt pan 2/3 full (used 2 cans of biscuit dough), and turned it on to a plate immediately to cool.  I also sprinkled in some chocolate chips while filling the pan.  Rave reviews!  Probably could have limited the sugar/cinnamon mixture for coating.

This was awesome and so much easier than making it from scratch. I followed one reviewer and flipped it out of the pan immediately. WAIT a few minutes at least. I had caramel sauce all over my kitchen counter. But it was still delicious and a big hit for Easter brunch!

Took this out of the oven a bit ago. Used buttermilk biscuits.  Snuck a taste....delish!  My co-workers are going to to crazy over this.  No nuts or raisins though....why ruin a perfectly sugary, buttery treat!

I followed the recipe other than using butter instead of margarine. Very good, although it was drier than I had expected , possibly because of the butter, or due to my unreliable oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved this.  For my pan I should have only used two cans of biscuits.  I used 3 and the brown sugar sauce ran over the sides and all over the bottom of the oven.  Also the middle was a little too doughy.  If I would have used 2 cans it would have been perfect.

My children (6 & 8) loved making this.  The first time I used four small cans of biscuits in a tube pan and it came out perfect. The second time I used three cans of "Grands" biscuits.  My whole family preferred the version made with the smaller biscuits.

an absolutely delicious, fattening splurge for a holiday treat! I didn't put the nuts/raisins as no one cares for them. Still they were DELICIOUS! definitley use a bundt pan. 2 of the kids want this as their bday "cake"

I scaled this back to 5 servings, so I only used one can of biscuits. We tore the biscuits into pieces, tossed them into melted butter then into a plastic bag with the dry ingredients, shook, and baked in for 20 minutes in a deep-dish pie plate. I also sprinkled the extra sweet mixture over the top and drizzled the extra butter. Delish!

MAKE SURE TO GREASE THE PAN VERY WELL!! I made this for Christmas morning. It was FANTASTIC!!! But I didn't grease it good enough and some of the pieces stuck. It was still amazing. I used the walnuts but not the raisins.

I make this for Christmas morning every year and we love it. I use one can of Grands biscuits and cut the other ingredients in half. Still have more than enough for my family of 4.     I also bake it the night before and warm it up in the oven on Christmas morning to cut down on my time spent in the kitchen away from my little ones.

YYUUUMMM!!! We used to eat this all the time growing up...it is soooo good! Instead of using refrigerated biscuits, I used a pound of bread dough. It's also very important  to let it sit for the 10 minutes after baking...I didn't because I was too anxious to eat it and flipped it onto a plate after 5 minutes and the butter/brown sugar just souped up on the plate...which worked out, we just dipped the bread pieces into it :)

This is fabulous! And so, so simple. I got up early on Saturday morning to make this for my hubby for breakfast and it was in the oven in no time. Really cheap to make too. I didn't use the nuts, but the raisins were a great addition. I think other dried fruits would be good as well. I am going to try dried pineapple and coconut next time for paradise monkey bread.

great recipe! i had the same problem several years ago with the burn issue...the gooey syrup stuff came oozing out and fell on my foot! that makes for a really bad burn...i second the notion that you should NEVER EVER use a tube pan for this recipe..only a Bundt.

This was yummy and the kids loved it!  It was so easy!  I added half a cup of chopped pecans.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars because it was too sugary for my taste.  Nothing wrong with the recipe, just my personal taste!  ;)

This was really good and so easy to make.  The only complaint I have is that I used way less than the cup of sugar it calls for and so I had to throw the rest away....but that is an easy fix.  Otherwise a wonderful recipe that I will definitely make again.

I scaled this to 5 servings (for 1 12-oz can of biscuit dough). I used Publix brand buttermilk biscuits, and baked them in 3 mini angel food cake pans (I lost some of the syrup to leakage out the bottom of the pans, but it was the first time I used them so I am going to have to figure out how to prevent that). I only had to bake for 15 minutes using the mini pans, so this was SUPER fast and easy for breakfast and delicious!! I loved the crunch the glaze gave the outside layer, and we used a sprinkling of walnuts in the middle but left the raisins out. My son thought these were awesome - great flavor and fun to eat! I had quite a bit of the cinnamon sugar mix leftover and thought about throwing that into the glaze mix and might try that next time (I like to try to stick to the recipe as its written the first time at least). Thanks for a quick easy and yummy breakfast recipe!

This is delicious! I really wanted to try monkey bread so I chose this simple recipe. It was incredibly quick and easy. Heed the warning about waiting for 10 minutes while it cools, the glaze is really hot. When you flip it out the glaze spills out onto the top and covers it. It's really good warm, but I cooled it to room temperature and took it to a get-together and it was devoured. Will make again and again. :) Thanks.

The concept behind putting the pieces in the sugar mixture makes it all the better!  Not my favorite type of breakfast, but it was still good regardless.

I cut the recipe in 1/3 (using only 1 tube of biscuits) since I was only making this for 2 people.  I followed the recipe exactly but added some chopped apple and raisins (mmmm!). I didn't have a tube pan so I made this in a bread loaf pan - bad idea, don't do it!   The middle came out gooey and uncooked while the outside was hard and crispy by the time I was able to get the inside fully cooked (the crispiness happened to end up being SO good and carmelized!)  Even with my mishap using the wrong pan this was DELICIOUS!  Next time I'll use a flat cake pan since I probably still won't have a tube pan and will probably broil the top to give the top a nice carmelized top again.

Great recipes my kids and husband loved it. Although I am not sure if I overcooked the carmel sauce so it was super thick and did not soak inside well even though I flipped the pan when it came out. Next time maybe double up the sauce and pour in between the biscuit layers.

I reduced the recipe to 5 servings (ratio for 1 can of biscuits) and they were delicious, except that for some reason they turned out very dry for me.  There was not near enough gooeyness.  I cannot figure out why though, as my husband is actually the one who put it together while I was doing something else.  He looked at the recipe again though and swears he didn't forget anything, so I don't know.  I'll definitely try again though.  The flavor was great!

I was looking to make something with all of the biscuits that I had gotten on sale at the grocery store. I'm glad I came across this recipe! I ended up having everything on hand, except I had the smaller packages of biscuits (I think 7.5, instead of 12 oz). I used those and instead of quartering them, I just halved them. I also didn't have the pan that the recipe called for - I just used a 9x13 baking dish, and decreased the time by about 5 minutes. Perfect! The only thing I would do differently, is to pour half of the glaze half-way through the layering of the biscuits to make sure they're more evenly coated. We're all fighting over who gets the top ones! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was so delicious!  I added 1 t vanilla and a 1/4 C milk to the butter/b. sugar mix.  I only used 2 cans of biscuits and poured the mixture between the layers.  I didn't want to buy a bundt cake for this one recipe so I made these in a pie pan instead.  Put foil on top so they didn't get over-cooked on top and baked for 20 minutes.  DIVINE!  I'm going to make a side of the frosting from the recipe "Clone of a Cinnabon" next time.  :)

This was my first experiment with monkey bread, and my brunch guests raved over it. I added raisins and omitted the nuts, but stayed true to the rest of the recipe.

The only reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars is b/c I think the butter and brown sugar mixture should go on after b/c it can stick!!!!! And we all know that burned sugar is Bitter!! But Loved the recipe!! Will MAKE again!!

This was delicious!  I only used 1 can of biscuits and 1/3 of all the other ingredients since it was just for my husband and me. I made mine in a round cake pan. I can imagine with 3 cans of biscuits layered on top of one another, the recipe would taste even better. :)

Hubby heard someone talk about monkey bread on the radio and asked me to make him some even though he didn't know what it was. I looked for a recipe using biscuits rather than from scratch and this was perfect. This is too rich for us to eat on a regular basis, though. From now on I'll save it for holidays and guests. Yum!

I made a 3rd of this recipe in a 8x8 square baking pan. The only thing I found was that there was more sauce then needed and that the sauce was a little grainy. I think maybe this was because I stirred the sauce a couple of times while it was boiling as I was worried it was going to burn.   Still it was excellent and devoured in no-time. I will make again for sure.

I was really looking forward to making this recipe after reading the reviews. I don't have a bundt pan so I used a casserole dish as many others had. Mine came out really hard and dried out on top. I cooked for as long as the recipe stated. The edible part had good flavor but a little too sweet for my taste.

Oh my goodness - so good. This was a huge hit at our Mother's Day brunch. It was gone after about 5 minutes! So easy, and a must-add to any family brunch. It's like a cinnamon bun on crack.

This recipe is a hit whenever I make it! I recommend using buttermilk biscuits and upping the cinnamon a bit. I also use a round cake pan and the recipe turns out fine (although probably not as pretty). My 2 year-old loves to help me make this. We just tear the biscuits up and then she shakes up the ziploc with the cinnamon/sugar mixture to coat them. I don't usually flip the recipe onto a plate - we just pull it from the pan. Love this recipe!

This recipe always turns out great! My 2 year old REALLY REALLY enjoyed it. I did not use the raisins and I subbed pecans for the walnuts. I will definately make this again. Thanks for posting :)

Used pecans instead of walnuts and flipped the bundt pan over a plate when it was done baking to let sauce drizzle down while cooling.  PERFECT!  The entire family gobbled it up!

My family absolutely LOVED this (as did the neighbors). I used the Amish White Bread recipe from this site, and then followed directions...the results were LETHAL! My wife says I can only make this once in a while, it's so addictive.

Awesome.  The only thing I did different was cook it for 25 min.  I guess my oven cooks hot, but it came out soft.  Perfect.

Super simple to do!  I added twice the amount of walnuts and gooey-ness to this and believe me, it was a hit. Next time, I will bake it a bit longer, make sure the walnuts go in first (so thay are on top when you invert this) and maybe add a bit of orange zest.  Really, it was delish!  We picked at it all day Easter Sunday and my Granddaughter wanted it for breakfast the next two mornings.

5 stars for flavor & ease ~ my 11 year old cut all the pieces with a cookie cutter & tossed them in the bag for me! I made 1/2 the pan plain & the other 1/2 with raisins & pecans (picky kids) & it was perfect.  I used a bundt pan & 4 small tubes of buttermilk biscuits (8oz?) & it didn't overflow...it was perfect!  Although I had read suggestions about drizzling some of the sauce in the middle, I made the recipe as stated & I'm glad I did because I think the caramel sauce in the middle would've been overwhelming.  It was great to pick a piece with caramel sauce...a piece with raisins & pecans...a plain piece in the middle with cinnamon sugar...so, that's the only problem I can find with this recipe: we couldn't stop eating it!  DELICIOUS!

One of my new favorite breakfast treats! A bundt pan works great. Like others mentioned, the bisquits do puff up quite a bit during cooking so be sure to take that into account to avoid possible overflow.

Really good! I used 2 cans of biscuits as others suggested and it fit perfectly in the bundt pan. I poured 1/2 of the sugar & butter mixture over half of the biscuits and the rest on top.

I made this last night just as written, to see if it is good enough to make for my associates at work.  And it most certainly is. Absolutely delicious. I ate about a third of it myself and had to give some away  before I ate it all. I'm single and live alone so I gave some to three of my friends.  They loved it too. I had never made or had Monkey bread before. Now it's one of my favorites,Thanks.

Yummm!!!  This was my first attempt at monkey bread and it turned out really good.  My kids had a blast helping me make it and my husband was delighted with such a treat.  Will probably adjust cinnamon/sugar to my family's taste, but overall great recipe! :)

MMMMMMMMMM!!!!Buttery goodness. I used 3 packs of 16 ounce flaky biscuit dough and I thought the cinnamon sugar was way too much for the amount of dough called for. Next time I will reduce that. I also substituted butter for margarine because I find margarine to be gross. I di not used any raisons or nuts and thought it came out great. It look fabulous!!!!Thank you for this yummy treat...this is also great for last minute company to serve with coffee.

I made this for my daughter and her friend, whom spent the night, for breakfast. They loved it and it was gone that morning. I omitted the raisins and nuts per the girls request. I snuck a few pieces and it was indeed very tasty.

I made this for the first time to give to some dinner guests. It was amazing and every body loved it. We wished we hadn't over dosed on the fajitas so we could've eaten more. I used the bundt pan and it was a gorgeous master piece for just a few minutes before we devoured it.

I had not made Monkey Bread in years and came across this recipe when I was trying to find something to serve for breakfast when we had guests.  It is amazing how good this is for such a simple recipe!

Three tubes of biscuits fit my bundt pan perfectly but found that this recipe was too bready and dry.  The outside was sugary and flavorful.  Have eaten monkey bread that was much more sugary and moist.

This recipe was awesome!  I made it for my family on Christmas morning and they all loved it.  We're adding it to our traditional Christmas egg bake breakfast.  The only thing I changed was I didn't add the raisins or nuts because most of our children do not like those.  But all of the rest of the ingredients worked out perfect!  It came right out of the pan and looked beautiful.

Made this for Christmas morning.  It was fabulous!  Every bit as good as my homemade cinnamon rolls and way easier!  I used the "cheap" refrigerated biscuits and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make again!

This is very good and super easy.  My only complaint is that the recipe makes a huge amount.  We ended up throwing half of it away because we couldn't eat it all.  But it was very good.

This recipe was PERFECT! The best part is that the kids all got to help make them. One would hold open the bag while the other would use scissors to cut the biscuit into four pieces dropping into the bag then shake. It was lots of fun to make and even more fun to eat. Thanks for sharing!!!

I haven't made this yet, however my mother did and it was to die for. She added the nuts and raisons, which made it better. Also, she took the suggestion of another user, and used frozen yeast rolls in place of the biscuits. It was wonderful and I'm not sure how my mom pulled it off, but it looked like something off the front pages of a fancy cooking magazine. I can't wait to make it (and eat it!) I just hope it turns out as good as my moms!!

I cannot believe that in my nearly 40 years on Earth that I never saw this recipe before!

This was sooo easy and sooo delicious that I expect to make this with every excuse I can make - family gatherings, kids parties, etc.  I really enjoy cooking complicated recipes to test my skills and people do appreciate the effort as well.  I will never admit how easy this is.

The one minor thing I did different from the recipe was to use Pillsbury biscuits with butter already in the biscuit.

Mmmm, good and goey! I used splenda with cinnamon for the dusting part and baked in a bundt pan. The only problem I had was the biscuits in the center bottom never fully cooked so we just plucked those off and threw them out. The first time I checked for doneness, I could tell that some sections were undercooked (not my oven..it is used extensively for baking) so I popped it back in, then th top was overbrowning but the inside was still underdone. I think I would use just two cans of biscuits next time, it makes a huge amount of Monkey Bread anyway.

Monkey Bread is absolutely amazing.  I actually gave the recipe to my brother the other day, thinking it was a family secret of my in-law's!  The only thing different in our recipe is 2 Tbsp of Karo syrup in with the brown sugar and butter.  Just helps make it stickier!  Yum.  I use a bundt pan as well, but if I'm taking it somewhere where I won't be getting my pan back, I bake it in a 9x13 pan and then flip it carefully into a disposable aluminum pan.  Doesn't matter if if flips nice, still tastes the same!

These were a huge hit for Christmas morning!!! I made 2 pans of them, one I added chopped pecans to...YUMMY!  I also did not put them in a tube pan, I put them in a pie pan for easy stacking!  I wouldn't recommed stacking too high as the middle won't cook as well and the top and bottom will burn.  THESE WERE WONDERFUL~

I know I'm in the minority, but I was not entirely happy with this recipe.  It came out very dry, and the outside was very crispy.  I made it in a non-stick bundt pan, which I had sprayed with Pam, and it still got stuck in the pan.  The inner parts were more moist, but overall I felt this was not the best Monkey Bread I've ever had.

I make this every Christmas morning and it is always a hit!  After coating all of the biscuit pieces, there is usually a good amount of sugar/cinnamon mixture left so instead of it going to waste, I pour the remaining mixture on top of the dough before adding the margerine/brown sugar. It makes it extra gooey and yummy!

Very easy and yummy recipe. The only reason it did not get 5 stars in the brown sugar/butter mixture clummped up when it cooled.  I think I may have needed to boil it a little longer. But the husband gobbled it up.

Sorry to disagree, but my sugar caramelized and was way too sugary to eat. I might try it again with some modifications.

The recipe tasted great.  I made if for a brunch with my in laws.  The only problem I had was that it wasn't baked all the way through and the top was burning.  I just took the burned pieces off before I put it on the serving tray.  It was a huge hit!  I will make it again for sure. It is a great recipe for kids to help.

Awsome recipe! So easy to put together, the house smelled wonderful while it was cooking and my daughters couldn't stop MMMMMMMMMM-ing. Nice presentation too, we set it on top of a cake plate. This is definitely going to be part of our Christmas Brunch celebration.

This was good, but a little to sweet for my family. I will make again just with about 1/2 the brown sugar and butter mixture.

I scaled the recipe down to use one package of biscuits and serve 5. I baked it in a loaf pan and it worked very well. I prefer monkey bread over cinnamon rolls because it takes a lot less time to make. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so YUMMMY! I made it last night for my kids and husband and we all loved it. I took the advice from other reviewers and used a Bundt pan and added vanilla extract and heavy cream to the sauce. I want to start a tradition with this bread and make it on Christmas mornings.  Thanks for the recipe.  Definately a keeper!!

I made this for my Bunco party.  It was such a huge hit.  Actually it didn't even make it to the dessert table.  The girls were picking at it all night and sadly by the time dessert came around the monkey bread was gone and nobody had room for any of the other desserts.  =]  Everyone went home with the recipe!!  Thanks for the post!!

Awesome!    What a great recipe to make for a brunch or breakfast!  Used buttermilk Pilsbury Grands (2 cans) I didn't use the nuts but I did add raisins.   I made this about an hour ago and my husband already ate half of it :)  Definite Keeper!  will make again.

Phenominal!  I didn't add raisins or nuts because my family doesn't care for them.  I added 1/2 packet of butterscotch pudding to the sugar and cinnamon mix, based on another reviewers suggestion.  Part of the middle of mine stuck to the bottom of the pan, next time I will make sure there is tons of pam all over the pan.  I can't wait for my husband to get home to smell and taste this recipe.  I'm sure it will become a holiday/special weekend treat!

Delicious!  Everyone loved it.  After reading other reviews I used Grands Buttermilk biscuits, but I think I will use the original next time because of the flavor.  I only needed two canisters of the grands also.  I poured half the brown sugar mixture over them and covered it and put it in the oven for 15 minutes and then uncovered it and poured the rest over and let it bake another 25 minutes.  It came out soft and flavorful.

Wow! Yummy! This was a great recipe. I followed a few suggestions. First, I did use buttermilk biscuits. Secondly, I used pecans instead of walnuts, which was wonderful. And thirdly, I used butterscotch pudding on the bottom of the pan before putting in my cinnemon and sugar covered balls. I used a dark metal Wilton bundt pan sprayed with 'Bakers Joy' to prevent sticking. I served this as part of a brunch for my twins baptism and it was gone instantly! I will definatly make this again soon!

This is absolutely delicious! My boyfriend took one bite and said "You have to take this away from me immediately or I will eat the whole thing!" 
It looks pretty as well. Cutting the dough with a pizza cutter made it quick and easy. Thank you for a great recipe!

Instead of 3 tubes of 12 oz dough, I used 2 tubes of 7.5 oz dough.  But I kept the other amounts the same because I like a lot of sticky sweet goo on my monkey bread.  I used a 1 1/2 quart round glass casserole dish to bake this in.  It didn't boil over at all.  My whole family loved it.

5 Stars for being yummy and easy.  I only used one BUTTERMILK bisquit can and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  I only had a glass dish to bake them in also.  I didn't realize the middle wasn't done until I flipped it over on a cookie sheet so I had to stick it back in the oven for about 12 minutes...still turned out great!!  My kids and hubby loved them!!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe.  A neighbor introduced me to this bread and it's wonderful!  My kids LOVE it!  I've never tried putting in the raisins or nuts until now so I will definately try that next time!

These are just like my grandma used to make.  I do recommend putting a cookie sheet underneath the bundt pan so all the sticky stuff doesnt drip in your oven

I had to rate it 4 instead of 5 because it isn't the healthiest food I have ever eaten, but this monkey bread is great!   I used an 8x8 pan, and it was wonderful!!  I used slightly less brown sugar so it wouldn't harden like others have said.  I was able to reheat this morning for breakfast, it was great! Even my husband, who doesn't like sweet things, enjoyed it.  Thanks for introducing us to Monkey Bread!!

It had a good taste but the glaze was too much. It hardened w/in minutes and could nearly pull your fillings out. 
I gave it 3 stars because its a good idea and it had good flavor but I will not be making again.

Delicious!  When I was purchasing the biscut dough, I was scared that using a buttermilk dough would make the whole dish taste strage but there are enough other flavors that you don't even taste it.  Very filling but you can't stop eating it.

What can we say...who dosen't LOVE monkey bread? We made 2 batches; one with the traditional cinnamon sugar glaze and one with a powdered sugar icing. Both were spectacular, but tasters preferred the traditional glaze!

I tried Monkey Bread V and this was way better.  Sugary, though.  Might be better to lay off the brown sugar a little.  So dripping good, though, we had to make ourselves stop eating it.

Monkey bread is always a hit. Add a few drizzle of honey before baking to get the gooey carmelization.  MMMMM good!  Add cream cheese and sugar/cinnamon sprinkle in the middle of each biscuit pieces for a yummy surprise.

This recipe was delicious. I don't know if I boiled the brown sugar syrup too long or not long enough because after it baked it looked like regular brown sugar..not very syrupy..lol. But it was still good.

Love this recipe.  So easy to make.  I don't know if my bundt pan is small, but mine was quite full with two cans of biscuits.  I used Splenda for the white sugar, and toasted slivered almonds instead of walnuts--much better!  I drizzled the butter/brown sugar and some of the almonds between and on top of each of the three layers in my bundt pan.  Baked for 35 minutes, making the top a little crispy, the inside nice and soft, like a cinnamon roll. Absolutely delicious!!!

This monkey bread is absolutely divine! I took a few of the other reviewer's suggestions, but I wish I jsut stuck to the original recipe. this recipe certainly does NOT need more topping- it would be perfect as written. Next time I'm following it exactly! I cooked mine with unsalted butter since I used buttermilk biscuits, which tend to be salty already. I arranged mine in a glass 8" x 11" pan and it cooked beautifully. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe. (I am sitting at the computer now with a plate full of bites!)

No one can believe this uses canned dough! I've made this for a party and a family get-together and always gotten rave reviews. Suggestions: I like to add 1/4 tsp of ginger to the cinnamon and sugar bag. You won't really taste the ginger in the final product, but it will enhance the taste of the cinnamon. Also, DON'T use a tube pan with a separatable bottom, as other users have mentioned the syrup gets all over the place and burns. If you're using a regular pan instead of a bundt pan, I've found that anything more than one layer of dough pieces will keep the center from cooking.

Everyone loves this recipe, you can't go wrong - especially for kids.

My husband requested some monkey bread one night and I knew just where to go.  This was so easy, my 5 year old helped me roll the biscuts in the cinnamon sugar and place them in the pan - we had fun and then the finished product was amazing, my husband and daughter created a monkey bread dance and all was right with the world.  Make this recipe!

This was ok. The reason why I didn't love it was because of the way the butter/brown sugar tasted after the bread cooled. It tasted very grainy even though I boiled it a full minute, and overpowered the entire dish.

Wonderful! The only changes I made were: I used 3/4 of a stick of margarine, and I flipped the pan over on a plate right after I got it out of the oven. Everyone loved it!

I'm giving this 5 stars because I screwed it up and it still turned out.  I used one tube of Grand's buttermilk biscuits and cooked them in a 9x5 loaf pan.  I didn't cook the biscuits long enough so they were slightly doughy, and burned the butter/brown sugar mix though didn't know.  It still tasted great, so I'll make again and fix the mistakes.

I am so happy to have found this recipe! A friend of mine used to make this for all of our school parties where we had to bring in something to eat and I haven't been able to find the recipe until I stumbled across it on this site :)  P.S. My boyfriend is addicted to it!!

This was really awesome! The only thing wrong with it was that i ate too much! Next time i make this recipe i will try to use the frozen Bridgeford white bread instead of the refrigerated biscuits.

I am a newbie when it comes to cooking =) But this recipe was easy and fun to make. I made it for some friends about two hours ago and it's almost gone!  I used buttermilk biscuits and the bread came out moist and delicious, not the best looking but this gets 5 stars for taste alone.  Delicious!

This was really good, my family really enjoyed it.  We had it for breakfast on Easter morning.  I was suprised at how long it took it to cook (35 min, and even then it was a little doughy), but I know what adjustments I need to make next time.  This was just about as easy as it could be.  Give it a try!

Wow, sinfully delicious!    I have never made this before and it was fantastic.     I used a bundt pan and followed the directions above.    I didn't put any sauce in the middle and glad I didn't, it was sweet and moist enough.      Very tasty!

This is always a great treat, but I used frozen bread dough instead of the biscuits. It is healthier (although minimally), and just seems to be lighter tasting to me.

Great! I used 2 cans of bisquits in a 9x9 glass baking dish and reduced the brown sugar/butter mixture a little.  Really great!  My husband says a keeper.

We just made this, and everyone loved it!!! I followed the recommendation of turning out of pan as soon as it came out of the oven..very nice... i used a tube pan, with a pizza pan under it, (I saw the post about the brown sugar & butter dripping on oven and racks...will definately use either cake pan or bundt pan next time. I also added a bit of nutmeg in the cinnamon sugar mixture...We will definately use this recipe again. Next time will try adding apples and pecans, instead of raisins and pecans.

Oh my GOD!! Amazing! I will make this over and over and over again. I used two biscuit things and used a small square glass baking dish. I also let it brown nicely and then covered with foil so it would cook through. I also heated the butter and the brown sugar together in the microwave until it was all bubbly. Mmm Mmm Mmmmmmm delicious!!

I baked this in a 14 x 2 round cake pan.  It fit all 3 biscuit rolls and looked beautiful when it was done.  It took approximately 15 min to cook.  It was easier to separate to eat and it didn't get soggy with too much syrup.

I too made just a bit more of the sauce than was called for.  Used half of it half way through the layering of biscuits.  Let it set out of the oven for just a few minutes before I flipped it on to a serving plate.  I made this for my oldest son's going away brunch on New Years day.  EVERYONE LOVED it!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made monkey bread for the first time Christmas Day and it was very good. I didn't include raisins. I recommend placing half of the biscuits in the bundt pan and then drizzling with half the sugar/butter mixture. Then follow with the rest of the biscuits and mixture. I used more cinnamon than listed and used white sugar instead of brown sugar. Instead of melting the sugar with the butter, I mixed the sugar in 1 1/2 sticks of melted butter and it worked fine.

Excellent monkey bread! I omitted the nuts and raisins because my family doesn't like them and it was still wonderful. I agree with another reviewer that it could use more brown sugar/butter mixture over the top. We had family over for New Years Eve and everyone loved it. We will be making this more often!!

Wow...this was too good for words!!  My boyfriend calls it the "cavity finder!!" But he loves it just as much as I do.  Our friends ask me all the time when I'm going to make it again....and why would I tell them?  I want it all for myself!!!

This was soooo YUMMY! It was only my daughter and i so we only used 2 cans of biscuits, the small cans and used a round 9" pan. And also added some of the leftover sugar mixture to the butter and brown sugar while cooking. Even though we only did two layers of dough it still rose above the pan! This was excellent and will definately make again! Thank you!!

This was a hit at our family Christmas party. Used Texas Buttermilk biscuits. Warm out of the oven and everyone was grapping apart the pieces. Was the best dessert over sugar cookies, fudge, etc.

I guess this was good!  Just wasn't too impressed.  Sure, I'd make it again.  But I'm open for a better recipe.  I omitted the raisins too.

My family loves this recipe!  The recipe calls for only 3 tubes of biscuits, but we use all four and there's plenty of caramel to compensate for the extra dough.  Every Christmas and Thanksgiving morning we have this recipe.

I've made this a couple of times now, both with very positive feedback. The only changes I made is to use butter, as margarine does not exist in my house, and to omit the raisins as I don't care for them. I love the cinnamon/sugar mixture however and this definitely stays in my recipe box!

Most excelent.My Mom made this bread whin
I was a child an way beyond,at first from
scratch,then to biscuts.I too use a bunt
pan,also whin I take it out of the oven I
let set for a short min.thin flip onto a
platter,the sirup should cling to the br-
ead,an not run all down on the plater,but
still yet yours was fantastic,a great hit
with the kids this thanksgiving.
                  Thank you again.

We had never heard of monkey bread before.  Everyone really liked it!  It turned out perfect and was fun and easy to make.  I also used butter instead of margerine and used half walnuts and half pecans.  Thanks for the great recipe and the good tips about turning them upside down out of the pan when slightly cooled and using the bundt pan.

I made this Monday night as sort of a trial for Thanksgiving. Used my husband and roommate as my guinnea pigs, and let me tell you... they loved it! My husband will eat just about anything and all I can get out if him is "It's ok." With this monkey bread, I actually got a "Holy !" I'm really excited to try this recipe on the rest of the family! Thanks!

Oh my goodness this stuff is so good!  The only complaint I have is that it was so good that I ate too much and got a stomach ache!  I used a bundt cake pan to make it - next time I will use a regular tube pan.

This is an excellent, quick recipe that my children really enjoyed. The recipe calls for 3 12 oz cans of biscuits. I used 4 7 oz cans and didn't cut them. It worked out well. I baked it in a 9in round cake pan and I had to bake it a bit longer. Next time I will try a bundt pan. I also made icing and let those who wanted to ice thier pieces.
Thanks for this quick and delicious recipe!

Fabulous!!!  My family couldn't stop raving how great it was.  My husband thought it was the best breakfast item I had made in the 19 years together.  It reminded him of a warm doughnut.  Have made it twice since.  Also, great to make with your kids.

Despite the many five-star reviews for this recipe, it was far too sugary and grainy for our tastes.

Delicious!  My kids love to help make this.  However, the only problem with it is you need to eat it when it is first made, by the next day it was yucky and we threw the rest away.  But right out of the oven it was awesome.  I will make this again.

This is the best monkey bread recipe (and easiest) out there! It turns out every single time. I don't bother with the nuts or raisins, and I use 1/2 of the white sugar/cinnamon stated. You don't need that much just to coat the little yummies.

Yummy, yummy!  This was soooo easy to make and eaten up quite quickly!  Cinnamon-sugar mixture could be cut in half, and we left off the raisins and walnuts, as my kids don't like 'em.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Love this recipe! So good and easy.  My kids and hubby couldn't get enough.  The only things I did different was left out the raisins and nuts and added a scoop(3/4 c) vanilla ice cream in the end, remove pan from heat, and stir until melted, then pour over dough.  So delicious!!!

This was very easy to make and quite delicious.  My kids thought it was too sweet, but after letting it sit for about an hour, even though it got cold, it tasted perfect.  My friend didn't even know that I used store bought biscuits, but I could taste the difference.  Still yummy and quick!

Ok peeps, heres what you do if you do use a tube pan instead of a Bundt.  I dont have a Bundt pan so I lined the bottom of my tube pan with foil and then added the middle insert.  I had no mess this way.  I sprayed with nonstick spray.  Used 2 cans of Grands Biscuits.  Cut the dough with a pizza cutter.  I used butter instead of margarine and added vanilla.
This is a very good recipe but rich!  Adding it to our breakfast rotation!  Thank you.

Sooo goood. I took it to work for breakfast and my cooworkers went for seconds and thirds. It was gone in heartbeat. My husband wanted it to be sweeter in the middle, so next time Im going to pour some butter/sugar sauce in between layers and try to use some cream cheese as some other reviewer suggested. Im making it again soon.

I made this the other day and it was gone in a heartbeat! I made it in a normal round cake pan and it turned out just fine. Oh! Also, I used honey butter biscuits - I would definitely recommend them.

I made this for breakfast this morning and did the recipe wrong (that's what I get for skipping ahead!).  I ended up mixing the brown sugar with the cinnamon/sugar and springled a fair amount of it over each layer.  Then I poured just the melted butter over the top in the end.  It still came out fantastic!!!  My kids had 3 helpings!

I made this for a brunch bridal shower.  It was a HIT!  I used the same portions as the recipe calls for.  There was quite a bit of white sugar and cinnamon mixture left over.  I probably could have added another package of biscuit dough.

This is the best monkey bread recipe!  I've also used pillsbury bread loaf dough (lower in fat and calories) and no one could tell the difference!  YUM!  When can I make it again?!

This is WONDERFUL! Since I found this recipe just 2 weeks ago, I have made it 5 times!
My kids love it! My husband loves it! 
My 8 (soon to be 9) year old daughter is going to make this next year for 4H!
I even made this for the kids for an after school treat!
I NEVER have any left overs!
Just be careful when flipping it out...It can get VERY messy!  But it is So worth it!

Tried this -- everyone gave it 2 thumbs up! I thought that 2 cups of sugar (1 white, 1 brown) were a little much so I cut it back to 1/2 c each. Still really sweet and to die for good! Thanks for the recipe.

My stepson and I made this yesterday.  We are both sweet eaters.  We enjoyed it but both thought that it was waaayyy sweet.  That is unusual for us.  We will probably make it again, but  somehow control the sweetness.  Don't know if we will cut down on the brown sugar, or what. Also, I used real butter and left out the nuts and raisins(not a fan of either).  Really good.  Really sweet.  The ease of the recipe is nice and the aroma while cooking is wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and easy to make.  My toddler loved shaking the pieces in the sugar mixture and then placing them around the pan.  I also layered the sugar sauce between layers

Yummm!!  A huge hit each time I make it.  Only problem I have is getting the inside cooked through without the edge pieces over-cooking.  Last time, I just pulled the bottom (hard) layer off before serving.

We love these at our house. We're not real picky when it comes to monkey bread. I did use a thawed loaf of frozen bread dough as that is what I had. I just cut off little pieces and dipped them. Let rise in frige overnight and brought to room temp before baking in the am. They are very tasty. Oh and I didn't have the walnuts but that's okay cause they were still very yummy!!!

Delicious! One Problem- the topping comes off. Maybe because I didn't make it in a loaf pan but a casserole type dish -Who knows? There isn't a better recipe for monkey bread, that is this quick and easy. THANKS!!!

These are also good if you roll a Hershey's Kiss in each of the bisquits before dipping it in butter/sugar/cinnamon. YUM.

This was so easy and so scrumptious. Instead of using a plastic bag, I mixed the sugar, cinnamon, raisins and biscuts in a large mixing bowl and arranged them in the tube pan.  The melted butter and brown sugar was a little to sweet for our taste, so next time I make this, which my kids told me will be next weekend, I will use a little less brown sugar.

This is a classic recipe everyone is sure to love.  It's also simple enough to let the kids assemble.  My daughter's, now 9 and 11, have been making this on their own for a few years now.  I let them use the microwave to melt the butter and brown sugar. They don't like raisins so we leave them out.  We have also made it without nuts with great results. Be very careful not to over bake this.

Very easy to make and my husband loves it too.  A friend suggested soaking the raisins in rum or whisky I think I will give that a try sometime.  
This will become a family favorite.

This was SOOOO good!  The sauce that you pour on top runs down and pools on the bottom.  It tastes wonderful!  It reminds me of a caramel sauce.  We had some friends over and they all said it was killer.  Thank you for sharing!

Perfect Christmas breakfast! Easy to make and a big hit with the family. I spooned the brown sugar/margarine between layers. I also added chopped pecans. Thanks for sharing this great keeper of a recipe.

Pretty good....made some changes though. I used 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 c. brown sugar and 1 tblspn. of cinnamon, 2 cans of buttermilk biscuits and one stick of melted butter. This was a yummy treat....but not as sweet as I thought it should be. Next time, I will increase the white sugar, use flakey biscuits and keep the rest of the ingredients as I used. Loved the concept of just pulling the gooey pieces off one by one!! Thanks LuAnn!

I had this once as a child and remembered loving it.  I made it for my children a couple of weeks ago using only 1 can of biscuits and they went crazy.  They have requested it again tomorrow morning for their sleepover breakfast!  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I don't know anyone who wouldn't love this.  I used two cans of flaky Grands because that is what I had on hand.  Cut each one into 6 pieces instead of 4 and then followed the recipe exactly - including bake time.  So easy, pretty (I used a bundt pan) and delicious. Thanks Luann for sharing!

I have been looking all over for this recipe. My mother used to make this when we were kids! What a yummy treat. I did however have to throw it out after the first night becasue I ate too much of it and I did not want it around to mess up my diet. It was soooo good I could not control myself!

My daughter and I really enjoyed this.  I grew up on Monkey Bread but have never taken the opportunity to make it until now.  I only had one large can of biscuits so I scaled it down.  I let mine cook a little to long and some of them came out a little too brown, but were still good nonetheless.  This made a quick and yummy late night snack.  Thanks for sharing.

SOOOO yummy, just like cinnamon rolls only much easier and quicker to make! I can't wait to make it again and have my 2 year-old help me, I'm sure she'll get a kick out of shaking the biscuit pieces in the bag. I think I'll try nuts in the next batch, too. Think I might go get some more...mmm!

This recipe is so easy and so awesome.  My family could not bring themselves to stop eating it. I used a bundt rather than a tube pan for a bit prettier presentation.  No matter how it looks, the taste is outstanding.  A definite keeper.

Yummy!  I used applesauce for half of the butter to make it less fattening. It took about 45 minutes to bake.  I will make it again.

This recipe was scrumptious.  I only used 2 cans of 10 count butter flavored biscuits.  I flattened them out very gently by pulling rather than pressing down, wrapped each one up with a small cube of cream cheese and a half ts of cinn sugar in the middle.  After tossing each ball in the cinn sugar mix, I sprinkled the remaining sugar on top of each of the balls after placing in pan.  Made it a lot more caramely and gooey.  Yummm...

This was a lot of fun to make. My son enjoyed shaking the biscuits in the Ziploc bag with the sugar and cinnamon and placing them in the bundt pan. Clean up is a breeze. Just throw everything back into the Ziploc bag!

Yummy! I made this bread on Christmas morning having never made it before. I found it to be very easy to make. It tasted wonderful and will become a traditional Christmas breakfast item in our home. We were still picking at it throughout the day because it was so delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

This was not as sweet as I had anticipated. I used Pam in my bundt pan and only 3 pieces stuck in the bottom. Next time I would make more of the brown sugar and butter syrup as my family did not feel there was enough. I did find that eating it hot was best since it became hard when it cooled.

This recipe is so easy and fast, that my 12 year old daughter can do it with no problem, and it is fun to do together.  The best part is that it is so delicious and can be personalized with so many combinations of nuts or dried fruits.

Fabulous recipe!  Super easy and quick!  My 2-year old daughter LOVED helping roll the dough in the sugar.  I didnt have a bundt pan the first time I made this, so I used a Pyrex bowl, and it worked just fine.  The second time I used a bundt pan and it was just as good, only a little prettier!

Good recipe - the only thing I did differently was omitted the raisins (didn't have any in the house at the time).  My only complaint was that it stuck to the bottom of my tube pan, even though I had greased it.

This is so easy & tasty!  My husband wants me to make this all the time.  I would probably use less of the butter/sugar combo next time.  it was a little too much for us.  Great recipe & would definetly make again.

Here's what my 7-year-old has to say about this recipe: "I helped mom make this monkey bread because it is fun to help in the kitchen and it tasted really good! It's my favorite monkey bread."

I was trying to find a recipe like my grandmother used to make.  This sounded similiar.  It was easy to make and my kids enjoyed cutting up the biscuits and shaking in the bag of sugar and cinnamon.  We really didn't like the finished bread.  It was too sticky and too sweet.  It was more like caramel rolls not cinnamon rolls.
