I used pretzels instead of chow mien noodles and this turned out super cute and delicious! Will likely make again in the future. A big hit with the kids!

Super cute and easy.  I used the noodles but broke them up quite a bit before adding the marshmallow mixture.

Delicious, cute Easter brunch treats! I added a dollop of melted chocolate in the nest for that chocolate peanutbutter flavor.

We added some melted chocolate to the inside of the nests so the eggs stayed put and to sweeten it up a bit more. We also placed a little peep on a few nests

This is great. Taste is wonderful. Nests are a little difficult to shape. Next time think I would break the chow neon noodles up a bit smaller.

Made this recipe with kids aged K-6th grade. Very easy and the kids loved it. We have used chow mein noodles, pretzels (crushed) and Chex cereal (crushed) for the dry ingredient. We skipped the peanut butter and added 1/4 c butterscotch chips to the marshmallow mixture. Make sure to grease the muffin cups generously as well as the kids fingers. The finished product is adorable!

This was easy to make and came out so cute.  I actually got to taste one since I had a few extras and it was pretty yummy.  I gave them as Easter presents to all of my nieces and their significant other.  They loved them!  AND they are all in their 20’s

These cookies are very cute but they only taste "eh."  I think I would prefer to use rice crispies or corn flakes. I did add a little vanilla extract to improve the flavor.

Really cute.  My friend and I made them together.  She had bought a bag of really fine noodles and my were quite big.  Choose the finer, easier to work with cuter.
HELPFUL HINT:  Coat your hands with oil and before each next run you hands under water and gentle pat dry.  If you don't do this?? Good Luck!

I made it exactly according recipe and it was a hit with my guests. I had trouble forming the nests by hand so I resorted to muffin tins which worked out perfectly.

Hard and flavourless. No one ate them - wouldn't make again. IF you just want them for decoration, then they are fine.

Cute and fun - and quick (I didn't use peanut butter)! And I shaped them into 5 larger nests.

Modified review after second attempt: Cute as decor but WARNING the nests could be inedible - use noodles with “pan-fried” or “steam-fried” on the package. If you can’t eat the noodles straight from the package, don’t use them. I also like the suggestion to use pretzel sticks instead of chow mein noodles.

Use pretzels instead of chow mein and break up the pretzels and this was easy and all loved it. I made this for the kids but the adults raved.

Very cute but not very sweet.  I would add some sugar or white corn syrup next time (or use my ranch cookie recipe of sugar/corn syrup/pb.)  The nests were a little tricky to form.  I wish I had followed other tips for breaking the chow mien noodles up a little bit and/or something to make everything stick together a little better.  But they are very cute.

Super cute.  Don’t forget to butter your hands before forming nests.  I shaped the nests and put them in a buttered cup cake pan to cool and hold their shape.

One of my Easter desserts.  So easy and sooo cute.  With marshmallows, peanut butter and chocolate what could be more delicious! 
May use a few less marshmallows as the can of noodles wasn’t quite  3 cups.

I thought the kids would really like these . I was wrong. The noodles were their real complaint. Next time I'll use Rice Krispies.

I made this with my 3 year old. She loved making the nests and also enjoyed eating them. I don’t love the flavor (might be better with pretzels?).
I also used a muffin pan to for each nest and found that a bit easier (I did make one by hand because mine made 13 nests).
