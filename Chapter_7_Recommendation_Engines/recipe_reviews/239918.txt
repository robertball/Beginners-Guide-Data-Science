Since there weren't any comments or showing of anyone else making, followed the directions exactly as written.  I waited 40 minutes (instead of 45) to check with the "freezer" method and it was done.  Did not use pectin either.  Made 3 x 8 oz. jars and 1 x 12 oz. jar.  Will be making more, Thank you Art for a great jam recipe
Update:  After giving the jam time to "breathe" tried it and will be making a couple of changes:  1.  use 3 1/2 cups of white sugar (instead of 4) 2.  "boil" 35 minutes.  Reason is too sweet and too tough (will make it again )

I followed the recipe but when it got cold it turned in a solid hard candy like stuff, did I do something wrong? I don't know how I am going to get it out of the jars now unless I can microwave it. it might work., it would work for a candy for Christmas or just to eat. like a brittle,

I'm guessing I had my temp too high. In 20 minutes, it lost all of its liquid. My SO called it apple pie marmalade, but it wasn't even that. It was very tasty, but the wrong consistency.

I ran out of white sugar while preparing the second batch, so I used Demerara sugar and brown too instead. The result was as good as using the white sugar.

4 cups of white sugar made it way too sweet. I'm making a new batch now with only 2.5 cups of white sugar and 1/4 of light brown sugar it already taste so much better. 
I also added 1 more tea spoon of cinnamon as I'm doing it for Christmas presents and now the jam tastes more christmassy. I read in another recipe to add a bit of cognac.

Haven't consumed all of it yet, and I might have gotten some of the spices/ingredients slightly off in terms of flavor profile, and I used darker brown sugar than the recipe called for and probably cooked it a bit long, but it tastes really good regardless.

This recipe tastes AMAZING! It does take a while to peel, core, and finely chop the apples but I think it is worth it.
