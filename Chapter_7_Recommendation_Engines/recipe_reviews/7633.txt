I made this for a large party. I made the cookie layers and froze them for 2 weeks.
The day before the party I put it all together. It was absolutely wonderful. No one would ever
guess how it is made. Even though people were stuffed with food, they made room
for this. It might be the best dessert I've ever made. Next time I would put it 
together a couple of days in advance because it got even better as it seasoned. I
think the cookie layers would freeze forever, and I froze the left overs for a week. 
It was great when defrosted. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I made this for dessert for Christmas dinner at my sister's house.  I made it about 30 hours ahead of the time we served it and it was wonderful.  I did have a bit of difficulty getting seven 9" cookies out of the recipe, but I was able to make it work.  Next time I might try 8" cookies instead.  In any event, I followed the recipe exactly, except I did use half low-fat sour cream and half regular. I also decorated the serving plate and the top of the torte with sugared cranberries and green decorating frosting to resemble holly berries and leaves.  Pretty on the "snow" of the powdered sugar.  This got raves from all, and I personally loved it.

Don't turn away from this recipe because you think its difficult! It is not! The dough is very easy to work with. I cut out parchment circles slightly larger than 9 inches. I also used a 9 inch paper plate as a guide. I baked 2 at  a time on the cookie sheet. This does taste better after 2 to 3 days in the frig. Very impressive!!! Should be more than 5 stars!!!! I have made it twice this week! Thanks a million Brenda!1

While NOT my favorite dessert- it's gotten rave reviews around dh's office many times. I'm making again this week- definitely a keeper. 
It IS alot of work- I started rolling parts flat to a dusted cake pan bottom and just trimming around them to save time...

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. The hardest part is rolling out the layers, because the dough is so stiff. I found that the last portions I rolled out were easier, because the butter had softened some; and I also found it helpful to press out and shape the dough with my hands before using a rolling pin, just to keep the edges from cracking so much.

I loved making it! I didn't expect to be baking for 3 hours straight though, just keep that in mind so you aren't keeping the family waiting for their dessert.  I kept a slice for 5 days though and it was really gross by the 4th day so I recommend either keeping it in the fridge until then or not leaving it out.  Loved the recipe and will keep on baking it!

I entered this in a sour cream competition at the Iowa State Fair - you had to use 2 cups.  I made it as written, but substituted pecans.  I received 3rd place out of 20 entries.  When I passed samples, the volunteers in the food department raved about it!

Too much work for "so-so" results.  Difficult to cut and equally difficult to eat.  The filling was good, I think I'll try to use the filling in a different recipe.

the torte tastes like a cross between pecan pie and those little danish butter cookies. If you like either of those, you'll LOVE this dessert. Making the cookie layers was a little difficult because I don't have a cookie sheet without edges. So I rolled out the 9in circle on wax paper and then slid the whole thing onto the cookie sheet and baked it that way; worked really well. After making the cookie layers it was very easy to assemble. The longer you let is sit in the fridge the better it gets. I'm the only one in my family that likes sweets, and when I divided the torte among friends two weeks after I made it they still raved about it. I definitely would make this again. I'm thinking about making little sour cream torte cookies using a cookie cutter and fewer layers.

This recipe is amazing! I made six, 8-inch cookies instead, and that was plenty. I used the ring on my 8-inch spring form as a "cookie cutter" so all the layers would be uniform. I was about 1/2 cup short on sour cream, so I added a couple spoonfuls of whipped topping to the filling, and used pecans instead of walnuts. I left my last cookie on the pan too long, and could not get it off without crumbling, so my top layer was crumbled cookie pieces instead of a giant cookie. It looked so pretty this way, that I will do it again! I found that if I took the cookies off the pan after letting them cool for about two minutes that they were still pliable enough to remove with out breakage. Like other reviews said, it is good the next day, but even better the third and fourth! It is easy to cut, and the pieces hold up well. It is also one of the prettiest desserts I've seen. Especially when sliced. Fantastic! Thank you for sharing this Brenda. (my photo is the one with the crumbled top layer. I took the photo before dusting with powdered sugar, it looked even prettier after.)

I've waited over 24 hours for the torte to meld and become delicious but it just isn't.  It's like one big, wet sugar cookie.  Sorry.

This is easy to make and had an unusual but unique shape when I got through with it! We liked it, and I'm sure it'll be even better tomorrow (:

This cake was awesome, my family loved it.  Sadly no leftovers! It was a bit time consuming, but well worth it. I will make it again soon.
