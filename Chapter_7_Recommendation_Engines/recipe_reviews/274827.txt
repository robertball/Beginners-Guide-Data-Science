10.27.19  Really enjoyed these potato wedges.  I did add a little salt and pepper and bumped up the hot sauce to suit our taste preference.  I checked for doneness at 30 minutes, and they were browned up nicely and cooked through, so Iâ€™d suggest you take a look sooner than 40 minutes.  Served today with Sweet and Spicy Sriracha Aioli on this site which made a great dipping sauce.  I certainly can see these wedges as a side dish, but they'd also be a great item for Game Day snacks.
