These are amazing little tasty bites. and so easy to put together.  Just the right size for an appy, brunch or cocktail party.  I did use the Manchego cheese, which is a little pricey but well worth it.  I am sure another semi-dry cheese would work just as well though.

I bought Mexican Chorizo and it did not look like the chorizo in the video -- it was soft and in a plastic casing that had to be removed.  Therefore, I cooked it in a pan with the potatoes and didn't need to use any olive oil.  I also didn't have the tiny muffin tins so I used regular sized ones.  And, I didn't have the right cheese -- I only had farmer's cheese oacked in brine.  Since the cheese was in brine, I didn't use any salt and since the chorizo was really hot, I didn't add any cayenne pepper.  It turned out fabulously and I increased the cooking time to 20 minutes to allow for the larger muffin tins.  For garnish, I mixed avocado, tomatoes, garlic, lemon juice, green onion and salt together and served it with sour cream as well.  AMAZING!

I wish I could give it 4.5 stars.  The only substitution I made was for mild cheddar since I lived in Germany at the time and Manchego was non-existent in that market.  These are really easy to make and last on the serving tray for several hours since they are best at room temperature.  Serve them with some hot sauce, sriracha, sambal, or my favorite, tomatillo salsa (green salsa).  They are great leftover chopped up in breakfast tacos or burritos.

Have made this several time as written. It was very good. Now I have adjusted it slightly. I added a 4 ounce can of diced Jalapeno peppers. It gives it a nice kick. I have taken them to church functions and they are always the first to disappear. Will continue to make these.
Note Spanish and Mexican Chorizo are different. Spanish is more the consistence of Pepperoni where Mexican is softer and tends to melt in the pan.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for several reasons. One was because it was very easy to make.  I had some vegetarian chorizo in the freezer, not completely knowing what I was going to make, then I saw this recipe and thought it would make a wonderful brunch dish along with a French toast bake from this site also.  I opted to use regular size cupcake pan for more of a meal. But the appetizer size would be the perfect party treat.  The only ingredient I added was a little chopped onion, cooked with the chorizo and a meal we had.  This recipe is extremely versatile, which added to it appeal. Try and stay close to baking times. Eggs have a tendency to dry out and become tough when over cooked.

These mini quiches were adorable and delicious! I used 1 regular sized muffin tin and baked for about 20 minutes, but my oven runs hot.  I  used 9 eggs and probably could have done with one more, or could have added a little milk to the eggs.  I will add this recipe to my list of things to serve for brunch when hosting!  The video is helpful too.

Big success and really easy.
I couldn't find the smoked chorizo at my lame neighborhood grocery, so per Chef John's suggestion I subbed a jalapeno pepperoni.  And used mexican grated cheese (cheaper than manchego).  But otherwise recipe as written and they were delicious - everyone at my Memorial Day brunch raved.  Will definitely make them again.

Disappointing. I followed the recipe using soy chorizo (shame on me, but that's what the snooty upscale grocery store with initials WF carried). I wasn't very competent on doing the ol' shake-a-shake-a (see video) and had egg flowing over the muffin cups. I result rated "their ok" by the family. Maybe real meat gets different results.

Fun little mini quiches! Very versatile recipe too. To make it vegetarian friendly,  I added a dollop of Sour Supreme on top to add in moisture and used Field Roast feisty Mexican chipolte  sausage. To save on expense, next time I'll just use whatever cheese I have on hand as the  Manchego is pricey but was tasty.

Mine stuck to the pan :( maybe because I used olive oil pan spray.  I will try again using baking/cooking spray.  Will also only add cheese to the top and add some green onions inside the mix.

I made this one. I did add to it which was diced onion and green onion to the chorizo. They were beautiful. One of the easiest things to make.

Love this ap.  We are in a wine group and were doing Spanish wines so made this to go with our wine.  Everyone loved them.  2 things I will do different next time, after beating the egg I will let the mixture sit until the foam settles so they won't be so messy and we really like chorizo so will use more and 1/2 the potato

Really yummy and easy to make! I chopped up pepperonis instead of chorizo. I recommend adding some onions, it really pumps of the flavor! These were great during the party, and served as a nice small bite for breakfast since they tasted like breakfast quiche.

Mini muffin tins must come in several sizes as I could see right away that I would have filling to spare. I only used six eggs and that worked perfectly for the muffin tins I have. Because my tins are so small, only a few tiny pieces of the chorizo and potato would fit. I baked for 10 minutes and that was enough. Would have been helpful to have some idea of the volume of muffin tin required. Flavor was good though.

Really yummy! I added diced onion and smoked gouda because I couldn't find manchego but it came out amazing.  I also used regular muffin mold instead of mini and I had to give it about 10 extra minutes of cooking time but they're fluffy and delicious!

My daughter loves these!  I make them on Sunday and then heat a few up each morning for her breakfast before she goes to school.  I only use 6 eggs, anymore and you end up pouring out the egg mixture because its too much.  Make sure to chop everything up very small if you use the mini muffin cups!

YUM! these were SO easy to make. I mixed in green chilies with the chorizo before I added the potato, and I used cheddar and pepper jack cheese instead. I will definitely be making these again. They would be great to make ahead of time for camping......(going to freeze one - to see if they hold up).

Oops! Pushed the wrong key! I may have misread the instructions. There was not enough of the chorizo-potato mixture for all 24 mini-muffin cups. Another time I will use a regular muffin pan adding more baking time. No question. I will make it again trying some of the suggested variations.

So easy to make and the possibilities are endless as you can use seafood or plain vegetarian, instead of using chorizo. I usually make these in advance and leave it in the fridge for the following day. 

Great to take with you on the go and you can make them keto/paleo friendly by substituting potato with other veggies, like celery or courgette, for instance. Thanks chef John for another fantastic recipe!

Simple and very easy to modify with cheese or meat of your choice.
