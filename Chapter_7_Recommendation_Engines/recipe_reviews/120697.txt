This is a basic recipe requiring little effort. Any cut would work well. I used panko (Japanese bread crumbs) instead of the crushed crackers. This seemed to have a better result that some of the other reviewers experienced. If you haven't tried this style breading, this is a good opportunity!

This is by far the BEST pork chop recipe I have ever come across. My husband asks for it on a weekly basis. It is fast, simple, and tastes incredible. The dijon mustard adds such a tangy, interesting flavor to the simple breading. My suggestions: use thin chops so they cook quickly, ensuring that the breading won't burn. Also, only flip the chops once in the pan, as the breading tends to stick to the pan. Only flip the meat once the bottom half is no longer pink, then cook on the other side until the inside is only slightly pink. That way they won't be dried out. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

This was a wonderful yummy recipe. I originally was looking for a basic mustard cream sauce but didn't find any that I wanted to try, then I found this that got a "phonominal"review from my husband who usually will eat nothing but italian. So this was huge!

Very tasty.  I used the recipe as written.  I didn't get the crumbs quite crushed enough.  It needs more oil, though, to keep the breading from sticking to the pan.

My mouth is still exploding with flavor. I did use Panko crumbs instead of crackers, added some garlic salt, but other than that followed the recipe and it was AWESOME!!! Thanks Shannon for the great idea of coating with Dijon Mustard. Loved It!!!

This was an easy, yummy recipe that even my picky kids liked. I seasoned the pork with seasoned salt and garlic too and used bread crumbs instead of crackers and mixed in parmesan cheese. (I save the ends of bread and toast them, then put them in a ziploc to use for bread crumbs when needed.) I gave it 4/5 stars because it wasn't extra-ordinary but good for a week-night meal.

Easy to prepare, and the Dijon mustard adds a nice flavour. I used bread crumbs and added a little salt for seasoning, but besides that, made the recipe as written. Use care in turning the chops over, or the coating will be knocked off.

Super easy!! And These are excellent, will definitely make them again. Very tender, moist, flavorful. Used breadcrumbs not crackers, needed a bit of salt in breading mix. Subbed sage with dry parsley b/c it was all I had on hand. Cooked in olive oil! Dijon gives it the perfect flavor and texture- I wouldn't use regular mustard. Thanks for an easy staple recipe that's delish!

I made this last night for the family.  I had to double the recipe to fit my family's needs and love to eat.   I used Kellogg's corn flake crumbs in stead of the saltine crackers.   This was so easy and absolutely delish!   My husband actually ate 4 chops!   Thank you for the recipe, it will definitely be in my bi-weekly rotation!   YUM!!!

This had a really nice flavor. I ground the crackers with spices in blender. Also added a little more of each of the spices. Will make this again for sure

My 3 girls LOVED this recipe.  We didn't have dried thyme but we did have fresh.  We didn't have Dijon mustard, just table mustard (Dijon would have been better).  I added white pepper because it smelled right for the recipe and added garlic and onion just because those two go very well with fresh herbs.  I also added 2 T of mayo because I was using table mustard, which tastes more sharp than Dijon.  Also, I used olive oil and lessened the amount.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because my version was a variant of the original.  I'm sure the original recipe would be a 5.  Also, knowing when to stop cooking the meat is a BIG deal here.  Don't overcook it.  Porkchops are like sawdust if you overcook them.

This recipe is good.  It isn't going to wow anybody, but it was nice.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and that worked great and I also used a pork tenderloin instead of pork chops.  I just put the mustard on it and then rolled it in the bread crumb mixture.  I'll make this again, but it isn't a recipe anybody in the family will be begging me to make.  It's easy and I have all the ingredients on hand so it's a winner for that reason.

I was disappointed.  Most of the reviewers loved this recipe, but I wasn't pleased.  I used panko crumbs because that's what I had.  The crust was crispy right after frying, then turned mushy.  Next time, I'll try the cracker crumbs and see what happens.

we love this recipe! it's so difficult to find something which is kind of "low-carb/fat/calorie" that he likes as well. i added lite mayo to the mustard to add a little moisture, but not many more calories. make sure to cook on MEDIUM to high heat as I didn't and almost burned and under-cooked the pork chops at the same time... lesson learned.

The flavor of these was great, only the breading wouldn't stick on the pork chops! I even added an egg in with the mustard and still, it fell right off after cooking. I think if I could play with this, I might get it to turn out differently. I did use a honey dijon mustard.

Wow, these were great.  I used seasoned Italian bread crumbs in place of the saltines, and added salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I'm not a big fan of fried foods, but I fried the chops in olive oil instead of vegetable oil and they didn't taste fried at all.  This tasted great and was super quick, so I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Dijon porks chops and chicken breasts are a stable in my house. I would recommend bread crumbs rather than crackers. And don't be afraid to add other flavors! I add garlic to about everything.

Fast, easy, and awesome! 3 picky kids begged me to make this again, and I will! I followed the recipe to the letter and found no fault with it at all as written. Using a blender, I pulverized the saltines and the spices together into a flour-like consistency. (by the way, one full sleeve of saltines yielded just over one cup of crumbs). The chops came out thickly coated and crispy brown on the outside, and moist on the inside. The chops had the appearance of fried chicken, which of course made my kids' eyes pop with pleasure! I used 1 inch thick boneless chops and cooked them 6 minutes per side on medium heat, turning only once. What a joy to cook and eat a meal as easy and tummy pleasing as this one! Thanks for sharing it, Shannon.

I cannot say anything negative about this....it was just great. I used the panko and it adhered well. I only browned these for about 4 minutes on each said then baked in the oven for about 25 minutes only because I had some work to do. My husband doesn't like Dijon and loved this. Really a nice change from plain ol' pork chops

i didn't really enjoy this. The pork tasted just like fried pork. There was no taste of the dijon at all. maybe if you marinated the pork in the mustard instead of just slapping it on and rolling it the saltines. Good luck with everyone else tryig to make this.

My daughter loved this! The dijon mustard added a unique flavor. I used plain bread crumbs and they had trouble sticking to the meat while frying. I browned the chops on the stovetop, then popped them in the oven to finish baking (cuts down on the amount of oil used). Delish!

This is a delicious recipe.  I like food with more flavor so I added both onion and garlic powders, as well as salt and used panko bread crumbs.  I used olive oil (for health reasons) and increased the amount so that the breading cooked well.  I served it with rice pilaf and a veggie.  Thanks for sharing!

The Dijon Pork Chops were very easy to make.  Loved the taste the Dijon gave to the chops.  If you like Dijon, I would recommend using more of the Dijon to the chops then recipe calls for.

I used only 2 pork chops to test this.  I used a Italian bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand.  Same with the mustard, I had a garlic mustard that I used.  I pan fried it for 4 min. and then baked in a toaster oven for about 20 min.  It was so good and easy, I will make this again this week with the other 2 chops I still have!

I gave this 5 stars because it gave me an alternative idea to make the best breaded pork chops I've ever had.  Instead of using saltines I used low salt Ritz, nuff said.

Great recipe!  My husband LOVED it... and that's a high compliment!  Instead of saltines I used plain bread crumbs bought from the grocery store, and I doubled the thyme and sage to give a bit more flavor.

Simple and easy. Also easy to adjust. I added more seasonings than asked and a few different ones. Also I used spicy mustard since thats what I had, and I crushed up corn flakes instead of breadcrumbs. Only problem I really had was the breading doesn't stick to the mustard very well, could be because I used the flakes but I crushed them pretty tiny. Overall I like it and prob will be making it again. First sucessful breaded pork chops I've made. Norm I cook them in soy and worchestershire sauce.

Excellent- although the breading didn't stay on well.  Used breadcrumbs instead of crackers.

Tasty, but we would try those Japanese bread crumbs for the coating next time because the coating falls off so easy!

I had high hopes for this but, I couldn't really taste the mustard so, this was just ok for me.  I was looking for more of a mustard flavor. It wasn't bad , I was just expecting more flavor. Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent!  But I opted to bake in oven for 1hr+ @ 350oF without any oil or frying prior to baking.  Used Ritz crackers instead of saltine  The mustard/sage combine was perfect. Will certainly be adding this recipe to the box.

It was absolutely delicious! The mustard flavor was subtle and it completely delights the tastebuds. (and I've not been any kind of mustard fan until recently) I made it according to the recipe; however, I think for even more flavor next time I will let the pork marinate in the mustard for a little while. I also had to take the pork off of the stove and put them into the oven to finish cooking, because between the oil and the medium high heat the crackers started to to burn. Even still, they were full of flavor and really juicy! I didn't have a problem with the crackers being soft or mushy.. starting the cooking out in the skillet and finishing on a rack in the oven really made that difference and they were crisp as well as juicy. I will definitely be making this again!

Loved these! Use a thinner chop to prevent crumbs from burning. I ended up baking them to finish the cooking without burning the bread crumbs. Mustard adds the perfect amount of tangyness.

This was great. Quick and simple. I did not have sage so I substituted rosemary.  Using Panko breadcrumbs is a good idea.

Very easy and delicious recipe.  I used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crackers, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

It was good but very frustrating that I couldnt get the bread crumbs to stay on very much at all. The favor was good but not great. Nothing better than my usual pork chops.

My husband and I really enjoyed these pork chops, what a simple way to make chops flavorful.  I used substituted rosemary for sage because that's what I had, but I can see how this could be used with any herbs that you like.

These were okay. I was looking for something new and found it, but doubt I'll keep it. I didn't make any changes, but baking them would be among the top changes I'd make. Also, might consider panko or ritz for additional texture or flavor.

Simple and delicious. Took 10 minutes to prep and 10 minutes to cook, and tasted great! One thing: be careful when turning the chops as the breading has a tendency to come off even on a nonstick pan!
