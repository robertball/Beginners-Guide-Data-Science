Kentucky lady approved! Here in Kentucky, we eat this often. It is great for holiday leftovers or you could get some turkey sliced thick from the deli. Either way, it is delicious. Also, if you have ham, sometimes we throw them both in. This recipe was on target, but I must say I have never had it with mushrooms, so I did not include them when I made this recipe. The cheese sauce was good, but I will add that you don't necessarily have to use parmesan cheese. Here in Kentucky, we use whatever we have on hand. Suprisingly, Velveeta works great in this recipe. However, if you use Velveeta, don't tell anyone because it cuts down on the classiness of the dish. lol

Yum!  I haven't had this in years and was so happy to find it here.  I did revise a little to make it how I was familiar with it.  Instead of individual sandwiches I made it into a casserole by layering the bread, turkey, sauce, bacon, tomato, more sauce and finally some parmesean cheese.  The bread was a little soggy so next time I will toast it more before and I didn't add mushrooms, I can't stand them.  Oh yeah, I added about 1/2 c. of cheddar to the sauce as well.  Thanks again for the recipe!

As a Kentuckian, I've eaten many a Hot Brown.  This is my first attempt to make one at home, and we really enjoyed it.  Quick and easy.  I did cut back on the bread, broke the toast in pieces, used diced tomatoes, crumbled the bacon, and made it casserole style.  My husband said he'd never cared much for Hot Browns, but really like this version.  We'll definitely use this one again.

This was my favorite lunch @ The Brown Hotel in Louisville when I lived there in the '60's.  I remember it with a Chedder Sauce, so that is the way I made it.  I also remember the tomato was brioled with olive oil, basil and parmesan cheese and served on the side at the Hotel...this was  my favorite 'after turkey day' meal for years.  My Grandaughter called and asked me what the left over turkey sandwich was with the cheese and bacon on top...She wanted to make it.  This is a great dish...impressive, too,from leftovers!

We loved this dish!!  I used cheddar cheese rather than parmesan for the sauce, and I omitted the egg, and then topped each sandwich with shredded mozzarella before placing under the broiler and they were GREAT!!  My husband absolutely LOVED them and he is incredibly picky about his food.  This will be made again and again!!

the original recipe calls for a little cream to be added and doesn't have mushrooms.

Well, I've never made or even had a Kentucky Hot Brown before, but because it looked intriguing, I've had this in my recipe box for quite awhile and just kept forgetting about it. Last night I watched Bobby Flay's "Throw Down" show and was immediately reminded. As a matter of fact "Downalong", the Brown Hotel you referred to in your review was Bobby's challenge. Although I took one tip from Bobby which was to do the bread French toast style and the hotel boys cheddar sauce, I followed your recipe to a "T". I knew my girls would love this dish, but I wasn't quite as sure about hubby as he's not so into the whole cheese sauce thing. Kristie, I'm so thrilled to tell you that hubs absolutely LOVED your recipe!! I think it's so cool serving a dish that one of our States and/or Countries around the world are so famous for. Thanks Kristie for allowing the rest of us a taste of the Derby!!

The first time I made this, it became an instant family classic!  Use a sturdy bread like sour dough, otherwise the sauce could make the bread soggy.

As a native of the Derby city, I believe this is a very a good Hot Brown recipe.  I recently made this and it was fantastic.  Make sure to use a nice thick cut bread so that it doesn't become overly soggy.  

I also used this sauce plus some frozen chopped onions and a handful of crumbled bacon to make creamed peas when I needed last minute side dish one day.  It was very quick and delicious.

Awesome!  I did the casserole version because we were serving a larger crowd for a Derby party.  Tore the toast into small pieces, layered it with tomatoes turkey and crumbled turkey bacon (skipped the mushrooms b/c I'm allergic) and then the cheese sauce.  Won wave reviews at the party and is definitely a repeat menu item on Derby Day!  

I should add that we lived in KY for four years and always thought that Hot Browns were awful.  This recipe totally changed our minds.

I married a man from Louisville and I've been making hot browns for 25 years. I too have never heard of mushrooms on one, but to each his own. We have decided over the years that we enjoy a mixture of swiss and cheddar cheese for the cheese sauce. About two cups combined. The other ingredient that we add is a Tbs. of cooking sherry right before finishing the cheese sauce. It gives a great little burst of flavor. Before broiling each hot brown I sprinkle paprika over them for a splash of color.

I found Kristie's recipe a few years ago at Derby time and now it's an annual tradition at our house!  Be sure to saute the fresh mushrooms until lightly browned for more flavor.  We love it!

here in pittsburgh the hot brown is a close kin to our devonshire sandwich. it has almost the same ingredients (except mushrooms) & process however we make a cheddar cheese sauce seasoned with a healthy shake of ground cayenne pepper. i used thick cut sourdough bread for our hot browns although any hearty loaf will do. this type of meal is delicious & nurtures the soul. thanks kristie!

After watching the PBS program, "Sandwiches You Will Like," I got a hankering to try a Kentucky Hot Brown. My recipe search brought me to the Allrecipes.com site where I was delighted to find Kristie's version. I invited friends over and served these sandwiches for dinner. They were great! So rich and delicious. Luckily tomatoes are in season, so the sandwiches got an extra boost from those perfectly ripe babies. My sauce was a little stiffer than I would have liked. When I make these again (and I will be making them again!) I will not put the whole 6 tablespoons of flour into the butter right off the bat. Maybe I'll try it with 4 Tablespoons next time. Also, I heated my milk before adding it to the roux.

My dear friend was born and raised in Kentucky. She has never gotten used to what she deems "odd tasting northern food."  Maybe this is that thinking in reverse. To me this was so much work for a sandwich and the combination of the hot sauce, turkey, tomatoes and bacon just did not work for me. Thanks anyway.

Yum!  I've never eaten anything like this but my husband and I both enjoyed this one.  I used dense homemade bread for the toast and it was not in the least soggy.  I halved the recipe to serve just my husband and I and it turned out great.

We LOVED this, kids and all. I did do as suggested and threw it all in a 11x14 dish and made it casserole style. It sure made things easier. Next time I make it I will just try making the gravy with the bacon drippings instead of butter, thats the kind of gravy I grew up on. Husband said keep this recipe out and make it twice a month, indefinately!

Omit the mushrooms. Pep Farm white makes         better toast for this. Cheddar cheese sauce with a kick of Worcestershire sauce Rotisserie chicken breast can be used in lieu of turkey. If you use tomato slices put them on top of the turkey not on the toast.

This is a very good recipe but for a true Ky Hot Brown do not use mushrooms, use cream instead of milk, no egg, and always toast the bread under a broiler for 1-2 min per side. Country Ham can be added with the turkey giving even a greater "Bluegrass" fare. We love the Hot Browns in Louisville.

I was terribly disappointed in this recipe. It didn't taste at all, which was delicious, like I had in a restaurant. This was bland and it didn't have anywhere near enough sauce to "smother that baby" as the person who submitted this recipe suggested. I will try another recipe from another source that uses cheddar (at least 1 cup) for the sauce and parmesan.

after reading the reviews I had to try this version and it was ok.  Call me old fashioned but I like it much better making a regular with the mornay sauce using Romano cheese.

I make this every year for the Kentucky Derby and everyone loves it!  I make a turkey tenderloin on the grill and use that as the turkey meat.  Also, I find the sauce a little bland, so I add a handfull of cheddar cheese, some chicken bouillion and garlic salt to kick it up, and it turns out delicious.

I am from Kentucky and I love Hot Brown, but I don't see any reviews where they added ham to the recipe.  I have never had it without ham in addition to the turkey, and have never had it with mushrooms.  I guess it all depends on where you eat.  It is always Yummy!

I wanted to try this cause it looks good and its something different. I thought it  was OK.. It tasted pretty bland to me... actually it tasted a little floury. I think it needs more flavor. I didn't add the bacon cause i didnt have any, maybe that would have made it better. Next time i'll try a different recipe.

minus the mushrooms due to personel preference, and using a sturdy thick bread that has been toasted this recipe is very good. serve it with the strawberry spinach salad 1 from this sight, read reviews, the kentucky derby pie known as run for the roses pie 3 on this site, you will have a wonderful kentucky derby dinner. instead of individual plates, i make them in 9x13 glass casserole dish. don't forget the mint juleps. all are easy, but yet you will have an elegent dinner to impress your dinner guests.

I've eaten Hot Brown's in many a Kentucky restaurant and in many ways. This one is pretty darn good... not the absolute best, but nowhere near the worst. My favorite is when it's made as a 'sandwich'. However, a KHB (Kentucky Hot Brown) really isn't a sandwich. To me, it's more of an entree. It just tastes better when it is assembled right before you're ready to eat it and popped under the broiled to brown the cheese a bit.    However, every Kentucky State Park Lodge restaurant I've been in serves it on their buffets casserole style and it is very tasty... although not real appealing to the eye.  Also, most places I've eaten it, served it with a peach half. Although it's not necessary... it just adds a bit of whimsy and lightness to a pretty rich meal.  We love our Hot Browns...

Hot Browns are really good. My wife loves them. I had made them before at the restaurant I worked at but couldn’t remember how to make the gravy. This recipe is great and it takes no time at all! I am still in search of a good ham...Thanks for the recipe!

I love kentucky hot browns, moved to kentucky 9yrs ago,was introduced to this delicious sandwich at one of the wonderful state park dining lodges, thick slices of ham along with the turkey we're in mine, also cheddar cheese on top put under the broiler for a minute added to the yummy taste.

Everyone but my picky 3 year old ate this, but I changed it a little, I used more milk, nuked the mushrooms and to cut down on time I used the pre cooked bacon.  My hubby loves spicy stuff so I put his on jalepeno bread.

Delicious sandwich! The adults liked the tomato and mushroom combination, and the kids loved the sandwich without. My picky 6 year old son raved about it and asked me to put it in our family recipe box (reserved only for the best recipes!) Thank you.

This recipe is delicious. I live in Louisville and the Kentucky Hot Browns I've had have had Mornay sauce smothering the top. The mornay sauce gives it a rich flavor. I love this spin on the hot brown too! Thank you:)

This dish is sooo yummy!  It takes some time with all the different steps, but it is well worth it.  I make this every year on Kentucky Derby Day.  Certainly not for the calorie cautious, but a nice dish to splurge on.

This was awesome.  We've been to the Brown during derby week and had these. So when I found this recipe, I was excited.  What a great way to use leftover turkey.  I had extra sauce left and put that over eggs the following morning!

Not long ago we watched one of those travel/food shows on t.v. and the Brown Hotel's Hot Brown was featured.  At the time we thought it looked interesting.  Then just the other day I was browsing AR for recipes that would use up some of our leftover Thanksgiving turkey when I stumbled across this recipe.  Made this today and we all loved it!  Definitely a do-over!  I followed recipe exactly for this first attempt; decided next time (and there will be many next times) that we'd like even more mushrooms (although I know they weren't part of the Brown Hotel's version, they are yummy).  I also like the idea of trying more/other cheeses (romano, cheddar).  Great recipe and very appreciative you shared it here!

Very good! My sauce turned out very runny! Is this normal? I added some more flour and some cream cheese to thicken it up. They turned out YUMMY!

I was born and raised in KY and have always been a fan of the hot brown!  This recipes was very good! The only thing I changed was I used 1 1/2 C shredded cheddar and 1/2C shredded parmesan(I have always had them with a cheddar sauce)! I also omitted the mushrooms because we don't use them back home on hot browns!  Over all I thought it was very close to the original! Thanks!

I made a turkey on the grill last sunday and was wondering what to make with the leftovers. Wow, I am glad I came across this. I didn't have any tomatoes on hand, so I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles. Gave it some zip. Wifey is not too fond of tomatoes, but she enjoyed this dish. In my recipe box for good!

Really good!  Made for a KY Derby party and everyone loved it.  Do make sure you toast the bread well, or it will get soggy.  Three stars because it was very rich.

Wow. If I could give this 20 stars I would!  I had tons of leftover lunch meat from our Halloween party.  I used up all of the turkey and substituted the bacon this recipe calls for with a small piece of honey ham.  AWESOME!  Everyone loved it and fought for the leftovers!  thanks so much for the recipe!!

This recipe was good but is way way more than 4 servings!  In the future I will cut it in half for my family of four.  It is a great way to use up leftover turkey though.  I was too lazy to thaw the bacon for frying so I substituted it with sliced ham which was very good.

I had fun with this.  After I made this for my family, (and we all liked it) I got curious and looked up the history of the sandwich...Very interesting!! I omitted the mushrooms to make the kids happy.  This was really different and not really at all what I was expecting, but good nonetheless.  I would make sure your toast is on the over-toasted end of the spectrum because there is a lot to soften it up.  Mine came out perfectly and I cooked the toast much drier than I would normally prefer.  A very good comfort food on a rainy fall day.

We had some leftover smoked chicken and I had been wanting to make this.  We found it bland the first day but the flavors seemed to meld by lunch the next day. Unfortunately by then the bread was very soggy. Hubby tried it with a sprinkling of cayenne and liked the bit of a kick.

Really tasty -- if you like rich food smothered in cheesy gravy!  Good with a side salad and not much else.  Will probably try the bread cubed and layered in a casserole next time.

This dish is VERY similiar to one you can find served at a wonderful restaurant in the Atlanta area called Chick-A-Fil.  Only their's uses chicken breast instead of turkey.  DELICIOUS!!!  I now live in the Southern California area, so I was very pleased to find this recipe.  I never even thought of using turkey!

My husband liked this more than I did hence the four stars. Had never made a hot brown before and our only other experience with them was bad school cafeteria food. I cannot see making this again. I thought the cheese sauce was too gravy like.

I left mushrooms out. Also I made the cheese sauce with 1/2 c Locatelli Romano cheese and added a bit of cheddar cheese. I also put in  a splash of  worstershire sauce . I pour the cheese sauce over the bread and turkey layers and then top with bacon and lots of tomato and put it under the broiler till bubbly. Pepper to taste.

I converted this recipe into a casserole/baked dish like several others. The cheese sauce in this dish is phenomenal. Would be great in macaroni and cheese.

Louisville is one of my favorite cities in America, but it's also a 6+ hour drive from my home, so this recipe will do in a pinch when I need a Hot Brown fix. The only change I made was adding a splash of white wine and a pinch of dried thyme to the mushrooms, because I'm not a huge mushroom fan and I thought I could dress them up a little. Pretty good - not the best Hot Brown I've ever had, but better than no Hot Browns at all!

I guess we just don't like bland food. Even with adding cayenne & some worcestershire sbutauce to the cheese, it was too flavorless. I guess it was ok, but we won't be making it again. Now I have a ton of bland cheese sauce we have to find something to do with. haha

This is very rich, but quite good. Per other users suggestions I served it as a casserole- as with all food, it's only as good as the ingredients so make sure you have bread and turkey that you really like (dietz and watson's honey maple is fabulous)

I made a half recipe of this for two of us, and I think that next time, I'll save half for leftovers. It was really good, but really heavy and filling. I cut back on the turkey, and I think it still had plenty. One piece would be more than enough for me, along with a salad.
