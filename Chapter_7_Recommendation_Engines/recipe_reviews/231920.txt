This was good, not amazing, but good everyday easy side dish.  I didn't have crushed rosemary and didn't bother to crush what I had.  I wish I did because each rosemary leaf was a little too intense.

It's good.  It's easy.  But that's it... no fireworks,  nothing terribly special, but it's good.

This was really good! I didn't have any rosemary handy, so I decided to change it up some. I used thyme and a little chicken bouillon. I also mixed in some flax and chia seeds for the added health benefit. This changed the texture some, making it almost like a thick risotto.
