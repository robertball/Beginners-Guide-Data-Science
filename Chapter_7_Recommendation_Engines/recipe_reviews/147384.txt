I made this recipe last night using Marlin and it was fantastic! I made a couple changes: When marinading, I left the rosemary sprig whole so it infused into the oil. I was afraid it would taste too strongly of rosemary if it was chopped in both the relish and on the fish. I did not have cherry tomatoes, so I diced regular tomatoes. I also grilled it on a wood plank for about 10 minutes, then directly on the grill for a few minutes on each side. The relish was a great compliment to the fish! Thanks for the great recipe- I can't wait to make it again!

This four star rating is more for the relish, which was particularly good. The fish, however, not so good. Hubs, the grill master, believes it was the marinading that took away from how good this COULD have been. Once put on the grill, the olive oil just flowed out of the meat, preventing it from browning nicely. He said the filets should be dry, then rubbed lightly with olive oil just before grilling on a hot grill, which would then also require less than the directed time - and they also need a good squeeze of lemon. The relish, on the other hand, was just delicious. Great fresh flavor and colors, but I think it could be put to better use with something other than this fish. I served this with a seasoned couscous, which we've finally concluded we don't like. I should have made the rice pilaf I had originally planned on.

This was great. Although I did not have fresh rosemary, (I used dried) it still was great. The corn and tomato relish could and WILL be used with other dishes and also just as a side dish. One of the great things about living here in South Dakota at this time of year is the most wonderful tasting sweet corn fresh off the farm. Using sweet corn really gave this relish a nice taste. I did not alter the recipe and I don't feel like I would need to add or take anything out...it's great! 9/17/08 I made the relish as a side dish tonight and it was great....be sure to use sweet corn and not field or frozen corn (or add a touch of sugar to the mix)!

This is good. I made this with mahi mahi because marlin is harder to find where I live. I liked the rosemary, tomato and corn combination. I went quite a bit lighter on the salt in the salsa than called for and added lemon to both the fish marinade and the salsa - I think this misses a little something without it. Thanks for the recipe!

The marlin was not very good but the roasted corn and tomatoes were amazing.  Marlin is not a very good fish to eat. Mostly a game fish but I thought I would try it when the local fish market had some.  It was tough.  I think this recipe would be amazing on mahi mahi or swordfish!!  Can not wait to try again on a better fish!

This recipe turned out fantastic!  I was a little scared of the rosemary so I put in a little less than the recipe suggested.  Bad move - next time I will put in a little more.

In addition to following the recipe, my husband threw on some hickory wood chips to the grill before putting the fish on. Oh my, the marlin was so smoky and fragrant, it was delicious! The corn/tomato relish complimented the fish perfectly. It's definitely now my favorite way of preparing marlin! YUM!  (we also had the most amazingly sweet cherry tomatoes, fresh from our neighbor's tomato patch..... thanks, Paul!)

I agree with the other reviewers who say that the corn and tomato relish is amazing! I am sure I will make this recipe often.

I followed this recipe exactly, and the corn/tomato mixture turned out EXCELLENT. I ended up mixing it into my rice pilaf side dish.....YUM....I'm making it again tonight. I wasn't thrilled with the marlin, but it was my first time eating Blue Marlin so maybe I'm just not a big fan. I look forward to trying this recipe with Halibut. The corn tomato dish is really excellent, definitely try it- you will be pleasantly surprised!

You really have to LOVE rosemary to appreciate this recipe. I used half a sprig and didn't chop it too fine because another review suggested the rosemary might be overwhelming and it was still too strong.

This was very tasty.  I didn't have fresh basil or corn so I used dried basil and canned nibblets.  Also chopped round tomatoes.  I reduced the salt from 2 tsp. to 1/2tsp.  Worked well.

I used this recipe today for swordfish steaks. It was very tasty, and we will definitely make it again! It only makes 4 stars for 2 reasons. The salsa needed a little something, and I think the juice of half a lemon would have been the perfect finishing touch. The second reason is that the portion of salsa to fish was a little low for my family's taste. We wanted more salsa! Doubling the salsa recipe for 2 lbs of fish and adding lemon would make this a 5 star. The only changes I made on the first go 'round were to use 3 half-lb steaks instead of 2 lbs and less olive oil for the fish as some reviewers suggested. I used 2 large sprigs of rosemary and thought it was the perfect amount of flavor for 1.5 lbs. I'll add a little extra rosemary if I use 2 full lbs next time.

I made this recipe but didn't marinate the marlin. I just put salt and pepper and rosemary olive oil and cooked it. After that I poured the relish over. The relish was so delicious. I slightly charred my relish and it tasted great! I made this twice already and will continue to make it for other..you have to try this and enjoy :)

The Salsa was amazing! My only advice would be to add lime juice to your marlin while marinating and then tenderize the meat a little before grilling. I will definitely be making this again though.

The fish was a tad overcooked, but tasted very meat-like; I did not have fresh rosemary, so used dried and did not really notice the flavour of rosemary.  The relish took a lot longer than the recipe indicated.
