Thanks, Aunt Eileen!  What an incredible vegetarian recipe!  Hollow the eggplant halves to leave a very thin layer (1/4 inch) of flesh, so that when it bakes, the remaining flesh is cooked tender and pulls easily away from the skin... I deglazed the pan with some of the vinegar from the capers jar to get the great caramelization from the bottom and added it to the bowl of stuffing... I also substituted Pecorino Romano cheese for the Gruyere (because that's what I had)... I really was surprised at how well it turned out... I will definitely invite guests the next time I make this!

God bless you, Aunt Eileen.  Great recipe and this is how I tweaked it :  mixed parmagian instead of gruyere, topped with bottled sun dried tomato and black olive Safeway spaghetti sauce and some mozzarella.  To those that say this is labor intensive: don't scoop eggplant out, take a small sharp good knife and slice halved eggplant in square grid to within an 1/8 th inch of shell(If you break through shell it doesn't matter, it will still hold stuffing)carve out chunks by running knife along sides of shell and as close to center as you can get, pull or cut out chunks then put chunks in the food processor and pulse. You might also use food processor to chop onions and throw in the garlic cloves with them while you're at it.  Bake shells at 425 for 10 minutes while you're cooking chopped chunks, onions, etc.. Take shells out of oven and turn down oven to 350 and by the time it cools to that temperature, the shells should be stuffed and you should be ready to bake those perfectly stuffed  eggplants.

Great recipe! My meat-loving boyfriend even liked it. I put the eggplant, onion and garlic in the food processor and I put the filling in the refrigerator for a couple hours to allow the flavors to develop. Thanks! Will make again!

This was very easy and extremely tasty! I used Asiago cheese instead - I also baked on a cooking stone.  I added more garlic/onion and hot pepper.  Excellent, will make again!

I don't think it's eggplant season yet, so I used cucumber instead! I chilled the stuffing for a couple hours as someone else suggested, I used kalamata olives, and omitted the lemon juice and capers -- i couldn't get the jar open! It turned out great and very good-looking. My parents (for whom I made this) loved it and even suggested I may be a better cook than my older brother! Best compliment ever!

This is so good it has become one of my regular dinners!  One large eggplant cut in half makes a great filling meal in itself for two people.

It was a little bland. I squeezed lemon on top and that made it taste quite a bit better. I think it would taste better if you baked it with some marinara sauce on top. Will try this tomorrow night with the leftovers.

This is a go-to favorite in my meat-loving house, but I find it MUCH easier and tastier to eat topped with italian style canned diced tomatoes instead of sliced fresh ones. (Those hot tomato slices on top can be awkward and a lot of tomato in one bite). To those that find it bland, its much more flavorful with italian-flavored bread crumbs. It's cheaper and just as good without the olives and capers, and substituting grated mozzarella or Parmesan for the Gruy√®re.

Great!  Our company liked it too.  Followed the recipe except used dried parsley instead of fresh, monterey jack cheese instead of gruyere, and skipped the capers to save money.  We'll make it again.  I think it helps to dice (pulse a few times) the eggplant, onion and garlic in the food processor, and cook all together instead of cooking eggplant first for 1 minute, that's not necessary.

I like it very much. ALready made it twice and guess will make it soon again. It's very easy to make yet so tasty. A bit hot, so you can add less pepper. It's really delicious!

I served this at a dinner party and it got rave reviews.  Everone loved it except for 2 children who refused to even try it.  It took me much longer than 20 minutes for prep time, but it was well worth it.

This is one of those hard to find vegetarian main dishes that meat eaters will love!  (As long as they love cheese).  Due to time, its not something that can go on my weekly schedule but it is worth the effort if you have the time.

Left out the capers (since I don't often have those) and this recipe is still a hit.  I've made it 5+ times and love every bit of it.  To make it even healtier I use some breadcrumbs and some ground flaxseed, it gives it a nice nutty flavor!

I'm not sure what happened with this one...I made the recipe as written but the eggplant was really hard and we had to just scoop the filling out and eat it by itself.  I'm a beginner cook so not sure if the eggplant just wasn't ripe enough?  We ended up throwing this out though.

My hubby who doesn't like eggplant at all ate this. I accidentally added too many bread crumbs (i cut the recipe in half) so i threw in an egg and some zucchini and extra black olives! I also used italian flavored bread crumbs cuz it was all i had on hand. Which made it a  little overpowering with all the other flavors, but i still thought it was good, will be making this again! Thank you!

Very good.  Next time I might replace the breadcrumbs with cous cous and see what happens.  If you don't spray the tops with olive oil before baking, the eggplant husk becomes dry.  My husband liked this very much and he usually is not a fan of vegetarian dishes.

This was super yummy! I only gave it a four because I modified it a bit to make it more healthy. The following are what I changed: I used three medium egglplant and scooped them out as close to the skin as possible. I also used two onions, 4 big cloves garlic, around 6 tbs black olives, 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1 tbs basil, 1 1/2 tbs oregano, 1 tbs rosemary, 2 tsp italian seasoning, and 1/2 cup white wine. I left out the capers and did not sprinkle the 4 tbs olive oil on top. Now for  the bread crumbs. I substituted with 1/2 c rye flour, 1/2 c wheat germ, 3/4 c barley flakes. My family didn't even know and SO much healthier! I also think I may have doubled the cheese. At the end I sprinkled parmesan on the top for a great finish. To cook, I baked shells for ten minutes at 190 C, then stuffed along with sliced tomato to bake for 15 minutes, finally topped with cheese and popped it back in for the last 5 minutes or so.  I most definitely recommend this recipe:D

I am a meat eater, but having this for dinner definitely satisfied me so much that I didn't miss meat at all. It's very filling and very good. I do think some marinara sauce to top it off might be good and other cheeses would work too like other reviewers suggested. I made it with no changes. The only thing I would say is that it certainly took me much longer than 20 min. in prep time. Try over an hr for me. I did have to make the fresh breadcrumbs, so maybe tht added time, but it just was more work than 20 min for me.... maybe I chop slowly or something. :) But it is a very good recipe.

This came out delicious. We omitted the garlic for preference. The ingredients can be costly but It would be easy enough to substitute cheddar cheese and omit the capers. We also used greek olives instead of black. This recipe made 2 large eggplant. I bet the small ones would be great too for individual servings.

This recipe was okay. As someone else mentioned, it was pretty -- but just not as tasty. Not that it wasn't tasty at all, just not really all that good. I've got lots of leftovers that no one wants to eat.

This was an excellent recipe.  I put in a little more garlic than it called for, and we used sharp cheddar cheese instead of gruyere.  It was really delicious!  We had some ideas of using the filler for appetizers by stuffing mushroom caps with it or wrapping it in filo dough.

Great dish. Substituted Parmesan cheese. But followed the recipe other than that. Everyone liked it. Was not a favorite for the kids. Will definitely make again!

I added thinly sliced mushrooms and it was wonderful! I made a triple batch and froze them after rolling them into balls.
Can put them on top of spagetti, even make meatball subs. Thank you for a great way to use my abundant eggplant! Will be making again!

I really enjoyed all of the flavors in this recipe.  They all complement each other to make a very delicious dish. I used Japanese eggplant I got at the farmer's market and they came out wonderful. Thank for a great recipe to use up my bounty of eggplant.

This dish is excellent. And a lot easier to make than it seemed while I was reading it. This is going to be a regular dish for us.

I love eggplant, and this recipe has become a regular for us. I don't stuff the shells, but rather, use the whole eggplant. I cook the whole thing is an iron skillet, then pop the skillet into the oven to melt the cheese.  I did substitute sharp cheddar chese for the cheese called for, and put in lots of black olives.  I am so glad I tried this recipe.  Khazirahn

The only thing I found is that it takes longer than 30 minutes to bake. I perused other recipes and the majority of them preheat the oven to 400 degrees. It's still baking and I'm sure it's delicious! :) PS - I have an Aunt Eileen but I don't think you're her. ;) Thanks

Loved this! It looked like something you might order at a fancy restaurant (I used one long skinny eggplant cut in half lenghtwise). I also used purple onions in the recipe and served baby greens in a side salad. There was so much color on the plate I almost didn't want to eat it! Even my steak-loving roommate loved it. Thanks for this easy and beautiful recipe, Aunt Eileen!

I really enjoyed this recipe..I didn't have any black olives, and i used swiss cheese (8oz) instead, and it still came out GREAT.  I can't wait to try it with the gruyere chese, and black olives in it.

Great recipe!!  I also added two cans of Devil's Ham to the mixture to give it a meaty flavor.  DELICIOUS!!!
