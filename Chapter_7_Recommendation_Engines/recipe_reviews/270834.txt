I don't own a waffle iron but the mix works well for pancakes also. Great idea if you want a savory breakfast instead of a sweet. You have to remember that spinach adds moisture so adjust liquid to compensate.

Made both waffles and pancakes. Waffles turned out better.My wife suggested a touch of cinnamon to the batter. Definitely a keeper.

I made these exactly as written.  They were very good and filling.  I liked that they give you the option of sweet or savory.  I put peanut butter and syrup on them.  The next time I'll go savory.  I used my Vitamix and the batter came out perfectly.  This one is a keeper.
