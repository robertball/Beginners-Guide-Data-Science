This was really good. I do however think the pasta needs reduced by half. The flavor was good but there wasn't enough sauce to cover all of the pasta making it a little dry. I'll definitely make this again but will reduce the pasta next time.

This was very good except it was way too much pasta.  I think one pound would be correct.  Also, it was a bit thick and needed some pasta water to thin it down at the end.  Otherwise, very good and I will make it again.  I might also add some small sauteed veggies such as carrots, or artichokes at the end to bulk it up.  Just an idea.
