I did not have oat flour, what I did was use equal amounts oats that I "ground" down in my blender to a fine consistancy (think whole wheat flour). Other than that, I kept to the recipe exact. This waffle turned out soft and fluffy with a crisp exterior--a wonderful waffle! NOTE: Keep in mind when you use whole wheat flour or oats in any form that after you mix the batter up, you will have to let the batter sit for 5-10 minutes to get the whole wheat flour/oats soak up some of the liquid. This way, the batter won't be thin and run all over the outside of your waffle iron.

I made these this morning because my 5 year old daughter asked if we could have waffles for breakfast. I used 1 cup white whole wheat flour & 1/2 cup oat flour (just because I didn't feel like making more oat flour & that's what I had on hand). Absolutely delicious! Hopefully, they freeze well bc I plan on freezing a few for a quick breakfast on school mornings...I can just pop them in the toaster oven! Thanks for sharing!

Makes good crispy waffles.  A little on the sweet side for our taste, so I will play around with the sugar.  Whipping the egg whites really produces a nice batter consistency.

This recipe was amazing! If you like sweet things, these will definitely please you! I added some cinnamon and flax seeds to the batter as well (neither addition was noticeable in terms of taste, but it's nice to have the extra flax nutrients and the blood sugar balance effect from the cinnamon added in!). The egg white makes them so fluffy and slightly crisp- it's like a funnel cake without being fried. I could easily put vanilla ice cream on one and eat it for dessert :P. I would definitely make these again!

I used coconut oil instead of canola oil. I also used whole raw oats instead of oat flour, added a tsp. of cinnamon and chopped pecans. I can't purchase whole wheat flour where I live, so I just used white flour. These were still awesome!

this is my go to waffle recipe! the tiny but if extra time to best the egg whites is absolutely worth the crisp lighter tasting waffle that still has that earthy whole wheat flavor. I, like many others, just put oats in a food processor for oat flour.

These were delicious! I substituted almond milk for the milk and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a grated, peeled apple. Very tasty! A definite favorite that will be enjoyed again!

This recipe makes a healthy tasting waffle with great texture.  My family wasn’t as impressed with them because they were a little heavier than the traditional waffle, but I thought they were nice for a change.   Oat flour is easily made by grinding old fashion oats in the blender.

Absolutely delicious! They are worth the extra work of whipping the egg whites. I didn't have oat flour, but I had rolled oats. I used a coffee grinder to make my own oat flour. These freeze well. Just put them in a Ziploc bag and toast them when ready to eat.

This recipe is good. I used almond milk and added 2 tbsp of cocoa powder ( I wanted chocolate :)). It wasn't too sweet, I guess that depends on your taste. Also, I just put some oatmeal into the coffee grinder and made some oat flour.

Have made these probably a dozen times now. The sugar can definitely be cut down without sacrifice. I also use all whole wheat flour and have stopped whipping the egg whites separately. It does add something to do the whipping but I don’t mind a denser waffle. Using almond milk instead of dairy milk enhances the fluffiness as well; we make them both ways depending on what I have on hand. I love just throwing all the ingredients in a blender to make for a quick and easy morning.

Was skeptical about the batter being thin even after leaving it sit but it worked!  First time batter did not leak out of the sides or the lid raise up. Was a little sweet but I also used stevia. That’s an easy fix. Outside was not crispy but I forgot how to use my waffle maker. Overall was a good base recipe. Will use it again and play around a little with ingredients.

I ground up 1 cup of oats since I didn't have oat flour, added 1/4 cup almond flour and used honey in place of sugar, since we had no sugar in the house. Waffles were good but a bit breadier than I would have liked, as I like my waffles crisp throughout.

An excellent recipe with a great technique. Our family takes out the sugar and it's still great. Considering we tend to add jam or syrup to our waffles, the sugar is superfluous to us with regards to this recipe.

I did make some changes because I didn't have whole wheat pastry or oat flour on hand. I used 1 Cup all purpose and 1/2 each of whole wheat flour and dry quick oats. Added a pinch of cinnamon 
The waffles had very good texture and tasted great!

This very lean waffle had the texture of pillow stuffing and a strong flavor of baking powder.  I followed the directions adapting for wheat and milk sensitivity, using soy milk and spelt flour.  Following others recommendations I used only 1 T sugar.  I might try again using 4 T butter instead of 2 T oil, a lower percentage of oat flour and less baking powder.

I use white whole wheat flour,  fresh ground oat flour and forgo the white flour altogether. My family loves this recipe. We pair it w fresh whipped cream and berries. Def 5 stars. They freeze well too.

Comes together quickly, even with the whipped egg whites, and cooks up lovely, light waffles. Made with 1 cup of  oatmeal run through the food processor and 1 cup of regular flour (since I didn't have whole wheat).  Topped with the Sauteed Apples by 356 here on Allrecipes and didn't even need syrup.

I liked them okay, but they were a little soggy, even with waffle maker on a high setting and turning a dark brown.  I whipped the egg whites as recommended, and as others have done, I put oats in food processor as I had no oat flour.  I found that it helped the crispiness to toast for a short time in pop up toaster after making them in waffle maker.  My picky 12yo was not a fan and she would have rated them 3 stars.  I thought that were pretty decent for a whole grain recipe.

a very easy recipe that I did without messing up! The only 2 issues I had were: 1. The amount of sugar was too sweet even though I lessened it to 5tsps! 2. I tried to substitute the canola oil for coconut oil. the coconut oil solidified in the mixture (maybe bc it wasn't stirred and incorporated fast enough...?)
otherwise, a very healthy option for breakfast!

Delicious! I ground oats to make flour, otherwise kept it all the same. My only complaint is that they weren't very crispy on the outside. Otherwise they were perfect, hubby really enjoyed them too.

Never buying prepackaged waffle/pancake mix again. This recipe is scrumptious. I don't bother to separate the eggs as they are still quite tasty without trying to figure out what to do with egg yolks. Even better when you add cinnamon and nutmeg.

Excellent! I made the oat flour by putting steel cut oats in the blender. I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of one. My family loved these waffles.

Great waffles.  They're a bit heavier than the nutrition-less kind out of the box, but for my family that was a good thing.  There's a sweetness to them but not too sweet.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I didnt have oat flour.  So like others, i put some whole oats in my food processor and whirled away.
