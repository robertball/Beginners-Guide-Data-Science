Great Recipe, add more red curry paste for more flavour and add sesame oil instead of grapeseed, less though. Squeeze in real lime and add thai basil if you can find it and/or kaffir lime leaves (these keep well in the freezer). Another name for this is Tom Ka Gai soup.Very yummy! I like to use mushrooms, lemongrass and onions instead of broccoli making it more of a Tom Ka Gain soup.  Also for gluten free makes sure you check the chicken stock you use as most commercial stocks are NOT gluten free!

I was craving some Thai soup, and had some chicken broth and chicken made up from earlier in the week.  This was easy and tasty ... I didn't have broccoli so just used some fresh asparagus.  Served with rice, it really hit the spot!  (But I still have to find out what agave nectar is ...)

This was yummy.  We will definitely have it again.  Changes required:  couldn't locate the agave nectar, but it really seemed to lack nothing!  Used lime juice, but no lime garnish.  Otherwise, made it as written.

I made this soup with oyster sauce instead of fish sauce. It still came out delicious. The red curry and the coconut milk taste great together. Yummo!

We substituted tofu for chicken, added ginger, and left out the fish sauce. Yummy!

This is a great recipe, I did not have all the ingredients so I used what I had on hand. I had lemon juice, basil, spinach,  celery, carrots, onion, kidney beans, corn. Also I only had yellow curry paste and just 1 can of coconut milk so I used more chicken stock. I did have fish sauce which i don't think you can do without. The soup still turned out great even with all the changes which is an indication of a good solid recipe. Would definitely recommend.

This was really good. I did have to double the amount of chicken broth in order to get it to be soup though.

Great, healthy recipe.  Substituted light coconut milk, oyster sauce for the fish sauce, and poached the chicken separately for some added flavor.  Followed the recipe otherwise, and worked great.  Added some rice noodles, but they ended up being difficult to eat with the other chunks in the soup.   Will definitely make this again!

The soup was delicious but lacking some spice to it. Our local thai restaurant makes theirs warm enough to make your nose run, so I think I will add some red chili oil next time to give it that heat. I used sesame oil instead of grapeseed, and did not add agave nectar and definitely more red curry paste than it called for. All in all a great recipe to make and then tweek to your personal preference!
