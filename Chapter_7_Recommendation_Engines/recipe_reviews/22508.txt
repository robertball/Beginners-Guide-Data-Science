I cut this recipe in half. I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the all of the sugar and the warm water milk for ten minutes, then added the remaining ingredients. This dough needed a half cup more flour to get it into a solid ball that could be kneaded with the dough hook. I kneaded the dough with the hook for about five minutes. After kneading, I set the dough to rise on a warm heating pad, covered, in a greased bowl for an hour. After the dough doubled, I plopped the dough out of the bowl, formed the dough into knots as the recipe stated, then set them to rise on greased baking sheets on the warm heating pad again for a half-hour. After baking, I brushed every knot with vegetable oil to give it a soft top. These turned out BEAUTIFUL. This was a slow rising dough but the end result was wonderful--light and fluffy with the best flavor. It's a little sweet for a dinner roll for us but honestly, big deal. This would make an excellent breakfast sweet roll. GREAT recipe!

These were extremely good, especially after brushing and spreading butter on them. I do wish they where easier and less time consuming, but which homemade breads are. 
When I make breads, I turn the oven on to its lowest setting, place the dough inside, they rise beautifully and take less time to double. But, make sure you place a clean damp kitchen town on top of the bowl or the dough will develop a crust which will prevent it from rising properly.

This recipe made great rolls.  The dough was sticky throughout the kneading process and I only added enough flour to keep my hands from sticking as I kneaded.  I divided the dough into thirds, then divided each third into 16 balls.  Went a lot faster than making knots, but the two knots I did make were great too.  Just make sure not to add too much flour and overknead or the dough will become tough.  It is not the smooth playdough type of bread dough.

I made these for Thanksgiving and again a short time after.  They were a big hit.  I will be making them again for Christmas dinner.  The only thing I did differently was I put egg yolk on the rolls before I put them in the oven, that made them have a nice color and shine to them.  They are great, I didn't have any problem with them being too yeasty or hard.

The receipie was good. The dough was a great taste, the only caution I would give is to make sure the oven IS NOT too hot. Watch rolls carefully, as I burned the bottoms and the tops were undercooked.

These turned out really badly when I tried them.  They were hard as rocks and didn't have the fluffiness I was looking for.

I made a ton and shared them with neighbors and they LOVED them. I had a 7 year old ask me to please send more when I bake them again. What a great feeling. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe and for helping me put a smile on all of my nieghbor's faces especially the 7 year old.

the ingredients calls for 2 eggs.  the recipe makes no mention of them.  I am new at baking so I am not sure if those are used for basting or what.  I am letting my dough rise right now, so I will let you know how it turns out.

I must have made this a dozen times now. I do a half batch in the bread maker (dough setting only), then turn it out onto a lightly floured counter top, cut it into 16 pieces, roll "snakes" and tie in knots, and bake in a greased 13x9 pan. They turn out beautifully each and every time. I've taken to substituting bacon grease for the butter in the dough portion of the recipe and it's delicious. This is my go-to roll recipe and I'm thrilled with how quick and easy it is.

I really liked this recipe.  It reminded me a lot of a roll I had growing up at a friends house. I was worried the rolls would be too sweet based on reviews but they actually are only slightly sweet.  These rolls are 10x better if you sprinkle onion soup on top! If you like this recipe you must try it with the onion.  If you don't have the soup you could use dried onion and some beef or vege bullion powder 2:1 and a little pepper. The rolls cooked for me in about 10 min.  I would have had burned rolls if i let them go for 15. You must keep an eye on these they cook really fast. Also be generous when you brush them with butter it will keep them a little bit softer longer.

These rolls came out great and they made an extra large batch.  I made them in the knot shape and they baked up very nicely.

My family and I have now determined this is one of our favourites and the first time I made it I did it in about 3 different ways.  Awesome for cinnamon rolls or clover leaf buns and especially my spirals.  Awesome recipe and now in our family book

I made these rolls in a half batch and my kids ate them so fast they didn't have time to cool! So, I'm making a full batch today. They taste like the delicious sweet rolls served at O'Charie's Restaurant. My problem is that the dough is so wet and sticky that I can't even knead it! I finally gave up, after making a big mess and let my Kitchenaid do it. I added and extra 3/4 cup of flour, but no more for fear they would get tough. Even then it was too sticky. It makes it very hard to handle. Am I doing something wrong? They are very yummy though and worth the trouble.

We love this and my picky older son that's 5 decided this was his favorite roll. I freeze a large part of the recipe and reheat. I've also made some of the dough into cinnamon rolls for a tasty breakfast.

These are AMAZING!! I halved the recipe and used rapid rise yeast like another reviewer said. I also put the covered bowl on a heating pad to rise so I only had to wait about 45 min instead of an hour. After putting the knots on my baking sheet, I put them back on the heating pad to rise again.

I brushed them with butter when they were done. Wow!! They are so good! My husband saw them and said "Please tell me you didn't make these for someone else!" Nope, all for the two of us! :) We both had 4 each straight out of the oven! Good thing I halved the recipe because they are super addicting.

Just enough sweetness to remind me of the rolls that Chick-Fil-A uses in their minis.

These rolls had a good taste and were pretty easy to make, however mine spread out too much for me instead of puffing up.  I did just try to make them into rolls instead of tying the knots (to save time,) but others said they did this and seemed happy with their results...  I'm not sure if I did something wrong?  Anyway, next time I'd bake them in muffin tins so the roll couldn't spread so much, and I bet I'd give them a higher rating then.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are THE BEST ROLLS EVER!!!  My husband knows it is a special occasion when I make these and I am ashamed to say that we have eaten just these for dinner because they are SO GOOD!  This dough is also great to make cinnamon rolls with.  I hope you enjoy them as much as we do.

This was first attempt at bread, so I was looking for a recipe that was relatively easy...which this was!  I was so impressed with how these turned out, especially since I had to make these entirely by hand.  I used a tad less sugar, based on reviews and they were still nice and sweet.  The only downfall is that after 24 hrs they are really only good for toast...awesome toast, mind you!  Thanks for sharing!

This is my favorite bread recipe ever.  It is wonderful.  I baked them for my Granny's birthday last, and they were over half gone 10 minutes after I took them out of the oven.  The recipe is versital, I use it for bierocks, loafs bread, rolls, sticky buns, pizza crust, whatever I need bread dough for.  I kneed the dough with the dough hook on my mixer, and that makes a big difference in how the bread turns out.

A previous review said they didn't know what to do with the eggs.  It says in step 2 what to do with them.

I made this dough into two braided loaves, and they turned out just as nice as many of the other egg breads I've tried--very light and feathery, but perhaps a tad sweeter because there's so much sugar.

Cut the recipe in half, followed exactly except that I brushed the knots with butter both before and after baking. They were perfect!

The description of splitting the dough in 1/3s, then 14 pieces, etc was confusing, but I just made ropes and created knots. The dough was just right and they had the best flavor. Thank you!!

I was surprised as to how dense these were, but the taste was amazing. One batch made about 42 rolls for me, so I may cut this in half next time. Overall, this was a very nice recipe.

I love this recipe!! I had to bring these rolls to a family function where my mom has always brought the best rolls...SHE asked for the recipe! They were simple and the dough is so silky.  We used half the batch for cinnamon rolls and we devoured those as well.  Delicious!

Every Easter I attempt to make an exceptional yeast roll.  I have come close but ususally I am disappointed in the final result.  This year I finally nailed it and will do away with all other recipes.  I followed this to a "T" and gave plenty of rise time.  Just excellent.

I have made these 2 times, first time I switched out 2 cups of flour for spelt flour and the other with 2 cups wheat flour, both times they were delicious. (I liked spelt flour better). They were gobbled up lickety split for Christmas and even my MIL loved them!

These were pretty good, but turned out a little dense for me.  I think perhaps I didn't let them rise enough.

This recipie is sooo easy & works everytime! I don't use any other recipie for rolls.  Sweet, flaky, and delicious!  HIghly recommend trying this.  They don't last long so I usually make double the batch & use my bread machine.  Easy!  Yummy :)

I made this for Thanksgving, and it turned out perfectly. Everyone loved them. They were relatively easy to make, too. The only down I could say is they are much better fresh than as leftovers, but nonetheless we ate them and enjoyed them.
