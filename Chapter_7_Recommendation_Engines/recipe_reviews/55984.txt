I tried this recipe along with the entire Thanksgiving menu and loved it.  I didn't even test out the recipe before I served it to my guests.

My mom just brought me back a whole bunch of dried chiles from Santa Fe and I wanted to use them....well, I don't know if the kind I had were just too pungent or what because the chili puree turned out so spicy I could barely eat my soup!  I thought the base recipe with the squash, coriander, and leeks was scrumptious, though.  I was just sorry I put the chili puree in at all because it overwhelmed the delicate flavors of the soup itself.  I will make this soup again, but without the chili puree next time!  Four stars for the soup itself, though.

Great Recipe (go Sunset!)
I used half butternut squash and half pumpkin. The chili puree is delicious.
