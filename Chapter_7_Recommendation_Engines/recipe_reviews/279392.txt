The muffins turned out great. Very moist and tasty. I used all purpose flour instead of wheat flour and only had raisins. 
I will make these again.

Will absolutely bake again. What a fun recipe! I added chopped pecans, chopped dried cherries and cocoa nibs instead of walnuts and raisins. I also used an ancient grain flour mix instead. Though the brown butter was awesome, Iâ€™m going to try half the amount and add unsweetened applesauce for other half, as they came out a little greasy for my liking.

What a fun recipe! I used what I had at the house, an ancient grain flour. Also instead of raisins and walnuts, I added chopped pecans, chopped cherries and cocoa nibs. Though the brown butter was awesome, next time o make these, I will do half as much butter and other half swap applesauce. I little too greasy for my liking.

Wonderful. Moist. Hearty.  I used 1/3 cup coconut flour with 1/4 cup coconut water instead of 1 cup whole wheat flour. Extra 5 minutes cook time to perfect the spring.  I've never used that method before works great!
