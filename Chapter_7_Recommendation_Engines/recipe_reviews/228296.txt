I guess I put my own spin on this, but it came out great.  Hadn't eaten brussel sprouts since I was a child and I recall disliking them.  I cut the brussel sprouts in half and set them aside. I cooked the bacon til it was crispy, then set to the side and crumbled it.   When the bacon was done, I put the sprouts in bacon grease flat side down and added a dab of margarine/butter so there was enough grease, then added chopped/minced garlic, pepper and a garlic salt to taste.  Flipped them over to cook the other side.  Added the bacon a minute or 2 before the brussel sprouts were done, and then drained all the grease.  They were amazing.  Still had a nice, soft crunch, because we hate soggy veggies, and the flavor was great.  Left out the chicken broth all together.  Again, just my spin on it.  But the basics for the recipe were awesome.

These were absolutely delicious!  Our garlic is big and beautiful right now, so I cut the recipe back by 2 cloves and it was almost too much.  Apart from the garlic (and a little more chicken broth), I didn't change a thing.  My husband and I agree, it tasted even better the next day!  In the future, I'll make it ahead so flavors have time to blend more.  A definite keeper.  Thanks for submitting it!

Vegetable of choice (in this case Brussels sprouts) + bacon + garlic = you can’t go wrong.

YUM! I halved the recipe b/c I'm the only one here that likes Brussels sprouts, and that worked out fine. I didn't measure the salt and pepper, just went by taste. Will def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This needs more chicken stock as it cooks off and the garlic burns. The brussel sprouts need to be parboiled. After 15 minutes mine were still really firm and under cooked. The flavors are good, (who doesn't like bacon in anything?). just need an adjustment on the cooking method.

Like making these sprouts. I usually double the recipe but only cook 13 pieces of bacon. Then I omit all the butter/olive oil and just cook the sliced garlic in the drippings. I cook the broth down, instead of draining, and then stir in the crumbled bacon. My man, who isn't a fan of Brussels sprouts at all, loves them prepared this way.

I never knew Brussels Sprouts could taste this good.  My Brussels Sp.- hating-husband absolutely loved these. I changed only the way I cook my sprouts.  After cleaning them, cutting an X in the core, I steamed them in a microwave steaming bag.  Meanwile, I'd cooked the bacon, and sauteed the garlic in the butter and olive oil. Added a bit of chicken broth to the sauteed garlic, halved the sprouts, stirred them into the butter/oil/broth to re-heat them, served them with the bacon bits and just a drizzle of the bacon grease.  This veggie dish was an accompanyment to a Kielbasa ring, and served with a side of buttered toast. I used about a dozen large sprouts. 3 slices of bacon, an guestimated the oil and butter to sautee 2 large garlic cloves.  I will for sure make this again.

First time cooking fresh Brussels Sprouts was a success! I followed the recipe but omitted the last butter and sautéed cooked bacon with the sprouts before serving. Would add more garlic in the future!

This was the first time I had ever cooked brussel sprouts. I followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious!! I will definitely be cooking this dish again!!!! Next time, I will put my own twist on it and add just a tad more garlic and salt. It was easy and it's always nice to be complimented on what a great cook you are, just by following a simple recipe. :). If I can make it, anyone can. I'm no Emeril in the kitchen, but this made me look like a pro!! Lol

I would recommend cutting the cooking time for the Brussel sprouts in half if using a cast iron skillet. Also keeping some of the leftover bacon fat helps to make the flavor from the bacon get absorbed in the veggies. It was delicious!

Wow! Followed the recipe. Perfection! Used Brussel sprouts fresh from the stalk. This is going to be a staple in this house as long as I can get the freshest sprouts!

Well, I've made this recipe a few times now and we love Brussels sprouts! I can't believe I'd never had them before and now we've been eating them a few times a month. This recipe made the request list for Christmas dinner in a few days. That should tell you how good they were :)

I cooked the Brussels sprouts in the bacon grease instead of butter and omitted the garlic.  My guests devoured the dish and it made me very popular!  I will prepare it again, thanks for the recipe.

This is the best recipe for Brussels  sprouts I have tried, first time making this recipe, did not alter anything but the chicken stock. Used 1 cup, and a slight tad over 1.5 pds of fresh sprouts, did not drain, let stock cook down and added butter and bacon. Restaurant quality, and a great source of iron. 

Flavor was outstanding! Thank you! Will definitely use this recipe as my first go-to, with these little green gems :)

Delicious and easy! The only thing I changed is that I added sautéed onions to mine, which adds a great flavor. Definitely making this again.

If you love bs, you will love this! I did use chicken boullion and skipped the water as well as the extra salt. The steam alone was enough to add moisture but not drowned the sprouts. EXCELLENT! !

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I've made it three times in the last two weeks. The only changes I made to this recipe were I used 1/2 salt and I omitted the butter. I also used pre-cooked bacon that I heated through in my microwave and crumbled over the top of the brussel sprouts when they were done cooking.

This is a great way to enjoy sprouts and I'm happy I found this.

I am always trying to find new ways to make brussel sprouts so my kids will enjoy them. Well, we made this for Thanksgiving this year and my boys tried it (7 and 11 yrs old) and they loved it and asked that I only serve them like this from now on. Very good recipe and I will definitely be making it again!

These were amazing!  When it came time to add the brussel sprouts, I let them fry some and brown up before adding the chicken broth. Then, I added less broth and let the liquid cook down so no need to drain off extra liquid. Delicious!

My boyfriend likes Brussels Sprouts. I have only ate them once before and did not care for them.  Bought some for him and was lucky to find this recipe.  I added green beans that we needed to finish up and used an entire small can of the chicken broth. I allowed it to simmer with a lid on about 3 minutes longer then the recipe required. It turned out well. I loved them. My boyfriend usually doesn't comment much on food but he stated how much he liked it as well. I definitely will use this recipe again. Thank-you so much!

I second patticakes43's method - I omitted the butter and oil, just using those amounts of drippings.  I covered the pan and shook it frequently while the sprouts simmered.  (Covering the pan prevents the liquid reducing too quickly - I uncovered to boil it off at the end.)

Very Very Good!  A great way to get used to the taste of brussels sprouts if you only have your childhood memories of eating them!

Just made this, and it was great.  I made it as unhealthy as you can because I used the leftover bacon grease (from only 3 slices of bacon) instead of butter and olive oil. Still lovely and will make again with Turkey bacon and the olive oil.  Thank you for sharing.

I have been cooking brussel sprouts this way without the bacon and broth for a few weeks now and loving it.  When I found this recipe I decided to try the addition of bacon and broth.  Neither one in my opinion enhanced the flavour of the BS in any way.  It just tasted like brussel sprouts with a side of bacon and the broth didn't add any flavour that I could taste from cooking them without.

Everyone enjoyed this, even the kids!!I used precooked bacon and homemade broth. I skipped the extra salt.  I added a dose of crushed red pepper for some heat.  Delicious, easy and a bit of a treat with the bacon - something we don't use much.

This will be the only way I will prepare brussel sprouts from here on!  I do believe the brand of bacon you use makes a difference and I only cook Wright’s apple smoked. I didn’t have fresh garlic so I seasoned with garlic salt instead of salt and again at the end. Perfect. Haha no pic because we devoured it!

I didn’t cut these in half because I had a bag of frozen, but I think next time I will use fresh and roast. I find Brussels sprouts are a little sweeter when roasted. But I would do everything else the same. Oh and I didn’t use olive oil, just used the same pan I fried the bacon in and used the drippings.

Delicious! I cut the Brussels sprouts in half and added diced onion with the garlic, sautéed it altogether , deglazed with chicken stock and finished roasting in a 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Once done, I sprinkled the bacon along with fresh Parmesan cheese and drizzled with balsamic glaze.

I made this but added 1/4 c of salted melted butter and added about 6 baby new (Red) potatoes cut in halves... This was also cooked in a Cast iron pan and the bacon caralmelized  with the maple syrup and was probably the best  and the easiest recipe Ive ever made. My friends are all making this now too!!

The amount of garlic was so overpowering no one could it eat. 

We fried bacon and onions first then tossed the sprouts in the pan, cooked it all together and it was much, much better.

We knew better than to use four cloves of garlic.

I parboiled the brussels sprouts like someone suggested. Much better. Just sautéed the bs & garlic then added the broth\cooked bacon. Cook down the broth. No need to drain. A couple pinches of crushed thyme too. Much better!

I made it with store-bought bacon crumbles, and it was still delicious! The brussels sprouts were perfectly tender and so tasty!

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was ok.  It didn't have the flavor that I was expecting, it tasted just like the regular brussel sprouts I steam and add butter to.  I couldn't taste the garlic and the bacon really didn't add anything. Perhaps my fresh brussel sprouts were too "strong" and I needed to add more garlic and bacon.
