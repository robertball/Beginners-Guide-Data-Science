Following the ridiculously simple recipe, I turned out a batch of puto that I could not keep away from friends. They were a hit.

I LOVED the flavor of these, but they were SO crumly I couldn't get them out of the pan, they just fell apart.  Any ideas as to what I did wrong???

Really easy to make! It's a bit sweet though so I recommend using just 1 cup of sugar.  The end result is really crumbly, which makes it very different from the real puto, but the level of difficulty makes up for its' texture.  Worth baking again but in a smaller batch.

These weren't done in 15 minutes like the recipe states...they were not even done in 30 minutes!  The middle of each one was caved in, and fell apart when I tried to remove them from the pan.

my mum usually makes this recipe and steams it instead, i find it usually keeps the cake moist (but u need to remove it from the tin before it cools otherwise it sticks)....by steaming it...normal milk was used instead of evaporated.

Followed the directions completely, save for the fact that I used regular flour not cake flour. They turned out beautifully and my husband couldn't get enough of them--neither could I!

This is a good recipe.  Following the instructions, I baked half of the mix resulting in dry, crumbly puto.  However, the steamed version in mini muffin pans was a success.  I'm still missing the lightness reminiscent of puto back home, and will try a recipe that calls for rice flour instead.

A nice Filipino Sweet Bread. I read up on it online before making and learned that cheese is served on top and with HB eggs on side sometimes. Yes more cooking time was needed/ use your cake testers. Yes it was hard to get out of pan. And there was some good steaming going on. Will try again but maybe grease/nonstick spray the loaf or muffin pans first. In the end a nice ethnic food, and the cheese on top was not bad with a sweet bread.
