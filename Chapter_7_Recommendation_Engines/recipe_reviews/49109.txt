I use 3 LBs of 31-39/pound shrimp...therefore, I create more sauce to taste (I haven't measured yet).  I also add about 1 tsp celery seed, 1/4 cup chopped bell pepper, 1/4 cup or more chopped fresh tomato, chopped red onion (or scallions) and ground black pepper to taste.  If you keep quick frozen, uncooked, shell-on, deveined shrimp in your freezer, this only takes a few minutes to put a last minute, quick lunch or dinner together for your family...I'll try it next time, but I have never let my salad sit for an hour.

I love shrimp salad and this was really delicious. I grabbed about eight large shrimp from my freezer (my lunch only) and added the rest of the ingredients to taste along with garlic and onion powders and a bit of cayenne. I topped crackers with the salad and then small slices of vermont cheddar and placed under the broiler. Oh so good!

Wow! This is really good shrimp salad. I've made it a few times to use on bagels and crackers. It is also good with minced dill or sweet pickles and crushed hard-boiled egg added to it.Thanks McCormick! Old Bay is perfect for everything it seems!

I minced the cooked shrimp and made this dish into an appetizer by stuffing mini pita pockets cut in half with the shrimp.  It was easy and everyone loved it!

This recipe was quick to prepare and very tasty. My husband called it one of the best shrimp salads he's ever had. I didn't have celery on hand but wanted something crunchy so I added in some chopped water chestnuts. I also added scallions, dried dill and some cayenne for a little kick. We were hungry so I only let it sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes and it was still very flavorful.

We love Old Bay, but this recipe could have used a little bit less than called for.  It was a bit too strong for our taste.  When we had the leftovers the next day, the shrimp salad was delicious.  Perhaps the extra time allowed the flavors to meld together.  Next time, I will definitely make ahead of time.  Thanks for the tasty recipe!

I scaled this to feed 20 people (7.5 lbs shrimp) and it was absolutely wonderful.  Rave Reviews!!!  It was time consuming to peel over 400 shrimp (I used the 51-60 count) but well worth the dollar savings.  Would definitely make again!

This is definitely the taste I was looking for in a shrimp salad.  But let me warn you all out there - when making your sauce try it first with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and taste - I found 2 teaspoons too much.  The Old Bay could be cut down by 1/2 teaspoon too.  I will make again!

Really tasty!  Added about 1/4 cup diced red pepper and one large chopped green onion for extra crunch and flavor.  Served over Romaine lettuce.  Made a great light lunch!

I absolutely love this shrimp salad.  Soooo simple & yummy.  I omit the celery b/c I am not a fan and add about 2-3 tablespoons of chopped vidalia onion.  Fabulous!  I make it at least once a week for lunch!

This recipe was far too salty and the Old Bay flavorings just oblitarated the taste of the shrimp. I was looking for something that tasted a little more delicate and upscale than this. Maybe scaling WAY back on the Old Bay and adding some fresh herbs would do it -- maybe dill or thyme. I'd advise that you add the Old Bay a little bit at a time and taste along the way. Let it sit in the fridge to let the flavors come together and then add more before serving if you like. You can always add seasoning, but you can't take it away.

Yum!!! Very simple and delicious. We had leftover steamed shrimp which were already seasoned with Old Bay, so I cut back on the seasoning in the recipe-I think 1 1/2 t. would be enough even with unseasoned shrimp, but it depends on how much Old Bay you prefer.  This is a perfect light lunch!

Great Recipe.  We are big Old Bay users.  I do think Old Bay can be a little strong.  I lessen the Old Bay in dressing mixture and then keep some available for those who'd like to sprinkle on a little more when served. I use this for straight shrimp salad or add pasta.  I increase dressing mixture for shrimp pasta salad

I went easy on the Old Bay, medium diced the shrimp, added finely chopped white onion and English cucumber (make sure to drain the cucumber or your salad will be watery), and served over avocado halves accompanied by Melba toasts and tomato wedges.  My husband raved about it.  It was a very satisfying meal.

Although it look promising, we did not enjoy this recipe.  It's needs a lot more flavor - perhaps a spice or garlic.  Maybe one could consider this a nice base recipe to add on to.

Just wonderful.  You must like the taste of Old Bay to enjoy this.  Make sure you do before you spoil good shrimp. I added some petit diced red, green, and orange pepper to the celery, and used about 1 1/2 tablespoons Old Bay (two seemed just a little too much for this recipe).  Served in a wedged tomato with avocado slices aound.  Bread and butter, lovely, light summer fare!

Really enjoyed this recipe, it was the kind of shrimp salad, I grew up with.  Now if you ask for shrimp salad at a resturant, they bring you a bed of lettuce with a few shrimp spinkled on top.
Thank you for helping me get a taste of the good old days.

Great quick meal! I love Old Bay. I've also made this with Nakano Roasted Garlic seasoned rice vinegar in place of the lemon for a nice variation.

This was truly an incredibly, tasty salad.  I served it with tortillas warmed in the oven and lightly dusted with Old Bay before filling with the salad.  Wonderful summer lunch dish, especially when served with cold Harvard beets and fresh fruit.

This is easy and delicious!  The red pepper in the Old Bay seasoning gives this recipe a light "bite" which I really liked. I used 3/4 pound of shrimp but cut the dressing receipe in half since my husband doesn't like a lot of mayo.  That still made enough dressing to nicely coat the shrimp.  We didn't eat it with crackers or anything.  We loved it all by itself!  I will make this again!

This wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. I cut way back on the Old Bay Seasoning as I thought 2 tsps sounded much too much, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We just didn't really care for the combination of flavors. Oh well, thanks anyway.

I made this for a work function, and everyone loved it.  I did add some chopped/minced shallots to add some zing.
