I tried this recipie and its true kids love them, but was a bit surprised because the pops did not come out very fudgy, or creamy, instead it came out very icy, hard and crystalized, so i tried experimenting with the recipie and came to the conclusion that if you fold in about 1 cup of whipped cream to the pudding mixture they will come out perfectly fudgy, and creamy just like those creamy fudgesicles we ate as kids.

This recipe is so good it makes you want to slap your Mama! I did change it a little. I used Splenda instead of sugar, used 2% milk and added 1 cup of Low fat Cool-Whip!  I just don't see how you could get it to taste any better than this! Thanks for the Recipe!

For those who thought these fudge pops weren't creamy enough, try mixing packages of instant chocolate pudding as directed on the box and freezing the pudding into pops. Incredible.

These are very good my kids loved them.  However, insead of using pudding mix I mix in a blender 3 cups skim milk, 1 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa, 1/4 cup cornstarch and a pinch of salt.  I then heat the mixture on the stove until it starts to thicken and then add 2 tbsp butter and 1 tsp vanilla.  I then pour this mixture (once it has cooled a little) into popsicle molds and freeze.  These taste very good and much better than when made with instat pudding mix.

With my changes I give it 5 stars.  I would give it 4 stars with the instant pudding.

You really don't need the added sugar it calls for. Grandma used to make homemade "pudding pops" for us kids, it's just making the boxed pudding mix and pouring it into your cups and freezing until firm, then sticking some stick in. Easy peasy. This will work for already prepared pudding, too. Just stick a stick into a Snack Pack and freeze. FYI: This is also the recipe on the Kraft website.

I used butterscotch pudding mix and added cool whip as others had recommended.  They were really good, my kids and husband loved them so much they lasted about 1 day.  I put heath bar toffee pieces at the bottom of the mold (I used small plastic cups) which added a nice extra touch.

This recipe is great if you don't want to have to wait for your cooked pudding to cool off before freezing.  I made the pudding with 1 1/2 c (like the pie directions)of chocolate milk and folded in 1 c of cool whip topping and mini chips.  I skipped the sugar because of the cool whip, and I didn't miss it at all!  These were easy and my toddler has loved them!

This is probably a very good recipe, however, I am a confirmed chocoholic and the chocolate pudding didn't seem to be all that sweet. Next time I will try adding some chocolate syrup or maybe some chocolate extract to the mix. Thanks Bea!

If you will use one small package of chocolate instant pudding and one can of evaporated milk, undiluted, (off the top of my head I'd say it's about 1 and 1/2 cups), your pudding pops will be creamy, and it's less expensive and more nutritious than adding whipped topping.  You can use non-fat evaporated milk, it's still good but it's not as creamy then.

Excellent Recipe! I made these with chocolate pudding and with butterscotch.  I thought they were exceptionally easy and tasted good too.  The richer the milk, the creamier the popsicle. I made them with nonfat milk and 1% and the 1% was creamier (less icey). Next time I will try 2%.  I haven't tried sugar free pudding with Splenda or Equal, but I am thinking about it.  I can't say these are better than the store bought kind, but with kids, these are the perfect snack on a warm day. Definiately better than homemade popsicles!!

Even I - the anti-chocolate member of the family could appreciate these yummy treats! If you don't have the plastic popsicle holders - go to a local dollar store ~ you can get 2 sets of 6 (thus - you can make a dozen fudge pops at a time) for $2.00 or less. Even after buying those- these are still cheaper (and just as good) as the store-bought ones! Will makes these plenty of times yet this summer! Thanks Bea!

Hmmmm doggie these were good. Just like the fudgeicles I used to get from the ice cream man when I was a kid. Made the recipe as directed. I filled up 13 3 oz solo cups. I rolled the cup in between my hands to warm up the sides of the cup so the fudgeicles would pop right out. Very kid friendly. My 4-year-old helped by adding the ingredients and having the cups ready. Make them, eat them, enjoy them.

I'm not sure who loves these more, my husband or my 3 year old!! This recipe made about 16 pops and they were gone in 2 days!  A definate hit, and much cheaper than buying fudgesicles.

Thanks for the great idea.  My kids went nuts for these.  I made the milk chocolate milk to add more flavor.  Used Hershey syrup, and made it pretty dark.  Also, used popsicle molds and it made 10.  Going to try other pudding flavors next.
** Used french vanilla pudding and used 1 1/2 c milk and 1 1/2 c fat free french vanilla creamer-excellent!

I gave it 5 stars after a few alterations from other reviews....I did add a cup of cool whip, which made them so creamy, but then it wasn't chocolatey enough so I added a few squirts of chocolate malt syrup and they were outstanding!!  My kids absolutely loved them and this will definitely be a treat we will make all summer long!!

I didn't add the sugar and used both "dark chocolate and white chocolate pudding" to make a swirled delight for the kids. I think homemade pudding would be better for these, but certainly not faster.

Great tasting popsicle if you can get them out of the popsicle molds.  This recipe made an even dozen and so far we were only able to get 2 out successfully.  But all in all a good recipe.  My 2 girls loved it!

These were okay.  They were a bit on the icy side, while I would have preferred them to be a little creamier.  There was no waste - with the hot weather, my kids and their friends ate these quickly!

This is what I did. 1 pkg chocolate fudge instant pudding, 1 can evaporated milk. I was surprised it wasn't very chocolatey. So I added a smidge of chocolate extract. They're in the freezer now, can't wait to try them!

This recipe is really easy to make. I added whip cream as other members suggested. 
After putting the mixture into the freezer I stirred it every 2 hours sothat it does not become one lump.

I absolutely loved these!! I used 1pint of whipping cream and fat free milk for the rest. when mixing, there were chocolate blotches on the surface. They would not go away and were left that way. When they came out, they were an extremely creamy, delicious ice cream. they did not stay on the popsicle stick, so scooped it out. The chocolate specks were the best!! I will make again over the summer.

Best homemade fudge bar! Yummy. I added 1/2 cup sugar-free Cool Whip and used Splenda for the sugar. Still a tad icy, but will make these again! Couldn't wait for them to freeze.

I'd like to rate this better. Taste wise okay to good but not bad. Was a bit worried with 3 cups of milk to it. However. I'd rate it a whole lot better if I could get the darn things out of the popsicle molds. I have 3 trays of pops literally stuck in the containers. None of them bonded with the popsicle sticks. I've used my molds for years and we've made more then a dozen batches of popsicles in the last few weeks. 1st ones not to come out on the sticks. Don't know what to say. Baffled.

I forgot to add the sugar, added plenty of whipped cream, and added a bit of peanut butter. It tasted great and was still sweet enough.

When making these for the rugrats, I like to layer in the cups slices of banana & pieces of maraschino cherries -- and voila!  You have a banana split fudge pop.  (Definitely blend in frozen whipped topping.)

This recipe is sooo easy and sooo good! 
Reminds me of those jello pudding pops we used to buy. 
And they are very inexpensive to make. We have been going through them so fast, I'm thinking of buying another popsicle mold so I can keep more in the freezer!

Awesome pops! They were fudgy and delicious. I added 1 cup cool whip to the pudding mixture, as some others suggested. There were still some lumps in it but I think it was fine. All the "kids" I gave them to loved the taste and texture, perfect for a hot summer day when you're craving chocolate!

These are delicious, but I agree with other reviews that you should just follow the directions on the pudding box (2 cups milk, no added sugar). Adding 1 cup of Cool Whip makes them less dense and hard. Yum!

I didn't have chocolate pudding mix, but I did have chocolate mint. The mix I used wasn't a 3.9 oz mix, it was 5.1 oz. So I added a little more milk and sugar. The pops were AMAZING!!! Although the chocolate mint mix had mint chocolate chips. I think that made the pops crunchy.They were still good though. They weren't crystalized at all and were fudgier than the ones at the store!(I didn't even add whipped cream!) Any ways...I loved it. Thanks for sharing!!!

When I was a kid my grandma would make these fudge pops during the summer. I never remember seeing her make them. But I remember the plastic container she froze them in. Maybe I never seen her make them because they are so quick and easy. Now my kids can enjoy Fudge pops just as much as I did as a kid. Thanks!

My kids will not let me stop making these. I do add 1 cup of cool whip for extra creaminess but follow the recipe otherwise. We've tried these with chocolate, banana and french vanilla pudding so far. Butterscotch will be next. Kids swear the chocolate  tastes just like a Frosty from Wendy's. Fussed with my popsicle molds the first time but have gone to the paper cups and popsicle sticks for ease and less clean up.  Great recipe.

Made as described. Very easy and I liked them better than store bought. Not terribly healthy, but at least I know what's in them.

I used a small Hersey's Special dark pudding mix and 12 ounces of evaporated milk.  These were very smooth and creamy, beating store bought ones hands down. My family loved these, so I'll be making them again.

Thanks so much for this reminder of a wonderful summer treat my sister & I used to make as kids! I had SO much fun making these with my grandkids this past weekend.. Based on some reviewers suggestions, we used the amount of milk called for on the pudding box, omitted the extra sugar,  folded in about a cup of whipped cream (whipped separately, first) and spooned the mixture into 3oz plastic bathroom cups. We got 15 treats this way! I put them in the freezer for about an hour, then inserted wooden craft sticks & left them in the freezer overnight.  My grandkids now think I'm a genius. Thank you!!!

I subbed 1% for whole milk. Very satisfied with the results, I would make this recipe again.
