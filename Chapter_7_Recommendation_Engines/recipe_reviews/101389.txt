This marinade is fantastic! I like to use center cut boneless pork loin.  After I marinade the pork (the longer the better), I then broil the chop until the fat on the loin gets nice and crispy (turning once during broiling).  I then cut it up into chucks and serve it over a bed of salad with some grated carrots, chopped scallions, toasted sesame seeds and a duck sauce dressing. Sometimes if I'm in the mood I'll drizzle some soy sauce over the salad & add small chunks of pineapple. (Kikkoman low sodium is the best because it has no high fructose corn syrup in it like all the other brands do).  I always top the salad off with some fried Chinese noodles.  It's absolutely delicious!!

This was amazing! My company and husband couldn't stop raving. I cut the chili powder and cumin to 1/2 tsp just because my company doesn't eat hot food. I added some green onions to the marinade and let the tenderloins sit in the marinade for about 4 hours, every hour I would massage the meat and flip the bag over. I cooked them on the BBQ at 350 indirect heat, on a tin foiled cookie sheet. I let them finish on the top rack over the heat to get the BBQ'D look. I served it with the chinese cabbage salad and fried rice with peppers and pinapple stirred in. Really great! I am going to mariande a whole chicken with this recipe and rotissere it! Yum.

I left the recipe and ingredients on the counter yesterday when I left for work and hubby had everything ready to throw on the grill when I got home from a stressful day.  He prepared the marinade exactly as written and refrigerated everything  for about nine hours.  He sliced the pineapple instead of cutting in chunks and just grilled the slices.  Everything was absolutely wonderful and hubby said he'd do it all again.

Impressive!   I thought this recipe sounded a little weird at first, but it came out great; very flavorful! I used regular boneless pork chops instead of the tenderloin and they were yummy. Thanks!

I scaled this recipe down for four servings, and used a 1lb tenderloin. I mixed up the marinade as written and marinated for about 6 hours. I would pierce the pork to allow the marinade to permeate more thoroughly. It produced a nicely flavored crust (really loved the flavor), but more flavor throughout the meat would have been preferable. Mine required much longer than the suggested 20 minutes. More like 40. We opted out on the grilled pineapple side skewers.

This was really pretty good! We are not big pork eaters but all loved this. It was a bit salty for our taste so I will decrease salt next time. I also used ground ginger instead of fresh and low sodium soy sauce. I cooked my pork along with marinade and had it over rice. I wasn't sure how it sounded, but it ended up juicy and flavorful.It might be worth mentioning that those of you that hate pineapple juice ( I have one in my house) didn't even know it was in there. It just really balances the other flavors nicely. It's a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! The only thing I did different was I didn't add the salt. I will make this recipe again after receiving rave reviews from all family members.   DELISH :)
