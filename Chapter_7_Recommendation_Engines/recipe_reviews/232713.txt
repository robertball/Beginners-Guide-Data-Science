Great recipe, the family loved it especially my grandson son who will not eat eggs. He said it was the best eggs he ever had.  I did make a mistake I bought Mozzarella cheese by mistake instead of swiss cheese.  tried it will swiss but we like it better with mozzerlla, Will continue with my error.

I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 inch square pan.  I goofed while following the recipe and stirred the sour cream into the eggs and milk.  It turned out okay but will try it again and follow the recipe exactly.

We have made this very tasty dish twice now and it is a crowd pleaser. The only critics were the kids....but the adults gave this dish rave reviews! Didn’t change a thing-it’s perfect as written.

This was so easy and delicious I will definitely be making it again.  Forgot to buy green onions so just sauteed some white onion I had on hand.  I also seasoned it up a bit with a little Herbs de Provence because something about this screams French to me.  Bon Apetit :)

1.1.16   wine/sherry definitely is way in the background, but the cheese is  upfront & center!  Love breakfast/brunch  dishes like this that can be prepared the day before, and this is a very different one. It was moist, cheesy, and just delicious.  Took the recipe author's suggestion and enjoyed it with a Mimosa for New Year's Day brunch.  Thanks for sharing, kayhayes26, we really liked this!

Big hit with my Sunday School class.  I think I omitted the ham because I forgot to buy it.   Making it again this week for quarterly breakfast.
