This is a wonderful, easy stuffed tomato recipe. I am surprised there isn't that many reviews. I used 4 medium tomatoes instead of 2 large. I had to use Italian sausage because that's all I had, I crumbled and browned before using in the stuffing. I was skeptical about using the cheddar with that, but I was so wrong. The flavor combo is great. I did grease the bottom of my dish with a bit of olive oil before placing the tomatoes. I will definitely make these again. A light sprinkle of basil on top the cheese also adds good flavor. My boyfriend who isn't fond of tomatoes had two. Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

The picture looked so delicious I couldn't wait to make the recipe even though I didn't have all the ingredients.  Instead of canned tomatos, I stuffed my red tomatos with diced yellow tomatos.  I used skinless turkey sausage.  I used less breadcrumbs, but added a few flavored (cheddar/garlic) croutons which created wonderful bites of flavor.  I also used colby/jack cheese.  This recipe is so easy to adapt, so don't be afraid to use the ingredients you have on hand.  Last thought, the less juice included (from tomatos) the better.  Enjoy!

I changed this recipe a lot.  You can do a lot of things to stuff the tomatoes.  I used ground chicken with bell peppers (all I had).  I didn't throw the stuffing of the tomatoes out, but used it later for another sauce for the next day.

My family loved this. I used regular Jimmy Dean sausage. About 3/4 of the roll. And Added over a cup of cooked rice in it. It was enough to stuff about 8 tomatoes. Very good!

Very nice mix of flavors but the sausage was overbearing.  I would half the sausage next time or use a very mild sausage.

This recipe executed well, my only problem is that the tomato is quite bland unless seasoned with some salt and pepper. So make sure you season the inside of the tomato before stuffing it.

I am not fond of tomatoes. My husband loves them. Therefore I gritted my teeth and made this. I made it vegetarian though because I had already made a meat portion to our meal. I substituted sausage with whole kernel corn. I ate all of it. It was, actually, pretty good. Flavorful. Juicy. Next time I am gonna try it with sausage. (like the recipe says) I can only imagine the mouth watering that will ensue.

It would really be nice if people would rate recipes on how they're written and now how they modify it.  This recipe, as written, is incredibly bland and texturally mushy.    It really needs some herbs and something to give it crunch - and the tomatoes are cooked at that undesirable state of neither crispy raw nor stewy cooked.  Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it.   Not worth the try.  Uninteresting.  There are much better recipes out there.

I was looking for a recipe to use up the giant tomatoes we had and this worked really well. I changed the recipe and did chicken instead of sausage. I also added spinach and balsalmic vinegar. Used italian bread crumbs. Very good. I also just cut up the insides of the tomatoes instead of opening a can. Seemed like such a waste just to throw the insides away when they are perfectly usable. Just rinse them off so they are not too juicy.

Although I have made some changes (ground beef instead of sausage, spices, etc), this is a recipe I have returned to multiple times (and look forward to making every time tomatoes are in season!)

I was expecting better, but there were just alright. My tomatoes needed to cook way longer than the suggested 15 min. And I didn't care for the soggy mushy bread crumbs... I don't think I will make them again.

Did not use canned tomatoes. I reserved the gut of the tomatoes and browned two banana peppers with the sausage. I stuffed leftover vegetables from the garden then topped with parsley.

I made this recipe as is and also using vegetarian sausages as I was cooking for a friend who is vegetarian. I loved it! (the vegetarians ones weren't as good in my opinion, but my friend really liked them too). I ended up adding more cheese because the amount the recipe gave wasn't enough for me. However, this delicious recipe is not very good as leftovers. I would suggest only making as many as you're going to eat that meal. It absolutely does not save well, other than that this recipe is great!

The recipe was ok. I would add something else to the filling like rice. The bread crumbs just came out mushy.

Great recipe! Will definitely use it again in the future. Using corn in replacement to the sausage sounds like a good option, will look into that next time.  

Tip: We transferred the tomatoes into a muffin tray to stop them from rolling. But if you cut the bottoms of the tomatoes slighty, that can also prevent them from rolling and spilling over during baking ;)

I'm giving it 5 stars because I love the idea, but I altered the recipe to fit my tastes; the recipe is versatile enough to do this.  I had a nice firm tomato, so I just diced the insides instead of using any canned tomatoes.  I added bell pepper and mushrooms as I do not eat meat.  I did use cheddar cheese, but instead of break crumbs I crushed a few croutons because they were seasoned. I didn't add many croutons and I don't think the recipe would have suffered without them. Still, that's up to personal taste.  When I was eating a threw a homemade falafel on the top just because it was there.  I loved it.  Next time, I would think of replacing the sausage with falafel pieces. Now, I am thinking of doing this with stuffed bell peppers as well.  :)

This was real easy to make and quick. I diced fresh hot peppers in the stuffing w/ stewed tomatoes diced up. I also used the left over stuffing in some hot peppers and sooked the same way and they turned out great.

My husband loved them, but I didn't care for them too much. I was hoping the tomato would taste more like a cooked tomato than an uncooked tomato.

We had this for dinner last night but don't think I'd make it again.  There was to much stuffing left over after I filled the tomatos.  I cooked the left over stuffing separately and it tasted pretty good because it got crispy in the oven.  The stuffing that was inside the tomatos wasn't that great.  It was too runny and kind of bland.

This recipe is a keeper!  I used smoked turkey sausage to make it a little healthier.  Also, I didn't have any can tomatoes so I used insides of the tomatoes.  I just put them in a pot, added my favorite spices, simmered for about 30 minutes or less. Drained some juice and it worked out great!  Thanks for this recipe.  Kids and husband loved it.

This was a very pleasant surprise. I used regular breakfast sausage because it was what I had in the house. I also used my garden chunky salsa instead of canned tomatoes. I was thrilled with the outcome and so was my family. This recipe is a definate keeper expecially for those of us with summer gardens!

I regret having to give this simple recipe a poor review. There is no texture. There is almost no flavor. Of the three people I made this for none asked for seconds and two said I should not make it again. Apologies, this is just not worth making.

These stuffed tomatoes are delicious.  I used andouille sausage and instead of the canned tomatoes, I  used the scooped out pulp.  I drained the pulp of excess liquid.  I cooked at 400 for about 20 minutes and then turned the oven to 350 and cooked for another 10 minutes.   This is definitely a " do again".

So good! Use the insides of the tomato with peppers rather than the canned rotel and this would be 5 stars! I have made this with or without the sausage and both are delish!! Thanks for the idea. So good. I even tried them with grits and bacon inside. So many ways to jump start a great idea.

I was looking for a new recipe to use up some tomatoes that were going bad and I would definitely make these again. The recipe is a great base and can easily be adjusted to what you want to use up or have on hand. I used sweet Italian sausage with Gouda cheese, omitted the breadcrumbs, added onions and the insides of the tomatoes. Mmm!

This was a very tasty dish for how simple the recipe was. Instead of sausage I used bacon, and instead of bread I used crumbled crackers. It was so surprising how filling and delicious it was! Great make!

We loved this recipe! I used ground sausage, browned in a frying pan to make sure it would be done all the way through before adding it to the mixture. Turned out great. Will try to add something like precooked wild rice next time to give a little more depth, but overall was a great alternative to stuffed bell peppers, which was exactly what I was looking for!

These were tasty. I would recommend about twice as much sausage. I had some ricotta on hand so I mixed  that with the meat/breadcrumb mixture and it gave the center a great gooey texture.

I really liked this one. I used ground mild Italian sausage and browned it first. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and diced some of my own garden tomatoes in addition to the canned since I was tripling the recipe. This is great stuffed in green peppers as well but you will need to bake it longer for the peppers to soften.

Delicious!  This is a great way to use up my summer farmer's market tomatoes.  I have made it with and without sausage (one the days I have forgotten to take sausage out of the freezer) and its always good.

Used cooked pork sausage instead of smoked sausage and farmers cheese on top. Also doubled the bread crumbs. Turned out perfect, cant wait to have them again!!!! Next time I'm adding cooked spinach.

Delicious! The only change I made was that instead of using smoked sausage, I browned mild Italian sausage and used that. Wow! Incredible!

My 20 year old son and his girlfriend made this for dinner last night, and I was skeptical since I don't like cooked tomato.  They forgot the breadcrumbs, so I suggested crushed Ritz crackers (worked very well).  They added quite a lot of cheese, and the end result was wonderful! These will definitely be made again!

Made it as written and it was very good! A little spicy for us so next time I'll use the italian style diced tomatoes.

Not too thrilled with this.  I have decided I am not a fan of cooked tomatoes in general- too watery and bland.  but I did not like the taste of the filling that much either....

I think the recipe called for far too much breadcrumbs.  My hustband and I both didn't care for this.
