The topping on this pie is fantastic.  The pumpkin filling NEEDS pumpkin pie spice.  I made it according to the recipe without any changes, and the pumpkin filling was SO BLAND it was awful.  A couple of teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice would make this one terrific pumpkin pie!

Pumpkin Pie is not my favorite but I have made this pie twice and everyone likes it. I think it's a good pie, love the topping. I made it exactly the way the recipe said and will continue to make it that way.

I liked the pecans in the crust of this pie and will add them to future pumpkin pie crusts, but I didn't think the struessel topping was worth the trouble.  My family wasn't crazy about this pie either.  I'll go back to the traditional pumpkin pie.

This pie has great potential. The streusel topping was tasty, but the filling needed to be sweeter to actually taste like pie. Perhaps adding some white sugar to the filling along with some pumpkin pie spice. I'm willing to try this recipe again....

I overmixed the streusel mixture for the topping. Be careful or it will turn very clumpy. I probably should try this one again.

This is a different kind of pumpkin pie, but definitely delicious, I couldn't stay out of it!  I used a store bought crust, so I just sprinkled the pecans on top of the crust before filling with the pumpkin.  It was almost too much streusel topping, but since the filling isn't sweet, it works.

The filling on this is really bland with no spices and it is a very soft filling.  Not custard like at all.  The topping was very good when first baked but the filling was sloppy - chilled over night and the filling set up better but then the topping wasn't crunchy any more.

Loved the crumbles on top. This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. The crubs broke up the pumpkin a bit, which can sometime seem bland because of the consistancy of the texture. This was like a cross between the sweetness of the pumpkin and the best part of an apple crubs cake: the crumbs!

I looked forward to this pie and I'm sorry to say I really didn't
like it.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  The balance between the
crunchy topping and the  soft pumpkin filling was off IMO.
If I were ever to make it again, which I doubt, I would decrease
the amount of pumpkin filling and increase the amount of
topping.

Missed the sweetened milk and used regular. Turned out not too sweet and enjoyed. Must chill the pie before adding crumbles as they sink otherwise. Crumbles were hard to spread evenly enough as it was. Still a hit however and will make again.

This pie was super easy to make. I was a little worried it'd be overly sweet with the sweetened condensed milk, but it was perfect. The pie filling's simplicity allowed for more of the pumpkin's flavor to shine, and the streusel added the perfect texture. 

I did add about a 1/4 tsp of ginger to the pie filling which I don't think made a bit of difference in the flavor- I just got scared it'd be too plain! I wouldn't bother with it again. I also added about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg to the streusel which I think was a great call, and a bit of salt to both the streusel and the filling. 

I'd definitely make it again!

I baked a pumpkin and pureed it fresh for this recipe.  Without having read any other reviews, I actually added some pumpkin pie spice after tasting the filling (just a scant 1/2 tsp.)  I used a store bought crust.  MAKE SURE you use a deep dish pan!
* Hubby said this was the best pie EVER.* I can't believe how light (almost mousse-like) it is.  Can't wait to make it again for the holidays.

Between the streusel topping and the condensed milk, this pie was a little too sweet for our tastes. It was good, but it tastes alot like the sweet potato casserole dish we southerners make for holidays at home--and that recipe definitely doesn't need a replacement. It was really interesting and different...but I think I'll stick with my old fashioned pumpkin pie recipe. Thanks, though!

This was too much like eating a mashed pumpkin w/a crumb topping.  Too pumpkinny and not enough pie goodness.  Don't try this if you're in the mood for "pumpkin pie."

This is by far THE best pumpkin pie I've ever had.  I did add spices to the pie filling (cinnamon and nutmeg), but that was the only change.  This will become our traditional pumpkin pie!

This pie was very attractive.  However, the taste left something to be desired.  It needed spices of some sort in the pumpkin.  And the texture of the pumpkin filling was yuck!  It needed eggs or something.  It was almost just like eating the pumpkin from the can.
