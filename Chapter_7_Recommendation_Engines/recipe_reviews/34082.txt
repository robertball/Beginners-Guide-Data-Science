I would not have thought of the beer & butter combination, but my boyfriend loves anything cooked in beer. I also added a clove of garlic. It has been my experience that 30 minutes is way too long to cook chicken over a good grill.  I cut the cooking time to 10 minutes, and that was too long, (I pounded the chicken breasts pretty thin.) I will try this again cooking for maybe 7 minutes total.

The most moist chicken I have ever grilled!  I used olive oil instead of butter and marinated for 4 hours and skipped the peppers.  My son never eats grilled chicken and asked for seconds!

Only used 1 can of beer (I don't usually like the taste with my food) and I marinated for a little longer (on accident).  Used hickory steak seasoning and it turned out great.  Thanks for the post.  Will be making again.

I really liked this, though the cooking time is too long for chicken breasts.

We don't care much for chicken, but this we liked.  I added a few drops of smoke flavoring because I used the indoor grill.

I didn't think this had any flavor.  I followed the recipe and let the chicken sit for about 30 minutes before grilling.  Since it makes so much marinade I did put the rest in the freezer with additional chicken.  I won't make it again though.

Disappointing at best. Too much beer for the amount of spices. Would be better if the "sauce" were thicker and held on to the meat better. Okay flavor, but nothing great. I won't be using this one again.

I can't say that my boys asked for seconds but the adults all liked it.  It was quick and easy and the recipe made almost twice what I needed so I put some chicken breasts in the freezer to marinate for another night.  All in all a good quick recipe for a night you are in a pinch.

Not bad, it was very moist, but not very flavorful. I used only one bottle of good beer - maybe that was the problem.

Thanks Donald for your recipe, this was very good.  Took another's advice and used olive oil instead of butter.  Also I marinated the chicken for 4 or 5 hours.  I used Montreal steak seasoning and along with seasoned salt I thought it would be too much, but it wasn't at all.  Very tasty.  I don't care for 'spicy' foods.  I grilled on low for a good 20 minutes basting quite a few times.  My husband says this is a keeper!!

I prepared grilled boneless chicken breast using this recipe.  They were moist and delicious.  I would not change a thing.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I will use this one from now on when grilling chicken.

The sauce smelled so yummy when I heated it on the stove. I also added a crushed clove of garlic.  Although the chicken was very,very juicy, it was essentially flavorless. I would probably make this again but marinate the chicken in the sauce in the fridge for a few hours.

I was looking for a different kind of chicken recipe and came across this one. It was very good - I will make again! Although next time, I will cut the amount of butter down (I didn't really like the buttery flavor with the beer taste). Also, I added some additional spices - about half an extra tbsp of steak seasoning, and a tbsp of Italian seasoning. I also cooked it for about half the time on an indoor grill and it turned out pretty good. My husband suggested adding chili powder next time, so I will be trying that as well. Good recipe, thank you for sharing!

Very, very moist chicken is the result.  Great aroma, flavor not quite as strong as I would've liked but I used a light American lager and will use a flavorful ale next time such as Sam Adams Summer Ale.

Substituted vegetable oil for the butter and made it my own with the seasoning (with a hint of hot sauce). Great recipe.

This was the BEST grilled chicken I've ever had!  Even my VERY picky 4-year-old ate half a chicken breast.  I used half butter and half extra virgin olive oil, and let the chicken marinate for about 4 hours before grilling.  Blue Moon beer works wonderfully with this recipe.  My husband and I both agree this is a definite keeper and the tastiest, juciest grilled chicken ever.  THANKS!

Nice flavor, the chicken came out very juicy and tasty. I did have to bake the chicken. Darn grill was broken when hubby went to start it up :( But baking worked. I baked at 350 and basted every 10-15 minutes. Baked for about 45 minutes. Thanks for the recipe. Oh and I forgot the green peppers. OOps.

Needed extra seasoning, I added extra on top while it was cooking and basted as directed.  Doesn't need to cook as long as it says on directions.

This is a really good way to shake up boring grilled chicken!  I used half of the beer listed and marinated my chicken tenders for 30 minutes in the mixture and basted them every time I turned them on the grill.  I served with a side of fresh tomatoes and onion chopped under ranch dressing and buttered, herbed noodles.  YUM-O!

We cooked this exactly as the recipe stated the first time we made it, and it was great, but the second time my boyfriend decided to DRINK the last beer we had, so I used white wine instead, I was kinda worried about it drying out, but it turned out GREAT!  We also used cajun seasoning instead of seasoning salt and steak seasoning, and we added onions to it.  I would recommend this recipe, in any variation, if you are a fan of grilled chicken or veggies!  Very easy, very moist and very tasty! **I love how moist this recipe is, but was really craving BBQ chicken last night.  I decided to 'modify' this since it always turns out so moist, into a bbq recipe.  I seasoned the chicken w/ salt, pepper, cavendars, garlic powder, and bbq spice, and then let it marinate in beer for a couple of hours.  Cooked, and added bbq the last 5 minutes it cooked.  It was PERFECT bbq chicken!  Nice variation on this already terrific recipe!

It was good! I was breaking in a new electric grill and put the chicken on to soon. So it took twice as long as I expected to cook. As for the chicken it was exactly what I was hoping for. I’ll add a little more salt next time.

This marinade was wonderful and the result was a flavorful, moist chicken breast.  The cook time is too long & I left off the green peppers, but I will definitely use the marinade again!

Sorry, guys, but we didn't care for this at all.  I doubled the seasonings, but all we could taste was butter.  I was looking forward to a nice flavorful chicken breast, but it was one of the most bland things I've had in quite some time.

Very easy and tasty.  I used on thighs (boned), so flavor was a little milder I think.  But, a big hit with the family!

I just made this tonight, and it didn't get good reviews from my husband and son.  My son didn't like it and my husband said it had no flavor.  I thought it had a light beer taste; it wasn't bad, but nothing great.  I followed the recipe except I used olive oil instead of butter.  I did marinate the chicken for about an hour.  I think it would have been great if the flavor was a little stronger; maybe if the chicken was marinated over night, or it could be because I used Miller Lite and should have used a stronger beer.  Thank you for the recipe; I just might try it once more with a different beer.

This recipe makes enough for about 6 pounds of chicken!  The smell is a little weird, probably depending upon the kind of beer you select.  The chicken ended up very moist and had just enough flavor.  I will probably use this again.

The flavor was great and the meat was super moist, but so much waste! I'll use the "basics" of this recipe again, because it truly was delicious, but I'll never make it again as written.

Wow.  This was fantastic!  I dont normally like peppers, but it really complimented the taste of the chicken.  The only change I made to the recipe was I cut in in half, and also grilled the peppers on some foil and brushed it with the marinade mixture.  This is definately going to go in the rotation!

If I were to sum up this recipe in one word, it would be "irrelevant."  It had no flavor whatsoever.  It tasted like if you were to grill chicken with nothing but olive oil.  I agree with another reviewer who said that if the sauce were thicker and stuck to the meat, it would be better.  Perhaps if you were to marinate it overnight, it might impart some flavor, but as the recipe is written, it is bland.  Some ideas for improving it: marinating overnight, reducing the marinade, adding minced garlic, adding cajun spices, or adding brown sugar or molasses (to add a glaze)?

This was verrrrrrryyy flavorful and moist!  I substituted olive oil for butter due to dietary restrictions & I also marinated the chicken for a few hours.  My grill ended up being "out of order" today so I baked the chicken in the oven instead . . and it still came out wonderfully.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very good recipe.  I used chicken thighs with 12 thighs in the package since I had it on hand.  There was more than enough sauce and the chicken was very moist and flavorful.  This recipe could be versatile for almost any type of meat or poultry.

This was very tastey.  I cooked the chicken low and slow and it came out very moist and tender.
I had to substitute the steak seasoning for garlic salt and it tasted good.

Sorry, but not my best grilled chicken. The beer washed out the flavor of the seasonings. It is much better with just olive oil and seasonings. Maybe next time I will Marinate like some other reviewers, but this review is on the orginal recipe.
