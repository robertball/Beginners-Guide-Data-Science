This was much better than I thought it would be! I added a little more garlic (surprise surprise) and it really was very hummus-like. With some crackers, this is going to make great - healthy! - snacking over the weekend. Thanks!

This is a very good alternative to hummous.  Very easy to make.  I made it w/out the dill and it was fine without.  Very good as a spread on bread.

LOVE it!  Great spread on a tortilla with a little bit of salsa!  Makes for an awesome lunch or small dinner.  I was skeptical of this but it was such a great easy spread!

I wanted to like this but I just didn't.  The garlic was overpowering for some reason and I think I squirted in too much lemon juice...

I only made a couple of changes, I substituted low fat cream cheese for the cottage cheese because it was what I had, and adjusted a few spices.  Warmed up between two tortillas was exactly what I was looking for.  Yummy!

i'm not sure why others mentioned it, but b/c of the ingredients, this is nothing like hummus.  an okay little dip that was super easy to make.  i used fresh dill b/c i had it on hand & it complemented the cottage cheese well.  the over all texture was a bit pasty, requiring me to eat fresh tomatoes and cucumbers w/ it to give it more moisture.  it would be nice on a sandwich or a pita, but not alone w/ crackers.

We didn't care for this.  The texture is odd - very pasty.  There isn't much flavor to speak of.  Sorry - I wanted to like it, but this just isn't for us.

My husband and I found this dip to be nothing like hummus.  The texture was too pasty, and the flavors did not mix well.  Thanks for the recipe.  We are always looking for new things to try.

"Dill dip that hides healthy beans" would be a better description for recipe. I appreciate these nutritious ingredients but my drained & rinsed pintos got lost in the 1 full cup of cottage cheese, while that 1 teaspoon of dill overpowered all. I had no pasty problem like others and will take that as a compliment to my Ninja blender. ...Maybe use 1/2 cup cottage cheese and consider omitting or greatly decreasing dill to bring back the pintos and make this a bean spread as labeled.

For me, I liked the flavor... had a nice mild taste.  The part I didn't really like was the texture. It did have a pasty texture. I am going to play with this and maybe add some grated cheese or something to change that part.  I do think this is less noticeable when eaten as a sandwich spread rather than a dip

This is a great dip!  To me it had the color and consistency of onion dip so I think the next time I make it I may experiment with using onion powder and dried minced onions to see if I can get it to taste like onion dip, too.  I think a strong onion flavor would work well with both the pinto bean and cottage cheese components.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Ok this dip is good but I don't get how people would think it would be like hummus. It's not even close to a hummus recipe.

it was really great, i put it on toasted pita bread
but i probably wouldnt use so much dill next time, its a little overpowering. but otherwise it was great!
