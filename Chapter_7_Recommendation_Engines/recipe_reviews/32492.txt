I haven't had it but I had a thought on how to improve it at least: instead of adding all the ingredients to the cocktail shaker, add one jigger each lemon vodka and orange liquor, shake it with ice, strain to a martini glass and top with champagne... I can't imagine shaking the champagne would be a good idea either way...
that might make it a little less "strong" but hey if its just the taste that sucks then I'd say look for the pomegranate champagne cocktail: that was SO good

We did not care for this recipe.  We had friends over last night and were drinking champagne so I figured I would try this recipe.  What a waste of good champagne.  Way too strong.

I thought this was very good! I never had a fizzy martini before! I love the citrus, very refreshing! A great way to use up leftover champagne!
