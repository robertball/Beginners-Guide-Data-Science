My husband says this is the best chicken recipe ever! I did change it a bit. I pounded the chicken flat, and used goat cheese instead of brie. I have used brie also and I like both but I have some goat cheese in the house that I want to use up so I used that. You can cut the amount of brie in half and still have leftover cheese. I ground the pecans in the food process or until they are like bread  crumbs. That way they stick to the chicken better. And then I bake the chicken instead of frying. I bake it at 350 degrees for about 30-40 minutes. I use raspberry jam for the sauce mixed with chambord. I melt the jam on the stove and add the chambord. It is really good and saves time. This is my go to fancy chicken recipe.

Might be the odd ball here, but I felt disappointed with this. The flavors just weren't there. I did things a little differently, however not so much with the ingredients really, as with the cooking method. Generally I get a bit weary about not cooking chicken all the way through which was my fear based on the instruction for frying for 15 minutes then again for another 15 mintues which in my mind would burn the outside shell of nuts, but not cook the inside. So after frying for 15 mintues first, I then threw it in the oven for 20 instead. The chicken came out very juicy, but bland. The cheese could hardly be tasted and the watery taste of the chicken dispersed the rasberry flavor. I will try this again with just frying like it calls, but I will use more oil than is being called for, fry  in a small pan and maybe cover it or something.  Also, someone mentioned that they had issues having the pecans stick to the chicken.  This was my other reason for putting it in the oven where there would not be a necessity to turn it over many times, hence making the pecans fall off. However, I think there is a fix for this.  This would involve crushing the nuts to almost a powder before covering the chicken. (If you like the crunchy texture, you can add some non crushed pecans to the sauce instead.) I have figured out from other recipes that a good way to make things stick is to dredge the chicken in a thin coat of flour first, then dredge in the egg and last roll it in the outsid

My guests were impressed with this dinner entree. Top cut the fat, I used only half the Brie and baked rather than fried these. To get a crispy oven fried version, I simply sprayed them with butter flavored cooking spray (rather than using egg dip) prior to rolling them in GROUND toasted pecans. To cut carbs, I subd spoonful equal for the sugar in the berry sauce and added a touch of lemon juice. YUMMY! Thanks Rebecca.

This was very tasty and the presentation was impressive.  I will make this recipe again because it tasted and looked so good even though the prep was a little messy and I had a difficult time with the cheese mixture staying inside the chicken when I rolled it up.  To make this a little lighter I did make a few changes - I substituted 1/2 of the finely chopped pecans with seasoned breadcrumbs (put both in food processor to mix to desired consistency) and baked at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes instead of cooking in olive oil on stove top.

I used 1/2 lb. of brie, and I still had some mixture leftover.  Two cups of pecans is too much - most of them ended up on the bottom of the skillet turning black.  The raspberry sauce on top really made this recipe good, though.

We liked the taste of this alot - but make sure you crush the pecans good, they didn't stay on the chicken well, and make sure you wrap the chicken around the cheese well or it will leak out.

Made this with less cheese and less onions...pan fried for 15 minutes than in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  It was really great.  Dinner guests said they had to have recipe.

Interesting and fun flavors - a dish for those with a sense of adventure. Definitely use less cheese and green onion than the recipe calls for, or there will be a lot of it left over.

Great recipe!
I used half the brie, and chilled the chicken after the brie was applied for about 10 min, while I made the rasberry sauce.  I used Splenda in place of sugar and added about 1/4 cup of Chambord.
Next time I will grind the pecans more and bake the rolls, so I can do other things while they cook.

We didn't have pecans so used cashews instead. Tasted good...the brie wasn't super but may be personal preference. The raspberry sauce added lots of colour and flavour! Yum!

Excellent,  I added a leaf or two of spinach with the brie before rolling to add some color.  I would do that again.  I also made sure the pecans were crushed well added a bit of bread crumbs to the pecan mixture sprayed with a touch of butter and baked.  WOW this plated so nice and was incredible in taste.  I did not have any rasberries so I used strawberry preserve looking forward to trying the rasberry sauce.  This dish would be excellent with a mixed green salad, candied walnut or pecans, blue cheese, pear salad with a rasberry vinegarett.  I prepared the chicken the night before (pounding flat) so the rolling cheese and coating with pecans seemed mimimal in prep work.

I'm sorry but this just wasn't there for us. The onion/garlic mixture was bizarre with the berries, it was greasy and the cheese came out of the middle.
Will not make again.

I gave this five stars; it really was incredible.  My dinner guest & my husband absolutely loved it (so did I)!  I didn't have pecans so I used ground toasted walnuts.  Also, instead of making raspberry sauce from fresh berries I simply warmed some raspberry preserves in a saucepan and added a little extra water along with a spritz of lemon juice to thin it.  The end result was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

The raspberry sauce definitely makes the difference.  I used cream cheese.  Make sure the pecans are FINELY chopped bec/ they don't stick very well.  I used frozen raspberries, and added less sugar and almost no water.  Makes it thicker

This recipe was really good.  I followed the advice of several others and halved the amount of Brie. To make it lighter (again following someone's advice), instead of the egg wash, I just sprayed the tops of each chicken roll with a buttery flavored spray and then sprinkled the ground pecans over the top.  For the raspberry sauce, I used Splenda instead of sugar for a lighter version.  I baked it rather than frying and they came out beautifully.  I had no problem with leaking cheese, but I didn't actually roll mine, I just folded the chicken on all sides over the top and held it together with toothpicks.  Very yummy.

I used feta instead of brie and after frying until brown on both sides, I baked in the oven.  Very delicious!  Definitely crush the pecans until they are basically powder if you want them to stick well as a crust.

My husband now requests this on a regular basis. The Original recipe is good, but after a few trials I found that using Garlic and herb flavored Brie gives a better flavor than just the regular brie with onion and garlic added to it.

This turned out great. As someone else suggested, I baked the chicken at 350 for 30 minutes instead of frying and I used less than half the brie that the recipe called for, but I loved it and will definitely make it again. It was fairly easy to make, while at the same time being fancier in appearance and taste than your standard chicken recipe. The raspberry sauce was great and so simple. This one's a keeper.

Did not stick together as I would have liked, but the flavour was great!  Excellent recipe for "family meal", but I would not serve for a dinner party (only because they kinda fell apart).

This tasted good, it was a lot of work though.  I didn't read the reviews before I made it and wish I would have.  I would, as others suggest, cut the cheese in half.  Also, my husband suggested I butterfly the chicken next time instead of pounding flat as it didn't roll very well.  I had to use several toothpicks for each roll.  I also fried until golden brown and then baked in the oven.

This dish was excellent- I was unsure of the raspberry sauce at first, but when I tried it I couldn't believe how much it added to the dish! A delightful contrast of flavors- pecans at their best.

the flavor was great and I used the ingredients as listed with one exception to follow....but I did make some changes to the technique.1) the raspberry sauce:I simmered the berries/water/sugar in a pan then strained them. I don't understand why you put the berries in the blender then strain them...this will chop up the seeds and make them harder to strain. Cooking the berries brings out more of the juice/flavor and the seeds you want to strain are not all chopped up in little bits; 2)the filling: I made it as listed though my garlic cloves are sooo huge that in effect I probably doubled them. The brie: does not say if you are supposed to use the rind on or rind off...and that will make a big difference in the flavor. I ended up using the rind off. 3) the crust: 2 cups of pecans is very expensive and also hard to stick to the chicken. Then when you brown it some of that then falls off the chicken. I changed it to half nuts and half bread crumbs. It costs a lot less to make, stays on the chicken better and there is still plenty of nutty crunchy pecan flavor. And then I just put them in a 350 oven for 45 min instead of browning them and then finishing them in the oven. The nuts don't fall off that way.

I truly loved this reciped. Didn't really make much changes - did add a dash of nutmeg to the brie mixture (which I cut the amt in half that I made, as others recommended, and still threw a little bit away). Also didn't use the egg wash for the pecans - they stuck just fine to the chicken without it, but I baked the chicken instead of frying it (much better for you!!).  Made the raspberry sauce using splenda instead of sugar & it was divine, but again, much more than I needed. But then again, my husband & kids did't even use it - so it made a great topping for angel food cake. But both my 11yo girl & 4yo boy gobbled it up & my husband loved it.

I made this first without salt to taste and it was fine, but nothing special. However, I then put salt on the chicken and it was a night and day difference. With the salt this recipe is a keeper. Very good.

WOW this was good. Like a previous reviewer, I used raspberry jam and chambord as the sauce (My store didn't have raspberries today), but I don't think it suffered at all for it. I will definitely be making this again, although I will continue to experiment with different cheeses.
I can't wait to serve this for a dinner party!

This will take a lot longer than 30 min to prepare. the raspberry sauce is good. as for the chicken..Lets just say it's too much work for the tase of the final product.
