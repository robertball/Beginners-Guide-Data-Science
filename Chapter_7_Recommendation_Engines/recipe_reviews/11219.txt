I really liked this recipe. A definite keeper. They were tasty, crunchy on the outside, and VERY chewy on the inside.

This year I made these cookies first. When I asked the family what other cookies they wanted each of them said "There is no other cookie only THESE cookies" I had to make 4 batches before they would let me give any away.

Great cookie.  Crunchy and chewy together.  Next time I think I will add some chopped apricots, seems to hint of that flavour as they are now.  They do flatten out quite a bit and will look like a regular cookie after baking

I decided to make this recipe for my family and at first it came out all runny because I forgot to include wax paper. But I recooked them and they turned out great. My parents and my brother liked them, and they looked chewy but they were crunchy :3

I made some alterations. I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1/2 of a 16 oz bag of marsh mallows that  I cut into small pieces. I added spices like 1 teaspoon of ginger, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and I added 1 medium size bag of sliced almonds , and the whole 14oz bag of grated coconut. I put a heaping tablespoon of the mixture in muffin tins and baked them for 40 mins. at 250 degrees F, because coconut burns at high heat.

They're okay, not quite what I thought they would be.  Next time I think I'll make a cookie batter and then add the extra stuff so that they aren't so flat.
