This was really really good.  After reading reviews that it was a little thing, I used a combination of water and actual picante sauce, instead of just water.  Next time I will put some beans in the mix.

Great meal for a cold, rainy day.  I used leftover potatoes from another recipe called Amanda's Potatoes.  It had a hint of sweetness that really added to the recipe.  I would make this again.  Plus the kids liked it.

Enjoyed this easy to make recipe. Would definitely make again. Made it spicier by substituting chunky hot salsa for the diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Added 1 cube Knorr chicken boullion and 3 slices of bacon that were diced and sauteed with onion.

It was a nice and easy dish.  I cooked it exactly as listed but I did add black beans with about 30 minutes left to cook.  I served it with cornbread!

Very yummy!  Made this last night after a very long day at work and it was so easy!  I added black beans and substituted bacon for the sausage.  I also added homemade chunky picante sauce for the spice kick.  I ended up adding dried cilantro and cumin to the spice list to round out the flavors.  

I can't wait to make this again!  I may try it with shredded beef.
