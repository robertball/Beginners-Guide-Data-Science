This is always a favorite with my husband. I have made this many times, using a variety of vegetables each time. I use more cheese than is called for, and slightly less mayo (just enough to keep the mixture moist). I also use less dill, and sprinkle basil over the top before baking. I would suggest steaming the broccoli to "crisp tender", and lightly frying the onion and garlic. Otherwise, the vegetables do not cook through during baking, and the onion especially can be a bit strong. All in all, this is a fantastic recipe that lends itself to variety, and is easy to prepare.

This recipe was awesome! I made a boo-boo tho and didn't form the braid on the pan so I kinda screwed it up as I had to transfer it to the pan and it got a bit messed up in the process. 
I substitued some of the ingredients to what I had on hand. I used green pepper instead of red, Italian seasoning instead of dill weed and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. Everything else I kept the same including the almonds (which I couldnt seem taste by the way). I thought it was great & so did my hubby. I will be making this again! 
I knew how to make the braid from a previous recipe long ago so I thought I would draw a diagram (forgive my paintshop skills!) for those of you having problems. It can be found at:

The first time I made this the center dough was not cooked completely. Second time I made it I really streched it out and it turned out perfect. Just the right amount of ingredients for every bite! It looks so fancy when the top is golden brown, your guests will be impressed.

This is a favorite in our house - my boyfriend never can seem to get enough.  Instead of dried dill, I use 2TBSP of FRESH dill - this makes a big difference, I believe.  I also like to use PIZZA DOUGH instead of the rolls - those just never seemed appealing to me. I cook the chicken in a pan on the stove with a little extra virgin olive oil, the broccoli, the garlic, and the onion. I always add celery and carrot to this dish, and sometimes some green onion.  I also sprinkle sesame seeds on top before baking it.  This is an easy recipe that always yields excellent results.

I have been making this for years and so glad I found the recipe on here too!! A few changes that I do: steam broccoli before, I like to season and boil my chicken to cook it although we have grilled it before and it comes out just as yummy, use 1 red bell pepper and 1 green bell pepper, omit the onion, and we usually use the whole package of sliced/slivered almonds (they give the dish the best crunch)!!

Definitely my favorite recipe of all times!

Update: My husband and I make this at least once a month! We ALWAYS have trouble cooking this (the top/middle of the crescent rolls never get done as quickly as the sides do)...so we use some foil to cover the sides so that everything cooks evenly...it usually takes close to an hour (covered and uncovered to cook completely. We have tried cooking on a baking stone and also a cookie sheet...either works just fine. We use 1/2 teaspoon of dill and sharp cheddar cheese.  Love this!

My family loved this recipe.  I followed it exactly, except for the dill and the dough directons.  I reduced the amount to 1/2 tsp.  I like dill, but not love it!  And for the braid, I cut the strips AFTER I placed the chicen on the dough, not before, as directed in the recipe.  See my photo with the recipe too!

I made mine into a wreath using 1 package of Grands crescent rolls.  I felt the recipe called for Way too much dill.  I used only 1/2 teaspoon and was just right.  Next time I will slightly cook the broccoli first. I don't like it so crunchy.  This makes a beautiful looking dish to impress guests.

This was an excellent recipe. When making for a party, I make the filling a day ahead then just
put it together and bake. I have made this many times and haven't had a problem with doughiness.
Check your oven if you have a problem-it's probably too hot. P.S. I'm sick of reviewers pushing their overpriced Pampered Chef products.

Yum!  Make a couple changes: omitted the bell pepper (didn't have any) and cut the dill a little bit.  Also, cooked the chicken with the onions and garlic with some poultry seasoning, then added the broccoli (as another reviewer suggested) to let it cook a bit.  Didn't do the braid, but laid one can of rolls flat on baking sheet, added the chicken mixture on top, then topped with the other can of rolls (butter-flavored), cutting openings to let steam escape and pinching the two sheets of dough together.  Baked for 25 minutes.  Good, good meal!

They now sell solid sheets of crescent dough, so you don’t have to press the individual rolls together, makes it a lot easier to use. This is a Pampered Chef recipe and calls for 1 teaspoon of dill weed, not 2. Personally I don't use dill, don't care for the flavor. I also use parmesan cheese, not cheddar. I often use a Calzone filling, of onion, bell pepper and crumbled Italian sausage (cooked & well drained) mixed with pizza sauce and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese. Cubed ham, broccoli and Swiss cheese is also good. You can substitute just about any combination of cooked meat, vegetables and cheese, mixed with about a 1/2 cup mayonnaise, sour cream, or any type of sauce to moisten; even 1/2 cup of creamed soup (undiluted)) will work. Serve with a salad, makes a nice dinner, or cut into bite sized pieces as an appetizer. And don’t forget dessert, spread dough with sweetened cream cheese, top with a fruit filling, and drizzle baked and cooled braid with a simple powdered sugar glaze.

This recipe turned out great!  The dill weed and almonds give this a really great flavor.  I served it for dinner with wild rice soup...
I will definately be making this again!

Made just a few changes.  Sauteed the onion and red pepper until onion was almost soft, then added garlic and sauteed for 30 seconds.  Used frozen broccoli, thawed in hot water and then chopped.  Used 1 tsp of dried thyme instead of dill.  Used Pillsbury crescent 'sheets' instead of the rolls.  Each package of crescent dough will make one braid.  Laid roll out on counter, put half the filling down the center.  Used a knife to cut every 1" down the right and left sides (looks like fringe).  Fold down the top just a bit and then fold one piece of the fringe over the top, then fold a piece from the other side, slightly overlapping.  continue down the braid (see picture).

This is a great recipe. I rarely have any leftovers. I just made two of these for a pot luck and all I took home were empty trays – everyone went back for seconds! It has a great taste, the dill weed is unique and inspired, and the almonds give it just enough texture. I did do a few things that I feel amped up the recipe. I doubled the garlic. Also in prepping the ingredients I sautéed the onions, garlic and bell peppers in olive oil until the onions started to turn clear. I also cooked the broccoli for a minute in a ziplock steam bag (I luv those things). Then I made sure to mix all the dry ingredients well before adding the miracle whip (mayonnaise). It’s very simple to do the braid – don’t let it intimidate you. Definitely worth making!

This is a great recipe as is, but it's also a good "jumping off point"  Curry for dill is how we likie it.  Or, omit the herbs and broccoli and add dried cherries and celery.  Very good.  Great picnic sandwich.  Use ingredients for a reuben sandwich (my personal favorite-remember to add caraway seeds), or use pizza toppings, for example.  Bake it on the lowest shelf in your oven and the bottom will be baked perfectly.

TIP: Be sure the *broccoli* and red pepper are quite FINELY CHOPPED. This is key to cooking properly. This is a special family favorite, though I have now switched from using crescent rolls to using homemade bread dough (pizza, french, etc., at least one pound); I like this much better. I always double the filling when using bread dough. For seasoning, the original Pampered Chef recipe omits the onions, and instead of TWO teaspoons of dill (too strong) uses "dill dip mix" which I recreate with this: (SECRET RECIPE HERE!) 1 tsp. dill, 1 tsp. instant minced onion, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and a good squeeze of lemon (or 1/8 tsp. citric acid). WOW. Oh, one thing more, I think sprinkling the almonds ATOP the braid is SO classy and yummy.

i made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it. i doubled the garlic because i usually find recipes need more, but it was sort of overpowering, so unless you REALLY like garlic, i'd say stick with what the recipe suggests! i left out the red pepper and almond for personal preference, but otherwise followed the basic recipe and was impressed with how easy the braid came together - not nearly as complicated as you might think! this was something different, that i wouldn't want to eat regularly, but for a change of pace i really enjoyed this. thanks!

Extra filling makes a great cracker dip by itself!!  Our oven cooked this recipe in 12 minutes, so be careful not to overcook.

When I began making this I was a vegetarian and substituted potatoes for the chicken. I continue to love that version more. I cut up 2+ cups potato, boil it for 7 - 10 minutes in salted water, and then chill the potato (often in the freezer because I'm so anxious to eat the finished product) before mixing it in with everything else. I often add more salt and garlic than the recipes suggests, and I omit the onion. And, because I often serve these at potlucks, I just use the individual crescent rolls, fill them with the yummy mixture, and bake them according to the crescent directions without messing with the almonds and egg whites to make individual servings. This method requires that you chop the red pepper very finely so that it cooks quickly. Eveything else cbakes and melts well in the reduced time. Delicious! And, it is easy to reheat individual servings as you would like them.

So good! My husband likes to rank the recipes I make for dinner, and this was his new number one! FYI: Pillsbury now makes the crescent roll dough without the perforations, just for recipes like this one. I believe it's called Recipe Creations.

Wow..What a great appie.  The only change was to sautee the brocolli, pepper, and onion in oil for ten minutes prior to mixing with the other ingredients.  Simple easy and delicious.  People not only raved..but they thought I had bought it and just heated it up.  Now thats the best compliment you can get!

This is excellent! I've made it a couple of times and it's always devoured.  Keep in mind that you have to work quickly with the dough, it turns gooey after about five minutes.  I always flour my hands to work with it.  Also, it's very hard to move after you have gotten it ready for the oven, so assemble it on your baking pan.  Don't be alarmed by the color--it's delicious!

I really tried...it was so beautiful, BUT...I've made it twice. The first time, even though I checked it ten minutes early, it was burnt. The second time, I set timer EXTRA early. Looked beautiful, but lacked flavor. My kids are a bit picky, but even I and hubby were having trouble finishing our portion. Most ended in the can, sad but true. Thanks for recipe, but I could not make this work without TOTALLY rewriting it...

Good base recipe, easily adapted for variations. I made this, substituting feta and baby swiss for cheddar--sour cream for mayonnaise--no dill--no almonds--firmly packed roll fit into ONE pillsbury crescent roll package--changed baking time to 25 minutes at 350 degrees--served three adults easily. SEE picture included

Ive been making this for 8 yrs.  I got it at a "Pampered Chef" party.  I don't use chicken or any other meat and it still gets "rave" reviews.  I use the broccoli, red pepper, cheese, mayo, dill and a shake of garlic salt and do the braid with cresents.  I've always "eyeballed" the measurements actually using about half the amount of these per container of cresents.  Anytime I ask my family what they would like for dinner, this is the choice and it's a given for company because it is impressive looking as well as tasting.

This was great!  I had had it before at a bridal shower, but never got the recipe.  I made this for a Christmas party and everyone raved!  Even my mother who is an unbelievable cook asked for the recipe.  I didn't do the braid, I made it into a wreath by using a glass in the middle and putting the cresent rolls points out all around the glass to make a sun, then stuffed it with the filling and folded the points around it.  Doing it this way, left enough filling to make 2.  I will definetly make this again!

This recipe was a huge hit with company!  Since I'm not a dill weed fan, I was going to bypass using it.  Instead, I only added 1 tsp., and I'm glad I did.  It wouldn't have tasted as good without the dill.  Easy recipe to make substitutions to the filling (ham and cheese, vegetarian, etc).

This was really good.  Make sure before you add the broccoli that you take the stem chunks out.  The chopped florets taste great, but when you bite into a stem piece it still tastes OK, but not as good as the florets do.  Also, add extra shredded cheese - my boys really liked it.

This recipe works out every time I use it.  I leave out the peppers (we don't like them), almonds (allergy) and I make my own biscuit dough instead of the crescents (we don't eat canned dough).  I believe this is such a good recipe that even the changes to suit my family do not harm the overall great taste of this recipe.  SUPER!!

I love this and make it often. I never use dill since I never have it, and half the time I forget the almonds and never notice. I often change the broccoli to spinach because I usually have it on hand. If I can make a dish I'm will to serve for guests, it gets 5 stars for sure.
"...............loved this. added ranch dressing and a big spoon jalapeno relish

absolutely delicious!  followed the recipe as written except to reduce the dill to an 1/8th of a tsp, sub 1/2 the mayo for light sour cream, sub sliced almonds for the slivered and omitted the bell pepper as I didn't have any.  The cook time and temp worked for us after blanching the broccoli and sauteing the onion and chicken prior to mixing.  (We didn't find the onions overpowering at all :)  )I also had no problem with sticking - just greased the pan and then lightly sprinkled corn meal over that and then the crescent dough. To those who subbed cream of chix soup for the mayo and used thyme instead of the dill, and then rated it poorly you should really try it like this.  It's SO GOOD!

Very good! My two fairly picky teenagers even ate it! I didn't have enough mayo so I used half mayo and half sour cream and I added some sauted mushrooms. It turned out really good. I think this might be good with cream of chicken soup or cheddar cheese soup instead of the mayo. Really good recipe with lots of options to try.

I make this recipe whenever I have a party or have to bring a pot luck item.  Everyone loves it, raves over it, and asks for the recipe.  Although I am NOT good at the braiding - I make more of a loaf, it still looks spectacular.  I don't egg wash it - it isn't necessary.

For the holidays I have sprinkled the top with red and green bell peppers and have made a wreath shape.  I always double the recipe, because one isn't enough.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Beautiful and delicious. Used homemade wheat pizza dough for a healthier option. Boiled the chicken breasts in salt water, then diced them. Stir fried the veggies and chicken cubes in olive oil with some Italian seasoning. I only used 1/2 tsp dill. We ate it before I had a chance to take a photo. There will be a next time for sure. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Update: Made it a second time and again wonderful and easy. The almonds don´t add much for flavor but the occasional crunch is a nice feature; used previously frozen broccoli and squeezed the excess water out; only put half the amount of dill; had sliced cheddar on hand, so I just cut them up into small pieces. Overall, a very flexible meal to put together since you can vary the meat, veggies and type of cheese.

This is something I've been making for years!  At Christmas time I shape the whole thing into a wreath and bake it on a pizza pan.  I don't care for the dill, and use thyme with the chicken.  As another viewer has already noted, you can use almost any combination of meat and veggies -- parmesan is really tasty with the broccoli.  The braided 'wreath' is particularly festive for family gatherings.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used onion flakes instead of onion, and green peppers. I used frozen broccoli thawed in the microwave and it worked well. I also halved the recipe for just my husband and I, and it made plenty.  I will make this again, but without the almonds. I am an almond lover but I thought it just had too many textures going on.

As I was prepping this, I was expecting to LOVE it, as I really enjoy everything it's made from.  Not so much.  Mr. LTH really enjoyed it, but I was not as big of a fan.  I can't put a finger on why, though.  The only alterations I made were to increase the amount of broccoli and use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Sadly, I was also out of red pepper, so that was left out.  I used my largest baking sheet and couldn't fit 2 rolls of crescent dough, so I simply made it as 2 braids.  I plan to take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow to see if maybe I'll like it better cold.  Thanks for a really neat recipe!

This was delicious.  I've made it a couple of times and have found that red onion tastes better than regular white onion.  If you have to use a regular onion, it's better to saute it first so it doesn't taste so raw.  I also like to use a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese, and I use Pillsbury pizza dough instead of crescent rolls.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good! I made it for my family and we all loved it. The braiding was easy. There is some chopping involved , but as long as you've got an electric chopper its a snap. The Dillweed really peps it up!

Wonderfully quick and easy recipe that tastes great! 

I modified the recipe to make 2 smaller braids, one for me and one for my vegetarian wife (just ommited the chicken on her braid and added more veggies). 

We both loved it and are having the leftovers for lunch!

Next time, I would probably cut back on the dill a bit.

This one is a keeper!

If the outside of your braid is golden brown and the inside is still uncooked, simply lower the oven temperature. I made this last night, with the following notes: I put a cup of fresh broccoli florets into a pyrex measuring cup, and nuked it for 1 minute, perfect for this recipe. Due to dietary limitations, I did not use onion, or almonds, and instead of dill weed (not fond of the taste), I used 1 tsp Italian seasonings. I mixed the mayo, 2c thawed rotisserie chicken I had frozen last month, seasoned salt, and Italian seasonings. After creating the braid, I brushed with a beaten egg (not just the whites) and the end result was a delicious, beautiful golden brown, shiny pastry. I baked at 350 for 26 minutes.

Just okay.  I would omit the almonds next time.  My husband prepared this and added more garlic than what was called for...I would go with just the amount specified.

This recipe turned out incredible! The pastry was golden brown and flaky, the filling was flavorful and warm, the vegetables were tender, and it was a huge hit with my family! I'll definitely be making this again!

Pretty good.  I used only one container of rolls and it worked out fine for the 3 of us.

Great family friendly dish (I think- my kids will be trying it tomorrow!). I made them into individual pockets instead of the braid for easy freezing/reheating & portioning for my 2 yr olds. There was too much filling for 1 can of crescent rolls so I baked the rest in a glass dish & ate it myself on crackers. I love that I have all the ingredients in my pantry/freezer pretty much all the time. To make my life easier I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  I didn't have bell pepper on hand but would use it next time. I did steam the broccoli ahead of time mostly b/c of the kids, they're more likely to eat it if it has a less distinct texture.

Yum! I would definitely saute the onion and peppers next time. But other than that, will leave everything the same.

I followed the recipe exact except I used 2 cups of broccoli, 1 tsp of dill, and used a whole red pepper. I saute the veggies in a pan with Pam for a few minutes. I used two cans but also made two rolls. Instead of a braid I twisted each piece together to form a knot. I felt that gave it a more rustic look. Brought one roll for a potluck at work and everyone loved it. The other was for me and my fiance for dinner. This was very tasty!!! Would not change anything else.

Only used one sheet of crescent roll dough and it was plenty (just needed to be stretched out). Baked at 350 for 30 min. and it was golden brown and not doughy at all. A very versatile recipe that can be used with many combinations of protiens, veggies, herbs, and sauces.

I added chicken powder seasoning to the meat.  I chopped the broccoli superfine so I didn't have to "blanche" it beforehand.  I added Italian seasonings and skipped the dill as we don't like dill.   I used mozzarella instead of cheddar.  I added way more bell peppers and used all 3 colours.  I also added mushrooms.  My last step was to sprinkle slivered almonds on the top before baking which gave it an extra special touch.  It makes an easy yet attractive dish to take to dinners.   Make the mixture the night before and put it together about an hour before stepping out of the house.  It will still be warm by the time it serves on the table.  If there are parts that look they are browning too darkly, cover those parts with foil.  I did not cross my braids but just pinched the two sides together and twisted a knot at the top. Do your work on kitchen paper so it's easier to transfer to the baking tray.  Slide your kitchen paper with your braid onto your baking tray. I turned it into a wreath shape to make it look more festive.

Thank you!! This has been added to our "regular" dinner list. This is a delicious recipe. I probably would even give it 5 stars for taste, however, I thought the directions could have been a bit more clear, especially in regards to the braiding, but practice does make perfect, as my second go around it turned out much nicer looking. 
The second time I added mushrooms to the mixture, and omitted the almonds. I also used puff pastry sheets instead of crescent dough, which I found worked MUCH better. Next time I will even attempt to make my own dough.

My fiance LOVED this. I cooked the chicken a little differently: marinated in a1 sauce, garlic, red pepper flakes, seasoning salt and a tiny bit of oil--cooked it in a pan. Then I made the mix as directed [though i forgot the onions] and added a little more mayo and cheese to make sure it stayed nice and moist. it came out delicious and I am making it again tomorrow on special request!

This was good!  I cut back on the dill. I think next time I will try a different spice.  I sauted all the veggies before putting them in an definitely used less mayo.  Oh, no almonds in the house and colby jack cheese, though I think Cheddar would have been better.

This was delicious, everyone loved it, even the kids!  I sprinkled some garlic powder on the top of the braid after the egg white, otherwise followed rec. exactly.  The braid was easier than I thought, although mine wasn't as pretty as the picture! Quick, easy and delicious!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. I cooked it till golden brown and even a little longer and i still got some doughy parts in the middle. The flavor was pretty good. I like dill, but I would probably use a little less dill next time.  My husband wasn't a big fan, he said it felt like he was eating an appetizer not a meal.  So I kept the leftovers for myself!

This is so easy and has such flavor. I did not have a red bell pepper so I used pimento and it worked out great. Also did not use the almonds. People were looking for more, will have to make extra next time.

This is out of the Pampered Chef Cookbook. We love making this! I substitute mayo (None of my family is a mayo fan) for stir frying everything in Olive oil, then braiding and baking. Still just as good!

Definately one of my favorites!  I substitute asparagus for the broccoli, wonderful taste!  Also, Pillbury now has crescent roll dough already cut into strips (vice triangles), another great time saver!  Great recipe for family dinners or entertaining

This is an impressive looking dish, but it's much easier than it looks!  It tastes great, too.  My bunco group loved it.  I'm going to try it with different kinds of filling.  What a great idea!

Just made this and we loved it.  My husband says this one is a keeper! I followed the directions exactly, baking time was right on at 25 minutes, It was a beautiful golden brown perfectly done on the inside. I would not change a thing. Thanks to the reviewer that gave the paintshop instructions on how to do the braiding...otherwise i might have made a mess of it! Beautiful presentation.

This was such a delicious dish! I did add some cauliflower, extra garlic and used red onions instead of white to give it extra color and chopped the vegetables in the food processor. I also omitted the almonds and sprinkled some flour on the pan before rolling out the dough. I will definately make this again.

This was just awesome!  Fun and easy to make, looks beautiful, and tastes so yummy!  I steamed the chopped broccoli just a couple minutes.  I sauteed the chopped raw chicken with the garlic and onion.  I used less mayo (1/4 cup) and less dill (1 tsp), which was the RIGHT thing to do.  I about doubled the cheese, using 1/2 sharp cheddar, 1/4 mild cheddar and 1/4 Italian Mix.  (Sharp was the way to go in my book).  Author made it unclear, but you put the second sheet of dough ON TOP of the first.  Really flatten out the dough, to make it bigger (and thinner).  *Put the chicken mix on before cutting, down the center about 3 inches wide.  **Work quickly with the dough!  The warmer it gets, the harder to work with, specially when braiding. I put almond slices on top to decorate.  Baked up beautifully and tasted sublime!

Why have I just now discovered this? It's easy to make, looks great, tastes wonderful. How can you go wrong? I had a rotisserie chicken and a couple of cans of crescent rolls on hand and this was a delicious way to use them! The only thing I did was use roasted red pepper and I left out the almonds. Yum! I want to make this for my in-laws when they come to visit.

This is a favorite recipe of mine. I originally got it from a Pampered Chef shower. 

I never use the onion, and have substituted garlic powder at times for the fresh garlic. Instead of making it into a braid, over the years I've taken to making a "wreath" with the crescent rolls.  I make a 5 inch diameter circle with the crescent triangles, with the long ends pointing outwards, top with the filing, and then fold the crescents over back towards the center. 

I've found that by making this in a wreath style, and using a pizza stone, the "wreath" thoroughly bakes in about 30 minutes at 350 degrees.

I loved this recipe and just had a couple changes which I think made it excellent.  I marinated & sauteed the chicken with garlic, olive oil and garlic salt.  In the same pan, I briefly sauteed the garlic, broccoli, onion and pepper.  I think this is essential otherwise your veggies will be too crisp. I also used 1/4 sour cream and 1/4 of fat free plain yogurt as I ran out of mayo.  Lastly, I sprinkled garlic salt & parsley over the braid after I brushed with egg white.  This makes for a lovely presentation and adds delicious flavor.

This was very good and I will definitely be making this again, possibly even for a dinner party (will have to braid neatly though).  I used puff pastry as that is what I had and it needed about 40mins to cook properly, which was enough time for the broccoli, pepper and onion to cook through.  For those who are worried about the mayo (as I was) - you can't taste it, you can just taste a tang and it is there to keep things moist and yummy. It seems that I forgot to use the dill and I won't try it cos I like it so much the way it is.  Such an easy way to get the extra veggies in!

This was fantastic.  I used green pepper instead of red, a little more onion, chicken, garlic and cheese then the recipe called for  and no almonds.  I also did saute the pepper, onion, garlic, steamed broccoli together and then added the rest right in the pan.  I didn't have the dough on hand so I made it from the recipe on this site "golden crescent rolls".  I used only half the dough (froze the other half) and rolled it out to about 10x15.  I put this on the table for dinner, went to put the baby to sleep and came back to 1/2 serving left - my husband and three year old ate it up!!

I love this recipe! I have tried it exactly the way the recipe called for and I love it. But now I make it with only about 1/4 cup of mayo and it is just as good, not quite so rich!

Great recipe, although I should have read more of the reviews before I prepared it. Next time I will definitely cook the onions and broccoli before hand as it does not cook much during baking which caused the onions to be over-powering.  I will also cut down on the mayo as it was a bit rich.  Other than that, though, it was delish!

This recipe was delicious and simple to fix.  However, the next time I make it, I plan to prepare it as a "pot pie" using a deep dish pan but all the same ingredients.

This had a nice flavor. Keep the dill at the recommended level. Used frozen broccoli and chopped onion but didn't defrost. No problems with that method. Way too much filling for two packages of crescent rolls but I made it work. If I make this again, I will probably keep the dough intact, stuff it and once it is sealed, come back and cut small decorative slits on the top one inch apart. You could also take an extra roll of dough and use a cookie cutter to put decorative shapes on top, or cut out your own like leaves etc for a fall dinner. Sweetness from the dough bothered me a tad but don't know what you could do about it. Used ready cooked chicken. Husband liked the flavor but I don't think he will ask me for this one again. One kid thought it was just another version of chicken pot pie -- and didn't care for it; one didn't try.

I have made this countless times and just now am able to review it. This recipe is wonderful and so easy to make. Even vegetable fussy kids loved this. I've used defrosted frozen broccoli in place of fresk with just as good results.

This recipe is one of the best to make.  I have seen the other reviews regarding the "doughy" center and to bake longer.  The trick to this recipe is that it is actually a Pampered Chef recipe and it works great on The Pampered Chef stoneware, the dough is flaky and golden brown.  If you aren't familiar with Pampered Chef, you should be, they have great products.

I made this to go along with our soup last night...not a hit with my family. Due to the doughy complaints, I cooked it for almost 30 min.  It came out looking very "brown" but "pretty." My girlfriend who stopped by to pick me up was very impressed by its appearance. However, it did not taste as good as it looked. First, there were STILL doughy parts (esspecially in the middle). Second, the onions were overwhelming (and that's saying something cuz I love my onions). IF I made this again, I would reduce the amt on onions...or perhaps saute them with the broccoli to make them both a little softer. Second, I might take another reviewers advice who made this into 2 smaller braids instead of 1 large one...which might eliminate the "doughyness." Great idea though...if you can get it to work right.

Great for impressing guests, and amazinly easy. Pretty much everyone will love this and ask for the recipe....It is amazingly easy, yet looks like it came from an expensive gourmet shop or something.  Can also use left-over turkey for this recipe, perfect way to use Thanksgiving left-overs.

This is very popular at our house-- definitely my husband's favorite!  I make it at least 
once a month and we eat it as a main dish, usually with a salad.  I have altered the 
seasonings a bit depending on what was on the chicken.  For example, I once had 
leftover grilled curried chicken breast, so when I made the braid I left out the dill and 
added about a teaspoon of curry to the filling... it was great!  I'm sure you can get 
even more creative with seasonings, but I stick pretty closely to this recipe.  The prep 
can be a bit involved, but once you get the hang of the "braiding" it's a snap.  Definitely 
try this one-- it's delicious, and makes an impressive meal to serve to company because 
it's so pretty

I have made this Pampered Chef recipe on many occassions.  Always good.  One option for a kid friendly version is to fill the braid with a mixture of mixed veggies, chopped cooked chicken, cream chicken soup, shredded cheddar cheese.

My family loved this!!  I used ranch dressing instead of the mayo/dill, a bag of frozen broccoli and added bacon, it was delicious.  I cooked the bacon and then sauteed onions and little minced garlic in the bacon grease, threw everything in to the pan to warm it up a bit and filled the roll.  I did have a lot of trouble using the crescent rolls so my braid was not nearly as pretty as I had hoped, I will definitely look for the crescent sheets people had mentioned for next time.

This was good. I made a few changes, following some of the reviews. I'm sensitive to raw onion, so I sauteed it in a bit of olive oil along with the garlic. I used a small amount of chopped roasted red pepper. I used less than a tsp of dill. I used low-fat mayo and grilled chicken. I also used a colby jack mix of cheese. It was yummy! I think I had more broccoli than it called for, but I liked it that way. I slightly steamed the broccoli and let it cool first before putting it in the mix .

Great easy to make recipe. I cooked the chicken and veggies before making the mix and followed the rest of the instructions . One tip of advise is to cook the braid at 350 degrees for 50 minutes to a complete hour. I had no problems with the dough not cooking properly and it was not burnt. The dish was filling and yummy.

This is delicious! My husband and I loved it, and I will definitely be making it again. Wonderful recipe!   I used baconnaise (bacon-flavored mayo) instead of mayo because it's all I had on hand, but that added a little nice bacon-y flavor that went well with the other ingredients.

I follow the recipe almost exactly with the exceptions: I saute the onion and bell pepper in olive oil before adding to the rest of the mixture, I boil the broccoli until soft, I cut the dough strips after I have placed the filling down the center of the dough and I toast the almonds before adding to the mixture. Sometimes I don't have almonds so I have to substitute a different nut and that works out fine. Walnuts taste really good in place of the almonds. I also use a whole egg for the egg wash. I use parchment paper under this while it bakes so it doesn't burn and stick to the pan because I've had problems with this braid burning on the bottom (and sticking to the baking sheet) and ending up doughy in the middle. Overall a great, quick and tasty recipe my family loves.

This is probably THE BEST recipe I've found on AR.  I did change it based on personal preferences and what I had on hand. (That's another reason this recipe is PERFECT - so many delicious combos can be made from this!!)  I made the following changes: I used a whole onion, a whole bell pepper and some sliced baby bella mushrooms in addition to the broccoli and chicken.  I sauteed the vegetables along with the chicken.  I used Montreal chicken seasoning and a Pizza/Pasta seasoning combo in the chicken and veggies while sauteeing.  I used Ranch dressing in place of the mayo.  I only used enough to make the filling stick together.  I used Colby Jack cheese.  I skipped the egg wash on the top.  Instead, I brushed it with butter, sprinkled it with cracked black pepper and a liberal dusting of grated parmesan cheese and parsley.  Some reviewers complained of a soggy bottom with the recipe as stated so I baked it for 28 minutes, then covered it with tin foil and baked an additional 8 minutes.  I removed it from the oven and allowed it to cool for 10 minutes before slicing.  My husband and son LOVED it.  This will DEFINITELY be put into the regular meal rotation!

I thought this was really easy to make & tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used breaded chicken added crispy bacon to the mixture.  Hubby said he could've done without the chicken & add more bacon.

Love this recipe it's delicious! :) Tonight was my third time making this and it takes so good everyone loves it. I do some things a bit differently. First off for the chicken I buy a whole rotisserie chicken it has so much more flavor. Then I omit the red pepper and almonds. Add fresh dill instead of dried. I chop everything up and then add some butter to a skillet to start sauteeing everything starting with onions for a bit then adding the chicken and lastly the broccoli. After a bit all of this over medium heat and when after adding the broccoli putting a lid on for a bit for the broccoli to soften a bit. Then adding spices, garlic, dill weed, cheese, and mayo and mixing everything together and the rest as written. Amazing recipe loved it so much!! :)

Cooked it twice and loved it both times. I didn't put the bell pepper, other than that followed the recipe exactly. It tastes great and it looks very cool. Great for a party

Great tasting recipe. I made a couple of changes, I didn't cut the crescent rolls until after I spread the filling on. Instead of mayo I used Ranch dressing and omitted the cheese, (lactose intolerant) came out fabulous, hubby is always askiing for it.

This was delicious and I highly recommend it, however I could only give four stars as I feel if you followed the directions as written it wouldn't be quite as delicious.  The only change I made was that I sauteed the broccoli, onions, garlic and pepper before adding it to the remaining ingredients.  Without pre-cooking them I think you would have  crunchy raw veggies.  Otherwise, this is an awesome recipe that looks like you put a lot of effort into even though it's relatively easy.

This is one of my BEST ever recipes.
I just made few additions and modifications. I added more veggies (carrot and corn) and a pinch of Italian seasoning for enhanced flavor. I also used 3/4 cup mayonnaise + 1/4 cup Caesar salad dressing. The result was AMAZING!

This recipe is melt in your mouth awesome and so easy to prepare.  I had some leftover rotisserie chicken that I chopped, which saved even more time...but was the only change I made.  No need to prep any of the veggies in a pan ahead of time - I just threw it all together, baked as directed, and it came out perfectly cooked (through) and the veggies were soft, hot, and delicious!  This is a kitchen keeper - great brunch, lunch, dinner, or midnight snack!

I used reduced fat mayo and celery seed because I didn't have dill. It was probably the celery seed's fault but I just didn't enjoy the flavor. I like the concept though and will definitely try again!

Excellent!!  I made this for lunch today and everyone loved it!  I've never made anything like this before, so I didn't deviate from the recipe too much except for only using 1/2 tsp of dill, which I mixed in the mayo.  The 1/2 tsp of dill was perfect.  I still tasted it, but it wasn't strong or overpowering.  I also sautéd the chicken, onion, garlic and red pepper all together in olive oil then mixed everything together.  I also cooked my fresh broccoli beforehand as well and ended up using more than 1 cup of it.  Really yummy.  I will be making this often!

We really liked this.  It made a nice, easy supper with ingredients I happened to have on hand.  I didn't have any almonds, so I used toasted pumpkin seeds.  I didn't have dill weed, so I used fresh tarragon from my garden. Other than that, I didn't change anything. The broccoli could have been done a little more to suit me (and I chopped it quite small), but I liked it anyway.

This has become one of our go-to recipes. My picky 19 month old even loves it, and it's a great way for me to get her to eat the broccoli and red peppers I put in it. My husband and I both really like this and it will be around for a long time to come.

I really like this recipe, although I reduced the dill a bit after the first time (not my favorite herb).  I was skeptical about the nuts, but it gives it a really nice crunch!  A great way to use some leftover chicken & broccoli.  I buy the sheets of crescent dough which is easier than the triangles.

I have made this 3+ times now and it is absolutely fantastic.  And SO EASY.
The first time I made it I misread the recipe and only used one package of crescent rolls (and the full amount of "stuffing" ingredients).  Somehow, amazingly, it all fit so I've made it with only one package of crescent rolls since.  You just have to stretch the dough out a bit more.

Used WW pizza dough and omitted the almonds.  The dill was unexpected but worked - I did halve the amount.  Sauteed the onion, pepper and garlic.  Added mushrooms too because they were on sale.  Put the filling on the dough first and then cut the strips as suggested and it worked perfectly.  Presentation was outstanding.

3 - 4 stars. Taste 4, recipe 2-3. The instructions for braiding the dough were not very clear, and consequently mine did not turn out all beautiful and pretty. I'll really have to work with this a few more times to figure out a way I can make the braid, because these instructions are not helpful!

This recipe is really great!  It is super easy and results in a delicious, beautiful main dish.  It looks really impressive but is so easy to make.  I made it with a llittle more broccoli and used green onions instead of regular ones just because I like them better.  The bread on the outside was perfectly done at 28 minutes,  golden brown all over and flaky. I think next time I will add fresh spinach to it.  I think lots of different veggies could be used for variety.  Very scrumpious!

I did not care for this at all.  It ended up kind of mushy and the flavor of the crescent roll was overpowering.  It looked all right, but I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites.

This recipe was fantastic! I know some people complain about how others change the recipe, but perhaps they don't have loved ones with allergies or picky tasters? Or sometimes our equipment just runs differently! I followed the other reviewers in that I used cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup milk instead of mayo, used red and green peppers and onions, and sauted them first, and used ground beef. I ALSO baked it at 200 degrees for 30 minutes and 325 for 10 minutes- and it baked PERFECT (so kudos to whomever mentioned that). I messed up the dough a bit in that I didn't think it could possibly fit on one pan (I think it is supposed to overlap on the pan until you fold it) so I made two on two baking pans at the same time. It was a delicious meal that pleased both my boyfriend and I-  I very rarely get seconds because I try to control portions- but I had to eat more!

I have made this before as written but today I was out of chicken.  So I made it with ground beef, added more onion (increased it to 1/2 cup sweet onion), increased it to 2 cloves garlic, left out the pepper (none on hand) and almonds (allergies).  It turned out excellent.  I think I might even like it better with beef than chicken.

Amazing and the great thing about this recipe is that you can try different ingredients. I made this twice, the first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was great but he second time I used the same main ingredients but instead of the mayo dressing I mixed together one can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/3 cup of white whine and 1/2 cup of milk, mixed with the chicken, peppers, broccoli, onions and almonds. It was even better. Cant get enough of it.

Delicious and simple recipe.  Was a hit with my guests!  Make sure to knead the dough together before trying to use it- otherwise, it'll break all apart!

The family all enjoyed this dish and I appreciated how easy it all came together.  I did take another reviewers comments and used ranch dressing in-replace of the mayo.  I also added mushrooms.  Presentation was terrific and will most likely use this for when we company.  Next time I will try adding other veggies also - asparagus, zuchinni and possibly even corn.   Thanks for sharing this recipe, it was a thumbs up at our dining table :)

I had a real hard time making this look "pretty".  I guess the more you make it, the better you get at the presentation.  If any one has tips / pics of how to lay the dough out and do the braiding, I would appreciate you posting it. Overall, this tastes good. We felt like it needed some kind of "kick" in the chicken mixture, so will play around with different spices to liven it up.  I doubled the mayo, because it just looked too dry when I was mixing it all up.

This was so yummy!  I left out the dill weed because I didn't have any, but it was fine.  Very easy to make.  This will definitely make a return to my dinner table.

5 star dish!!  My family wolfed it down!  I followed the reciped exactly with only 1 change.  I only used 1/2t dill just like some of the other reviews said and it was perfect!  I baked in oven for about 30-31 minutes and the dough was perfectly done.  VERY GOOD!!!

This recipe was delicious! I didn't use the red pepper or dill weed, instead I added mushrooms and used a veggie seasoning and sprinkled extra almonds on top. One of our new favorites! I will definitely use this when entertaining too, it's beautiful. It's all the best foods wrapped up in a crispy croissant.

I really liked the idea of making this dish out of crescent rolls - so that's what we had for lunch today. My mom and I thought the dill was a little too much - so maybe I'll reduce it or don't put any dill in there next time. My grandma thought it was excellent!  Although it tasted very good - I might try it again with some fat reduced cream cheese instead of the mayonnaise - I think it was a little too much fat for my taste.  I really think this is a great recipe - so I hope you guys give it a try!  I definetely will make this again - just putting my own twist to it :) But thanks again for the idea!a

I actually made this vegetarian for my son. Steamed 1 1/2 cups fresh broccoli until tender crisp and chopped small.  Sauteed red bell pepper, garlic and onion in 1 tsp. butter in small frying pan.  Decreased dill weed to 1 tsp. - perfect.  Increased almonds to 3 tablespoons.   All else according to original recipe.   Beautiiful and delicious!  Added to my recipe box for future.  Goes well with traditional salad and corn on the cob.

As suggested by other reviewers, I also sauteed the onions, pepper and garlic ahead of time as well as steamed the broccoli.    I also used smart balance mayo to help make the recipe moderately healthier

Very fast and easy! I just used leftover chicken, minus the red bell peppers and nuts and my husband loved it! Pretty sure you can just use whatever you have on hand!

I stuck pretty close to the recipe. I wasn't sure if I would like the almonds in there so put in less than the recipe called for. They actually added a nice mild crunch so I will use them next time. I didn't braid it, I just folded the dough over the top then flipped it over (and cut a couple vent holes) and it worked perfectly. I was afraid it might fall apart when serving, but it all held together very nicely! I will be making this again- my bf loved it!

I've been making this recipe for years now and my husband begs for it.  If you make sure to steam/saute the veggies first, this recipe is wonderful as is - no modifications are necessary in my opinion.    Having made it so many times, though, I can tell you that it is a pretty versatile recipe - don't be too afraid to tweak it to ingredients you happen to have around.   For instance, I don't usually have a red bell pepper or almonds around, so I just increase the amount of broccoli by 1/2 cup.  The change doesn't affect the outcome at all.  I also will often make this with a bread dough recipe instead of crescent rolls (which are more expensive.)  When we lived overseas and cheese was hard to find I made it with velveeta.    Great recipe!

Ok, so first of all, i've been using this recipe for about 10 years. However, to my knowledge it was created by Pampered Chef. Second, I only rated this version with 4 stars because making it this way doesn't come out quite as well. I make mine to the T by the Pampered Chef version. I use my chopper on both the chicken and the broccoli so that it's chopped pretty small. This fixes the issue everyone seems to have of the broccoli not cooking. I also use the P.C. dill mix as it's got the dill, garlic and onion in there. Other than that, this version is pretty close to that one. The only way I change the way I make it is to use the reduced fat crescent rolls.

Overall, it was great.  I halved the recipe because I only had one container of crescent rolls on hand, but I used half a head of garlic instead of a half clove.  Oops. (But it came out wonderfully!) Otherwise, I used green bell peppers instead of red b/c that's what I had, no dill- just seasoned w/ italian seasoning and paprika, and no almonds- none on hand.  Also, it didn't need the egg white wash.  It turned out perfectly!  I would upload a picture, but there isn't any left... and I have an extremely picky family!  Word to the wise: the portion recommended is about twice what I would say is reasonable and we love to eat!

Fantastic! I loved it and my husband did as well. I didn't make too many changes. I cut the recipe in half (only using 1 tube of crescent rolls and half the other ingredients) because I was only cooking for me and my husband. I also used mushrooms instead of the peppers. And I used less onion because I just wanted the hint of flavor.  Because the recipe was cut in half, it only had to cook for about 20 minutes. I also cooked it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper because I always manage to over-cook crescent rolls and then it sticks to the pan. I am always looking for ways to cook chicken differently, and this was fantastic! Definitely a keeper!!! Nice flavour (love the dill!)


Update August 10, 2010: This is still one of my husband's favourite recipes! Whenever I make something from this website and ask him to rate it, he always compares it to this recipe... "Its good... but not as good as that broccoli braid recipe!" :)

Beautiful, tasty, healthy and such fun to make!  I had a loaf of frozen bread dough on hand, so I thawed it and used it for the crescent rolls.  Instructions were clear for braiding.  I followed other reviewers and used 1 teaspoon dill (fine) and less onion.  Also I sauted the onion and vegetables before mixing with the chicken.  I used a mixture of mayo and sour cream.  The almonds added a nice crunch if you like them.  I'll definitely make this again, possibly for company, and I'll feel free to add other vegetables or other cheeses.  Outstanding recipe that allows the cook room for creativity!  Enjoy!

Don't leave out the dill but you can sure omit the onions as it has enough flavor with out it. I never do the egg wash and leave out the almonds too, you won't miss them.  Also, Miracle Whip is a better choice than mayo in this IMHO.

A M A Z I N G!!!  Dish came out just as beautiful as the picture here.  I only adjusted adding more broccoli and left out peppers.  I think it would be great with a combination of meats and/or veggies.  I already have been passing along the recipe.  It's so pretty I'm definitely bringing it to the next pot luck.

Healthier (in my opinion) option: I didn't think I'd like the broccoli, so I used frozen spinach. Omitted bell pepper (out) and mayo (didn't need it). Basically, I cooked the chicken, then added the spinach, onions, and garlic near the end of cooking to warm. I took the pan off the heat, mixed in almonds and cheese (used about half of recipe's amount), and continued on with step 3. I didn't use any egg whites, and my crust came out fine.

This remindes me of a similar braided chicken & broccoli dish in my Pampered Chef cookbook that I never tried... I made this a while ago, but just found my notes and decided to give it a review.  Here goes.  I made a few changes to suit my tastes. including subbing deli chicken (purchased a chunk of oven-roasted chicken and cubed it myself) for the cooked chicken and sprinkling a few slivered almonds on top of the braided dough.  Served with fresh fruit kebobs and yogurt dip.  Good recipe, especially for a light lunch or supper.  Thanks!

Very good, but I think I will only use 1 tsp. dill next time. My 12 year old said, "mom, this kinda tastes like pickles." Not the review I was shooting for...Anyway, very good and the almonds were amazing. Even better the next day!

This recipe was wonderful! I steamed the broccoli and sauteed the onion and garlic first. I made two and for the second one I added buffalo wing sauce and used blue cheese. Wonderful flavor!

It's yummy and very pretty, but very fattening! I substituted light cream cheese for some of the mayo. You can put virtually anything in it that you like. I made one with spinach and portobello mushrooms that turned out well.

Pretty darn good! The missing star is because the filling is a little flat as written. I used garlic salt and some lemon pepper to give it a little more kick. (Remember the croissants are fairly rich all by themselves so taste the filling before hand and add what sounds good to you.) I too was intimidated by daunting “braid” directions but it’s really a lot easier than it sounds. Just make one large rectangle from the dough, then cut 1" strips about 1/3 of the way into the "long" sides, leaving an intact section down the middle. Add the filling and then fold the fringes over the top. I promise I have no artistic talent and mine looked great. Thanks!

Made this for my holiday party last night and everyone raved, even though I thought it was a little overdone at 28+ minutes.  Next time I'll check it at 25 minutes.  This recipe is so simple and so delicious--tasty chicken and broccoli combine with the flaky goodness of crescent roll dough.  Everyone asked for the recipe and I'll definitely be making it again.

I did not have any dill weed, but it was wonderful without it.  My whole family loved it, including my 20 month old daughter.  I did saute the vegetables before adding them to the chicken mixture.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Very pretty presentation! I altered the recipe based on prior reviews and personal tastes. I used 3 cups of cubed chicken which I sauted in a skillet with cajun seasonings, 2 c cheddar cheese (we like cheese!), 2 c of broccoli and a tad more mayonaise to compensate for the increase in other ingredients. I sauted all of the veggies and garlic together until soft. I then mixed all of the ingredients together and put in the refrigerator over night. The next day I warmed the filling up a tad in the microwave (basically just took the "chill" off). I used 1 pkg of ready made pizza dough. I spread it out over a large cookie sheet which I had sprayed with Butter Flavored Pam. I spooned all of the filling mixture onto the dough and made sure that the "overlapping" dough went on the TOP of the roll instead of the bottom. I wanted to make sure that the dough didn't remain "doughy" as other reviewers had stated. I took a sharp knife and just slit the tops of the dough in a nice 'braid-like' way and then brushed on my egg white. I baked it for the recommended amount of time and it was nice and brown and cooked throughout. No doughy-ness! :) I should have taken a picture but the smell was heaven and we wanted to eat! ha ha

Very good recipe, but next time I'll add more cheddar cheese - could barely taste it.  Also the dill is quite powerful, so decrease if you are not a dill fan.  The braid directions are a bit confusing.  After pressing the two tubes of cresent rolls together to form a sheet on the baking pan, I simply cut two 1" strips and rolled them to form two long strings.  The large strip of dough remaining on the pan, I pinched around all edges to form a little lip to hold the chicken mixture.  Then I criss-crossed the two long strings of dough across the chicken mixture and pinched the dough on the pan to the dough strings where they met together on the sides.  The chicken mixture did not run out on the pan and the dish baked beautifully!

I covered the bottom of a jelly roll pan with one can of rolls.  I prepared the filling as directed but held out the almonds.  I cut the second can of rolls into strips and latticed the top, sprinkled with almonds, then brushed with egg white. The quantities worked out perfectly and the end result was beautiful and delicious.

This was SOOOO good. I've made it twice in two weeks. You do need to steam or sautee the veggies before baking. I doubled the amount of almonds in the recipe - we liked the extra crunch. I also enjoyed the amount of dill the recipe calls for even though many other reviewers thought it was too much. We like a lot of seasoning to our food. I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo for some extra zing.

Made as is...my husband and 7yo loved this, but I thought it had a peculiar sweet taste...maybe from the almonds or the crescent rolls. Hubby took the leftovers for lunch and ate it cold, still loved it!

I have to say that this was disappointing.  I made this for Christmas eve and no one commented on this being good or bad.  In my opinion, the dill was way too overpowering.  Next time, I will try adding other spices/flavors such as garlic powder or maybe even lemon pepper and not dill.  Sorry.

I have to say, I love this recipe.  I have been making it for along time. I do encourage everyone to print this recipe and try it.  It is a great meal.  The braid appears that you have been slaving over it and it is pretty easy to make.

Excellent!  Gave it my own twist though.  Used green beans in place of broccoli, a little mozz in addition to the cheddar, left out the dill (don't care for it), and only used one can of crescents.  I actually only had one can and thought I could get by on that, however it was a stretch, but I just broke out some phillo pastry dough and put some pieces over the top and then put the egg white all over the top, came out excellent!  I think the pastry dough over the top really did it quite well.

I made this for my bridge club and they loved it!  It needed a bit more mayo.  Next time I'll make the dough strips narrower so I can easily make 1" slices.

This was amazing! I had to cut it in half because I only had 1 cup of cooked chicken and 1 pkg. of crescent rolls. I used the leftover breast of the deli rotisserie chicken and leftover broccoli. I skipped the almonds because the kids don't like them. The only other thing I did was I omitted the egg white because I forgot to put it on. It worked perfectly! We will definitely be making this again.

I leave the almonds out, but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly and LOVE it. Lots of taste and easy to make - don't let the braid scare you away - it's not a big deal :) I've made this quite a few times and it turns out great every time.

This recipe is good the way it says here. What I have found is even better is use the same seasonings, but use steak and mushrooms instead of chicken and broccoli.

Simple yummy dinner! I seasoned the chicken when I cooked it. Next time I'll season everything more and cook the onions in a skillet before adding them into the mixture. Next time I would also lightly grease my baking sheet because my braid stuck. 

The cresent roll instructions were sort of confusing (but maybe because I was chasing a 2 year old while making it). You put all the cresent rolls together, sealing the perforations, then cut the edges to make strips to braid over the top. 

I'll definitely make it again, but maybe with pizza toppings or BBQ chicken and red onions.

i used half the mayo and 1 1/2 cups cheese. I also doubled the garlic. I made the braid on parchment paper for easy transferring and even easier clean up. I made two smaller braids for faster cooking. To do this from each package of crescent rolls I lined the four rectangles up long edges touching. To cook I waited until the crust was a nice golder brown, then covered with foil to prevent further browning. I Then returned the braid to the over and continued cooking until the center reached 140 degrees F.

Ii have made this twice  now and it was such a hit both times! Today I brought it to a gathering of several coworkers and it was gone before anything else and everyone wants the recipe.  The first time I made it I forgot the mayo.  By the time I realized it, it was to late to add it, so I poked some holes in the dough and drizzled in some olive oil.  It was delicious.  This time, I made it a bit too thick in the middle, so it wasn't as consistently sized as it should have been, but still delicious.  Can't wait to try it with different ingredients and flavors the next time I have leftover meat.

AMAZING and it looks beautiful with little effort. I followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the dill because I don't like it. It didn't last long. Since then, I have made it with different fillings and it is delicious. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent!  My entire family loved it.  I followed recipe except I used a rotisserie chicken from local grocer.  Just as a time saver.  This is so fast and easy to make.  Will definitely be making again!  Thanks.

3.5 Stars: I halved the recipe, but doubled the chicken.  The dill is very strong and it pretty much just tasted like ranch dressing.  I was the only one in my house who liked it.

Just made this for supper. It turned out quite well and was simple to assemble. I definitely recommend flipping through the pictures with the recipe, makes the "braiding" of the dough instructions much easier to understand when you see the dough laid out and cut up. Left out the dill and red pepper as per personal preference, and added a sprinkle of poultry seasoning, marjoram and thyme. Would probably make again when there are 4 to feed. I don't think it would reheat as well because of the crescent rolls. Nice and crispy from oven. Beautiful.

Made this for the first time and the hubby and i both LOVED it. Substituted yellow bell peppers for red, pecans for almonds, omitted the onions and doubled the garlic. Did everything else by the recipe. Next time I will use half the dill weed and add parsley. This recipe could be done so many different ways! Glad to have another go-to easy recipe.

I loved this!  Very flavorful, 2 year old child liked it, also good cold in the morning!  I did botch the braid, - I doubled the broccoli and red pepper - just for more veggies -  so it was bursting at the seams and looked like a giant blob mess, but tasted wonderful.  Will definitely make again soon!

This was awesome! I used a little more of the veggies to load up on the healthy stuff and I only had fat free miracle whip which I prefer over mayo anyway. I also didn't have the dill so I threw in some italian seasoning and oregano instead. This paired all my favorite things and was better than I expected. I think I will be making this at least once a month from now on.

simple and yummy.  Used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise (because I don't like mayo) and used garlic powder instead of the chunks of garlic clove.  Was probably a little sweeter than the original recipe, but tasted great!

This was good. I cooked the chicken in a skillet, then added the onion, then dumped those two things in a bowl, sauteed the pepper and then sauteed the broccoli a bit. I left out the almonds and skipped the egg white. It was still golden on the top.

This is really good and looks so nice when it comes outta the oven. I used only one pack crescent roll, otherwise it woulda been enormous! I was cooking for two. I always use a bit more cheese and when i cook my chicken i add Mrs dash chicken seas..so flavorful. Two tsp is plenty of dill, don't overuse unless you want it tart! Overall very yummy:)

I used light mayo and added a little Caesar salad dressing to the mixture.  I did not use the almonds.  The vegetables were cooked fine.  When you lay out the dough, lay one package of the crescent dough down on your cookie sheet, then lay the other package right next to it (not below it).  It was very good.  I will make it again.  It's a great for a super bowl party!  Enjoy!

This was so easy and sooo delicious. I added a bit more cheese and broccoli. It was gooey and creamy. Next time i may make a vegetarian version with potatoes for all of my hippie vegetarian friends. Excellent. and it looks so pretty!

Very Good recipe! I used carrots instead of red pepper and used italian seasonning instead of the dill. Turned out great! Must admit that is it time consuming if starting from scratch but very easy if chicken and veggies are cooked ahead of time. Thanks to WAFFELZ
for the diagram on how to braid the crescent rolls! I look forward to trying other combinations in the future.

This rocked the house. My wife and kids all agreed - I am king!... I used a little extra dried dill (as previous comments said to), but still didn't taste it much... Didn't matter. I will be knighted by weeks end.

Family LOVED it!  I however just couldn't get through my piece, the taste of mayo was just too much for me in this dish.  I will make again and definitely cut that down.

This is my go-to recipe for potlucks. All the ingredients for the filling can be prepped a day ahead and placed in the refrigerator, and then you can put it together when you need it (most often for us, it's in the morning, as this makes frequent appearances at our church potlucks). Everyone is always impressed by this, and it's not just the braiding. The taste is fantastic.

In addition to the spices listed, I initially poach my chicken in Penzey's FoxPoint seasoning. Poaching the chicken prevents it from drying out, as can sometimes happen when it's cooked too fast through boiling. I  use sliced, rather than slivered, almonds because I like the way they look and they brown beautifully as the braid bakes.

I have had so many requests for this recipe and people find it difficult to believe how simple it is. But it really is quick and easy and delicious.

First had this at a Pampered Chef Party...  We alter the recipe every time (optional: peppers, water chestnuts, scallions, diced green chilis...).  After we moved, and I was back in my kitchen, this is one of the first recipes he requested me to make.

Used fresh pizza dough, 2T fresh dill, just enough mayo to moisten, little extra cheese, and baked at 375 for 28 mins.  Came out slightly browned, would've liked more, but still pretty darn good.  Probably would increase to 400, cook for 30-35 mins or until all golden brown next time.

Potluck favorite. Instead of crescent rolls I use the 'white bread' recipe on allrecipes for the dough.  I sauté the onions and garlic.

This is a great recipe but as I'm a vegetarian I modified as follows: First off, no chicken and no almonds. I used at least 3 cups of brocolli, 1 1/2 onions and 1/2 of a yellow, red and orange bell pepper, 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped, 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp dried dill weed (2 tsp is way too much for me). I sauteed the onions for several minutes, then added the garlic and peppers. After a few more minutes, I added the chopped broccoli, salt, oregano, red pepper flakes, dill weed and onion flakes (they really added good flavor). I let that sit on the heat for about 3 minutes. Then I turned off the heat but covered the mixture so that the steam could continue to cook the broccoli. Once I the mixture cooled, I added the cheese and mayo. i just eyeballed it but I know I used less than a 1/2 cup of mayo because the mixture is already moist from satueeing the veggies. I HIGHLY recommend sauteeing the veggies! Lastly, I parted the mixture into sections and this got me 4 braids worth. I used one roll for each braid (I'm not clear from the recipe if they combined the 2 rolls to make a big one). I rolled out each sheet to make it thinner, then placed the mixture down the center, then cut the strips to braid it. I brushed them with the egg white and cooked them at 300 degrees for about 25 minutes (rotating the tray once in b/t) then another 15-20 minutes on 350 degrees. I know I modified it to suit me but still a great recipe as is. Thanks Kelly!

This is a new family favorite.  It makes it into our rotation monthly (if not more often).  It's so easy to mix it up with a change of meat and veggie.  It's even a great way to use up leftovers!

Pretty good, but I get 2 braids out of this recipe.  I didn't really measure the vegetables, but eyeballed them. Still, it seemed like a lot more veggies and chicken than one braid could handle, so I ended up with 2.  I also made the crescent roll dough myself--I generally use the Golden Crescent Roll recipe on here for anything calling for crescent rolls, and I got enough out of that recipe for two braids as well.  So, I made one roll for friends who just had a baby (which I originally intended it for) and for us.  Pretty good.  Bf loved the dough and liked the combo.  this is very similar to the other chicken braid on here; just different veggies, but they are both pretty good.  I disagree with the serving sizes (since I got two braids, I think it's at least double 6 servings!).  The braiding seems difficult but is pretty easy.  I find it easier to make the cuts with a knife and even if you cut more on one side than the other, don't worry.  Just braid it in and it'll bake up lovely.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, thanks, Kelly. Made it exactly to the recipe, and it was delicious. Next time will substitute diced celery for the almonds (family preference; if you like almonds, by all means use them). One thing I would recommend, with the amounts listed, you may want to buy two cans of crescent rolls and make two braids--we had filling left over. An easy-to-make, comfort-food dish we will make again.

this was delicious, but I took others' advice. i cooked the chicken in some oil and then added the onions and pepper and cooked those for a few minutes. i also steamed the broccoli to crisp-tender in advance. i like the use of dill and almonds. delicious and pretty and fairly easy, this is definitely going in our rotation.

Delicious! I sauteed the garlic, broccoli and red peppers first as suggested, to elimimate too much crunch. My husband dislikes mayo,so I used Spicy Ranch with a tbsp. of mayo to thicken. I didn't care much about presentation, so I put one package of crescent roll on the bottom and one on the top, folded the sides up like a calzone. Cooked and tasted great!

I have made a similar recipe for years and everyone always loves it. When I didn't have crescent rolls handy I just used frozen bread dough and rolled it out flat and made the braid the same way you do with the crescents and it turned out just as good

This was very easy to make I sauteed the veggies before.  I also added salt, pepper and Italian seasonings to the top of the bread so it wouldn't be so bland. I baked it on 200 for about 30 minutes then craked it up to 325 for about 10. I was worried about the crust cooking all the way, and it turned out perfect!

Makes an elegant looking meal...as is!  Quick and easy and very tasty.! Everybody loved it!  The servings shown is "6" -- but if you use 2 crescent pkgs -- it makes much more.  Highly recommended.

I've tried this twice, both times cooking it longer than called for, and both times the dough still doesn't cook all the way through in the middle. It still tasted great though, just ate around the uncooked dough.

Delicious!! I sauted some finly chopped onions, peppers, and garlic in a tsp of butter before adding to the rest of the ingredients. I also used frozen broccoli (cooked) instead of fresh. As for the cheese, I forgot to add it into the rest of the mix and remembered just before I put it in the oven, so I opened it back up and added it to the top of the mix then reclosed it. I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar just because thats what I like better and I didn't have dill or almonds so that was not added, but I did add some spices that I had on hand...italian seasoning I think it's called.

It smells so good and looks beautiful when served.  I cut it into 1 inch slices and people grabbed them up!!  Be sure to paint egg white over entire pastry to give it a golden brown color.

Very good and easy!  I added some ranch dressing because I was craving it, I think it adds some good zip!

Quite yummy. I messed up and bought biscuits in the can, but I pieced them together and made it work. Somehow I actually managed to braid it and it looked nice too.
UPDATE: I have made this about a dozen times and it is always a hit. I never use red peppers (person preference) and steam the broccoli. Instead of straight salt, I add a Penzey's Fox Point.

I didn't care for this at all.  I did use ranch dressing as mentioned in other reviews and omitted the dill and almonds as they are not family favorites. I also added fresh mushrooms, which ended up being the best part. It doesn't even matter that I couldn't get the braiding right, it was just blah.  Tasted like the old pot pies my mom used to buy frozen and serve us as kids. No chance of making this again, even though my husband said it wasn;t "that bad".

DON'T add onions! it overpowers the dish and makes everything taste the same. The idea was good, just needs some tweaking like more spices and cheese and less onion.

Awesome, however I made a few changes. I omitted the mayo and used ranch and italian dressing instead. I sprinkled some dill but for the most part you couldn't taste it. And I cooked the veggies with the chicken per other people's reviews. The almonds added a nice crunch! It was yum, will definitely make again!

I really impressed my husband with this dish - not only pretty but tasty.  Next time I may make the filling the day before to let the flavors blend before I make it.  The broccoli was a bit strong but in the leftovers it had mellowed out and the other flavors came thru.

Looked great and tasted great! I made my own dough. Left out the onion and almonds and pre-cooked the broccoli and red peppers with the garlic. Delicious!

Good - I halved the recipe, pre-cooked the vegetables (omitted the pepper and almonds) and used 1/2 t. dill.  I put the garlic through a press.  I baked on parchment - didn't stick at all.  I'm a little confused about using 2 cans of crescent rolls.  Mine was pretty long just using one can.

4.5 stars - This came out great!  I did pre-cook the veggies a little.  Forgot to brush on egg white, oops, but it still came out beautifully.  Only took 24 mins, not sure if that was due to no egg?  I also added some small chopped carrots, a 4oz can of mushrooms, and only 1tsp of fresh dill and used 1 crescent solid dough sheet.  Could stand a little more cheese, but thats just me (will sprinkle a little more on next time before wrapping).  We also made one of these using ground beef:  left meat a little chunkier, stew-like veggies (small cubed red potatoes, carrots, celery, green pepper) and seasonings (basil, thyme, worc. sauce) with a bit of broth thickened with cornstarch to moisten.  Also came out great, BF gives it 5 stars!  Very adaptable recipe, love it.  Thanks for sharing it.

This was a quick and easy dinner!  The broccoli wasn't as done as it could have been, so I would recommend a few more min cooking time depending on the tendencies of your stove.  But even so - this was great.

I also got this recipe from Pampered Chef years ago. I've used it for showers, book club and the family. It's somewhat labor intensive and very high in fat, but delicious. My recipe doesn't call for onion, but I'll try some of the variations listed here.

Omitted the dill, substituted miracle whip for mayo, used moz and parm instead of cheddar and added some fresh rosemary and Italian seasoning.  Also sauteed the broccoli in with the onion and garlic with some olive oil.

This is an excellent recipe.  I found the dill to be a bit much, so since the first time making it I only use half of what the recipe recommends.  Other than that, it is fantastic.

This was SO good and EASY!!!! I steamed the broccoli and sauteed the garlic, onion and red pepper before mixing it all together. Also, I was scared of the braid so I laid the first roll of croissants out and went over the lightly with a rolling pin then I after I put everything on top of that I laid the other on top stretching it a bit...I then folded the sides so nothing would come out. Then I cut slits in the to to kinda look like a braid ; )! It was ssssoooo good!!! I served with risotto which I added spinach leaves to.  I do have a pic on here of it.

this is one of my families favorite dinner meals. Esp. if we have company. It is easy to fix and looks impressive. I sometimes uses half the mayo and replace the other half with yogurt for a healthier meal.

I'm sorry to post a poor review, but this recipe was just not for us. I like all the ingredients on their own, but together it was not a hit.

Fantastic!  My whole family loved this recipe, the teenager devoured every remaining last bite.  The only changes that I made was to triple the garlic, half the dill and to sautee all the veggies lightly before baking.  It looks & tastes wonderful, would be good for company - makes it look like you slaved over a hot stove for hours, but in reality is very easy to make.

I had this recipe at a friend's house and absolutely loved it.  It was made without the onions and almonds and tasted wonderful without them.     The lady used sharp cheddar cheese and only 1 tsp. of the dried dill, although I think I will cut that down to 1/2 tsp. since the taste of dill was still just a touch strong.    This was such a delicious recipe and the lady raved about how easy it was to prepare!  It looked fabulous for a holiday party!!  It is a definite addition to my party list!!

I scaled for 12 servings.  6 people ate all of it in one sitting.  I added mushrooms, 50% more cheese, and crushed red pepper.  This was delicious.  I will be making this again for sure.

I went to the grocery with an imaginary list, and I forgot to buy red pepper and  dill. But even like this, the recipe turned out great. Unfortunatelly my family had pizza just before I finished cooking by braid, so most of it waits to be eaten. I loved it though!

YUM!  I've made this twice now, halving  the recipe for two of us and baking only about 12 minutes.  The second time I made some changes which made it even better (my bf wanted thirds but by then it was gone!): halved the chicken called for and used 1.5 times called for of the broccoli and red bell pepper.  The dill, which a lot of people have complained about, was more subtle when combined with more veggies and less chicken.  Next I'm I'll use even more veggies.  Ohh one more note -- I've tried both slivered and sliced almonds depending on what I have on hand and you really do get a better texture with the slivered.

My mom made this for when I was little and I was the only one in the family who liked it.  Now that I am married I found this recipe and it takes me back!  I love that this recipe is easy and there is little prep.  This is one of my family's favorites.

I first saw this recipe in a Pampered Chief cookbook and found it to be a really good recipe. My family and friends really do enjoy it. I would suggest NOT using Miracle Whip in place of mayo, it messes up the flavor. Also, bake for a little longer to make sure the bread is cooked fully or else the bread is soggy and makes the meal not taste so good.

Big hit with our family! I didn't mind the mayo too much...but I think next time I try it I'll do 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cream cheese. YUMMY!

I used canned chicken, frozen broccoli and basil instead of dill.  I also left out the red pepper, almonds, and onion because I didn't have any.  I'm sure it would be even better if you follow the recipe!  This was easy but looks fancy and tastes really good.

The first time I made it I followed the recipe except for using 2 little jalapenos instead of red pepper.  The flavor of the pepper was over power and before popping in the oven.  I TOUCHED MY FACE!  OW!  

The second time, I used spinach, Italian seasonings, Italian cheese blend, sliced black olives and chicken.  After braiding, I put olives slices on top.  AMAZING!!!

With the egg wash and the braid it turns out so beautifully, and it wows people.  But it's so deceptively easy!

My neighbor's son, who detests vegetables, gobbled this up, despite it being laden with broccoli and peppers.

Next time I'll add more cheese or some salt to counter the sweetness of the crescent dough.

This recipe was good, but not as good as I had hoped.  I put a little extra broccoli and less dill than the recipe called for and used mozz. cheese instead of cheddar because it was all I had.  I think next time I will stick to the recipe and use cheddar though!  I also didn't use any peppers and onions and garlic powder instead of fresh.  These were all things I had on hand, I didn't want to run to the grocery!  A neat recipe though, I will try again with the right cheese.

This recipe came out great and I really enjoyed making it.  Pillsbury just came out with "Recipe Creations" which is a single sheet of the cresent roll dough so you don't have to fuss with the smoothing out the cut lines.  I put 2 together for this recipe.  I also followed the advice of others and steamed the broccoli, and sauteed the red pepper, onions, and garlic in a little bit of olive oil.  I over roasted 2 bone-in chicken breasts for the meat.  Everyone really enjoyed this meal.

A really good idea for refashioning leftovers.  As others mentioned, I lightly sauteed the veggies, skipped the dill and added fresh oregano and basil instead, and used garlic crescents.  I made one braid with and the other without the eggwash - my family preferred without, which is fine with me.

I make this using only the chicken, broccoli, cheese, mayo and Pampered Chef dill seasoning. I also forgo the braid and just roll it right into the crescent roll triangles. (use 2 cans of cresecent rolls, I buy the ones that are 50% bigger) It still comes out very pretty.

Wow, this was very, very good.  Not hard at all to put together, even if you can't braid...  I sauteed the onion, garlic and also some celery.  Steamed the broccoli for about 5 minutes.  Once I started adding the chicken mixture I didn't think it would all fit, but I had no problem.  Not fond of egg wash, so I didn't do that.  I also used parchment paper.  This was done to perfection in 25 minutes exactly.  Sure will do this one again, many times!!  Thank you!!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and my husband and I thought it was really yummy. I did however make a few changes. Since we are veggie people I added a little less chicken than the recipe and then added chopped, fresh carrots, celery, green bell pepper, and califlower. I thought it was incredible yummy with all the wonderful veggie flavors mixed with the cheese and chicken. This is a keeper!

Very good, I used canned chicken to save time and added extra red pepper.  Tasty and attractive!

This recipe was good.  I used reduced fat cresent rolls which made it even more delicious, i think!

We love this recipe in our house.  I have made it with the crescent roll as suggested and also with the canned pizza dough and both are absolutely delicious.  Great way to use up leftover chicken and really easy to put together.  Excellent!

My husband and i really liked this recipe with a few changes. I am way to lazy to "braid" it so i just used the Pillsbury can of pizza dough found right next to the crescents. I just mixed everything up and unrolled the dough on the cookie sheet. I smeared all the ingredients on top of the pizza dough and rolled it up. Next time i will leave out some of the onion and red pepper as we don't particularly care for those two ingredients.

To save time I used a grocery store rotisserie chicken as some reviewers suggested.  Mistake.  Since these birds are so salty and pumped with who knows what, the texture was weird and tasted like tuna.  Will try again with chicken breasts that I cook myself.

I have made this for work potlucks and for family dinners.  It looks like it takes forever to make but it's really easy.  It takes more time to get the perforations out of the crescent dough than anything!  I figure when even the teenagers who are "allergic" to anything green say that it's good, it's a winner

Truly delicious and very well-received at a party I had at my home.  I used a pre-roasted chicken from the grocery store, which made things very easy.  Chopped and mixed up the filling ahead of time and then baking it at party time was no problem at all!  Wonderful!

Despite looking very hard to make, this was easy and it made me look like I knew how to cook.  The only thing I would change is to add less dill.  I like dill but this much was over powering.  Also I followed some of the other advice and sauteed the vegetables before baking which gave them a better flavor.

This recipe has become a family favorite. The kids love it! It is wonderful for entertaining because it has such a lovely presentation. If you want to save on calories, you can use one can of crescent rolls spread thin. We actually make it that way when its just our family ~ when we're entertaining we'll use two cans. I also generally use about half or third of the mayo required but only because I detest mayo. I don't even measure...I just scoop out a glop and stir it in.

My husband loves this recipe and I make it fairly often.  I lightened it a little by using Light Mayo and Reduced Fat Crescent Rolls.  I also make 2 small braids vs one large one.

I love this recipe! It looks really nice for get togethers and it tastes great. I bought a rotesserie chicken and diced up the meet for a more succulent flavor. I also added a little parmasean cheese in the feeling and sprinkled some on the top. I thought it did fine at 28 minutes you want to make sure the inside isn't doey and i Kind of like it a little crisper on the outside, more pleasing to the pallet. I will make this again I think I will trying using sour cream instead as others suggested...more garlic too!

This was easy and really good. I was a little intimidated by the assembly of the crescent rolls, but it was fine. The only thing I think would improve the taste is to saute the veggies 1st before adding to the mixture.

We replaced the mayo with sour cream and increased the onion. It was fantastic! The flavor was intense and tangy. The peppers were subtle. The kids loved it. I think this will be a staple.

A definite favorite around our house.  I used a similar recipe many times that called for cream of chicken soup and water chestnuts in place of the mayo and almonds.  But we like this one even better.  I make mine in a wreath shape instead of the braid.

I really liked this recipe.  I've used pizza dough and cresent roll dough and I like the pizza dough better because it is less flaky and buttery.  Also, I have substituted the mayo for the same amount of Cream of Mushroom.  Although I like them both, if you are going for a more savory and less tangy I would use cream of mushroom straight out of the can.  Great !

This recipe was very simple.  I did substitute a couple ingredients to suit my family, but the biggest change was using pizza dough in place of the crescent rolls.  My family members are so picky, but they said this was "good".

This is one of my family's very favorites. To save time, this can be made as individual (not braided) "pockets" which cook faster and are lunch box friendly the next day.

If this hadn't turned out so good I wouldn't review or rate this as unusually for me I made quite a few changes through necessity. I used pizza dough can't get crescent roll dough in England at least not where I live. I also left out the dill I like it while I'm eating it but don't like the aftertaste. I also braided it slightly differently and maybe because I used pizza dough it all melded together while cooking. I also took other reviewers advice on how to make  a smaller one for my vegetarian daughter used all the same veggies and added mushrooms. The rest of us had this with the chicken. Oh yes and i used leftover steamed broccoli and sauteed the onions. All this said this was fantastic
we all loved it. Thanks for a great meal.

This was AWESOME! I loved it! I will say that I did have difficulty 'braiding' it. The crescent dough started to get too sticky to work with and I was trying to work quickly. So while it didn't look braided (more lumpy), it was really really delicious!
I made it for a surprise party and was asked for the recipe.

This was ok, but the kids said they would rather have the chicken baked by itself and the crescents on the side. I think I agree. My Husband really loved it though.

My wife loved this and was really impressed that I could make something that looked so good.  I liked it, but not as much as she did.  I thought the brocolli and peppers were a little too crunchy, so next time I will probably cook them a little before putting into the mix.  I am not entirely sure I did the dough correctly, but it seemed a little too doughy to me.  Overall, 4 stars.  I think next time I make it with a few modifications it will be a 5.

This dish came out wonderfully. I read through the reviews to get a better idea of how to make it a braid. I omitted the dill weed since I'm not a dill fan and it was fantastic.  All my guests loved it.

I was surprised by how good this is! I only had one roll of crescent dough so I made a half recipe and shaped it in a long braid. I sauteed the broccoli, garlic, and onion together so they wouldn't be to "raw" when it was finished. I didn't have any red bell pepper. It got rave reviews.

FABULOUS!!!! I made this last night for a Xmas party and sad to say I have no more leftovers!  I sauteed the chicken first in a little olive oil and one clove of garlic.  Instead of onion, I used scallions, YUM!  in addition to the filling, I added one more clove of garlic!  Generous amounts of cheddar and the right amount of brocoli, it turned out SUPERB!  My guests couldn't get enough, I even made two! It wasn't difficult to "braid" and it came out so pretty! I can't stress how tasty it was and how "professional" it looked, it definitely impressed my guests! I will  keep this in my recipe box! Thank you!

This recipe is GREAT!  I did change it up some.  I reduced the mayo, and added some cream cheese.  I also left out the dill/almonds/red pepper.  I used canned chunk chicken for convienence.  The braid is not well explained.  Think of it as a rectangular log.  You spread dough out on cookie sheet and cut 2/3 IN to middle about every inch...put mix down middle and bring up side pieces to form log/braid.  It is beautiful!

My boyfriend and I loved this.  I was out of cheddar cheese so I used Mozzarella and American!  It still came out yummy.  I cooked the broccoli first because I hate broccoli thats not cooked.  I can't wait to try different ingredients in this recipe.

This recipe is quick and a great idea for using the crecent dough.  Vary the ingredients and kids will love it!  I made it as described except without dill.  I wasn't hugely impressed though - almond and onion tasted strange together.

This has always been one of our favorites, and I've been making it for years (got the recipe at a Pampered Chef party). We like the filling, so I add extra broccoli to bulk it up a bit.  I leave out the bell pepper if I don't have any on hand, and add a little extra almonds because we like that crunch.

Delicious. I used thawed frozen broccoli instead of fresh. I used 1/8 tsp of garlic powder instead of crushed garlic and I omitted the almonds. Everyone loved it including myself

instead of using crescent rolls, I used bread dough I made in my bread machine. I think the dill weed added a unique flavor to this.

This recipe is very easy and tastes great.  I have passed it on to many friends.  Rather than make one big crescent roll, I make two slim rolls.

Pampered Chef featured an almost identical recipe several years ago, only difference is the onion.  Can use turkey, and I've made it on a pizza stone in a round wreath shape - nice that way as a holiday brunch dish (with the green broccoli and red pepper peaking through).  Make sure to check the bottom, sometimes it takes longer to cook through and is doughy, even though the top is brown.

This is delicious! I used extra firm tofu (put right into mixture, no prior cooking) instead of chicken and added yellow bell peppers! Great with applesauce as a side. Going to add corn in it next time as well.

I didn’t make any changes. It blew my brunch guests away; everyone went back for seconds. New favorite brunch recipe.

Beware not to make so much stuffing that it doesn't cook all the way inside. In order to help the inside not be so mushy, use one of the pizza pans with holes all over so that way everything inside cooks thoroughly without risking burning the crescent roll. But when you remember to do that its a 5 star for sure :)

I’ve made this three times as I type this review. The egg white brush over the dough is a must, you’ll get a crumbly, almost burnt result otherwise; the egg white really gives you that crisp golden layer you want. We like the honey wheat croissant rolls. The almond slivers were perfect for the sake of texture. Rotisserie chicken is SO much better than using canned chicken. If you can prep the filling and leave it overnight the flavors mix and your results are better. Making it again tomorrow!

That is too much dill for our taste.  Sometimes I trade it for basil.  I saute my veggies before putting them in, otherwise they will be too crunchy.  I've had a hard time getting it to cook in the middle so I've started to make a square out of two of the triangles and bring all four corners up and twist to make individual little pockets.  We love the filling and make this often.

Had this at a Pampered Chef party years ago and thought about it today. This is just like I remembered. So easy to put together. And the best part, my kids loved it! My daughter said I need to make sure to make this often. High praise from a picky girl.

I used leftovers to make this and it was such a hit, I had to make it again!  I followed everything exact except, I used croissant dough, not the rolls - pillsbury sells them.  When I cut the strips, I did it at an angle down and away from the filling to make the braid and it turned out magazine perfect!   Next time I will use other ingredients - possibly BBQ chicken.

This recipe is awesome, but I suggest using puff pastry rather than crescent roll dough. The braid turns out flakier and lighter this way.

I made this ahead for my boyfriend and froze it. In 2 halves. Not sure how to tell him to heat it. Thinking of a microwave defrost and then oven to crisp up. Wondering about fridge defrost and oven crisp up but concerned about sogginess. 
Would love suggestions on this.

I loved this recipe so much that I tried a couple of variations.  The first was to substitute pepperoni. and Oliverio. peppers with Italian cheese. The other was to use mashed potatoes, pork sausage, and. cheddar cheese.  Try these or create some of your own.

First time making it. I substituted fresh mushrooms for the red bell pepper , used 8 oz of cream of chicken ready to serve soup for the mayo. Used Italian grinder herbs and seasoning to accent the taste. A friend stopped by, had to try some... family and friend loved it and now, has become one of their favorites, asking for more!

I make this about ten times a year.  I use pizza dough instead of crescents, that's the only change.  My friends and family love it.  I'm always giving out the recipe.

This was truly a hit with my entire family, children included. I did do a couple of things differently since I needed this to look kid friendly.  First I finely chopped all of the ingredients making it logo more like chicken salad in the middle...the kids didn't even realize the green stuff was broccoli! They though it was just one of mommy's fresh herbs...second I used very little red bell pepper...just enough to give a hint of flavor. Most of family are not big fans of the red bell pepper, but as I was tasting along the way, I knew it needed that extra little taste...so when I make this I only put in two small slices (about 1/4 inch each), chop them with my chopper extremely fine and it add just enough of depth to the dish without it being overwhelmed with the taste of the pepper. Hint: the kids love to roll out the crescent roll dough braid it and paint the outside with the egg whites...perfect sweet to tangy ratio in this recipe!!!

This is a Pampered Chef recipe that I have been making for years.  In the summer I make extra filling and eat it as is with out the bread.  Great either way.

I made this for the first time tonight, with a few changes, and my family loved it! Even my 6 year old, who doesn't like vegetables, asked to have it again. I used 2 1/2 cups chicken, which I cooked with the onion, some olive oil, garlic powder (I didn't have any fresh garlic), celery salt, and pepper. I used way more cheese then it calls for too! I used 1/2 the dill and an extra tablespoon of almonds. I also substituted plain Greek yogurt for the mayo, same amount. You definitely need to cook the broccoli beforehand. I blanched it like was suggested by another reviewer and it was still a a little too crunchy when the whole thing was done. Using only the florets and not the stem helps with that. The most important thing is to spread the dough thinly and set your timer for less time so you can keep a eye on it. It only needed 18 minutes to cook perfectly - golden brown with the bottom cooked nicely and not burnt NOT 25 minutes like it calls for. We will definitely be eating this again. We had extra filling that wouldn't fit in the pastry shell and it's good on its own too. My husbands taking the leftovers to work with crackers. It's like a new take on chicken salad. Yummy!
Addendum: I did not use red bell pepper

This is really good and easy to make (though the braiding part is a little challenging if you are clumsy and in a hurry!). I didn't have any almonds and forgot to buy them, so I made it without and it was still awesome. I also used fresh dill. Will definitely make again and again.

I love making this and it is in my regular dinner rotation now.  My 13-year-old daughter loves it too.  I have made a couple of changes, just based upon personal preference.  I do not add almonds.  I add peas and about 1/2 cup of cream of chicken soup, which seems to give it a good flavor.  I also add fresh black pepper.  One other thing I tried tonight when I made it was cook the broccoli for just about 5 minutes before putting it in the mixture, just so it isn't as crunchy.  Delicious!  It will remain a staple in my family.  Makes great leftovers for lunches too.

I'm giving it a rating of 2 because Ryan and I didn't think it was "that bad," but it also wasn't raving good.  None of the kids ate it.  I don't plan on making it again, unless I figure out a way to make my own dough.  Maybe it's just us because we don't eat processed foods much, but that crescent roll stuff is AWFUL!!!  The filling was OK but probably needed more seasonings of some sort.  Also, I think adding a creaminess to it (roux with cream maybe?) would make it a better filling.

I had lost my favorite Pampered chef cook book in our last move when the boys requested this today.  I was so excited to find it on allrecipes.  It's my "go to" recipe when I have company or want to use up some precooked chicken.  The easy braiding of the crescent rolls always impresses people (and I'm not an impressive cook!)  Those who say it burns too easy, perhaps, have rolled the crescent dough too thin, or cut the strips too thin.  Keeping the braid the same width from middle to ends is also important.  Chopping the broccoli and peppers small also helps for even cooking time.  No one has ever complained that the broccoli was crispy, and the youngest doesn't even know it has it!  Please don't tell him :-)

I made a number of changes: 1) Didn't use a pepper, garlic, almonds, dill weed, or mayo. 2) I added ranch dressing instead of mayo. 3) Used colby-cheddar cheese instead of cheddar. 4) Steamed the broccoli. It was like a casserole in a crescent roll wrap. Yum! My family loved it. We ate every last bite!

We had a group of college kids over and they loved this.  It does take a little time to make.  Pillsbury is now making a "crescent roll" dough that is not perforated but all in a single sheet (it's right next to the rest of the rolls in our grocery store), so that saved the step of having to close up the perforations.

Very easy and delicious! I made the recipe exact to the instructions, but there is lots of room to customize. Will make again! :)

I've never heard of chicken and broccoli bread but it was so good and had a lot of flavor. My kid really liked even if she hates my cooking.

We love this.  I always cut the dill down because my husband isn't a big fan-I do about 1 tsp instead-maybe less.  I also pre-cook my fresh broccoli and used dried minced onion (precook onion if you use it unless you want a crunch).  We skip the bell pepper also because my guys aren't fans.  I don't do the egg wash over the top-I actually got this recipe from someone in a recipe exchange but couldn't remember all the details so I found this and it was the exact same as hers except for the egg wash.

Its ok. Didnt braid it, just folded sides over the top and pinched it closed (looked like giant hot pocket).  Save money and skip the nuts. They dont add enough flavor to justify spending $4 on tiny packet of slivered almonds.

This was very good.  I made it at the last minute to go with some homemade soup on a very cold windy night.  I halved the recipe but didn't change anything except reducing the dill somewhat.  When I make it again, and I will, I will leave the dill measurement as is and reduce the baking time just a bit and add more nuts.  The crescent rolls were burned around the edges and on the bottom just slightly.  Thanks!  Just a small update:  these do NOT reheat well.  I had halved the recipe and still had leftovers and when I tried reheating in the microwave, the rolls went completely mushy.  Maybe a better alternative would be to make the stuffing and stuff individual rolls, rather making the whole thing.

I've made this several times and it's never failed to be amazing! I don't use almonds or dill, but I do season the chicken while I'm cooking it with Culinary Secrets Northwoods Chicken Seasoning (which every household should have). I've also done it with cauliflower and broccoli, instead of red bell pepper, and I've done it without the onion (hubby doesn't like onions but I usually sneak it in there anyway). It's always so good and so flavorful. I also sprinkle some shredded cheddar on top of it when there's about 10-15 minutes left.

Fresh broccoli, leftover chicken (from the freezer), and a few other ingredients made a quick, comforting meal.  The dill was a nice addition.  Except for ommitting the almonds (personal choice), I made the dish as directed.  Yum.

I thought this was good, but my kids did not like it. I omitted dill & onion for family and used 2 cloves garlic, 1/4 tsp thyme and a yellow pepper instead of red. I lightly sauteed the broccoli, garlic, and pepper first as other reviewers suggested. Next time I will leave out the pepper, maybe the kids will like it better.

My boyfriend and I have a rating system for meals I cook as he is so hesitant to say if he liked something or not. He gave this a 7.5 out of 10. 

I changed some things to suit our tastes and the ingredients I had on hand. I didn't have any crescent rolls, but baked fresh Challah bread 2 days before and had some leftover dough so used that. Much better than canned rolls. I substitued spinach for broccoli and celery for the bell pepper. I cooked the celery, onion, and garlic in a little olive oil and then wilted the spinach into it. I used leftover blackened chicken and mixed in about 1/2 the mayo (I hate mayo! I put in just enough for some moisture) and added more cheese. The bread was fluffy and a little sweet, it was great and didn't take long at all. I like this because of the versatility of the stuffing, and now I always want to have bread dough sitting around - a great use for it!

Gave it 5 stars because it turned out great, but I did modify the recipe to suit what I had on hand.  I used BBQ'd chicken pieces with sauted green peppers, onions & garlic. Then used Ceasar dressing instead of the mayo & dill.  Forgot the almonds too, but it was really good anyway.  Oh, and I only had 1 pkg of crescent rolls, so halved the recipe and it was still plenty for the two of us and our mini picky-eaters.  Can't wait to make it again - it's a great base for all kinds of combinations.

This is definitely a keeper, and so easy to prepare the filling the night before and then just come home and bake it.  I did blanch the broccoli and saute the onion before combining the ingredients. Also, used a little ranch in place of some of the mayo. The top part of the crust did end up a little doughy when baked as directed.  Next time I will try just using one package of rolls and stretching it out as others suggested.  Overall, wonderful recipe!

Pretty good.  Made as written but added some mushrooms and green pepper instead of red.  Went with the suggestion of baking at 200 for 30 min and 15 min at 325 until it was golden on top.  Crust was perfect.  Will make again.

I would have given it 5 but the crescent rolls are so hard to work with they peel apart and I had to roll them together, I will use a pizza dough.  Other wise good kids liked it too.

This is absolutely wonderful!!!  I took some of the suggestions posted.  I cooked the broccoli al dente and sauted the onions, red bell peppers, and garlic together before mixing it all in a bowl.  As a new cook, the braiding instructions were a little confusing.  Thanks to the people who posted photos to explain it.  I would recommend this to ANYONE!

the best thing about this is the presentation. it really does look BEAUTIFUL, to present this at a party would knock everyones socks off! this was GREAT, i used mushrooms instead of bell peppers. i didnt use almonds or dill weed, i just seasoned it to my liking and it turned out great. the mayo can be cut down a lot..

Followed this recipe exactly directions-wise. I didn't put in bell pepper or almonds, but I used everything else as the recipe called for.  I was really confused when I went to unroll the two cans of crescent rolls, and they didn't fit on the pan... BUT here's what you need to do:
roll each can out so the long end is horizantal (and a little is draping off the baking pan). Then, when you cut the strips and braid it, ta-da, everything fits on the pan! I found that I had a little extra crescent dough (I really stretched it over the ingredients), so I made mini crescent rolls out of it. I only gave it 4-stars because I'm not a huge fan of dillweed, but my family loved it. Good enough to make again (maybe without the dill weed though... :)

My family loves this! I make mine by the directions but without onions and almonds and use about 1/2 tsp of dill. I like dill but the original amount is just too much in my opinion! It looks really nice out of the oven but takes a couple of times making it to get the braid right...or maybe it was just me :)

Very good recipe.  I decreased the dill to 1/2 tsp like suggested.  Next time I will increase it a little.  I steamed all the veggies before hand to slightly cook them before mixing with the chicken.  I also cooked it on a pizza pan with holes in the bottom to ensure it got cooked all the way.  I will definitely make this again!

I added carrots and sauted all veggies in olive oil before adding to the mixture and baking.  I put all veggies and cooked chicken through the food processer to make a mash.  I have very picky eaters.  My kids didn't even know they were eating veggies or chicken!

Very good!! Not too difficult to make.  Used garlic and butter crescent rolls, gave it extra flavor. Hubby says put this one in the keeper file and make again soon.

Made this last night for dinner. As some other reviewers suggested I have steamed broccoli and sautéed onions before mixing it all together. Thanks for someone's suggestion to cut braids after placing filling. This worked great. I was worried first how I will manage to braid it nicely, but after it is baked all imperfections disappear. What I did differently though is to bake it longer at a bit lower temperature - 180. It took about 45 minutes, but it did bake through beautifully and did not burn. Will be doing it again for sure.

I made this for a dinner guest and it was the first time she had ever visited our house. I was a little nervous trying a new recipe for a guest. I did saute the red bee ppper and garlic prior to cooking. It was easy and perfect! It was a beautiful presentation and a yummy dish. I was trying to think of sides to serve with it, but it had everything already in it. I will definitely serve this dish again and may try the herbs on top of the braid as others have suggested. Thanks for sharing!

I'm definitely not know as any kind of a cook but this turned out great.  I accidently added 2 tablespoons of dill instead of 2 teaspoons but we still couldn't taste much dill at all so I'd suggest trying more than the 2 teaspoons suggested.  I'll definitely make it again.

This is AWESOME! i did all the things that the other reviewers said, and reduced the dill weed and so on, man this is so good, but instead of doing the braid, afraid i would mess up, i cut the crescent rolls and made triangle ones. But if you are doing this then make sure to cover it up with foil fora little whiile then uncover and let the top golden. and make sure to slit it first. :)

This recipe won my high taste buds.  Every ingredients I followed came out just scrumptious meal!  I served with fresh green beans and salad.  The only thing I wished I had done was to spray the bottom of the baking pan with grease so that when serving it is easier to lift off the braid.  This is a keeper for my future recipe for sure.

This dish is DELISH!! My husband even said that we will have to make this again. I omitted the red pepper (just didn't have any on hand), and almonds (due to allergy), and it still turned out great. I also cooked the broccoli just a little to make it more tender. Just FYI, light mayo works just as well :o) Great recipe!!

This was like a chicken pie but in a braid.  We loved it!  I did omit the dillweed and almonds and added some cooked diced and chilled potatoes. I also made a chicken gravy to serve over it. It was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was so yummy!  I followed the recipe as written, except took other reviewers' advice and sauteed the onion and garlic, and steamed the broccoli before mixing with the chicken. Then I added some sesame seeds to the top before baking.  I didn't think the dill was overpowering at all.  The slivered almonds added a wonderful crunch.  I will definitely make this again!!

This was really good! The only thing I didn't add was the dill, as I didn't have any. I probably won't be putting broccoli in it next time for it seemed there were a LOT in the mix. Next time, I will try the mushrooms, and will be throwing some bacon in it too! Hubby "hates" mayo, but didn't even notice it. I mistakenly used the whole egg, but still came out wonderful. At first I was confused with the cutting, and the second roll of dough wasn't mentioned when it should. I figured it out, and was wrapped in a neat package..very tasty!

This was so good! My boyfriend and I loved it! I halved the recipe (since there was only 2 of us) and it still came out perfect! I didn't put any red pepper or almonds and I used Italian Seasoning instead of dill weed (not a big fan of dill weed). I will definitely be making this again!

This was pretty good, but didn't go over as well with the kids as I had hoped.  A little too dilly - seemed liked I could have cut the amount of dill in half.

Followed directions as written with the exception of the dill - I used ~1 tsp fresh dill.  All I could taste was the dill, the rest was fairly bland.

Absolutely fantastic. One thing though, the cresent roll explanations are difficult and incorrect. It is one can of Cresent Rolls used as a bottom. Then I put the chicken brocolli combo in the middle, pulled the ends and edges up. I used the second can of cresent rolls for the braiding by taking each seperate piece and intertwinning them. Kelly's Chicken and Broccoli Braid recipe is a 6 star winner, but there are only 5 stars to top it with.

Made this for dinner last night and everyone was raving about it! I had a little trouble with the dough as it was falling apart when i was making the braid but it turned out yummy! I used more chicken veggies cheese and mayo than it called for and had a dinner for 4 people with leftovers! I sauteed the veggies and chicken before putting it in the oven, def was moist and delicious! Will have to make this again!

This is so delicious!  I used 3/4 tsp dill and added a couple of tablespoons of ranch dressing.  I also squeesed a little lemon juice on the chicken mixture.  I ran out of crescent dough and still had a little chicken mixture left over so I ate it while the rest was baking and let me tell you it makes a wonderful chicken salad.  Even though I felt crescent dough challenged while putting it together, once it was baked it looked rather professional and only a little rustic.  I will be making this often.

We tried this with a couple of variations, we used smoked Gouda instead of cheddar & we used multigrain crescent dough. It turned out excellent!

Made this for dinner after work.  Quick and Easy!!  Kids and Husband loved it. I think it would have also made a very good casserole with Ritz crackers on top.  But the presentation of the cresent roll really made it look like I spent hours preparing. Also ended up being a great leftover...for BREAKFAST! :):)

Excellent ! The family loved it, and it was so easy to make.  After I took it out of the oven, I covered it in tin foil for 5 minutes to let the brocolli steam a little longer.

This was awesome.  I used homemade pizza crust instead of the crescent rolls, added the filling first then slit the crust and folded over.  Whole family loved it!!!!

As per many previous reviewers, I sauteed all veggies slightly before assembly.  I used ground chicken, which was easy and worked well.  I also used poultry seasoning on the chicken and only about half of the dill.  I know I added a bit more mayo than called for as the filling seemed on the dry side.  As far as flavor is concerned, this was good but not "wow".  If I make this again, I will use a nicely marinated chicken and some fresh herbs.  As far as presentation goes, this was beautiful and would be perfect for a buffet style dinner.

We really enjoyed this. My guy kept saying "wow this is so good" over and over while he was eating. I think it's a very adaptable meal (and the other reviews would imply this too.) I halved the recipe for the two of us, used just a couple of tablespoons of reduced fat mayo, and subbed pecans for the almonds and low fat crescent rolls. I used a yellow bell pepper because our market had some beautiful yellow ones and the red ones looked pretty sad, and a higher proportion of broccoli. 1 half of a chicken breast fed both of us, and it was really delicious. I used a bit less dill too.

Great recipe! I would have given this recipe 5 stars but i had to make some changes due to availability (cauliflower instead of broccoli, puff pastry instead of crescent rolls, and gouda instead of cheddar). Precooked the onions and peppers with the chicken as per other reviewer's suggestions. I will be making this again in the future; hopefully next time with broccoli!

Very good!  A bit too much dill, onion and mayo... and I LOVE dill.  I did not pre-cook my veggies, as many have suggested.  They had a little crispness to them - perfect!  The presentation was beautiful.  I will make this again.

Made this wonderful dish last evening and couldn't get enough.  The only adjustments I made to the recipe was to steam the broccoli slightly (2 minutes) and fry all the veggies until tender.  This definitely is a keep and would make a great show for company.

I really enjoyed this, even more so the next day.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not have any almonds.  I, too, could not be bothered to braid it, but that would make for presentation purposes in this house!  Kids both ate it, which is something in itself!!  Thanks for the post!!

DELICIOUS!!!  We loved this!  
1) Used "butter crescent" recipe - amazing.  Cook veggies a bit first, less mayo, more cheese.  Makes a LOT, but we gobble it up w/in a couple days.
2) Used a "Best Croissant" recipe online.  Wasn't like a croissant - but it WAS much lighter than the "butter crescent".  Great taste. 
*inside mixture: try adding some ranch???  Needs a bit more flavor*

This was very good and easy. However, just using 1 tsp of dill weed (half what is called for) was a little too much for me. Otherwise, yummy.

This was very good, but I had a hard time getting the dough cooked through (especially at the ends where there was a little bit extra dough from pinching the ends shut). My boyfriend raved over the taste though. The dill is absolutely necessary and it makes for a great smelling kitchen!

This is an awesome recipe, and has a very distinct flavor. I found that the amount of mayonnaise used can be changed if u don't want too much of that flavor.

Wonderful and beautiful! I left out the red bell pepper since my sister doesn't like it and used pecans instead of almonds. Delicious!

So easy and clean to make, i was suprised!  I used about 3 tablespoons of ranch dressing instead of mayo and no peppers.  i added chopped celery heart and carrots with the chopped broccoli and let them stew for a few minutes to get slightly soft in the broth made from cooking my chicken.  I was afraid one egg white wasn't going to be enough to cover the whole thing, but was surprised when I had a bunch left over.

We absolutely loved this. I added celery for some crunch. Next time I'll increase the broccoli and other veggies because I had some extra room. I used fat free mayo and reduced fat crescent rolls, and it turned out great. I also added some fresh basil that I had lying around, which was delicious.

Just tried this today - WONDERFUL!! TIPS: Definitely steam the broccoli before hand. Saute the onion in olive oil w/garlic too. And thanks to the reviewer on the tip to put the two cans of dough on top of one another, then roll out slightly with a rolling pin to flatten it. Tested it out on the in-laws -- even the picky father-in-law loved it!!

This is great made with cubed ham in place of the chicken, and orange bell pepper instead of red.  Really you can tweak the meat and vegetables to suit your own tastes.  I double the garlic, as well.

I have always loved this recipe since the first time I tried it at a Pampered Chef party. It is sooo tasty. I usually a little extra in the veggie department just to bulk it up and make it a little healthier. Also, I use the multigrain crescent roll dough - it adds a fuller, nuttier flavour to the braid.

This recipe was just so-so to me. I really should have followed the suggestions and used less dill weed. Way too overpowering! I added more almonds than called for just to use up the little bag of them I bought. Anyway, I probably won't be making this again.

Very good!  I didn't read any of the reviews until after I made it.  1 teaspoon of dill sounded like a lot, so I cut it back to about 3/4 teaspoon.  Next time I would probably cut it back a bit more.  I also used canned chicken.  I didn't feel like taking the time to thaw and cook a chicken breast.  I also left out the almonds as I am allergic.  I am going to try other combinations of fillings. I am thinking that taco meat or pizza fillings would also be great.

Very good! I only used half the dill called for, per other reviewers. Even that was a little strong for my taste, but other than that very good! There are an infinite number of possibilies with the stuffing!

Very good! I omited the almonds and dill due to personal taste preferences - but did everything else as is. The mixture of tastes was just right. We chopped everything small, which I think helped. The only thing I would try differently next time would be to add a bit more cheese. Very good recipe!

So so.  Followed recipe exactly.  The dill seemed a bit overpowering and I think 1 tsp would be more appropriate.  Almost makes it taste like a tuna dish.  Very lovely presentation. Probably won't make again.

Good recipe... I even made it once with biscuit dough.  I like it with extra cheese... maybe even some cream cheese.  I also tried it with leftover turkey meat.  Overall, it was a great recipe.  Oh yeah, it only took about 15 minutes to cook so keep an eye on it.

Made two for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. Most guests requested that I make them each their own braid next time. Used orange, red & yellow peppers instead of just red. Delicious!

Really good. I use dry minced onion instead of fresh, and add a few teaspoons more of mayonnaise; makes the chicken mixture creamier. Great for leftover chicken!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

This was really good. Used 1/2 the mayo to cut a few calories and grams of fat and added a little extra broccoli. Will definately be making again.

This was sooooo good.  We were disappointed because the dough didn't cook evenly in our oven, so the bottom middle was doughy.  Other than that it was delicious.

Quick, Easy, and Yummy!  I didn't have all the ingredients but I sure made it work! I left out the pepper, didn't have a garlic clove so I just used garlic powder and substituted 1/2 C Mozzarella cheese since I didn't have enough Cheddar. I'm not sure how much of a difference my changes really made but I will for sure make this again!

Outstanding and very versatile!  I added mushrooms along with green, red and yellow bell peppers.  This dish was a big hit during a New Year's Day party I went to.

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was beautiful and is not as difficult as it may seem. I used the "recipe creations" crescent sheets (they are a solid sheet instead of cut into triangles) and this made assembling the braid a lot eaiser. The leftovers were good for lunch the next day. I did use fresh dill instead of dried (probably 1/8 cup). Very tasty!

Pretty good very easy to make. We all liked it. I followed the recipe except the dill I added Mrs Dash (garlic and herb) flavor was ok. I just need to find a seasoning we like in this recipe will make again. The braid went together very easy.

I learned how to make this at a Pampered Chef party. I like to substitute spinach for the broccoli. I am not a good cook at all, but I love to make this and it's so good.

My Mother in law and I really enjoyed this!  My husband does not like broccoli so he said he was not eating this & he did!  He just picked it out.  He was tellng me what he wants me to do next time as he liked the cresent roll around it so much he'd like me to amke it into a pot pie of sorts.  So sounds like I will be making again with some changes to suite his taste.  I loved it though & thought it was great just the way it was!  This one's a keeper!

I love this stuff!  My sister in law makes it PERFECTLY, my food never seems to turn out just right:)
I did use "bigger" crescent rolls, that were like 10 oz a package, so maybe that made a difference, because it took FOREVER to get the dough cooked.  
I omitted the almonds and chopped everything in my little hand held chopper thing (you push the handle down and the blades rotate to chop everything very fine), well that worked great!  It made the entire filling like a paste almost and it held together so nicely and the texture was fabulous!

Had to use garlic powder b/c I didn't have fresh.  Also didn't use quite as much dill as called for.  Excellent, Excellent!  Rich and yummy!

OH MY this was great,husband wanted more (had 2 1/2 good size pieces w/home made chicken soup) I used green pepper (all I had on hand) NO DILL (used in other recipes and just way to over powering  I'm thinkin we just don't like it.) Used redused mayo and no almonds (didn't have on hand)& the braiding..... I so messed up, I did the cuts as the recipe called for but I did not do a braid(now I know) I put one side and then the next, need to angle the side cut pieces. I will practice on the braiding but this recipe is a keeper.  I will try this again and just work on the braiding hoping practice will make it perfect because the flavor is sooo worth it!!!

Very delicious. I made it exactly as written, and it was PERFECT! Great dish for a potluck! Also, if you double the ingredients for the filling and add some cranberries, it makes an AMAZING chicken salad! Pair that with the Peppy's Pita Bread from this website- delicious!!!

Great dish and presentation.  I had way too much filling left over tho - but I don't measure usually so maybe I was just too generous.  Next time I would add a bit more cheese and back off on the dill.  Will make this lots I'm sure.

Wow....what a great idea. My boyfriend and I made this together one night. We had so much fun doing it together (we had a little trouble figuring out the braid part, so we had to get creative) and enjoyed the leftovers a couple days later.

had some extra broccoli that needed to be used and i'm not a fan of it just as a side dish. I too made this as a ring with only one package of crescent rolls rather than 2 as I only needed enough to feed 2. I made 2 chicken breasts marinated in balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, some italian seasoning, garlic clove, and dill.  I cooked the chicken in the grill pan then let it cool a bit and chopped.  I used about 1 c. broccoli, about 1/2 c. red pepper (love red pepper) and some scallions (both ends, and cheddar and mixed it all together.  Used the egg white brush on top and then put some sliced almonds around. Even after assembly I had to refrigerate it, popped it into the oven at 375 before it was preheated and it was done in about 20 minutes.  easy, different idea...

This is so yummy! We used light mayo because that's all we had, and then added about 1/4 cup more cheese. The dill and almonds compliment the dish well.  The dough wasn't completely done so I would suggest cooking it for a little bit longer at a slightly lower temp. I will make this again without a doubt!

Really good!  Living in the UK, refrigerated dough is pretty hard to come by so I used a 500g pack of ready made shortcrust pastry.  I sauted the onion, garlic, pepper and broccoli for 3-4 mins to give them a head start.  I tried the braid but it was beyond me so I ended up making one large pasty type thing. I used milk to glaze the pastry instead of egg.  Baked for about 50mins at 200C.  Next time - I will double the filling and I will make sure I roll the pastry literally paper thin.  This time round it was too much pastry and not enough filling.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  The only thing I did different than the recipe was I lightly steamed the broccoli and sauteed the pepper, onion and garlic before adding to the mixture.  I also made the mixture a day ahead and it was delicious!  I didn't serve it with anything, but I think tomato soup would be yummy with it.  Will try that with left overs.

Yum!  I used Reduced Fat cresent rolls - the regular ones are too heavy for me.  I left out the peppers and almonds because my husband is not a fan.  I used garlic powder and onion flakes instead of the "real thing".  I also added celery but next time I will leave that out.  I added black olives and those were a VERY yummy addition.  I used a Monterey Jack/Colby cheese blend...a GREAT recipe - and it looked pretty, too, despite my picture.  My husband was impressed!

I made this for a Bunco party and everyone loved it.  I do suggest that you bake it at 350 for a few minutes longer so the center can bake all the way,

I Loved This Recipe.  I will serve this many times over.

I chose to make this with less ingrd because we are picky eaters.  We used the onion, garlic, chicken, broccoli, cheese and mayo.  Leaving out the spices.  This was EASY and YUMMY!!!

It tasted really good and my family gobbled it up.  However I only gave it four stars because it was kind of a pain to make and I ended up making pockets more that a braid.

Good, I did use half mayo and half ranch dressing, because I didn't want a strong mayo taste. Also added a little Gluden's spicy mustard for flavor. Very Good. Easier to put together than I thought it would be!

We didn't really care for this one...  Liked the broccoli and chicken combo but the mayo just wasn't right for us.  Might try again with flavored cream cheese instead.  Liked the concept though!  Nice presentation too.  I had never used the croissants in a can but they worked out fine.  I did use a rolling pin to seal them all together and the braid was pretty easy.  Thanks for the concept...  Will maybe try with different ingredients.

I only had a sheet of puff pastry on hand, so used that and it turned out great!  I had some cauliflower, so I put some of that in.  My husband loved this!

I brought this to a Christmas party and it was gone before anything else they served.  People even "oohed" and "aahed" when I took it out of the oven because it was so pretty!.  My 3 and 5 year olds loved it too.  When I combined the crescent rolls the dough was too long to fit on my baking sheet.  The next time I made it, I just kept them separate and had to loaves instead of one long one.  It was a little 'mayonnais-y" - next time I might use less mayonnaise and/or add some sour cream.  Nice recipe!

Brought this to a party and everyone ate it right up. It was more difficult than I thought to put together, but cooked up beautifully and tasted great. Making it again for a progressive dinner for 70! Thanks for posting.

This is an exceptional recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I added some sour cream and extra garlic. I think next time I might saute the vegetables ahead of time beacause they were a little under done. I wonder how seafood would do in this recipe instead of chicken. Has anyone tried it? Thanks for the recipe. It was delicious!!!!!!!

This recipe was great! The appearance of the braided bread looked really nice, I didn't want to cut it up! I didn't use any dill based on other reviews, and used sour cream in place of the mayo (I hate mayonaisse) Would definately recommend this and will be making it again!

Made this "appetizer" for a football crowd. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I didn't use the almonds since I am not a fan of them, and I used a frozen bread dough loaf instead of the crescent rolls and rolled it like a jelly roll. Baked the bread loaf according to the package directions! It was fabulous! Will make this one again!

This was okay. My husband did not care for it at all--in fact, he asked to NOT  make it again. 

I did alter it a bit, though due to not having all the ingredients as called for. Didn't have any red bell pepper, so I substituted roasted peppers, used dehydrated garlic (Garlic, garlic from Tastefully Simple).  I also didn't have slivered almonds, but used sliced, salted almonds. I didn't like that almonds in it at all.  I should have also not used as much dill as others had suggested.  

The next day's leftovers were much better though!! It seems that if I were to make it when DH is not home for dinner, it's best to let the filling sit and marry the flavors over night. It's not bad for using left over chicken.... something different other than chicken salad.

This was super!  I did only put in half the amount of the dill as other reviewers stated.  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil and fresh garlic to give the chicken some flavor.  I think the next time I make it I will make 1/2 as much as it is only DH and me and this isn't as good when it is leftover.

This is a great recipe that qualifies as comfort food. I have made this recipe a lot and use thawed pre-cooked Tyson chicken fajita strips to cut down on time. I have also left filling mixture to sit over night and the flavors combine really nicely. Either way if you make it immediately or let it sit overnight this recipe is wonderful!

Good things: yes, it was fairly easy and a great way to use up broccoli stalks once the "pretty tops" are gone.  Yes, it looks very fancy and is amazingly easy to get it to look that way!  However, the taste was a bit flat.  Maybe I should have put all 2 tsp of dill in -- I didn't based on other reviews.  Maybe I should have used crescent roll dough -- all the butter and salt in it makes anything yummy, but I didn't have any on hand (and homemade dough does not taste as good).  I may try it again and put more oomph into the filling.  I liked that it wasn't overly cheesy though.

This is very easy to make, and is very pretty in the end.  I think I might use mushrooms instead of broccoli next time, and I omitted the red pepper as we are not pepper fans n this house.

Liked the almond part. I had substituted potatoes for chicken as I am vegetarian. Tasted like the famous 'upper Michigan pasti' Filling overall.

I made a homemade crescent dough for the crust rather than store bought, I decreased the dill as suggested in previous reviews, and substituted onion powder (approx 1/2 tbsp) in place of the fresh onion. I also omitted the peppers since my family can not eat them.  This recipe was a real winner!

We made this recipe after reading the reviews so we decreased the dill by half and doubled the salt. It turned out amazingly!! One of the best recipes I have ever gotten off this site. I will deffinatly make it many times again.

I gave this three stars because I think it would be good without the dill. I only used 1/2 teaspoon of dill and I thought that was too much of a dill taste.....I'm glad I didn't use the two teaspoons. BUT I think I will try it again and just leave out the dill all together.

This recipe was pretty easy to whip up and looked nice as well.  We both enjoyed it but thought it needed just a tad less dill weed.  Both of us like it but it was a little overpowering.  Made as written except I didn't have any almonds so I just made it without and it was still good.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I loved this! I was a little weirded out when making the filling because I thought it smelled like potato salad but none of that came through once it was fully baked. Next time I'll go a little easier on the dill but not by much. I followed some other reviewers methods and made two braids rather than one big one, and I also sprinkled the almonds on top. My bf & his friend weren't crazy about the crunchiness of the almonds in this but I thought it was great! This one can go into our regular rotation- thanks for the great recipe!

Really fast and easy to prep, and family loved it!  Also, many variations can be created.

I make this all the time, it is very good. The only thing I do different is after I brush it with the egg wash, I put the sliced almonds on top. They toast up and are wonderful! Also helps to chop your broccoli very small to ensure that it cooks well.

This was really good!   I followed others advice and sauteed the  veggies before adding them to the mixture.  I also left out the almonds since I did not have any.  Other then that i followed exactly as stated and it was great.  I used butter garlic flavored crescents and it was fantastic.

I made this for dinner last night and everyone in my house loved it....my six year old and two  year old had second helpings (which is unheard of).  They actually asked me to make it again tonight (and I did because I loved it too). I will be making this again and again!
Let's see.....what did I do differntly?
I cooked the chicken in balsamic vinagrette, I sauteed the veggies for about 5 min and I didn't add the almonds.  The only thing I had a problem with was the cooking time.  I had to take it out after about 15 min because it would have burned otherwise.  So the filling was not as hot as it should have been.

This recipe is a little too involved for my skill level, so be forewarned -- it takes a little patience and skill to use crescent roll dough to create a single sheet.  The filling is delicious, though!  The assembly of the final product is too complicated (and that's why I'm giving it two stars.)

My daughter made this for me and it was delicious. The almonds in it taste so good. The braid didn't stay completely braided but probably with practice it will come out staying perfectly braided.

I loved this recipe! It was really light to eat. I combined the ingredients into just one cresent roll/ and used sour cream instead of the maynoise.

This recipe is great ! Sometimes I will just mix all the ingredients together, substitute cream cheese for the mayo and add to rice instead of the crecent rolls ! My father in law loves this dish and I plan on taking it to our PTO potluck this week !

Beautiful presentation! But I was disappointed in the flavor, so I gave it four stars. I expected it to taste awesome with a five star rating, but I thought it was bland even with all the dill. I think next time I'll try the cream of mushroom soup suggestion instead of mayo and maybe saute the veggies - that sounds good. If I can just crank up the flavor a notch, I'll give it five stars!! Thanks for the recipe!

This just didn't suit my family's tastes.  I love dill, so I used the full amount, but it was too much.  Even without the dill, though, I doubt we would have liked it much better.  I won't be making it again.

Amazing!  I wish I could give it more stars!  I didn't add the dill only because I don't like the taste and smell of dill.  Also, I used a Cheddar cheese/ monterrey jack blend from Sargento which was delicious.  I love mushrooms so next time I'll add a few of those!

This was great. I omitted the dill and used frozen broccoli. It seemed like too much filling for the braid so I just used one can on bottom and one on top with slits for steam. Also, I used almost 2 cups of shredded cheddar cause we love cheese. I think this would be really good with velveeta and I'm going to try that next time.

I didn't understand how to do the braid, so combining the mixture with the dough was a disaster for me.  However, the concoction was rather tasty.  Not sure I would try to do the braid again.

This is my favorite Pampered Chef recipe. It's been around for years and is always a hit. Try sprinkling a few slivered almonds on top for the last 10 minutes of baking... they add a little extra crunch and look pretty.

i would give it a 5 for taste. i love dill and it went perfectly with the chicken and broccoli. i didnt have any almonds but it still was good. only setback is the braid. i understood the directions but i couldnt get the pieces to stay together. i wasnt too pretty, but no filling came out. although it tasted great i will give it 4 stars bc of the preparation.

I would give this recipe 6 stars if I could.  I finally found something my picky guy raved about!  I can't eat it, (no cheese for me) but tried a bite and it was delicious.  
I didn't even add the red pepper, onion, or dill weed and it was still awesome.  I added more cheddar cheese, though.  It was very pleasing to look at and super easy.  Thanks, this was awesome!

This tastes WONDERFUL and is so pretty - people will definitely be impressed if you make this for them!  I tried it out on a few friends during a football playoff game gathering and it was such a hit that I made it again for our Superbowl party.  We really like garlic, so I added 6 cloves of garlic instead of just one.  I also added a cheddar / monterey jack cheese mix instead of just the plain cheddar.  I used lower fat crescent roll dough and it turned out fine.  I will be making this again frequently in the future!

This is a wonderful recipe to impress people with. I would only serve 5 with each braid. You can easily double this recipe and make enough for 10 people. It is such a wonderful blend of flavors that people will definately ask you for the recipe. The only thing I didn't like was how it reheats. Make sure you eat it all while it's fresh.

People always think I am a wonderful cook with this easy yet extremely tasteful recipe.  I leave out the pepper and the almonds and add a little extra cheese.

I made this for NYE 2004, and prepared the chicken mixture the night before.  We didn't have any appetite for it until New Years Day, and it held up great.  It's delicious and it's fast.  Will be making this again and again.

I made this one before since it was a pampered chef recipe. I added the silvered almonds along the top of the braid after I brushed the egg white on. This was a great recipe!

I just wanted to say that this was a quick easy tasty recipe.  It looks great and tastes great.. I omitted the Dill Weed and subsituted Garlic Pepper. Also I sprinkled some remaining cheese across the top. ( I do understand some of the confusion that people are facing when trying to understand how to construct the braid.. I wish that there was a way to take a photo of the layout and post it with the recipe) The acid test for this recipe was my father's reaction, he LOATHES broccoli and usually refuses to eat ANY dish containing it.  He came back for seconds!!  Thank you so  much and I will recommend it often!

Very yummy, everyone loved it. I cooked boneless chicken thighs (4 small ones) in olive oil, then roughly cut up. I used a whole head of broccoli, 4 shallots (because they're milder than regular onions), one red bell pepper and fresh rosemary and thyme (instead of dill weed). Everything else I left the same; you can see it's a little different than the original recipe, but that's the beauty- I assume you can make it with whatever you want and it'll still be so good!

Next time, I think I'll use the Pilsbury rectangular pizza dough because I had a hard time cutting up, folding and braiding the crescents- they just wouldn't stay together nicely. So, it'll make for a less flakey exterior but will probably look prettier.

The mixture inside was great.  I did reduce the amount of mayo in half, a 1/2 tsp less on the dill, yellow pepper, and no salt or almond.  
The cresent rolls did not thrill me.  It was too doughy.  I did buy the Reduced fat version.
Next time I will use pizza dough instead.

We thought this recipe was great.  I didn't think that the recipe explained very well how to do the braid though.  We ended up making up our own way.

This is a fun recipe to try, especially if you want to do something a little impressive. I made it for brunch and got lots of compliments, both on appearance and taste. I made a few minor alterations - I sauteed the veggies in butter beforehand, included 2 tablespoons of mustard in the mixture, and topped the finished product with butter flavored cooking spray (instead of egg) and sesame seeds. I can see this is a very versatile recipe - you could change up the ingredients in all kinds of ways!

I know that I've rated this one before but thought I'd give another 2 cents worth...sometimes when I've served this to other people they've remarked that the bread was somewhat sweet so to curb that I now use the refrigerated Pillsbury pizza dough (found near the crescent rolls) and it blends much better with the other flavors, no more sweetness.  It's a lot more forgiving when braiding and just an overall better taste.

We use Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  It seemed a little too strong on that flavor.  Overall good, though.  We will try it again with less mayo/Miracle Whip.

This is a fun recipe. You have to make it quickly though because the dough gets too soft and begins to fall apart when assembled. To make it more kid-friendly for my son's birthday party, I made it with pizza sauce, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese instead of the chicken and broccoli. Yum! It was the first thing to disappear at the party.

I'm giving this 3 stars as the filling was pretty good but my husband thought there was way too much bread.  He's a whole wheat kind of guy & commented that the cooked dough had a litle bit of a sweet taste which he didn't like as well.

This was actually much easier to make than I thought it would be and it actually turned out looking like a braid!  I left out the nuts and forgot to do the eggwash but it still turned out really well.  I think the cresents have enough butter in them that they brown fine without the eggwash.  I made it for an app but was also good for lunch the next day.  Thanks.

This is an excellent recipe, I added more garlic, cause I like it that way, and instead of the braid, put another sheet of crescent roll dough on top of the filling.  When the cover was on, I put about 3 inch slits along the perforations to let steam out and did the egg wash.  When it was done I cut the portions using the slits as a guide, it made a very nice presentation, and I got mucho praise for the meal!!

I took leftovers to work for lunch and everyone wanted the recipe. Beautiful appearance and very tasty. I'm sure you could substitute chicken with salmon or make it vegetarian. Very versatile. I left off the egg wash and it was nice and brown in 20 minutes.

This can be served as an appetizer or main dish. Just serve larger portions with a garden salad.

Very tasty and easy.

Impressive to look at, and a really good combination of textures and flavors in the filling.  Don't skip the slivered almonds.

This recipie tasted as good as it looked.  I can't wait to take it to a pot luck at work.  When you cut into it there were all these beautiful colors in the "stuffing".  And the combination tasted wonderful.  Thanks for the recipie!
