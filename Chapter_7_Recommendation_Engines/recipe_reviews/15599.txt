Oddly, our family also calls this dish "Funeral Potatoes" and that's the title I used to search for this. As others have mentioned, I too use the cubed hash browns (or the O'Brien kind); I use shredded cheese (of the cheddar variety) and one can of soup - cream of chicken.  I also use corn flakes instead of bread crumbs. Also, I add about 1/2 of an onion, diced.  Awesome!  A great compliment to ham. I always make this for Easter.  Good for potlucks too!

Funeral potatoes are yummy, one of my fav dishes. however, this particular recipe is bland and runny.  Yes, I made exactly to the recipe.  I won't use this recipe again, and advise anyone looking for funeral potatoes, to keep looking.

I've made a recipe like this with just a few changes.  Instead of using celery and mushroom soup I use two cans of cream of chicken, and use shredded cheese instead of process cheese.  I also use crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs, and ad green onions. Very good.

My family has been making a version of this dish for years and years, it was a neighborhood staple and IS called funeral potatoes bcs it is served after funerals to the family.    The way we make it though: Use shredded cheese, not cheese sauce No butter No water These changes will make the dish not soupy.  Every person in the neighborhood had their own style to making it; add bacon or ham chunks, green onions, a "flake" type cereal for a crusty top, or a touch of cayenne pepper will give it a kick

The casserole is very soupy and was not a very big hit for Christmas lunch.  The processed cheese spread overpowers the recipe.  I would not serve this again.

After our company downsized, I hosted a wake party for the dearly departed and thought this would be a fun dish to serve. I thought the sauce and topping were about twice what you would need for 2 pounds of potatoes, so I added another half of a bag of potatoes. It looked great with its lightly browned bread crumb topping, but only about 3 people besides me dared to eat it. Maybe they just weren't hungry. My advice is to decrease the sauce and topping ingredients rather than increase the potatoes, because it makes a huge amount. With all the processed ingredients, it will probably never spoil, but I decided to throw it away after a week as one serving was enough for me. I think I'll try a funeral pie next time.

I make this recipe often, but in mine I add two cups of shredded sharp cheddar. Instead of water I add a half soup can of milk. And instead of bread crumbs, crushed corn flakes. Much tastier! Sometimes I add ham and bell peppers too.

Zippity do da! This is great BUT YOU NEED MORE HASHBROWNS!!! I made this twice in less than a week.  The first time, I used those "Southern Hashbrowns" (they're square) and a 4lb bag of them!! (I know!! 4lbs!!) but followed the recipe to the letter - except I just added the amt of breadcrumbs I felt "looked right." I was feeding a crowd that night and I didn't have ANY LEFT! But I made them a second time, (again, using the 4lb bag of square hashbrowns) but this time, I used a 15.5oz jar of cheese chili con carne. This type of mexican cheese gave them a zippy kick. We loved it this way too (almost better!!). Yes it makes a lot (we had leftovers) BUT I can't figure out how you can halve the sauce portion w/out wasting some of the "cream of..." soups! With the changes I made, this was awesome and loved by everyone! Thanks nancy!

I really found this easy. I think it needed more potatoes though. I also used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and it was great with the change. The bread crumbs didn't brown the first time around so I sprayed them with olive oil spray and they browned up great.

Just awesome.  I made this for Christmas dinner yesterday and everyone raved.  After reading all the reviews I decided I was going to half the liquid.  I halved all the liquid ingredients except for the butter and it was to die for.  I will be making this very often!!!

Only 4 stars b/c I didn't follow it exactly.  I took the advice of others and cut the sauce back.  I just used one can of cream of chicken instead of the other 2 soups.  Also, half the butter and a little less water.  After that, it turned it really good.  I didn't feel it was too soupy at all.

These were o.k. but the kids didn't like them at all.  I took others' recommendations of only using 1/2 of the cheese sauce mixture - glad I did.  I also only put about 1/2 of the bread crumbs on and it still seemed like too many.  We had lots of leftovers.

This is a very good recipe.  I make it fairly often.  Only when I make it, I omit the water and the cream of mushroom soup, and I add about a cup of grated cheddar cheese in with the mixture.  It makes it less soupy.  I have used the cream of cheddar cheese soup too instead of the processed cheese and it turns out delicious.  My family and I love it.

This dish is called funeral potatoes because the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (mormons) would traditionally make these as a casserole amongst other things for a family after a funeral so the family has one less thing to worry about. The potatoes are so good that now every LDS get together HAS to have these potatoes. Made this recipe and it tastes just like grandma made

Everyone absolutely loves these. We have 5 kids who ask for these on a regular basis. It's easy. If there's any leftovers they keep well. I cut the breadcrumbs down to half. 
Highly recommend this!

I have had funeral potatos before...these potatos usually show up in meal care packages such as when my grandaddy was seriously ill or as the name says when some has passed and there is funeral...their very easy on the stomach which makes them a go to for sudden passings and passings after a long illness

I was surprised to find this recipe faceless!!  We love funeral potatoes.  This recipe was a bit different than what we are used to.  I am giving it four stars only because the kids really loved it.  I sub'd "cream of chicken and mushroom" instead of "cream of celery" and "cream of mushroom", and milk for the water.  Also, I only used half the jarred cheese (I really almost replaced this entirely) and added 1.5 c of shredded sharp cheddar.  I have to say, I was really surprised how much the kids loved this recipe -- when they go back for seconds and thirds...well, you know it's good.

Funeral Potatoes, or as we call them, Happy Potatoes because they are so creamy and delicious, should not be made with hash browns.  They don't hold up in the oven and turn to mush.  You should use diced potatoes or frozen diced potatoes.  Condensed cream of chicken, or mushroom soup, cheddar or peperjack cheese, (not cheese product)!, and can be changed up to fit any familys taste, ie: bacon, green onion, asparagus, ham.  
This is a wonderfuly filling dish and is always a hit at partys.
