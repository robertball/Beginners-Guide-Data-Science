I had a little twist. I used a cup of Coconut milk instead of the plain milk. I also added the zest from the Lemon, but I ALWAYS add more lemon to ANY Lemon recipe because "LEMON" is my favorite flavor. Ever since I was a child I can peel them & eat them like Oranges. No such thing as too lemony for me. After everyone has stopped puckering, I would admit that I don't recommend this "Lemon-Juicing" for everyone.
