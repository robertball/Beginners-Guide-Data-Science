I finally found a peanut butter fudge that sets up!!  If you don't have a thermometer, just boil (med-low heat) for 6 minutes after boiling begins.
Also, 4 large marshmallows = 1 ounce.  Cheaper than creme and works great !!

I have this recipe except it calls for 1 jar of peanut butter(18 ounces) and it is really good fudge. So easy to make. My advice is to have the baking dish lined with waxed paper or foil ready and have the marshmallow fluff, peanut butter and vanilla in the bowl so when you remove the milk/sugar mixture from the heat, you can just dump the fluff/peanut butter in the pan and get right to mixing it up quickly. You got to work fast and trying to scoop the fluff out of the jar is too time consuming.

I've never made fudge before but this recipe is so easy to do. DEBRAPRICE gave great advice about the temperature:  "If you don't have a thermometer, just boil (med-low heat) for 6 minutes after boiling begins."  The fudge turned out wonderful. I am definitely going to be using this recipe again!  Edited to add: I have made this fudge many more times and just wanted to add a couple more things. I butter the pan and then place wax paper in it to make for easier cleanup. Also it is easier to get the fudge out. I have found that if I boil the mixture for 10 minutes it turns out a little more firm, just how my family loves it. Thanks again!  Update (2/4/09): I bought a silicone pan and it has been a lifesaver! No more fussing with wax paper or greasing a pan. All you have to do is dump the fudge in the silicone pan (placed on a baking sheet for structure) and pop it in the fridge. It sets up perfectly. Once you're ready to cut it all you do is turn the silicone pan upside down and the big "block" of fudge easily comes out on it's own. It's so much easier this way, plus the fudge doesn't get mangled at all while cutting!

This is a fabulous recipe.  Tip:  It took between 10-15 minutes on medium heat (about 10 of those were "rolling boil" minutes) before it reached the ball-forming stage (aka time to add the marshmallow and peanut butter).  It set fast too; It looked like fudge by the time it was in the pan.  :)  I sprinkled chocolate chips over half the fudge as it cooled; They melt a bit but that makes it easier to cut the squares later.  'The only PB Fudge recipe I'll make from now on.

I don't know why but this recipe would not work for me and I really wanted it to. Determined, I attempted it 3 times.  My first attempt I used the candy thermometer, removing it from the heat once the temperature reached soft ball stage.  It never set up.  The second time, I tried letting it boil for a full six minutes as was suggested by another reviewer. It never set up. I blamed the weather, it was rainy and unseasonably humid on the day I attempted it and have read this can definitely have an effect on fudge setting up.  My 3rd attempt, the weather was dry and cold. I let the mixture boil for a full 8 minutes this time. It never set up.  All 3 attempts ended up as a sugary sludge that found its way down my garbage disposal.  My 4th attempt was another recipe that turned out perfectly on the first attempt. I really wanted this recipe to work. I have no idea what went wrong but one thing that I do know for sure is that I will never attempt this recipe again.

This is good peanut better fudge-but MAKE SURE you reach atlease 240-slowly. My first batch was like caramel, and I cooked to 240, so the next batch I went up to 245- much better, but still does not get "hard" like I like my fudge. I used marshmallows as well- 28 reg sized.

This was the first time I ever made fudge & it came out delicious!  I didn't have
a thermometer so I burned it, but poured the hot mixture through a metal strainer
& then poured it in the pan, it was perfect.  Not too sugary, peanut butter is the
predominant flavor.  I did substitute half of the white sugar with brown sugar & 
used large marshmallows instead of marshmallow creme.  I got a candy 
thermometer now & will definitely make this again!  In fact, I think I will make some 
right now!

I followed directions TO THE LETTER! at 224 degrees, the pan started to boil OVER! The finished product was a VERY GOOD TASTING peanut butter SLUDGE! If someone could tell me what I did wrong, I'd be VERY GRATEFUL.

Awesome!! The last time I tried to make fudge it was a a HUGE failure.  A friend of mine was visiting and said they wanted some peanut butter fudge and here I ended up.    I was nervous through the whole process and found that being patient is key to being successful with fudge.  This was a clear recipe to read and worked out perfectly!!  My friend ate a piece before we called it a night and said it was A+ that i should sell it!! Thank you for sharing!

This is the best peanut butter fudge recipe I have ever made!  But, I don't agree with the opinions or directions of some of the other people who said to just let it boil for 6 minutes(if you don't have a candy thermometer)!  It takes at least 15-20 minutes to get it to the soft-ball stage!!

Love this recipe! I have never been able to make fudge my entire life until I tried this recipe. My fudge would never harden...it was always like caramel. This recipe turned out perfect the first time I made it. I didn't have a candy thermometer so I let it boil for 10 minutes as suggested in another review. I put 12 big marshmallows since I didn't have marshmallow creme. It turned out PERFECT. So nice and creamy. My family was so happy! After trying for 20+ years...they were finally glad to get some fudge!

I made this recipe for the first time this last holiday season by special request from someone who doesn't eat chocolate fudge. I have made a lot of fudge before, but this was my first time making peanut butter fudge. To start off I would recommend heating the milk and butter first, then stirring the sugar in gradually. I did only a few things different, one completely by mistake. I used a can of sweetened condensed milk (grabbed the wrong can at the store), and 1/3 [12 oz] can of evaporated milk (approximately, it was what I had remaining from a previous batch of fudge). The condensed milk added a sweeter taste, and the evaporated milk thinned it out a little bit. Also instead of using marshmallow creme, I melted my own marshmallows in a heavy saucepan. The fudge came out great, and I have gotten rave reviews from everyone who has eaten it.

I've been making fudge for over 30 years so I'm not exactly new at it.  My first batch of this turned out good, a little grainy and not hard, but firm enough to eat and  tastes like the inside of a Reeses cup.  Huge hit.  It was VERY difficult to get to the soft ball stage, either by cold water test or thermometer. I did both.  I also make allowances for altitude.    The second batch flopped.  I could not get it above 225.    I think the proportions on this are wrong.  If you compare to a similar chocolate marshmallow creme fudge there is twice as much milk and more sugar.  My next attempt I will adjust both of those.

I made this for my brother-in-law - I don't even LIKE peaunut butter, but wow this is good. Even though I tried to make it as written, my 12 oz. evaporated milk turned out to be only 5 oz., so I added a cup of half and half (actually, 21 of the Coffee Mate's single serves...it's all I had!) to make up the difference. And I only had creamy, not chunky, peanut butter. Followed it exact, other than that. Well... I did melt a cup of dark chocolate chips and iced the top after it had cooled. :D It set up quickly and when it was ready was so creamy and good... Definitely a keeper!

the people who gave this a bad review need their heads examined! i have never attempted fudge before and this recipe worked perfect!! i used reeses peanut butter and have been told that it was the best fudge anyone has ever had. it was smooth and creamy. it was soft but in a good way. it just melts in your mouth!! i am now using this as a base for all my fudge. instead of peanut butter, i have used 1lb of white chocolate and some oreos and made cookies and cream fudge. absolutely awesome!!! definitely a keeper!

This is AWESOME Peanut butter fudge. When I first made it, I made sure to cook it to the right temp, but was a little worried when it seemed so "soft." However, within minutes after pouring it in the pan it was solidifying. After a good two hours or so in the frig, it was ready to go.

My husband is going to give this as gifts to his coworkers. I'm sure they'll be on a butter and sugar high aftewards--it is really RICH :).  I'd recommend keeping it refrigerated though.

This is my go-to recipe for peanut butter fudge. I like to use creamy peanut butter and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I would say that a candy thermometer is necessary for success though. I tried the recipe without one after reading reviews of how long to boil to get to that soft ball stage. I boiled it for 8-9 minutes and it didn't set up. After I purchased a candy thermometer, I tried it again and ended up having to boil it for about 15 minutes. Bottom line is every stovetop is different and your going to have a better result using a candy thermometer.

I made this fudge last night. It boiled over at 230 degrees, it turned out to be a soft blobby mess! but, the taste was very very good! probably because of the CUP of butter! which consequently is probably the same reason it failed.

I wish I would have read the reviews first and saved myself the time & effort. I had no luck with this recipe.  What a waste!  I definitely won't be using this recipe again.  I followed directions exactly and it was grainy & too soft.

I'm not a fan of peanut butter fudge at all and this stuff was great!!  I have never made fudge before so it was kinda like a frosting consistency, but the taste was delicious!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was definitely a hit.  Next time I will cook it a couple minuutes longer so it will set better.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good, but make sure you cut up servings in small pieces as this is VERY rich and sweet.

I cooked this fudge to 24O degree.I cooked it not long enough.It was too soft.I cut them after they cooled.Then I placed about 6 at a time in a corning wear white dish in the microwave to cook longer.I cooked 5 mins more.Stirring after each min.Stir alittle after you remove from microwave.Pour on a buttered plate.This will help it get harder.It will look like a peanut butter color.Taste better.

Made to spec, used a candy thermometer, and the recipe WOULD NOT SET. Resulted in an gooey mess.  Also, too sweet for my tastes.

I wish I had read the reviews first, especially since mine turned out like soup.  I have made all kinds of fudge and use a thermometer and they all come out perfect. I removed the fudge from the heat when the temperature reached 240...nowhere did the recipe say to boil for 6 minutes.  I have never been successful with PB fudge and still need a good recipe if anyone has one.

Good flavor but it didn't set up.I checked it with a digital thermometer but didn"t do the soft ball test in water. The water test might be the more reliable way to test the fudges doneness.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I follow it to the T and it always comes out great.  I always use a candy thermometer, a 3 quart pan, etc.  It does take quite a while boiling at medium heat to get to 240.  I stir it all the time because I find if the it doesn't stay agitated it will burn on the bottom. Once it gets to 240, I pour it into a bowl where I already have the peanut butter and the fluff (I think next time I'll try the marshmallows instead of the cream like others have suggested).  I have never had it not set up and the compliments are beyond great!  Everyone loves it and my kids ask for it every Christmas.

This recipe is very easy and comes out very smooth.  Will definitely need to have a good candy thermometer and go for 240 degrees.  As someone else said, it takes 15-20 minutes to get there and use the water test to make sure it's at the right stage.  I use Jif peanut butter for making this as it's a little less oily than some other brands.   I would also recommend you test out your thermometer in some hot or boiling water before making candy.  A lot of the cheaper ones seem to be good for a few uses and then no longer register accurately.

So, I just finished making this, I don't know yet if it set up or not, but I had a problem with getting it to reach it's temp. For some reason it just stopped getting warmer around 100* C. I was rather confused about why this was. I had it on medium and it stayed at 100 for 15-20 min. and I finally gave up and mixed everything together.. I figured if i kept cooking it it would just get all crystally.

I think the flavor should be more of peanut butter,so I will cut the butter in half and add half more peanut butter. My first attempt so I use the dish,but i had a little left in the pan and I put it on waxed paper,it was a thinner layer and that set beautiful. So in my next attempt I will use a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper.

I guess I did something wrong because I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was way to soft for me.  The flavor was good though.  I had to keep it in the freezer to keep it from melting in your hands while you were eating it.  I had made a differant recipe for chocolate fudge just before I made this and it turned out great so I am not sure what happened.

It is very likely that my lack of success in attempting to make this yummy-sounding fudge is due to my lack of fudge experience, but I had the same sludgy, grainy slop after boiling.  I may try again, since I hear that fudge can be tough to get right!

The PB flavor wasn't enough, too much white sugar, and not creamy. I found another recipe on here that I liked MUCH better using brown sugar instead. Keep searching. . .

Did you forget the salt and vanilla in the recipe? I've never before seen a fudge recipe without a touch of salt and a splash of vanilla. [I added both, and the fudge turned out WONDERFUL!]

I LOVE this recipe!! I followed the ingredient list exactly except I used smooth peanut butter instead of creamy and used a cup and a half of it. The cooking direction I rolled to a tee, except I boiled sugar mixture for 6 minutes and stirred almost constantly. The taste and texture of the finished product is truly awesome!! BTW, it set up for me perfectly!!

Wow, this fudge is fantastic.  Tastes like the inside of a peanut butter cup but creamier.  Better than the chocolate fudge, in my opinion.

Love it!  Made it just as stated except for used creamy peanut butter, because it was what I had on hand. I didnt have a thermometer and failed at the soft ball test........  So, I did what others suggested, it took about 5 mins to get to a roaring boil, then I boiled for 11 mins, stirring almost continuously.  It is perfect!  Its soft and creamy, I put it in the fridge to set up quicker and make a cleaner cut.  Will use it again, thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I didn't have a candy themomater so I didn't get it as hard as I think it should have been but it is SOOOOOO yummy.  And I didn't have crunchy peanut butter so I used creamy and it still turned out good.

This is a creamy quick delicious peanut butter fudge recipe.  I did just as another commenter said and cooked  for 6 minutes on a rolling boil.  It turned out beautifully exactly as the recipe is written, smooth, soft but firm set.  This one will be a holiday regular.

Fantastic! Takes around 25 minutes start to finish including clean up. I couldn't bear to put 4 whole cups of sugar in this. I stopped at 2 1/2 and it turned out just fine. I used creamy PB and a whole bag of mini-marshmallows in lieu of the crunchy PB and creme. I think I'll do as someone above suggested and cut the butter in half and double the PB. Really good fudge!

I made this exactly according to the recipe directions, and it wouldn't set up.  It's the consistency of very thick ice cream topping, which is probably what I'm going to have to use it for.   I'll have to try one of the other recipes on here.

This Peanut Butter Fudge has a great flavor. Make sure you boil it long enough or it won't set up. This happened to me the first time I made it. My fudge reached the soft boil stage on my therometer but was still to soft. You might want to check by dropping into cold water.

Yummy! The flavor is great. Presentation, is good, too  It did take much longer to cook to soft ball stage, almost 20 mins. Be careful not too get temp to high too quick, ( it will stick and burn). Stirring a lot will help.  Prepared marshmallows (used 27 - large), Peanut Butter ( creamy) and vanilla, while it was cooking, this was very helpful, in beating stage. I beat it until smooth for about 5 mins, using a kitchen-aid. Very smooth and creamy. Yummy! Enjoy! Will make again, Thanks!

I've made this for years - and it is, without a doubt, the most consistently magnificent fudge I've had the pleasure of making.  No changes made - none are ever needed.  It sets up gloriously every single time and it comes out so smooth and rich, it's almost beyond words.

I have made this recipe many times over the last 30 years. I have also made others, and I all ways come back to this one. You don't need a candy thermometer.  Follow the directions exactly as they are written and you will have perfect peanut butter fudge.  I have used both creamy and chunky peanut butter. It is wonderful either way.

Delicious!!! Great and Easy recipe...but for those that haven't made candy... You do have to let it boil for 10 to 20 mins to reach a soft ball stage... other than that it is Super easy and delicious..

I give this recipe an average of 4 stars: 3 stars because I followed the recipe exactly and the fudge never set up. I did put it in the freezer the following day and it had the consistency of set up fudge. I give the recipe 5 stars for taste. Everyone loved it, all the teenaged guests just rolled it into balls after it sat at room temperature for a few minutes.

Made this last night for my family. I used reduced fat peanut butter (the whole jar, rather than a cup) and fat & cholesterol free evaporated milk. Turned out fantastic! Great recipe!

My grandma gave me her recipe for peanut butter fudge before she went into "the home."  It never worked because she wrote it down incorrectly (on purpose, I think).  I was so happy to find this - it is perfect, and instantly carries me back to childhood.  Makes enough to share, which you'll want to do because it is addictive!  I'll even send some to Grandma.
