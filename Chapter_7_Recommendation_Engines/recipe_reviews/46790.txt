This recipe makes great tortillas.  Knowing to rest the dough makes all the difference--the tortillas roll paper thin! I used Olive Oil in place of shortening and it worked fine--no hydrogenated fat that way.  I also cut the salt to one tablespoon and it was still very salty.  I'd say two teaspoons would be sufficient.

Great! I'll never buy tortillas again.  Very easy recipe. The only tips I have is to watch the cooking time - too long and it gets crispy (softer is better), so make sure it's high heat and fast.  Also, makes great healthy tortilla chips when cut into wedges and toasted in the oven around 225.

Thank-you, thank-you!  My family cooks and measures the same way "a little of that... a pinch of that," etc.  Made it extremely difficult for me to perfect my family's  tortilla recipe. I was very happy so see your measurements for the ingredients, I had been experimenting for a few months.  The only thing I would add is ½ teaspoon of baking soda. 

Don’t forget to follow the instructions.  Mix the shorting with the dry ingredients well and make sure the mixture is consistent before adding the water.  I recommend adding ½  of the water first and knead it a little bit, then add the remaining water and knead again. I tried this recipe twice, the first time I was lazy and put all the ingredients in at the same time and paid for it when my tortillas came out hard.  The second time with a little patience-- they were perfect.  For those of you who have to try this more than once, it’s normal-- flour tortillas are tricky.  You might want to start by making 6 (1/3 of the recipe).  In step three she uses the word “fry”, but it doesn’t mean use oil, she means cook it by putting on a frying pan (best if it’s a non-stick pan) or a skillet.  Good luck!

These came out to perfection! I used these in Quesadillas... and it gave them the perfect homemade Mexican touch. I was very impressed. Just a couple of things I wanted to mention. First of all, the directions are a bit confusing. It sounds like you are supposed to let it cook for 10 seconds (at which point you should see a bubble form) and then you should immediately flip it, letting it cook for 30 seconds... and then flip one more time, letting it cook for yet another 30 seconds. This is incorrect. Here is what you do. Place the tortilla on the griddle and let it sit until you see a bubble form (this can be up to a minute). As soon as you see the bubble, flip it, and let it sit for another 30 seconds. Immediately after you drop the tortilla on the griddle you should already begin rolling out your next one. You should be finished rolling it out by the time both sides of the first one are cooked. One more thing... the surface needs to be more than "lightly floured". If you are not careful, the tortilla will get stuck to your surface, and you will have to begin all over again. Make sure both sides of the tortilla are well floured, and you won't have any problems. All in all, great recipe!

I followed this recipe word for word and it was so dry and crumbley, regardless of how much more water I added. I couldn't roll it out and had to throw it away. I tried again however and used 1 1/4 cup veggie oil instead of 1/2 cup shortening. It turned out AWESOME! I will never ever by store brand again.

These tortillas are great!  The advice to let the tortillas sit for at least an hour is definitely key to rolling them out correctly.  I use all whole-wheat flour and olive oil, and they turn out terrific.  My family loves them!

This is UNBELIEVABLE!  I love this!  I too used Olive Oil and used less salt.  Although the recipe says it yields 18--mine yielded 25!  This is a keeper and SOOOOO EEEEEasy!  Quit buying them--make them!  ;) Delicious!

I used my stand mixer to mix the flour, salt, and shortening.  Then I switched to a dough hook to knead in the hot water.  It works great!  One note for novices:  don't cut short on the water.  Add it all to make it really soft & easy to roll out.

WOW!!!  These tortillas were great.  The dough rolled out very thin and the taste was excellent.  I don't think I will ever buy tortillas again.  I had attempted making tortillas with another recipe first, and they turned out like frisbees, so I was skeptical.  But it was well worth the try!  For this recipe, I did the all white flour and used my food processor to mix the shortening with the flour. I followed the rest of the recipe as written, but used only 1 Tbsp of salt.  I made a few different batches within the 1 to 8 hour resting period, and they all turned out equally well.  Thank you Claudia for sharing this recipe!!!

This is a good starting point, but definitely need to add more shortining.  Also the second time I made them I added less salt and once formed into balls I covered them with wet paper towels for about 40 minutes, this seemed to work well.

The best tortillas I've ever tasted.
I make 1/2 recipe at a time which gives me 9-10 tortillas. I like it better with more white flour so here's my version of this great recipe:
1.5 C whole wheat flour
1 C all purpose flour
1 t salt
1/4 t baking soda
.5 C canola oil
3/4 C boiling water (in the microwave 1.5 min)

I make 9-10 balls and put them on a cookie sheet under a towel, let rest for 1-2 h. Then I fatten the roll with my hand (on papertowel to absorb any extra oil), then roll paper thin on lightly floured counter (I also put some flour on the rolling pin). I have my stove on high heat (#5, and a round griddle) and these only take 15-20 sec per side to bubble a bit and get a few darker brown marks. They are so good that I eat them as snacks with no filling and my 2-year-old loves them too. I'll try them with scrambled eggs & salsa next time.
Thank you for this recipe, I'll keep it forever.

A pretty good recipe. However, they were a bit dry and bland. I had to add another 1/4 cup of water to make a good dough, and even then they were dry. They rolled out very well, but a floured rolling pin is a must! Next time I might add a little taco seasoning to the tortillas to add some flavor. UPDATE: I froze some leftover balls of dough and I also froze some already-made tortillas. The already-made tortillas thawed really well, but the balls of dough were dry and tough and I ended up just throwing them out. If you have extra dough, COOK IT and then freeze it! DO NOT FREEZE THE UNCOOKED DOUGH!

These are sooo delish. I used 1/2 cup of canola oil instead of the shortening,and all wheat flour. These were soo easy. I used my chef tony non stick mat and just rolled them out one at a time. By the time I finished rolling one out the tortilla in the pan was ready to be flipped. about 5-10 seconds on the second side...remove it from the pan and put the next one waiting on the mat into the pan. It was a very relaxing assembly line process. In order to get burrito sized tortillas make sure that your balls of dough are the size of a large meatball (about 1 1/2 to 2 golf balls). This makes 10 to 12 burrito sized tortillas. It was hard to stop my family from eating them warm right off the plate. I had to make 3 batches to satisfy them and have enough for dinner.

Wow! If I could, I'd give this recipe more than 5 stars! Love it! I have been making these tortillas and experimenting with variations on the amounts of flours (I really like 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of all-purpose flour), and I have become quite good at making them. The above combination makes them more easy to roll; I haven't tried the wheat bread flour, as the recipe says, as I haven't been able to find any in my area, but the regular whole wheat seems to work fine. I usually make my own refried beans, some beef or chicken, and add some chili sauce, sour cream and shredded cheese to go with them. My 21-month-old daughter and my husband love them, too. Forgot to mention that I use canola oil in place of the shortening. A bit healthier.

NEED A FASTER WAY TO MAKE THESE?  My husband and I use these to make sandwich wraps practically every day, so we go through a batch quickly. The only substitution I make is to use olive oil instead of shortening (much more healthy and they're great!).   1.  After you've rolled into balls, cover with damp paper towel and let stand (keeps from being too dry and they're easy to roll out).   2.  Using a rectangular griddle, FLATTEN TWO OR THREE BALLS AT ONCE, ROLL THEM OUT AND PLACE ON THE GRIDDLE AT THE SAME TIME @ 375-400 degrees.  3.  While waiting for those tortillas to form bubbles, quickly flatten next 2-3 balls.   4.  Flip your first tortillas when bubbles form.   5. Quickly roll out the balls you just flattened. 6.  Remove finished tortillas from grill and slap on the next 2-3.   7.  Repeat  YOU ONLY NEED TO FLIP THEM ONCE.  COOKING TOO LONG WILL LEAVE THEM BRITTLE.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!   It's awesome!

This recipe makes very good tortillas. I used about 1/3 cup olive oil as a shortening and less salt. You could roll out this dough very thin without tearing, the taste is wonderful too.

These were really good. My husband now perfer wheat over white flour tortillas. I did use less salt (half of what was recommended) and I changed the oil to olive oil.

These are FANTASTIC!  This was my first time making tortillas... I make my own breads and rolls and figured it was time to try tortillas.  I'd heard how hard they were to get right, so I was a little worried.  But they turned out tender, light, and delectable.  I halved the recipe and ended up using 1 1/2 cup white bread flour and 1 cup wwheat flour, 1/3 cup canola oil in place of shortening (I didn't want the olive taste of using EVOO), and a tad more boiling water than called for.  I also kneaded the dough after adding the water, instead of just mixing with a fork.  The consistency of the dough ended up great, nice and smooth and easy to work with.  Half the recipe yielded 12 balls, which rolled out nice and thin for soft taco sized tortillas.  I let the balls rest under a damp towel for 3 hours before rolling and cooking.  When I cooked them, I did so with a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat... they bubbled up really quickly, and each one took maybe 45-55 seconds, but still plenty of time to roll the next one.  I covered them up with a dry towel after cooking so they stayed moist and warm.  They turned out WONDERFULLY and my Mexican-American husband adored them.  I will never buy store tortillas again!  I don't find them too much work at all, and if you really love to cook I doubt you will, either.  In fact, I had great fun making them.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

The longer you let the doughballs set,the easier the dough is to roll out and the thinner you can make the tortillas.  The best!!

I have made this recipe several times with different variations of wheat and all purpouse flour and they always turn out great. Just as good as the ones I have tried in Mexico and several border town tortillarias. A word from the wise, tortilla making takes a few tries to get right so don't be discouraged if they don't come out just right the first time, try and try again!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  I let the dough rest for about 8 hrs and they rolled out so well!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I always made my tortillas from the mix and those are better than the store-bought, but not nearly as tasty and easy to roll out as these.  Here's a tip for anyone struggling to roll out a circular tortilla:  Instead of starting out by making the tortillas into balls, I have a friend who works them into an almost-doughnut shape (picture one of those small cake doughnuts by Hostess), with an indention in the middle instead of a hole.  And, of course, the rounder and more even you make the doughnut shape, the easier it is to roll the torilla out into a recoginizably circular shape.  And, as instructed in the recipe, sprinkling a little flour over the working surface and tortilla top really allows the dough to roll out into the correct shape.  Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!!!  I just made tortillas!  All my friends thought I was crazy to even try, but they turned out to be rather fantastic despite my inexperience in making bread-like items. I used olive oil instead of shortening and added more hot water.  The only problem I ran into was related to my complete lack of knowledge on bread making.  I would have liked more specific information about approximately how long to knead the dough for (I don't know what smooth means in relation to wheat flour). Also, the recipe says to 'fry' but I don't think I was supposed to grease the frying pan, was I?  Like I said, I know NOTHING about cooking. So if mine turned out, ANYONE can use this recipe! Thank you so much!

Having married into a latino family, and finding out that getting recipes is very difficult because my mother-in-law cooks with a pinch of this and a little of that, I was very glad to finally get a tortilla recipe that I could make and that would actually turn out!  This one is yummy and looks just like my mother-in-law's!  I have tried it with different combinations of wheat and white flour and have loved them every time!!

The problem very well may have been that of the cook, but these turned out yucky. They were hard, dry, inedible... I was hoping to find a healthy recipe, but I am now convinced that a good tortilla must be full of bad stuff!

'Way too salty with the 2T salt.  I agree that 2 teaspoons would be better.  I also used 1 c. shortening/lard mixture (as mentioned at end of recipe) and it was too greasy.  Less fat would be better.  I'm looking forward to trying again but I think the recipe needs some adjustments.

Really great. The only thing was that I needed substantially more water than the recipe called for - I probably added another 1/2 - 3/4 cup extra. After that though - really delicious. I was able to roll them out really thin, which was great.  I used an olive oil spray to spray the frying pan, and it was perfect.

I used olive oil instead of shortening, and I changed the cooking method a bit. I put the tortilla in the pan, and waited until it bubbled in a few places, which took maybe 30 seconds. Then i turned it just once for about 10 seconds. If the pan is hot enough it doesn't seem to need more than this. They're soft and easy to wrap, and taste great.

This recipe was so cool. It was very easy.I made this recipe 7 times this week and tried diferent amounts of water. I found that using 2 cups of water and olive oil instead of shortening gave the best taste and texture to roll out. I am having a youth funraiser at church for a week long field trip. The fundraiser is a Mexican dinner that I am in charge of. This will help keep the cost down, so more money for the kids. YEAH!

This recipe was great! Tasted very good and   although I found it to be very dry and hard to make the flat tortillas perfectly round it was ok.  I recommend that everyone take cautions while reading the instructions, because although it says wait for a bubble to form on the dough, what she meant was wait for the dough to take on a DOME SHAPE or a BUBBLE SHAPE.  thanks again for the recipe.

We LOVE this recipe. I use all wheat flour and I use raw coconut oil in place of the oil.  I found that a wet cloth over the tortilla balls helps keep them from drying out. Like others have mentioned they roll out super thin.

It was really cool to make tortillas myself.  The tortillas were a nice texture and tasted great.  I used the olive oil instead of the shortening and mixed it all with my kitchenaid.  Portioning the dough out the size of golf balls, I got over 30 6-in tortillas.  It didn't require any flour for rolling and it was pretty easy to roll out thinly. I used a bowl to cut out neat circles though, because I can't roll into nice circles.  In short, tasty and easy recipe.  A tortilla press would be awesome to avoid having to roll it all out.

I have made this recipe twice already and it is excellent!  I place the dry ingredients and shortening in my food processor and then gradually add the water until the dough is smooth.  Like others have posted, I  have to add up to an extra 1/4 cup of hot water...I didnt use boiling water either, very hot water works fine too. Also, I place all the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes to an hour. Then I pinch off amounts of dough, roll into a ball, then roll out with a rolling pin. I found this method works best for me.

You definitely need to play with the ingredient amounts to come up with a nice, pliable dough....the first couple I tried to roll into a ball were on the dry side, so I added a tich more water and needed the dough some more....I got 18 small-ish size tortillas out of the batch using a golf ball size.  I took some reviewers advice and used Olive Oil in place of shortening (healthier).  Also added 2 heaping tablespoons of ground flax seed for a boost of nutrition.  Overall, great recipe, as I said, just need to tweak it to your liking and consistency.

After trying this recipe several times, I finally got the perfect tortillas by making these changes: I used a pancake griddle to cook them. That way it was evenly cooked with no brown spots. I used all Olive oil, that I mixed with the hot water before adding to the flour (Much easier than rubbing the shortening in the flour and then adding the water!) Add a few more tablespoons of water than the recipe calls for and it will be easier to roll out. (But don't add too much otherwise it will become very sticky) Also the tortillas tasted better when I cooked the tortillas immediately after preparing the dough (no need to let the dough sits for hours - it drys out!)

I cut the recipe in half and made 10 large tortillas. I used olive oil instead of shortening, and I increased the amount of water because the dough was very dry. After forming the dough into balls, I let it sit for about 1/2 hour. The dough was very easy to work with and not sticky at all, and I was able to roll the tortillas paper thin. They fried up beautifully. Thanks for the great recipe: I'm going to use it often!

Just made these and they are SOOOO good!  I always make my tortillas, but pretty much use a different recipe every time since I never find one I love.  These were GREAT!  I increased the recipe to 24 servings and ended up getting 32 good size tortillas out of it.  They roll very thin.  I use oil instead of shortening and had to add a little bit more boiling water since they were a little dry.  Also I added a tsp of baking powder and mixed it all with my dough hook on my kitchenaid.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 1/2 the salt, and substituted coconut oil for the shortening. Almost set the house on fire because I used my cast iron pan. They didn't roll out into perfect circles. I was afraid I burnt them because of all the smoke from my pan (I had the heat set really high). But O.M.G!!!!!!!!! They tasted SO GOOD!!!

Added a few herbs and garlic powder and used them for fish tacos. Rolled out nice and thin, even though I was in a rush so I couldn't let them rest.

The first time I tried making this I followed the recipe exactly because I had never made tortillas before.  It turned out to be a crumbly mess...SO I tried again.  This time I almost doubled the amount of olive oil (used instead of lard) and water.  I also added a teaspoon or two of baking powder.  They turned out great the second time!

I love this recipe, albeit I keep altering it a bit every time I make it. I use olive oil but my I actually omitted it completely in my latest batch of tortillas. I make my tortillas w/ 5 cups of whole wheat flour, 2 tsp salt, and enough boiling water to give me a nice doughy consistency (probably closer to 2 cups to make up for the missing EVOO). This makes for a delicious, healthy, low-fat, soft tortilla!

These were really good. I made them last night for dinner and made quesadillas with them. I did use lard in place of shortening and used white whole wheat. They were far from perfectly round, but were still delicious. I put the leftovers in a ziplock bag in the fridge and they're still great, I'm eating a bean rice and cheese burrito with one right now! *Update: I made these again today, except today I didn't use whole wheat bread flour, I used white bread flour. I also used 1 cup of lard. They turned out great! Very soft and pliable.

This was good and easy to do. For people who may wonder, like I did, if substituting olive oil use the same proportion as stated for the shortening. This however, imparts an olive oily flavor.

THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!!! I have tried for 15 years to make tortillas. Each time I'd fail and throw the idea away. Then I decided to try it again with your recipe. I didn't use the wheat flour. I just made flour and I used my electric mixer. They were AWESOME!!!! I am so excited. I am hispanic, and although my grandmothers both made homemade tortillas I never got to learn prior to their passing. So Thank YOU again!!!!

I dared to make this recipe for a dinner party without trying it first.  It turned out quite well though my golf sized balls produced 16 six inch tortillas.  Our guests were running late, so I put the tortillas in a metal pan lined and covered with foil in a warm oven at 175F for about 35 minutes.  When serving the tortillas, I paired it with a Southwestern Tortilla Chicken Soup, and let my guests top their tortillas with guacamole, green onions, cilantro, sour cream, and cheese (or just plain butter) if they wanted it.  Overall, a huge success--every last one was eaten.

These were so easy and delicous too!  Iloved how they had less fat and used whole wheat flour.  I used my electric mixer to do the kneading for me and they worked out fine.  I added some ground cumin, just for some more excitment, and make them a bit larger than in the directions.  I will never buy tortillas from a store again! Thanks Claudia!

These turned out great!! (after I turned the stove down and stopped smoking up the house:))I used these in enchiladas (Betty Crocker recipe) and couldn't taste the difference from store bought tortillas. These are a keeper for me! Thanks! 
I used a damp towel over the dough while it was resting so it didn't dry out any. easy to roll out.

I used olive oil instead of the shortening and added 1/2 tsp baking soda. Perfect! They roll out so easily.

Very good tortillas...the only thing I changed was I used olive oil in place of the shortening, just to make it healthier.

I made these last year. Loved them. Started making all our bread and got "off" tortillas. Bought a pkg. from the store. . .tasteless. . .Made these again today. Not buying them anymore. These have a great taste and they're really not all that hard to make. I don't use a press. I prefer them rolled very thin (they puff up when they "bake" on the griddle). Very good recipe! Thank you! You could add more flavor to your tortillas, if you wish, by adding onion powder, garlic, etc. I didn't even need to flour my counter today, so none of that "burnt flour" taste on them.

Even though I couldn't find my rolling pin and used a wine bottle, these turned out fantastically.   Followed the recipe exactly and my husband and teenage son both requested that I never again buy tortillas in the store.   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I've tried a few tortilla recipes with whole wheat before and never was satisfied... but I made these last week and they came out awesome. I didn't have shortening on hand, so I used vegetable oil instead. Very pilable even after a few hours being placed in a dish towel. I used them to make some beef, potato  & cheese burritos for my brothers and they they held up so well, none of them cracked,  ripped or split while I assembled them. This is a keeper recipe for me!

Sometimes technique makes all the difference.  I made a different recipe that I found in Taste of Home magazine, same ingredients different directions.  The first 2 came out like huge round crackers.  This recipe saved the rest of the batch by providing the proper technique to make wonderfully soft and fluffy tortillas.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and your mom's technique Claudia!

I just made these tortillas. Wonderful taste. I added half tsp of baking powder just because that's what I do when making regular flour tortillas. Also, I did not wait an hour to roll them out. No problem. Very tasty and easy. My husband ate them right off the "comal" (pancake grill).

This works very well.  A 1/4 measuring cup works well for determining the size of the ball.  My golf balls were too small.

To those who have a problem getting the tortillas to be round. It takes practice, and if you roll the tortilla first time, up then down, then rotate 1/2 turn , roll up then down, then rotate 1/2 turn again, continue until you get it the right thickness you want. With practice they will be round before you know it and not be animals. HaHa! This recipe is similar to my own except I use the whole 5 lbs of flour. I make alot at one time. Plus I also add baking powder. I also leave the dough in a big ball and let rest an hour then pinch off balls the size of a golf ball when I am ready to roll them out. I will try one of the other reviews about the oil. I have been wanting to use oil instead of shortening but didn't really know how much to use.
Thanks for the info.

These were great; I had homemade quesidillas on the table in less than 1/2 hour from concept to completion.  Like a previous reviewer, I used olive oil instead of shortening.  I also used all whole wheat (King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour), and didn't use a resting time.  I eyeballed the ingredients (made about 4 tortillas), and didn't use a rolling pin.  I usually don't make so many changes to recipes, but I had a hungry husband and so was seriously pressed for time and had to use what I had on hand :).  With the olive oil, I didn't heat the pan on high, though; it might have burned.  I used medium instead, and they came out just right.  Thanks!

These are good and easy to make! I did end up having to use a little extra hot water to get the dough smooth.I made ahead of time and let the balls set with a damp cloth till I was ready to make them later in the day.If your worried about the frying and rolling at the same time;roll a few out ahead of time(they wont stick to each other if you stack them).

These were an absolutely wonderful find! I have been looking for a way to make a healthier tortilla since my husband cannot have white bread. I used all whole wheat flour for his benefit, and omitted the salt (we haven't used it in years). I also followed another reviewer's advice and used olive oil instead of shortening. My family loves these tortillas and we have them often. Thank you!

I used the all-purpose flour method, and I added two tsp baking powder and reduced the salt to just a tad over 1 tsp...but....omigod!  This is awesome.  I used to travel 30 minutes to a store that sold tortillas this good.  Wait til people find out how easy they are to make.  By the way, I used a non-stick pan and added no product to prevent sticking, worked perfectly.

Excellent! So much cheaper than buying whole wheat tortillas at the store.  Because I can not roll out a good circle shape,  I turned a small dinner plate over and cut out a perfect circle.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this twice now, both times with all white flour (AP), the 1st time with the olive oil substitute and second time with the shortening. Both times they came out really tasty! But i'd have to say, I prefer the shortening because they come out flakier and don't look as translucent as the one with the olive oil. I also had to add a little extra water so the dough came together better. I used a moist towel to cover them while they rested and after cooking, I stacked them on a plastic bag and covered with a moist towel to keep them nice and soft. I will make these again. They are very yummy. I am making chicken enchiladas right now with the batch I made with shortening. Mmmm MMmmm!!

I also tried the recipe using olive oil. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I had a hard time rolling out the tortillas.  The first one crumbled as I was rolling it.  I tried adding more water or oil, and it made it a tiny bit easier.  They are tasty.

Great recipe! I follow the recipe exactly. I love to make breakfast burritos with these by mixing together 1 lb sausage with about 5 eggs (scrambled). I just wrap 'em up into the burrito, then wrap 'em again in plastic wrap, and pop 'em in the freezer! They can be microwaved good as fresh in less than a minute.

Substitute low fat butter instead of shortening and only use 1 tsp of salt. I waited 30 mins for the dough instead of min. 1hr and they turned out great!

This recipe is great! I used all whole wheat flour (5 cups) and replaced the shortening with softened butter. The recipe makes a lot so I put them in the freezer and take them out as I need them. Perfect system. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were terrific!  I used expeller expressed coconut oil (no flavor)as my oil.  I have a tortilla press so these came out not only perfect shaped but delicious!  As they get done, I stack them in an open ziplock bag laying on its side (they can touch) so the steam continues to do its magic as I finish the batch.  then store them in same bag. YUM YUM YUM

I rated this based on my changes. I found this dough super easy to work with. I let it rest for an hour because I had phone calls to make anyway. I used half and half all purpose and whole wheat flours and olive oil in place of shortening.

I live in a country where you can't get flour tortillas and I have tried another recipe that turned out well, but the dough was SO elastic that it took forever to roll them out.  For these I subbed oil for the shortening and they turned out well, SO easy to roll out!  I also put them straight from the pan into a plastic bag with a towel inside to keep them from drying out.  We ate them for several days and will definitely make again next time I make a pot of refried beans!  I didn't love them enough to make them when we move back to the US, though, because I am in love with those "bake your own" tortilla dough circles at Costco.

This recipe is sooo good and easy!  I changed it a little bit by using all whole wheat flour and palm/coconut shortening.  Family and friends are always wanting me to make more!  I think that the boiling water is the real key here, causing it to be elastic and very easy to roll out and handle.  Although they are very good even the 3rd day, ours are always gone before then :)

This recipe is so good!! I use only this recipe for tortillas now. Just make sure the tortilla balls don't split apart. If this happens it's because you need more shortning. I subsutute 3/4 C. of vegtable oil instead of shortning and it makes it easy to mix.

I have a tortilla press, so I modified: instead of 1 1/2 c water, I used about 2 c to make a softer dough. I also added 2 t garlic powder, 2 t chili powder, and  1/2 t cayenne pepper.  A great recipe overall!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I used olive oil instead of shortening/lard, and it turned out great! I made soft taco's with these tortillas, they were the best ever.

Really yummy tortillas, way nicer than the supermarket ones.  I didn't have whole wheat bread flour so I sieved some normal stuff (I don't like too much of the bran).  The golf ball sized ones were a little small so I made a few big ones as well, they were quite troublesome to roll even with a tortilla press but they eventually got there, probably just needed more resting time.

I love this recipe! It's so simple and yummy! My favorite is the all white  flour one, I've tried with the whole wheat flour and that's pretty good, but we prefer white flour tortillas. I tried it with veg/olive oil and they were ok, but again we prefer the taste of the shortening.

used all whole wheat flour (maybe a tablespoon or two less) because ww absorbs more moisture.  also replaced shortening with EVOO. Excellent recipe, never thought tortillas is that easy to make.  i didn't have to use any flour to roll out the dough since my silicone mat and rolling pin are well "seasoned" - everytime i clean the pin or mat, i only used wet paper towel so like my wok, don't have to worry about things sticking.

I could only find plain bread flour so I mixed half with whole wheat flour, and used olive oil instead of shortening. Turns out fabulous! Super easy, super tasty! I'll never buy tortillas from the store again!

Ok I am in a country that you can not just go out to the store and buy Flour Tortillas so I though well I will just have to learn how to make them. I have tried once before with white wing but it never worked. So here in Hanoi, Vietnam they only have wheat flour which worked GREAT with this recipe. I did add 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda and I used butter shorting instead of plain shorting which made a big differance. Also I use almost boiling water and slowly added. I have a kitchen Aid and I used the dough hook for the whole process of making this batch. I first added all the dry ingredients then the shorting and last the water slowly. I covered the dough with a warm paper towel while I was rolling out the dough which keep the doug from drying out. I love this recipe so much I made three batches and I batch for chips which I baked in the oven. This is a keeper.

This recipe is the main reason I keep whole wheat flour in my dorm.  They are simple and easy to make.  I use canola oil instead of shortening and they come out quite well.  You can use 3/4 c. of oil for the tortillas instead of 1 c., but they're a little drier cooked that way.

I tried this recipe using white flour and canola oil.  I halved the recipe and it made about 12 tortillas (about 7 inches).  Perfect for our burritos/tacos.  WOW!  The best burritos I've ever made.  And it really wasn't THAT much extra work.  (Considering I bought the chicken already roasted!) I used my stand mixer, using the paddle up until the point where you add water, when I switched to the dough hook.  Rolled the balls and let them set for an hour.  The cooking takes some practice (I had my heat too high at first) but they are still delicious.  I will definitely be making them again - I don't know if my husband will ever let store-bought tortillas in the house again!

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I used extra virgin olive oil for the shortening as well. The second time I added a cup of ground flax seed to the mix, and upped the boiling water slightly to moisten the batch (accounting for the increased dry ingredient). I  only let it rest for about a half hour (time restraint!), but it turned out really well and added that extra nutritional value. Thanks for a great recipe!

We used all white whole purpose flour, and while it took a little while to get the cooking technique down these were absolutely amazing.  The flavor is great, we used them for quesadillas and they were so good.  Will not buy store bought again.

These are very very good. I use all white flour. I've made them twice now. The first time I had too much flour down when I rolled them so they tasted to floury. The second time I didn't get them rolled thin enough and my family didn't like them as much. I think 1-2 hours is perfect to let them rest. The last time I let them rest for 6 hours and I think they were too dried out to get them thin enough.

I made two batches when I tried these. One basically followed your recipe and  for the second I made the following changes:
1.substitute canola oil for shortening
2.reduce salt to 1 teaspoon
3.add about 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal

Both batches turned out great. The second batch rolled out thinner and I had to be careful not to rip the tortillas, but they're probably a bit healthier than the ones made with shortening and you can fit more toppings on them. I didn't fry mine so long; I found a total of about 50 seconds ideal.

Thanks! I've been looking for a good recipe for homemade tortillas.

I have an electric tortilla press/baker

shuns anything whole wheat so I used 2 c. unbleached and 3 c. whole wheat.  He loved them.

I made these last night exactly how the recipe reads and they turned out awesome! I made quesadillas with them and my son raved about how tasty they were.  I'll try making them  with olive oil next time though just for  a healthier  variation, otherwise I wouldn't make any major changes.

Seriously the best tortillas I have ever had, and I love being able to make them the exact size I want them to be.  I let mine rest for two hours before rolling out and frying and love the flex time.  I also used safflower oil rather than lard.  Awesome recipe, Claudia.

What a great recipe!  I added a couple of tablespoons of rye flour to the whole wheat flour to give the tortillas some chewiness.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderful!  I served the tortillas with "curried hummus" recipe from this site as a an appetizer.  It was a nice healthy change from the usual chips and dip!  I will be making these again and again!

I think these have potential, but I had trouble with the dough balls drying out, even though I covered them.  When we cooked them, they also turned out a little too hard... ended up having tostadas instead of burritos.  They did have good flavor though, but they were just too hard.  I agree with the others, I went with 2 teaspoons of salt.

My family loved these!!  Didn't have any problems.  Did, however, have to add (gradually) more water while mixing.  No problems rolling them out, and enjoyed not having to buy the store bought kind!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Surprisingly soft and tasty for a recipe with such a high ratio of wheat to white flour! I will make these again, albeit with a bit less salt.

In a country without tortillas, this is a lifesaver. I followed another reviewers advice and used olive oil and half the salt. I let the dough rest an hour and a half and used my heated press, and they turned out super. Guilt-free wraps and burritos!

Homemade whole wheat tortillas have become a mainstay in my home, thanks in part to this excellent recipe! I use canola oil instead of shortening (although I would like to try it with shortening sometime), but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. Some reviewers mentioned that these are labour-intensive-- problem solved by making 6-9 at a time. I spend 10 minutes preparing the dough an hour ahead of time and 10-15 minutes rolling and frying at dinner time.  It's super easy! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic!  I used canola oil instead of shortening and that worked just fine.  During the kneading process, I did add a bit more oil to help bind the dough.  Overall, it was a bit of work but so worth it!

These are excellent tortillas.  I substituted bread flour for the white flour (because we are trying to stay away from white flour) and used butter for the shortening.  I don't know if it was using bread flour or the fact that I live in the desert, but I found I needed an extra quarter cup or so of water.  I also found that the tortillas were difficult to roll out, using only ½ cup shortening.  The taste is great, so I will be making these again.  Next time I will use at least ¾ cup of butter.  (I got the idea for butter from a tortilla recipe on the Mexconnect.com site, which is really good if you add another cup of flour).  We live in El Paso, with a majority Hispanic population, and we have discovered that the best tortillas we've every had are rolled very thin.  One nice thing about this recipe is that even when you roll the dough out thin enough to be transparent, it still lifts off the pastry mat easily.  Also, I did not need to use any flour during the rolling process.

Have made them a second time, this time using ¾ cup of shortening, and they rolled out very easily.  This time I substituted mesquite flour for the white flour, and they turned out even better (if that's possible).  The mesquite adds a sweetness with a hint of vanilla, which is wonderful.  The first time I made these I made balls about 1.75 ounces; this time I tried the recommended 2 ounce size.  The smaller ones are much easier to handle, especially when rolled very thin.

These turned out great! To make it healthier I used all fresh ground whole wheat flour and substituted coconut oil for the shortening.  Used all the same proportions as the recipe.  Very yummy!

Yummy. The trick is, you have to use very hot water for the dough. This way you you won't have to use any flour later to roll it out (the more flour the harder it would be). You can easily make it as thin as you wish. Definitely a keeper receipe

Great  recipe, although i made a few changes, just to make it a bit healthier. Well i divided everything in half, cause i don't need that many tortillas. Then i substituted all-purpose flour with wheat germs and shortening with the same amount of olive oil (i think u might use less) and as i only make quesadillas i put less salt. And tortillas were perfect! easy to fold (not like it is sometimes with whole grain flour) with hearty taste.

This is my first attempt at making homemade tortillas and they didn't turn out like I thought they would.  They turned out tough and dry and would only bubble up when I brushed them with Crisco while they were cooking.  Not sure what I did wrong-maybe a kneaded the dough too much.  I did let them rest for 2 hours.  I will probably try this recipe again though.

We made these VEGAN by using coconut oil and they turned out great. We did a 1/2 recipe and  when we rolled the dough into balls, they separated a bit, so we just wet our hands and it worked well. They cooked best with a bit of olive oil rubbed on the pan with a paper towel (if not cast iron). They made nice chips under the broiler for a bit. We'll use this a lot! Thanks!

These are easier to make than you might think... I don't care for shortening, so opted for canola oil instead.  This recipe yielded 25 tortillas for me, not the 18 listed.  I'll try all white flour next time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Loved these. They came out great the first time. I chose to make a half batch for the first try, opted to swap the whole wheat and white flour proportions, and, as others have said, cut down the salt. They came out wonderfully light and with great texture. I also used the food processor for a quick way to cut in the shortening, but added the boiling water in small amounts and combined with a fork. The dough came together perfectly. I was so surprised at how thinly these could be rolled out. Absolutely amazing. They were great with homemade refried beans for burritos. The whole family loved them. They sure are economical too. I hope to convince my DH to quit buying the packaged kind and let me make these to stock us up on tortillas. Love them!!!

tHIS IS THE FIRST recipe that works. Usually the tortillas end up hard but htese did not. My mom also used to just throw it all together without measuring but i wanted whole wheat tortilas instead of plain white flour. Thanks and I woudl also recommend less salt.

Great recipe!  I've been looking everywhere for a recipe made without shortening, so I was happy to read the reviewer who tried it with olive oil.  I made mine with vegetable oil, and it worked out wonderfully.  I did have to cook it longer than it said, but that's preference and also depends on the thickness of the tortilla.  I won't be buying store-bought again!

I only made half a batch of these tortillas because it was my first time making them.  They came out great!  I had no trouble and my husband requested that I make them instead of buying them from now on.  The only changes I made was I added 1 tsp of gluten per cup of whole wheat flour (didn't have whole wheat bread flour), used olive oil instead of shortening, and reduced the salt slightly.  So yummy!  I will definitely be making them again!

Great tortillas!  I've made tortillas probably a dozen times and this was the best recipe by far.  I made it exactly as listed.  I used white flour as mentioned in the notes.  The only thing I would do differently next time is make the balls of dough a little bigger so that I could have thicker tortillas.  These ones were thinner than I've ever been able to make them before, but I admit that I kinda like them a little thicker.  It's just my personal reference.  I used shortening, but I think these would be even tastier with lard, particularly bacon grease.  I just have trouble using lard in recipes since it's so bad for you!

These were so easy to make! I didn't have any shortening around, so I used a stick of butter instead. They taste so delightful--just like restaurant-style tortillas only better because they're homemade! I squeezed 33 6" tortillas out of this recipe.
I don't know if it's because I used butter instead of shortening, but I required no extra flour to roll them out. Also, I chopped up the butter together with a few spoonfuls of the flour mixture in a food processor before stirring it into the rest of the flour mixture. Saved a lot of time!
I will make these again!!

The first time I made these I only let them rest for just on an hour and they weren't very nice - rather rubbery, but I persevered and let them rest for 3 hours this last time and they came out perfect, aside from the fact that I can't roll out a perfect circle!  I used margarine instead of shortening and everything else exactly the same.  Hubby was very impressed.  And this is way cheaper than buying - these cost about a quarter of the price to make.

EXCELLENT!!! I was looking for just the right recipe and found it. I had a friend years ago who was Mexican and she cooked "torts" as she used to call them for short. I used to make them along with her as I knew how to make rotis (which is an indian flat bread). She used to also make from these a pastry she called manuellos' or curspanios (forgive the spelling). I enjoyed these and your recipe is identical to hers only she used white flour always and for this first batch I did the same. This recipe brought back many wonderful memories for me and I will get back into making my breads alot more both rotis and tortillas. Thanks a million

The first time I made these I thought it might be too much work...but honestly, every time I make them it gets easier and easier. I use freshly ground spelt flour in place of the wheat flour, and olive oil instead of shortening. They're fantastic!

THANK YOU!! I have been looking for a recipe that was close to my late grandmothers and this is it. Not exact, but the closest I have ever come!! She didn't measure anything, so it was difficult to find one. I do prefer the straight flour ones, I found the wheat ones to be good, but a little harder to work with. I have made several batches, and while the one I made with lard was yummier, I will continue to make them with the healthier oil. I do add extra water though, when I followed the recipe exact, they were thicker and tougher. The main thing I noticed was that the dough appeared yellow (from the oil) when I didn't have enough water. It should look the same color as the flour if you have enough. The dough should roll very thin very easily, and be stretchy as you remove it from the counter and put it in the pan. Getting the right amount of flour to roll it in is tricky too, it will take some practice. Too much and the excess flour will burn on your pan, and you will have black specks all over every tortilla. Very good though, I get RAVE reviews and they disappear fast! I prefer to double it, but then I get my husband to do the cooking part, that is my least favorite part! They freeze well too. I doubled one to have some for next time, but we flew through the other 1/2 so quick that they only lasted 3 days in the freezer, but were just as yummy. Have patience if you have never done them before, it will take practice to roll them out just right. Even though these were my 1st

Great recipe. I used olive oil instead of the shortening and to add some more fiber I used the combination of 1/4 cup + 2 TBSP olive oil + 6 TBSP ground flaxseed and it tasted great!! you can use 3 TBSP of ground flax seed to replace 1 TBSP fat.

This recipe worked well for us! We used butter instead of normal shortening. We ran out of whole wheat flour so we used regular flour to fill in the rest. For burrito-sized tortillas, I'd suggest making 3 oz to 4 oz balls, like that of another review.

These were awesome.  I decided to make these because I didn't feel like going to the grocery store to get any for my dinner.  I was skeptical at first because they looked very grainy, but they were delicious.  They also were not that difficult.  I will definitely make these again!!

Great recipe. I did not have whole wheat bread flour, so I just used all-purpose whole wheat flour and added some gluten (just replace one teaspon of each cup of flour for one teaspoon of gluten). Thanks for sharing!

I have made these several times now and have been very happy.  I will never buy tortillas again.  It is so nice knowing exactly what you are eating.  I made them again today and decided that tomorrow I am going to buy a tortilla press....that way we can have them more often!

i'm a novice cook, but i enjoy tinkering around the kitchen. these tortillas were so easy to make! i used APF, and olive oil, as suggested by some. i made half of the original recipe, and rolled out smaller rounds, like 5" across. they're perfect wraps for an in-between snack. goodbye store bought! :)

I found this recipe very tastey and super easy. I've recommended it to many of my friends. It will certainly become a favorite! I found that I, as well as many others, had to add a bit more water.It also worked great in my mixer, made the process that much easier.

I love this recipe!  We have made them several times changing things here and there which not only means they are very tasty, but the recipe is fun to play with.  I took the advice of others and used olive oil instead of shortening and I have also used only all-purpose flour instead of the wheat flour (our favorite--we then smother them with honeybutter.  Not healthy but very good!).   I did find that I needed to add an extra 1/4 cup of water to get the dough the right consitency.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and used my heavy duty mixer to mix it all, using the dough hook when I added the water. All in all this is a great recipe!  Thanks!

The only change I made to the recipe is sub the all purpose flour for rye flour. The result: TERRIFIC!! It was so easy to roll (unlike other tortilla recipes I've tried), came out soft and really delicious! So far I've only made a wrap with the tortilla. Can't wait to try make other stuff.

I have never tried to make tortillas before so I started this expecting it to fail (at least for the first few tries). Well, they came out perfectly! The recipe was very easy, and it did not take long at all to knead. I used a blend of olive oil and canolla oil instead of shortening, and used a tortilla press instead of rolling out the dough. My boyfriend said they were better than his Grandmother's! What a compliment. I did have to use almost 2 cups of water to get a smooth dough, but I was expecting to have to play with the recipe a bit. This will be something I will be making often, no more store bought tortillas for this house!

This is the first time I've made tortillas and they were great. Easy to handle dough and easy to roll out. I followed suggestions and cut the salt, but I think 1 Tbl. would be better than 2 tsp. Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe! Have made them a couple times now, and both times very easy.  The only change I make is to sub coconut oil for the shortening.  I also put the cooked tortillas in a ziploc bag as soon as I take them out of the frying pan (I use a non-stick pan and the burner set on "2").  This helps keep them moist and pliable.  Very comparable to bought ones without all the chemicals.

I really like this recipe.  Like other reviewers, I substituted olive oil for shortening and used all wheat flour.  Also covered with moist paper towel while dough was resting.  

My hesitation in making these is that I LOVE the uncooked Tortilla Land tortillas that you can buy at Sam's Club and Costco because I love being able to make them fresh when I'm ready to eat them.  So, when I made these I set several dough balls aside and did not cook them.  I rolled them out, laid them on top of each other, placed them flat in a gallon size ziplock bag, and stored them in the refrigerator.  Then when I wanted to use a tortilla I cooked it at that point.  I'm happy to report that it worked perfectly...just like Tortilla Land.  The rolled out tortilla dough was easy to pull apart and cooked great.  I used them within a couple days, so I don't know how long they will keep, but I'm thrilled!

Next time I make these, I think I'll try putting herbs in the dough.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe two times. Once with olive oil once with shortening. Both times the dough came out incredibly dry and so very difficult to knead. I don't know what happened. I followed the instructions. I chalked it up to the wheat flour I guess. I too was looking for a healthier tortilla.

Good flavor.  I increased the balls to 4oz and still only got about 8" tortillas, but I may not have rolled them thin enough. 2oz of dough rolled out to about 4", perfect for taco shells.

Great recipe! But definitely read through the reviews. Mine were delish, but came out a little crispy on the edges. I am thinking I didn't incorporate the shortening well enough before adding the water. Also, Whole Foods carries organic all-vegetable shortening. (no trans!) Just remember tortillas take practice, but don't be afraid to give it a try! Very worth your effort. (I also made these completely whole wheat, no white flour.)

An excellent recipe and so easy to make!  The only substitutions I made were to replace the shortening with canola oil and a little less salt (just my personal tastes).  We will never eat store-bought tortillas again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This recipe makes great tortillas! I would give it 5 stars, but I used olive oil in place of the shortening. I also used all white whole wheat flour. The tortillas were delicious. I don't think I can go back to store bought.

I used a little over 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of shortening and followed the instructions carefully. DRY DRY DRY!  I stopped trying to roll them out and fry them...My advice: *if* you want to try this recipe, take some of the previous suggestions and make half of the recipe first to see if it'll work.

I made these for Chicken Fajitas. This is a great basic recipe but I did notice that my dough was a little dry and crumbly after incorporating the boiling water. I just added a little more water than the recipe called for and that seemed to help it. I used all King Arthur's Whole Wheat Unbleached White Flour and 1/2c Canola Oil and 1/4c Olive Oil. I also used a small saucer to measure perfectly round tortillas. They tasted SO good my son couldn't get enough of them. Will DEFINITELY make this recipe again. It was surprisingly easy.

Delish.  Made with fresh ground flour and only used 4 cups and it turned out great.  The family loved them.

I love them, the kids love them.  I use only hwole wheat flour and do not add salt since the filling is usually salty.  I make them all the time even though it is time consuming.

Good, but a little dry and crumbly. I think it needed more Crisco. I used self rising flour and left out the salt. I scaled this down and it worked out fine. I had my black iron skillet over med-hi heat and it took these about 1 min per side to bubble. The water does not have to be boiling just hot from the tap.

I recently moved away from Texas and was really missing the taste of homemade tortillas. These tortillas taste fantastic and are very simple to make. I use butter instead of lard, and they still turn out great.

Just finished making these tortillas. I ate one plain right after cooking and it was delicious. I made mine as the recipe stated but I added fresh herbs, chopped rosemary and thyme, to the flour mixture. I had to add a tablespoon or so extra water to the dough to get a good texture and I also layered the cooked tortillas between damp paper towel b/c the edges seemed to get a little dry as they cooled. They cooked very nicely and I loved that they were made with olive oil. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow for the true test. I am sure I will enjoy my wrap. Will surely make these again and experiment with other additions. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

EXCELLENT. I was able to roll these out super thin and they tasted fantastic. I've never had a whole wheat tortilla from the store, and now I know I never need to try one! Next time I'll experiment with olive oil and perhaps slightly less salt. Thank you for the recipe!

Omitted the all purpose flour.  Added sazon and garlic powder.  I had to make a second batch.  They cook marvelously on a flat cast iron griddle.  If you cook them for 3 minutes per side, they make a cracker type bread.  Ate it with curried cabbage.

This was my first attempt at making tortillas. I think I need to work on it more ;) I did think they tasted great, especially fresh, but mine turned out blackened in spots. I burned the first two at high heat, turned it down to halfway between medium and medium-low for the rest of the batch, and that worked better. There's probably a trick to this I'm not aware of...

I thought these were hard to roll out, they kept breaking. I am going to try more white flour next time to hopefully make them more pliable. They tasted great and worked for the tacos I made them for.

I cannot beleive whole wheat tortillas can taste this good. So tender and flavorful. Roll them thinner than you think they should be and don't be afraid to keep them well floured when rolling. Cook them fast over high heat; you made need to enlist an extra pair of hands to roll and cook at the same time, but it goes much faster than you expect. I thought this task would be much more burdensome, but it was so easy I can't beleive I haven't been making my own tortillas all along.

I have used this recipe twice - with fabulous results.  I never knew that wheat tortillas were so easy, although I am not surprised that they are so tasty when they are warm!  All bread is wonderful that way.  I don't know if I will only ever make my own from now on, but they sure are cheap, easy enough, and tasty enough - and I will always be able to have tortillas without going to the store!  Recipe note:  I find the hour rest utterly unnecessary.  I am not certain what flaw in my finished product could be removed by waiting longer than the 20-30 minutes I tend to wait.

Being born and raised in AZ, tortillas are a staple in our household.  That being said, these were just ok.  I took other reviewers advice and substituted olive oil for the shortening.  Worked great for the Guaco-Taco recipe (also on here) that I needed it for.  But I ate one plain and was completely unimpressed for the amount of work involved and ending nutritional value compared to store bought whole-wheat.

I'm living in Argentina where store-bought tortillas are not an option!  I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil.  The taste was good but I felt they were lacking flexibility.  The second time I used one cup of vegetable oil, and I thought they turned out perfectly.  I use all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat.  Thanks for helping me re-create some of my favorite Mexican recipes here in Argentina!

Great Tortillas, I too did not measure the ingredients and since i have been rolling the Roti-Indian Flat bread( being Indian )for the last 30+ years they were easy- rolled very well and my son loves them I will not buy the store Tortillas ever again.

We searched out this recipe while we were participating in a Daniel Fast, and used only whole wheat flour, olive oil, salt and water and they rolled out great, and were as good as could be expected with the ingredients we were limited to. We plan to play around with the flour ratios and find a new healthy and tastey alternative to store bought tortillas. Can't wait to get a tortilla press! I was mainly impressed that they rolled out so nicely and the recipe actually worked for me, I usually mess up toasting bread!

I made these first try - worked like a charm.  The recipe was really easy and the results were delish!  When storing them in the fridge, they can get a bit crumbly. MUCH better than store bought.

These are fantastic.  The only problem I had with the recipe is the "high" heat -- I had turned it down after my second tortilla but still left it on the high side and it melted my spatula!  I will make these again but I won't keep the heat so high next time.

These tortillas were great.  We used 1 cup of olive oil, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 4 cups all purpose flour (reversing the flour amounts).  Easy to make and definitely worth the trouble.

Excellent!  Tasted like the tortillas my mom used to make.  I did not have whole wheat flour on hand, so I used all white and used Olive Oil.. great!  They were a hit and pretty easy to make.  I rolled them out after an hour of sitting.  This is a keeper!

I loved this recipe! This was my first attempt at making homemade tortillas.  I started with a small batch (1/3 of the recipe) and substituted olive oil for the shortening.  They were okay, but the next batch I made exactly according to the recipe turned out beautifully!  I recommend making a small batch first to practice.  Also, I used my KitchenAid Mixer so I was able to add boiling water to the flour mixture.  My tortillas were easy to roll and I was able to roll them very thin, which I like.  My husband, who never eats plain tortillas, was snacking on them all night!

I did everything according to the recipe and let them sit for 8 hours covered before rolling. They rolled well but when I tried to cook them they would burn in spots and not cook in others.  I tried everything from different temperatures, different pans, different sizes and thickness of dough. Nothing worked. The golf ball size is also so small you can hardly wrap it. I more than trippled the size in order to get a tortilla large enough to hold one egg.  I don't know why it wouldn't cook.

This recipe got off to a bad start because we don't have anything like shortening in India. I used a mixture of butter and ghee (clarified butter) as a substitute. Rolling these out were quite the task and I eventually gave up trying to muti-task between rolling and flipping and cooking on the griddle. At the end of it these tasted pretty much like our Indian homemade "paranthas" had we put more ghee in the atta (dough). After a few unscintillating quesadillas I cut the remaining tortillas into strips and put these in the oven for a few minutes to turn them into nachos. No fault of the recipe, but the hardest foods to replicate are always the simplest staples on an ethnic menu.

these tasted great.  I need tons of practice shaping them and rolling them a bit flatter.  The family was impressed to have real live home made tortillas come out of my kitchen :-)

I tried this recipe for the first time the other day.  I never made tortillas before, so I didn't know what to expect. 

I discovered that you have to add an additional 2/3 cup water and 1/4 cup shortening (on top of what is called for in the original recipe).  Otherwise the result was perfect!  

Also, I formed balls that were slightly larger than a golf ball.  After rolling them out, I laid down a plate over them and cut a round shape out by tracing around the plate, with a knife, for perfectly shaped tortillas!  :)

Awesome Recipe! I use it all the time. Except instead of wheat flour, I'll use spelt. Adding a bit of cinnamon gives the tortillas a desert taste that goes great with honey.

This was my first time making tortillas, and they turned out very good despite one of my evil burners going haywire on me. I substituted olive oil and used half all purpose flour and half wheat flour. I found I had to add a lot more water in to get the dough to become doughy, though. I would try these again... perhaps with a better stovetop!

I have done the "healthy" way and the "unhealthy" way of making these tortillas and they both turn out great!  There is some effort that goes into  making these tortillas, but they are so worth it.  I like the idea that I know exactly what is going into my mouth when I make these tortillas.  I also think this would be a really fun activity to do with my students!  I make these all the time!

I started looking for a whole wheat recipe when i stood in the grocery store, unable to believe how much more expensive wheat tortillas were than flour!  This recipe great!  Very easy and the tortillas taste wonderful.  My husband and my two year old and one year old love them!

I only tried this recipe once but did not like how the tortillas came out.  I did add 3 tsps baking powder as I have seen on other recipes and I substituted butter for the shortening as I don't use shortening.  I should have read the other reviews about olive oil.  I think I will try it again with olive oil and more white flour than whole wheat.  I did let them stand 8 hours but my dough was really dry from the beginning even after adding 1/4 cup boiling water extra.  I cooked them on an iron skillet as I have read elsewhere.  So I'm not sure where I went wrong but don't use my modifications/mistakes.

These were so easy to make! I used olive oil and all King Arthur white whole-wheat flour. It took a little experimenting to get the thickness/thinness right when rolling out the dough (and I still haven't perfected the round tortilla), but all of my first batch turned out.

I've never made tortillas before, but these were a breeze to make. The dough came together easily, and wasn't sticky at all for me. Thanks for a great recipe and for saving me a few dollars at the store!

These were wonderful! Resting the dough does seem to make all the difference, and this really makes a lot. I cut the recipe in half and it still made over 2 dozen. My only modifications were substituting olive oil for the shortening, and adding 1/4 tsp or so of baking soda(I would add a little more if I was making a full amount). These were so good and they keep really well.

This was my first time making tortillas.  Maybe I am just used to the store bought type, but I found these very bland and they took hours to make.  For I will admit the recipe produced a dough that was easy to roll out into very thin tortillas.  I think they need more flavour.  For the time and effort, I will just keep buying tortillas.  This recipe made 30 - 8 inch tortillas.  At least I got a great workout!

Best tortilla recipe I have ever used.  I used 2 cups whole weat flour and the rest white flour and it was good.  I also used more water as suggested by other reviewers and Canola oil instead of shortening since shortening is not very healthy.  I am an American living in South Africa so I use this recipe often to make Tacos and other mexican food for my family!

When I made these they were still crumbly after I added the water.  I pressed on and followed the directions and the tortillas turned out great!  These are delicious dipped in homemade salsa.

These are excellent!  I used 1 cup of shortening and they were very easy to roll out.  It probably would go faster with 2 people, but if you have a little time, it's worth it.

I tried 3 different recipes and I liked this the best.  I love to bake and make homemade, healthy food and I wanted a tortilla recipe to use as bread for my daughter's meals. It is so much easier for her to eat these folded over with pb & j, refried beans, cheese, etc in. She loves them! I had no problem with your recipe - turned out great - thanks! I even made another batch today, cutting the shortening in half to cut down one Weight Watcher point and they still turned out well.

Like my kids would say "These are the BOMB!"  Meaning GREAT! Thank you Claudia these came out so good. I like to watch what I eat so I rather have wheat then regular flour. Used the exact ingreidents and they came out perfect. 
Thanks again

Not happy with this recipe.  Way too much work, would rather just buy them at the store.  Maybe just inexperienced with making tortillas, but found the dough to be sticky and hard to roll out thin enough.  But I did eat the tortillas, they just did not taste how I expected them to.  Will not make them again

Incredibly dry and when rolling it out the ends just crumble and split. The center was so elastic it just kept bouncing back. I let the dough sit for 1 hour with a towel and in a grocery bag and it still formed  a hard crust that I couldn't knead back in easily. I even added more shortening and water then what was called for. Had to throw it out. I'll stick to a 1/2 and 1/2 ratio of wheat and white.

Very easy and tasty!  I had never made them before and am surprised at how easy they are to make.  I used butter instead of shortening.  The picky kids gobbled them up!

I made these with ghee. Other than that, made exactly as written. Very good. A bit bland, but pretty much what I expect for a whole wheat tortilla!

I'm not sure what happened. I followed it exactly and got HARD unusable dough. It was not elastic the way tortilla dough should be. I've made tortillas several times very successfully and couldn't believe I had to throw it all out. I just can't imagine what went wrong. I think next time I'll try oil instead.

Excellent recipe! I had NEVER even attempted tortillas before. My first try resulted in a good tasting flat bread, but it wasn't a tortilla. My second try was great though! I LOVE these tortillas. I see no reason to ever buy from a store again, my husband helps me whip these up and we divide them up and freeze some so they last us quite a while.

These are so easy and so good!!!  I used a cup of lard (and added a pinch of baking soda per reviewers recommendations), everything else according to the recipe.  Rubbing the lard into the flour mixture took me a little while, but it was nice and relaxing and felt good to my fingers.  When kneading, I didn't need to add any flour at all--no sticking whatsoever!  I just kept kneading until the dough was nice and pliable and smooth.  Rolling them out took exactly the right amount of time for the tortilla in the pan to be ready to flip, then I counted 30 seconds, it was done, and on we went.  Thank you so much for posting this INCLUDING your notes at the end!

I used unrefined coconut oil for recipe. They are that much better than store bought (in fact I ate one plain which I would NEVER do with a store bought) but a lot of work for rolling out. My edges were really crinkly- not sure if that was due to type of shortening or....? Would try next time with olive oil maybe.

Easy recipe, I followed the directions exactly and they mixed up perfect!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star recipe is because of the salt taste (which I'll adjust next time) and the fact that they just didn't have as good of a taste as I was hoping for.  I'll make them again with the adjustment to the salt and if that fixed the taste then I'll change it to a 5 star rating!

As a side note for those who experience problems with the rolling part, I'll offer a couple of suggestions.  First, look up what a French rolling pin is and get one of those and throw out your traditional rolling pin because you'll never go back!  I also roll them out between sheets of waxed paper and was able to get them nice and thin without them sticking to anything!

Have never liked the flavor of store bought tortillas, and was excited to find this wonderful recipe for homemade ones! The recipe was easy to follow, using olive oil instead of shortening and, after letting them "rest" awhile, easily rolled them out and cooked them up in a very hot fry pan (no oil), not too long (about 30 seconds each side) so they were nice and soft.  The flavor is fabulous and so much better than store bought!

oh my goodness!  this was EXCELLENT!!!  we used them as wraps for sandwiches and they were so soft and chewy and moist!  my only suggestion is to add just a wee bit more salt and to use butter instead of shortening.  crisco or any hydrogenated oil gives me the heebeegeebees!  if i'm going to eat fat, i'm going to eat REAL fat...not fat made in a factory!  overall, an EXCELLENT healthier tortilla!

This recipe creates perfect tortillas. I have never had any better. Though I did need to add more fat than called for (about 20-30% more).
A note: I've waited and not waited the hour and did not find a significant difference to avoid this recipe when in a rush; so don't worry if you don't have the time to wait around an hour!

Great recipe, I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup shortening.  But did anyone else about die getting them rolled out!  I am having a new found admiration for whoever rolls out enough us these on a daily basis for a large family.  My wrists are tired!  Is there some secret to do this without a struggle??

This is a not a beginner friendly recipe. I followed this recipe exactly (without reading the footnote) and my tortillas turned out hard and dry. It took me forever to roll out the dough, much longer than the minute or so described in the directions. Even though the recipe says to fry on high heat, don't heat the pan on high or spray it or add oil, the tortillas will just soak up the oil or burn even if you watch them. I'm all for healthy cooking, but the ratio of flour to fat is off. At the very least, this needs a little more shortening. I strongly recommend reading the footnote before hand or finding a completely different recipe.

hi claudia, thanks a lot for sharing this recepie. i think sitting the dought for some hours makes the whole difference. i would like to share a tip though. while making the tortillas i made them on a crepes pan and covered it with a lid. after a minute or so if the toritilla is rolled properly it puffs up and then you can take out the lid and cover the tortilla and cook for another minute or so. thanks again !! gr8 recepie

I used a mix of whole wheat and white flour, and substituted olive oil for the shortening.  I had some trouble rolling them thin enough, but they still turned out great.  Much better (and healthier) than store bought.  Next time I might try pressing them into shape with a pie dish instead of rolling them out.

Im sorry these just weren't what I was expecting with all the great reviews I thought they would be really good, they did have good flavor but no one ate more than one and the texture was like a pie crust,I have made white flour tortillas for 20 years and have rave reviews everytime so its not like I was a beginner at making tortillas. I will try another recipe for whole wheat tortillas as I like whole wheat pizza dough and bread.

These turned out great; I think the boiling water really makes a difference and helps keep the dough soft and pliable. I used graham flour (a type of whole wheat flour) and the flavor and texture were wonderful.

This recipe was simply delicious!! Easy to make, easy to follow, and easy to eat! Maybe I shouldnt have given it 5 stars because I didn't follow it exactly, but I did. The only changes I made were to use oil instead of lard and I used about 1/2 the salt.

This is the best recipe for tortillas I have ever used! The only thing I did differently was switch the amount of whole wheat flour with the amount of all-purpose flour to make it not as "wheaty"... because if it's too wheaty, the kids won't eat it. Thanks!

This recipe really worked and  I have never made anything like this.  I followed the directions exactly and used all white flour (still the all purpose and bread flour) They were so delicious and my family was amazed!

AWESOME !!This is my first attempt at tortillas, and we do like whole wheat breads....these are wonderful, good flavor, I used Crisco...soft.  I rolled the balls rather small.... Got 5 inch tortillas.  Will try rolling thinner. but heeded the warning not to roll too thin... Mine are soft and fairly flexible.. Gonna go slap some cheese and salsa on some....

These were good and easy to make.  It was my first try at making tortillas and they came out good, the hardest issue for me was knowing when to flip them while cooking and I did have a bit of a hard time rolling but I tack that up to my inexperience in making them.  I will definitely make these again.

These turned out great and were so easy to do! Mine cracked a little so they didn't always make perfect circles when I rolled them out. I'm just going to spray cooking spray over the tops of the balls when I let them sit.

I made these ahead of time for an enchillada recipe and they were great when they came straight off the pan but after a while they became so stiff that when I tried to roll the enchillada sauce in them they broke. However no one noticed this since they were smothered in taco sauce and MEGA CHEESE! lol. I'm going to try to roll them thinner next time, maybe that will help. Thanks!

Good recipe, wish I had used only white flour though because whole wheat... well, it tastes like whole wheat flour. :P  Also I'll have to figure a way to make those buggers ROUND!  But overall, I'm really glad of the way they turned out and I'll make them again - with just white flour.  Thanks a bunch.  Oh yes and if the dough seems flaky, just add a bit of water and knead in about half a teaspoon of white flour to prevent it from getting too sticky.

Loved it!  I cut the recipe in 1/2,  used canola oil and 1/2 the salt and they were super!  Will definitely put this into rotation for our weekly meals.  Would be great as burritos, wraps, quesadillas, plain as a snack.  Very tasty!

This was my first attempt at making tortillas, and they were fantastic!!  After reading some reviews, I substituted the shortening with olive oil.  I can't wait to go out and buy a tortilla press, which will make the recipe go so much faster.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

This recipe is a keeper in my book!  Like others said, I may never go back to store bought tortillas again!  I quartered the recipe since I was only making them for quesadillas and I only had all-purpose flour, (though I wish I had wheat). I let this sit for the minimum time of an hour.  They were so thin and soft, yum!  My quesadillas turned out great! THANKS!

This recipe was superb. Unlike the other recipe for tortillas those tortillas stayed soft after cooking. And they tasted great as well. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I made them once with olive oil and whole wheat, and again with butter and all white flour.  Great both times!  Oh, and I don't know what kind of difference it made, but I did add 1/2 tsp baking soda as suggested by another reviewer.

Tastes much better than store bought tortillas.

Great recipe! Everyone loved them. I couldn't even stop eating them plain! They do taste a bit fatty with all the shortening so I think I will try Olive oil next time as someone else recommened.

I will give this recipe 5 stars for the taste,texture and ease of preparation. I followed this to a tee and was pleasantly surprised how well they turned out. The only problem I experienced was it did not take as long in my cast iron skillet to "cook" them. Some areas came out a little to dark but that may have been my skillet. I prepard these to make fajitas which were delicious. Overall they were easy to make and I will definately make again. May even invest in a tortilla press!

These are very very good.  Definetly a lot better than the plastic tasting tortillas that you buy at the chain grocery store. I used olive oil and added 1 tsp baking powder otherwide following recipe exactly.  I am Mexican/American and grew up eating home made tortillas so I have had better. Will make again.

These tortillas didn't turn out quite right for me, (although it had absolutely nothing to do with the recipe as I had to make some weird flour substitutions!) and yet they were a million times more flavorful and stored better than anything I've ever bought in a store or at a restaurant! Definite keeper.

Loved this recipe! I used 3 cups of wheat and 2 all-purpose flour and substituted canola oil for shortening. They really turned out wonderfully - very soft with a good flavor. I had no problems with them and had fun cooking them with my three-year-old!

I also used olive oil in place of shortening, and I only made a third of the recipe.  I think next time I will add more water, because the dough was too crumbly to work with.  It might be worthwhile to make the whole recipe and then just freeze them because it is tedious to roll all of them out.

I guess I'm too much of a gringa!  I couldn't get them rolled out much bigger than 5-6 inches across. Then as soon as it hits the heat from the pan, it shrinks even more.  The taste was fine, for thick, flour"y" tortillas.  I'm sure if done properly it would be wonderful, but until I have some "authentic" help, I'm gonna stick to store bought.

Before I found this recipe I used to have to ask my mother for her recipe, which she could never remember, whenever I wanted to make tortillas. Now I can just use this recipe which is healthier. I use Smart Balance shortening, stone ground whole wheat flour and sometimes bread flour for the AP when I run out. I usually make 1.5 ounce dough balls so I end up with about 24 tortillas.
