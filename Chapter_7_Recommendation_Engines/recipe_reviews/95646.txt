This recipe doesn't have to be so difficult!  Just wrap the hot dogs with bacon (secured with toothpicks).  Lay wraps in a single layer (if you have too many, use another pan for the rest).  Then mix a box of brown sugar with enough water to make it "pourable" (not too thin) and pour over the entire lot.  Bake until the bacon is done.  Remove immediately as the sauce hardens.

I have been making these for a few years now and everone loves them. I, however, use the mini sausages instead of hotdogs. Use on foil lined pan for easier cleanup.

Folks, I've been making these for decades.  You simply need to wrap the hotdogs in the bacon, secure with toothpicks and put directly into the slowcooker.  Dump the brown sugar on top, cover and cook it.  The bacon renderings mix with the sugar.  No need to dissolved anything, bake first, or mess up more than one pan.  The longer they cook, the better they taste!  They're even good after the hotdogs shrivel up although they don't look all that appetizing.

Good simple recipe, but so much better when made with Lil' Smokies (cocktail weiners).  Everyone loves them!

I made 132 of these tasty little things for my daughter's college graduation party last week. They were snatched up so fast I barely got a taste. We made them, as someone else suggested, by cutting the bacon in thirds, rolling the Li'l Smokies up and laying them on the seam. I baked them ahead of time in the oven then put them in the crockpot to keep warm until serving. To serve, I placed them in a chafing dish (I needed something a little fancier than the crockpot)They stayed rolled up and toothpicks weren't needed to secure them. Easy to make and a real hit!!

These would rate higher if the bacon was partially precooked (to avoid so much fat mixed with the brown sugar sauce), & if the hot dogs were something smokey-flavored, like maybe L'il Smokies. I made a single layer, with the toothpicks standing up. I also spooned the brown sugar sauce over the appetizers part way through baking. I only made these because I had to use up some hot dogs, & had the oven cooking other foods. I won't ever make them again, unless I happen to have L'il Smokies.

I always use little smokies . Almost always put together the night before since they are time consuming then bake just before serving time . longer they marinate , the saucier the sugar gets . I would NOT even think of adding water to the sugar , nor would I use whole hot dogs ! The guys around here love them just as I have said ! Oh & the thicker your bacon , the longer the bake time !

This is good-I use the cocktail weiners and wrap them in bacon and broil them for 3 minutes or so.  Delicious and the brown sugar caramelizes beautifully!

I brought these to a party, and it took awhile to get people to try them- but once they did, these little treats were a BIG hit! I used lil' smokies instead of cocktail weiners, and i just threw the bacon wrapped dogs in a dish, and dumped the brown sugar over the whole thing. I stirred them well while baking, so everything got covered. GREAT RECIPE, i never would have thought to combine this myself!

so easy and so yummy!  I've now made this twice and definitely on the keeper list!  Used two packages of little smokies which took 1 lb of bacon + 3 strips.  Used 3 cups of sugar which was too much!  That quantity was really too much for a 9x13 pan - I had to crank up the oven heat and bake for longer.  Took off the foil for the last 5 min to help crisp up the bacon bit more.

I used Little Smokies, and this was a big hit, even with people who normally watch their diet very closely. I cut the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups and baked them 60 minutes. Thank you for the great recipe, Lydia!

These are very good, I would say  more on a casual setting, but simple and fun. And it's something you can throw together if you want a quick munchie.

These have been dubbed the "weinie situation" in our family.  I took them to a housewarming then had to leave to pick my son up from wrestling practice.  When I left, the guest of honor hadn't arrived yet and no one was eating.  When I returned twenty minutes later these yummy dogs were almost gone.  The hostess, my daughter in law, had directed everyone to the food items and just said "and over there is a weinie situation".  LOL!  Ten people and I doubled the recipe.  Gone in no time.  Having Christmas dinner with my son and daughter in law tonight.  These were requested. I use all beef hot dogs and uncover the pan and turn the heat up to 400 degrees for an additional fifteen minutes to thicken up the sauce.

I agree!  I have been using this recipe for years.  They go quick and you have to keep them coming out of the oven.  For a shortcut, I have made them ahead of time and nuked them when needed.  Also the cocktail wienies work very well too!

I made these for a New Year's Eve party. Everyone but my husband liked them. He thought they were too sweet and suggested I reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup.  Haven't tried his suggestion yet.

Superb!  I like to use little smokies instead of hotdogs - they look a more presentable.  I'm always asked for the recipe, and people can't believe how easy it is to make.

Delicious! Baked them for several get-togethers and they were demolished in minutes. Extremely tasty and definitely an excellent party food!

I made this a meal and my kids loved it. I wrapped 8 whole hot dogs with one piece of bacon each and followed the rest of the recipe.

OMG!! These are THE best! I have to be careful when I make these, or I could easily eat the whole panful. Took this to cookout and everyone raved! My boss's husband only wants these now when he's watching football. Will have to try with little smokies!

Mine did not turn out good at all.  I thought the hotdogs tasted rubbery and they were a soggy mess.  It could have just been me, though.

I make these all the time.  They are tasty and always a hit.  I've always called them  "Pig Dogs"  but they are good no matter what you call them.

These were ok.  Not as good as I'd hoped they would be.  The kids and hubby did NOT like them at all, so I have lots leftover.  I'll add them to my baked beans and call it a day.

We made this a day ahead of our Christmas Party.  Unfortunately for us, we ate HALF of them when they came out of the oven.

There weren't enough left to put in a crockpot, so I warmed them up in a baking dish for the party!  They were gone within minutes!!

This one is a keeper!

Easy to make.  They didn't last long. I used hotdogs and sausage.
