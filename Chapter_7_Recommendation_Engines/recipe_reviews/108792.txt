My husband is from Veracruz Mexico, and has been making this for years.  We all love it, and I am glad to see it here.  He uses all the ingedients listed, plus adds clamato juice and fine chopped onion. Great Recipe!!! Thank you for listing it!!

This is delicious and was loved by all both times that i served it. The 2nd time I used 1/3 C. ketchup, 1/3 C. chili sauce, and 1/3 C. orange soda for the sauce and added a little finely chopped onion and a couple extra shrimp - EVEN BETTER!

I was looking for a recipe similar to ceviche and when I came across this I thought it sounded good. I made it for a Mexican Fiesta themed 40th birthday party! I made it exactly as written and it was delicious! Everyone enjoyed it and they were so surprised when I told them about the orange soda and ketchup sauce. Low cal, healthy too!

Intrigued by the orange pop and ketchup mixture I had to try this recipe. I don't know if "bunches" of cilantro are a different size elsewhere, but I used under half a bunch and it was overwhelming.

Fantastic!  I made this last night, adding the jalapenos as suggested.  This was a great summer side dish, nice and light and with a kick.  I will definitely make this again.

This so simple to make, and quite tasty. However, I added some chopped onion and tomato to give it a little more interest and flavor.

This was really good and tasted so fresh! I added some thinly sliced red onion and a little bit of lime juice. I actually made this the night before I needed it omitting the avocado and then chopping it and mixing it in right before serving. Delicious!

I was glad to see this recipe with orange drink, however, I suggest you use Jarritos Orange Drink to make it authentic.  The secret is:  Don't just use the combination of Orange Drink and Ketchup in the recipe...start with the Orange Drink and slowly add Ketchup until the mixture doesn't taste like Orange Drink or Ketchup.  Different Orange Drink and Ketchup products have different tastes and you could end up with it tasting too much like either one.

When I first read that this recipe called  for orange soda, I thought it was so weird, but I happened to have some on hand, so I thought why not? Well, as soon as I tried it, I was immediately taken to my childhood visits to my grandparents house in Tijuana Mexico, and eating shrimp cocktails on the corner seafood stand! This is what I remember a shrimp cocktail tasting like. So great1 Thanks so much for sharing!

This is better than any other recipes I've found for this.  It is sweet because of the orange soda but really good.  It has no kick unless you add hot sauce and/or peppers but I don't like spicy hot because it burns my tongue.  I used less cilantro and I added diced tomatoe and cucumber.  I served this to my sister and mother who had never had it before.  They thought it was great.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as directed. It’s too sweet, and nothing like the shrimp cocktails served at the Mexican restaurants here near the border. We did use Jarrito’s orange drink as suggested...
