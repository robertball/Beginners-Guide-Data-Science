Wow this was fantastic! I made it for a BBQ last night as I thought it would be something unexpected and less likely to be duplicated. I was right! I like to make a new recipe exactly as it's written to give an accurate review, but I did use fat free sour cream and light mayo (I'm trying to drop a few pounds) and it was so creamy you wouldn't have guessed it was healthy. There was just the right amount of wet ingredients so it wasn't dry and there were so many textures with the olives and corn and beans! My taste test turned into a bowl of it before the BBQ and everyone raved about it. I am making this again next week for another BBQ and I will try not to eat it all before hand! Thanks so much for the recipe!

What a pretty pretty dish.  I doubled it and loved it.  I think my guest will really like it tomorrow for our taco dinner.  Thanks for sharing.

Thank you for trying my recipe and for your reviews. The salad is somewhat soupy at first; when I submitted this recipe I believe I stated "best when made a day ahead, to allow flavors to blend). The macaroni will absorb some of the dressing and will no longer be soupy. When I create a recipe I try to take into consideration who will be eating the food. This recipe, as written, is intended for the majority of people, with average tolerance for spicy/seasoned food. Not everyone can tolerate highly spiced/seasoned food; for those who can, they can easily add additional spices and seasonings to suit their taste. I always encourage others to add or omit ingredients to a recipe, to suit their individual tastes.  Get creative, that’s what makes cooking fun! :-) UPDATE: I just realized I listed the wrong sized can of sliced Black Olives... it should be a 4.25 oz can, not the 6oz can. I notified Allrecipes about the error and they have corrected the recipe, sorry for the error.

WOW! This pasta salad is great! Served it for Father's Day and it was well received. What a welcome change from regular pasta salads. As people tasted it, you could see the look of surprise on their faces... no one expected a pasta salad with zip and a lot of people went back for seconds. The medium salsa was perfect for most tastes, I don't think I would use a hot salsa. Wish I had doubled the recipe, because I love this salad and would have liked to have leftovers for myself and to send home with others... lol Several people asked for the recipe; always a good feeling when you're cooking for others.

I coordinated a Mexican / Southwest themed tailgate party and made this salad. The only change I made was omitting the olives.  It was easy to make and very good!  I might add a little more "spice" the next time I make it.

This pasta salad did not turn out well, but I was able to save it by doing the following: 4x the amount of spices listed, 2 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp each taco seasoning, salt and pepper, 1 whole red and green pepper, one whole red onion, 1 tsp Sriracha hot sauce.  After I made the "sauce" mixture of spices, mayo and sour cream, I only used half, as even with all the additional veggies half the sauce mixture was PLENTY.  Also I used 1 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup mayo (instead of the other way around as the recipe said, TOO much mayo).  Will NOT make again.

All I can say is FABULOUS! I did not have cilantro and added maybe only 1/2 the olives. Just a pinch of cayenne. Not a waist watchers but so yummy!

I made this exactly as directed. After it was finished I decided it needed more red bell pepper, more onion and more cilantro. It did not turn out as well as the other reviews said it would. Will not make this again.

I just made a half-batch of this for my small family in anticipation of tonight's dinner, and it's very good; I imagine it will be even tastier after resting in the fridge all day. I gave it four stars because I did tweak it a quite a bit.  I'm very much a taste-as-i-go cook, so I upped the cumin quite a bit, added cayenne for some extra heat, added chopped grape tomatoes and a hefty handful of chopped cilantro. I could eat a huge portion of this, but to save on calories, I plan to serve on a bed of greens with some diced cooked chicken added in. I'll definitely make this again, and maybe add some diced jalapeno for even more zip. I never thought of making a pasta salad with a Mexican twist--thanks so much for sharing.

Great recipe. I took some other suggestions and added some tomato and shredded cheese.  I left out the onion b/c I can't eat it, sour cream and black olives b/c I didn't have either and hubby doesn't like them. I wanted to make this a main dish so I added some ground soy burger crumbles and more black beans. I added more garlic powder and put in onion powder in lieu of onions.  It was delish!

I made this for the first time and took it to a group potluck. It was a big hit. My family was delighted to get the leftovers. The only revision I made was to add about a cup and a half of shredded taco cheese. For lack of having them, the green onions were replaced with 1/3 cup sweet onion chopped fine. I will definitely be making this again and will experiment with the addition of chopped Roma tomatoes (seeded), more cheese, chopped jalapeno peppers, and more chunky salsa, plus more cumin and cilantro. Very good!!!

I just made this for Memorial Day party. I wanted it to be more like a meal so I added diced cooked chicken and cheese chunks. I also used diced fresh garlic and diced fresh cilantro instead of dry. One last alteration I did was add fresh squeezed lime and lemon juice to add extra freshness. It's amazing!

This was a huge hit, even with my daughter, who doesn't like pasta salads.  I put in a good handful of fresh cilantro, I think  it adds a fresher, brighter taste.

This recipe turned out great exactly as printed.  I have made it several times.  It is a nice change of pace from other pasta salads.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers did wrong.  When you make the dressing, it does seem soupy, but have no fear!  If you let it chill for several hours or over night, it sets up perfect.  This recipe is also good with chopped fresh cilantro.  Give it a try!!

I tried this before adding the mayo and I love it just like that!  Going to wait and see if I think it needs it after sitting a while, but I love all of these flavors together.

I don't like things spicy so if i'm just making this for myself, I don't add extra seasoning expect for maybe taco seasoning.  I also am not crazy about mayo so I only use half a cup.  I love it and can feed off of it for days!

Made this for the annual 4th of July cookout/potluck and it was a hit!  People were going back for seconds and even thirds.  I meant to make recipe exactly as is, but I forgot the cilantro and it wasnt missed, and the can of olives I bought was smaller than the recipe called for.  I think it would have been too many olives if I had bought what was called for.  The only other change I would make would to be to add more of the red bell pepper. I will be making this again soon-it was so easy and yummy!  Thanks for the recipe Joslyn!

I really enjoyed this twist on pasta salad.  Some people stated it was soupy, mine on the other hand was the opposite.  After sitting overnight, it was kind of dry, so I mixed up some more dressing.  I also doubled the spices and added more black beans.  I switched the amounts of mayo and sour cream and I only had frozen corn and fresh cilantro.  Will make again!

perhaps I had too high hopes for this recipe, but I was a little disappointed.  I generally like to try a recipe 'as is' the first time around, but for this recipe, I regret not having applied some of the suggestions offered by those who were critical.  there was so much sauce that the pasta seemed runny and it was not as flavorful as I'd hoped.  if I make this again, I would cut the mayo and sour cream in half, and maybe double the spices.

This is a very good recipe - looks lovely and tastes good. I am giving 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I had only a 12oz box of pasta and was concerned about the soupy consistency noted by others since I did not have time to chill overnight to set. So I cut the mayo (light), sour cream (light), and salsa (hot) in half but left the spices the same. I also omitted the olives and added fresh cilantro and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. Will definitely make again.

This was good. I used about 1/2 light sour cream and 1/2 mayo, and I left out the bell pepper simply because I didn't have one on hand. I also used fresh cilantro rather than dried. I would have liked a little more flavor, so next time I would up the spices, but we enjoyed this. Thank you!

Great recipe! Tips: 1/ add more diced red peppers if you want to make it more colourful and more importantly, for more texture in the salad); 2/ my salsa was really spicey so I just put in the ground pepper and not the cumin and it was perfect; 3/ don't put all the mayo and sour cream at once -put in half, stir your mixture and think about how creamy/fatty you want it, because I used the recomm'd amount and it was too creamy for my personal taste; 4/ ran out of olives, but it was still good--next time might throw in some tuna?  I brought this to a southern bbq themed dinner and it went well with the corn bread and bbq chicken.

Good salad.  Not sure if it would make it again as it didn't hold well after the second day.

Prepared it the night before serving at a potluck. Only changes were 1/2 Tbs. fresh cilantro minced  instead of 1/2 tsp. of dried. And I added half the amount of salt. Received many compliments and requests for the recipe. Also my vegetarian friends loved it.

First, I must apologize that I've not taken time to offer a review on this before now.  I made this 3 or 4 years ago for Thanksgiving dinner and it was such a hit that it became my 'bring along' dish for pot-luck get-togethers.  Over time, I made substitutions -- I use veggie pasta, plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, lite mayo, and mild salsa.  I've not calculated the nutritional changes but it makes us feel less guilty and pleases my health-conscious husband.  It's fast, it's easy, and it's inexpensive and I've not had anyone dislike it yet.  My husband took it to a luncheon at the office yesterday and had several ask for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this with us!

I made the salad as recipe states, the only change being that I used pinto beans because I didn't have any black beans.  I didn't care for it at all, almost no taste other than the onions and olives. Maybe add some taco seasoning or chili powder?  Don't know, but I won't make it again as is.  I like the idea of the Mexican flavors and was hoping for something with some heat and zip (I used medium salsa) but if I make again will add my own spices and maybe some fresh cilantro, couldn't taste the dried in it at all.

It was very good.  I made it for teacher appreciation lunch and it was the hit of the day, there wasn't any left overs.  I let it set overnight and omitted the olives. Easy and quick to make.

All around solid recipe. Pretty quick to put together with ingredients I typically have on hand.  I now prefer this over a classic macaroni salad. Makes the first cook out of the season a smashing success!

This is really good. I followed the recipe mostly to the letter, though I improvised on the ratio of mayo to sour cream and I think it was about half-and-half; and instead of salsa, I just chopped up a tomato. Added a can of green chiles as well, since no salsa.  It's delicious and several people at the luncheon I took it to commented on it. Yum!

Very good.  I've made it twice.  Once as directed and the second time I used a pack of ranch dressing mix (omitting the salt), switched around the mayo and sour cream ratio (since I was nearly out of mayo).  Subbed some veggies I had for some I didn't and it turned out really nice.   Both ways are good.  The ranch dressing mix did rid the salad of the overly mayo/sour cream taste.  I think the most important part is the salsa so make sure to use a good one!

A big hit with most of the family.  Next time I will add more black beans, use only 1/2 cup mayo and add 3/4 to 1 cup of sour cream to get right consistency.

This is excellent!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Something different from the normal pasta salads.  Even my husband who normally wont eat any pasta salad with mayonaise is raving about it.  I made this for a cookout tomorrow, but may not have any to take by then!!  Thank you for sharing:)
