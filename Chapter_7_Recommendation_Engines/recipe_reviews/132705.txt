I made these using twice the amount of orange exract called for and it was delicious!  I baked for 8-10 minutes.  Any more than that and they can burn.

These are okay but rather forgettable. They won't be the first to disappear from your cookie tray and no one will be still talking about them 6 months later.  They're basically a butter/sugar cookie, certainly not the best I've ever had, not quite sweet enough with a mildly mild citrus flavor (I made a lime variation), that are basically short on flavor - citrus, butter or otherwise - and I even used a tad more extract.  I think a little salt and vanilla would have done wonders to  make the flavors come alive - or maybe a glaze made of powdered sugar and juice.  They're a very plain looking cookie too, which I could live with if the cookie itself was knock-out delicious.

I did not sift the sugar, so that may be why my cookies came out rather crumbly. I also added some orange juice in place of orange zest. I really like the flavor of these cookies--citrus-y and not too sweet. With other modifications, perhaps, I will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly, and I have to say I wasn't wowed.  These make decent butter cookies, but not very orangey.  I would add more orange extract next time.  They are really simple to make, going together really quick.

As others suggested, I double the orange extract to 2 t and also went a bit heavy on the grated orange zest.  The cookies have a good flavor and are a nice break from the "old standards" cookies.

Made this for Christmas. Easy to make and soft, but I would have preferred a more orangey taste. I'm going to try it with more orange extract.

after reader the other reviews I added twice the amount of extract.  They are soft tender and really do just melt in your mouth.  I can't wait to try this recipe with some lemon or lime!!!!

These were good, but my first attempt resulted in what tastes like a typical sugar cookie, and a bit more crisp than I would expect from the title (meltaway). I wish I would have read the reviews before making them. I couldn't really taste the orange and will likely double the extract and try one more time.
