This is my first ever recipe review, and I took a chance on a new recipe with no reviews. I was not disappointed at all. These cookies are very easy to make and they turned out exactly as pictured. This is a firm shortbread pecan sandy type cookie. I halved the recipe and added about 2 Tbsp of flour due to high altitude but I'm not sure it was necessary...mostly it's out of habit. I also had leftover prepared caramel for apple dipping so I substituted that for the caramels and cream. Taste was great, but I'm betting the real caramels and cream are even better. I also baked these on parchment for easy clean up. Thanks for posting... I look forward to making more!

There are a couple of things that should be clarified in the recipe: butter should be softened. And press with a spoon after they come out of the oven cause obviously they will be hot to touch. Overall the process wasn’t too bad. They came out really good and I’m not a huge sweets fan. Nor do I really love caramel, but I am making these for someone else. My 11 year old loved them. I did half pecan rolled and half almond rolled, because I thought I had enough pecans. Wrong. Oh well. Both came out very good. Recommend drizzling the chocolate with a fork. I tried a spoon and got globs. #notabaker

These were pretty darn good.  The only issues I had, were they seemed to have a heavy flour taste and I didn't have near enough pecans.  I think I will cut the flour down next time I make these (and, trust me, there will be a next time!).  Re-reading this recipe before I reviewed it, I realized I forgot to add in the oil to the chocolate chips.  Didn't even miss it, so, not sure if it is really necessary.  This is a keeper for sure!

These cookies are good, but do require some work.  As such, I will probably only make for special occasions...which will make them all the more special when I do.

Brought this to a potluck we had at work.  Was a big hit.  Got a few Skype messages, emails, etc, from other staff members saying how great they were and asking if I can share the recipe!  
The only issue I had is that, I think the receipe say it would make 48 cookies?  No way, I made the ball relatively small (maybe one inch) and I probably ended up with somewhwere between 32 and 36 cookies (didn't actually count).  I had a couple myself and I love them.   Definitely will make again!

Helps to watch the video to see how the spoon is used to create a larger thumbprint for the caramel.

I love these!! I did use twice the pecans and 1 less egg mixed with about 1/4 cup of water. I also forgot the salt, but since there is salt on the caramel it didn’t seem to make a difference.

Made these for the neighbors for Christmas and got rave reviews and one recipe request.  
Next time I would add a little less flour; more nuts; one bag of 36 caramels is plenty and I used my 1 1/2" cookie scoop and I got about 30 cookies.

Delicious! Family loved these. Next time I will make them smaller. Also, I needed double the amount of nuts!

very very yum!! The cookie dough was a big dry and crumbly so i added some milk to the dough and mixed it up again. I would definitely make these again as they hit the spot!

I'm not usually much of a shortbread cookie fan, but this recipe is delicious! It stays together better than most shortbread recipes. Be sure to be a bit aggressive when making the indentation— my only complaint was that my indentations didn't hold, so the caramel spilled over.

I love shortbread style cookles and these may be the most delicious cookie I have ever tasted! However..... 1) it doesn't take much salt to give the yummy salted caramel flavor, 2) double or triple the finely chopped pecans, and 3) THIS IS A LOT OF WORK! Worth it but a 2-3 hour project!

Recipe was followed as written. They turned out just like the photo but my family and I rated them just ‘ok’. I don’t think this is the fault of the recipe, I think we just don’t enjoy the dry shortbread type cookie. I knew that going in, but thought the caramel would save them.

Not sure of these, but I make similar ones at Christmas every year and they are absolutely my fave. I call them Turtle Thumbprints though and the cookie is chocolate, not shortbread.
