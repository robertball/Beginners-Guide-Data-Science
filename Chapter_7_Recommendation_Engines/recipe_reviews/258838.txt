Was a fast and easy cookie with tasty results - however, I did make changes, so i couldn't honestly critique based on the original recipe, but the base ingredients were just what i was looking for:  easy, not too much sugar or butter.

My recipe:
(all the base recipe ingredients)
minus the nuts.
I added a splash of vanilla, so maybe one teaspoon.
added 1 cup of quick oats to thicken the batter.
Added mini chocolate chips on top for additional, optional flavor.

Still baked them at 325 degrees, but dropped 1 rounded tablespoon on an insulated cookie sheet, on parchment, for 15 minutes.  When taken out of the oven, I left them on the cookie sheet for an additional 10 minutes before removing to a rack for cooling.

These were incredibly moist, soft and fluffy.  I will definitely be making these again (possibly in lieu of an actual banana bread!)

Very good, almost a cross between a muffin and a cookie.

Delicious and simple! I subbed greek yogurt for half of the butter (so, 2 tablespoons of greek yogurt and 2 tablespoons of butter). Sprinkled oats on top too for a nice touch!

My mom had a similar recipe. They were always my kids favourites. they looked forward to them every time we visited. My dad suggested I started making them. They are a hit. I made these several times now. Kids do not like the sprinkled sugar on top but I do toss in a 1/4 of chocolate chips. They don’t last long.

Easy recipe! I added vanilla, cinnamon, and a few white chocolate chips. I also substituted hazelnuts for the walnuts because that’s what was in the pantry! This batter recipe is really flexible and can easily handle adding banana-friendly flavours like chocolate.

Yum, it's a debate whether this is a cookie or muffin top! It is light, fluffy and delicious. 
I did add vanilla and oatmeal and choc chips to the mix. 
Definitely a keeper!

This is the fluffiest fastest cookies I have ever made!  I like that you can use 2 or 3 bananas if you like, and that you can add nuts or chocolate chips to the mix.  I have made these cookies twice and have stopped making banana bread because these cookies are so good!  Highly recommend this recipe!

I made these cookies with my grandkids. They were so easy to make and came out great! Very fluffy and soft. We added chocolate chips and red and green sugar on top for Christmas! They’re a hit with the whole family!!

Absolutely phenomenal!  I reduced the sugar a bit, and omitted the sugar topping cause I just felt a bit lazy. I replaced walnuts with chocolate chips that I hand stirred in after mixing everything else. This will be my new go-to recipe when I have leftover bananas (which is like every other week!). So easy and fast, not to mention delicious!

Used 3 bananas, gluten free flour, walnuts and 1/3 cup chocolate chips, and 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Delicious!

Easy recipe to whip up in no time. Tastes like a muffin and hit the spot for that banana muffin/banana bread taste with very little work and clean up. I substituted greek plain yogurt and olive oil for the butter (2T of each) since I was out of butter and that substitution worked fine, although I did have to add an extra 1/2 c flour. Also added a dash of nutmeg.

Great recipe. Always looking for overripe banana recipes and this one is a keeper. Though great as is this is my lower fat/calorie version. I replaced the butter with apple sauce and cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup. (89 cal AC/DC to MyFitnessPal) No sugar on top. The walnuts would have terrific in, but alas allergies in the family mean if we want to share they have to be omitted.

Love this simple recipe.  My daughter likes me to add extra bananas so that they are heavy and moist.  Otherwise they are fluffy and light.  Great both ways :)

These are really good. I didn't add nuts and I substituted coconut oil for butter. I suggest putting your batter in the fridge for 15 minutes before baking they turned out wonderful! These are really soft, they actually remind me of muffin tops. Thank you so much for such an easy recipe!

What easy and delicious recipe. I put in some vanilla in the batter. I saw a post, so I decided to use it. I don’t know if anyone does this, but I put my cookies in a container with bread in it. It stays soft not hard!! I do it with all my cookies  I’m adding this recipe for my Christmas list!!!!

We used 3 bananas, because we had 3 going back. Also, added a splash of vanilla, because we just did. These were a hit! My 7 year old was able to help make them all and he was eating them up. They have that great banana flavor and we loved the walnuts. They are light and airy like bread. Will make again!
