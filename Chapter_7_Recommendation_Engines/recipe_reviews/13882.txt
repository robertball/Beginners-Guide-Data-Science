Complex flavors. very good. I sliced one boneless skinless chicken breast really thin (stir-fry style). a little oil in pan and I stir-fried chicken and then proceeded with the recipe- used a very large jalapeno as my pepper- did not have fresh limes, so I used 2 tbls. of key lime juice-added extra cilantro (love that stuff)- will make again.. thanks

I was a little leery of adding tomatoes, but I went ahead and did it.  This soup is so good!  It's a great mixture of sweet and hot and just right.  I served it with rice same as I would dal, and I can't wait to make it for Janmastami!  Almost effortless and super quick on the stovetop.  I think kids would love this recipe as it isn't too hot (though you could add more peppers-I used a jalapeno!) and it mingles with the rice in just the right way.  Super!! Haribol!

This soup is delicious! I added one maggi chicken stock cube and left out the salt. I also did not add as much lime as the recipe calls for and not as much water.
One can add a little coconut milk if one desires, but it's equally good without it.
Will definately make this soup again!

This is a little salty but I liked it.
It is an easy recipe for when you dont have many ingredients in the cupboard!
I served it with rice and I think next time I will add tofu, scallions, and rice noodles. It is an interesting recipe ...

oooooo a challenge. so here's what i did. i put the pepper, pineapple, ginger, cilantro, and lime in the blender. i used coconut milk instead of water and pureed it all. then i warmed the oil in a pot and added the soup; then added two teaspoons roasted red pepper chili paste and two tablespoons peanut butter, and heated until melted. i actually am sick, and had been looking forward to trying this recipe. i'm giving four stars because of all the modifications, but i know i'll make this again. this time i threw in some crab, but next time i'll probably add some tofu. i really agree with all the other reviews -- give this a try and modify to taste. it's worth it!

wow.  this soup was awesome.  i love the spicy/sweet contradiction, and the acidity level was just right.  i used half water and half coconut milk, starting with the milk, and eased up on the cumin.  don't be frightened by the tomatoes; they're a nice addition!

The flavor is interesting, but lacks the zing expected after reading the write-up.  Additionally, crushed pineapple was not as apealing as pineapple chunks.

Well, being an American I found the soup to be a bit too salty and too sweet. I know, that comment was rather "Iron Chef" of me but it's true. It was not that bad but it was a little like drinking Indian salsa. I might try it again and play doctor with it.

This soup is better when pureed in small (very small) batches. I used less water too.

I'm sorry this had absolutely no flavor. In the end I doubled the pineapple and added 1 can of coconut milk. Thank fully I did not add the cilantro which would have really killed the flavor.

This recipe intrigued me...had to try it.  Yum!!!  I will definitely make this again.  I used chicken broth for the liquid and added canned shredded chicken.  Absolutely addictive blend of flavors...Love it!!!

I love this soup! So flavorful and spicy and easy to make. I did add a tablespoon of honey to balance some very juicy limes, I will make this again.

Wow, easy, quick and a lot of different flavors.  I made as written, only I used a fresh pineapple that I chunked and ruffly crushed. The spice of my pepper at first was overwhelming but as time went on it melded well with the pineapple, and ginger. Cooked longer then recipe called for.I did go ahead and add the tomato, I recommend it. I juiced only 1 lime and served slices with the soup for dinners to squeeze as they please. Served this over rice noodles with wonton chips on the side.

This is one of my family's favorites. It is especially good when you have a cold! I always have to at least double the recipe because it goes so fast, even with just 3 people eating it.

This is good but I felt needs something more. I used chicken broth instead of water and it was still a little lacking. It's a good start to a nice broth-y soup! Not sure why it had to boil and not boil over and over.

My changes to this recipe made it absolutely wonderful.   Here's what you should add to your ingredient list:   1 red bell pepper (julienned)  1/2 yellow onion (chopped)  3 cloves of garlic (minced)  1 zucchini (quartered)  1/4 cup coconut milk  1 vegetable bouillon cube instead of the salt that the recipe calls for    I also doubled the ginger/pepper/cumin mix (because you need to add more liquids to account for the extra veggies) and I left out the tomatoes.    Begin by sauteing the onion and garlic and then add the bell pepper and zucchini--saute for a few minutes.    Add 1 cup of water, ginger/pepper/cumin mix, pineapple and veggie bouillon cube--stir and bring to boil.    Add half of the coconut milk and bring to a boil again.  Add as much more water is desired for your soup--I added another cup, brought it to a boil.  Then add the remaining coconut milk.    I always taste my food as I go along.  For me, it needed more salt so I added a little bit and I like spice so I added a little cayenne pepper.     The soup turned out really good and I would highly recommend my version!  I can't imagine this soup without the veggies--it seems it would be a bit boring.    Enjoy my Thai inspired version!

Easy, Yes.  I'm not sure how this recipe is anyone's idea of delicious, tho'. I followed the recipe but left out the cilantro and tomato.  When it was done, at first taste, tasted like chunky hot salad dressing.  Then following some recommendations, I added 1/2 can lite coconut milk and about 1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut.  Better, but still not good.  The I added 1/2 can of Amy's cream of tomato soup and it GREATLY improved, surprisingly!  I was going to dump it but now I'll let my family at least try it.  You never know.

I have made this soup about three times and loved it, even though I did it a little different each time.  Ive substituted salsa for the tomato, also used tomato soup concentrate, and subbed lemon for lime.  I really like this soup, but it does have a lot of really strong flavors.  Probably not for unadventurous eaters.

I would give this recipe a higher rating for uniqueness if I could, but it was just not very "WOW" as a stand-alone soup.  I ended up doubling the ginger in the recipe because I didn't think it was strong enough in the amount called for in the recipe.  I agree with previous ratings that it is just missing something.  I love that it was so simple to make, and I will be making it again, but I think next time I will be adding about 2T. of peanut butter in the second step, as well as garnish with sliced green onions...I think these modifications would give it a little more Pineapple Pad Thai flare.  I will add later whether these modifications made much difference.  Overall, great recipe, but needs some modifications according to the tastes of the cook :o)

I modified this recipe a lot. Thats the reason I am giving it a 3. I added one cup of diced baby carrots, two stalks celery, half a medium onion choped, sauteed everything with ginger garlic paste instead of just ginger. Did not add cumin seeds at the end. And ofcourse added cumin powder and fresh cilantro and it turned out great. Will definitely make it again.

I agree with another reviewer that something is just missing here.  But I think it is a great recipe, so Im rating it a 4 hoping that I figure out what is missing.  I think maybe it is too much pineapple and too little BLANK.  No idea.  I doubled the jalepeno and also purreed it when finished.  Im going to eat it tomorrow chilled and see if that fixed the mystery problem.  :-)  Good luck, I think it is worse a try. - Okay, I have been eating this non-stop since I chilled it.  It is great as a chilled pineapple soup on a hot day :-)

the citrus was too strong for my likes.  however, i used the rest of it as a marinade for tofu!  just fry up the tofu in a skillet, cover with the "soup" and bake at 350 for 15 minutes and broil for 10 minutes.  much improved!  :)

I thought this was tastey, but it lacked a lot. Hard to describe, as it had flavor, but was yet somehow still boring... I'll only make this again if I am sick and need a sinus clearing.

This was interesting.  I really liked the idea of all the flavors together and it did smell wonderful, but something about it didn't do it for me.  I think a smoother, rather than liquidy result I would have liked better - if I had pureed all the ingredients.  It might have been better with a coconut milk base rather than water.  I just had leftovers for lunch and it was really delightful - seems like the flavors needed time to come together.
