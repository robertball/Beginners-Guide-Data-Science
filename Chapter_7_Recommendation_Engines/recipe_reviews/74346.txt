I changed up the spices using celery seed, mustard seed, garlic cloves and a good amount of smoked paprika.  The smoked paprika really gives it a new flavor and I think this would be something to eat with a margarita , bbq or pork/ham.  I like it!  I could never have done it without this base recipe so thank you!
