Garlic Kale Quinoa Haiku: "A divine side dish! Just needs more than one cup kale, cuz it shrinks so much." I never thought that I'd dive into a side dish w/ as much glee as I did this one, but WOW. I'd recently (finally) finished off a monster amount of Costco's frozen bags of quinoa/kale blend, and didn't want to stuff more of them in my freezer and found this recipe instead. And I am thrilled that I did b/c it is delicious! I've since made it 3 more times, once subbing spinach for kale (just as good), once adding toasted sesame seeds (not necessary, but a nice touch), and all the more recent times, at least doubling the greens b/c they shrink down too much in the heat and we love green chow in our house. A superb, healthy side dish, and ohhhh when I run it through the food-processor a few times, my baby CHOWS DOWN! :-)

Simple, fast, delicious. I was looking for an easy quinoa recipe for a weeknight side dish and this fit the bill. We are trying to replace rice with whole grains like quinoa, and I wanted a dish that incorporated some greens as well to round out the nutritional balance. I had about a tsp of leftover diced onion and half of a diced tomato- added those in with the kale and garlic. This recipe made the perfect amount for two people. Will be making this often.

It is good, but needs a bit more garlic or salt. I'm not a cook so I appreciate the recipe. I think there is a lot of room to experiment.

Very good blend of flavors. I made exactly as the recipe stated. I might use more kale next time, but it was wonderful as is.

I substituted couscous for the quinoa because I was out of quinoa,  but the recipe still turned out great! We paired it with lemon butter chicken. Great side for the chicken!

This was good as written, but it needs something.  Maybe toasted pine nuts, or hot pepper flakes.  I'll make this again but will tweak the recipe for a bit more flavor.

This is a great super easy dish also I made it vegan.  I also toasted my quinoa in the garlic onion sun dried tomato & olive oil base then added vegan broth and kale and let it simmer. Delish!

Blah!  Needs more ingredients to pep up the flavor.  Agreed with the suggestion of chopped onion, which should be sauteed with the garlic and kale.  I used vegetable broth instead of water - chicken broth might have been better.  Something crunchy like pignolia nuts would have been good too.  As others commented - it needs more.

So simple and tasty. I added more garlic, 2 cups kale from suggestions and a few sliced mushrooms.  Will definitely use again. Thanks!

I made this dish to freeze in individual servings to take to work.  It is excellent.  I made a triple batch, which only yielded 4 lunch size servings.  I was out of straight quinoa, so I used a quinoa and sprouted rice blend which I had purchased at Costco.  It was a great choice.  I was also out of sesame oil, but used warmed up tahini instead.  Really worked great!  The use of the cold water to keep things from getting gummy really worked well.

Very quick and easy to make.  I did not have oil in my pantry.  So I used a yogurt butter to keep things moist  this was. Wry good on its own but I like to change things up and added a small Amount of 4 cheeses Mexican blend.  WOW! Flavor exploded! We are definitely having this again. It made to the keep list.

This is a great base upon which to build by adding more ingredients.

I took one reviewers advice and added red onion. Another suggested adding 4 garlic cloves instead of 1 and a big splash of red wine vinegar. Another doubled the kale. I did all of them. All rock solid choices! 

Additionally, I added chickpeas, sliced yellow bell peppers, and carrots. 

Loved it! Can't wait to experiment more with this!

I added an extra cup of kale but otherwise followed it exactly.  I was really trying to find a recipe where I can eat kale since it's so healthy but this was not it.  I don't think it's the recipe though, just the fact that my taste buds don't like kale raw or cooked.

We really liked this. I added more garlic, about 3-4 cloves, and added a big splash of red wine vinegar to the kale at the end, before adding the quinoa. Greens really do well with vinegar. Topped it off with a baked filet of mahi mahi and it was a delicious and healthy meal.

I'm in love, tried it and loved it. I did s couple things differently. Substitute chicken broth for water used to make quinoa. My 11 year old who is very picky loves. I served a garden salad an baked chicken.

I made this with extra kale and mixed quinoa. I also used chicken broth with the quinoa.  It was really good. I think that the sesame oil added  a nutty flavor that made it! I will definitely make this again.

Tasty - did not have sesame oil so omitted that and used more garlic. Had the power greens mix (baby kale, spinach and chard) from Costco.  Rather than one cup, I threw in several handfuls of that so my dish ended up being about half greens and half quinoa. Just one cup of kale wilts down to very little, so the dish would have ended up being mostly quinoa. Not that that is bad, just that I wanted more greens...

I am not a kale fan, but interested in eating different combinations as a side dish. This one  is great.  A couple of  tweaks  though, I added about 7 more garlic cloves. I think about 3 more than that should do the trick. The garlic flavor makes this a very flavorful dish. I omitted the sesame oil as well.
