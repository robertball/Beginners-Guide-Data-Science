I never had Ratatouillle before. I've made the Ratatouille Provencale recipe on Thursday night and it came out so good. I've used Rana's pappardelle pasta to add it in the end. I've passed on the shaved Parmiano-reggiano cheese since it was too expensive and used grated instead.  I would love to make this again.

Delicious and easy to make! Very filling, but healthy with all of the vegetables. I would consider adding mushrooms next time.

Tastey. Added shredded Brussel sprouts the last 5 min and a handful of greens. Prepard the zucchini as ribbon pasta and served ratatouille on top 
with lots of crushed red pepper flakes
