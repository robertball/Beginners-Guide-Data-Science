Good. I used wild caught Alaska Sockeye Salmon and 25 minutes was not enough; it took 50 minutes for the fish too cook. It was good when it was done though!

I didn't use onion but the rest of the recipe was very good and very easy. Not even much cleanup. This one goes in my current recipe file.

Followed the recipe and added a lime peel seasoning that I found online. (for fish) The combination of the dill red onion and lemon add just the right taste! Delicious and will make this again!

We quite liked it. I didn't have red onion so used a shallot. I didn't have fresh basil or dill so used basil pesto and dried dill. I cooked it in a covered corningware casserole.
