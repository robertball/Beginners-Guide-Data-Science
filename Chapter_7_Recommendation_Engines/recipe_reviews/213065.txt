This was pretty good, and I think it has potential to be fabulous, but because I kept thinking of all the changes I wished I had made, I didn't enjoy this as much as I expected to.  I love butternut squash, and was quite happy with the filling - it was light and had a nice subtle flavor, but I think the goat cheese should have been incorporated as part of the filling instead of the sauce.  I wasn't too impressed with the sauce anyway, although I didn't hate it.  My biggest dislike about it was using red onions - even after caramelizing them they still had quite a strong bite to them and it just didn't fit.  A sweeter onion would have worked nicely.  I also loved the idea of cooking the shells on a bed of spinach, but that kind of flopped for me - the spinach, of course, shrinks down so much after cooking that it was a little skimpy when served, and part of it was a little dry.    This dish was still pretty tasty - I think my issues probably have more to do with personal preference.  Next time I'm adding the goat cheese to the filling, baking the shells without the spinach and instead serving the shells on a nice plate of sauteed spinach, using a somewhat lighter sauce - maybe something with a little parmesan added - and topping with a little more goat cheese.  I think as is, this was a 3 1/2-star recipe for me, but could easily be a 5-star.  This one is well worth trying, but it just ended up being more of an inspiring meal for me as opposed to a satisfying one.

This was pretty good. I did make some changes though. I put the goat cheese in the filling and used parmesan for the sauce, I also chopped up the spinach and mixed it in with the filling. Next time I make this I'll probably make a lower fat version by not using as much butter, and using something other than cream, probably low fat or skim milk.

I gave this recipe 5 stars, but did a lot of customizing. Reading the previous reviews was helpful. I used a yellow onion instead of a red, put goat cheese in both the filling and the sauce, sauteed the spinach separately rather than put it in the baking dish, and put garlic in the sauce as well as the filling. Season with sea salt, and you have a fabulous meal!

I thought this was good, hubby didn't like it at all.  Like other reviewers, I cooked my spinach separately and wished I had cooked more.  It really makes the dish.  don't omit it!

I forgot to put in the salt, and had to add it afterwards.  That made this dish very good.  It needed more onions, and I think they should have been chopped so they were in the mixture more.

I made this with the commonly suggested modifications of a sweet yellow onion and adding goat cheese to the filling.  I used a goat cheese with honey which was great.  I also added some baby shrimp to the sauce.  Loved it!

This recipe is horrible.  The recipe was easy enough to follow and it looked nice when completed, but it tasted just awful.  If you need to find something to do with your butternut squash, stick with butternut squash soup or risotto.

This needed more salt and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, but really yummy!

This was enjoyed by multi generations-I did change it up better to suit my taste and to decrease the fat content. I used skim milk instead of cream and used a whole goat cheese package(113g) instead. I also took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled with parmesan before putting the cream/onion sauce over everything and then baking for 15 minutes or so.I also roasted the butternut squash(brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with about a Tbsp brown sugar.In the squash mash I used 5%light cream only.Pepper added to the squash mash too.Didn't use a food processor,just mashed everything in a bowl.
My 20 yr old loved it as did my parents.A definite keeper!

The sauce was very rich and the shell stuffed with butternut squash was a bit plain.  Good but maybe better seperate.

I really, REALLY liked this. All of my changes were procedural, no changes to the ingredients. I needed to boil my squash for about 20 minutes to get it soft, and I baked my shells with the sauce over them rather than add it afterwards. I loved the sweetness and tanginess of the onion with the squash, and the spinach provided a really nice base for it all.

Anyone brave and insightful enough to try this recipe is already a worthy cook and will know how to adjust. I read all the reviews and took their suggestions on using goat cheese in the filling and using a sweet onion, and more of it, as well as cooking the spinach on the side. Also, incorporated Parmesan cheese into it. So it was lovely, colorful and really delicious.

My husband and I both enjoyed this meal. I made my spinach separate & I also brought home some prosciutto to serve with it like a pumpkin ravioli dish I ate a few years back in a restaurant. I roasted my squash to keep the flavor and nutrients, plus who doesn't love that aroma filling the house? I also used cottage cheese, both because I had it and we don't care for goat cheese.
