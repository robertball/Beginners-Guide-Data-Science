So good and so easy to make. I used only 3/4 cup crushed corn flakes instead of the specified amount of 3 cups. It was enough to coat 9 chicken tenders, The timing was spot on, 10 minuets on each side and they were crunchy and a perfect golden brown. I will make these again. Thank you for the recipe.
