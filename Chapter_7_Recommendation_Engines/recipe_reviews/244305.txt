Chef John, you never disappoint! In my opinion, this is one of the best macaroni salads I've ever tasted. My favorite part is the addition of the jalapeno and poblano peppers. Don't be scared to use them. They don't make the macaroni spicy, rather they give it a whole other level of flavor. Your guests will ask what you put in it. You can definitely taste the flavor of the peppers, but not the heat. The only issue I had was that I had to add way more mayo and water than called for before serving, otherwise it was too dry. A keeper!

Today's email contained an allrecipes.com announcment that this recipe is The Most Viewed New Recipe in 2015.

Way to go Chef! 

I've made this recipe 3x, as written. Excellent each time. Like so many of your recipes, I've learned to pay attention to your instructions and let you teach me why you do things in a certain order, etc. Very helpful.

I sauteed the onions in  little butter until they slightly browned over low heat. Then I add the bell peppers, jalapeno and poblano peppers, continuing to cook over low heat until tender and tasty. Make sure to get all the seeds out of the peppers or it will be really hot. Follow the recipe as stated otherwise. Omit the Cayenne pepper as their is plenty of heat in this one already. Cubed cheese goes well in this also.

This was possibly the best macaroni salad I have ever had, and I made it. Mind blown.
The peppers give it a little spice, so if you are serving it to anyone sensitive to spice, you might want to just use bell peppers.
That being said, the spice is really not much and it compliments all the other flavors perfectly. This will be my staple mac salad for some time.

Delicious pasta salad!!  The best I've ever had!  Usually pasta salads are a bit bland, but this recipe has great texture, great crunch and wonderful flavor.  The bit of heat from the peppers, along with the crunchiness of the other veggies makes it super delicious.  Truth be told, I didn't read the entire recipe before I made it, so I made it for dinner - right before dinner.  It was warm - and I did not let it sit for 4 hours.  Family was hungry.  It was still fabulous!  I would serve cold or warm.  Very, Very good.  My sweet little family RAVED about it.  Chalk one up for mom :)  Made it with grill asparagus and honey BBQ chicken.  Yowza

So I made this huge side for a lake party I went to and everyone was very pleased with how it turned out. I thought at first the poblano and jalape√±o would be too much for the wimps there but it turned out to be perfect! I'm making it again for an end of summer bbq pool party. My friend said to add spinach next time because that's what she did to her plate but I'll leave the greens out on this one.

I guess even one tablespoon sugar was a bit much for us. Next time maybe just a pinch. But I liked the technique (making sure the pasta was completely drained and sticky to the touch before dressing), so will play around with this one.

Very yummy! I added peas, and because of where I live (Bangkok) I used a de-seeded, not very hot, Thai green chile.

This is an A-mazing macaroni salad! I made it exactly as directed, and resisted the temptation to change or add anything.  With such simple ingredients it kept for almost two weeks in the fridge. Everyone who tasted it said it was delicious. Home made macaroni salad is 1000% better than store bought so there is really no comparison. I will make this again, and again. YUMMY!

Very good! This really does taste like the mac salad that you get at the deli.  While this won't replace our favorite mac salad, this was great for a change and something I will def be make again when we want something different. Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this as written. This is the first Chef John recipe that we didn't care for. I made this for Father's Day, and sadly, it didn't go over well. My husband said it needed more dressing, and he didn't care for the peppers in it. I'm fairly sensitive to heat from peppers, and I did not find this to be too spicy. I made another quarter recipe of dressing to add to the salad for leftovers.

I confess this is the first macaroni salad I have ever made, but we loved it!  I really don't like to see when people rate a recipe on here when they have changed so many ingredients but I must admit my husband forgot to buy green onion so I did have to substitute vidalia onion since it was too late to send him back out to the store.   Other than that, everything else was exact.  We didn't find the salad too spicy at all.  It was delicious and with just the 2 of us we have been eating it every day with meals or even as a snack.  I think next time I might add 50% more veggies but I am definitely making this again and again.  Delicious!  And when I add those green onions next time I know it will be even better.  Thanks for a wonderfully delicious and easy macaroni salad.

I've made it more than a few times - sometimes I completely follow the recipe - other times, I use just mixed salad greens but i do the "sauce" that you do. I also add in a drop of horseradish, which gives it the kick that i seem to like (besides which, horseradish is good for you :D )

Excellent salad. I didn't use carrots (might in the future) but put a can of finely mixed tuna in it for protein - my mom made it like that. I also didn't  put any sugar in it. I'd  bought similar salads, including potato and coleslaw at the grocery deli a few times when I didn't have much time to cook and they were sickly sweet. I liked the tip about the water before serving it and lightly coating it with the tiny bit of dressing on the spatula.

I cant eat mayonnaise, so I appreciate a recipe with such precise measurements. Hubby and son have RAVED, son said he could have eaten just that for dinner and been happy, lol. I used a green pepper because that's what we had, and threw The parts of the green onion that looked wilted or tough into the boiling water with the noodles when they were cooking. 
Thanks again for another great recipe, Chef  John!

I made it as described, and it's perfect.  In the future I'll probably use whatever vegetables I have on hand, although I won't purposefully change anything about the recipe.  It's a winner.

Best Macaroni Salad ever!  I didn't add the hot stuff, but I did double the recipe.  I used Hellmans Mayo and Miracle Whip.  Most flavours get absorbed into the Macaroni after a few hours....not this one!  This will be my fave to make at weekend get togethers!  Thanks so much for a fabulous recipe!

I am rating this a five star because I can change it just a bit to make it more taste friendly to our tastebuds.  I followed very closely except did not use poblano chile and carrots since I did not have that on hand.  I would add that next time.  What I would definitely Not use is the mustard.  I even cut back on the mustard and we still found it almost overpowered all the other flavors.  I think using mustard in salads is more of a "southern" taste.  I'm from the North.   Next time I may just try adding a bit of "powdered mustard" to add a kick but it may not be needed because of the jalape√±os.  I will keep this in my rotation - but Kim's Macaroni Salad is still my favorite.  Maybe I will add the veggies from this to Kim's Macaroni Salad to kick that up a notch.  Love all the ideas you get from Allrecipes.

Like many of Chef John‚Äôs recipes, this one rates top notch!  The idea to add the extra pepper types, little sugar, and nice variety of other vegetables is genius!  Not only do I get compliments, I get request for the recipe.  And yes, I forward the real recipe  with the real Chef.......

I was looking for a dairy free pasta salad dressing and this was delicious. I didn't have the exact veggies on hand so used what I had and also added chicken. The dressing worked perfectly, people loved it at a potluck.

WOW, 
Another mystery solved. I always wondered how to do this right. One secret is to cook the macaroni a longer time as this recipe suggests. Another top tip is to refrain from rinsing the pasta after it is cooked. 

I love the flavors of the vegetables. Carrots, who would have thought of them?  It is colorful and tasty and disappeared fast.

The flavors are fantastic, BUT the amount of liquid ingredients should be increased by about 25%.  I'm very sensitive to spicy foods, and the amount of jalapeno and poblano peppers is perfect; they add a great depth of flavor but no discernible heat.

I eliminated jalape√±os because I don't like very spicy foods. Also didn‚Äôt have Dijon mustard so used spicy brown. Didn‚Äôt use poblano peppers either. Still it was delicious. Will make it again. Can‚Äôt go wrong with Chef John recipes.

I made a couple of tweeks (no celery, green for poblano), and it was delicious.  I really like the slight spice that the jalapeno and cayenne add.

I followed the recipe to the ‚ÄúT‚Äù and it‚Äôs perfect.  I took the seeds and veins out of both the jalape√±o and poblano pepper to keep the heat at bay and this is the best macaroni salad I have ever had.  Takes a while to dice the veggies up, but totally worth the time.  You can prep this the day before (diced veggies and dressing) cook pasta that night and assemble it, and just let it sit until your ready to serve.  I also love it when there‚Äôs a video that goes along with the recipe.  DELICIOUS!

Generally speaking, I do not care for macaroni salad, until now. Thanks Chef John for making me a macaroni salad convert!  This will now be the only recipe I use and the only macaroni salad I will eat. Ever.  The only changes I made were to throw in some extra cayenne, jalepeno and pobalano peppers.  This is a keeper!!

My mum said she liked this dish, but I thought it was a tad too much vinegar for me - as I‚Äôm one to follow the recipe this one wasn‚Äôt for me! However, a creamier dressing would be really nice I may try a similar thing with chives.

Excellent! Rave reviews from everyone at the party. I skipped the poblano/jalapenos and used a pickled hot pepper from Mama Lil's plus a bit of relish and added olives. I can see why some people think it's dry if you want a "gloppy" texture. I didn't find it dry. Perfectly creamy for my taste.

I really liked this pasta salad - my husband even more than me. It's a good combo of lightly creamy and vinegary - not too much of either. I substituted the carrots and bell pepper for green onion (because I forgot to buy them at the store) and it was really good. I actually ate it within about an hour of making it and I thought it was great. The jalapeno doesn't make it spicy, just a flavor, when you remove the seeds.

I made this mac salad for our Fourth of July dinner and got rave reviews!!  Watching the video made me realize I had been missing some steps.  The only thing I changed was adding only 1/2 of the jalapeno so it wouldn't be too spicy and adjusting salt and sugar to taste before adding it all.  It was good for 2 days because that's as long as it wasn't all eaten!  It's a keeper!  Thanks Chef John!  You are my go to guy!

Great recipe.
I doubled the black pepper and cayenne.  I like it slightly spicier.
I also tried it with 50/50 mayonnaise and miracle whip.  Tasty as well.

This was delicious! I made it exactly as Chef John instructed, and it was probably the best mac salad I've ever had. It was moist, tangy, fresh, comforting, and just plain delicious.  I made it again and just before serving added some (thawed) frozen peas and small-diced cheddar cheese, which was also great. This will definitely be appearing at all of our BBQs and gatherings. Thank you once again, Chef John, for a great recipe and for expert tips on how to make something good even better.

Another great recipe from Chef John. This is a really tasty recipe, and is even better the second day. The only change I made was I didn't use a full 1/4 cup of the jalapeno because I've become  more sensitive to spicy food. I don't think it would have been too much though, if I had.  Oh,  I did add more dressing also,  on the advice of others.  I'll be making it again!

Made this for a BBQ.  I heard like 5 people say "Who made this, it's great!"  I used apple cider vinegar and chilled overnight.  Mixed about 1/2 cup more mayonnaise thinned with some vinegar in the next day as so much of the dressing had been absorbed.

1/4c white vinegar and mayonnaise and Dijon mustard was far too much vinegar. I doubled the macaroni amount and added 6 hard boiled eggs and it evened out the over powering vinegar!!  Need to add more salt too.  Flavorless (except real vinegary) when following the recipe to the letter.

I revised the recipe slightly to use what I had on hand. I used garlic chives from my herb garden in place of greem onions and stone ground mustard in place of Dijon. I made this for a fried chicken picnic but Im going to have to make it again because I cant stop eating it and the picnic is tomorrow.

I followed this recipe to the letter in ingredients and methodology from the video. I feel like this is a good base recipe, but it is definitely missing something. Also, the amount of peppers in this is just too much for my taste. The sauce is nice, and I didn't feel that it was too dry, like other reviewers did, but next time I make it I would probably take out the pablanos, reduce the amount of red peppers, and perhaps add either some other veggies or maybe pickles or relish? Perhaps adding egg would add another layer of flavour that would make it a bit more rounded. 
As I said, the sauce is great, but the recipe as a whole could use some tweaking for our tastes.

Hands down the best macaroni salad you will find. I made it exactly as the recipe the first time and it was amazing. The only thing I do now is add more salt, sugar, and mayo, but that's personal preference. Easy five stars.

I made it almost exactly as written except the jalape√±o pepper which I substituted a green pepper like another reviewer did.  It turned out good but I felt it was missing something.  My husband wants me to put cubed cheese in it.  I might try that.

OMG this was the very best maccaroni salad I've ever made or eaten.  Chef John's way of  mixing the sauce and then the veggies and lastly the maccaroni was point on and oh so delicious.  I did add a tablespoon of  harissa, a Moracan hot pepper sauce and oo-wee was is delicious!  But it was Chef John's recipe that did it for me and of course, I'll be using his receipe again and again!.

On my second recipe I used shells and it seemed to need a bit more of the "sauce."  Also for the vegetables I skipped all the chopping and used Guidry's Fresh Cuts Creole Seasoning. It's all the basics of cajun/creole cooking pre-chopped (celery,onion,bell pepper,green onion,garlic). Easy peasy!

Best macaroni salad!  I followed the instructions except I added an additional jalapeno pepper.  Everyone loved it.  The extra pepper may be too much for some.  Next time I will stick to the script.  It was not sweet and it was not soupy.  This is definitely a keeper!

The adjustments I made earned this recipe 5 stars, for my personal taste. I did not add any peppers because I did not want the heat, I'm a wimp.
I used only about a teaspoon of mustard, otherwise it would have been too tangy for me.  I  added about 1/4 cup more of mayo, just because it seemed kind of dry.  I added just a pinch of cayenne, for the same reason I left out the peppers.  I left out the carrots for no particular reason.  These changes were just a personal preference, I'm sure the recipe as written is a 5 star recipe for most people.  I did follow the technique, not rinsing the macaroni and allowing it to cool completely before adding the mayo mixture.  I'm sure that is a good idea.
Thanks CJ!!

I've made this twice; first time, via directions.  For our family, it was a bit "spicy", with the bits. 
Second time, to my/our taste.  I do agree with CJ about the dressing. He is spot on:-)).   second round, I followed the recipe, until it came to the "peppers".  I used all bell peppers. Perfect for me and the family:-))

Love it! 
Following the crucial directions, I made mine with tomato, sweet pickles, and John's choices as follows: carrot, scallions, celery, salt and pepper, mayo...
I omitted peppers and sugar and used some red wine vinegar. The salad is sweet and tasty!

In my photos I show pictures of the salad ready to go into the fridge for a slumber overnight, and the finished product. Refreshing is not necessary, but I'll likely do so!  Thanks, John!

This is one of the best macaroni salad recipes!!  I followed the directions on Chef John's video on how to put the salad together. He always gives great tips. Thank you to Chef John! 
I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I made this for a family party and everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Chef John, this was the best Macaroni Salad I have ever made!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and all I can say is EXCELLENT!  I think the key to it being so good is that you don't rinse the macaroni, and it's best if refrigerated overnight.   The dressing gives it such a wonderful mouth-watering taste.  YUM!!!

Great!  Too spicy for me though.  Next time I will go lighter with seeded hot peppers and with cayenne.  I added sweet peas from my garden.

Great recipe without any fancy additions.  I did add some small diced pickles and chives.  And instead of water to freshen the salad before serving, I added 2 tbsp of dill pickle juice.  Amazing.

I've made this, as written, numerous times.  The tip to drain, not rinse and cool the pasta to room temp before dressing  makes a big difference.   The addition of jalapenos and poblanos are a wonderful accent.

My first time making macaroni salad and it was amazing.  My whole family loved it.  My teenage girls are picky and they had seconds.  I don‚Äôt like sweet macaroni salad and this was not sweet at all.  I  followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  The hot peppers add a really nice flavour.

Easy to follow instructions I added ham and didn‚Äôt have carrots so I left those out i only used one teaspoon of salt. It still was a little too salty for me but I would definitely be making this again without the added salt.

I made this following the recipe - no changes. I really liked it but it isn't "my mother's mac salad". I am used to a more mayonaissy salad. It is not too spicy and the variety of veggies is a plus. Do let it rest as long as possible and it is better. I am a salt lover and so I added salt to my serving. Speaking of which, this recipe, as with many on this site, did not state a serving size. Based on quantity, I figure one cup per serving. If not, please correct me.

Very good but I decreased the jalape√±os , didn't add poblanos, and added sour cream to cut the heat from the jalepenos. Makes a lot so cut in half if you don't need to feed a crowd.

This was a spur of the moment dish so I left out all of the pepper because I didn't have any.  Everything else I included in the recipe and didn't rinse the noodles.  The 1 TBS of sugar was just enough to cut the vinegar but not sweet at all (a good thing).  This is a refreshing, tangy salad that my entire family ate up (no left overs). I will be making this again.

WILL MAKE AGAIN.
My only exception was I omitted the jalapenos, used regular mustard (didn't have Dijon on hand) and added black olives because mac salad isn't the same without. Oh ya, I tossed in a couple of TB spoons of sweet relish and dehydrated onions in addition to the green onions (just cause).
I'm not crazy about things that are HOT and was concerned about trying  Poblanos (which are supposed to be mild) but I did. Do they have some heat YES but with most mayo based salads it was barely noticeable in the end. Will I omit in future - probably or at least chop very tiny to soak up the mayo better and decrease the heat (which again is minimal). 
Salad VERY colorful, crunchy, tangy but creamy just yummy. At a family BBQ there was barely any leftovers.... darn I have to make more for home :)

I love that this is just a classic macaroni salad.  The only substitution I made was to use pickled hot peppers instead of fresh jalapenos (I made it for a work potluck, and I know some co-workers don't like spicy food).   Really nice flavour from the Dijon.

Delicious! As one reviewer said...don‚Äôt be afraid to use the peppers. Not spicy or hot at all! Just a little added flavour that makes this macaroni salad stand out from the rest. 
I did have to double the dressing as I too, found it too dry. Next time I will either double it right from the beginning or I will only use 2 cups of dry macaroni instead of 4. Everyone loves it and  judging by that comment, you probably can tell that I‚Äôll definitely be making it again!

Really liked this recipe - especially the fact that it does not separate or weep after a day in the refrigerator. Added canned tuna to the leftovers and had a delicious tuna Mac salad for dinner the next evening. Will be making this often during the summer.

This was fantastic! I would definitely suggest doubling the amount of  dressing as the pasta does tend to absorb it overnight. I think next time I will also add hard boiled eggs to it.

This macaroni salad was soooooo good! Being Vegan, I switched the regular mayonnaise with the Vegan mayonnaise. I also couldn't find the poblano peppers, so I used 2 Jalapeno peppers instead. Still came out good. Everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used small shell-shaped noodles in place of the elbow macaroni.  This was a mistake as the shells spoon together and are not covered by the dressing.   The jalapeno peppers added a nice subtle heat.

This recipe is really a nice light, classic, basic recipe. The only change I made was to make 1-1/2 times the amount of dressing and the next time I will double the dressing as it still is a rather dry salad at 1-1/2 times.   The nice part though is that the dressing doesn't run all over your plate and dress everything around it, it all stays together.  Definitely a keeper and absolutely a nice alternative to potato salad. Next time I may add some sliced black olives and seeded, chopped tomato right before serving (or just on the side). I think they would add a nice tang to the salad.  6/2018 UPDATE: I have since made this salad several times and have never been disappointed. While I haven't added the olives or tomatoes I did add cooked, chopped shrimp. It was awesome. Poblano peppers aren't easy to find in our area, but do make a difference in the salad. When I couldn't get them, I upped the jalapeno. While good, not the same as using poblano. Before I'm done, I plan to try using some ham in the salad also - either by itself or along with the shrimp. I'd be willing to bet the combo would be great tasting also.

Rather bland and pretty dry. I did like the mixture of the veggies, but it needed more dressing and something to add more flavor to the dressing. My problem is that I can't figure out what that something should be. After making and adding more dressing, it was a bit better. I didn't dislike it, but I'm not sure I liked it enough to make it again.

Well, thank you Chef John.  I never caught on in the past that the hot macaroni made the mayonnaise weird.  I scaled this way back to 4 servings, increased the proportion of veggies to macaroni, and used sweet pickle juice instead of vinegar.  Why throw away that tasty pickle juice?  Otherwise followed the directions exactly.

This is amazing. Trust me (and most of the other reviewers) when I say this is the best mac salad ive ever tasted. The peppers do not make it hot and spicy. I made this exactly as written...everyone at the gathering LOVED it.

With all the spicy ingrediants, I was a little hesitant to try this salad. I read all the reviews and decided to just stick with the original recipe and change it after I tried the original. Glad I did! It was great! All my guest loved it. It was smooth and very flavorful. Not spicey at all. The only change I will make is the final step to freshen up the salad. I had to add 3 tbs each of mayo and water instead of the suggested 1 tbs each but that's probably because I let it set overnight instead of 4 hours. Will definately make it again.

I made this for a funeral reception at my church using the recipe as written.  After I tasted it I was a little concerned an older crowd might find it a little too spicy.  I like spice but was concerned for others.  The ladies that help with the reception raved about it and asked me to make it again.  I gave it only four stars as my heat loving husband was not quite as crazy about it as others.

This was very good.  I think the technique he describes in the video is what makes this so creamy and good.  The poblano and jalapeno peppers were a welcomed addition.  I may add a second jalapeno next time for more of a kick, because this was mild by my standards.

I made it just as the recipe stated. It was very easy and delicious. I was apprehensive about the amount of cayenne called for as my DH is super sensitive, but it was not detectable at all. I am glad I did not omit it since I think the Pasta Salad would have been a little bland without it.

This is the BEST macaroni I ever had! I omitted the spicy peppers but kept the cayenne, personal preference. It was so delicious I made a huge batch and served it at my wedding! Everyone loved it, and they have been asking me to make it for all the family functions ever since!

Since I have a special liking for Chef John & always check out his recipes, I followed the directions of this yummy salad exactly as written.  It was delicious & well received at the dinner party I made it for. Would not change anything.  Once you make it the first time, you may change the dressing a bit or use different veggies or spice it up a bit but that will be up to the individual

Perfect macaroni salad. The zestiness from the jalapeno and poblano peppers is just right. Not hot at all.

I made it just like it said and turned out great! Just make sure to use gloves when you cut up peppers as I learned the hard way.

Made this for the 4th of July.  My husband doesn't like any of these types of salads because of the mayo flavor. It was such a hit the recipe was copied by many who were able to get some. It just went so fast. My husband loved it. The blend of flavors is great. I did use only 1/2 Tbls of sugar and I didn't have poblanos so I used one red and one green jalapenos. Refrigerated about 4 hours.

Loved it and it is the best pasta salad yet!  I did cut back on the jalape√±o since I didn't have a fresh one but had a jar of the hot I bought instead of the mild by mistake.  I used about 1 Tablespoon.

LOVE  this recipe, Chef John!!!!!!  I added 1/2 T. more  sugar, and did not put in all of the amount of jalape√±o called for (too scared to) :)!  Today, we'll see. Maybe I will throw in the rest!?!
I definitely will make this again!!!! Next time I will do the chopping one day and the rest the next day, as it was time consuming for me.  I am not much of a cook! 
Thanks Chef John and allrecipes.com!!!!!!!

Everyone loved this recipe; great flavors.  I added crab meat, because I had it on hand, and it was delicious.  Perfect for a summer pot luck.

This is a very good salad, tho painful to make-- my fingers are still burning the day after from cutting the jalapeno. Didn't add cayenne, sugar or poblano (couldn't find that last one); let it chill overnight, and very good depth of flavor.

Chef John has amazing recipes! I've made this twice so far with rave reviews! I omitted the sugar, carrots, and poblano pepper because I didn't have it on hand, and I love it this way! My family loves the spiciness of the  jalape√±os, and the creaminess of the salad!

I must admit, I have NEVER been a fan of macaroni salad. This was my 1st attempt at preparing it. I knew it was something special with the perfect combination of veggies. And it was! I prepared it for guests, two of whom voiced a dislike for the dish. Listen, each left with a carry-out. Need I say more? Don't alter an ingredient.

Excellent. Better the next day for sure.  I couldn't get poblano peppers so I used small red and yellow chili peppers instead. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I LOVE macaroni salad.  I REALLY loved this. And hubby doesn't like macaroni salad but he liked this.  Went back for seconds.  So that tells you how good this is.

Best Mac Salad ever!! My husband is a picky eater and he loved this recipe.

Recommend leaving set overnight to allow dressing to absorb into macaroni and follow step 4 to "refresh" the dressing before serving!

I did not add the jalapeno pepper or poblano pepper and it was excellent! I was looking for this recipe to make it again for Christmas as it is our favorite macaroni salad.

First, I admit that I substituted the jalapeno and poblano with more bell peppers, because I was making a double recipe for a crowd, I never had made it before, and I wasn't sure about using the heat.  Also, we needed protein, so I added diced ham.  (We saved some without ham for the vegetarians.) Next time, I'll try it exactly as written!

That being said, it was a really good salad, and I'm sure I'll make it again!

Chef John does it again! I love that his recipes are home-style and easy to make, yet delicious. Out of all of the dishes I prepared for a recent party, this was hands down the favorite. Everyone commented on how delicious it was, and asked for the recipe! Thanks, Chef John!

This recipe was very tasty.  I appreciate watching the video first, letting the dressing set first, then cooking the macaroni and adding that into the dressing.  The only change I made was adding a little more mayonnaise to the recipe.  Very good.

I was a little afraid of using the peppers, so I used just a small amount and chopped until really fine.  It came out tasting great! I made it the night before and that gave time for all the flavors to blend. Next time, I will use a little more of the peppers.

Chef John:  I think you saved my marriage! I went from a  fairly bad cook, to (when I follow your directions)actually pretty good... not just because of THIS recipe--it's ALL of your recipes!

  I've made this recipe about 6 times this summer.  EVERYONE loves it!

One word - YUM!  I've made it three times, all to rave reviews and  empty bowls.  I did make some small changes based on personal preference and what I had on hand.  I was skeptical about the directions for the cooked macaroni, but I followed them to a tee - SPOT ON!  Instead of white vinegar, I used champagne vinegar - try it!!  I didn't use either the black or cayenne peppers (I felt that the heat from the jalapeno would suffice and it does), no diced celery, shredded carrots or red bell pepper.  Instead, I subbed a whole orange bell pepper not only for the flavor and crunch factor but also color.  The salad does need to sit in the fridge over night.  To "freshen it" the next day, 1 mix 1-1/2 tsp. (eyeballed and to taste) mayo, dijon mustard, champagne vinegar and a bit of water to thin it out. " OUTSTANDING" are the comments I get with my changes and it's my new required contribution to summer BBQ's.

This recipe is FABULOUS.  I wasn't sure of the peppers but I must tell you it was a phenomenal success. I had five guest and all of the macaroni salad was GONE-people wanted to take any that was left over home.  This is the kind of recipe's I like.  Honesty from the Chef along with ingredients that marry each other to make a delectable dish!
   I made chicken wings for my main course that were marinated in mango habanero and chili sauce.  I also served fresh grilled  corn on the cob with a poblano lime crema.  Dessert was a frozen pistachio mold light and airy. A dinner party that people are still raving about!  Thank you Chef John, I will follow you anywhere.

Delicious!!!  made this exactly as written, and wow is it good! made it the night before, as wouldn't have had time the day of the bbq...my kids and granddaughter tasted it, and said 'don't add a thing!"...so did not add the  T of mayo and water before serving, but it might have, as the recipe said, freshened up the look of it...everyone loved it, said this is way better than what you can buy....try it, and follow the directions to cool the macaroni down....

Made it exactly by the recipe.  It is the best macaroni salad ever without a doubt.  Chef John never lets you down!  My husband doesn't like spicy and he didn't even notice the jalape√±o and poblano peppers!  It simply added lots of flavor.

Fresh, clean, crisp flavors. Might be the best macaroni salad I have ever had. I usually add a little more than 1 tablespoon of mayo before serving, but other than that, no changes.

Great salad. Family loved it. I personally thought it was a bit too sour for my taste.

I thought this was really good!  Added some split cherry tomatoes, which added a brightness.  We love spicy here at my house, so I'll probably take it up a notch for us, but my friends that didn't like  hot food still really liked it.

Made this exactly  per chef John's recipe and was absolutely delicious. Wife said was the best she ever tasted. Don't be shy about the jalapeno and Poblano   peppers, chop them up fine and they really add a great new dimension to the flavor.

I made this exactly as per recipe.  I didn't  change a thing. It was a big hit with my family. There was no heat at all, just flavor of the peppers.  The next time I make it, I will probably add extra cayenne and black pepper for more heat.  This is a keeper recipe.

Loved it. Added more red pepper for more color but stuck to the recipe. Has a real "kick" (and I am not a hot or spicy lover) but the flavors were wonderful together. Will make again!

cut the recipe by 2/3.  Was only making it for 2 people.  Was excellent.  Used whole wheat elbow macaroni. Didn't have poblano peppers, used all jalepeno.  We like spicy food those this was good.  Love it not having a ton of mayo.
