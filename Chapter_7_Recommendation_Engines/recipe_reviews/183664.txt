This was delicious. It had an amazingly unique taste but I think I would have used a little less spices. it was very strong

I adored this, I like my drinks to be on the tart side so I omitted the sugar completely and I also used frozen mango.  I will make this frequently, I may even freeze some garden mint to make this over the winter.

WOW-great flavor and so refreshing.  Just a few minor changes I made were using vanilla yogurt, therefore needed less brown sugar and I found some chocolate mint at a Farmer's market which tastes great in this drink.  Have been looking for various ways to use up the ground star anise and this is perfect.  More stars from us on this one!  Curious to taste with a spicy Indian meal too.  I am going to do a comparison with another Mango Lassi recipe on this site also.  Thanks for the post.

I dont really know anything about Lassi, but I was looking for a recipe to use up some mint, and I think I might make a habit of buying mint, just for this delicious recipe. It is delightfully refreshing with just the right amount of spice.

I've never had a lassi before. I think the spices are too strong and should be reduced at least by half; maybe even a quarter. I used frozen chunks of mango but felt there wasn't enough to flavour the lassi and would increase the amount next time. I used half yogurt and half low-fat (5%) sour cream (didn't have enough yogurt) which worked out well. Would maybe make again with changes.

I made this with a bag of frozen mango and dried mint instead of fresh. I also added honey, used plain and vanilla Greek yogurt and sort of measured everything to taste. I made it in two batches and when the first was too sweet I adjusted the second batch and they merged into one delicious concoction which drew rave reviews at the Indian potluck at which it was served. Thanks, Jonathan!

I used light vanilla yogurt and omitted the brown sugar. Yum! Very refreshing.

Great bace recipe.. I have many allergies so I always have to substitute.. 
I omitted the yogurt and the sugar (major allergies to me) 

I added rice milk and coconut nectar 

Also did not have anise which I think would add a yummy flavor and I also added water 

OH wow came out

I made this to compliment a chicken curry/rice pulse meal. It was a hit. I definitely will be making this again.
