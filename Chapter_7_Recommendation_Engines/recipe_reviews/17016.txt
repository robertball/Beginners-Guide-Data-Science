Oh, Wow!  This got absolutely RAVE reviews from my boyfriend, to whom every mean is usually the same: "good."  I did make a couple adjustments, though: shook the chicken up in a ziploc bag with the oil (added a little more), vinegar (and used some balsamic as well), garlic, and some seasoning salt (Alpine Touch), then put in the greased dish with more vinegar, oil, and garlic sprinkled over. Dusted with cajun and black pepper and cooked, then added a bit of chicken broth and red pepper flakes with the mushrooms/green onions.  A tip: to reduce shriveling and browning of mushrooms, put the green onions over top the mushrooms.  This recipe is really versatile;  it was fine in the oven an extra ten minutes (with the oven shut off) while i finished up the rest of the meal.  Served with Asiago Sun-dried Tomato Pasta (see review) with farfelle pasta tossed with parsley, olive oil, parmasan, and red and black pepper.  I'll DEFINATELY make this again!

This is WONDERFUL! Very moist chicken. The only thing different I did was put the oil, vinegar,and garlic in a zip lock bag and shook it with chicken in it. Then I put it in my baking pan.

We quite enjoyed this recipe. I read through the reviews and used some of the suggestions when I made it tonight for dinner. I used a plastic bag and put the oil, vinegar, garlic and some seasoning salt in, then tossed the chicken in and gave it all a good smooshing around, put it in a greased dish, topped it with some Creole seasoning (all I had) and then pepper, then tossed on some red pepper flakes for good measure. Chucked it in the oven as the recipe says, after 30 minutes I took it out and topped it with some baby bellas and the chopped green onions and cooked it 15 minutes more. When it came out, I topped it with the sliced swiss and let it sit whilst I whipped up some rice-a-roni angel hair pasta as a side, toasted up some BBQ bread (hubby HAS to have bread), and then it was ready to eat! We all agreed it was quite tasty, fairly simple, and made for a marvelous presentation. It DID look like something from a restaurant. Hubby even stated I should add it to my keeper file. That's high praise around here.

This chicken was really easy to make, and tasted pretty good.  I followed the advice of others and marinated the chicken with the other ingredients in a big ziplock bag.  Then after I put the chicken in casserole dish, I cut a small hole in the bottom of the bag and poured out the marinade on top of the chicken.  It was easy and mess-free!

This was a great make-ahead recipe!  Combine chicken, garlic, oil, vinegar and seasoning in a zip top bag and freeze.  Then just thaw and bake - The toppings require very little prep.  My whole family loved this!  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  We had it with steamed green beans and refrigerated mashed potatoes.  Yum!

Sorry, but this dish was not all that tasty to my husband and I. I followed the recipe and it sure smelled and looked good, but the taste was simply mediocre.

Like previous reviews suggested, I combined the oil, vinegar, garlic, about a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar, and a little of the cajun seasoning in a slider bag and shook the chicken up in there nice and good.. after that I placed in the baking dish and sprinkled with a lot of the cajun seasoning.. 

this recipe was extremely easy to make, turned out great.. very very moist! this ones a keeper!

This recipe was excellent.  I'm a nanny for triplets who are 8 years old and one of my boys are EXTREMELY picky.  He doesn't like just any kind of food, but with this one, they all really liked a lot.  I tried some too and it was yummy.  The only thing that I did differently was that I put the oil, vinegar and seasonings in a bag like some of the other reviews mentioned, then i added the chicken to the bag and I left it like that in the fridge for about 4 hours to marinate.  It really was awesome.  Will definately make again.  Can't wait to make it for my husband, he'll love it.  Thanks a million.

This recipe was really very good.  I was
a little afraid to use the cajun seasoning so I think I didn't add enough.  Next time I will try more.  My husband liked this one and I will make it again in the future.

I made this for the second time tonight. It was very good! I'll definitely be making this again. I marinated the chicken in a zip lock bag with the vinegar, oil, garlic, and Cajun seasoning overnight. It makes it so much tastier. I also pound the chicken. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was a tad overcooked. I'll cook it 10 minutes less next time.

If we could give this 10 stars we would.  I marrinated the chicken in the oil/vinegar/cajun seasoning for about 5 hours, drained and blotted the chicken and then topped with additional cajun seasoning before baking.  Topped with lite swiss cheese when mostly done.  Next time will use twice as much mushrooms.  Key to this recipe is using a cajun seasoning blend you like and adjust cooking time based on size of chicken breasts.  Absolutely delicious!  Made this on the grill tonight for a change from the normal baking after marrinating the chicken for about 3 hours.  Did the mushrooms in additional vinegar and cajun seasonings in foil.  The flavors really pop more on the grill, especially when hit with a squeeze of lime when serving.  Thanks so much for this easy and versatile recipe.

i was already making burgandy mushrooms when i found this recipe to go with it. Because of that, i chose to top the chicken with a sprinkling of chopped frozen spinach and swiss, but otherwise, followed the recipe. It was wonderful!! kids (2-9) and hubby have already asked for it again! Thanks so much

Tasty!  Used less red wine vinegar and more mushrooms.  Topped Shaun's with mozzarella and mine with swiss.  Delicious both ways.

Awesome and quick.  The only thing I changed was the seasoning because I only had Creole Seasoning.  Husband loved it and he doesn't normally rave about chicken

I am not a fan of mushrooms and this was really good.  I would increase the cajun seasoning next time. I don't think you need a cup of green onions.

This was a hit with the whole family! I didn't have all the ingredients so I improvised a bit. Instead of cajun seasoning, I used Sriracha hot chili sauce, mozzarella instead of swiss, and balsamic vinegar. It turned out fantastic, I do think the swiss would have made it even better though, the mozzarella was a little bland with it.

This was fantastic! I cut the recipe in half, but doubled the garlic and added 1/2 tsp onion powder (I omitted the green onions). I marinated the chicken in the oil, vinegar, garlic, Cajun seasoning, and onion powder for about 20 minutes before baking. I also used a small can of mushrooms instead of fresh and used shredded Swiss. It was SO good with excellent flavor! Next time I will cut down on the baking time, but other than that, this recipe is perfect!

Wasn't my favorite, but it was okay.  I followed other reviews and marinated in a zip lock bag.  Vinegar flavor was a little too strong.

Delish & super simple! Didn't have green onions, so sliced a few rings of yellow. Mixed marinade right in the dish & massaged it into the chicken. Made a few slits in the breast as well. A definite keeper.

Lots of flavor, my family and I enjoyed this dish and will definately make again.  I only changed one thing and that was to drain the excess liquid prior to topping with the scallions, mushrooms and swiss cheese.

5 stars from a single guy. Pretty easy to make, amazing taste. I was going to make 2 servings, but I'm glad I went with 4 servings. I now how some more of this great dish for tomorrow :).  I used natural apple vinegar and I put the chicken and mix in a regular plastic bag since I don't have a zip-lock bag and no red-wine vinegar. I also used powdered garlic, i thought getting my hands dirty for just one clove was too much of a hassle :)  Thanks for sharing, keep it up :)

This was pretty good. I cooked the mushrooms 1st in a skillet with some olive oil and the vineger and made a sauce on the side (my husband has to have a gravy) with a little broth and wine and  some wine vineger thickened with cornstarch.

I love mushrooms and I love swiss, so combining the two are most definitely a winner!  I followed this recipe pretty much dead on, except cut it in half for just two of us and left out the sprinkles of green onion towards the end (was out).  The result was moist and juicy and had great flavour - perfect with a nice green salad to round out the meal!

Very tasty and using ingredients that I usually have on hand.  Could vary the cheese used for a difference flavor.  An easy recipe that we have enjoyed a couple of times now.

I didn't know if this was going to be very good, but it was just delicious.  I did alter it just a bit by marinating the chicken  overnight in the garlic, oil, vinegar, cajun seasoning, and red pepper flakes.  I thought the chicken would be too spicy, but it really wasn't at all.  The chicken was very tender and juicy, and the cheese, onions, and mushrooms gave the dish an elegant look and wonderful flavors.  I did, as others had suggested, put the onions on top of the mushrooms, to keep the mushrooms from drying out.  I would surely make this again.  It will be something I can serve to company.

WOW! This was super yummy. My cajun was a little too spicy so I probably won't use as much next time. Might even try a different seasoning. But overall, super easy & super yummy!

Was a little shy on the mushrooms (wife commented it needed more) to use up the ones already sliced up from the day prior. Will add more cayanne than the recipe called for. Served with carrots and brown rice with Agave Nectar lightly used over both. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I decided to take it a step further and marinate it for a couple hours in a plastic bag. The end result was .... it was bland - no flavor at all. Will not make again. So disappointed, why did so many ppl say it was so good? I could only have imagined what this recipe would've tasted like had I not decided to marinate it.

This was one of the best recipes we had in a long time!  It was flavorful, melt in the mouth delicious.  It's a definite repeat.  I did butterfly my chicken because we don't like big thick pieces.    Just the right amount of chicken with all the extras.  We did melt the cheese in the oven a bit.  Loved this recipe.

We weren't very impressed with this recipe.  It wasn't bad, there just wasn't much flavour to it.  Was worth a try, but wasn't a "keeper" for us.

My husband absolutely loved this!  I halved the recipe (just for me and him, I wouldn't dare give my 2 year old something different. lol)  The only thing I did differently was use Old Bay seasoning and used slightly less mushrooms and onions.  I will use less of the seasoning next time.  I served it with rice, as suggested, and it is a very filling meal.  And pretty!  Overall, a great dish!

No one in my family liked this recipe. We followed the recipe exactly as written. The vinegar and creole spice just didn't match up well with the mushrooms and swiss. There were too many different things going on with this one. We were all very disappointed. Normally, we tend to like highly rated recipes. This is one of the few that just didn't cut it. Sorry!

I have made this dish several times now. The only thing I do differently is I marinade the chicken in a ziplock bag with the oil, garlic and some of the Cajun seasoning for about an hour. Then I put it in a baking pan and top with the rest of the seasoning and follow the remaining directions as is. This dish is very flavorful and simple to make. Scrumptious!

So amazingly yummy I loved it! The only thing I did differently was I didn't measure the oil/vinegar/cajun seasoning and I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. I also put it back in the oven with the oven off after I put the cheese on it for about 2 minutes to help it melt faster. I served it with green beans and wild rice. I took some of the loose mushrooms and green onions and sprinkled it over the rice with some of the juice. Yum yum yum!

I marinated the chicken in the oil, vinegar, garlic and Cajun seasoning for about two hours before baking.  It turned out very moist and flavorful.  My husband added salt and pepper, though I thought the Cajun seasoning had enough salt for my taste.  We both enjoyed this dish and I would make it again.

I made this for my fiance last night and we absolutely loved it. When he came in the kitchen and saw what I was making he suggested simmering the green onions with olive oil and shallots first before adding it to the mushrooms and chicken. It was a hit. He had his with cous cous and I had mine with a spinach and asparagus salad recipe that I got from this site. Such a healthy and delicious meal!

Very good!  The only thing I did differently was bake it a little bit more after I put the cheese on as opposed to just "letting it melt" to really get it gooey!

Yum! I made this with whole chicken pieces, and roasted it uncovered for a little over an hour. I left out the cheese, and used chives instead of green onion. It came out moist and bursting with flavor; my family loved it.

This was DELICIOUS. I used the vinegar, garlic, and olive oil to marinate the chicken for about an hour before I baked it. The mushrooms and onions soaked up the flavors from the liquid and were fantastic with the tender, cheesy chicken. Highly recommended.

My boyfriend and I really liked this. It sounds really simple, but the flavors are really good. i marinated the chicken for a couple of hours, then cooked it with the mushrooms in the oven. Really very good, simple and easy and yummy, especially if you like like mushroom swiss burgers and stuff.

This was a fabulous recipe. Even my toddler ate it. I didn't use breasts but all the pieces I had leftover from a previously roasted chicken. So I didn't do the whole 30 minutes to start because the chicken was already cooked. Instead I did about 15 to let the oil/vinegar flavors congeal and then followed the recipe as written. And I also didn't use Swiss slices, I grated about a cup and a half of a block and topped it with that.

I LOVE this recipe. I serve it over whole-grain thin spaghetti tossed with olive oil and red pepper flakes, but any pasta will do. Also, the Swiss cheese is optional for me... sometimes I forget to use it and don't notice until dinner is over. This makes delicious leftovers.

Awesome recipe! I also added a few rings of onion for extra flavour and some chopped up green bell pepper for something extra! Served with a baked potato

The chicken was extremely moist, but it just didn't have much flavor and I followed the directions exactly. Everyone in my family thought it was missing something. I will likely use this recipe as a base recipe and will alter it. I'll need to read some of the other reviews for suggestions.

Don't mess this dish up like I did by using creole seasoning as it turned out way too salty. I was out of cajun spice so I didn't think it would matter. Next time I will look up a recipe for homemade cajun seasoning salt free. Otherwise this would have turned out pretty good. I used double the garlic as we love garlic.

I give this four stars but with a little tweaking.  I suggest to generously douse with red wine vinegar. What it calls for just wasn't enough for me.

This recipe was very good. The chicken picked up a great flavor, not too strong. I made a slight change, added red and green pepper to the veggies on top, but would probably saute' the veggies before I put them on next time. All in all, very good and I will be making it again.

Slow cooker adaptation! I sauteed 8 oz of fresh mushrooms, 4 chopped green onions and 2 cloves of chopped garlic  in the olive oil until tender then added the red wine vinegar, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 tablespoon of italian seasoning, and 1 tsp of paprika. I heated this through then poured over the chicken breasts in the slow cooker. Set it on low for 6 hours. Served it over rice and sprinkled with shredded swiss cheese just before serving. Delicious!!

Not what I was expecting at all, it was much better!  The cheese really makes this dish!  I didn't use olive oil, just a bit of Pam in the pan.  The vinegar scared me, but it came out with the most wonderful flavor!  It's a keeper!

Very tasty recipe; different from the typical chicken dinners we are used to! I didn't have time to allow the chicken to marinate, so I pierced the chicken and rolled it in the vinegar/oil mixture to try to infuse the flavors. I added a medium onion as well, quartered. I wish that the sauce was a little thicker. Maybe for leftovers I can thicken it with cornstarch! It was very very good nonetheless!

This was FABULOUS... I have 2 of the pickiest boys 9 and 6. They LOVED it. The only change I made was I baked it at 400. Very little ingredients and quick to prep. Definately a keeper

This was a wonderfully tasty dish. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed it very much. I paired it with a wild mushroom and herb couscous. It complemented the chicken nicely. When I make it again, and I most certainly will, I plan to use portabella mushrooms and make a mushroom sauce to drizzle lightly over the plate. I will pair it, this time, with a plain couscous, or try a risotto.

This recipe is a KEEPER! I used Tony Chachere's seasoning as the cajun style seasoning and instead of Swiss, we used Provolone.  My hubby said after dinner that this is likely the best chicken dish I've gotten off of here.  I do agree with him!!  SCRUMPTIOUS!  THANKS!!!!

This has got to be the best baked chicken recipe I have ever tried! The cheese and sauce keep the chicken moist throughout! I do sub the vinagar for a white wine which I prefer. I will make this recipe often!

I don't know how these ingredients come together and taste so fabulous but I absolutely love this recipe! I suggest using shredded swiss cheese instead of slices so you can put as much or as little as you'd like.

I was pleasantly surprised!!  I wasn't sure how it would all work together, but somehow it does.  I had boneless skinless filets so my cooking time was way shorter, also I had shredded Swiss cheese, so sprinkled that on and just put it back in the oven for a few minutes-would definitely make this again!

My son made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it.  Nice medley of flavors and very moist.  He sliced yukon gold potatoes and put them in the pan to roast with the chicken.  In addition, he sautéed sliced zucchini with the mushrooms.  A little fresh spinach was also put on top when the chicken was placed in the oven for the second time and before the cheese.  So delicious!!!

Such a good idea! My fiance has been cooking a lot for me lately so I wanted to do something special for him. After reading some of the reviews I decided it was best to do the whole putt on the ingredients and chicken in a bag to marinate. For my marinade, I used the full amount to do half of the serving size because we like our chicken a lot more flavorful! Instead of using cajun seasoning and garlic cloves I used garlic powder, red pepper flakes, paprika, and montreal chicken seasoning. Seemed to work great, it was so flavorful! Instead of using green onions, I sauteed mushrooms and white onion in a skillet and after cooking the chicken for 30 minutes, put that on top then layered some swiss and popped it back in the oven for a few minutes to melt. Was SO good, we both loved it! Had it with a nice rice pilaf and some pink mascato! Yum!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I used chicken tenders as it was on sale at the time. It was so easy and so delicious! I seasoned the chicken with all the seasonings and olive oil and baked in uncovered for 15 minutes. I then mixed together onions, garlic, cream of mushroom soup, mushrooms, and one cup almond milk. I whisked it together and poured it over the tenders. I then baked it covered with foil for 25-30 minutes. The chicken was so tender it could be cut with a fork.

Great recipe, so easy and the whole family loved it!  I marinated the chicken, garlic, olive oil, cajun seasoning in a bag as others suggested.  The chicken came out a little dry.  I'd recommend to cover it during the first 30 minutes.  I'd also double the mushrooms to make sure you get a mushroom in every bite.

Love this chicken we are big mushroom and swiss fans and this was really good and it was simple.  I took the advice in the some of the other reviews and marinated the chicken for about a half hour. I also sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil and salt and pepper before I put them on the chicken. Very good!

Very good. Only reason 4 stars is because you have to marinate the chicken with oil vinegar and garlic.  I also added some mrs.dash. Then added musrooms to bag when i put chicken in the oven with another tbs oil and vinegar.  After adding mushrooms cooked for 20 minutes.  Add cheese after that put back in oven and turn oven off 5-10 minutes later cheese will be melted.  Thanks for the post

Execellent! Quick & easy to make. The chicken smelled delicious baking in the oven - in fact my husband said he could smell it outside when he came home from work. Tremendous flavor - even my picky 8 year old enjoyed it! We will definitely put this on our menu again!!!

I am a new wife and still very nervous about cooking for my new hubby.  He was blown away by this dish.  I followed other reviews and shook the chicken in a bag.  I suggest this recipe to anyone who is pretty new to cooking.

This was an easy quick recipe to make. Could have used more seasoning, but other than that it was good. My family really enjoyed it. May use regular onions instead of green onions next time.

THis was the best chicken I have ever cooked.. a true crowd pleaser.. I have three children who are very picky , they were fighting over the last peices.. I spread alittle more onions and chopped up the mushrooms on top made a incredible looking 5star meal appearence.. this is a meal every cook needs to have in their book of tricks ..

I had to cook this in the skillet b/c I couldn't figure out how to use my Belgian oven.  I used Gouda instead of Swiss and I added a hot pepper.  It turned out very juicy and good.

This is very good!  I made a few changes, but nothing major...used red wine in place of red wine vinegar, to keep from going to store, added balsamic vinegar and Tony Cachere's cajun seasoning (if your in Louisiana you can get it at walmart..if not go online) Turned out great! Served with new potatoes and greenbeans with bacon and sweet onion tossed in a skillet....very yummy!Will definately make this again.

This is super easy, I love it. I have changed it some.  As suggested I let the chicken soak I combine it in the morning and its ready when I get home from work.  And my family loves veggies so I added some colored bell peppers that I had in my fridge and red oinon.  the peppers and red onion i sauted a little before adding since the cook time isn't long.  It came out amazing.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and the sauce it makes was wonderful drizzeled on them

This was delicious.  I served it with fresh steamed green beans, fresh cucumber salad, and fresh muskmelon.  A perfect summertime meal.  My whole family loved it, even my 6 yr. old.  We'll definitely have this again.

This is sooooo delicious and easy! Mine turned out better than when I get this at a restaurant. I also used the ziploc baggy to marinate the chicken and I also added another teaspoon of seasoning on top. Yummy!

I followed the recipe, using the plastic bag method others have mentioned to coat the breasts.  I used 3 breasts, but the full recipe marinade, and it worked very well.  My hubby said it was allowed on the "once a month" list (good), but I think next time I'll cut back very, very slightly on the vinegar.  Otherwise, very good - chicken was tender and moist.  p.s. I followed the cooking times and temps (closer to 375 than 350) as I'm at almost 7000 ft altitude!

I followed other reviewers suggestions and marinated the chicken in the sauce first.  This was not a huge hit for us.  It was just OK.  It seems to be missing something.  I probably won't make it again.

Not bad, just not amazing. I didnt have green onions so i used white ones chopped. The vinegar and oil was a little weird. Maybe because i LOVE cheese i thought there wasnt enough. I might make this again when i am having troubles coming up with something else or need something fairly easy... but not a fave by any means.

Very easy!  I was a litte nervous about the cajun seasoning for my kids, but I decided to put the whole amount in.  it ended up being flavorful without being too spicy for them, so I'm glad I did.  Yummy!

This was really good and easy. I also put the chicken in a bag with the ingredients. I had an emergency so it ended up sitting for an hour - that was probably a good thing. You could spice it up more. I added a little cayenne. I served this with couscous, which my family loves.

We thought it would be a good idea to add the mushrooms earlier because they weren't quite cooked as well as we had hoped for by the time the whole thing came out of the oven.  We might use a little more of the Cajun seasoning next time as well.

This was a good, easy recipe for my low-carb diet.  The Swiss cheese was good; it could have used more spice, less salty taste from the Cajun seasoning.  I will use more vinegar next time.

I made this for the first time last night, and I did not love it. It was good, but not great, although I must admit, I did alter the recipe a bit. I marinated the chicken for a while in the oil/vinegar mix, and I think the vinegar "cooked" the chicken, because it came out a little dry. Other than that, it was pretty easy, and I didn't have to run to the store to grab any extra ingredients.

I'm sitting here eating this dish as I type this (single girls do this kinda thing!), and all I can say is OH MY GOSH!! This is so good! The only variation I did was that I had some frozen chicken breasts that come marinated in tomato basil; it's what I had so I used them. They are to die for!! Thank you so much! This is getting saved to my recipe box in the top spot!

This was really tasty!  I liked the idea of marinating the chicken in the oil/vinegar mixture first, but I was out of plastic bags, so I ended up mixing the oil, garlic, vinegar and half of the cajun seasoning in my baking dish (as if I was making a salad dressing).  Then I turned the chicken a few times in the mixture and sprinkled the rest of the cajun seasoning on top.  I followed the rest of the recipe almost exactly, but I used gruyere instead of swiss because I like the stronger taste.  The finished product was incredibly moist and very yummy - not to mention super-easy.

This is a wonderful recipe!!!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and covered the baking dish while it cooked as well as placing the chicken, vinegar, oil and garlic in a ziploc bag.  My husband loved this recipe!  The chicken stayed very moist-this is one of the best and easiest chicken recipes I have made in a long time. Almost to the caliber of a gourmet recipe!

I am always looking for low fat and fresh ways to cook chicken breasts.  This was good, next time I am going to use more seasoning and remember salt and pepper.

Delicious! Husband raved about it through dinner, which wasn't a really long time since he gobbled it up like he hasn't tasted food in a week. Will surely be a regular in our house. The only thing I changed was leaving out the green onions, as a family preference. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was pretty good and very easy to make.  The flavors were very good; the chicken came out a little dry so I think I'll cover it while baking next time.  My kids and husband liked it.

This was very good. We had leftovers, so I poured the juice over the rice(I know it is very fattening) and had it the next day. We thought it was better the next day.

This dish was excellent! The chicken was very tender. It works with boned chicken as well, just cook it a little longer.  My husband especially loved how spicy the cajun seasoning made it.

This is one of my favorite recipes I have found on here.  The chicken is so tender and flavorful.  The vinegar and green onions make it slightly tangy and the cheese finishes the whole thing off nicely.  I cook this whenever I feel like something special, yet easy to prepare for dinner.

Not only was this recipe delicious, but deceivingly easy.  I served it with pasta in a light cream sauce that complimented the chicken without overpowering it.  It's presentation was elegant and put a huge smile on every face, including mine!  I feel that this recipe could be very easily doubled or tripled for larger parties.

This recipe came out wonderful.  It had great taste, and was very moist. For a variation, I used balsamic vinagar instead of the cider, and I used half swiss/half pepperjack rather than just the swiss.

This is a good chicken recipe.  The swiss cheese is a bit overpowering for the other flavors.  Next time I'll try it with possibly provolone.

Be careful not too overcook your chicken.
make sure the inside of the press is on the top that way the mushrooms won't fall off.
otherwise a simple and delicious dish.

A good base recipe.  Both easy to make and modify.   I use cream of mushroom soup as a base.  It would have been easy to add almost anything that would change the taste.

Just okay. The chicken breast is very tender and seasoned well. I followed the marinating advice given by many other reviewers. Good chicken and the mushroom green onion topping was good, but I could do w/o the cheese.

First time making this. Chicken was very tender and flavorful. I added some chicken broth as other suggested  and cut down on the creole seasoning as not my favorite. However it turned out to be very good.

The flavor was fine, and it was tender enough, but it was just "meh".

Needed to add the Swiss cheese with the mushrooms and onions, because it wouldn't melt.  I ended up putting the plates back in the warm oven to melt the cheese. Husband loved this, kids thought it was too spicy. I'll just make theirs without the cajun seasoning next time.

This is so fabulous.  For a single person like me, it's easy to change servings. I did make some changes: first, I used red wine instead of red wine vinegar--really excellent. I didn't have the onions, so I left them out. I cut the recipe size by half, but still treated myself and used a full 8 ozs. of mushrooms. I lightly sauteed the mushrooms before the second baking. The other thing was to baste, baste, baste. That extra step really brings out the flavor. Natalie, this recipe's a keeper!

This was pretty bland.  I baked it with some cream of mushroom soup to had flavor and a little creaminess, but it just ended up a watery mess.  Definitely needs something, but not sure what!  Love mushrooms & swiss though!

This was a crowd-pleaser at a family dinner - even the kids liked it. I prepared it ahead and put it in the fridge until dinner time. Next time I would double the garlic, oil, vinegar and seasoning though. Lemon-pepper seasoning or lemon zest might taste well with this as well!

This tasted good, but not great or exiting. It was just another one of those easy chicken recipes with decent flavor. I added balsamic and lots of salt pepper and cajun seasoning. The chicken did come out very tender though. Next time, I will take another reviewers advice and make these into sandwiches.

Made this tonight, for the second time, much better..the only thing I did different was using less cajun seasoning because my husband cant eat super spicy foods. Definitely put everything in a bag before you cook so it all gets distributed evenly.

I used canned mushroom since that was all I had, but otherwise I made it as directed.  I poured some of the juice off at the end before adding the cheese.  I think next time I might add a bit more seasoning (salt/pepper and maybe some italian seasoning) and more cheese.  Thanks!

We loved this recipe.  My husband is not big on chicken, but loved this and asked me to make it again.  I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used a chicken rub instead and it came out great.

We loved the mushroom, cheese, and chicken combination.  I am going to go a little easy on the Cajun spice and the garlic next time.  Otherwise it was really good and it looks like something from a restaurant.  We used mozzerella shredded cheese and it still tasted really good.

I wanted to like this because I had high expectations and my husband loved it - but I just didn't. I didn't like how the flavors fused... and thought the cajon seasoning was a bit much.

This was great!  I was skeptical while it was cooking - the vinegar and garlic smells were so strong, but it turned out delicious.  I would even make it without the swiss cheese.  My husband loved it and says it's a keeper.

You MUST try this recipe!  My chicken breasts were large, so I cut them in half (keeping them thick and juicy).  I've passed this recipe along to my co-workers, who are now hooked too.  My husband asked for this twice in the same week... and he HATES bs breasts!  A boring name for a fab-u-lous meal!
