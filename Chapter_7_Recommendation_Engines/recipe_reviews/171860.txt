This was pretty good, although mine was not moist it was fairly dry.  I used 2 cups of zucchini because that's what I had frozen.  Don't keep self-rising anything on hand, so I added 1 tsp baking powder and another 1/4 tsp of salt and it worked fine. Next time I would increase the sugar to about 1/4 cup because I prefer my cornbread a little on the sweet side. The cottage cheese gave it a very different flavor.

This was so moist and not what I expected. I had lots of fresh green beans and tomatoes from my garden and this was a perfect cornbread to go with them.

We really liked this cornbread. It was a great side with our tortellini soup. I have never seen self rising cornmeal in California, so used regular and added baking powder and soda. I added a bitmore sugar and green onions were all I had, so used those instead. They worked and made the flavor yummy. I will make this again.

Very good.  Excellant way to use up those big zucchini that get away from you!! Tasty and moist.  Will be doing this again. I didn't have the self rising corn meal or flour so added some baking powder and a little extra salt.  I used 2 eggs from my chickens but had a two yolk egg so it added a little more to richness of the corn bread. This is not your usual corn bread. Mine was very dense but flavorful. Not dry at all.

A pan of deliciousness. The zucchini and onion kept it moist. I added a bit of garlic and the salt I used had a bit of chili in it.  This is my new go to recipe

Found it lacking in flavor and didn't feel the zucchini added much.  Texture came out a bit too moist (top was well browned and toothpick came out clean so it was cooked as near to perfection as possible--maybe an oven issue).  Sugar could have been doubled for our taste.

I would definitely make it again but I think next time Iâ€™ll either add more zucchini or some shredded carrots.

This was just okay. I didn't have any self-rising flour/ cornmeal, so I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder as suggested by another reviewer. I also added 1 Tablespoon more sugar and less onion, making zero onion flavor.  I really liked adding the zucchini and everything baked beautifully in the skillet. If I do make this again I would add more sugar or maybe finish off with honey butter.

This recipe is so good! My mom informed me that she was not cooking for thanksgiving the day before :( so it was up to my sisters and I to cook dishes and bring over. I wanted to make corn bread just a little different so I found Zucchini cornbread on this site. This is my first time making cornbread from scratch and after purchasing the ingredients, preparing and making this cornbread it tasting and looking amazing,I will be making again :)
