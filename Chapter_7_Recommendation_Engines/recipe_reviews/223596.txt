This was delicious! It was a bit greasy, I would probably save this for a comfort food day.  However, that being said I think it would be an easy recipe to trim down with turkey bacon rather than regular, and then using a bit of cooking spray or veg. oil instead of the grease.  You could also substitute light cheese.  

As is though, this is a great recipe.  The sweet onion topping went great with the salty bacon & cheese.  Highly recommend trying this one.

This is awesome.  The only problem I had was cooking the chicken breasts because they were large and I could only cook one at a time so it took longer to make, but well worth it.  This would be a great recipe also to serve for guests; I would just make everything ahead until you get to the last steps to save time.

Made with turkey bacon and just added olive oil to sub for the bacon drippings. Was not greasy at all. I also dipped the breasts in milk to get better coverage of the flour/ breadcrumb mix before coating and putting in the pan. Probably had some extra red pepper and that was a great complimentary flavor. I'm awful at cooking so this isn't saying much but this is the tastiest thing I've made yet.

Yum! My chicken wasn't greasy at all. I barely had any grease left from my bacon but it was just enough to brown the chicken. Just deelish! Thanks for your modifications.

I think it would have been better if it had been creamy...maybe next time I will mix the cheese with crm o' mushroom soup and bake with the bacon & carmelized onions, versus cooking in the skillet.

My family destroyed this recipe last night. I was so happy with it. I switched a few things up, like using pre-cooked bacon and cooking the chicken in EVOO rather than the bacon drippings. It was still really greasy, but delicious and filling. I paired with sauteed mushrooms - seasoned with Italian seasoning and a pinch of garlic salt and parsley flakes - and peas. I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Delicious.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.   Very good flavor combination with the lemon-pepper, italian seasoning, and carmelized onions.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good.  Some have served it with creamy side dishes and complained about the greasiness.  We loved it with the caramelized onions spooned  over plain rice.

Made it tonight.  Loved it.  The onion sauce gets a little sticky/crunchy in the oven which made it even better in my opinion.  Will definitely make this again!

I left the bacon and sugar out and changed the cheese to Parmesan because that was what I had on hand.  This was delicious and I can only imagine the bacon would have put it in the 10 star range.  Thank you, Stephanie.  This is a keeper!

The only changes I made:  I did not flatten chicken breasts & made extra caramelized onions.  Good leftover but better the first night. Served with basic dinner salad (cuz it was the star of the show.)

I give this dish a 5 because it was great.  The lemon and pepper mixed in with brown sugar and rest of the ingredients gave it a unique flavor which both my wife and I enjoyed. we served the chicken with rice as a side dish.

I made this tonight and it was a huge hit.  I followed the recipe mostly as written except I didn't use the reserved bacon drippings I substituted canola oil instead.  I used Panko bread crumbs with a one to one ratio with the flour, to give the coating a bit of crunch. Always allow your breaded meat to rest 15 - 20 minutes before cooking - it will help the breading to stick to the meat better.  Cut back on the red pepper flakes if you don't tolerate spicy. The sweet and spicy caramelized onions along with the crunchy bacon go really well together, however, next time I think I'll cut down on the brown sugar a bit.  It was a moist, juicy, crunchy, cheesy, delicious bit of goodness!  Family said it's a keeper!

Great dish, and I made as written except I dipped the breasts in milk then flour as another commenter mentioned.  I'm calling this decadent chicken because it is so flavorful and juicy with great flavors and it is not a low-fat dish.  I got a nice compliment from the hubby.  I'll be making this again.

I followed the recipe (omitting the red pepper flakes) and it was a HUGE hit with my family. I am going to add mushrooms with the onions when I try this again. Definitely a recipe I will use again.
