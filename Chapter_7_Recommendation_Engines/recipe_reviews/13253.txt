Review from Spain. Only Red Bell Pepper is missed for a true Gazpacho Andaluz. Also, when all ingredients are blended and liquified, most times you don't need to add any water or bread crumbs, because the vegetables give the accurate density; water and bread are used only for change density to more liquid or more thick, otherwise they are not used.

Excellent recipe!  And true to its originis, especially in its use of good crusty stale bread and in its omission of many ingredients that have nothing to do with the authentic recipe.  I am originally from Spain and live there part of the year, so my rating is based upon native knowledge.  One must add that it is impossible to create a good gazpacho using grocery store blah tomatoes.  This recipe calls for the very best, juiciest, tastiest tomatoes one can find, usually from a hothouse or family farm.  Thank you for including it, it jogged my memory and I will use it as soon as my tomatoes are ready to be picked.

This is a great gazpacho recipe.  My mother-in-law is Spanish, and she always made this for my husband.  This is the first time I have made it that he has been satisfied as to its authenticity.  BUT, don't add so much water!! I didn't add any water, just some ice (in the blender) to make it cold rather than room temperature. Otherwise, the flavor will be too watered down and the consistency will be too liquidy.

As I have been limited by the available publishing space, here is the follow-up to my recipe—it's nothing without the following serving instructions. On the side in separate bowls for self-service: Small diced green bell pepper - Small diced red bell pepper - Small diced yellow bell pepper; Small diced cucumber; Quartered sun-ripened organic red cherry or grape tomatoes; Quartered sun-ripened organic yellow cherry or grape tomatoes. (All above ingredients must be chilled and served at the last minute.) Small cubes of loaf stale French bread lightly pan-browned in olive oil - Ice cubes to be stirred in slightly to dilute the soup plate (refreshing and a nice visual effect) – And a carafe of olive oil. I recommend the Catalan Estornell; widely available in the U.S.A., the label has a starling bird on it – it's made from Arbequinas, a mild, sweet olive variety, though climate, altitude, weather conditions, and lots of other factors determine the flavor - or the Andalucian family's four groves, around Baena, in the Cordoba province, production of Núñez de Prado Flor de Aceite, their numbered bottles are available at Dean and Deluca; both these first cold-pressing organic extra virgin oils are pricey though not insanely so, but in my opinion are the best table (not for cooking) Spanish olive oils. ! Buen apetito! J.P.G.  The recipe makes 8 cups of soup (7 servings).

I, too, should have read the reviews before following this recipe.  I followed it closely ... and am left with a vat of pink bread mush with a slight gazpacho-like perfume.  I plan to carry it for my lunch at the office this week, topping each serving off with an additional hit of wine vinegar to supply missing "zing," but I'm not sure I will be able to stomach it for five days!  Very disappointing ... and such a waste of tomatoes!   I have had gazpacho in Spain, and so, was not surprised to see bread as a component ... but I should have known better than to make it such a LARGE component!

Just what I was looking for - an authentic Spanish recipe. I used about 1/3 bread and no water (except to soak the bread in) as the tomatoes and the cucumber were watery enough for my taste, but this may vary from time to time during the season. After 6 hours in the fridge during a hot day it was perfect (and wonderful to be finished with preparing the evening meal before noon!).

To my taste, this recipe has too much water and too much bread. Some recipes call for no water at all, no oil, and no bread. Gazpacho made almost entirely from tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, and peppers is best.

I was very disappointed in this soup.  There was very little tomato flavour(I followed the recipe faithfully), and I felt that the bread content overpowered  the soup.This had a little resemblance to what I had in Spain this past February.

I followed it exactly except for the water and bread.  This recipe definitely doesn't need 8 cups of water.  DON'T ADD WATER AT ALL!!!!  If this recipe didn't have it I'm sure it would be a flawless five.  As for the bread, I probably used less than 1/3 of a loaf of french bread, that was completely stale.  The bread added a creaminess to it, so I would definitely add it again.  Oh, and I also added a red pepper too, as another reviewer said to add.  Too bad good tomatoes only come in the summer!  I'd be a size two in record time!  I could live off this soup, it's so good.

Gazpacho is different anywhere you get it.  This recipe makes a nice creamy base. I like my gazpacho thicker so it was perfect for me.  Tips: Just use your blender or food processor in batches.  No need to dirty a stock pot. Pour the olive oil over the bread before blending and leave out the water except for a couple ice cubes right before you serve it.   I doubled the garlic, halved the bread and it made a very nice smooth texture with a body capable of supporting chopped fresh vegetable garnish. Fantastic fresh taste!

I wanted something to take me back to my month in Spain and this was it.  It's even better the second day.  Five stars.  My only changes: use a red pepper instead of green and adjust the amount you make because I had gazpacho coming out of my ears!

i don't know how many modifications i'm allowed to state before it officially becomes a different recipe entirely!  :)  a small backstory: i had the best gazpacho of my life at the (then) sheraton in key largo.  (never been to spain however i've eaten in a number of spanish restaurants)  i've been trying to replicate it ever since.   -used 8 tomatoes, skins removed but seeds intact -NO water -1/2 cuke is all i had -2 cloves of garlic -handful of cilantro -no green peppers on hand, used 1/2 of a yellow and 1/2 of a orange -no french bread on hand, used the "heels" of an old rye loaf instead; just the two small pieces -reduced to 1 tsp olive oil -about 1/4 cup regular white vinegar -about 1/2 tsp salt -added a jalepeno pepper ...and then blended the whole lot with a cuisinart hand blender (love that thing!).  other than that, i followed the recipe.  :)  definitely some gazpacho i can stand behind!  i think reducing (or eliminating) both the water and amount of bread allowed the tomato flavors to come out.  definitely try it!

I gave this a 4 because it is a true Spanish Gazpacho recipe. However, it can be improved with some more onion, garlic, and a little bit of ground comino. I also added more salt. I lived with a Spanish family for a while and that was how my "senora" made it. My consistnecy was fine and I didn't need the bread, and used only 3 cups of water. Serve it with Tortilla Espanola for a truly Spanish meal. Thanks for sharing!

This had good flavor and the wine vinegar is a must. However, I thought I could substitute the French bread for a whole wheat kind but it gives it a grainy texture. I would suggest using white bread next time so you get a smoother texture.

Not sure what I ate last week, but it wasn't that good. Very little flavor and very mealy from all the bread. Perhaps that if one has had gazpacho from spain, there is a base knowledge of what it's supposed to be like, so tinkering with it isn't a mystery.  I also think there's a lack of clear direction in this recipe. Tasted ok once i dumped a lot of garlic powder in it.

This is quite yummy, although of course I made changes. I'm giving the recipe a three, because it doesn't make sense as written. Eight cups of water?? For what? I'm wondering if that's the water intended for blanching the tomatoes (in order to peel them). And why put everything in a stock pot if it's not to be cooked? Anyway, I just peeled my tomates and stuck them in the food processor with the cuke, bell pepper and garlic. I also added a jalapeno and part of a banana pepper, then pureed the whole thing. I added about a quarter of a baguette, and I really love the subtle flavor of the bread in the soup. I added olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper to taste.

I love this recipe!  I am always looking for new soup recipes and this one was right up my alley, of course I am not as cosmopolitan as some, so I ended up heating this but only enough to take the chill off.  I believe that set the flavors off wonderfully.  My entire office is raving about this and I have already passed on the recipe.  Beautiful job!

This recipe is wonderfull without changing anything except the water, I just put water enough to move the tomatoes in the mixer. My husband is from Andalucia & he loves it in hot summer days.

Was looking to try a quick Gazpacho recipe and very pleased with this one. Didn't have time to go get flavorful tomatoes from the garden/farm (living in center of the city!) so I used 2 boxes (26oz) Pomi tomatoes (crushed). Turned out well (in my opinion). Used a yellow bell pepper instead of green (that's what I had on hand). Also, didn't add water or bread. Added a little extra garlic. Also, threw some basil and cilantro in the food processor as well. Very good!

Enjoyed the Gazpacho.  I omitted bread and oil.  Blended tomatoes over several batches instead of adding so much water.  I used about  half the water. I usually don't make so many changes but I'm gluten free ...thanks for sharing!

This is the only recipe I have found to closely resemble the Gaspacho I had when living for a week with a family in Seville, Spain. The lady of the house would soak the bread overnight and made fresh Gaspacho almost for every lunch. Love, love, love! This is my third summer using this recipe

This is authentic. I have a recipe book from Spain, I eat gazpacho daily when in Spain and I have a recipe from my family and this is the same. The only differences (and you can go either way but this is easier I find) instead of the water I use tomato juice. I also add a jalapeño pepper to kick it up and I use red bell pepper instead. This is so delicious and easy in the hot summer.

P.s. I see a lot of people having difficulties with the texture. The consistency of vegetables will never be the same.from one tomato to the next. The water (or tomato juice in my case) you add and the bread is to your preference. I prefer a more bisquey like texture so I put less liquid (6 cups) the veggies and the bread. if you want a thinner soup then add more liquid. The bread gives it a nice pink color and thickens it up nicely.

The weather was in the upper 40's and I could not imagine cooking or eating  warm food. Somebody in the waiting room mentioned gazpacho and I couldn't wait to go home and make a big batch which my husband and I just loved. I gave it a 4 as I thought it could use a little zing which we did with jalapeno's and lemon, we are eating it again today!

should have read the other reviews first...i agree - what this recipe creates is nothing like what i had in andalucia this summer.  there is very little tomato flavor, and unless you blend the c$%p out of it, it is a mealy bready mush.  even then it was very bland and saved only by the quick thinking of a chef friend, who turned it into something very very non-gazpacho.....
