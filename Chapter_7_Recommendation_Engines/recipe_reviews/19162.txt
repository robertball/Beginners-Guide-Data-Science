I served this at a Grand Opening of a business...couldn't keep it in the bowl, and I had two punch bowls going at the same time! Make sure that your frozen cans of lemonade & O.J. are thawed before hand.

Very refreshing! I used a passion fruit orange juice and I also made an Ice ring out of the punch to keep it cool and not get "watered down" with regular ice cibes.

This punch is almost perfect! My family likes to add 7up or sprite to this recipe to give it a little more kick.

It was very good I had to make more half-way into the evening.  This was adults.  I did use white cranberry juice just incase of spillage.

I have been looking for a punch to serve at a womens brunch and this hit the spot. Not too sweet, just a little tart and just a pleasant mix of flavors. A sure keeper.

This was pretty good and both my adult and children holiday guests loved it.  I took about a quart of this and froze it solid and placed it in the punch bowl to keep it cold and non-watered down.

Served this at a Christmas party this afternoon and it was very good-I had to make another batch.  But everyone thought it could benefit from some ginger ale or sprite.

Good all-juice blend.  Does tend to separate if you go with organic juices so be sure to serve from proper punch bowl and not pitcher. Easier to stir up in punch bowl.

I served this at my daughter's 2nd birthday party and everyone raved on how refreshing it tasted.  Even the older kids who are not punch fans loved it!

Okay not sure if I did something wrong- but this was not all that great-- and it didn't look appealing! We did half punch half 7up and tasted much better- but still really ugly looking. I will NOT be making this one again.

Great punch!  I made this for a baby shower.  I used extra pineapple juice and also added some ginger ale for fizziness.  It was so refreshing and very pretty in the bowl with some slices of lemon and orange.

This was a decent, basic punch.  My guests drank it, but it's not as good as some other recipes.  My husband found it too sour, probably due to the lemonade.  I chilled the ingredients, and no one used ice.  I added some ginger ale to make it a bit fizzy.
