for flavor, this recipe definitely gets five stars, but for the complicated and time consuming directions I'm only going to give it four. Just mix the mangoes in with the salsa and instead of grilling the entire sandwhich just grill the bread alongside everything else. This recipe is also really good with fish, especially ahi. I also added wasabi to the mayo ( I used veggie mayo) and it was really yummy!

This is a lot of work, but worth it.  My wife had serious doubts about it when I was working, but she loved it when we were done.  I want to try it as a wrap or as a quesadilla with the mango on top maybe.  Pretty messy to eat too.  I will use the marinade for chicken often.

I made it a second time as a filler during a rib cookoff and this time I made it as a quesadilla.  It worked great and got rave reviews.  Everyone liked it better than any of the ribs.  The tortillas were a lot easier to work with than the french bread.  The lime-mayo helped hold it all together.

Well! I made this recipe as sort of challenge from friends from the Recipe Exchange (hi!) - we were all a bit intimidated by the ingredient/instruction list. This sandwich is delicious and COULD be really easy to make, but is a bit complicated as written. I will make this again, because the flavor is excellent, but I think I will make a chicken salad with most of the ingredients, skip the mayo and the cheese, and serve it cold on toasted french bread. Thanks for the recipe - great idea! ;)

Yum, yum, yum!! Great blending of flavors, awesome southwestern style, can't go wrong with this sandwich!

Pet peeve warning: Why, oh why do people rate recipes that they haven't tried yet? Why do they substitute ingredients and cooking methods and then complain that it isn't what they thought it should be?

This is a wonderful recipe and should be acknowledged as such. 

Rant is done. :)

I am the recipe submitter.  I use a food processor and one of those chopping gadgets to do most of the complicated prep work and I prep all of the veggies at the same time.  It goes quicker than you think with these tools.  I usually bake the bread the day before.  If I need to save time I buy the Dole mango strips in the jar from the produce section and buy the stores french loaves and already sliced cheese from the deli.  Red pepper and onions are cut into strips like for fajitas and grilled in a veggi grill basket.  They can also be broiled in the oven.  The key is to get that caramelizing around the edges of the vegetables.

This was SO good. I am always wary of fruit/meat dishes, but I had some extra mangoes so I decided to try it. I agree with other reviews, put the mangoes in with the salsa. Instead of bread, I wrapped everything in a tortilla and put them on the grill so the cheese was melted and the tortillas were crispy.

I wanted to try this when I first saw it, but then I got a bit carried away with my AR friends and realized it's a bit complicated!  My approach to complicated recipes like these is to do things in stages, so I marinated the chicken and made the salsa yesterday. Then I grilled the chicken and cut the mango today. I didn't grill the veggies or make the mayo. I don't like mayo and while I like grilled veggies, I didn't think this sandwich needed it.  After eating it, I really like it, although the salsa isn't the type of salsa that's my favorite. I also think it is very complicated and as SunnyB suggested it would be a good salad. I love the mango with the chicken. Thanks!

This was delicious. I don't think I've had a chicken sandwich this good at any restaurant I've ever been to.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because this recipe was terribly time consuming and it created a lot of dishes. I did use French bread like the recipe said, but I think it would have been better with sourdough. Either way, make sure you have large thick slices. I cut mine too thin and they fell apart when I was toasting the sandwiches. I also made it on a griddle instead of a grill. It didn't seem to effect the flavor at all. My husband is still praising me for making this. Finally, I think I should have cut up the mango and put it in the salsa instead of slicing it. It's really difficult to get several good slices off of a mango because of the size of the seed.

My girlfriend made this for the 2 of us on a Women's Weekend away. This is BY FAR the BEST sandwich I have ever had! All the flavors went very well together. There was definitely a party going on in my mouth! Thanks for a great recipe. I've already made it twice myself and I can't wait to make it for friends during my next card playing gathering!

Excellent chicken recipe! Quick and easy marinade. I didn't make the salsa or grill the vegetables. Instead, I used the chicken in a chicken sandwich with avacado. (mangoes were out of season and not quite ripe.) Also, with it being winter and all, broiled the chicken on "lo" on the middle rack of the oven for 11 minutes (turning once). The marinade is amazing and my husband and I loved it!

Delicious!  I skipped the jalapeno pepper and  toasted the bread with the cheese on it.  My family loved this recipe.  Don't be afraid of the fact that others have said it takes a long time to make.  Even with shortcuts, the variety of flavors in this sandwich will make it worth your time.

Making this marinade, I thought there was no way it would season the chicken being so dry..was I wrong!  Not only does this combination add great flavor, but the touch of olive oil makes them very tender.  I did make my own mango salsa instead of doing the salsa and mangos on top. My family inhaled them.  Put into a pita pocket and that was the end of that.  Not a spec was left!  Thanks!

Just finished eating this amazing sandwich! The only thing I changed was using pineapple instead of mango (my husband doesn't like mangos). The salsa was AMAZINGLY good. I would have eaten it by itself if it wasn't too hot for my tatstes! I expected the sandwich to be just as hot, but I was pleasantly surprised when it was only slightly hot and did not ruin the taste at all!! I will be making this recipe again!

Delicious! This is so good! The salsa is amazing and the chicken is really good too. For me, the chicken/marinade could use a little less salt. However, I use much less salt than most people. 
We ate it without the bread. (Carbs LOL) It would be great over rice or over a bed of lettuce.

This recipe has made believers out of all the naysayers who don't like to mix fruit in their main dishes.  Great flavors, well worth the effort.  I made into wraps to enhance portability.

GREAT...but long as most all other reviewers state!  This is how I cut back on time slightly: Marinated chicken as stated but added 1/4 olive oil and a dash of cayenne as I didn't have any jalapeno peppers on hand.  Cooked in frying pan with red peppers and onions (too lazy to grill) and topped with the lime mayo and fresh salsa (yum) on a tortilla.  I nixed the mango...didn't have but would like to maybe try next time and also on the french bread.  Yummy!

Loved the flavors!  Cooked it all in a skillet, skipped the mayo and cheese and just loaded it into tortillas to make wraps.  The chicken was awesome, and I mixed the mango in with the salsa and my 6 year old loved it all!

SO good!  But yes, complicated.  Honestly, I didn't marinate the chicken...I was too hungry.  I ended up sauteeing the chicken tenderloins in all of the ingredients of the marinade (minus jalapenos, don't like too spicy) and that was really tasty.  
It was a cold October night, so I didn't grill any of it-all indoors. I skipped the grilled veggies because I am not a fan of red peppers and I felt the salsa had plenty of onion, IMO.  The sandwich was still Amazing. I don't know how anyone could get all those ingredient on there!  I had to use toothpicks as it was.  
Some changes I'll make next time- the lime didn't really change the flavor of the mayo and I made too much, so it wasted the mayo. Also, my husband suggested I cut the chicken into smaller/thinner pieces because it was really thick with every bite.  
I will definitely be making this again.

This was AWESOME!!!  Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of mango, but it was just the perfect sweetness to offset the spices that the chicken was marinated in.  It did take a while to make, but it was totally worth it!  And actually, if I had thought ahead and done the marinade the night before, it probably would've been a snap.  That's what I'll do next time (because I'll definitely be making this recipe again)!

I haven't yet cooked this recipe. However when I went to Washington state on vacation they made something similar with fish in which they added mangoes and pineapple pieces. I can't wait to try the recipe.

As a sandwich-A lot of work for a pretty good sandwich, not amazing though. However if you take all of the ingredients and make a Quesadilla out of it, OMG, amazing! A ton of work for a Quesadilla, but worth every bite!!! I rate it 5 stars as a Quesadilla!

Wow! Awesome!  So much flavor.  I made it pretty much as is, although it's a pretty forgiving recipe.  I put the mango in the salsa for convenience, but would have been great.  This is extremely tasty, and would recommend it to anyone, even if you don't love mango and cilantro (I don't love them myself).  The blend of flavors was just right and nothing stood out and shouted "I'm the star!"  Was easier to grill the put-together sandwich than I expected.  Can't wait to share this one with my friends.

The name says it all - truely amazing - so worth the time. Prepping (marinating the chicken, making the salsa so the flavors can meld) the day before really helps with the many 'complaints' about the total time. Tried many of the suggestions: diced the mango and put it in the salsa, the different breads, just making it a salad - all were fabulous variations! This is definately a keeper!

I cheated a little (okay a lot) and used Newman's Peach Salsa. I loved the combination of the grilled veggies, sweet and spicy salsa and the tartness of the lime. Will definitely make again.

This was really delicious. I only followed the marinade and the salsa recipe. I didn't zest the lime, just added the juice and used regular chili powder because I didn't want to spend $8 on the Chipoltle kind and it came out GREAT! My husband and I were quite pleased with how this turned out and would cook it again.

This is probably the best sandwich I have ever eaten. There are alot of steps, but you can prep the night before(marinate chicken, make the pico, and make the mayo-yum!) then you just have to assemble and grill at diiner time. I sauteed my chicken and veggies in a cast iron skillet and then grilled the sandwiches in the skillet with fantastic results. I can't wait to make theese for friends- good friends, they are very messy!

One of the best sandwiches I've had in my life! Ok, it did demand some more time to make, but it's not as complicated as it may seem. Once we had marinated chicken, mixed the mayo with lime and put all ingredients for the salsa in the blender, we only had to saute (we didn't grill) the chicken and vegetables, and put everything together in fresh french baguettes. So, this recipe is not "fast food" when making, but neither is it in terms of quality - sooo much better!

Excellent.  Sandwiches were a bit messy to eat but delicious!  I used my own home made salsa.  Thanks for sharing - it was a great combination of tastes!

This was delicious.  Now, since it was a regular weekday and I did not want to spend so much time in the kitchen, I simply cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and sauteed with the marinade/grilled ingredients, eyeballing how much of each and adding the cilantro last so it doesn't wilt.  I placed large tortillas in the microwave with a slice of cheese and let that melt.  I added the chicken, then the salsa on top and wrapped them up into a burrito.  Would the chicken taste better marinated?  I'm sure it would.  I would happily do that for company but for a regular evening meal I think I will stick with the way I made it.

This was AWESOME.  I am not a great cook, and this turned out as good as I hoped.  I used fresh garden tomatoes for the salsa, which helps.  I also omitted chili powder to lighten the spice.  But overall, I loved this dis.

OMG!! I am so in love with this sandwich! It does take a while to prep but it is SOOOO worth it! I added avocados, and that just made it perfect! I do not have a grill (New Yorker) so I cook the chicken in a skillet, then shedder it. This makes about to sandwiches worth. I cook the veggies on the skillet as well. Toast the bread a little before to prevent it from getting slaggy! ENJOY IT!! I LOVE IT AND MY FAMILY DOES TOO! I posted a pic :P

Great recipe! But a bit complicated if you don't have all that much time to chop everything up.  I think next time I will just use store bought salsa and toast the bread before putting on the mango and veggies.  Very delicious!! Husband loved it!

SO Yummy!  Make sure you use every ingredient, just the way it says.  The mango definitely made the sandwich.  Great for hot summer days, even the kids loved it!  This one is going into my "make that one again!" pile.

The mango really makes it! This was a great mix of flavours. Only suggestion is to dice up the chicken and mango. Hopefully that will make it easier to eat as a sandwhich. I had to eat it open faced because there was so much to this sandwhich!

This recipe is phenomenal. This is probably one of the most tasty dishes I have ever tried (or made for that matter!) I made this for my fiance and I and he could not believe how amazing it was. I used a lot more lime juice than what was required and I believe it made a huge difference. I left out the grilled vegetables because there was really no room on the sandwich. I was also leery of using mangos because I am usually not a fan of veggie/fruit combinations. But, the sandwich would not be the same without it. I recommend using tinfoil to line the grill because turning the sandwich over can get very messy. I let the salsa and chicken marinate for 24 hours. It won't take THAT long to make; it probably took me 1/2 hour to prepare the dish. Enjoy!

This was an excellent TASTING recipe (but I didn't include the mango) Only downside is that it takes a LONG time to prepare and uses so many ingredients.

Super delicious!  Not sure I should even rate this as the only parts of the recipe I followed were the marinade and the lime mayo.  I didn't make the grilled veggies or the salsa but it was still wonderful and I WILL make again. I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours and grilled on a Calphalon indoor grill.  I served on buns with a slice of tomato and lettuce with the lime mayo.  I served black bean salsa (recipe from this site)and a Rotel salsa and tortilla chips and it was a fabulous meal. I can't wait to have this again!

I made this recipe for my 5 person family and it was a major hit! Even my 10 year old cousin loved it. Though this dish takes a lot of time and energy, it is worth it in the end. All of the flavors work wondrously together! I would have expected to find this on a restaurant menu.
I had to slightly tweak the recipe, however, because we could not get a hold of any French bread. We made these into wraps using tortillas. Also, we do not have a working grill so we sauteed the vegetables and chicken on the stove. Even with this, it was delicious! I'm sure it is even better with the grill and bread!

This was an excellent recipe! Followed it with the exception of putting the mango into the salsa and served it in a flour tortilla.  Kids loved the chicken and that is saying a lot! I was worried the marinade wouldn't be liquid enough but it was perfect.  I did marinade my chicken for several hours.  Thanks for a keeper!!

These sandwiches were extremely flavorful and tasted delicious, however these were the hardest sandwiches to eat.  They were very messy, and we didn't find a good way to eat them.  Next time I would cut the chicken up into smaller pieces and try mixing everything together and serving it on thin slices of toast.

This was fabulous!! I used a pita instead of bread & I think it was a little less messy. I also made the marinade & salsa a few hours ahead. I will definitely make this again!

Fabulous!  Make the salsa ahead (put mango in the salsa) and marinate chicken ahead of time as well.  I made it as a wrap.  I would use jarred mangos and bottles lime juice next time for conveniece.  I would chop the  chicken rather small.  This was so good!!!

My boyfriend can't stop talking about this sandwich.  It is a little time consuming but it is so much fun to make! I got most of the ingredients out of my garden (the first garden I have ever had)!  Thank you so much for posting this.  I stuck to the recipe except I doubled the cilantro.

Husband & I LOVED this recipe.. only sub'd avocados for the mangoes (I'm the only fan of mangoes in the house), but I served it on the side and I used Colby Jack instead of Monterey Jack (couldn't find it in the cheese aisle .. could store have been sold out?!... Next time we make this we're going to use the soft bread used in gyros to be able to contain all that nummy goodness. The french bread just couldn't keep it all in and we had to wrestle to keep the sandwich together in our hands.

Many of the reviews here were talking about high time-consuming this was for them.  I really love to cook and I love my man to eat well so I don't mind spending the extra time especially when the ingredients sounded amazing and thought it worth the extra time.  The only bad thing I have to say is that it is really hard to keep stacked with everything in the bread with the thick pieces and the chicken and filling.  I think next time I might cut off what would be two pieces of bread and just cut 1 thick one off the loaf and create a pocket almost like stuffed french toast so that 1 side is closed, it may help to keep all the yummy stuff in!  The flavors of this were amazing.  Boyfriend and I loved it and I have to say Gratzi for the delic recipie!

I made this for my boyfriend and I and the flavors are amazing! The first time I make a reciepe I usally do everything exactly as is but on this one I made a few adjustments.

1. Used tortillas instead of bread because I had them on hand and I’m glad I did. I think the juices would soak thru the bread and it would be very messy. I created more of a soft taco then a sandwich. I still used the spread….just put a thin layer on the tortilla and then added the chicken/veggies and then topped it off with the salsa 

2. Did NOT use the outdoor grill. I cut the chicken into cubes and cooked it in a frying pan then added the veggies to that after the chicken was cooked, like a stir-fry. It worked out very well

3. This was my first time trying to cut a mango and it was a juicy mess. I decided to just add the few chunks of mango I was able to cut along with the not so pretty mush to the salsa and it turned out just fine. 

I will definably be making this again…next time I’m thinking about adding some pineapple as well.  If you are not into super spicy food you may want to skip on the jalapeño or use a little less. I can’t get enough spiciness; my boyfriend on the other hand will start to “breathe fire” as he puts it. This was a little hot for him but he still scarfed it down and went back for seconds.

This recipe makes a really fantastic chicken sandwich!  One caveat--it takes a long time prepare.  My husband and I agree that the salsa, while very good, is unnecessary because of all the other flavors going on in this recipe.  I marinated the chicken for about three hours and used lime juice instead of lime zest.  We will definitely be making this again.

I used tortillas instead of bread, warmed on the grill. I also had read that peaches are a good substitute for mangoes, and as they are in season I used them instead and grilled them for a few minutes along side the vegetables to bring out the sweetness...really similar to a ripe mango. I have a salsa recipe which has the exact ingredients as this recipe that I had canned last summer, and used that, so it really cut the prep time. If you're going to use tortillas I would suggest 50% more chicken  as there was only enough for 4 with 1 pound.

This was amazing! We didn't have french bread or mayo in the house so we used corn tortillas and put it in a taco vs. a sandwich and it was a huge hit. Perfect even without the mayo. As others said, we added the mango to the salsa.

Very yummy.  Four stars as it takes a fair amount of work, yet isn't fancy for company.  I served to good friends and they liked it and didn't mind the messiness.  O itted cheese as I didn't have it.  Diced mango instead of slices and grilled bread, but not entire sandwich.  Had all items on table, allowing guests to make own sandwich and choose how much of each ingredient to include or to eat separately.  Next time I might sub a freshly made salsa or brand like Salsa Lisa from the store as the salsa in this recipe is fairly standard and add in the chipotle to get smokiness with less work.  I might make this as a chicken salad, dicing up the chicken and grilled veg, to make it easier to eat.

This sandwich was amazing, but be careful with the onions and garlic. I used half of what the recipe called for and I still thought it was a little too much. But other than that, it was sooooo good!!

Awesome recipe and VERY flavorful! I loved this recipe and made it for my whole family. Anything but an ordinary sandwich and when all is done and put together it's well worth the time. I didn't find it confusing at all just follow the directions in order how it's written and you shouldn't have any problems. Deff 5 stars!

I tweaked this recipe a bit; I used a prepared Mexican marinade to save time, and I put it on sundried tomato-basil wraps instead of bread.  My family loved it!  My sister, who eats out several times a week, said it was restaurant quality!  I used both light and dark meat chicken, and I cut it into strips before cooking to save a step, and took it off the grill just as soon as the largest strip wasn't pink.  I only used one mango (didn't write down my shopping list-again) it was subtle and sweet, next time I'll use two.  Had the salsa on the side, to reduce the mess.  Definately will make again!

This dish has an amazing flavor, but I agree with others who say that the recipe is a bit too complicated. It was not too difficult to make, but the steps here were unnecessary. I prefer to do a lot of my cooking in the skillet, which is usually a fine substitution for the grill. I chose to put my mango in the salsa, which turned out great. I will proabably make this again, but it's not likely to make it into the usual rotation.

This sandwich is worth the work.  None of the steps are difficult, there are just a lot of them.  I like to marinate the chicken overnight.  I also like to make the salsa the day before so the flavors can mix together.  These sandwiches never last long at my house!

This recipe literally had my taste buds dancing in my mouth!!!
Being a short order cook, I simplified the recipe for the kitchen. Do yourself a favor and keep the recipe simple by using  dried cilantro flakes, a jar of jalapeño slices,  lime juice from the plastic lime (lol!), minced garlic from a jar (produce section),  sautée the chicken and veggies in a skillet together, use flatbread ( your choice), and use shredded cheese. 
 I doubled the marinade to provide enough coverage for the chicken. I then sautéed the chicken and veggies in the same skillet over medium high heat to save time and mess.  Like others, I used flatbread ( or tortillas or pita bread) instead of french bread. The flatbread saved the pain of grilling and worrying about this marvelous recipe falling into the fire. I also diced the mango and put into the salsa. I used shredded cheese to keep it simple. To finish, I used a thin spread of the lime mayo on the bread, added the chicken and veggies and topped with salsa and shredded cheese. 
It's been a hit every time I made it!!!

I have never actually made the full recipe but use the marinade for chicken fajitas. They are amazing. Throw a few peppers and onions on the grill with it and they are amazing!!

Tried this last night.  Don't be intimidated by the list of ingredients.  It is so worth the time and effort.  I did change just one thing and that was to add the mango to the salsa, thus making a mango salsa and eliminating the tomato.  Except for that small change, I did the recipe as written and it turned out fantastic.  Hubby was still raving about it the day after.  This will be a definite keeper in my kitchen.  Thank you Patricia for the amazing recipe.

Left out the jalapenos for the kids.  The chicken marinade was pretty good.  I bought lime juice instead of using fresh and that is where I goofed- the mayo mixture was way too tangy.  I used thick Italian bread and sprayed the outsides with olive oil then grilled on the George Foreman after assembling all the ingredients.  Loved the Panini type sandwich as a result of using the Foreman.  Will likely make again but will just use the chicken marinade with cut up mango, store bought salsa and the veggies (they were actually pretty good on the sandwich.  Anxious to try it as a salad also.  Fresh Lime juice is a must in this one!

Marinade for the chicken was great!  We don't use jalapenos often so was worried about the heat but it wasn't hot at all ... my mom & her husband even liked it.

Served the chicken separately, with a little melted Monteray Jack on top and it was delicious.  BUT when you put the salsa on top (we added mango directly to salsa) everyone loved it!  Even my picky eater who at first didn't want to try the salsa ... teenagers - go figure.

This sandwich is so good, it just sent me into a grilled sammy frenzy!! Unfortunately, I used the mangoes I had for something else, so I used mango chutney instead. But stuck to the recipe for everything else. I did marinate for like 4 hours, idk if that made a difference or not. And I used a really good sourdough instead. This sammy rocked! Way to go Patricia for using what's in the pantry and fridge for an awesome meal. It inspired me!

I made a few modifications and loved the recipe.  
To start i left the bread and the mayo off.  I marinaded the chicken breast and served it with the mango and salsa.  I added mango to the salsa and swapped the chipotle for regular chile.  I served the chicken with a thick slice of mango and the salsa piled on top.  
I grilled zuccini, red pepper, onion, and cherry tomatoes and crumbled some loose feta on top.  
It made for the most fantastic summer meal and it took less time then prepping the sandwiches.  With all of the fresh veg it tasted great and is a healthier alternative to the cheese, bread, and mayo.

It took us forever, it seemed, to prepare everything for this meal!  But, oh my!  Was it alllll worth it!!  It was incredible!!  A few things we'll do differently next time: Either cut the French (long skinny) loaf into subs or try to find a thicker loaf. And the biggest change: we'll give ourselves much more time to prepare it in!  But again, so worth it :) - - Also, the video posted was helpful!  Worth watching!

I didn't think the flavors went together at all, and with the french bread the sandwich was too big to grill without it falling apart, let alone actually eat. will not be making again.

This sounds really complicated but it's not. Instead of chipotle powder, I mince 1 chipotle pepper in adobe sauce and cut out the jalepeno so it's not too spicy. I grill the pepper and onion along with the chicken in a grill basket. I just add the mango right to the salsa mix. I also use fat free greek yogurt in place of mayo. Tastes great and less fattening. I usually get a jalepeno cheddar or salsa foccacia from the grocery store. I grill the bread for a few minutes then assemble the fixings. There really is no need to put back on the grill.

I cut up the mango into the salsa instead of keeping it separate so I'd get some in every bite. I recommend this recipe if only for the salsa alone!

I thought there was too much salt in marinade and salsa- will cut in half next time. I didn't have chipotle chile powder so i subbed ground ancho chili pepper (tasted great). I added some water to the marinade (1/4 c) to make it easier to distribute around the chicken in the bag.

Lost of work, but great use of a bunch of stuff I had on hand. for my personal preference - less mayo would have been better.  

Also, I didn't get the sandwiches grilled - may have helped. Will try as a wrap next time.

Thank you for submitting this recipe. It was delicious. Enjoyed by my toddler on up to the adults. I subbed chicken thighs for the breasts, because they tend to be juicer when grilled. This recipe was great. We ate the sandwiches on ciabatta rolls. Although it was time consuming to prep, the end result was definitely worth it!

This is the most delicious sandwich I’ve ever eaten! It’s a lot of work, but totally worth it! If you enjoy sharing the cooking experience with someone, this is a great recipe for allowing two people to complete different steps at the same time. Get into the kitchen/out to the grill and have some fun!!

This was so good!  I made the salsa and marinated the chicken the day before. It was too cold outside for grilling, so I just baked the chicken in the oven, grilled the veggies on the stove and toasted the bread.  I added the diced mango to the salsa. After the chicken was cooked, I topped it with the veggies and cheese and put it back in the oven until it melted. then added the salsa.  I will definitely be making this again!

The mango was just sweet enough to balance the spicy, and the chicken and grilled peppers held their own too. I've made this recipe several times with different variations and I recommend sticking to the recipe. There are a lot of flavors and they all complement each other.

Made this exactly as written except baked the chicken and vegetables instead of grilling for 35 minutes at 375. I also used rolls instead of French bread. This was an amazing sandwich. So many flavors! Lots of steps but worth it

As others have noted, the flavor of this sandwich is amazing, but somewhat time-consuming to make. I've made it several times and it's much easier to add the mango into the salsa, does not detract from the flavor at all. I usually grill the chicken indoors and then cut into thin slices to make it easier to eat. I've tried different kinds of bread and have decided my favorite is a Kaiser roll. I slice the top off and hollow out the bottom part so I have a "boat" to put everything in. I use one chicken breast and half the salsa recipe and it makes four to six Kaiser sandwiches. I put the sandwich under the broiler for a minute or two to melt the cheese but watch out! The first time I made this the cheese caught on fire! Also, I only add a couple of teaspoons of lime juice to the mayo, not Tbsp. as listed and add a sprinkle of chili powder as well.

Holding the sandwich together while grilling borders on impossible, but the flavor is great. Next time I make it I think I'll grill the bread and cheese separately and then add on all the other ingredients after.

This is one of the best recipes that I've tried on here. It is labour intensive but it is worth it. We will definitely be having this again.

Restaurant quality.  I made as written except I used colby jack cheese and served on kaiser rolls.  I also used my oven instead of a grill.  These were time consuming and quite messy, but absolutely delicious.  Fantastic, I'd say.

Next time, I'll dice the mango and put it in with the salsa, but that is the only change I'll make.  I baked the chicken at 450 for about 20 minutes and it is good enough on its own to be a main dish, so I will likely use the chicken part of the recipe for other dishes, as well.  

The hubs demands I put this into the rotation, and I do believe it's earned a spot :-)

Amazing?  YEP!!!!  I asked my son:  If you were at a restaurant, would you order this again?  His response -- no doubt...on the same night!

Didn't quite follow the recipe exactly but not completely on purpose.  Intentionally used a couple+ tablespoons of jarred chipotle peppers instead of the chipotle chili powder in both the marinade and the salsa.  YUM!  Not on purpose, forgot to tell hubby to pick up cilantro at the grocery store so we didn't have that -- can't wait to include it next time.  Also cooked the fully sliced onions and red peppers on the grill in a grill pan -- perfect!  

The only thing I will do different next time (other than add the cilantro) is chop the mangos PLUS chunk some fresh avocado and add them both to the salsa.  The mango, monterey jack cheese and avocado help cut down on the heat -- oh so many AMAZING flavors!  I would also recommend grilling the bread with the cheese to get it all nice and gooey so nothing falls out!  

Yes it is a little time consuming to prepare -- if preparing for a crowd (total pleaser, btw) most could be done in advance -- thankfully both my son and hubby helped so it wasn't too bad for dinner tonight. 

P.S.  If you are a chipotle fan, try the Chipotle Crusted Pork Tenderloin from this site and sub the chili powder for the canned chili's and I promise you won't be disappointed!

Fabulous recipe. I made a couple of changes though. I used tilapia instead of the chicken and lemon instead of lime since thats what i had on hand. I used a wrap instead of the bread cuz i like it all wraped up vs a sandwich. It was awesome! Will make again next time im hungry n bored at the same time....

Great recipe!  I made it almost exactly as written, the only changes I made was using dried Cilantro instead of fresh because didn't have fresh on hand.  I bet it would have been even better with the fresh stuff.  Also, my mango turned overly ripe so couldn't use it, which turns out was just as good without it.  Next time instead of french bread I will use wraps, the bread makes it too bready for me, but it was good with the bread.  Never thought of mixing lime juice with mayo, and now love the concept.  Thank You for the wonderful recipe.

This sandwich was a lot of work, but we loved it!  Didn't have fresh cilantro but used cilantro purée from a tube and it worked great. I also didn't have any Monterey Jack cheese but used an Italian cheese blend instead.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as written and it was great! Like the crusty bread after grilling and the mango added just the right amount of sweetness.

There is quite a bit to put into this dish but it's laid out for us pretty clearly and it's easy to follow. Just follow it step by step. Combining your dry seasons together first removes several steps from the directions. The rest just requires a little bit of time that many people don't like to put into their cooking. If you are willing to sacrifice a little time and effort, the result will be amazing. The flavor is powerful and the seasons blend together very well. I didn't have to change anything with this recipe. Super delicious!

We've made this twice now, and my chicken hating son has loved it both times.  The second time I left out the jalapeno (we didn't have any) and it was still fantastic. I did add some water to the marinade the second time around, as it mixes into such a thick paste it was hard to mush it around and get all the chicken coated. I also added a tablespoon of the lime juice to help tenderize the chicken.

So great! It was a hit at our house. We had to make it on the stove...can't wait until it's warmer to make on the grill. Served with rice and broccoli...would taste great served over it without the bread! A new favorite!

The prep for this is time consuming but completely worth it! I followed the recipe exactly except I couldn't find French bread and used sub rolls instead. I marinated the chicken for 3 hours and the salsa married in the fridge for the same amount. Absolutely wonderful!!! I will definitely make this again!

Lots of prep, but VERY tasty!  I skipped some of the later grill work for time purposes but it still turned out great.  PERSONAL PREFERENCES:  I used chipotle cheddar Gouda instead of pepper jack and added coriander to the marinate which really intensified the flavor. I'm also a carb watcher so I used thin, white mountain bread instead of French. 

Fantastic!

I have made more chicken recipes than I have hair on my head. This is by far one of the tastiest grilled chicken recipes ever. I did make a mango salsa in lieu of slicing and/or making the tomato salsa, and the results were yummy.Tough to keep everything in my homemade baguette, but worth the dripping down my chin! Will definitely use a tortilla tonight with the leftovers!

I made this as a quesadilla and they were AMAZING!!  I put the mango in the salsa but followed everything else.  I put the mayo on the tortilla with the cheese, chicken (cut up after grilling), salsa, veggies and more cheese.  Grilled them for a few minutes and everyone gobbled them up!  Now I am craving more :)  Thanks Patricia for sharing your recipe!
