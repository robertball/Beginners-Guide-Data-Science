This is a fantastic idea, and a great base recipe. 

Now I don't know about you, but when I'm pregnant I want restaurant-quality food and I'll spend the time sometimes to get it. To make these taste like high-quality fresh mexican restaurant wraps, add the following to the original recipe:

1 large white onion
2 large red bell peppers
Lots of olive oil
2 T brown sugar
juice of one lime

I carmelized the onion and bell pepper together with 2 T brown sugar.  This took awhile, but it was worth it. Towards the end of carmelizing, add the can of corn to the pan and sautee it with the rest. Add some salt and pepper to taste.
(Since we didn't use the diced tomatoes, I just added one 4 oz can of green chiles to the mix towards the end of carmelizing.) Let this cool sligtly, then add the cheese to the onion mixture to help it melt. Mix with the rice and beans. Add the juice of one lime to the mix. Spoon into ezekiel tortillas or whole wheat tortillas and just to make yourself feel more like a chef, put a piece of dark lettuce under the burritos to serve.
 

I cooked 1 c of quinoa to 2 c water for 15 min then let rest uncovered in place of 2 c uncooked brown rice. This comes out to about the same volume vs. 2 c rice and is a complete protein grain in itself. Rinse quinoa well before cooking if you try it.

Healthy, hearty, easy and cheap!  I made a half recipe which yielded 10 stuffed 10-inch tortillas.  I do recommend the following additions (based on half recipe): 

1) season your rice when you cook it (try salt, garlic powder, chili powder) 
2) substitute good fresh salsa for the canned tomatoes; my grocery store sells a decent one in the produce aisle.
3) add 1/2 cup chopped fresh cillantro; in my opinion, this makes it!
4) add 4 oz can diced jalapenos 
5) add 1T ground cumin and 1T mexican oregano to the mixture. 
6) use a one-cup measure to fill the tortillas

This recipe is great -- I've used it more times than I can count! I love having such a healthy, filling meal available whenever I need it.  When I first started making these, I followed the recipe exactly (I rated it 4 stars), but over time, I've made a couple of modifiations to make these 5 stars!! If it's available, I really like to buy a 14-oz bag of frozen southwest vegetable blend (corn, black beans, poblano chiles, red peppers, and onions).  When using this mix, I decrease the beans to 2 cans black, 1 can pinto. Not all grocery stores in my area carry it, so when it's not available, I use 3 cans black beans, 2 cans pinto, and 1 10-oz can Mexicorn (with green and red bell peppers).  I started decreasing the cheese to half a pound quite some time ago -- I don't even miss it (I also use whatever kind is on hand).  I add a packet of Taco Seasoning to the rice before blending with the rest of the ingredients, and add a can of sliced olives (yummm!).  I love to serve Macayo's Taco Sauce over top -- made as described, and these are anything but bland!!  These are a must try!!

Awesome convenient, & healthy!   The basic recipe is a little bland, but of course you can tweak & add spices to your liking.  One extra step that I took and haven't seen posted is that I pulsed 1/3 of the bean mixture in the food processor before adding the rice & cheese.  Then I mixed the processed beans & all other ingredients together.  We liked that it held together a little better that way.  
Really, really enjoyed this recipe!  Thanks!!

wow, with a few adjustments (huge thanks to everybody's reviews!), these are FANTASTIC! it's just me and my boyfriend, so i halved the recipe. still, we used 8" tortillas and ended up with 15 wraps!  not that we mind, cuz they're so good :)  we added taco seasoning to the rice after cooking it, so the flavors could blend while it cooled. (i used the "taco seasoning I" recipe off this site)  also, we added cilantro (mmm...) and a 4 ounce can of chiles.  i used about 3/4 cup of the mixture per wrap (remember, 8" tortillas) and they are SO filling and delicious with sour cream and salsa.  thanks for a healthier, yet still quick and easy alternative to "lean pockets!"

Easy to make and very tasty. You will probably need extra tortillas, though...I mixed up a half recipe and it made 10 wraps. I have found that they are best when thawed overnight in the refrigerator, and heated up for about 2 minutes in the microwave.

Reading the ingredients I wondered how in the world this could have been so highly rated by so many people, because it seemed so ordinary.  I tried it anyway, and my family loved it.  I cut everything in half except the tomatoes and subbed mexican style stewed toms for the tomatoes and chilies because the tomatoes and chilies are too spicy for my smaller children.  They asked to have it again so I made another batch and froze them.  Even my toddler ate a whole one!

These are pretty good! I prefer to take my lunch to work rather than eating greasy fast food whenever possible. After all, you never know if the person cooking your food has washed their hands after their last lavatory visit, or scratched that unmentionable itch 5 minutes ago...... Anyway, these reheat well and are even better with sour cream and salsa on the side. I'll take one or 2 of these when there's no leftovers and/or I don't have time to whip up a quick lunch. They freezer burn rather quickly though. I suggest eating them within 2 weeks.

Hate to be one of those reviewers who made changes and then rates it 5-stars but I bet this would've been 5-star without my addition of one 10oz. can of Sue's shredded cooked chicken breast. This is awesome and I have a stash in my work-freezer & my co-workers circle like vultures!

I love this recipe!! I am not a vegetarian, but ocasionally I like to have a vegetarian meal. This is super-convenient to bring to work and heat up there or eat at home when it seems like there is absolutely nothing to eat. I added some Mexican seasoning (cumin, garlic, red pepper, chili powder, oregano, etc.) and it spiced it up very nicely. I also added chopped up black olives. My freezer will never be "fully stocked" without some of these wraps inside! I let 3 other people have a wrap and they all loved it (even though they originally grumbled about the absense of meat)Thanks!

As is, this is very good (hence 4 stars).  But to make it really amazing, I do the following:  before cooking the rice, saute some garlic and onion along with 1 Tbsp taco seasoning in some olive oil.  Then add the water and rice, and cook until rice is done.  I use 2 cans of black beans, 1 can of pinto (both well drained and rinsed), and a 16-oz pkg of frozen corn.  I use 2 cups of diced FRESH tomatoes (this makes a huge difference) and a bunch of cilantro, chopped.  I throw in a 4-oz can of diced green chilies and use 8 oz of pepper jack, shredded.  I do add a little salt and pepper to taste, but the way I do my rice it's already well seasoned.  I don't even bother with the tortilla, just divide it out into single-serving freezer bowls and freeze.  Pull one out in the morning, it's thawed by lunch, and just needs a couple minutes in the microwave.  I do this almost every week, and I can't get enough of it!

What an excellent recipe!  It is so filling, and it keeps well.  I like mine with Frank's Red Hot added as I eat.

Following other reviewers:
1) I halved the recipe and ended up using around ten or twelve 9-inch tortillas (10-inch tortillas aren't sold at the Hannaford near me).  The recipe tortilla count of 16 must be only an approximation.
2) The amount of cheese given is almost too much, and I love cheese.  Try two-thirds of the amount.
3) Add a packet of taco seasoning to the rice after cooking.
4) Substitute salsa for the canned tomatoes.
5) Use a 1-cup measuring cup to fill the tortillas.  (use 1 cup plus a little more if you have larger tortillas, then you get 14 from the recipe)
6) While you can reheat them in the microwave, they taste best if finished off in a toaster oven to make the shell a little crisp.
7) One-half of a cup of dried beans is equivalent to a 15-oz can of cooked beans.

I could not be happier with these wraps!  I read through the reviews, so I was prepared with extra tortillas and plenty of spices!  I did cut the rice in half, cut the beans in half (and switched the ratio as my husband prefers pinto beans to black), but left the rest of the ingredients as stated.  I cooked the rice in chicken broth and threw in both garlic powder and chili powder.  I also added cilantro, oregano, and cumin to the final mix.  I also added the teensiest bit of salsa (would have added about a cup but I was using the end of a jar).  Oh, and used jalapeno cheddar tortillas.  I ate one immediately but froze the rest for my husband's work lunches.  He had his first one today and to quote him, "a 5 by me."  I pulled it out the freezer to defrost in the refrigerator overnight, then he microwaved it for a minute or two today.  Next time, I'll be making even a bigger batch bc these are just wonderful!

Wonderful recipe.  Like most, I changed it to suit my tastes.  I left out the rice because the dish has enough carbs.  I made 1/2 recipe and only used two cans of beans and added a can of refried beans, onion, garlic, trio of sweet peppers, cumin, chili powder and cayenne.  The tomatoes were salsa spiced and the refried beans were green chile with lime, no fat.  The refried beans added a nice lime flavor that complimented the dish and also thickened and added that binding of ingredients (I also smashed some of the beans with a flat wooden spoon to increase this effect). Corn was recently on sale and I cooked the ears and cut the corn off the cob, it is so flavorful and sweet.  The trio of peppers added a little more color to an already colorful dish.  I will make this over and over!  Thanks for the recipe and for those who shared their changes or additions.

As written, this is such a bland recipe.  Taking the other suggestions into consideration, such as the taco seasoning and cilantro, this is a wonderful meal.

I was looking for a unique change up to my PB&J's and bologna and cheese sandwiches for work snacks/lunch, and this seemed like a good idea. I used Uncle Ben's instant brown rice, and added a good dash of cumin and chili powder to it while cooking. I also omitted the canned tomatoes with chili's and instead used a large amount (not sure how much, I got a big container at the deli counter) of pico de gallo. I mixed the pico, black beans, and corn together and added the juice of one lime to the mix. Silly me, I bought refried beans instead of pinto, so I heated those up and used it as the based spread on my tortillas. Oh, and for the tortillas, I used Mission's Jalapeno & Cheddar flavored tortillas. I wrapped all but one, which became my guinea pig. I cut it in half, and ate one part chilled and the other part warmed in the microwave for 30 seconds. It's delicious both ways. I just wish I had a side of sour cream to dip them in.

This is a great way to enjoy lunch throughout the week.  I halved the recipe and followed the advice of others, plus a few of my own additions: 1) caramelized 1 small onions with 1 green bell pepper and 1T brown sugar, added corn and green chilies towards the end of caramelizing process and added a dash of salt and pepper, 2) used 1 chopped fresh tomato with about 5 oz. salsa instead of canned diced tomatoes, 3) 2 cans black beans (didn't have pinto beans), 4) mixed 1/2 package taco seasoning into my cooked brown rice, 5) mixed cheddar and mozzarella cheese (that's what I had on hand), 6) added lime juice to the entire mixture, 7) served with sour cream.  My husband loved it, and only suggested the addition of a meat as a possible boost, but it's great with or without meat.

These do take a while to assemble, but then it is so great to have such an easy, delicious, healthy meal on hand!! I microwave them from frozen at 2 min. 30 sec. and they come out hot and ready. I prefer salsa and sour cream on the side.  We've had them in the freezer for at least a month, and they are still fine. I wrapped them in plastic wrap, then put as many as I could fit into a gallon size freezer bag. I ran out of tortillas but still had filling, so I just scooped a serving sized portion into plastic wrap and froze them sans tortilla. We'll just heat them up and put them in a fresh tortilla when we are ready for them.

The recipe as it stands is a great place to start!  Like many others, I cut the recipe in half and I got ten STUFFED burritos out of it.  I changed the seasoning a lot, and reduced the amount of black beans to 1 can (in the half-size recipe).  I used salsa instead of tomatoes with peppers, I added cumin, oregano and chile powder, I added cilantro (about 1 cup, chopped) and hot sauce, and I used less cheese, because I didn't have the full amount.  One other thing - when I cooked the rice, I stirred some "Southwest Seasoning" spice into the water - about a teaspoon.  The rice came out beautifully seasoned.  The first night, I just put some of the wraps on a cookie sheet, spritzed them lightly with canola oil and baked them for about 15 or 20 minutes at 400 F until they were lightly golden.  It was like a fantastic baked chimichanga!  The next day, I just nuked the frozen ones for 3 minutes on high and they were a great, easy lunch.  Including all the changes, this baby is a ***** easy!

Very good basic recipe. I used pico de gallo instead of tomatoes, frozen western corn blend with onions and peppers, 2 zucchini and chicken. I used a sal, limon and chile seasoning that is usually used for fruit.

I haven't actually tried these yet, but my husband has been taking these to work all week, and he loves them. I did cut the recipe in half, and still got 12 filled tortillas.  I only used black beans and no pinto beans.  These are great for freezing, and I know that this will be a regularly made recipe in this house.

Very good! I usually cut the amount of cheese in half to make it healthier. I used less beans per tortilla so they will all fit and I can easily wrap them up. I would buy double the amount of tortillas called for.

This was a good recipe, and makes a nice lunch.  Overall, these are not mind-blowing, but they are tasty and healthy.  Much better than something from the grocery store freezer section.  My husband made these for me and made a half recipe but used the original amount of tomatoes, which worked great.  He also used jasmine rice in place of brown as we had that on hand.  A half recipe should have made 8 burritos but we got 13 good sized ones. I just wish the recipe had directions for how to re-heat these after freezing so I would not have to experiment to find out.

These tasted pretty good, but I think the thing I liked BEST about them was how easy they were to make!  Since the recipe made a lot, we had the filling in our refrigerator for a few days and were able to make several quick meals.

Great idea.  Made these last week with some variations and enjoyed an easy and delicious lunch and snack for several days.  Recipe allows for variations depending on taste.  I cut this recipe in half and had a lot of filling.  I used taco sized flour tortillas which I like better than the larger ones.  I also used this filling for nachos.

Wonderful!  I can't use canned items due to high sodium content, so I had to use home made beans, fresh tomatoes & chillies and frozen corn; My black beans are still simmering - haven't even added them yet, but everything was mixed and prepared and I simply couldn't resist trying one.  I'm microwave illiterate, so not quite sure about how to go about heating up a frozen one, but will browse comments in hopes someone else went into more detail.  Great flavor!

Wonderful! Perfect to grab on a busy morning when I can't make a lunch. They are huge and I was able to make 20. Yummy! We like to put lots of homemade salsa and either green chilies or jalapenos.

A great way to keep healthy filling food on hand for a hungry family... this makes a terrific afternoon snack!  Wouldn't mind reheating instructions though (hence the four instead of five stars) ... we haven't yet been able to defrost/reheat the filling without overcooking the tortillas.

Five stars with a few changes:  used left over black beans from dinner at a Mexican restaurant, so they were seasoned, used salsa instead of tomatoes and included fresh cilantro.  Used less cheese and wheat tortillas to make it healthier.  Had them for dinner and can't wait til lunch!

This is a great basic recipe that you can play around with.  My family loves them; I wrapped them like burritos and on the side had salsas available of varying heat.  I love the fact they are so bland - have 6 grandkids of different ages; youngest ones do not like heat.  A healthy recipe the kids love!! Yea!!  And let me tell you, when you are watching six kids by yourself, just grabbing these out of the freezer is wonderful.  Thank you so much for this recipe; it is a godsend.

This recipe is great. I make these wraps and sometimes add chicken. The freeze great and can be wrapped individually for convenient lunch or after school snack. I've also taken several from the freezer, placed in a pan, covered with our favorite mango salsa and baked until hot throughout. Top with cheese the last 10 minutes. An easy dinner option. A great TEAM UP recipe.

My third round in two months!  I have been trying to stick to the recipe as written since it is soooo easy.  The first time, I used white rice because we had Chinese take-out the night before and we never eat the rice- plenty for the wraps and it worked out fine.  I usually make 20 with the filling as the tortillas I buy come in a 10 pack.  I bought all the ingredients together this time (except the rice which I already had) for a total of $12.08.  This makes them about 60 cents per HUGE burrito.  My teenage son takes them to school - 2&1/2 minutes in the microwave.  No need to refrigerate while in the lunchbox and it helps keep his drink cold. They are delicious with salsa and sour cream on the side. I can't attest to how long they last in the freezer as we go through them in about 3 weeks.

As so many reviewers have already stated, this was a great starting point, but I changed it up for more flavor.  I browned ground turkey, added 2 med. onions chopped, half of a green bell pepper chopped, 4 cloves of garlic minced, and about a half dozen fresh garden tomatoes chopped.  I also added to the pan 1 packet of hot taco seasoning mix and then the beans (I used 2 cans of Kroger hot chili beans and 3 cans of black beans) and 2 cans of corn.  I brought everything to a boil.  Then let it all cool and added white rice, 4 chopped pickled jalapenos, and shredded Colby cheese.  I put about a heaping cup of the mix into each tortilla wrap - it made 16 exactly.  The changes and additions I think make it a 5 star recipe - it tastes delicious with homemade salsa.  I put them in the freezer & am looking forward to having something healthy (and inexpensive) to grab for lunch or dinner.

This recipe is great!  Everyone in my family eats it and I love it because it is so healthy.  I omit the cheese and add a package of taco seasoning to the rice as it is cooking.  It gives it great flavor.  Also someone mentioned they add cilantro, which I do too and the flavor is wonderful.  Be prepared this recipe makes a lot, but it goes fast!!

I made modifications based on what I had on hand so I didn't have to go to the store. I used 1 can Del Monte zesty chili style diced tomatoes, 1 can black beans, 1/2 lb frozen corn, taco seasoned shredded cheese, 8 in tortillas & Minute Rice brown rice for four servings. I got 18 nice little burritos that are delicious. I kept the rice separate from the rest. I used 2-3 tbsp rice, 2-3 tbsp corn mixture & 2 tbsp cheese for each.  This amount of ingredients worked perfectly...I didn't have any leftover rice or corn mixture.

This is a really good basic recipe. I didn't have an onion or bell peppers on hand, so I couldn't follow the recommendations that people included; I'm sure if I had, this would be a 5 star recipe! I'm just glad for the convenience of a healthy and easy-to-prepare meal, easily frozen for later.

Note to self: 1 cup uncooked rice does NOT equal 1 cup cooked rice! I ended up with not enough rice because I thought it would be the same. 2 cups uncooked rice yields about 6 cups cooked rice. I did feel that the filling could have used some more rice, but that's because I accidentally left out about 4 cups' worth! Only worry is that I felt like the cheese was just good enough; if I added more rice, I'm not sure it would have been. 

Will definitely make this again!

This is such a great idea!  I made a few changes to suit my tastes and make it even healthier.  But I was very impressed with how well they freeze and reheat!  Super convenient for lunch!  I've had one each day this week so far! 
I used less cheese, Quinoa instead of rice (and less of it), added jalepeno peppers, onions, and used salsa instead of tomatoes.  I found "extreme wellness wraps" which are tortillas high in protien and low in carbs.  I also used fresh cilantro, and serve them with a dollop of non-fat greek yogurt.  Delicious!

Added 1 small chopped onion and 1 tbsp taco seasoning.  Microwaved one right away and it was great.  Froze the rest. Made 1/2 the recipe and it made 8 - 10" tortillas and 5 - 8" ones.  Will make great lunches with with sour cream and lettuce.

These are great - I can't wait to see how they freeze and re-heat.  I used a bit of taco seasoning in the rice, as another reviewer suggested.  I also halved the cheese.   Fresh tasting.  I may try taking salsa with me at lunch to put in--the burrito I sampled was a little dry.  A super, cheap, easy recipe!  Thank you!

I just made these for the first time and am very happy with how they turned out. I used chicken stock to cook the brown rice for added flavour.Instead of one of the cans of beans, I added a can of refired beans to make it stick together better. When I combined the beans, rice and cheese I added about 1/4 cup Frank's Hot Sauce and 1 tbsp of onion salt.  These are so tasty with sour cream and salsa - yum!

These were easy to make and deserve 5 stars for the convenience of a make-ahead/freeze lunch option alone. 
After removing the wrap, we microwave these for 3 1/2 minutes and they come out great.

Very nice! looking for cheap lunch.  I cut the recipe in half, used Mexicorn (it conveniently comes in 10oz size) and cut down the beans by a can because I didn't have two cans of black beans.  Added a Tablespoon or so of taco seasoning for a bit more flavor.

Delicious!  I used white rice instead of brown (personal preference).  I also added onion, cilantro and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I also added chicken (seasoned with taco seasoning) for protein so it would be a more well rounded "meal."   I also added sour cream inside before I rolled them up.   Super yummy!

These were amazing and so easy.  I added an onion.  I did not need 16 so, I just added one can of all the ingredients (plus the rice and the cheese.  It made a tone I was able to make 13- 8" wraps, plus I still had 1/3 of a bowl left when I ran out of tortillas.  I used the extra filling to make a casserole, just added a can or cream of mushroom, sour cream, extra cheese and topped with crushed tortilla.  Awesome dish!!!

These freeze wonderfully! I use them for my boyfriends lunch when I don't have time to make a sandwich. Just wrap them and place in the pan, seal side down so it closes. Then let them cool and wrap in plastic wrap. I skip the pinto beans and add chopped chicken breast instead. I also use reduced fat cheedar cheese instead of pepper jack. I add some spices such as cumin, chili powder and oregano for a bit of a kick!

LOVE THESE..Trying to eat healthier and this fits perfectly in my food plan. I love being able to have these on hand any time I am hungry for a healthy choice. For me it is a must to put in a couple cups of salsa. I didn't have pepper jack cheese and used low fat mozzerella which I usually have and it worked great. You just have to put in the heat with a little extra pepper flakes or salsa. I just sprinkled a little cheese on my wraps before I wrapped them up instead of incorporating it in the beans. It is so awesome to be able to mix up the ingredients and make the wraps as needed or mix and freeze. I could eat these every day and know they are good for me. The recipe is a nice base as stated but then you can put in what ever you want and change it however you want. Nice healthy choice.

I cut the filling in half, but used the full amount of corn and tomatoes, and added taco seasoning to the rice. I just take one from the freezer to the fridge the night before, then 2 minutes in the microwave for lunch, and everyone at work is asking what restaurant I got it from!

REALLY, REALLY good!  I made these to take to work...and am thrilled to have such a convenient and healthy meal!  I made these according to the recipe, with the exception of using chicken broth instead of water to cook the rice.  I put about one heaping cup of filling on each tortilla and came up with exactly 16 wraps!  Will definitely make again!

Very tasty.  I made some with cubed chicken, and some vegetarian, and instead of the canned corn, I had a frozen veggie medley with corn, black beans, and peppers.  I also added cilantro because I love that flavour.  I have to admit that I did get kinda sick of them because it makes so much (and its just my boyfriend and I) so I would suggest halving the recipe unless you have a big family to eat it all.  Also, if you can, I would suggest heating in the oven.  They can get kinda soggy in the microwave.

Really easy and really good.  I added a packet of taco seasoning just to add extra spices.  Makes me (almost) realize I can live without meat!  :)

This is a great make-ahead recipe! I am making them for the second time. They freeze great! For a quick lunch - pull a frozen one out of the freezer, defrost for 1-2 min in the microwave, butter the outside, then grile on your griddle until they are brown (like grilled cheese sandwices). My husband loves them like that. Then serve with salsa and sour cream. THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!!!

Excellent! I didn't have the tomatoes with green chiles, so I added some jalapenoes (I like some heat with my food). Also added onion and garlic to the rice when it was cooking, cilantro in step 3, and used tomato tortillas.

Thanks for this recipe, it's so easy to make, and you can get all (exept the cheese) of the ingredients at the can section of the supermarket - I like that.  I used 3 cans of black beans and less cheese, and it still tastes great!  Thanks again.

Amazing! 

I modified the recipe slightly following several different comments suggestions. 

I used 4 cans black beans and accidentally opened 3 cans of pintos instead of two (oops), but it turned out perfectly. I also used a large can of Ro Tel (25 oz) instead of 1-10oz can. I also had half a purple onion leftover from making dinner, so I diced that and threw it in the mix. I used couscous instead of rice (whole box), and added one packet of McCormick Taco mix while boiling the water. I also had some leftover low-fat mozzarella on hand (around 2 cups) that I substituted for the pepper jack. 

I had everything on hand except for the tortillas, but the store was out of 10 inch wraps, so I bought 4 packages of qty 8, 8" flour wraps. I used a half cup scoop to put the filling into the burrito, and it was perfect! I used all the bean mix and tortillas! 

I now have 32 individually wrapped burritos in the fridge, and two of these are the perfect size for lunch. Delicious with a little hot sauce and/or salsa.

I LOVE this recipe!! I cooked the rice with my taco seasoning and added some seasoning to the bean mixture. Next time I think I'll put some salsa right in the mix. My husband and I love it. I'm pretty sure my kids will too. I will be making this over and over. I love that I will have a yummy lunch on hand!!!

I modified this recipe a little bit based on what I had in the cabinet. I used:

2 boxes of Farmhouse Brown and Wild Rice
1 can chili beans with a cheese sauce added
1 bag frozen of southwest blend corn mix
1/2 bag Birdseye Frozen onion and bell pepper mix
I omitted the pepperjack cheese.

Instead of wrapping in tortillas I put in individual size sandwich back and then placed in the freezer in a labeled gallon size freezer bag. Now I can pull out what I need when ready to eat add the any cheese, meat, tortilla and anything else I may want.

Very quick and easy way to take lunch, plus frozen mixture makes a great ice pack until time to eat.

Seriously delicious. Had to fiddle with it... fried the rice (only had white rice) before cooking, drained the canned corn (with red and green Mexican doo-dads) and added it and some white wine to cook rice. You wouldn't think something this simple would be so tasty. Great, great recipe.

Ok, I didn't have any tortillas, forgot to get them, so I made a casserole instead. Subbed kidney beans for black beans, forgot those too, and added cheddar cheese instead.  Poured into a 9 x 13 casserole and topped with more cheese and one box of Jiffy corn bread mix (made according to directions) A little sprinkle of more cheese and baked in 450° oven until cornbread was done and mixture bubbly. Whole new meatless dinner idea!  Prettt tasty. Next time I will add more spices though.

I really liked this concept. Pretty easy to make, and always have leftovers on hand. It tasted really good when toasting it so the tortilla is crispy.

OMG...is all I can say.  I did add some chopped scallions, garlic, lime juice and cilantro as well as putting some taco seasoning in with the rice while it was cooking.  Added a little cumin too for extra flavor.  I could eat this plain...never mind the wrap, but a great idea...TY!

A terrific base recipe. To bump up the nutritional value (and ease of preparation), I changed out the rice for quinoa. I also sprinkled a minimal amount of cheese (and of course you can ditch it altogether). Then to make it taste Good (versus healthy, ha ha) I added a tiny tiny amount of Rick Bayless' taco seasoning. (If you add too much, it would be over powering And too high on the sodium content.) Just enough to taste it and give some complexity to the whole thing. HELLO new favorite lunch!!!

These are super delicious!  I left out one star because as written it might be a bit too bland for my tastes.  The first batch I made, I added probably 3 tablespoons of "Taco Seasoning I" from this website.  I had 10 large tortilla wraps and I scaled the recipe down to 10.  I still had enough left over for at least another five tortillas!  They were delicious with the seasoning, but I thought they could use a little extra.  Next time I made them I caramelized two onions, used salsa instead of tomatoes and added a bunch of chopped cilantro.  I also pureed a can of the black beans to make the filling a bit more thicker.  These are going to be PERMANENTLY stocked in my freezer!

These are awesome!  Lunch for a week or two.  I freeze em and pull em out when needed.  I'd be interested to add something more to the filling though.  Its good, but I think there's something that could make it great....I just can't put my finger on it.  I did enjoy them more when i ate them w/ some salsa and sour cream/plain yogurt.

These are great! I only made half the recipe and still had plenty of fillings for well over a dozen wraps.  I used whole wheat tortillas for extra fiber and added half a chopped onion.  Simple, easy, and healthy! Great way to start of the New Year right!

Can't complain about this one! Super easy to make and easy to adjust. "As-is" it gets 4, with more stuff inside and more seasonings it would get a 5.

So good! I made 12 of these up and froze them. Reheated one today for lunch by defrosting in the microwave for 6 minutes and then heating for 1 minute. So tasty and healthy! I added some carmelized onion to mine and it really enhanced the flavor. Turns out I forgot to put cheese in a few of the wraps, I would never miss it. I'm going to be keeping a constant stash of these in my deep freezer.

My neighbor and I made these together and split it between the two of us.  We both loved these!  Per other reviews, we added taco seasoning to water when cooking the rice.  Added a little red onion and cilantro to the mix.  Left out the cheese to make it lower fat and we didn't miss it at all!  Used high fiber whole wheat tortillas/wraps.  Next time we'll probably add a little jalapeno for some kick.  Great healthy and easy recipe!!

I made this twice.  First, exactly as written.  5 Stars!!  Second time, added some cumin and chili powder.  Still 5 stars!  Awesome recipe, thank you Melissa!  My coworkers are sooo jealous! :)

This is a great filling.  I reduced sodium by cooking dried beans, using frozen corn, using fresh tomatoes and tomatillos instead of canned, and stuffing pita bread instead of tortillas.  Still very easy to put together.  The pepperjack adds a nice zip.  Thanks!

These are good to have in the freezer, ready to go. I only used 3 cans of beans and it's enough. Also used white rice. It's good.

Absolutely Delicious! Very easy and healthy meal. Looking at the other reviews I did add taco seasoning. Also instead of diced tomatoes I used hot chunky salsa. My husband and I like spicy things he also put a little hot sauce on his. Excellent. Thank you.

These are delicious! As others suggested, I added taco seasoning to the rice after cooking to add some flavor and am really impressed with this recipe. Love the fact that they are just sitting in the freezer for a quick and easy meal when needed. Thank you!

Everyone but the 8 year old loved these.  They were super easy and quick to make (except the rice).  I only made 1/2 the recipe and I got 15 burritoes out of it.

Perfect!  Followed the recipe exactly, no changes.  Of course, hubby would prefer "meat" in these, but they are great w/o it.  Freezes very well for a quick lunch.

These were alright but I found the flavor to be a bit bland.  Knowing I have so many of these in the freezer, I wish I liked them more.  I would have thrown in a bit more spice.

Great idea and I have a freezer full.  I absolutely love the general concept and this is one of my go-to lunches now.  However, I'm trying to figure out what to add to make it really amazing; it seems to be lacking just a bit.  Lots of cilantro and seasonings are a must for me, but I think I'll play around with adding onions, more tomatoes, chiles, or hot sauce next time.  I used a one-cup scoop and filled 15 tortillas.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

This is sooooo good. I'm a university student and I'm always trying to sleep in to the last minute so most of the time I grab whatever I can and I'm always starving, but I hate giving into buying food. I didnt have green chiles, and i use black beans and kidney beans. I added a squeeze of lemon, about 4 tbsp. curry sauce, and some chile powder. YUM

These are great!  I made them over the weekend and the biggest challenge was finding a bowl large enough to mix the filling.  I dirtied 3 bowls before switching to a stock pot!  The only thing I did different was add a diced yellow onion and I gave each wrap a squirt of hot sauce before rolling them up.  I agree a little seasoning would have been good, but I am very happy with them as is.

I made a few changes to this.  I used a 20oz can of black beans and 2x20oz cans of red kidney beans.  I mixed them together and put 1/3 of them through the food processor.  I chopped 1 small cooking onion and minced 3 cloves of garlic and cooked them on min heat in 1tbsp of coconut oil for about 20 minutes.  I then added the corn, and the processed beans and mixed together, then added the rest of the beans, 1 tbsp curry powder and 1 tbsp of red pepper flakes and mixed well.  I put the diced tomatoes through the processor as well and then mixed that into the mixture, added salt and pepper to taste and let it simmer for 5-8 mins.  Lastly, I mixed the bean mixture in with the brown rice and then filled the wraps.  It was just enough for 16, as the recipe said.  I found them to be very flavourful, but a bit dry.  I'm not sure what I can add next time to make it a bit juicy, like a burrito, but this recipe is def a keeper.

These are constantly made for a quick meal when there isn't time to eat. Pop in in the microwave and it's ready to go. We (husband & I) have tried to lower salt consumption by finding cans that don't have salt included. The brown rice can be replaced with 1 cup uncooked quinoa. This adds more fiber and protein.

Made as is it's pretty good but when I add in the juice of 2 limes, a packet of low sodium taco seasoning to the cooked rice, lots of cilantro, and double the tomatoes and chiles it is sooo good!!!

Four stars on its own, more than five with all the fabulous suggestions of others: halve the rice; use brown jasmine rice; add 3 tbsp fresh cilantro, 1 teaspoon cumin, chili powder and garlic; cook rice in chicken broth with one pkg taco seasoning; made 20 8-inch wraps with 1/2 cup filling.

Holy Moley this makes a lot!  I used 2 packs of the burrito sized tortillas and got 20  LARGE wraps!  I had to farm them out to my dad to use them up.  They are excellent and very filling and economical.  I also followed another reviewers suggestion and threw in a taco seasoning packet with the brown rice  when it was cooking.  I thought I didn;t like beans, but this recipe made a burrito-believer out of me.  One note of caution: have a very, very large mixing bowl to combine everything.  It came to the top of the largest Pyrex bowl I have!  Excellent recipe!

I like the idea, and I'll agree with those who have praised the convenience and economy of this recipe. I divided the recipe in half (so I wouldn't be stuck with dozens of wraps if I didn't like them), and still came up with 14 wraps. The only change I made was using whole wheat tortillas instead of flour. As far as the taste. . . a little bland. Actually, quite a bit bland. If I make them again, I'll add some seasonings, such as chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, etc.  For a good sauce for dipping, try mixing one part fat free ranch dressing with one part salsa.

These are fantastic!  Instead of the tomatoes, I put in a jar of medium salsa. I could only fit about 1/2 to 3/4 of the rice in my HUGE bowl and they still turned out wonderful.  I ended up with 32 wraps (10 inch size).  These will definitely become a staple in our freezer for work lunches and even dinners when we would normally hit a fast food place!!

Very good! Great when I don't feel like cooking and a lot healthier than packaged TV dinners. I usally takes me 4 min on defrost to heat up in microwave. I usually use 1/2 the amount of cheese to make them healtier. You will need more than 16 tortillas! I get 30 to be safe.

Followed basically as directed and am enjoying these.  I did add some refried beans to the mix because I had them leftover in the fridge from another meal.  The only negative is that the ends that have little filling get hard upon microwaving (even if I wrap them in paper towels), but I just cut off the ends and not a big deal.  I cut the recipe in half but still made 10 of these.

I like it, but want to let it sit for a bit. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added taco seasoning to the brown rice. I added onions and red peppers to the pan with some olive oil and a bit of brown sugar before adding the corn and green chilies. I pureed the pinto beans with some of the black beans and the onion mixture. I added lime juice and drained diced tomatoes along with a good bunch of chopped cilantro. Right now it seems to need something. I wonder if I should have added more spice to the mixture, such as cumin or cayenne. I've already made the burritos, so will serve with spicy salsa after reheating.

This is a very good, very inexpensive way to make a lot of lunches ahead of time.  I followed the suggestions of the top reviewer and also added bell peppers and avocado.  A bit too much cheese for me (but I'm really dairy-sensitive), but otherwise they're great.

This was fantastic. I was worried I might need to add a spice or two, but the flavor was perfect!

Very easy,cheap and good! The spices were perfect. I didn't add anything extra but I did accidently grab Rotal Chili starter with green chili's. It made so much I've been eating it in a bowl with salsa and sour cream. Yum!

I love this recipe.  I love mexican so being able to have a mexican like wrap for lunch is awesome.  I have dialed this recipe back so that it doesn't make as much. I only use one can of black beans and one can of the pinto. I little less cheese, I find one shredded package of cheese is perfect unless I have some left over cheese I am trying to get rid of. I have added onion to mine as I love onion and it gives it some more flavor. I am a Weight Watchers lifetime member so I tried to use low calorie tortillas to keep it light but found these are usually too dry to handle the wrapping and freezing without breaking up or drying out.  Use regular flour tortillas and they will be fine.  I have also added more spices as I like my wraps spicy.  I have recommended these to my busy sister who is mother of 3 and constantly on the go.  Thanks so much for a great recipe. LOVE IT!

Oh my gooooooooodness this is such a simple, easy wonderful idea for lunch !!!!!!!!!  I did halve the recipe, I used 2 cans of black beans, 1 can pinto, 1 10oz can ro-tel diced tomatoes with green chilies, and used 2 cups cooked brown rice and one 15 oz can of corn. Dumped the beans and corn in the strainer, rinsed and after all the liquid drained dumped it into a large bowl then mixed in the rice.  I put a few dashes of salt and pepper in this mixture.  Mixed and then decided some meat would be good, so I cooked up a pound of ground beef with taco seasoning.  Laid out the large flour tortilla shells, spooned the bean and rice mixture, a   heaping tablespoon of the ground beef then sprinkled the pepper jack cheese.  This is the best lunch on the go you can have.  Thank you for sharing.

I changed the servings number to 16 (from the original recipe) I got 27 wraps out of this, and if I had more tortillas I could get at least 3 more.  I think next time I will add taco seasoning or something, but they are very good and easy to make. I love being able to pull them out of the freezer and throw them in my bag for lunch!

Good idea, but very bland.  If I make again, I will be adding spices and halving the rice.  I first tried to make it without the cheese, but the cheese holds all the fillings together.

This recipe is great and these freeze and reheat  sooo well.  I used carmelized onions and green pepper.  I used home made pinto beans, onion & green chile tortillas and frozen roasted corn.   This will be a new tasty yet budget friendy staple in our house especially for portable lunches.  Thanks for sharing this!  I have already passed this to others.

I like this with salsa instead of tomatoes, add some cucumber for a fresher taste, onion for an extra kick and some bell pepper for some crunch. I'm also planning on trying it with avocado.

Easy recipe.  I thought that things were a little dry after freezing them.  If you add some shredded chicken and enchilada sauce these are 5 stars!

I agree with the person who said this was a great base recipe- first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was 4 stars good ;) My husband loved them to take to work, but personally I think they could use a little spicing up and more flavor, so this time I used fresh, pan seared corn, and tried other people's suggestions of cilantro, cumin, seasoning the rice, etc, and can't wait to try them! Definitely a keeper, and very flexible too depending on what you have on hand or prefer

These are soooo much better than store bought freezer burritos! My changes: I made a half batch with caramelized onion and red pepper instead of the corn and tomatoes. I cooked the rice with salt, pepper, garlic powder and chili powder in the water. Used a block of pepper jack (0.65 lbs) and added in about 1 tbsp taco seasoning--they ended up with a kick that I like (probably medium spicy). They are easier to wrap and taste better on sandwich wraps rather than the standard tortillas. Amazing. 

To reheat: unwrap from plastic wrap and roll in double sheet of paper towel. Microwave for 1:30, flip, microwave for another 1-2 mins. EAT.

Seasoned rice with garlic powder, salt, and chili powder.  Added almost a cup of cilantro and some cumin and taco seasoning to the whole mix.  Delicious.

These are wonderful!  My college kids make these, they throw a frozen one in the book bags before they leave their apartment in the morning and then find a microwave in the food court on campus.  They only cast about 1.00 per wrap to make!  And they taste great!

These are really, really good and very fast and easy.  I make them vegan by leaving out the cheese.  I also substitute salsa for the diced tomatoes/chiles and use all black beans.  Wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla, it's great!

GREAT!  I only gave 4 stars because they are missing something. Maybe I'll use spicy rotel next time, or add some onions. Recipe needs some tweaking but is still delicious, and very convienient! The recipe made about 8 good size burritos which I froze a few of them, will see if they hold up in the freezer or not.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was that I made changes based on the other reviews.  I added taco seasoning to the rice.  I added extra tomatoes and corn.  They are GREAT for packing in a lunch...just grab it out of the freezer, then at lunch time microwave it for 2 or 3 minutes.  Also good with sour cream and salsa for dipping.

These were easy enough to make.  The flavor could benefit from the addition of some cumin or cilantro, maybe both.

this was super simple to make - i wasnt trying to make them to freeze, so i put them together and then baked them for 10 mins at 350 deg.  made the tortillas nice and crispy!  CHANGES I MADE:  i quartered the recipe and got 5 wraps out of it; but i used about half a can of corn & rotel.  i added half a pkg taco seasoning and it could've used more.  i also added a good bit of salt, pepper, & garlic powder.  next time i will up the taco seasoning and might add either chopped onion or onion powder - and possibly some tony cachere's seasoning.  when i served them, i add a bit of ranch dressing to mine and it was great!

I really enjoyed these. I did add 1/2 cup chopped red onions and I served sour cream, guacamole and salsa on the side. They are delicious as is and taste great out of the freezer too.

Quick, healthy, and very tasty lunch time option. Just make, wrap in foil individually, and put in a zip-lock bag. When you're ready to eat one, just unwrap and microwave. Perfect.

I liked that these could be made ahead and frozen.  Something quick for lunch!  I also added in some extra spices as I thought they were bland.  Instead of flour tortillas, use whole wheat tortillas to make this a healthy lunch as well. And when served, I added salsa on top to give it a little more kick.  Good and filling.

This is the first recipe I have taken the time to review (after using allrecipes.com for years.) These wraps are truly excellent!  My changes were minor---I used fresh tomatoes and a can of green chiles instead of the combination.

These are fantastic!  I substitute spinach tortillas for the flour tortillas, quinoa for the rice, and mix up the beans to include black beans and kidney.  Super great for making ahead and freezing.  I'd recommend wrapping them first in wax paper and then the foil.  When you're ready to eat, just pull off the foil and microwave it with the wax paper. This way the tortilla won't dry out and get hard.

Great recipe - check the nutritional information, I calculated it and it is actually much higher!  Calories are almost 500 - I cut back the filling a bit and brought it down.  Next time I'll use low fat or wheat tortillas.

I love these wraps!  I originally made them as a quick dinner for when I come home from work hungry at 10pm, but I like them so much that I often eat them even on my days off.

I have made these twice so far.  The first time I substituted salsa for the tomatoes and chiles and Monterey Jack cheese for Pepper-Jack.  The second time, I made no substitutions, although I did add some spices (I particularly like the flavor that garlic powder adds).  They were so much better the second time!  The Pepper-Jack really makes this recipe; don't leave it out!

Easy enough but, as written, the flavor is a bit on the bland side.  I'll add some spices next time.

I didn't exactly follow your recipe - but close to it.  I gave five stars for the idea and the comments from all the people.  I made beef ones for my husband and chicken ones for me. Through all this I learned to make "Homemade Flour Tortillas" (from this sight) to cook raw beans and  brown rice that wasn't  the"Minute" kind along with making "Taco Seasoning Mix" (from this sight also). I make homemade TV dinners for us to take to work so we don't have to eat quick unhealthy foods at the drive throughs since we work 25 miles from home. After making these I just filled up my freezer - and their healthy!! Thanks for the ideas!

I usually reduce the recipe as I make them for one and don't want them to sit for too long in the freezer. I only use the one can of black beans, and instead of the can of tomatoes just slowly add salsa until it seems the right consistency.

Very good base recipe.  I would definitely add some more spice to it next time.  I used salsa instead of tomatos w/ chilis, that was only substitution. I cut recipe in half and it still made 15 8 inch tortillas.

An awesome lunch for a busy mom.  The prep took time, but I individually wrapped them and froze them.  Then I took them to work in my lunch and microwaved at work!  A great, healthy change of pace from the typical sandwich.  Nice vegetarian alternative.  Thanks

I have been making these now for YEARS. They are a staple in our home for lunches and emergency dinners. I also give a bag to all new moms for quick, healthy meals for nursing mothers. I use salsa instead of diced tomatoes, frozen corn instead of canned. Half and half pepper jack and old cheddar. Delicious!!

I thought they needed a little more spice so next time I make them I'll probably add some seasoning- maybe taco seasoning or a little ranch dip mix. I would suggest tasting the bean & rice mix before you fill and wrap and add whatever you think it needs.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I cut the cheese in half to save on fat and price.  I've added leftover chicken when I pull them out of the freezer and top with salsa. But these provide a hearty, delicious, and economical lunch.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these in a Freezer Meals monthly cooking group and all the women in the group commented how much their families enjoyed them! They froze well and my family loved them too! So fast and easy. A few times I have added shredded chicken.

Outstanding as it is.  I have made this or a version of it more times than I can count.  I normally add about 1 lb of chicken diced.  Sometimes I top with sour cream/cream of chicken soup sauce and others mix in/top with red enchilada sauce.  Also, I've subbed Cheddar jack for my little kids that don't like the heat.  Sometimes we eat it without the shells.  Really a great recipe.

I halved this recipe, used some fresh cilatro, and increased the cheese (about 1/2 more than called for)--THESE ARE GREAT!  I had no problem with reheating the frozen ones...basically, let them sit in the fridge for a bit and then reheat them in the microwave covered with a damp papertowel.  They didn't toughen up, nor did they taste like they'd been frozen.  Serve with some salsa on the side....Totally wonderful.  Thanks for the recipes!

Very good!  I added seasoning blend, chili powder, cayenne pepper and diced jalepenos to give it some kick.  In place of the pinto beans, I used S&W flavored (Carribean or Louisianna style, etc.) beans.  I got 10 burritos sized tortilla wraps.

These are ok.  I used brown rice cooked with garlic and added a bag of frozen pepper/onion blend to the mixture.  I have a ton of them, so I'll definitely be eating them for a while.  I'll update if they get better upon my second one.

Just polished one off for lunch, and it was delish! I omitted the rice and corn, just lightly rinsed the beans (didn't want to rinse all the seasoning away) and then heated the beans in a little olive oil, adding fresh garlic and some diced onions and Balls Cajun seasoning. Added fresh cilantro, and added a little cheese to each burrito as I made them. This recipe is the bomb, and ideal for customization. Thanks for sharing... will make again and again and again. I'll never buy another pricey frozen Amy's burrito!!!

This is a great base recipe and for that I give it 4 stars.  You can really add whatever seasoning and beans you want....there's a lot of room for play. I added some garlic, chili powder, a little salt, cilantro and lime juice.  Instead of the tomato with chilis I used a little can of salsa verde. With those additions I would rate at 5 stars.  I haven't tried freezing them yet but I really hope they come out well as that would be a BIG help with lunches.  Thanks Melissa....and I'll be passing this on to my step-mother since she's vegetarian now.  (You'll never miss the meat with this recipe).

Yum!!  I substituted salsa for the tomatoes and I added some fresh cilantro (which I had on hand).  We love having these in the freezer for a quick lunch.

Thank you! The whole family very much enjoyed these, in fact devoured them in record time.  We made a few changes:  omited the canned tomatoes and corn; when heated we added sliced avacado, some homemade salsa, chopped onion and a dollop of sour cream.  This is definately on our rotating menu.

I skipped the cheese so that is diet friendly for me. Still very good. Great concept. I like having these in the freezer so as to use when I don't want to cook or if I'm running late and don't have time to pack a lunch in the mornings.

Yes, you definately need to halve this recipe.  Pretty good though. I'll have to try the taco seasoning suggestion next time.

These are pretty good, but they came out a little bland the first time I made them.  The next time around, I added about half a packet of taco seasoning to the rice as I was cooking it. I also added some fresh cilantro to the mixture.  Next time, I'm going to use a whole packet of taco seasoning for the rice.  Good with some hot sauce on top.

These wraps turned out really well, though I ended up with a LOT of extra filling. I made a few changes: I used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned, and added some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder to taste to give it a bit more flavor. I'll be making these again, they're great to take to work.

Well I thought these were excellent! Some work but hey, in the end, I just have to pop 'em in the microwave! I cooked the rice as suggested in the chicken broth, and I also added a half packett of taco seasoning.  I cooked up some chicken and used the other half of the taco seasoning in that, and mixed it all together.  I didn't have any diced tomatoes, so I mixed it all together with 1.5 cups of mild salsa.  Absolutely delicious!!  :)

I made these last night, and they are fantastic!!! Even my meat eating husband loved them. I halved the recipe just in case we didn't like them and I ended up with 12 wraps. I did make a couple changes to suit our tastes: I didn't use tomatoes and chiles (I don't like them), I used chicken broth instead of water for the rice, one can of the black beans I drained half of the liquid and simmered them so that they kind of resembled refried beans, and when I was mixing the ingredients I added alot of chile powder, garlic salt, and about 6oz of enchilada sauce. Oh and I used wheat tortillas. I didn't think the corn would be that good, but it added a good crunch. They will very convenient and healthy for lunches and late night dinners. Thank you so much!!!

I'm a pretty spastic cook and I seriously messed this recipe up, but it still came out great!  I made a lot of modifications, based on other reviews.

I added taco seasoning to the rice, but I dumped too much in... so I added more rice, a chopped tomato, a chopped onion, and some water and used my rice cooker.  It was really tasty.  

I used 1 can each of pinto & black beans, a 12 oz box of frozen corn, a little salsa, and a chopped tomato.  I seasoned it with fresh cilantro, a dash each of cumin, coriander and oregano, some lime juice, and salt and black pepper.  I roughly blended about a third of the bean mixture in the food processor, then I blended another third 'til it was pretty smooth, and left the last third alone.  Mixed together, it looked and tasted a lot like chunky refried beans.

Putting the burritos together, I put the beans on first and then the rice (instead of mixing them together).  I wrapped them in foil individually and put them in a freezer bag.  I made up two with some shredded jack cheese (on top of the rice) for that evening and heated them in the oven (15 minutes at 400 deg., with a bit of canola oil brushed on top).  They're really good heated in the oven because the tortilla gets crispy and nice.  We ate them w/ salsa & sour cream.  My boyfriend says they're "lovely."

I made a total of 14 burritos (12 on 10" tortillas and 2 on 8" tortillas), with some beans and rice left over.

I love this recipe and have made it a dozen times. If you make the full recipe it's true that you will have a lot more then 16 wraps. I think I usually end up with between 25 and 30.  I have used a lot of different combinations of spices and because the recipe is so plain to begin with, almost anything will work well with it.  I usually add chili powder, some franks hot sauce, a bit of lime juice.  I also cut down the cheese a bit or use a low fat cheese, because it's a lot of cheese! I also find that I like the whole wheat wraps with this best.

Also sometimes when I cook them, I throw some salsa over top and heat the whole thing up. Yummy.  This is a really simple and tasty recipe.

Thanks to all previous posters for the very helpful suggestions. I made this by cutting down on beans, eliminating the rice and adding diced, cooked chicken breast, added spices and ranch dressing. Used mexican blend shredded cheese. This recipe makes a TON, even when you cut it down! I wrapped these in parchment paper first and then in plastic. The parchment is great for heating them up in either the toaster oven or microwave at the office.  These are certainly better than fast food for lunch and much cheaper too! Thanks for the post :-)

These are good. I left out the corn and added fresh cilantro. Just a warning: DO NOT MICROWAVE IN THE PLASTIC WRAP...they came out of the microwave hard as a rock! They are good reheated on a plate. Surprisingly good and filling considering there is no meat. ..Thanks Melissa!

This was so fast and easy even I didn't mess it up! I used: 1 can Southwestern black beans (drained but didn't rinse), 1 can pinto beans, 1 can corn, 1 can tomatoes and chillis, 1 pouch of Success Longgrain Brown rice, Mrs Dash extra spicy, to taste. This still made LOTS! Garnish w/ sour cream. I also baked mine in the oven to melt the cheese and cook the beans. OH! And I used whole wheat tortillas too. :)

Awesome idea, and these are good both hot and cold. I left out the cheese because I was going to be taking some along on a plane ride and didn't have anywhere to refridgerate them, and it still tasted good. I can see how the cheese would have added though, and I'll probably put it in next time. I also added a little bit of dried cilantro and chili powder, but it ended up not being enough to really be noticeable, and I'll have to play with it more next time. Also, I ended up using all 16 tortillas, plus 3 more smaller tortillas. I microwave the frozen ones for 2:40, and they're great!

This is so far, my favorite recipe from this site.  I halved the recipe and used chicken broth instead of water when making the rice.  I also used colby jack cheese instead of pepperjack because it was all that I had.  These are the yummiest burritos ever.  Not to mention being healthy, easy to make, and cheap!  I thought my husband might think that they were bland, but he loved them more than I did.  He eats them with salsa, I eat them plain.  This is all that we've eaten for lunch and dinner all week long.  They re-heat very well and I highly recommend trying out this recipe.

Made these on the weekend and boy I'm a fan!  With 3 young kids, morning time can be busy and these wraps are just great for my husband to grab for his lunch.  I think next time I will add some salsa for added flavor and will use the recomended pepper jack cheese (only had cheddar on hand).  Be warned - it makes a ton!

very delicious.  I added half the amt of cheese to make it healthier.  Be prepared--this recipe made me at LEAST 30 rolls, so have lots of tortillas on hand!  Also, I live in Southern Florida, so I used the Vigo Yellow rice available down here.  Not sure if this is avaiable throughout the U.S.

you can't go wrong with these! i only used half of the suggested rice and one can each of black and pinto beans, and it was enough. also, i used plain canned diced tomatoes. next time i will not use pepper jack, but the mex cheese blend someone else suggested. i don't think this recipe needs the spice, but it could use some onion, so i'm adding a little to my rice as it cooks next time. other people said it was dry, but i didn't think so. also, the beans, tomatoes, and corn are a surprise - they're soooo good together! i added a touch of garlic salt. a fresh-tasting meal and worth experimenting with, fast and easy! it will be refreshing in the summer, too.

I'll have to use smaller tortillas next time--there wasn't enough rice mixture to go around.  It also needs some more variety and spice.  My husband suggested adding refried beans, which I'll try, and I think adding some veggies like roasted bell peppers would be good too.  I'm also going to try a batch using some burrito seasoning and see if that helps it.  

However, these are relatively easy to make, and VERY handy for those work lunches.  This is adding some variety to our meals and keeping my husband from spending money on fattening, cholesterol-high fast food. :)

These burritos are surprisingly good, and they truly make 16 that you can wrap and freeze.  I wanted to spice mine up a bit, so I added some ADOBO seasoning, some fresh cilantro, and some sauteed spinach in garlic...they came out excellent and I will definitely be making them again!!!

Hmmmm soooo good!  I've been trying to find a rice / bean burito recipe for some time. This is it! I didn't read the recipe right, so I only bought 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto beans. With the other ingredients, it was a perfect balance. Not to many beans. I used about 10 shells, ending up eating the rest out of the bowl.  I froze all of mine for my husband to just grab for his lunch.  Great taste!

These are great! I cut the recipe in half because I wasn't sure if I would like them so the proportions were a little off. I used mexican taco blend cheese and I didn't have brown rice so I used jasimine - was a little worried that the flavors wouldn't go but these wraps were delicious! I also served them warm with salsa, it adds a little more kick. Thanks Melissa!

These wraps are a perfect, quick lunch/dinner, much healthier than my other frozen go tos. I do mix the rice with taco seasoning. I had people eat them that were surprised to find out there was no meat in it at all. It was that good, that satisfying.

I made these the other day and put some in wraps and some in mini pitas (as thats what i had in fridge) and the filling alone was great to eat but also great in the shells. My husband actually eats them too. And so simple just take out of freezer and go! Thanks

I cut this recipe in half and it still made A LOT!  I used 5oz of salsa in place of the tomatoes with chiles.  I accidentally left out the cheese, but for me that's OK.  I did add 1 Tbsp each of cumin and chili powder, as well as some Italian seasoning.  It's great to have these on hand to use as needed.

Very easy to make and super delicious. I used a box seasoned Mexican rice to add some flavor to the plain corn and black beans. Omitted the pinto beans and diced tomatoes/chilies and it still tasted great. 1 can black beans, 1 can corn, and one box of Mexican rice and sprinkled cheese filled 10 smaller-sized tortillas.

Quick, easy, relatively healthy and best of all... Tasty! I made and froze, then unwrapped when ready to indulge and threw in some fresh lettuce, tomato and sour cream. Yum.

Very good and easy lunch.  It only takes about a minute in the microwave from the freezer and no quality is compromised! Recipe is a little bland but a few personal adjustments can easily be made. I had 16 tortillas and put about one cup in each (they were hard to roll up with any more than that!) and ran out of tortillas.  I think I had enough for 2 or 3 more.

Added taco seasoning and fresh cilantro. Added cheese atop individual wraps to get good coverage. Husband said, and I quote "These are amazing!"

These are a staple at my house. I do usually add more cheese than called for, but with the prescribed amount they are very good. I use all black beans and no pinto, but that is just a personal preference.

These turned out great!!  I was looking for a way to use up the last little bit of a roast turkey that didn't require me to eat turkey again so soon.  I know it's not in the recipe, but diced turkey just made it better especially with salsa and sour cream on top.  Great for a quick lunch!

Love this recipe, they don't even have to be frozen and can last all week in the fridge. My fiance always requests more corn, so I add 2 cans instead of 1. I put jalapenos and hot sauce in his and cilantro in mine. Great to bring to work!

A very good idea for quick lunches and healthy with all the protein from the beans. A great base recipe, but it definitely needs some spice so I'd recommend adding cumin, garlic, etc. and maybe use your favorite salsa in place of the canned tomatoes w/chilis. I love having these for lunch; one wrap and I'm full (thus avoiding the urge to run to the vending machine at 3pm haha). Thanks for sharing!

I gave this 4 stars based on the fact that I also made a few changes after reading reviews.  I sauteed an onion in olive olive and then added the rice and used chicken broth to cook.  I like the flavor that the broth adds.  After the rice was cooked I added taco seasoning to it.  The rest of the recipe I followed.  I cut the recipe in half and I did get 10 wraps and they are very generous sized.  Now it's a 5 star recipe.  Yum!  Who says that you can only eat them for lunch?  Made a great dinner the first day and the rest went in the freezer for lunches.

Its good but its missing flavor in the the burrito. I'll play with it and find what it needs.For me it makes a HUGE AMOUNT (I get 20 wraps out of it.) Update: 06/23/2019  I make the rice with 1 Tablespoon Of chicken boullion, 1tsp. Of garlic and 1 Tablespoon of onion powder. 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of tomato paste. 2 cans of kidney beans, 2 cans of corn mix it up and put 1 cup of the mix in a tortilla then roll up in a burrito. I put 2 burritos in a quart size bag ,freeze until ready to eat.

THESE WRAPS ARE EXCELLENT.  I MAKE A LARGE BATCH WRAP THEM IN TIGHTLY PLASTIC  WRAP AND THEN ALUMINUM FOIL AND THEM FREEZE THEM IN A LARGE FREEZER BAG, THEN MICROWAVE THEM AS NEEDED FOR ABOUT 1 MINUTE.  I HAVE MADE THEM WITH BOTH FLOUR AND CORN TORTILLAS. THE FLOUR TORTILLAS ROLL EASIER HOWEVER, THE CORN TASTES BETTER

We really love these.  I'll usually make a large batch of them to freeze for future lunches.  I will mix up the ingredients sometimes too - adding shredded chicken, etc.  They are great for a quick snack or lunch.

So Good! And a HUGE time saver.  Sometimes I add jalapenos for a little extra kick.  My guy is a soldier, so sometimes when he is on mission and I'm all alone these are the perfect solution to my, "I don't feel like cooking just for me" nights!  Thanks for sharing.

This made big lunch wraps.  It was a nice flavor kick at lunch with the pepperjack cheese and bean combo.  I want to try this with a mexi-cheese combo next time.  That's why I only gave it 4 stars.  

Loved how I could take the out of freezer and just heat at lunch and they were perfect.  

I will keep this recipe in my box.

We absolutely love these, and I get asked for the recipe on a regular basis. I'm a terrible cook, but my friends now jokingly refer to these as my world famous burritos :) We prepare them in bulk and freeze a portion for busy lunches. You won't be disappointed! I add squeeze cilantro to our mix.

These are delicious!  I made them with both white and whole wheat wraps.  In the bean mixture I added taco seasoning and chopped jalapenos.  To freeze I wrapped them in saran and then foil.  I then labelled them with the date with a sharpie.  I didn't think they would - but they tasted better after they had been frozen.  Great idea!  Thanks!

I've made these time & time again.  I've made them with cheddar or provolone cheese (my fav.), I've made them with or without corn, with chipolte chili's, with refried beans.  Pretty much if you have the tortilla's you can make some version of these wraps.  Make and wrap them on a sheet of parchment paper then wrap in foil - stick all in a freezer bag & take one out on your way to work & by lunch just nuke for 2 minutes.  They are filling & good.  Just make sure you you leave enough time to make them & drain everything well.  These are good to make/have in the freezer when grocery money is tight.  Thank you!

I made this recipe as the instructions directed but as other members have mentioned, it was not as tasty as it could have been.  It was easy to make and even easier to freeze and use in lunches (which I love) but I will try to add some more spices or maybe some sauce next time I make it to give a flavor boost.

These truly are great Make Ahead Lunch Wraps.  But they make a huge portion.  I used the exact proportions of each ingredient but scaled the recipe for four servings.  Then, using 16 eight-inch flour tortillas, I made up all the wraps, wrapped them in plastic wrap and froze them.  Much better portions with all the same great taste.

This is so easy to make, and taste great. I also like the mixture on top of some whole grain nachos with sour cream and salsa. Good healthy lunch!

I'm shocked at how perfect this was.  Even my picky 11 year old loves to eat this filling for dinner (no wrap for her, she's gluten free).  I just freeze the entire batch in individual sandwich-sized ziplocks and dump a serving into a bowl to heat and serve.  Super fast meals for dinner, and I take a to-go frozen bag to work for my lunches.  The pre-seasoned diced tomatoes are just the perfect amount of seasoning.  Super awesome recipe!

so good- I used mexi shredded cheese, as I did not have any pepper jack on hand- I also used jalepeno flavored tortilla wraps and added 2 small shredded chicken breast to the mix before freezing. Can't wait to put this in my rotation of lunches. This recipie yields many more wraps than indicated- so buy extra tortillas.

This is delicious. I had these for weeks! I will never buy those pre-packaged burritos again when I can make this much for a much lower price. Eat with salsa and you have a perfect meal.

I love having these in the freezer. They are a bit bland, so I sometimes spice things up a bit with hot salsa. The last time I made these I had more filling than tortillas, so I just froze the filling in individual servings. I either thaw & warm them and then place in a tortilla, or add to chopped lettuce along with broken tortilla chips, salsa, and ranch dressing for a quick taco salad for 1!

Easy, yummy, and so convenient to freeze individually and take to work and microwave. One recipe goes a long way. I added a 7 oz can of ortega chilis. A little spicy so I top with sour cream.

So simple, so delicious. I make a big batch and keep them in the office freezer for days when I'm too busy to make lunch. The only extra thing I add is onions, but I think I will try another reviewer's suggestion of shredded chicken too.

I made these last weekend (cut recipe in half and made 8 large burittos).  I had some left over taco meat so I threw that in as well.  I did use the whole can of Rotel tomatoes to 1/2 of the other ingredients.  I froze them individually in plastic wrap and then put in a zip lock bag.  I let one thaw overnight in the fridge and then nuked it at work for 2 minutes and it was soooo yummy.  I'm glad I found this recipe for the days I don't have leftovers to take to work.  Thank you Melissa!

Wow. I used 1 can of black beans, a can of kidney beans, the rice, corn, and tomatoes with chiles. Also added some shredded chicken and colby jack cheese. Phenomenal as a frozen entree heated for lunch!

Just finished making this recipe for the first time.  My husband and I just had it for dinner and we both LOVED it!  We did make a few adjustments to the recipe by adding salt, pepper,  and egg wash around the edge of tortilla for easier grilling (which is not called for in the original recipe).  Fun and simple to make.  Would highly recommend for quick lunches!  Start to finish ONLY took 40 minutes which included grilling and wrapping in aluminum foil.

I'll give it two stars just for the "make ahead" idea. I recommend just winging it and making your own variation.

Makes a ton of wraps!  Used 1/3 less cheese.  Have been heating up in toaster oven and pouring salsa over the top.  Easy meal on the go.  Will probably tinker with filling (adding more veggies possibly) when I make it again.

These were awesome!  I took the idea from another reviewer to add onion and red pepper and since I didn't have pinto beans I left them out.  Honestly I liked this better just eaten out of a bowl as I did for lunch right after making it but the rest went into wraps and that does make it very convenient to take to work.  Thank you for a delicious and healthy recipe!

These are nice and convenient for a quick lunch.  If you have time, instead of heating in the microwave try heating it in a skillet until the tortilla is light brown and crispy and serve with sour cream and salsa.  Very good!

I really like the idea of having these in the freezer to grab for a quick lunch or dinner.  I followed other user's suggestions and added some sauteed onions and peppers to which I added some cumin, chili powder, and paprika.  I cut back on the amount of beans by two cans.  The mixture was enough to make 20 wraps.  I liked them even better from the freezer than I did when I made the fresh.

I had class from 2:30 to 10:00 pm a few nights a week and had to think of something to bring with me that I didnt need to make every day. THESE WERE FANTASTIC! I made about 30 or more of these and chucked them in the freezer. I put them in my lunch box and then reheated them when I had a break. DELICIOUS every time!

These were pretty darn good.  I added green onion to the mix.  Next time I will leave out the corn because I didn't like the sweet note the corn gave these wraps.  Definitely keeping this recipe though!

This is an excellent recipe that you can add/delete ingredients based on what you have in your cupboards. I added shredded chicken from my leftover roast from costco. I've used different types of cheese.

I'm a nursing student and having these to pop in the micrwave for a quick healthy meal is WONDERFUL! I have even made breakfast burritos (eggs, cheese and veggie sausage) for clinical mornings when I have to be on site at 5:30 in the morning. There are so many ways to fill these for variety I'm hooked! Thanks for the great idea.

This was wonderful!  I ate just the insides for lunch at work while my fiance ate the wraps with sour cream! We did add cilantro and some cut up chicken and 1/2 the recipe because it makes so much!

Yummy.  I just made it for a study group of 5 and they were devoured in like 5 minutes.  Added the taco seasoning and instead of making the rice with water I added 4 cups of beef broth instead (using white rice not brown). Threw in some jalapenos and they were good to go.  Just threw the pot down in the middle of the table, warmed up some tortillas and it was gone in no time.  Thanks!  Will make again.

This was a great recipe with one exception: way too much rice for my liking. I would cut it at least in half. Otherwise, great stuff! I froze a batch and put one in my bag on my way out the door and by the time lunch came around, it was still cold but thawed enough to be put in the microwave for just a few minutes. A perfect lunch for students or others on the go.

Each time I make these, I put different spices/ingredients in it to mix it up a little. My favorite were the sauted onions, red peppers and jalepenos. I mixed up a batch and took them to the beach with us. People could grab one and heat it up when they were hungry. I always have a batch in the freezer to have on hand and they're healthier than pizza rolls or Hot Pockets.

This is a great base recipe.  I like it because you can "freestyle" with whatever ingredients you have on hand.  Today I had fresh sweet corn which I cut off the cob.  I followed the front page review and caramelized the onions in sugar.  The lime and sugar combination is just the right balance for cumin and oregano.  I didn't have any bell pepper on hand so I just used this really fresh salsa I picked up in my grocer's produce section.  It had diced onions, peppers, cucumber, garlic, lime, etc.  I browned some ground turkey burger patties with taco seasoning and drained a can of pinto beans.  I mixed everything together with brown basmati rice cooked with a cilantro cube and some taco seasoning.  Lastly I added some shredded cheese to the mix and rolled it with some lettuce in a tortilla.  WHAT A TASTY FREESTYLE!  Most importantly -- My children gobbled it up.  The recipe was just the inspiration I needed.  Thanks!

Excellent! I haven't eaten the wrap itself yet but I had leftover rice/bean mix and I ate that today and could almost lick the plate. I didn't measure the cheese. I didn't have pepperjack so I just used what was on hand but I'm sure it will be better next time with the pepperjack. Use the biggest tortillas you can find because the med ones are hard to fold over. Yummy.

This is a great easy recipe for a healthy lunch. The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly..the second time I omitted the rice (to heavy!) and pinto beans, used fresh salsa, cilantro, chili powder, and diced chiles....much better! Definitely defrost before re-heating. I also make a few big ones to throw in the oven  to make a quick and easy enchilada dinner later in the week!

Awesome recipe!  Even my meat-lover husband loves these!  We a batch on Sundays and bring them to work for lunches.

It is great the way it is, but we usually throw in another can of diced tomatoes, black olives and whatever hot peppers we have on hand.

These were good until frozen they didn't re-heat very well. If you just make them and eat them they are great. Just don't freeze a bunch....they don't taste good later

Cheap, healthy and so convenient to keep in the freezer!  I halved the recipe and got 10 wraps.  Skipped the pinto beans due to personal preference and used a full can of corn and tomatoes.  I think I might increase the cheese a bit, even though that would up the fat content.  Great recipe idea, thanks!

Mmm - tasty combo of rice, beans, tomatoes and corn! I didn't like the addition of the brown rice - too time consuming an it made the wrap too bland and carb-heavy. So, for the rest of my wraps I used whole wheat pitas and omitted the brown rice.  I didn't have green chilis or pepperjack cheese so I used mozzarella and added chili powder, garlic salt and cayenne for flavour - but I'm sure it would be awesome as written.  I recommend leaving out the rice and trading for a whole wheat pita to save calories and a heck of a lot of time! Otherwise, awesome recipe.

I dropped these off for my husband last night, and before I'd even left the parking lot received a text:  "These are delicious!"  This morning I asked if he wanted me to make them again some time.  "Yes!" he exclaimed- "Today!"  I pointed out that there are seven in the freezer, but it didn't change his request.  I can't eat them myself (no dairy or wheat), but I consider this a success, especially as fed to a meat-loving man.  ***A half recipe made 8 LARGE burritos, with some left over.  (Next time I'll make 8 extra large or 10 regular-sized burritos.***  ***I used a whole packet of taco seasoning in a half recipe (1 c uncooked rice).  Definite requirement for flavor. I also highly recommend salsa in place of tomatoes.*** ***I used a package of whole wheat tortillas, and then a white flour tortilla (i.e., all the tortillas I had).  The whole wheat is infinitely more nutritious but, because it lacks gluten, didn't have the elasticity to wrap quite as well.***

This was a really good change of pace from the normal mayo and lunch meat sandwich.  I seasoned the rice with Fajita seasoning(homemade) and used salsa (medium heat) instead of the tomatoes and I used 2 cans of black beans, 1 can of pinto beans, and 1 bag of southwest veggie mix (corn, beans, onions, peppers).  I used colby jack cheese and home made tortillas.  Came out great!  Storing some in the freezer so my hubby can have some lunch when I finally have this baby.  I used 2/3 c. of filling per tortilla.  I probally have between 6-8 inch tortillas.

My husband and I LOVE these!  They are perfect for when a sandwich just won't cut it.  As others stated, I added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to rice before mixing in beans.  I also find they microwave better if they are defrosted first.  This isn't required, but it seems to work better if you have the extra time.

These wraps are terrific! I also added taco seasoning to the rice. I've made them a couple different ways(without the tomatoes or without the chilis) and they come out great every time. The whole family loves them. They freeze well too. Thanks for such a great recipe!

My wife and I most certainly enjoyed these wraps.  To spice the wrap up a bit, I added some diced jalapenos and some spicy taco ranch dressing from Ortega.

These were pretty bland so I added chili powder and cilantro for more flavor. These are perfect for someone with a busy schedule. I will really find out just how much I like these when I get half way through the 20 that I made!

Loved them! Makes for a quick, healthy lunch especially for the kids. Followed others suggestions: cut rice in 1/2, used chicken broth rather than water, and added taco seasoning mix while cooking rice.

I wasn't very impressed with the flavor of these wraps.  I used chicken broth to cook the rice in but didn't have a packet of taco seasoning like the other reviewers recommended...  So it tasted very beany and bland.  I also cut the recipe in half and it made 24 wraps with 8 inch tortillas, and I even had some more filling left over.  I'm glad I didn't make the full recipe.  I don't think I'll try making it again unless I discover some more drastically flavorful substitutions or additions.

This is really easy to make and it tastes great days after it is made.  I used a bag of corn with yellow and red peppers in it just to add some more crunch.  I also only used 1 cup of rice.

These are soo yummy!!  I am eatting one right now.  It definatly has a bite to it.  I did add a little taco seasoning to the veggies and I added more corn and took out the pinto beans but other then that it was exact.  It made a TON.  I even cut it in half.

Wonderful.  I used whole wheat tortillas and fresh tomatoes. Also 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to brown rice. Easy to make.  Recipe made about 14.  We ate them more like burritos though.  I have already been asked to make these again.

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of a few things I got from other reviews.  I cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water and added a packet of taco seasoning at the beginning.  Rice turned out delicious. I also added a can of green chiles in addition to the can of rotel.  I used the 10 inch tortillas and it made exactly 24 (using 1 cup of filling for each). 

I wrapped up 20 of them in parchment paper and then foil and put them in the freezer.  With the other 4 I brushed a bit of olive oil on both sides and put them in the oven for about 25 minutes on 350, turning them over 1/2 way through.  They came out nice and browned.  I was a little worried because my boyfriend is a big meat eater but these were a success and he went back for more!  Delicious recipe!

Excellent. Not sure why some people think it doesn't have flavor. My guess is that they are not using the pepper jack cheese. (I used the full pound - delicious.) I skipped one can of black beans and all the pintos (don't like them.) I accidentally bought the spicy rotel, so that might have given it extra kick. It was really fabulous, and I look forward to having it over the next few days (I don't think they'll last long.) Only thing I might do is add extra corn.

I thought that these were good, but I got sick of them before my boyfriend and I were able to eat them all. The recipe is a little large for just two people - next time i'll cut the recipe in half.

Very good and very convenient.  I added a package of taco seasoning to the rice.  Also, I had to make some substitutions as can sizes are different here in Canada -- I used three 19oz cans of black beans, two 19oz cans of romano beans (I couldn't find pinto), one 19oz can of mini-diced tomatoes, a couple TB of chopped pickled jalepeno and a 12 oz can of corn.  I also cut the cheese amount by half to save fat/money.  I used 1 cup of filling per wrap and got a total of 18.  Taste best when dipped in something like salsa.

Delicious. I threw in a deli chicken cooked in taco seasoning and substituted refried beans for the pinto beans. These were really, really good. I also halved the recipe and we made 6 burritos for dinner and have lots leftover for next weeks lunch. A definite keeper.

I knew this recipe was a success when my teen boys told me they'd finished the batch I made the previous week and asked me to make more!  What a great school (and home) lunch!!!  With previous reviews in mind, I used only one can of each kind of bean and one cup of rice.  I also added chipotle powder, cumin, ground coriander, garlic powder, salt and freshly ground pepper.  I still had leftovers after I filled 20 tortillas!!  My family loves microwaving the tortillas for 1 minute, and then dipping them in salsa.  I've also shared the recipe (and my suggestions) with other moms, who tell me their children of all ages also can't get enough of these.

My grandchildren love this recipe. IT CAUSES THEM TO VISIT ME MORE!! They know I have them in the freezer.  I use the big tortilla (burrito style) for big grandchildren and I use the small tortilla (quesadilla style), topped with cheese and salsa, cut like a pizza, for small grandchildren.
Quick, easy, and a big hit.

These are really tasty! Also very easy to prepare.  Here are the changes I made...added some cooked shredded chicken, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, & garlic.  I used 8 inch tortilla wraps and the recipe yieled 34 wraps in all.  We love them dipped in salsa.  Next time I might add a little more cheese.  Will make again as soon our freezer stash runs out!

I really like these ~ I followed the directions exactly and they are so convenient to have for my lunch at work. I take one out of the freezer and put it in the fridge the night before I am going to have it. Then it only takes 30 seconds in the microwave at work the next day. I think the cheese really makes these wraps!!!  Very worth the effort.

Made these ahead of time, added a little more cliantro.  Thinking next may use soy ground beef.
They are yummy, and nice to have on hand.
Thanks for a great recipe!

These were wonderful! Instead of brown rice I used meixcan rice. It gave them alot of flavor. They were spicy enough for us! They do yield a ton so be prepared.

We loved this one. However, I got way more than 16 wraps out of it. For a little extra spice, add some salsa after reheating. Great recipe!  =)

These freeze really well and are great for lunch at the office for someone looking for a healthy alternative to the sodium-filled frozen dinners.  I halved the recipe and produced 11 wraps.  And don't be skimpy with the cheese - it's what holds these guys together - yum!

Very good idea - I bring them to work for lunch.  Much better than my typical frozen dinner.  Recipe makes SOOOOOOOO many.  Next time I will add spicy salsa instead of the tomatoes or add peppers for some heat.

FABULOUS!  I added some shredded cheddar jack and halved the recipe - it still makes a TON.  I browned the wraps in a bit of olive oil to get the cheese melted and served with a dollop of light sour cream.  These will become a favorite in my house.

These were great.  I halved the recipe and used refried beans instead of pinto beans.  It made about 12 large wraps. I mixed the refried beans with burrito seasoning before combining with other ingredients.  Since many said these needed some spicing up, I also added some sliced jalapenos, which made it quite spicy.  So spicy, in fact, I had to pick a few out.  I like spice, but that was a little too much with the spice from the cheese, the tomatoes with chilis, and the burrito seasoning.  I also used instant brown rice, which worked just as well as regular rice.  I will definitely make these again!

I would give this 10 out of 5 stars if I could.
We ate a couple the night I made them (note - still microwave them for a couple of minutes and they taste better the night you make them) and I wrapped 10 in the freezer.  Take them out, microwave them for about 3 minutes, and you have a healthy snack or lunch.  Pleased the whole family - even my 6 year old liked them after I made her take a bite!

These are quick and easy to make. I halved the recipe but used a 9 oz. can of corn and 14 oz can of tomatoes. My teen daughter loved them as is. I felt they needed some spicing up. So you will need to be a judge of that yourself. If you like bland dishes, leave as is. If you like spices, make sure to add some. Next time I will use salsa instead of tomatoes. I also found the recipe filled way more tortillas than it says. Buy an extra package for yourself. This is a great vegetarian meal. I like having them on hand, for days I don't feel like cooking two meals. My husband is a fervent meat lover.

Good and easy and cheap!  But needed some spicing up...I added fresh salsa, garlic salt, diced red onion, pepper, and cilantro to the mix, and served with sour cream and salsa.  I halved the recipie and still made more than enough for 6 full wraps.  I used brown rice instead of white and garlic herb wraps instead of plain flour tortillas.  Just froze them last night so can't wait to see how they turn out! (We ate 2 fresh!)

This recipe is excellent and works great for my busy schedule. It does make a HUGE mixture, though, and next time I will make less rice and add less beans and cheese. I think it could use more tomatoes and a little more flavor. I will add dried cumin, cilantro, and garlic powder next time.

AMAZING!  This is the best homemade burrito I have ever had!  I love that it was sooooo easy to make and that I can freeze it and heat it when I want to!  I wish all of the recipes were this easy and yummy!

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that I thought it could use a little more zip; I added a little cayenne.  I made a few changes to the basic recipe.  I reduced the rice to 1 cup (to which I added a little garlic powder when it was cooked) and the black and pinto beans to 1 can each.  I substituted shredded Mexican 4 cheese for the pepper jack cheese and used whole wheat tortillas.  Anyway, I froze them in aluminum foil & just took the aluminum foil off before microwaving it on a paper plate at work.  I brought a couple small containers with light sour cream and medium salsa which I added after heating them up.  YUM.  It was a little messy so I ate some using a knife & fork & picked up a few pieces too.  Just FYI, I've read that it's a "no-no" to microwave with plastic wrap as it can melt into the food!!!!!

I was actually surprised at how delicious these are.  It's nice having lunch in the freezer - grab one and go.  I think I may try adding a bit of salsa next time, for a little zip, but it really is fine as is.  I found when portioning it out one cup per tortilla was about perfect.  We also used whole wheat tortillas, which makes it that much more healthy.

So convenient! I like to sprinkle the shredded cheese on the outside before I toss them in the microwave, and serve with lots of salsa. Needed a bit of spicing up, but Tabasco always takes care of that for me. Thanks, Melissa - a healthy grab & go lunch recipe was exactly what we needed!

These were good, but in my opinion they could have used a tad more flavor (cumin or chili powder maybe).  I didn't make the full amount since I was the only one eating it.  I didn't add the corn because I didn't have any and I used shredded mexican blend cheese rather than the pepper jack.  I served this with picante sauce and it made a great lunch.

Very good.  This is an excellent idea for lunch or a quick snack.  The recipe made a ton, and I ran out of tortillas so I ended up wasting the leftover mixture.  The next time I put this together, I'm going to halve the amount of rice and beans keeping the corn and cheese ratio the same.

My husband and I liked this recipe, but my picker eater would not touch it! I thought it had a nice flavor, but a bit on the spicy side. Only thing I would change, would be less rice, as I thought it was to dry! Will be a good appetizer too!!

The whole family enjoyed this (and wanted seconds) from ages 3-30.  I might have used the wrong size tortilla...we needed 24 tortillas instead of 16.  I also used those really simple alum. foil pop up wrapper sheets to quickly individually wrap the wraps (my daughter was then able to help with that part).  Possibly a TAD dry, but again, everyone liked it.

I made 1/4 of this recipe for 6 huge burritos, but I did add some cilantro salsa, 1/3 pack of taco seasoning, and more pinto beans than the recipe called for. They're excellent heated up in the microwave.

Made these yesterday, halved the recipe and it still made a ton! I froze them all, I think there were 12 all together. I cut the burrito wraps in half also. Microwaved one today on high for 1.5 minutes and served with sour cream. Really good! Recipe seems very adaptable, I think I’ll be using this one a lot. Thanks!

My girlfriend likes to make freezable recipes (less fuss when you're feeling lazy after work), and this lunch wrap fits the bill perfectly. The recipe makes SO MUCH filling, so be prepared to use more tortillas than it suggests.

The only change we made for our second go-around was the type of cheese. It's strangely difficult to find pepper jack at Jewel (at least at the one near us), so we had to improvise with a Monterrey Jack, jalapeno, and cheddar blend. The consistency changed slightly (thanks, cheddar), but the flavor was still good.

I recommend a medium to hot salsa to bring out more flavor here, but that's a matter of preference.

Great base recipe! I used quinoa like one other reviewer did, just to make it more interesting. I also added cumin and chili powder to the quinoa. I used cheddar cheese (what I had) and I made 16 huge burritos with filling to spare, which I heated up and put sour cream and salsa on and the family ate it for lunch. I also added onions and green pepper to that mix. Tons of lunches and not much work, I love it! I will make this again and again, changing up the ingredients so we don't get sick of them. They taste nice and fresh, and are so cheap to make!

I made and froze these for the summer so my kids could grab and go. They LOVE them and so do I. I will make them for school lunches in the fall. The only change I made was on accident. I added only one can of pinto (grabbed a refried on the pinto shelf :/), and they were still amazing! They reheat very well. We do 2 minutes on 50% power, but microwaves vary.

These wraps make a tasty and healthy lunch or snack. I added a chopped onion and a chopped tomato, and I quickly sautéed the onion and chile in a lttle olive oil.

I used a lot of Kroger brand items ( fiesta style corn, Kroger black beans, Kroger pinto beans, pepper jack) and rotel ( also salted my rice) and it still turned out amazing! I'm very excited be having these for lunch for the next couple days. My omnivore boyfriend even requested a few and wants me to make him his own batch (with meat of course). Thanks for sharing!!

This was perfect! I am not a vegetarian but I did this for a light lunch and its so easy and handy. I added cilantro and a little lime juice and left out the rice to reduce the carbs. I have a small household and it's nice to freeze these so we can just grab and go with our busy schedules!

These are pretty good and I'm sure I'll make again. I omitted the tomatoes, because I didn't have any on hand, and I added a small can of green chilies. I did salt and pepper everything, and don't think I used quite a cup of cheese, which was a shredded Mexican blend. I'm definitely going to experiment with flavors, and try quinoa as well. And I did use 10" whole wheat tortillas too. We ate most fresh from assembling and baking for 10 mins, but I froze some to see how they reheat. Haven't got there yet, but they probably will be good. :) Thanks for a great recipe!

These were really good!  I added some shredded chicken as my husband refuses to eat something with no meat in it.

The only other change I made was I added one can of kidney beans and an extra can of corn as I did not have pinto beans.

I think this recipe is really great on it's own, but it's also a fantastic starting place for more complicated recipes.

Easy, creative, and funtional for those lazy late night cravings. I love the idea so much that I think I'll start another batch before I even have the first batch used up. This aren't anywhere close to those nasty, soggy store bought burritos. If you want the tortillas to have that golden brown crispness, heat a skillet on medium heat, cook a min on each side. I rolled these as my tortillas were still warm & found it made rolling them easier. Shared this idea. Thanks for sharing:)

Great and easy make ahead recipe. I added salsa, chopped olives and some additional spices. (Cayenne and cumin). Made a half recipe—perfect for 10 tortillas. Freeze, reheat, and enjoy!

My husband gets tired of sandwiches so I thought I'd add some variety to his lunches with these wraps. As written, I'd give them 4 stars. They're really pretty bland without salsa or extra spices. Great inspirational springboard though, and will make an easy end of leftovers (chopped peppers, squash, shredded chicken, etc.). Will make again with some added heat.

It adds a lot of extra flavor to cook your rice in vegetable or chicken stock. I then added fresh cilantro, and chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, and onion powder to the rice after it cooked. I also added extra corn (frozen) since I didn't have the pinto beans. It made 18 wraps (1/2 c. filling per 10" burrito size tortillas). I am  anxious to take these to work! The filling tastes awesome! Update: These were AWESOME to freeze and take to work- just set out to thaw in the morning to microwave at lunch for a few minutes- they are SO YUMMY- especially with some picante sauce and sour cream on top! Much Healthier and Much cheaper than buying lunch out! I am getting ready to go back to school- I  am a teacher- and am planning on making a double or triple recipe to freeze and take for lunch- they are THAT good! I also plan to exchange Red Heirloom Quinoa for the brown rice- I hope it's good, too! Update 3- yes half quinoa and half brown rice was exceptional! This recipe is my absolute favorite lunch!! I'd give this recipe way more than 5 stars if I could.....it is very healthy, cheap, very tasty and filling! Love it!

Wonderful recipe but I thought it would be bland so I added a Poblano and Jalepeno pepper and a pound of ground beef cooked in taco spices,  It could have used more hot pepper.  My husband raved about the wrap he had for lunch.  You need a HUGE bowl.  I had to split my recipe into thirds to get it into the bowls I have for mixing.

As usual, I don’t tend to follow recipes exactly, but I tried this one out because I was getting bored with my lunch and I’ve been trying to cut down on my meat intake.  This was a grand idea!  I loved her recommendation to rinse the beans! It helped make the burrito less messy and it gets rid of some of the salt they can it with.  

My modifications: I accidentally forgot the rice because I’m a dork, but I know that will be great and I’ll try not to forget it next time. I'll cook it in some broth and lime juice.  I sautéed all the veggies along with onions and two types of chilies until the onions were nice and caramelized.  I added seasoning and lime juice.  I kept that separate from the black beans that I used.  

To transport to work I just put beans on one side of my bento box, the veggies on the other, and I sprinkled the cheese all over the top.  I wrapped up a tortilla in foil and once I’m at work I can microwave the filling until the cheese melts and I have a delicious vegetarian lunch!  When I remember, I also bring along a bottle of hot sauce and it adds a nice kick.  And the great part is I don’t even need to freeze it if I finish it off by the end of the week.  I just keep it in the fridge and spoon into my lunch box the night before so it’s ready to grab and go!  Thanks for the great idea!  This has a ton of modification possibilities to keep my lunch exciting!

These were OK. Adding the taco seasoning and cilantro helped, and I would try again with chicken. Probably would have been better with salsa and sour cream on the side, but dragging all of that to work can be a chore. I guess I'm just not meant to bring lunch from home. *shrug*

I've really enjoyed this recipe. Changes we made were we added a packet of taco seasoning, I used a can of Mexican corn with peppers instead of regular corn, a small can spicy pickled carrots, and fresh cilantro. It made about 25 wraps. I put a handful in the fridge and have been having them for lunch this week!!!

Cook the rice with taco seasoning. Mix one can black beans, one can pinto, one can salsa and one can corn, drain all except salsa. Add 2 C rice and one C shredded sharp cheddar. Layout 10 tortillas and divide mixture amound them. Place extra cheese and some jalapenos on each one. Roll and double wrap before freezing. Wow.

I just love the idea of this. You could make these with any combination of ingredients that appeals to you and always have a great, healthy, and filling lunch or snack on hand in the freezer. The other night I bought a grocery store rotisserie chicken and made rice and beans as just a regular weeknight dinner. I took all the leftovers, wrapped them up in tortillas, then wrapped those in aluminum foil lined with a paper towel, stuck them in a labeled freezer bag with the date, and put them in the freezer. If I know I don't have anything to take for lunch I put one in the fridge at night and the next day they are good to go. I bring it to work, remove the foil, and microwave them in the paper towel. You could put whatever kinds of leftovers you have practically. The hardest part is not overfilling your wrap and perfecting the wrapping technique. I also put my scrambled eggs in a wrap a lot, but I don't freeze those! ;)

i halved the recipe and added cilantro and a little garlic salt.  the cheese i used was 3 pepper cheese and i used corn with red and green peppers in it.  i used whole wheat tortillas.  oh, and i also added half a packet of taco seasoning to the rice.  i guess i changed a few things, but that being said, this is an awesome recipe.  i am actually craving it considering its pretty healthy!  definitely try this one!  thanks for the recipe.

A solid 4 stars for the convenience of making a big batch and freezing as a single serving lunch! A little bland for my taste, next time I will substitute two of the cans of black beans for chili beans, and use Rotel tomatoes. A couple cans of green chiles would go well too.

These are so good and so easy and they do freeze well.  I sometimes use rotel instead of tomatoes, but it is fantastic either way.

I had left over white rice, black beans and corn and chopped green chiles from different recipes so I used them to make these. I left out the pinto beans and used some chopped fresh tomato. I just mixed everything together. Used sliced pep. jack cheese and whole wheat flour tortillas. I wrapped them in plastic and warmed them up in the microwave the next day at work. I made two for my boyfried and he liked them.

I had to substitute (only due to what I had on hand) and add a few more spices (the flavor was good but, for us, needed "more") but, overall this is a very good recipe.  I scaled it to make 4 burritos and used 1/2 of the black beans and double the amount of what was called for the pinto beans using refried beans instead. I added cilatro paste & cumin to the rice, and also included chopped onions and black olives to the mixture.  Then I made them into burritos and put them in a pan and poured a can of green chili enchilada sauce over them then topped that with another 1/2 cup of cheddar and baked it about 30 minutes at 350F (or until the cheese was bubbly).  It was great.  I will, absolutely, make this recipe again and thank you for posting it!

This recipe is amazing!  Easy to make, and great warmed up!  My husband keeps asking me to make more, and he usually doesn't like beans.  I tried topping it with salsa, ranch dressing, tabasco sauce, and hummus to create some variety, and all were really great!

seriously easy and SERIOUSLY delicious!! I did use a bunch of the suggestions and cooked up some onions and red peppers, used salsa instead of the diced tomatoes & chiles, and added taco seasoning (low sodium) to the rice when it was done! I also used less cheese...this was great the night I made it but even BETTER the past few days for lunch!! thanks!!!

This is a GREAT meal I omitted the tomatoes and went with salsa as well as the taco seasoning and cumin and oregano added to the rice.  I also added the cilantro as well.  This made 15 wraps using the size of tortillas that was in the recipe.  I will keep this recipe and make this a lot as I make meals ahead for my husband to take to work.  Also use the cheese that is in the recipe it adds the kick it needs.

This is a great base recipe, but aside from the cheese - there's very little flavor to these.  I cooked white onion and a couple cloves of garlic with the corn and tomatoes.  I added some cumin, chili powder and salt.  Once the onions cooked down, I added the beans. Covered and let everything marry together.  After simmering together for about 15 minutes, I added the rice and filled the tortilla shells with the mixture.  I live by myself and I think these will be a great help in finding something healthy to eat quickly.  Thanks!

These were good, but I just couldn't put my finger on why I wasn't completely satisfied. I didn't feel like there was much favor, besides the kick of heat this recipe had. It's okay as written, but would add some different things if I were to make it again.

Good idea! You can change this up in so many ways. I thought it was a little bland as is and added cumin, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. I like knowing I have quick and healthy burritos in my freezer!

This was fantastic! You definitely need the pepper jack cheese to give it the spice. This is a recipe that is going to stick around. Though next time I may add more cheese or some hot sauce. Either way it is really really good. An easy lunch for work.

I added some chopped cilantro and red onion to this recipe and served it with sour cream on top. Freezes well.

I was really excited to try this recipe and I think it would have comeout better if I had followed the recipe. I wanted all my ingredients to be warm-so I cooked it together. We ate it and I brought it to a lunch gathering the next day. In short I would definately try this recipe again-just don't cook all the ingredients.

I think it would've been bland had I not added so much hot sauce.  Shredded chicken would go well with this.

Just made this for dinner tonight and we really liked them. I halved the recipe and it still made 10 wraps so I froze the leftovers. Added some salsa and cilantro to the bean mixture and took the advice of others and seasoned the rice with taco seasoning. My husband thought they could use a little more salsa and cheese, but also said they tasted just like what he gets at Chipolte. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe for a healthy, quick meal. Like other reviewers I tweaked it a bit- I first cooked some onion to add some flavor and threw in cumin as well. They are never exactly the same each time I make them. I throw in all sorts of things and different amounts of each-based on what's on hand- and they always come out great. Often times I get more than 8 wraps and they freeze great.

I halved the recipe and it made 11 wraps. They were bland in my opinion. With some modifications, it could be could. If I try something like this again I would use some sort of seasoned rice, sub salsa for the tomatoes, possibly omit the corn, and definately add some fresh cilantro.

This is what I was looking for. An inexpensive lunch high in fiber. So versatile too. I added green, red and yellow peppers. Also added chili pdr, cumin, onion pdr and garlic pdr. I like my food spicy so I also added some Tabasco. I cut the recipe in half and it made 10 wraps. So good!

Pretty good base recipe- I think it's a little bland, but you can make it work. I needed more tortillas though- I actually got about 28 out of this recipe, and I even cut the black beans down to two cans! Great to have in the freezer- my husband takes these to work almost every day!

Sorry, but I just don't get the appeal.  I thought they were boring and dry, even with the cheese, which is what I assumed would "make these."  They were also messy to eat because they just fall apart.  I couldn't even easily eat them when trying to cut them into pieces instead of picking them up.  Made even worse at work when difficult-to-eat just isn't cutting it.  I only made 1/4 the recipe and I'm glad of that, though I did finish them off.

I only changed a few things with this recipe.   I only had 3 cans of black beans and 1 can of pinto beans in the cupboard, so I threw in a can of kidney beans and mixed them all up. I also added taco seasoning to the bown rice and used frozen corn instead of canned. It turned out GREAT! Perfect for taking to work. Made 13 LARGE wraps.

Was a little boring- nothing new or interesting, except the idea to throw in corn into mexican burritos. Easy though, still glad that have a vat of lunches now in my freezer! so in the end I'm glad I tried. I think this recipe is only for a person tackling burritos for the first time, otherwise you can do better.

Excellent! I made these so my husband would have something easy to grab at 4am on his way out to work instead of buying lunch all the time. I added 4tsp. tapatio and used white rice instead of brown because thats what I had. I would say its probably going to be a little dry though unless you use some salsa or sour cream on top when you eat. Very great! Thank you for the idea!

I made these last weekend and brought them for lunch twice last week.  I bring my lunch daily, so I get tired of the usual sandwiches and frozen dinners.  I did reduce the serving size by half and I still had more of the corn/bean/rice mixture than I did tortillas.  I just froze the rest of the mixture to use later.  I would recommend adding some spices to the mixture_it's a little bland.  I topped mine with a little sour cream and salsa.  My husband even ate one for lunch and said he liked it and he's not a big fan of wraps.

I enjoyed this recipe and felt great that it was nutritious and high in fiber. However, it was lacking a certain kick or oomph that I was looking for. I felt it needed a little salt and I wanted to drizzle Texas Pete or another hot sauce all over it. I think the next time I make these, I will try some the recommendations made by other reviewers with regards to caramelized onions and other extras. I think that would make this a bit more flavorful. I did use quinoa in this recipe which I enjoyed. It's nice to add that extra bit of protein. Thanks for the great lunch idea.

These are scrumptious!  I made a few adjustments to fit my tastes (taco seasoning with the rice, salsa instead of canned tomatoes, added fresh cilantro & left out the pinto beans) and found that multi-grain tortillas do not fold nearly as well as the flour ones! Next time I'll stick with flour tortillas and I'm sure it will be delish!

Oh man were these good. I gave 4 stars only because I had to doctor the filling a little to give it more flavor. I halved the recipe, and added 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/4 tsp. oregano, 2 Tbsp. chopped cilantro, a splash of lime juice, and some salt and pepper. I also used mild salsa instead of the tomatoes. Perfect! - we can't keep our hands off them!

What a great recipe! Super convenient to grab in the morning and heat in the microwave at work. As a vegetarian, I'm always looking for new meat-free lunch ideas, and I will continue making this healthy dish. I used whole wheat tortillas and added chopped onion, chili powder, garlic powder, and ground cumin. I think it would have been bland without the spices. Thank you!

As others have noted, this recipe is very bland unless you add seasoning. I recommend cooking the rice in vegetable stock and sauteing onions, tomatoes, hot peppers (I used 2 Hungarian hot peppers), corn, and beans in a sauce pan with salt, pepper, cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.

Very good..Although I only made 1/4 of the recipe and it made ALOT of rice/bean/cheese mixture. I did not use the pinto beans. But I did use a spanish rice and mild salsa with some mexicorn. Used lowfat cheese to help with high calorie count(thats why I gave it 4/5 stars). May try to bake it with a little more salsa. Will make again..yumm good stuff!

A tiny bit bland, but a good idea if you have a houseful of picky eaters.  Top with your favorite salsa, and you have lunches to go for a long time!

These wraps are so easy to make and stick in the freezer for when you need a quick lunch. I only used half the amount of rice and beans called for but left everything else the same. I also added some Taco Seasoning I (from this site) because other reviewers had complained they were a bit bland, but next time I wont add the extra taco seasoning.

I really liked the concept of this recipe, but was so disappointed with the flavor...there was none.  But that can easily be fixed.  I will try it again with taco seasoning and/or a different filling from another recipe.

Very good.  To add a bit of extra flavor, I dip in a touch of balsamic vinagarette or other light dressing as I eat!

I followed a few of the suggestions like corn, cilantro, etc.. and I omitted rice, and these are still fantastic. I love these for lunch time and like to always keep them stocked in the freezer.

I made changes to spice it up & also b/c I wanted to use what I had on hand.  The recipe changed, but I give 5 stars for the concept.  YUM- these were awesome!!!!!!  I halved the recipe, next time I will make the full amount.

I added 1lb ground turkey, cooked that with taco seasoning.  Rice: I added a chicken boulion cube, and packet of sazon.  Cooked as directed.

Didn't have any black beans or pinto, I used 1 can of kidney beans. A handful of fresh chopped cilantro, and green onion.

Mixed all together, and used whole wheat wraps to keep the healthy aspect.  This had GREAT flavor!!!!

I made a batch of these exactly like the recipe said.  They looked so good I had to try one right away and it was great!  Next time I might half the recipe as 16 is a lot of wraps to keep in the freezer.

These are quite easy to make and you can be really flexible with the ingredients.  I left the chilies and added tofu and it turned out great. Since I find them a little bland, I add some salsa to them and then, in my opinion, they are delicious.  So easy to bring to work and heat up quickly

These were very good.  Unfortunately for me to take them to work the tortilla was mushy when I reheated.  Would be best heated in the oven or toaster oven straight out of the freezer.

I found this bland, but a great idea.  If I try this again, I think I'll use a spicy salsa instead of the canned tomatoes.

This is a great recipe for anyone with little time during the week who is trying to eat healthy. I followed the recipe but I made my wraps a little smaller (for caloric reasons) and ended up with about 40 of them.

I made these to freeze for my vegetarian daughter to take to school.  I couldn't find tomatoes with chilis so used fresh chopped and medium cheddar since that is what I had.  It was a bit bland so I added some greek dressing, wrapped it in whole wheat tortillas.  She ate them all quickly, so they must have been pretty good.

I made a half recipe, and there was a lot left over.  I doubled the chiles and tomatoes.  I really liked this recipe.  Perfect for lunch heated up about 40 seconds in the microwave.  I'm not a vegetarian, and I liked this a lot.

These wraps were fantastic! I added some chopped fajita seasoned chicken and a little cheddar just cuz I needed to get rid of it, and left out the tomatoes & chiles, but they were still great! It made so many... I had to go to the store to buy more tortillas because I ran out halfway through!! :) Thanks so much, these are great, cheap to make and so convenient!!

Basic recipe very good the only thing I changed was to add two Tbsp milled Flax seed, used frozen corn, fresh chopped tomatoes and chilies and whole wheat tortillas to reduce some of the sodium add omega 3 oils  and healthy it up a bit.

The taste is a little bit bland. I listened to a lot of reviews. I made the rice with broth. Next time I make these I will add some meat. I added enchilada sauce on the top of mine after I've heated them. I will make these again. thanks

These are great!  I changed it up just a touch---decrease black beans by 1 can and added shredded chicken.  Also a little bit of garlic powder.  It is easy and yummy!  Will definitely make again.

The only reason I gave them 3 stars was for the blandness in the rice. I added some homemade sofrito which is a pureed blend of spices and vegetables.I also cooked the rice longer brown rice seems to be on the gritty side. otherwise they are great for work and my very busy husband.

Good recipe. Not a big bean fan but good for those who are. Good with salsa and sour cream.

This was a very easy recipe to make and turned out pretty good.  I tend to like lots of flavor, and these wraps have a mild flavor, even with the diced tomatoes and green chiles.  

The ingredients are easy to find and easy to keep on hand to make this recipe whenever you are ready.  Canned ingredients always provide the simplest way to make a meal, so this is quite a time-saver.

The wraps are healthy and I would recommend trying them out to see if they suit your tastes!

This is a fantastic way to a healthy lunch!!!! I cut the beans in half and only use a block of pepperjack and some time a half block of cheddar. My husband even loves these and he is a picky eater!!!

I give this 3 stars for the idea, but the recipe is way too much.  Feel free to play with what is in these wraps.  I love the cilantro idea and I will try chicken next time.

These are pretty tasty, but a bit dry.  Next time I will add 2 cans of Rotel, or just some salsa to the mix.  Very convenient, however.

This does make a ton!  My fiance was very confused by all the burritos in the freezer.  I didn't give it 5 stars because this morning I thought to bring one, but shen I didn't have salsa to pour over it I chose not to.  Good when covered in salsa.

These are great!  I have passed this recipe around my office.  I use double the amount of tomatoes/chilis - but I think I will use others' suggestions and try salsa or cilantro for more kick.  Great recipe for families on the go!

I'm still a beginner chef, so I use brown minute rice.  My husband lives/works 2 hours away so he needs plenty of lunches prepared ahead of time.  He loves when I make these wraps and they last FOREVER!!  Great recipe and extremely simple.

Awesome!  I added cubed, cooked chicken, a small can of tomato sauce and a little chili pepper and cumin for more of a southwest taste.  This made 30 wraps using 8" tortillas.  Very filling and delicious!

I modified it slightly.  Only one cup of brown rice, two cans of beans, can of rotel, and 1 cup of cheese.  didn't drain the beans (black beans with jalapenos & lime juice and chili beans) and left out the corn.  It made two packages of small tortillas and we had to open another package of large tortillas to use up the rest of the filling.  They turned out so good!

I made these for a vegetarian co-worker after she had a baby.  She and her husband raved about them!  I did add a little more cheese.  I found I had quite a bit of filling left over so I put the extra in another container and took to her to eat as a salad.

Pretty good, definatly add some cilantro and salsa, and season the rice or it may be a little to bland to eat alone. Really good with salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. Simple to make, and take!

One day I went to make these and decided I was too lazy to wait for the rice to cook, so I bought quick-cooking Japanese soba noodles and used those instead.  It turned out great, I really recommend trying that!

My husband like these wraps!  We're thinking it may need salsa?  Although we did use 1/2 can of jalepeno peppers. We also cut the recipe in half and still filled 16 wraps.  They're quite tasty!

I sprinkled a little cumin into every wrap and 1/2 teas,minced jalepeno.  It made at least 20 wraps.  I found defrosting them in the micro made them a little wet.  It would be best to take them out the night before.  Either way is ok because I read the reviews and totally agree with putting a little low.fat margarine all over defrosted roll and browning in a frying pan. Really good.  We have also had these for dinner when I don't know what to make or don't feel like cooking.  My husband smears his browned roll in salsa.  Very healthy, thanks, Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

Very tasty, meat free dish.  I didn't like the way they reheat though, the tortilla is falling apart before the insides are hot, but very tasty.  The filling is even good as a side dish.

This is a great recipe! It really makes a healthy lifestyle easier! Next time I make them I will add some seasonings such as salt, garlic powder, etc. I used the burrito size tortillas and I was able to make 18 wraps.

I thought this recipe was great.  I added an additional can of diced tomatoes and green chiles.  I also added a medium red onion and some fresh cilantro.  It just spiced it up and made it more flavorful.  It definately makes more than 16 so be prepared.  Wonderful for a quick lunch.

This was great!I followed the recipe exactly. If your not a fan of brown rice, you really don't notice it. This was easy and very cheap to make. I have lunch for 16 days for only about $7.00. Very filling and VERY TASTY!
