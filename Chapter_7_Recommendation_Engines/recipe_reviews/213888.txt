Thanks Bobby!  Love us a big wedge salad on a warm evening!  I added a little worcheshire, fresh cracked pepper and garlic powder to the dressing.  Our homegrown tomato really added to the whole taste.

I used light mayonnaise and turkey bacon. This was SO good and so simple. I don't know why I haven't made this before! Next time, I might use half light mayonnaise, half fat-free sour cream and add a little spices. But as is, it was tasty!
