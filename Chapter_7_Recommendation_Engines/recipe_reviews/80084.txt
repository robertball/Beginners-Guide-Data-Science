I'm not sure why these have such a low rating because I thought they were delicious. After mixing all the ingredients I did find they were a bit dry (though not so dry that I couldn't form them into balls) so I just added another large dollup of peanut butter and they were perfect. I also added some butterscotch chips to the chocolate for dipping because I like the flavour of the two together.

This is really similar to the recipe that my grandmother has passed on to the girls over the years. We use pecans instead of walnuts and add butterscotch chips to the chocolate chips for the coating. Also to make the coating harden a little better and a little more shiny we add a half a block of edible food wax (found in baking isle).

I can't believe I found this recipe. Thank you so much COGRANDMA4!! These are what my mother made and I like them so much better than the traditional buckeyes. The variety of textures and flavors! You are right...decadent!! I did use pecans instead only because that is what mom did and we're a pecan family.

making these for holiday gifts super easy and really good. Everbody loves them added they freeze well I like to roll them in the chocolate and drizzle with opposite color like white and black or get creative cost them in white and drizzle red and green it's pretty and festive
