I did not have the Panasonic convection oven called for in the recipe.  Just cooked the chicken on the stove and put everything in the oven for about 15 minutes on 425.  Turned out really good.

Outstanding!  I was skeptical about this one as I don't like jarred Alfredo sauce.  Wrong!  Fabulous!  I picked up artichoke hearts in oil by mistake, but it didn't matter.  We used the leftover oil on the portobello mushrooms instead of olive oil.  There was a ton of filling, so don't be afraid to pack it on - the stuffing isn't going to melt and slide off.  My husband,  who loves spinach dip and mushrooms wasn't into this dish until it was done and he did a sample bite.  My mushroom became his mushroom.  The only other change I made besides using leftover oil is that I omitted the red pepper flakes as the kids don't like them.

Delicious! This came together in a snap and was so easy to cook in the Panasonic induction oven. The flavors blended so well! I served this as a main dish w/ a big salad, but I think this would be great as a side by omitting the chicken or even as an appetizer in the smaller mushrooms. I did use light Alfredo sauce, but that was my only change. Oh also, I wasn't sure if the artichokes were supposed to be marinated or not, so I used marinated, which was great. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Loved this.   I did add some mozzarella cheese to this also.  Scaled down to 2 mushrooms.  Kept the spinach the same,  used a little less than 1 chicken breast, and added enough vegan alfredo sauce just to bind.  I was going to precook the mushrooms, but I'm glad I didn't.  Cooked for 25 mins in my toaster oven.  Came out perfect.  Thanks for the post Soup Loving Nicole!

Turned out great. The recipe was perfect and the taste was amazing. I had 1 problem though the mushrooms leaked a lot and became a bit soggy. The bread I crisped up in the oven fixed everything, so dinner was successful. Can anyone let me know what I did wrong.

I used the ingredients stated in the recipe, but added a can of chopped mushrooms to the chicken mix and sprinkled some shredded Colby cheese on top for color. I used a NuWave oven placing the stuffed mushrooms on the 1" rack. I baked the stuffed mushrooms at 400 degrees for 14 minutes, and they were perfectly cooked.  Although everyone in my family enjoyed this recipe, I didn't give it 4 stars for 2 reasons. 1) I think the  chicken should be cooked prior to adding it to the stuffing mix. Other methods of cooking may not fully cook the chicken before the portobellos are over cooked. Also, the juices released by the chicken as it cooks may add too much moisture to the already moist stuffing. 2) In an excellent recipe, I think the flavors of all the ingredients should blend and one ingredient should not over power the others. In this recipe, one ingredient, which I believe to be the Parmesan cheese,  was overpowering. I will make this recipe again, but next time will try using a milder cheese. I must also comment that the amount of stuffing made could easily have filled 6-8 large portobello mushroom caps. Using it for 4 caps, they were huge, and easily a large meal by themselves.

This turned out to be the perfect recipe for a night that needed a quick meal.  Looks so elegant, but comes together very quickly although I did think it needed an additional dose of garlic.

I was really excited for this recipe, especially after I saw someone didn't make it with the panasonic. However the artichokes were too over powering for me. I loved the kick of the red pepper, but I won't be making it again.
