I doubled the amount of flour mixture..it didnt seem like it would be enough for the amount of chicken we had...and turns out doubling it was just right. It was a bit spicy for my taste so maybe next time I'll keep the pepper to the original amount. This was very easy and smelled divine while cooking. I added onions and green peppers to the chicken while cooking which my boyfriend agreed was a nice touch. The nuts were also a pleasant surprise but made the dish a bit heavy on the stomach. We had a good amount left over which was great. Worth the effort!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe for the dry ingredients. I didn't have any nuts, and used thighs instead of breasts, and the chicken turned out fabulous. I served it with spanish rice, black beans, and corn. I'll def make again!!!!

Very good!!  Rubbed chicken with the spices (did double spices) and let them sit in the fridge for a few hours.  Chicken turned out very moist.  I used mine cold the next day on a salad and it was wonderful.  Next time I will take one persons suggestion to add some bell peppers and onions into the mix.

Delicious.  I didn't have any nuts but I can surely see how it would add a nice savory touch. My la familia loved this dish! It's a nice change from the regular "chicken breast" meals. I can totally see how adding a hint of "this and that" can personalize the dish such as BBQ sauce or Louisiana Rub. I added green bell peppers (I would have preferred red, except I didn't have any). I adore this meal and am pretty confident in it, so I will most definitely be making it again, this time for my ENTIRE family!

I added a little extra garlic powder, and didn't have poultry seasoning, so I added a pinch of rosemary, thyme and sage.  Otherwise I followed the recipe amounts for dry ingredients, and although I thought it wouldn't be enough coating, it was.  I also used half olive oil and half butter--next time I may reduce the butter a bit more.  I like the idea of adding onion (and maybe fresh garlic) next time.  This is an easy meal to make, with great results.  Oh--I used thighs instead of breasts, because that's what I had on hand.

I used this recipe just to make the chicken and also doubled the coating ingredients.  I omitted the Spanish rice and instead served it with green vegetables on the side.  My boyfriend adds hot sauce to everything, and this chicken does well with the extra kick.  I agree with another reviewer's comment that the chicken is also great the next day either on its own or on top of a salad.

We thought this was really good. The chicken mixed well with the rice. Only thing was when the chicken cooked it stayed gooey. It was like the butter wouldn't let the flour mixture create a crust.  But it still tasted great. Will def. make again.

I didn't have enough chicken, but made the rub with the same amount, and it was perfect. I also used almond flour instead of all-purpose flour. It has a delicious flavor, and like some others, I did add onions to the mix. So easy and will be doing this again!

This was super easy and delicious! I added just a tad more of the dry ingredients to fully coat my chicken pieces but this recipe was great! Will definitely make again especially when I need a quick meal!

This was an easy recipe to follow. I doubled the spices (per another review) and took 1.5 the flour. My family loved it!!!

My grandma isn't big on spicy food so when I made this I kept the spices to the recommendations (except paprika, we were out of cayenne) the only thing I doubled was the flour and it turned out perfect :)
