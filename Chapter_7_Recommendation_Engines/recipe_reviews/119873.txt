I learned this recipe from my grandmother when I was little. The only thing I would change is to add 1 tsp. Dijon Mustard for flavor and also instead of pancake syrup, I use Dark corn syrup. I make this every year for Christmas and Thanksgiving.

This was very good and will remain on my rotation. I used frozen baby lima beans (zapped in the microwave in water - didn't measure but just enough to cover the beans for about 8 mins).  I only made serving for 4.  I sauted my chopped bacon and onions together.  Then when the bacon/onion mixture was nicely caramelized and bacon not quite crisp, I added the beans and most of the water to my pan, thereby deglazing the pan. I simmered that as I added the other ingredients.  I only used 2 tbsp of brown sugar, used pure maple syrup and added as squirt of dijon mustard.

My mom, dad, and brother loved this recipe. I must be honest though, it was a little wierd to me because the lima beans were HUGE. I am used to baked beans being really little. I am going to try this recipe again with pink beans. The recipe was pretty sweet. I did add some dihon mustard like some people suggested. I like that the recipe was pretty simple to follow.

I just finished making this recipe.  It is Very Good!  I doubled the recipe, and used one package of Yves Meatless Canadian Bacon (6 oz.).  I diced and cooked the bacon in a small amount of butter before adding to the beans.  

The only thing I did different (besides using veggie bacon) is I added the raw onions at the end, along with the ketchup, sugar, maple syrup, etc.  I did not like the thought of boiling the onions with the bean water, and then throwing out most of the onion flavor with this waste water - I love my onions and didnâ€™t want to loose the nice onion taste!

My wife, who does not care for lima beans, did not like the smell of the plain beans when they were cooking, but, when everything was mixed at the end and baking in the oven, it smelled great.  My wife and I, and our two boys loved the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

By the way, the doubled recipe fit nicely in our large bean pot.

Wow! These are the BEST version of lima beans I've found! Out of necessity I made some alterations. I used 1/2 tsp chili powder rather than hot sauce, added 1/2 tsp ground mustard, and used light corn syrup rather than pancake syrup. I also made a vegetarian version, so no bacon. Dilish!!!! Omg, sooo good. The aftertaste is incredible. p.s. I also followed a previous reviewers advice and only used 1/2 a c of ketchup and 1/4 c light corn syrup. For me, there was more than enough sauce.

This is SO yummy! I actually used frozen beans and just added the onions with the other ingredients. I can't believe the flavor in these beans! I also added a little bit of chopped garlic. I will make again!

That's over a cup of sugar!!  when you add whatever on earth "pancake" syrup is.  There are at least 5 kinds of Pancake syrup.   Dah....so I am presuming she means "maple"  or fake maple.  For 16 oz of beans???  Just put sugar bowl on table.  sooo cut sugar a bit add some mustard powder.  double the bacon or better yet use salt pork

Very unhappy with recipe...ended up draining most of sugar off and starting over.   Still bland and sweet.

Made these yesterday.  YUM!  I substitued dark molasses for the pancake syrup,  as I have a tendency to prefer things less on the sweet side, and 1 tsp dry mustard for the hot sauce, had only 1/4 C ketchup on hand so added a 4 oz can of tomato sauce, PERFECT!  And to my great surprise the husbamd loved them too!  We'll make these often!  Thanks for sharing!

My oldest daughter & I love lima beans so we chose this for our sidedish with last night's dinner. Overall taste was really good, but I just wish there was a little more sauce--I thought the beans were a teeny bit dry as the recipe turned out--but my daughter loved it as is.

Very good! Better than your ordinary baked beans. Have always had baked beans made from small white navy beans but really enjoyed it with the baby lima beans.  (I don't think the large lima beans would be as good though- so I suggest choosing the baby lima bean variety).  The sauce was very good too.  I followed ingredient amounts as listed and thought it needed all the sauce.  I would not recommend cutting back on the ketchup and sugar as others have suggested.  The beans would end up too dry in my opinion.  I did add about 2 tsp Dijon mustard to give it a little extra zing, but I've always thought mustard was the secret ingredient to fabulous baked beans anyway.  I didn't have a bean pot and used my heavy Dutch Oven instead.  Worked great and has a lid already instead of dealing with tin foil and a casserole dish.

These are so good! Better than the beans in a can if you ask me. Will make often.
Made these again last night, but used 1/2 of the brown sugar and then doubled the maple syrup, using sugar free. Still tasted good without all of the sugar!

Loved this recipe, only I made it "vegetarian" without the bacon. It was still marvelous. Will make it again often.
