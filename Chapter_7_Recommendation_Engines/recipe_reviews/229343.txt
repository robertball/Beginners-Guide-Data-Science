Having a French Canadian mom that loved mashed potatoes meant we had Pate Chinois weekly in winter!  For a really quick meal, I'll double it, use the frozen mashed potatoes (no peeling required) and make an extra for the freezer.

I've been eating this dish since I was born-Wonderful stapel. I crush potato chips on the top before I bake it with a little butter-Nice crunch

I grew up eating Chinese Pie in southern NH. My mom (French-Canadien) made it regularly but she used Campbells vegetable soup instead of corn. (I hated it as I hated most vegetables) Then we got a cafeteria at my grade school in 6th grade and they had it on the lunch menu with CORN! I told my mom I loved it and she made it with corn after that! After I became an adult, I learned that it is very tasty with the Campbell's soup also.

This is a plain shepherd's pie which is incredibly easy to put together once your mashed potatoes are made. I wish I had the memories to tie to this dish (I totally understand that), but felt it was plain. A+B = C.  In this case - it's literally ground beef, creamed corn and mashed potatoes (it wasn't transformed into something else).  I did like how the creamed corn added a sauce.

This recipe sounded weird when I read it, but we tried it and love it!!  It has become a staple in our house.  As for the Cook's Note at the bottom of the recipe, I never use real mashed potatoes because I don't like the consistency of them, I always use instant potatoes and have never had a problem.  Yummy!

This is how my mother from Vermont made this and I really love it.  We too called it Chinese Pie but I have heard it called Shepard's Pie and most people do not make it with the cream corn but I find the cream corn is what makes it soooo good.  I love this dish.

The recipe is fine as is, but my suggestion is to add a finely chopped green pepper (sauteed with the onion), and we use ground turkey.  My grandmother, too, put butter and paprika on top of the potatoes for a little added color and flavor.  I also add a can of regular corn, in addition to the creamed corn.  True comfort food.

I too grew up with my French Canadian grandmother and I ate this a lot and its one of my all time favorite foods! We called it Shepherd's Pie. I've always used one can cream and one can regular corn. My Grandma put pats of butter and sprinkled some paprika on top. It is a plainer version than other Shepherd's pies but its the only one I make. Enjoy!

2 cans of creamed corn was to much. I would suggest 1 can of creamed and 1 can of corn.  Very tasty

My mother is from Rhode Island & is French. She made this for us when we were growing up. Years ago when I made it for my husband he suggested putting grated cheddar cheese on it. So I have been making it that way ever since! 
Love it!

This recipe is comfort food that is easy and basic. I have always called this Shepard's Pie but I did get the recipe from a Canadian friend many years ago. I do use onion powder instead of onions because my kids can be picky if they see onions.

I grew up in northern Minnesota and never knew this dish had a name. I grew up eating this as a kid, it’s very versatile and you can swap the cream corn for fresh cooked carrots or regular corn. We always had it with our favorite meatloaf recipe in place of the ground beef. It’s delicious- literally everyone who has ever tried it loves it. I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I prefer it with a more flavorful meatloaf instead of the ground beef.

Great  traditional Chinese pie like my mother made when I was a kid. Great recipe and easy to make. Much simpler than shepherds pie, it has less ingredients. It’s a huge hit with the whole family.

Having grown up with a French Canadian mother and grandmother, this is familiar fare to me. They made it exactly as written. When it was time for me to make my own Pate Chinois (Chinese Pie), the cream corn had to go; whole kernel corn and even mixed vegetables substitute well. The Italian side of me likes more flavor in my hamburger, so I add one clove of minced garlic, 1/2 to 1 tsp. basil, and a little Worcestershire sauce and herb blend called Old World. Perfect! In fact I think my ancestors would approve.

My kids love this and ask for it constantly - it's been a  favorite for several years now.  Easy and hearty, what more could we ask for?!  We used instant mashed potatoes, and put cheddar on top.  Thanks for the recipe!

My mother made this weekly, for my 4 siblings and I. We always called it "Chinese Pie". I never knew that it was also called "Sheperds pie", until I made it for my husband, his mother made the same dish, but slightly different version. I use whole kernel corn, add a jar of beef gravy to the cooked ground beef, and also add paprika, salt and pepper to the top!

This is great and my six year old loved it. She ate it for three out of four meals. I used ground turkey. I used green pepper instead of onion and added it at the end of browning the turkey.
