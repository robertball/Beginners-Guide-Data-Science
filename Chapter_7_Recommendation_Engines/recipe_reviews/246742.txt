OMG... I had serious doubts, but was willing to try it... It turned out like a light-chocolate, dry sponge... that's the nicest thing I can say :-)

I used chocolate whey powder, added a tablespoon of cocoa powder and a little cinnamon. It has good, chocolate flavor and it had the macros we were after. It was on the spongy side, and more cake like than brownie.  I baked it for 15 minutes exactly in a glass pie plate.  Next time I make it, I will add half of a mashed banana to moisten it up and/or bake a couple of minutes less. 8 servings resulted in 99 calories per serving, 2 carbs, 5 fat grams and 11 protein grams, per My Fitness Pal. Not an outstanding brownie, but a good treat for the macros. It would be extra tasty under some Halo Top ice cream!

Followed instructions exactly and knew it wouldn’t be like a real brownie but OMG it was so bad. It was super super dry and chalky and not worth it at all. Nice try but can’t replace the real thing! :(

Great recipe for a protein powder brownie. Tastes good but not as good as a traditional brownie.

the taste was ok it had a dry cake texture and looked spongy but if you're counting carbs and want something to snack without cheating worth a try. Nothing beats the real thing
