A winner.  The list of ingredients was intimidating but we put it together and simmered it down to a very nice meal.  Cutting the portion to 9 created almost a full gallon.  More actual flavor than simple chili.

Very good!  I cut the recipe down to 4 servings and because of this I only needed one can of beans so I went with the classic kidneys. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that there were too many pots/skillets and it tasted like it was missing something.  Instead of all the dirty pans, I cooked the bacon in a dutch oven then put it aside, then put the ground turkey (I don't usually eat beef) in the same dutch oven.  When it was almost cooked, I added the onion/celery/peppers.  Then completed step 2, and moved on to adding the beans and seasonings.  This seemed so much simpler!  The missing ingredient that really rounded out the flavors was tomato paste.  Will absolutely make this again, following my simple tweaks and adding the tomato paste.  Hubby loved it!

Really good chili!  I used green chiles in the chili and subbed grape juice and red wine vinegar for the wine.  I changed the servings from 25 to 12 but still used a pound of bacon.  This recipe doesn't need measured, just dump it all in and it will be great.  The kids and everyone else ate it up.

This is a terrific chili....made a day ahead. I made it in advance yesterday and I didn't think much of it then. Fast forward today.....YUMMY! My only change was to not overdo the prep. Brown the bacon, browned the meat and then cooked the chopped vegis in a lttle of the reserved fat. Added all the seasonings, liquids and beans and it made it so much easier. Thanks so much for sharing!

This had a wonderful robust flavor.  I only left out the brown sugar.  Oh, and added extra garlic :)

Great Chili. I too was a little afraid of all the ingredients. I had to buy several of them. But it was a great bowl of chili. We make again. Going to freeze some and see how to taste later.

This has to be the best Chili ever!  My entire family just loves this.  I have never been able to make a good chili, but this one is the best.  A lot of ingredients, was a little intimidating, but worth getting all the ingredients!

Killer Chili Haiku: "This was quite tasty! I made it a day ahead. Simmered it long time." I honestly don't think that long ingredient list is entirely necessary (some of the spices just get lost in the shuffle), but I still followed the recipe faithfully. I made it a day ahead, refrigerated it, then simmered it covered for the entire next afternoon. It was really good on a cold night, although I'll happily eat chili in the summertime too.

I didn't add the tabasco, and it was a bit too spicy for me with the hot pepper flakes. I would lessen the amount I put in next time.  I also made enough for 12 people, not 24.

Very good chili recipe. I followed it exactly except for the bacon which I didn't have. I was surprised that I had everything else! (Had to sub onion powder for the dried onion though). A keeper!
