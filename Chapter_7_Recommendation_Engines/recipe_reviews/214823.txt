This is my recipe and I have to say something about the amount of liquid in this recipe. When I order this at my favorite mexican resteraunt, the consistancy is about the same as my recipe, with extra "sauce". The reason I think this is awesome is because when I wrap my filling in my tortillas, I like to dip my tortilla in the extra sauce. OR, I like to be all ghetto and save the leftover sauce and mix it with my Take-Out Fake-Out Mexican Rice and either eat it as is or wrap THAT in a tortilla. Either way, I make it that way for that reason just because the recipe is so good that I don't want to waste one drop of it's awesomeness. No, I'm not being conceited, it's just really that good. You've got to take my word on that. Or just make it for yourself.

This was a serious disappointment.  I was thinking about it all day and once I tried it, I realized what I was thinking was absolutely true.  This would be bland and entirely too much liquid to use for rolled tacos.  Maybe if you reduce the liquids some flavor would come through.

This was DELICIOUS!  It's going to be a regular in our house from here on out!  The only changes I made was that I used fresh Anaheim chili and I used Chipotle hot sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!

made this for my girls at work. had to sub tomato paste for ketchup and evap milk for heavy cream ( something i learned from the recipe author actually) and this was so good. ive never had the authemtic kind so i cant compare but they loved this and asked for seconds. it served 6 women and 2 staff members with some leftovers. we did actually put some salsa verde on these and some people opted cheddar and sour cream to top them with but i ate mine as is and didnt want to add anything. thank you sarah.

I made this the other night and my husband and I are HUGE fans! I was feeling a tad lazy that night so I bought a rotesserie chicken and peeled it apart instead of having cubes. I only let it simmer for about 10 minutes because I did not want the cream to burn. I really love creole seasoning with creamy sauces so I put a couple of shakes into the pot too. I a couple of spoonfuls of the yumminess  on a semi homemade tortilla (the raw ones in the refrigerated section) on a bed of baby spinach and it was wonderful!

I ate Pollo Con Crema at the 3 Margaritas restuarant in Colorado and had to try making it myselft.  I am so excited that this recipe turned out exactly like it!  Wonderful!  I serve it with mexican rice and warm tortillas.

Just made this delicious meal tonight. I cut the recipe in half because its just me and my husband. I did change a few things because I did not have all the ingredients and I wanted to make it a little more healthy. I did not use the mushrooms because I forgot to buy some. However, I opted out the heavey cream and used half and half ( if you make the roux accordingly you can use any kind of milk you have on hand because it will thicken it.) Additionally, I added more hot pepper sauce and used just plain old chilli powder (1 tbsp). Also, my husband thought we should have added more hot sauce and red pepper flakes, which I agreee, but this depends on how spicey you like things. One trick: Heat the chicken broth and milk in the microave first until warm because it thickens more quickly in the pan without burning the milk. Other than that I followed the directions exactly. I served it with rice and mexican cheese. It was so good. We have tons of left overs. We cannot wait to eat it tomorrow. Also, I think if you follow the recipe exactly - you definitely get way more servings than 12 more like 16.

This sounds so much like my fave dish the Pollo Loco from my fave Mex Grill. They add lots of poblano peppers in strips along with onion in strips and a few chunks of fresh jalopeno with the sliced mushrooms. Its so good I could drink the sauce:) I dont eat mine with tortilla's but over rice or plain if I am going low carb. But if you eat with tortilla everyone knows that you fork the meat and veggies into the tortilla and then dip in the sauce or drizzle the sauce over rice...sillies. Also good with lime margaritta's;) Thanks for the recipe.

This was wonderful!

I think the chicken breasts I used must have been on the small side- because there was a lot of sauce, and could have used more chicken. I didn't have any dried anaheim or Californnia chiles, so I used chopped green chiles. I also put the filling in a corn tortilla instead. It was wonderful!

Made this for dinner tonight with mexican rice. It was SO delicious! My husband took a couple of bites and said, "We're definitely going to have to add this to our list of favorite dinners!" Our toddler gobbled it up even faster than we did! Thank you for this awesome recipe!!

Pollo Con Crema is seriously my favorite thing to order at a mexican restaurant. I like to control the fat, salt and ingredients that go into my food - so began my quest for a recipe. I found one!!!
Delish. Dangerous and delish - could totally blow my diet!! I ate the left overs for days and didn't care less.
I made it to the letter and it was really good, my own personal preference items I would change would be half the red pepper, twice the mushroom and more cream sauce. 
I can't wait to try more of these "take-out fake-out" recipes from Sarah Jo.

I LOVE this recipe. I usually add some mozzarella cheese because my family and I have always loved white cheese sauces. It makes for some fun stringy sauce. This last time I made it, I put in some lime juice, just about 3 good squeezes from the bottle. I also didn't have all of the heavy cream, so I added a bit more sour cream till the consistancy seemed right. Mmm mmm mmm! My family of 4 ate nearly the whole 12 servings...so good with salsa and chips!

I didn't have boneless skinless breasts so I used bone in chicken thighs that I removed the skin from. It obviously took longer to cook these, but other than that, I didn't make any changes. My family all loved this.  The only complaint one son had was that it was so creamy that he chose to shred the tortilla and place it on top rather than try to roll it up! Not a bad thing, much prefer creamy chicken to dried out chicken recipes! Thanks, Sarah!

slightly modified this recipe - servings were for 4 - reduced the chicken to 1 breast half but used about the same, maybe added extra, for vegis - didn't use heavy cream, used 1%, didn't use ketchup, used tomato sauce, I also added just about a 1/2-1 tea of chili flakes - REALLY, REALLY good....I'm excited to make again....served with rice, left out the tortillas....

I followed the recipe exactly, no subsititues. It is excellent. I would have added more spice, but have little ones eating it too. I'll just add more for me! Made a lot...does it save?

Delicious! I did make a few minor substitutions. Instead of heavy cream I used cream cheese - 87 pounds of it seemed heavy enough. I didn't have bell peppers on hand so I rang a bell - hopefully blue is a good enough substitute for red. I don't live in California (Anaheim or otherwise) so I left out the optional chilies. And finally, my name is not Frank but I am red hot enough that I left that out as well. Overall I thought it was a pretty good home version of pollo con crema.

We liked this a great deal. It makes alot, but there was no trouble using up the excess sauce. We did make a few substitutions based on what we had on hand.

I worked at a Mexican restaurant for years, and maybe this was just different from what I was used to... I found the cumin in this recipe to be overwhelming and the sauce was lacking that extra something that makes you say, "mmmm."

At the restaurant, they made their pollo con crema with wonderful homemade enchilada sauce and some sour cream (about 2 parts enchilada sauce to 1 part sour cream). Maybe it's just what I'm used to, but that would be a heck of a lot easier and tastier (using canned enchilada sauce, of course!) :P

I made changes to suit my family's taste, so I'm just rating based on the methods and sauce flavor. This was almost exactly what I was looking for! I love the Pollo Con Crema at my local place, and was excited to try this copycat version. 

I felt the sauce was still missing a little something, so I'll go back to the restaurant one more time for comparison's sake, and see if I can't nudge it closer. :) I also need to find a better seasoned rice to accompany it, which should help with recreating the dish I have in mind.

This was delicious! It is very helpful if you have all the ingredients out and chopped/prepared before you begin.  The extra sauce it made was yummy for dipping the tortilla into.  Some in the family just ate it in a bowl over rice.  Some preferred it without the veggies, which I anticipated, so I kept those separate from the chicken and sauce mixture and combined it all together after veggie haters were served. I just used plain chili powder since that is all I had.  Recipe author Sarah Jo, all your reviews and recipes are the best!

I changed some things based on my experiences with this dish  as a take out or eat in at several Mexican restaurants.
A lot of extra ingredients in this and vegetables should be a bit less conspicuous. the chicken should look natural and chunked, not cubed.

I followed your recipe.  However, i made a cpl changes to meet my tastes.  I used about 1/3 tsp of cumin and added more salt as well as pepper and about a cup of sour cream.  Also added 1/2 tsp of mexican seasoning. Your recipe was a baseline..  thank you..

Used 6 chicken breasts instead of 4 because of amount of sauce for leftovers. This was better than our fav Mexican Restaurant!

So good!  My boyfriend eyed the finished product doubtfully, but gobbled up every bite he was served.  It even made for good leftovers.  I'll be making this again!
