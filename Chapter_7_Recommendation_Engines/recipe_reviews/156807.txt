I made this as an appetizer for my New Years party. Everyone RAVED over it. I thought I had plenty but it was gone way too fast. I made a few small changes, but mine was still essentially the same. What I did: used chicken broth instead of beef, used Foster's brand beer, omitted chili-garlic sauce but added cayenne and flaked red pepper to taste, roasted my own red peppers on the grill, grilled the bratwurst after boiling to brown them, then sliced them into bite-size pieces and returned to the sauce. DELICIOUS!

this was delish!  I made it for a seniors group so I used diced green chilis instead of the jalapenos and used all beef broth instead of the beer.  It was still great.  Next time I make it just for us, I will use the heat and the beer!

This was alright; I put everything in a crockpot and sliced the brats to make them easy to eat with toothpicks for our football party.  I also ended up taking the brats out and searing them on both sides which firmed them up and added flavor; then I put them back in the crock with a bit of cumin...which helped the flavor.
