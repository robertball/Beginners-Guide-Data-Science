First let me say, that I always find it less than amusing when someone changes an ingredient (or several) in a recipe and then remarks the dish was not as good as expected. 

That said, I did change some of the ingredients in this recipe ONLY because I had chicken breasts on their last legs (so to speak) defrosted in the fridge and I had to cook them last night. 

So I went ahead and made the marinade but substituted lime and lemon juice with margarita mix. What can I say? It's the only citrus I had available! But my, oh my, what a fantastic result! My husband raved about this chicken all night long and again today. 

I was only able to marinate it for a few hours, and I used the broiler instead of the grill, but the results were still spectacular. Wonderful flavor and very tender! I think the key is to cook them only the amount of time required and not a minute longer. 

I also reserved some of the marinade before soaking the breasts, so when they came out of the broiler I placed them immediately into the sauce. Oh my word. Heavenly. I mean, this is likely going to be the only marinade I use for chicken breasts for some time to come. Can't wait to try it with the actual lime and lemon juice! Now, I'm wondering how this would work with shrimp...or pork...

OMG! Received this recipe from an internet friend and absolutely loved it! Only change I did was I used 2 tbsp whole grain mustard, and 1 tbsp dijon mustard, then used hand blender to smooth out marinade some. Cubed chicken and poured half marinade in bag with chicken and the other half in another bag to put in the freezer for future use and marinaded for 8 hours. Skewered chicken/green pepper/onion/pineapple and grilled on each side (4 sides) 2 minutes each, basting with a little left over marinade left out of the bags. It was wonderful! I'll be making this all summer! TY!

It was really good.  I like this kind of marinade.  When I throw stuff together on my own, I find that I use many of these same ingredients- mmm.  I didn't have time to marinate and grill but I put the marinade (made a 1/2 recipe) in a glass baking dish with the chicken (sliced up 2 boneless breasts to make cutlets) and baked at 350 until done.  I do that often in place of grilling chicken- the meat soaks up so much of the tasty marinade that way, and it's so fast.

Wonderful marinade.  Key to this recipe is to use fresh squeezed lemon and lime juice.  Concentrated juices tend to overpower the other flavors.  Recipe calls for 6-8 minutes of cooking time per side ~ please note if this doesn't seem long enough for  you, the citrus in the marinate makes the chicken cook faster.  Do not overcook as your chicken will turn rubbery.  Wonderful chicken to add to salads!  New favorite in our home!  Thanks Letsgggo for the submission.

I have made this several times due to the continuing requests from my son. Although this is awsome on the charcoal grill, I use this to marinate boneless/skinless chicken brests and then put them on the George Foreman.

This is an awesome marinade! The brown sugar makes a big difference.  I used the same amount of marinade for 3 chicken breasts that I pounded down thin used 3 tablespoons of olive oil vs. 6 and used dijon mustard instead of course ground.  I left the chicken in the marinade overnight.  The chicken soaked almost all of it up.  It smelled delicious coming off the grill and tasted even better.  This is a keeper.

Loved these!  Followed the recipe exactly and the results were very tasty.  Juicy, with just a touch of mellow sweetness and a bite of flavor.  I think this chicken would make a great chicken sandwich with swiss and honey mustard.  Will definitely make again.

I've used this marinade twice so far - once with grilled chicken kabobs, and once on grilled chicken breasts.  It is indeed a very good marinade, but it doesn't magically transform chicken breasts.   I highly recommend this recipe if you are looking for a good basic marinade.  I do not recommend this recipe if you are looking to astound your guests with your culinary genius (ha).

Absolutely delicious. I was a bit put off by the smell of the vinegar while preparing the marinade, but it added a nice tang to the end flavor. Used Jack Daniels Honey Dijon Mustard, added Lawry's Seasoned Salt, Crushed Red Pepper Flakes and upped the garlic to 4 cloves. I also used Canola Oil, and I think you could eliminate the Lemon Juice. Definitely marinate for the full 8 hours. Will make this again and again.
Thanks, Ruthie.

This chicken was very juicy and tender. We used large boneless skinless chicken breast and marinaded them for about 18 hours. We grilled them on the grill outside but I didn't have to oil the grill. Just let them cook throughly on one side before flipping. I didn't know exactly what coarse ground mustard was and at my grocery store they only had brown, regular and dijon. So I got brown spicy mustard. I also didn't have any olive oil so I just used veg. oil. They turned out wonderfully. This will definently go into my regular rotation!

I've been using this recipe for years now and it is the BEST marinade i've ever used. I lost my recipe and came to the site to look for it and got a little frantic when I couldn't find the exact one, finally an ingrediant search led me back to it. :) 

I also wanted to add a note for those saying it's bland because i've had it turn out that way a couple of times. Now I alwats marinade it over night, then let it sit out in room temperature for about a half an hour before grilling. Also, don't forget to taste the marinade as you're making it, this way you always adjust the seasoning to your liking. It's very important because not all lemons and limes provide the same amount of juice and they are important the success of this recipe. 

So leave it out at room temperature 30 minutes before grilling.
And always taste the marinade before addding the chicken so you can make adjustments.

I've made this twice now.  The second time I modified it just a little.  I left out the lemon and lime juice, (this seemed to toughen the chicken meat), I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 3 tablespoons of honey.  I used the chicken to make kabobs.  I brushed the used marinade over the kabobs before grilling.  YUM!

I have been making this recipe for some time now and it is the only recipe I have felt the need to post a review about.  I make the marinade exactly as the recipe calls and it is absolutely delicious.  But it is also easy to tweak for whatever you have in the house.  Any kind of venegar or mustard tastes fine with it and I often use lemon and lime juice instead of squeezing the citrus (I just eyeball it and use half as much lemon as lime) and it is also always delicious.  It is very hard to screw up this recipe.  This is definitely best for grilled chicken kabobs, but making kabobs is too time consuming, so I put a grill basket inside a 9x13 pan and pour my marinating chicken into it letting the marinade drip through to the pan.  I then cover the chicken with large chunks of onion, green/red/yellow peppers, and pineapple.  I take the whole pan to the grill and put the basket chicken side down on the preheated grill, then pour all the runoff marinade from the pan onto the veggie side of the basket so that everything is well coated with the marinade.  Let it grill on medium for about 10 min per side (until everything is nice and brown) and youve got tasty kabobs without the hassle.  I usually serve it over a bed of lettuce and make extra marinade as a dressing and turn it all into a salad.  My "shishkabob salad" is a huge hit with my husband and his friends.. and getting men to rave about salad is a testiment in itself.

I absolutely love, love, love this marinade!  I used it on 50 boneless skinless chicken breasts for my Dad's surprise 60th birthday party.  Ended up marinating for a full 24hrs and increased the garlic and lemon juice as I prefer those flavours to be a little stronger.  Everyone at the party raved about the amazing taste and how tender the chicken turned out.  You won't be disappointed!!!

I love this chicken!! I have made this several times already and have never been disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, except a few times I used honey mustard, which made it sweeter (I actually liked it more this way). I cooked it in the oven at 375 for about 45 minutes. I also made chicken kabobs with green pepper, pineapple, and onion, which I loved! Regardless of how this is made, the taste is unbelievable!

Good chicken, but not unbelievable.  I used dijon mustard and prebottled lime and lemon juice and marinated them overnight.  They had a nice overall flavor.

Fantastic recipe. Please do not use bottled lemon or lime juice. Fresh makes all the difference. No wonder one reviewer didn't think it was unbelievable. I used the George Foreman grill and it was still terrific.

One star off because the recipe said to discard the marinade after cooking the chicken.  I cut my boneless skinless breast halves into three strips each, trying to make more surface to absorb the flavor.   Marinaded them 24 hours.  The chicken was good, but not really flavorful until I added the marinade that I cooked (boiled on stove top for about ten minutes).   I served this with linguini and peas and used the cooked marinade on it also.   This was very good!   So glad I did not discard the used marinade.   It made all the difference to the dinner.

This is a very tasty recipe. Not sure what's "unbelievable" about it -- I was pretty sure it was going to be good from reading the ingredients! It doesn't say to do this, but when grilling boneless skinless chicken meat has sugar in the marinade, I always cut my breasts in half longways (sort of like butterflying them, only I finish the cut all the way through) so that I have more surface area to caramelize the sugars in the marinade. Thinner pieces of meat also absorb more marinade and cook faster, this is a win-win for me, and I think that vastly improves grilled chicken. I did that here, so I got that brown sugar & lime marinade caramelized on twice as many sides as if I hadn't cut them. I served this with grilled marinated asparagus. Thanks for the recipe!

Contrary to most reviews, I thought this was a very average marinade.  In my opinion, there are much better recipes available.

My family and I loved this marinade so much after trying it on some chicken breasts, that we ended up making a double batch of it and injected it in to two whole fryer chickens, let them sit in the fridge overnight, and then we smoked them on the grill the next afternoon. Everyone there loved the chicken and kept asking for the recipe!

Ok...where do I start?? This recipe is the BOMB!! Everyone needs to try this one. Hate mustard? Not to worry, it does not end up with a mustard taste. Hate Vinegar? No problem, no vinegar taste. Hate Lime & Lemon juice? Ditto once again.
We sat down to eat, my hubby said "Oh my Gosh! This chicken is Unbelievable" I just about died..I said what did you say, and he repeated it!! So....he loved it so much that he called it by it's name...without knowing the name!!
It is truly amazing. I marinated for 24 hours, and it was perfect to throw on the grill when I got home from work. I've never had chicken like this before.
I grilled it 2 minutes each side on very high heat to sear it, then basted a few times and grilled for about 4-5 minutes more per side. My breasts were about 3/4" thick, I pounded them before marinating, which I did for 24 hours. I probably added more garlic, but personal taste. Turned out perfect!!
Dry? NOT!
Difficult recipe? NOT!
Things I have on hand? YUP!
Taste: The best we have had!
This will be at least 1x week for us during summer & all year long. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this for 16 of our college kids.  I used 18 chicken breasts that we got a Sam's that were close to 1 lb. apiece.  I tripled the recipe and had plenty of marinade.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and the results were just as it's titled...Unbelievable.  This is the best chicken marinade I've ever had.  Out of 18 lbs of chicken only one small breast was left.  They absolutely loved it!

Great marinade - I made it just as it was written and everyone enjoyed the results.  I marinaded the chicken overnight, then placed 2 chicken breasts with some marinade into a freezer bag and froze.  Now I have several meals ready to be pulled out and grilled when needed.  This is a keeper!

I made this the other day and it turned out to be very good.  I did however find the directions to be confusing with regard to the mustard.  In the list of ingredients you mention using PREPARED coarse ground mustard.  Then in the actual directions when it comes to adding the mustard you refer to it as whole grain mustard.  To me, prepared mustard is not whole grain, but ground up mustard that is creamy.  I ended up using brown mustard because it looked closest to coarse ground.  Could you clarify this in the recipe?  Other than that, it's a great recipe!

What else can I say about this recipe,but OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! From the minute the chicken hits the marinade to the time it hits the table, the aroma makes your mouth water!! The chicken cooks great on the grill, holding in the flavor of the marinade all the way through! I marinaded overnight, which I would suggest. I will make my chicken from now on with this recipie!! WHAT A FIND!! Thanks Ruthie!!

This is a nice chicken marinade.  I like the hint of sweetness the brown sugar adds (in fact, I'd forgotten it was in the marinade until I was eating and detected a hint of sweetness).   It hasn't become my favorite chicken marinade, but it's a solid 4 and def worth giving a try if you're looking for a new marinade.  I followed the recipe to a "T" (minus the black pepper per personal taste).

This is a 10 star recipe!  I have made this several times, and the last time I made it for 50 people!  It is always so juicy and tender!  I make sure to let it marinate at least 6 hours, but the 24 is the best!  Even my husband who doesn't really like chicken, loved this!

We used this marinade to make chicken kabobs and it was wonderful.  I followed the ingredients as listed, except I used Dijon mustard.  Extremely yummy.

I have made probably 300 recipes from this site and this chicken is THE BEST I've made thus far!!!!  It was super flavorful and super moist.  Also a total kid pleaser, which is a huge plus!!  The only changes I made was dijonnaise in place of the coarse-ground mustard, 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3 and no lemon juice (because I didn't have any).  Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!  Thank you!

I have never been so impressed in a recipe that I've felt the need to rate it. However,  that changed after trying this one. I cook a lot. I use a lot of chicken, but this has become my husband's favourite!  

I tried it in the oven and on the grill and personally, i enjoy the oven version more. 

For the oven version,  i dredged the chicken in seasoned flour and browned it on the stove. I then put the pieces into a baking dish and poured the sauce over top. I covered it with aluminum foil and baked for about 40 minutes. Then i removed the foil  and put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes at 450 to kind of thicken and caramelize the sauce! Freaking amazing!!

This was super good!  I followed the recipe exactly. I marinated over-night. I opted to broil it in the oven verses the grill as our Wyoming winters do not always allow for outside grilling.  It came out perfectly and delicious. Thanks for sharing.

Got an email from allrecipes this morning and decided to make it today. I pounded the chicken breasts as thin as possible. Didn't have a lime so I used extra lemon juice. It's a keeper. Nice subtle taste of mustard with a sweet tangy base. A great summer marinade that can be prepared from things on hand.

This marinade for this recipe make a very juicy, delicious chicken breast. Everyone will like the taste of the chicken. It's very juicy and flavorful. I would recommend it soaking in the marinade overnight to get the fullest flavors possible! Don't let the vinegar smell of the marinade turn your nose up, you won't taste it at all.

This recipe was fantastic.  I have made it twice.  The first time, I used yellow mustard because that is all I had on hand.  It was still good but second time went with the ground mustard.  It was even better.  I used a little more lemon than called for, just a personal preference.  So good.  I would highly suggest tasting the marinade and tweaking it to your preference before adding chicken.  The cooking time is right on (I broiled because it was raining outside) and essential for moist chicken.

This is truly an UNBELIEVABLE Chicken marinade!  I cut some corners by only allowing the chicken to marinade for a few (4) hours but next time I will do the overnight thing to ensure that the flavors are maximized.  Just the same, it was tasty and so easy to prepare.  I'm keeping this one! Thanks Ruthie!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written. This should be called Way Way Beyond Unbelievable Chicken! People inhaled this. No leftovers. Will have to make it again soon because people keep asking for it. This will certainly become something I cook regularly. Thank you LETSGGGO for this perfect and delish recipe.

A moist and tasty marinade!  I can't say enough about this recipe other than it's a 10!  I doubled the recipe and kept half of the marinade for a basting sauce while grilling.  I didn't have brown sugar so I substituted cup of white sugar and 3 tbsp of molasses.  I used canola oil instead of olive oil and that also worked just fine.  This marinade worked well for pork chops too.  Definitely a keeper.

My family eats so much chicken that my husband says that we are going to start "clucking".  Along comes this recipe, and in a constant quest to find news ideas to cook chicken, I tried it.  WOW!  I didn't make much because they are always saying they are so sick of chicken, but with this, they wanted to know why I didn't make more!  It was truly fantastic!  I even used regular yellow mustard because I didn't have the grainy kind, and it was still great.  It probably would have a great kick if you used Dijon mustard, too!  I will have to try that the next time.  Thanks, Ruthie!

I joined this site to specifically say that this recipe is idiot proof.  And I am the idiot to prove it.  I'm a good cook, usually follow recipes (the first time), but this one I screwed up so much and it still came out FABULOUS.

I read a lot of the reviews (not all 1,200), and none mentioned grilling skin-on, mixed chicken pieces.  Well, that is what we do in the summer.  So understanding that...

I made the marinade.  Cider vinegar, brown sugar, garlic (powder - I don't like the burning pieces of garlic on the grill), olive oil, 1/2 a lemon's juice (I only had the dreaded bottled lemon juice), half a lime (I only had, even WORSE, Rose's sweetened lime juice).

Put in the 2 pieces of chicken, with skin.  Only 2 pieces of chicken because with all my other marinades I just boil up the marinade as a sauce.

I go back to the website to see if anyone boils their marinade, and people keep talking about "mustard".  MUSTARD????  What mustard?  I totally spaced on the mustard.

Out comes the pan from the fridge, in goes the whole grain mustard (which is not that hard to find, I use Maille Old Style).

8 hours later, time to grill.

Since I was afraid of flare-ups (sugar and oil), I scrape almost all the marinade off the chicken, pour it all into a pan.  Boil for 5+ minutes (if you boil for 5 minutes, you get rid of the chicken "problem").

Husband grills chicken (no flare ups), add the reduced sauce at the table, and it is FABULOUS.

Even with screwups- just delicious. A keeper.

I just tried this recipe and I've decided it is my new go to marinade. This is awesome and would go perfect with a Ceasar salad and garlic bread.  The only thing I did different was the mustard I didn't have the mustard it called for so I used prepared yellow mustard 3 tbsp and 1 tsp of dry ground mustard. Beautiful!!! Plus my husband is an amazing barbecuer.

Fabulous recipe!!!  We made shish-ka-bobs and I marinated the chicken in this sauce.  I boiled the remaining sauce and used it to baste the ka-bobs when they were on the grill.  And we also used it on our plates to dip the chicken in.  Future thoughts for this - once you boil the marinade, it thickens up; I'll be using it as a spread on turkey sandwiches!  Yummy!

Unbelievable is a good word for this.  We loved it.  The chicken is slightly sweet, but still has some bite to it.  I will make again for sure.

Excellent marinade!! Since I only made 4 chicken breasts, I cut back on a few of the ingredients.  I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 3...1/4 c. brown sugar instead of 1/2....2 tablespoons coarse mustard instead of 3. I marinated the chicken for 5 hours and it was fabulous. Hubby had seconds and said that this was our "chicken marinade" from now on... thanks Ruthie for a great recipe I will use over and over!!

So good! I gotta say I was missing some ingredients, I didn't have cider vinegar and lime, so I used white vinegar and used more lemon. I wanted a quick dinner so only marinated 2 chicken breast for hour and half, and since I dont have a griller I put the chicken into a pan and I added all the sauce, and I gotta say it was delicious! Couldn't stop sucking my fingers while eating! Im so cooking this again!

I think this is called unbelievable because when you are mixing it up, it's hard to believe that it will taste so good.  IT DOES!!  I had to use spicy brown mustard out of necessity and also did not use as much olive oil. My picky eating 5 year old loved it.  He called it "sweet-sweet chicken".  This is going to be a regular in our house!! UPDATE**I doubled the marinade recipe tonight and my husband cooked some of it on the stovetop to reduce it to a sauce. We put it over the chicken and some rice.  DELICIOUS.

What is unbelievable about this recipe is how the simple ingredients come together for such an excellent flavor.  The whole family loved it and my husband & I looked at each other and said "crushed red pepper flakes".  I just happened to have both fresh lemon and lime juice and I really think that it makes a big difference.  I used French's spicy brown - it was in the fridge - and was generous with the garlic too.  Tonight I'm trying it with boneless pork chops.

EXCELLANT FLAVOR.  Grilled legs and thighs with the bone and skin on, indirect and slow on our Webber charcoal grill. A moist stickly glaze formed and was raved over by all ages when served for a family birthday dinner. We definately be serving this chicken again.

This chicken really is unbelievably good! I mixed all the ingredients together, using regular french's mustard by the way, and thought "hmmm, it smells odd". We grilled in the next day, let it marinate about 16 hours and let me tell you, it was absolutely delicious. I am making this for the 2nd time tomorrow, I just finished making the marinade and placing the chicken in it and putting in the fridge. This time I sliced the chicken thinner so that we could get even more of the marinade's flavor. It's delicious. I highly recommend this.

Delicious!  My boys were complaining that there wasn't enough chicken to go around.  They each had two pieces, for Pete's sake!  Only marinaded for 2 hrs since I didn't have the 8 and there was still a great flavor.  Will definitely double next time!

My family loved it! I did end up marinating it for two days and the flavor was a still a bit subtle. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will reserve some marinade and brush it on the chicken while it cooks. If you want more heat perhaps add some hot sauce to the marinade?

Excellent taste! At first I wasn't sure about how this recipe would come out. After marinating it overnight, then cooked, the taste was heaven! Next time I made it I will add some peppers to add some spicy kick. But after all, nice recipe!

This was a decent marinade makes alot. I did the chicken on the George Foreman Grill to save time. All the acids helped tenderize the chicken nicely. I was hoping the brown sugar would carmelize better than it did.

My family loved this! Made a double portion and ate it on sandwiches the next day.  Will make again.  Loved the tangy and slightly sweet taste.  I was instructed to make this again soonish.  Didn't alter recipe, it didn't need too.  I cooked it in some of the marinate on the stove top.  Yummy!  Thasnks for sharing Letsgggo.

The name says it all....unbelievable tasting chicken!  I subbed Dijon mustard for the coarse grained and used bottled lime and lemon juice instead of fresh.  I only had time to marinate it for 5 hours instead of the full 8, but it was totally delish anyways!  Thank you, thank you for posting this yummy recipe! :)

As a contest winner of a contest that was on the RE, my prize was an AR family favorites cookbook. For my first recipe to cook out of it, I chose quite by random draw this recipe,  and it did not disappoint. I made it exactly as written except instead of the course grained mustard, I happen to have a sweet onion and smokey bacon mustard that I thought would be really good with the rest of the ingredients. I also cut the brown sugar by half and used 1/4 C. This was plenty sweet enough. I was not unhappy at all. I loved the contrast of the sweet, tart, smokey, garlicky flavors. Served with Herb roasted Greek potatoes from this site and a green salad. Wonderful summertime easy dinner. Will make again for sure.

A wonderful taste for summer and a very flavorful way to grill chicken.  (Because of the sugar, be sure to oil your grates prior so it doesn't stick!)  This was a hit with my family (teens too) and I plan to keep it in rotation for the outdoor grilling season.

I really struggled over whether to rate this a 4 or 5, but 5 won out!  It really is very good.  I used dijon mustard and only 4 Tbsp of oil.  I don't keep fresh lemons and limes on hand, so I used 1 Tbsp lime juice and 1 tsp lemon juice.  The flavors all blended together nicely and I enjoyed the slightly sweet taste from the brown sugar.  It's a keeper for sure!

What a great marinade! The whole family loved the chicken we made for dinner tonight. Made only a couple of changes - didn't have the brown mustard, so used yellow, but just 2 tbsp, and was out of lemons, so used just the lime juice. My very picky 10-year-old son said, "whoever made up this recipe rocks!"  I Whisked together the marinade and poured over tenders in a gal. zip lock  bag this morning, so marinated about 10 hours. Will use exact recipe next time. Used chicken tenders and my husband cooked them slowly on the grill. VERY juicy and full of flavor.Thanks, Ruthie!

Very very good. Had a few friends round and all were impressed. Heated the marinade in a pan after removing chicken (simmered to ensure it was safe to eat) and then used it as a sauce. Went down a treat, served with roast potatoes and roast vegetables. Thank you.

This was a very good marinade. Next time I will add more lemon and lime juice and marinade the chicken all day like the recipe recommends. I thought I could get away with marinating the chicken for just a few hours, but it was not enough time. This would also be great on veggies.

My husband went nuts over this marinade. He couldn't stop complimenting about how good it tasted. I cooked the chicken on low heat and spent a lot of time basting it. It was juicy and had a really great flavor - different. I highly recommend this recipe.

this was the best chicken marinade I have ever had. You can actually tast the marinade on the chicken even after grilling. I even ate it 2 days later and still the flavor was there.

Excellent flavor!  Marinated over-night.  Used a little less brown sugar; otherwise, wouldn't change a thing...yum!

Easy, excellent marinade. Used Dijon mustard, all the rest was as stated. Only marinated about 2 hrs, so I left a little on the side to drizzle over the top. This was a great suggestion by a previous reviewer! My bro suggested to make extra as a salad dressing, and use the leftover grilled chicken in a salad which is also brilliant. Thanks for this easy & tasty recipe!

This marinade it UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!  I followed it exactly and marinaded my chicken for 24 hours.  I decided to added a little pure maple syrup and it was a total hit!  We had friends over and the kids LOVED it as much as the adults (kids are 2 and 5).  This will be my go to marinade for BBQs moving forward!  Already shared the recipe with my friend.

This was yummy - I used boneless,skinless thighs and then grilled them. I marinated them overnight. I think next time I'll marinated them for 2 nights for deeper flavor - will be making again.

Made exactly as written except for using chicken breasts.  I cut up a whole chicken and used that instead.  I made up a bunch of quick week-night dinners and froze them.  Actually I had to go back into my "Recipe Box" and figure out which marinade this was as I had marinaded a bunch of meat in different marinades and put them in the freezer.  Glad I figured it out as it was quite tasty.  Definitely unusual but in a good way.  Nice to have a marinade that was different from the rest.  I will make this again.

I've used this recipe twice.  The first with whole boneless breasts and the 2nd time with strips. I bought the strips by accident, and I liked them better.  Poking them with a fork 1st all over, and marinading them for about 24 hours.  We grilled them on tin foil first and then on the grill grates to sear them. Finished they were so moist and tender. They were great. I've been sending all my friends this link!

Absolutely delicious! Because I typically use chicken tenders rather than breasts, mine turned out just a smidge too sweet. Next time I'll adjust the brown sugar but that's the only change and I'll make it only to accommodate the cut of chicken I like to use. We just loved this! :o)

Pretty good but had to substitute limeade for the lime juice and prepared mustard for the ground.  I think it will be better when I have the correct ingredients but definitely was not disappointed!

This was really good and very moist.  I probably didn't add enough salt to my marinade and next time will cut the brown sugar in half because it was a little too sweet for us.  That being said, we reheated the leftovers the next day to serve with chinese chicken salad and it was awesome!

Excellent flavor, tender and moist. Cold leftovers are even great. Didn't have coarse mustard, just used ground, no problems and didn't have an overly powerful mustard taste. Might try poking the chicken with a fork next time to get some of the flavor into it deeper. Everyone loved it, this one is a keeper!

Fantastic! It has a sort of asian-inspired flavor. I used chicken tenderloins and they turned out great. Definitely marinade for the full time recommended. I took the remaining marinade and cooked it down to a thick sauce (cooking also kills any bacteria worries) and it made an excellent dip. I will definitely make this again- maybe even with beef next time!

Have made this recipe as written at least 3 times in the past 2 weeks.  Chicken was tender and flavorful even though it only marinated for 3 hours.  I save some of the freshly made marinade in the refrigerator and use it to baste the chicken while it's on the grill.  It always gets rave reviews!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great flavor.  I did use the oven b/c we were doing yardwork and I didn't have the time to monitor the grill.  I think I'd like them grilled even better.

It's called Carolina BBQ sauce when it's vinegar + mustard without tomatoes, folks.  With a lengthy marinade, it's just as good to use Coleman's mustard powder from the big can and a lot less expensive than prepared mustard.  I grill chicken maybe twice a week and this is one of the better ways.

Great recipe! The night before, I defrosted a whole bag of boneless skinless chicken tenderloins in the microwave, patted them dry, placed in a gallon size recloseable bag with a double recipe of the marinade. At grilling time, this is the critical step, grilled them for 3 mins each side on med high, set the timer as soon as they hit the grate (both sides), and wow! Talk about tender! My best grilled chicken in 30 years of grilling!

I only had an hour to marinate the chicken but I think it was long enough, it was delicious.  DH really raved over it.  I had fresh lemons but not limes so I had to use bottled lime juice.  And I used Dijon because that's what I had on hand.

This was good, but not as exciting as several reviews sounded. We were expecting more of a BANG! of flavor. Needs more garlic, maybe som fresh ginger and red pepper flakes. IT's not bad, just not 5 star.

Oh my goodness!  I'm not a big mustard fan (except for soft pretzels and hot dogs) and this marinade smelled questionable to me...but dang...this was AWESOME!  Even my kids who claimed they weren't hungry chowed down on this chicken.  VERY good!!!!

I love this recipe, the chicken came out really flavorful and tender.  I only made a few small changes.  I used dijon mustard because I have no idea what coarse ground mustard is.  I marinated the breasts in a ziplock bag for three hours (it's all the time I had) and cooked them in a nonstick skillet on the stovetop.  I used thin cut breasts so they cooked up fast, I think this is way easier than grilling outdoors.  Definitely a keeper.

This is our favorite way to make chicken - my only suggestion is to use garlic powder or granulated garlic, because the real thing tends to burn on the grill.  I also double the recipe - and we let it marinate overnight if possible so that all the goodness soaks in.  This is also really good on pork.

This is an awesome marinade. I've found that even after marinating chicken, it can still be a little bland after it's grilled and many times, it needs BBQ sauce. Not the case with this marinade. The chicken was delicious on its own! I didn't have time to marinate it for very long, but it was still way yummy.

I made this tonight for my  boyfriend, and he loved it. I cut the chicken in cubes, marinated from friday night until today (sunday).  Made kabobs with red, yellow, green peppers and baby portabella mushrooms, grilled until done.  Served it with jasmine rice and green beans.  The only change I made was to add a bit more brown sugar and tablespoon of honey. So tender and the flavor was deep into the chicken. Definitely a keeper!

Had no lime so I just used extra lemon juice and it was excellent!!!! I had bought some really grainy mustard as well I used a BBQ cipote mango chicken seasoning while grilling and constantly brushing the chicken with the marininade and that is what really made it great! I will definitely do this recipe again for a huge BBQ as it was so tender and perfect!

This was terrific!  I doubled the marinade for 12 bone-in thighs (I took the skin off).  Hy husband categorized the chicken as "tangy."  Served with plain rice and frozen corn.  Grilled the chicken for 10 minutes on high and then turned the chicken over and turned the temp down to medium for another 10 minutes.  It came out perfectly.  In the future, when doubling, I will probably use 1/3 cp vinegar and 2/3 cup brown sugar.  I mixed all ingredients in a ziploc bag and massaged until the ingredients were mixed then added the chicken.  I marinated for 2 days.  I'm not sure how necessary the lemon and lime are to the flavor - it had a terrific sweet hot mustard flavor.  Will make this again.  TY for sharing such a great recipe.

"Unbelievable" is a good word for this marinade.  EVERYONE loved it - especially me.  Chicken is usually so boring and this marinade gives it a terrific taste.  Husband hates mustard, so I just used about 2TSP of plain mustard out of the bottle instead of ground, and canola oil instead of olive oil.  It was scrumptious. BE PREPARED TO DOUBLE THE RECIPE ONLY BECAUSE IT'S SO DELICIOUS YOU'LL WISH YOU HAD MORE.  Post Script: I tried it again this week using RICE WINE VINEGAR.  Delicious. While it tastes good baked, be sure to put chicken under the brolier or on the grill as the cook says!

Can I give this 10 stars? Husband made this recipe using margarita mix (with the tequila) in place of lemon/lime only because it was on hand and a previous reviewer suggested it. He poked holes in chicken breasts with fork before adding to marinade. Flavor permeated the meat that way. (Marinated 6 hrs.)Thanks for this wonderful recipe and I do mean wonderful!

Awesome recipe.  Perfect combination of sweet and sour.  The olive also allowed the chicken to brown on the outside, which held in the juices.  Everyone loved it!

I think the 'secret' to this recipe is to use the freshest ingredients available. Don't make the mistake of using bottled lemon and lime juice! With that said, I doubled the marinade, let teh chicken sit in the marinade overnight in the fridge, then basted it over the chicken as it cooked. Next time I'll try tripling the recipe so I can make a dipping sauce out of some of it. Definitely give this a try - the chicken is very juicy, tender, and flavorful.

Very good!  I looked at this recipe for a long time before trying it... thinking it would be good, then having doubts for some reason.  Anyway, I'm happy to say it turned out better than I expected it to!  Great flavor!

This is truly a great marinade.  I made it for Fathers Day and everyone couldn't get enough of the chicken. I had to make copies of the receipe and give it out.

This recipe surprised me. It is really good! My suggestion is to marinate overnight/ 24 hours. After 7 hours, the flavor was good but could see room for improvement. Also, piercing the chicken may have helped to get the flavors more throughout. I always forget to do that. Even the kids liked it.

I can't say that there was anything 'unbelievable' with this.  It was good but I definitely expected more after an 8hr. marinate.  The amount of sugar made controlling grilling flare ups tricky.

This recipe was EXCELLENT! We absolutely loved it. It's very hard to find marinades that really soak into the chicken breast. This totally did and I was very happy. Livened up the chicken breast big time. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for submitting!

This is a fablous marinade.  The chicken is great the first day and even better warmed up the next day.  Very easy and a wonderful flavor.  I didn't have the whole grain mustard so I just used yellow mustard.

Loved it.  Making it again tonight.  Gives great flavor to boring chicken breasts. Didn't have a lime, so I used a whole lemon instead. It was bit better with the lime on the first try, but good with only lemon as well.

The flavour of this was outstanding. I dont have a lot of luck with chicken breasts however as I tend to overcook them. Next time i will flatten or halve them and cook for less time; perhaps with better luck.

Made it exactly as is.... It was really good... Think it needs a bit more salt. Think I would add a few tbs of soy sauce next time, or filet the chicken breast so that the flavors are better absorbed. This one is a keeper!

i don't like chicken, and i really liked this recipe.  fantastic with quinoa and the roasted brussel sprouts.
I used regular olive oil (too much) - next time try it with light olive oil.

Delicious!!!!  Made exactly as written.  Grilled 7 minutes on each side.  I saved a 1/2 cup of marinade prior to putting in the chicken.  I poured a little of the marinade over the chicken after grilling.

This is excellent.  Poked holes in the chicken with a fork...marinated overnight in a plastic bag...barbecued the next evening...and it was absolutely delicious.  The best chicken I've had...or made.

I prepared the marinade and wasn't able to cook it until the following evening. I did exactly what the directions called for. It was wonderful I ended up putting the chicken on top of a salad with balsamic vinager.  I will be making this again for sure!!! Thanks for sharing

Really great flavor.  I was worried it would be bland so I thickened the marinade on the stove for a dipping sauce but there is no need - the flavor is all the way through the chicken.  Nice recipe!

This chicken lived up to its name!  I made it according to the recipe with no alterations.  It tasted so much better than Cracker Barrel grilled chicken tenderloins.  I do cut my chicken breasts into smaller pieces, so it gets more marinade.  Regular chicken breasts just did not have enough of the yummy marinade stick to it.

Really enjoyed this chicken. I marinated for 2 days. I used less mustard as my spouse doesn't like mustard. I snuck it in there to my surprise absolutely loved it. We grilled it on the barbeque so delish. I could taste the mustard and was a perfect blend. Had to give up the secret ingredient but was asked to make this again.

I've made this several times, exactly as written. The latest time was to use in fajitas for 40 people. I lost track of how many times I had to give this recipe out. It is just fabulous! Moist & flavorful, it makes the perfect chicken!

Awesome marinade! Makes very versatile, juicy chicken. My mom did not care for the chicken due to the brown sugar in it, but the kids and I loved it!

I tried this recipe and found it too sweet for me.  It tasted like teriyaki chicken.  Maybe next time I'll leave out the brown sugar or reduce to a couple tablespoons max.

Had only chicken tenderloins and no lime, so used juice from whole lemon; otherwise followed recipe as written. Only marinated about 4 hours, but chicken was very moist and delicious.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the post.

I made this recipe as part of the hidden treasures blog by mis7up.  I have had this recipe in my box since July 2009.  This chicken was good but I wouldn’t call it unbelievably good.  I followed the recipe as written except I used my George Forman grill which I realize to some is cheating.  My family did enjoy this and I would use it as a marinade again.

Delicious. I halved the recipe, and made just a couple of changes. Instead of the salt I used Lawry's seasoned salt, and I left out the lime, since I didn't have one. I also added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, and 1/4 tsp paprika. I used 2 chicken breasts and sliced them (butterfly style) super thin so they would pick up the flavor better. The smell of this was really weird going together, but I gave it a chance anyways, since it could possibly be due to my pregnant smell sensitivities...I'm glad I did. I will be making this again and again! Thanks LETSGGGO!

Incredible marinade! The only change i made was I used spicy brown mustard. I marinated chicken tenders for 12 hours.  We loved the flavor and will definetely make this again.

Wow! This is unbelievable. I marinated 2 breasts and 4 thighs in this marinade today and my husband grilled them for dinner.  Stupendous! I did reduce the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and the salt to 1 tsp.  I also made another batch with even less sugar and salt to use as a salad dressing! Yummy!

Very moist and tasty.  Made exactly as written except for the mustard I used spicy brown mustard and I only marinated for 2 hours.  Longer would probably make it more flavorful.  Will make again.

Have made this many times since last July 4th when everyone raved about it and it was the first item requested for this July 4th. Did not change a thing and it turns out great every time.

Yum! The marinade smells a bit pungent but the chicken isn't too strongly flavored. It gets a lot of tang from the vinegar but I didn't taste the mustard at all- perhaps with a less mild mustard (I picked an apple mustard to coordinate with the cider vinegar) you'd get a stronger flavor. Either way, I liked it.
The wind kept blowing out the grill so I made this in the oven. I'd like to make it on the grill next time because I think it will caramelize really well. Even in the oven it was really good, and definitely a keeper.

This marinade was good, but I wouldn't quite call it "unbelievable". It tasted like a nice honey-mustard marinade. Some sweetness, a little salty and the mustard essence. Good, but I was not 'wow'-ed. Thanks for sharing!

YUM! I am impressed! I was nervous when I prepared the marinade because the smell of it was odd, but 10 hours later when I made it for dinner it turned out to be the most moist and flavorful chicken I have made on the grill. I wish I had made more! I will definately be making this again and sharing the recipe!

Really tasty.  For me, the cider vinegar was almost a bit too strong for chicken.  Seemed more like what I would expect on pork tenderloin.  Yet the family all said good and great.  It was a unique flavor and one I want to work with to make it just right for us.  I will try this  on pork tenderloin and increase mustard...maybe add Rosemary.

Not unbelievable, but pretty good and a nice change from our usual chicken marinades. I followed one of the top reviewers to bake it at 350 for about 40 minutes, halved the marinade and used about 1.3 lbs of chicken tenderloins. I liberally added red pepper flakes and onion powder, and about half as less brown sugar than needed. Made with brown rice, will make again. Thanks!

Now that grilling season is here, this is a good one. Nice flavor..mosit and juicy chicken. I flattened my chicken for even cooking and served with a nice big salad. Love the citrus with the brown sugar...

I was really dissapointed in this recipe.  I always make highly rated recipes, and this is the first one I try that I didn't like.  The vinegar is too strong, and it would need something more than brown sugar to balance it out, and the mustard just adds to the strength of the vinegar.  I made two breast halves, tasted it, and I would have the vinegar, if anything, but something is missing in this recipe, I just don't know what.

This was a good marinade.  I reduced the sugar by half and I still thought it was sweet-tasting.  I thought the lime was a tad overpowering and next time will reduce that a little bit.  We will make this again.  I served this with the Japanese zucchini and onion recipe from the site and it was a good combo.

I was only able to marinate this for about five hours, and it was still delicious.  The children loved it and my husband and I thought it had great flavor.  I will definitely make this over and over again.

This was really really good!  Even if one uses this as a "base" marinade, and decides to add barbecue sauce at the last minute, the marinade really adds a lot of flavor that goes deep into the chicken. This one is a keeper!  I am passing this recipe onto friends and family.

Thanks LETSGGGO for a great recipe.  I grill a lot of chicken, and am always looking for other recipes.  My general rule for marinades that call for lemon/lime - double the juice and add the zest.  This one is easy and the results are flavorful.

Really tasty!  I used one package of Costco boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into thin tenders.  Because there are only the two of us, I will scale down the marinade for 2 next time.  I halved it last night, but there was still a lot of marinade left.  I may try next time also to save off a tablespoon of marinade before adding the chicken just to drizzle a little over the chicken and rice at the end.  It takes only a few minutes to grill this.  This would be good chicken for a salad!

Good but not great...Used lime and lemon juice and marinated for about 20 hours(put in marinade b4 bedtime and grilled it for dinner the following day)...It was very juicy and had a strong mustard taste.  Would probably make again, but not in our weekly rotation! Thanks for sharing!

This was terrific. I marinated them over night and everyone loved them. I think in the future though I will turn these into kabobs so you can get even more of the flavor of the marinade.

Just so-so. I had to use dijon mustard instead of ground(didn't have enough). I thought it was too mustardy and my husband thought it was too lemon/lime. May try it again when we can grill it.

Great recipe! I cubed chicken breast tenderloins before adding them to the marinade, then make kabobs out of them with some red & green bell pepper, sweet onion and pineapple and threw them on the grill. The chicken was great, even though it only got to marinade for a few hours. Next time will make it the night before as I'm sure it'll be even better! Thanks for sharing.

I've been looking for "the perfect marinade" for chicken kabobs and found this.  It doesn't say it is for kabobs but it was WONDERFUL on my chicken kabobs I made with chicken, mushrooms, bell peppers, zucchini and yellow squash.  This will be a favorite mainstay for a long, long time.  Thank you!

We thought this was just okay.  The flavors for me didn't mesh together that well and were very understated.  Thanks for the recipe, though I'll continue to look for another marinade.

I make this chicken 3 or 4 times per month!  I just love it!!  I typically don't use all of the olive oil, and I always cut the chicken breasts into cubes prior to marinating.  Marinate the cubes 4 to 5 hours, thread them onto skewers, boil the marinade to use for basting, and grill away!  The only problem I have ever had with this recipe is not making enough!

The only thing I did differently was cooking the chicken in a skillet instead of on the BBQ. I also only marinated the chicken for an hour. It still tasted great. My husband wasn't as into it as I was. I'd definitely make it again, only marinating it over night the next time.

My husband is a big fan of boneless chicken breasts because he is always dieting and trying to eat healthy.  I alwasy dread eating boneless chicken breasts because they are so boring and dry.  I made this recipe exactly as written and I can see why it is so highly rated.  It was fantastic!!!!  I kept joking with my husband and son that we were having "Unbelievable chicken" for dinner.  MY husband took one bite and said "It's unbelievable"  Try this one; you will not be disappointed.

Nope this is pretty believable.  It was okay, not great.  I have found other marinades that are better.  Won't make again.

YUMMM!  This chicken was really good!  I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make again.  One thing to mention though...I did cut each chicken breast into thirds to allow more surface area to marinade...it was perfect!

I wrote this recipe down sometime last year and then could not find it on this site again. I am so glad I've found it! This marinated chicken goes great in enchiladas. This is the best chicken marinade I have ever tried. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

An great but simple marinade I've made many times!  Thought it was just a touch on the sweet side the first time so I've tried slightly less brown sugar.  Great either way depending on preference.  First time I marinated overnight and it was tasty.  Second time I marinated only 1 1/2 hour but pierced the chicken with a fork to help the marinade soak through.  Make sure to reserve some of the marinade for basting!  Chicken is also great pan fried.

Sorry, but this marinate is horrid!  Made this recipe yesterday morning, marinated chicken breasts deboned and skinned in it all day.  Grilled last evening, and my husband and I thought it was probably the worst ever tried.  Our dog wouldn't even eat it?  Taking this mess out of my recipe box.

We used this recipe for graduation night, because we didn't have time to make the whole chickens we usually make.  My husband was wary about making something 'new' for guests, but this chicken was wonderful.  Everyone loved it and it was easy to cook.  I used whole chicken pieces with the skin so it took longer, but it was terrific. And I liked the dark meat the best, but the white meat was tender and juicy too.

Delicious.  I kept the ingredients the same however I baked it at 400 degrees for 40 mins.  I dumped the chicken and the marinade into a casserole dish.  I baked it covered for 25 mins and then uncovered for 15 mins. I will totally make this again

Marinade isn't versatile enough. We cooked it in the oven, and the flavor was not to our liking. Because of the high reviews, I'm assuming grilling makes a world of difference, but in my opinion a solid marinade should be able to be baked as well.

This recipe is awesome. I've made it several times and my favorite was when I made it with 2 tbs honey mustard and 1tbs of dijon. The other times I have just made it with dijon. This is my favorite chicken marinade I have tried. I've cooked the chicken on the grill (best) and on the stove top. Both are good.

I love this marinade for chicken - I recommend using all of the vegetables listed - do not substitute for powder/etc as the freshness of the lemon and lime give it a real kick! I found that using mustard instead of ground mustard (if you don't have it) still gives it the same taste. After marinating - I use this on the george foreman grill. Thank you for the recipe! Highly recommend!

This was AMAZING!!! I hate chicken and the husband always dips chicken in something.  We devoured this with no dip. We are on weight watchers and for 7 points serving, this will be in our rotation!! Yum. I changed nothing and marinated for twenty hours.

I usually choose a recipe based off of ratings, which was why I tried this one over the weekend. I really didn't care for it and was disappointed. The marinade was just way too sweet to me. I love sweets but apparently not with chicken. The brown sugar was just far too noticeable to me & the flavor just seemed off. I made it for a family party and the others referred to it as sugar chicken so apparently it was noticeable to them  as well

Honestly, just "ok", definitely a good basic recipe though.  Next time, i think I'll kick it up with some red pepper , more garlic, and reduce the sugar.  Might cut up the chicken breast and use fur and use for skewers too. I think that would work better than leaving them as whole breasts.  My boyfriend liked it, but my 11 year old thought it was to sweet. I followed the recipe to the T and let the chicken breasts marinate about 10 hours before grilling.  Served with rice and roasted bell pepper and onion.

I made this tonight for my family - three teenage boys, two 10 year old girls and my husband. I made some on the grill and some of my George Foreman. Both were awesome, and with this crowd we have several different tastes and a couple very picky eaters. Everyone loved this. The only change I made was using Dijon for the mustard. Will definitely make again and again.

This was so good! I scaled it down for 2 big chicken breast and I had to replace the ground mustard with yellow mustard (it was all I had) but I kept everything else the same. It was slightly sweet and had a little "oomph" to it from the  vinegar. Will definitely make this again

My boyfriend loved this chicken. I've made it a couple of times. We are garlic lovers so I added a little extra garlic and a little less oil.

I followed the recipe exactly. I served this chicken at my 40th birthday party (Nov., 2013) and my guest are still asking for the recipe. Over 100 people and they loved the chicken.  It was so tender, moist, and flavorful!

It smelled good, but the taste was definitely lacking something.  I also just read through some reviews and saw one that stated the lemon and lime juice make the chicken tough.  I'm thinking that may be an accurate observation.  The chicken was not juicy at all.  For as long as this was marinating, it should've been more tender.  We each desperately grabbed some bottled sauce (A1, sweet and sour) to douse our individual pieces, just to add some flavor and moistness.

Quick and easy marinade.  Only had an hour to marinade the chicken before I grilled it so I kept dipping the chicken in the marinade as it cooked.  Served this with roasted veggies and brown rice (pine nuts, shallots, edamame and a light cilantro lime dressing).   Healthy, clean and easy.....great combination!  Thank you!

Very tasty! I pounded out the chicken beforehand because I didn't have a full 8 hours and I made it in the oven under the broiler, pouring the collected juices over the chicken afterward. My timing was off with sides so I put the chicken and juices under foil and in a warmed oven for about a half hour before eating. It was super tasty and moist - will definitely make again!

It took a lot more than 8 minutes per side, but I think that depends entirely on the size of your breasts. I had a feeling this would be the case and that the chicken would be a little dry as a result, so I drained all the marinade into a saucepan and added a little cornstarch mixed with water. After it came to a boil, I took it down to low until the chicken was ready.  What a WONDERFUL sauce! I would never make this again without it!

This is by far the best marinade I have ever tried!  My entire family LOVED it!  We need to make more chicken next time as even my 2 y/o was eating it like crazy. We were all looking for more.  The greatest part of the marinade is the brown sugar.  It is so Yummy!

So juicy and delicious! I added some cumin to the marinade. After grilling, I sliced up the chicken and used for soft tacos. I agree with other reviewers that this also makes great chicken salad.

This is the first review I've written on this site. I've been waiting for a recipe that was so amazing I had to write something. This is it. I just made it for my whole extended family, didn't change a thing except to 1.5x the recipe and use boneless chicken thighs and it was by far the very best grilled chicken I have ever had. The chicken is so juicy!The flavour is incredible. It's really the mustard that gives it some texture so don't use anything but a coarse grainy mustard. All of the flavours work so well together. Everyone thought it was amazing and asked that I make it whenever we get together. Done!

Made this with six boy scouts on a recent camping trip.   Four of the boys made the recipe as written & two added some of their favorite seasonings such as red pepper flakes, they all used a combo of boneless, skinless breasts & thighs, cooked on a charcoal grill.  The boys from the other patrols were quite jealous and not as happy with the hot dogs and hamburgers they cooked.  As all meals are to be made by the boys it was a pleasure to have them serve me this delicious dish.  The marinade was easy enough even for the younger guys to prepare and cooking time got these hungry boys fed quickly.  They were all proud of what they cooked and raved about the taste......Sweetroll

I made this marinade yesterday (I'd saved it in my recipes since January, I wanted to try it) and followed the recipe as it was given, except for the lime. I only had lemons on hand, so I just improvised with that. This was outstanding! My fiancé usually will only eat maybe one chicken breast but with this marinade he ate two and kept saying how good they were! This is a keeper!

Great flavor.  Boyfriend loved it.  All he kept talking about after dinner was how much he was looking forward to taking the leftovers to work the next day!  A real hit.

I didn't marinate this as long as I should have and it still came out delish!! Next time, I will double the sauce, reduce halve, and use it as a dipping suave after the chicken is cooked. Perfect!

Phenomenal marinade.  I love that the ingredients are usually items that I always have on hand (except the fresh citrus, which is a must in this recipe).  It smelled so great coming off the grill and was super moist and tasted great!.

This was a decent marinade, but for me, it was missing something. I like things a little more spicy, so perhaps that was it. This would be really good for kabobs!

Made this marinade as written. Delicious. I made a quadruple batch and marinaded 6 chicken breasts (cut into bite-sized pieces) for almost 24 hours in approx 1/4 of the marinade (equivalent to this recipe, as written) and approx a dozen large shrimp for 15 min. Refrigerated the reserved 3/4 of the marinade. The next night we grilled the chicken, shrimp, and added pineapple chunks, onions, and red peppers. Served with rice. Heated the reserved half of the marinade and served individually for each person to use as dip or to pour over meat, veggies and rice.  Everyone loved it!  Definitely 5 stars. Will make again and again!
Have made this recipe numerous times. Most recently started marinating bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts before grilling.  Everyone raves about them. Very moist and juicy plus a wonderful flavor!  Can't say enough good about this recipe!!!

This was pretty good.  Followed the recipe other than having to use honey mustard instead of coarse ground and I only used 2 tbs b/c I didn't want it to be over powering.  It was too salty for our taste though so I would cut down to 1 tsp or even 3/4 tsp. salt.  We are not huge mustard fans so I don't think it will be a staple but it is good for once in a while.

This marinade make chicken so scrumptious! It is also very versatile. While we love chicken grilled after being marinaded in it, my favorite it to pour this marinade over six frozen chicken breasts and cook in the crock pot on high for 4 hrs. The chicken is so tender and served over rice it is something like a sweet and sour chicken dish! Absolutely wonderful!!  The only "changes" I make is to put Dijon mustard in instead of the prepared coarse mustard.

We loved this! I've never used a marinade that really made such a difference to the flavor of the meat throughout. Used regular mustard, 1/2 cup lime juice, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/2 cup (3 T = 1/4 cup) olive oil. I'm going to bake this when grilling season is over, and going to try on a roasted whole fryer, as well!

I'm usually leery of recipes with lofty goals in the title, however, this one really is unbelievable.  Followed the recipe exactly as written with one exception.  I have no grill, so pan seared and then baked in oven to cook through.  I didn't think it was even possible to have juicy boneless, skinless chicken.  But it is, and this one nails it!

I did not have the lime juice or the course ground mustard--I did use ground mustard in it's place. I thought it turned out pretty darn good. Worth a try, the charred crust on mine was tantalizing!!!

I really like this marinade, but I just had to add a bit of powdered chipotle for a little kick.  It rained so I cooked them in the oven on a raised rack and basted a couple times with the marinade.  I used boneless thighs...so much more flavor than the every day breast!  Turned out great, and nice to have another marinade under the belt, so to speak!

This is a good, solid recipe.  Since I had 5 breasts, I used the full amount everything except oil (used 5 tablespoons of oil). I marinated for about 8 hours and it could have gone for a full 24 hrs.  Next time I'll try that.  No need to mix in a different bowl - I just threw everything into a ziploc bag and mixed there.  Served with a fresh lettuce salad and noodles.  Will have again.

I think this this chicken is awesome.  I barely changed the recipe at all with the exception of fresh garlic.  I did not have time to marinade the chicken so I put it in a glass dish and baked it with the sauce.  It was delicious.  I will make sure I have enough time to marinade it next time and there will be a next time.  I thought it was 5 stars, my husband thought it was too sweet for him and rated it a 3.  Therefore I believe this is a good 4 star recipe.  Enjoy.  :-)

This is the BEST chicken marinade I have ever tried!!  I made this and put it on top of a garden salad.  Moist, flavorful and tender.  I did pound my chicken to about 1/2 inch thick before marinating, then grilled over charcoal.  Thanks for sharing!

Really great flavor.  I used Honey Dijon Mustard instead of the course ground.  I also left a little marinade on the side to drizzle on the chicken close to finish.  I may try this as a salad dressing soon.  I will be making this again, for sure.  Great tasting, fast and easy recipe.

Very nice chicken.  Makes a lot of marinade, so maybe I'd cut it back next time.  The chicken turns out slightly tangy and sweet, so it's not too strong of a flavor.  Bf isn't a fan of mustard or vinegar, so he was able to tolerate this bc it was still mild.  Thanks for the recipe!

Moist, flavorful, delicious. Anything my picky 10 year old asks for seconds on is a keeper. Followed the recipe exactly.

This is so great.  I used chicken thighs.  I didn't have time to marinate, so I mixed up a double batch of the sauce and poured it over the thighs and put them directly in the oven for 1.5 hrs at 325.  (I like the skin crispy).  DON"T use the olive oil because the thighs have tons of skin.  I only had regular mustard but it tasted fantastic.  It was more moist than the chicken breasts and the extra sauce tasted amazing on the side dish noodles.

We've made several times.  Follow recipe exactly.  We've grilled and broiled the chicken.  Both times chicken breast very juicy.  We take leftover chicken and add mayo and use our ninja blender and make a creamy chicken salad.  Now that's really tasty!

Wow!  I followed this recipe to a T and it was sooooo good!  My husband loved it, as well as my picky kids!  The one thing I wish I would have done was either saved some of the marinade for dipping, or injected it in the chicken!  Very very good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I loved it!! Followed exactly.   Grilled a few breasts and dice up for topping on salads for lunch through the week - the diced chicken goes with all salad dressings (and without).  GREAT recipe, thanks for sharing.

Unbelievable is right! I was surprised at how tasty and delicious this chicken was! I had to make a couple of changes because of what I had on hand. I used bottled juice, 2 TB lime, 1-1/2 TB lemon. Also, I only had honey mustard in the fridge so went with 3 TB of that. I pounded out my chicken breasts a little before putting them in the marinade in the morning.  We grilled them over a charcoal grill that evening and the result was so good! I'll definitely make this again, and also plan to try with the coarse ground mustard, maybe some time with dijon mustard. This combo of ingredients is definitely a 5 star recipe.

i am trying to follow the hcg diet.  having to avoid sugar, i omitted the brown sugar and substituted 2 T of stevia, which is allowed.  olive oil is also a no no, so i omitted that too.  after searching "ingredients" this recipe popped up, using the cider vinegar and lemon - 2 very important ingredients on the hcg diet. i cut the breasts into kabobs, marinated for only and hour (it took so long to find a recipe) and grilled them and they turned out great.  i'm sure brown sugar would have been much better, but it worked fine, minus the calories.  i can't wait to make it again.  thanks for sharing.

This is my very favorite marinade for chicken. We eat chicken with this marinade more then any other way. Just make sure you don't let it marianate for more then 8 hours or the vinegar and citrus juices start to "cook" the chicken.

I cut the olive oil to 3 TB and only let it marinade for 1 hour as that is all the time I had.  The taste was delicious.

This was a great, simple marinade.  I only had time to marinade about 2-3 hours, but I think the chicken still turned out great.  Good, subtle flavors and juicy chicken.

Meh. This was allright. It's surprising to see that this recipe has received so many five star reviews. This is not unbelievable by any means (sorry!). I made this a night early so that my hubby and I could have a quick weeknight dinner the next day. I caught a stomach bug and went straight to bed when I got home from work, so we did not have dinner as planned. My chicken sat in its marinade for well over 24 hours, but was still SUPER bland! It was also slightly dry, but that could be because the acidic lemon / lime juice and cider vinegar "cooked" my meat (that's why you should not marinate for more than 24 hours). This is an easy fix, but I don't know how to remedy the blandness issue. Served with garlic herb red potatoes and grilled corn on the cobb. No surprise, the sides were the best part of our meal. Thanks anyways, LETSGGGO. :)

This marinade truly is unbelievable! Excellent flavour, very tender meat! Next time I am going to do what another reviewer recommended: butterfly the chicken breast so that more surface area can marinate, because more of this marinade can only be a good thing!

WOW!  All I can say is that I wanted to drink this marinade it was sooo good.  I inadvertantly forgot to add the lemon juice, but it was great anyway.  I was only to marinade for 7 hours and it was still infused with flavor.  Excellent recipe - my new favorite!

I had fairly low expectations, especially since I was only able to marinade for about an hour, but this was delicious. I pounded the chicken very thin and poked holes in it to get the flavors in, used yellow mustard and key limes rather than limes. I broiled it after realizing we were out of charcoal and it turned out very well (I basted a lot). I only used two large breasts and there was barely enough marinade to baste repeatedly so I might make more marinade in the future.

YUUUUUUMMMMMOOOOOOO  Was skeptical of just how good this would be but followed receipe except used veg oil and half the amount.  Used just a little margarine(butter would burn and don't like taste or feel of any oil)about 1 1/2 tbs in a heavy skillet on med high heat until browned on each side.  With the brown sugar this happens rather quickly so keep an eye on it.  Then turned heat down to low/covered and let cook about 25 mins turning half way through.  I used skinless boneless chicken breast.  Have to say I passed up the homemade mac/cheese to finish my piece of chicken and for once didn't share with the cat.  Try this you won't regret it.  One last thing I am betting these would be off the charts on a grill.

Made this tonight and my husband and I both raved about it.  We only had about 4-5 hours to marinade but I sliced the breasts thinner and it turned out fantastic.  The grilled chicken can also be cut up and tossed in a salad for a very healthy dinner.  Super easy, taste explosion, will definitely be a staple in our home.

Delish.  I used canola oil because I didn't have any olive oil on hand and it came out just fine.  Very juicy and tasty.  Make extras to take for lunch as leftovers.

This really is unbelievable.  It's juicy and flavorful.  I used it for chicken kabobs, with little pieces of marinated chicken, and red and green peppers, and served it over cilantro lime rice.  Perfect!

wow, i was quite impressed with how amazing this was. i let it marinate for about 2 days and the fam couldn't believe how delicious it was. lives up to its name. also, i did deviate slightly from the recipe by adding about 1/4 cup of soy sauce which i highly suggest.

I noticed at the last minute that I didn't have cider vinegar. (You should have heard me curse.) So, I subbed balsamic. Because I'm cutting back on calories and my sugar intake, I used 1/4 c. Splenda brown sugar blend in place for the regular brown sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp. basil at the last minute. I thought that the 1 1/2 tsp. of salt was a little excessive, so I cut that down to just a dash or so. I only have a charcoal grill so I didn't want to cook this over the charcoal and have the flavor overtake the marinade so I baked the chicken in the oven. The smell was amazing and the chicken was so flavorful and moist. Went really well with the Garlic Pasta (made from jerusalem artichoke flour!), sauteed basil bella mushrooms and a veggie platter with low calorie dressing. I didn't feel deprived at all.  NOTE: I didn't have fresh lime or lemon juice so I took advice from someone at the Recipe Exchange and used 1/4 c. bottled lime juice and just under 1/4 c. bottled lemon juice. I also thought that using 1/4 c. of the Brown Sugar Spenda was a little too much. I might even cut that in half next time. And you know, even with my minor adjustments, it was really freaking good. This is SO a keeper. Even with my messing up and realizing at the last minute that I didn't have cider vinegar.

This is the best chicken marinade I have ever used. It is so tasty, and the chicken turns out so moist. I just realized that when I made it I left out the vinegar accidentally.....still fantastic!   Thanks for submitting it.

This marinade adds good flavor to the chicken breasts.  I altered the recipe by using the marinade for 3 chicken breasts, cutting the salt in half (Lawry's seasoning salt), added 2 tablespoons of honey and 2.5 tablespoons of dijon mustard (only because I ran out!).  Next time, I will cut the olive oil in half.  I marinaded the chicken for 2 days then baked it covered with foil at 350 degrees for 40 mins.  This recipe will definitely be added into my rotation.  Some reviewers who think this marinade is too sweet may be packing in the brown sugar when measuring.  The marinade tastes fine sweeter but the sugar overpowers the other more subtle flavors like the citrus, garlic etc.

This is a DELICIOUS marinade!  My whole family of 5 absolutely LOVED the chicken and couldn't get enough... and I have some picky kids.  They have asked me to make this again - yippee!!  I think I put the chicken in the marinade in the morning before work, and cooked it that evening.  The chicken was truly full of flavor.  We served it with Edamame and whole-wheat dinner rolls, but will serve it with rice next time. Thank you!

Great flavor and easy to throw everything in a bag to marinate.  I marinated with white wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  I also used 4 frozen chicken breasts and let them sit in a large zip bag for 10 hours in the fridge.  Even my picky 5 year old ate it!

Truly a delight!!! This was awesome and required the use of simple ingredients I already had laying around the houe. Nice flavor. The 2nd time I made it I added 1 orange to the marinade to enhance the citrus flavor and cayenne pepper. My family just loves this. Note: you can also substitute brown mustard or dijon for the prepared mustard and it still works out great.

delicious chicken marinade!  the perfect combo of savory/sweet.  utilizing my Food Saver, I pre-portion Food Saver bags with 2 or 3 chicken breasts, pour in some marinade, freeze, and then vacuum seal (you have to freeze first or the vacuum sealing process will suck out all the liquid!).  then I have pre-marinated frozen chicken breasts ready for a quick defrost and grill on a busy weeknight!  great with basmati rice.

This was very easy to put together and everyone seemed to like it.  Much better than anything you would get in a bottle with all those preservatives.  It's nice to have a go-to marinade that's made with common ingredients that I would probably have on hand.

This is the best 'homemade' chicken marinade I've ever had. Thank you for sharing the recipe! The first time I made it, I halved the recipe as I was only cooking two chicken breasts. After tasting the results, I vowed to make the full recipe from now on, and use the leftover chicken sliced up on salads, or for snacking, so I could continue to enjoy it for days - it's THAT GOOD! I reserved some of the marinade (before adding the raw chicken) for basting on the grill, and this time will reserve a second little bit (maybe a T or two) for drizzling on the top. This would also make great kabobs/skewers - marinating veggies in with the chicken would give you even MORE of an opportunity to tast the concoction! Just can't say enough.

Gave it a 3.  Actually ended up in the marinade for an extra 24 hours.  It has a nice taste, but nothing really special, think you could get the same effect with any store bought marinade.

OMG!  OMG!  OMG!  I CUT CHICKEN INTO CHUNKS AND MADE KABOBS.  I THOUGHT I HAD MADE ENOUGH FOR TWO NIGHTS, BUT I WAS SADLY MISTAKEN.  MY HUSBAND AND MY FOUR CHILDREN REQUESTED I DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.  SO I HAD NO CHOICE.  THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE WAY TO MAKE CHICKEN.  THANKS FOR SHARING.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! My husband asked when I was going to make it again.  I followed the recipe as far as ingredients were concerned, but I baked the chicken in the marinade instead of grilling it.  It was moist & FLAVORFUL!!!  I highly recommend this recipe!!

Yummy! I made the recipe as stated with 2 exceptions...I didn't have a lime and I used Splenda brown sugar blend. I was only able to let it marinade for 2 hours, but I used 'chicken strip' sized breasts and it seemed ample time.  It was really, really good. I served it with Peanut Sauce I from this site...because Peanute sauce I makes the world a better place.

I generally complain when people make multiple changes to recipes and then rate the recipe they didn't cook- like the time a woman changed a red bean beef chili recipe to a vegetarian white chili and rated it a 5!!!! But in this case, this is such a simple and yummie marinade you can substitute based on what you have available and it's still great.  I used all lemon, agave nectar instead of sugar and regular mustard(marinaded 8 hours but didn't add mustard until last 3 hours). I had good intentions of grocery shopping earlier in the day.  Served w green salad w/ kiwi fruit and a dressing made from o.j, dijon mustard, red wine vinegar and olive oil.

This is the best chicken marinade I've tried in years. I doubled the recipe and put about 1/4 aside for basting.  Then I put 3 chicken breasts each in large baggies and divided the remaining marinade between the two bags. I only had time to marinate them for 2-3 hours and they turned out fantastic -- tons of flavor. This is an easy way to prepare chicken and I will be making it often.

This is a good marinade but, the taste doesn't stay on the chicken. I think it might be better in the oven instead of on the grill.

This IS our favorite chicken recipe of all time.  I fixed it for a bridge luncheon and only had time to marinate for 4 hours and it was awesome.  Fixed it again a few days ago and marinated it overnight and baked it at 350 for 45 minutes and everyone said it was the best ever, even my picky grandson.  Couldn't grill it either time as a wren built her nest in our grill and we had to wait for the four babies to fly!  I would recommend NO changes.  Thank you so much for making me such a success! Jan

This is the best chicken marinade recipe I've ever made!  I doubled the recipe for a family gathering hoping for lots of leftovers for salads and sandwiches, but everyone loved it so much they had seconds!  By far, these were the best tasting, juiciest grilled chicken breasts I have ever eaten.  Thumbs up!

This one is a keeper !  I marinated in a ziploc bag for about 7 hours in the refrigerator, giving the bag a little "squish" once in a while.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.

I added frozen chicken and the marinade to a ziploc bag and let thaw/marinate in the refrigerator overnight.  Didn't have fresh lemon/lime so used bottled juice (I know...fresh is better) and about equal proportions of the juices to vinegar.  Used Boetje's stone ground mustard (this is more for my reference as it's a local product and I don't know how widely it's distributed) and vegetable oil instead of olive oil.  I love sweet and sour.  Tasty and easy.  I pounded the meat slightly just so it would grill evenly, and used my indoor grill pan.

I didn't have time to marinate the chicken for 9 hours (just about an hour) so I cut it up into pieces and then cooked it in a pan with the marinade. Then removed the chicken and reduced the sauce. Served with zucchini & parmesan. TASTY! I will cut the salt next time as it was a bit too salty for us.

This recipe is fantastic! I didn't change a thing about the marinade, but I did use whole bone-in, skin- on thighs and wings. They were so flavorful and juicy! Then we used the left overs in a casserole and the flavor of the marinade was just wonderful! Thank you for this great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I have even assembled everything in freezer Ziplocs, added the chicken, and froze for future use.  Then I just thaw when I want to make it.  It marinates while it thaws.

The chicken was really moist. I had to bake it instead of grill it because I don't own a grill. The flavor just wasn't really for me. I wouldn't say this was unbelievable, and I probably won't make it again.

I used less salt and oil, but otherwise stuck to the recipe and marinated overnight (about 24 hours actually).  The ingredients didn't sound like this chicken would be unbelievable.  The marinade itself actually didn't even smell good.    But on the grill it smelled amazing!!!  It kept the chicken very moist (except for my piece which I told my husband to burn for me...I like it dry).  The taste was very very very good.  I liked it a lot and the kids did too.  I wouldn't say it was actually "unbelievable", but this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I also love that this recipe uses ingredients I usually have on hand.  Since the first time making it, now I'll make extra and chop it up and use it on salad or in a wrap.  So awesome.

Really interesting combination of ingredients, which yields tasty and juicy chicken. I made the marinade before leaving for work - and left the chicken in it for 10 hours. I cooked the chicken on an indoor grill, and basted the chicken for the first half of the cooking time (added lots of flavour). Thanks for the recipe.

This was just great, I love chicken and always looking for something new to do with it. I agree with Sandy, that a recipe should not get a bad review if we have added or used other ingredients. I always like to try the recipe as is for the first time then tweek it later. thanks and good cooking. sue

Good flavor, but the vinegar definitely overpowered this dish. I did add an extra clove of garlic and some crushed red pepper, but the cider vinegar was still dominant. It wasn't bad though, but next time, I think I will cut back on the amount. All in all, as I stated at first, this was a flavorful dish. It just needs a bit of tweaking to be top notch.

Excellent.  Followed the recipe exactly and is was delicious.  My hubby was afraid with the olive oil he would have trouble with flare up but had no trouble at all.

Very Good.  The only ingredient I substituted was dijon for the ground mustard.  I marinated for 24 hours and achieved a nice, mildly seasoned chicken.  If you are looking for a very powerful seasoning this might not be the recipe for you.  This recipe is a keeper.

I got this from my Allrecipes the Daily Dish, and it was easy and delicious to make. However, I didn't have coarse ground mustard, so I used ground double superfine mustard. It turned out great! The chicken also gets a little bit of a carmalized crust from the brown sugar! The flavor is delicious, definetly making this again!

This got rave reviews at my house.  We've had it twice in the last two weeks.  The second time I served it cold on a sandwich, some of the family didn't even use any condiments it was so juicy & flavorful.  Highly recommended!  I even cheated with bottled juices and dijon mustard, still excellent.

this was really good. i only had a couple of hours to marinate the chicken, but i poked holes in the breasts per other reviewers suggestions. i imagine if they marinated overnight, the taste would be really delicious. i soaked my five large chicken breasts in a brine for 30 minutes before marinating. i rinsed them and dried them off and then added them to the marinade. i also added some red pepper flakes and a couple of squirts of sriracha. also, i reserved some of the marinade separate from the chicken and used it to baste. very juicy and really delicious...thank you.

I used red-wine vinegar and a whole lemon (instead of half) and did not add salt.  Only marinated it for a few hours, but since I used fairly thin chicken breasts, it still tasted great.  Also cooked it on a stove top grill.  Next time I will use a bit of red pepper flakes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I thought that the flavour was really lovely although I found it to be quite faint. I would love to try it again but marinate it for 24 hours or something...maybe then the flavor would be more distinct. either that or find a way to amke the marinade thicker so that it had better stick while grilling. I will try again for sure!

I found this to be on the bland side.   What I could taste was pretty good, but you'd think after marinating it all day long there'd be more flavor.  I followed instructions and didn't substitute, so either it really needs to marinate overnight, or my tastebuds require more flavor on the chicken than most folks.

Really good! We enjoyed the flavour of this. I did a half batch using: 2 TBS cider vinegar, 1 TBS spicy brown mustard, about 3/4 tsp garlic powder, ½ lime (juiced), around 1 TBS lemon juice, 1/4 cup brown sugar, around 1/4 tsp salt, four grinds of coarse pepper, and 1½ TBS olive oil. I had two huge chicken breasts (around 1½ pounds total) and I sliced them into strips. They sat in the fridge in a baggie for around nine hours, and I flipped the bag around periodically. 14 minutes total on the grill, perfect. Our daughter scarfed it down! Thanks for sharing, Letsgggo!

I've made this a bunch of times now and there are a few things you MUST do!  You MUST use fresh squeezed lemon and lime juice!  You MUST use "GROUND" mustard that is in the spices isle.  It really is so much better than using any type of prepared mustard IMO.  You MUST use fresh garlic- the jarred or powdered stuff just isn't the same.  Do these things and it will be a 5 star recipe for sure!    (Basically just FOLLOW THE RECIPE!!)

My hubby told me to hang onto this recipe, and to give it 5 stars! I pretty much followed the directions, except I used lemon and lime juice from bottles and used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. I grilled it on the foreman, since it's about 5 degrees outside, and served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Definitely a keeper!

I really liked this chicken. I cut down on the amount of brown sugar I put in it leaving it at 1 Tbsp, and added more lemon and lime than called for. I also cut up a shallot and put it in there. I marinated 4 pieces overnight and took 1 piece to work and popped it in the microwave (yes I said the microwave) It turned out juicy and tender. I intend on grilling the other 3 pieces tonight for dinner, but if the microwave version is any indication I think this will be even more fabulous.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!!  I couldn't find Coarse mustard so I used ground.  I cut the chicken into chunks, marinated it for over 24 hours and skewered them.  I didn't have the ingredients for kabobs, so we just ate it as is, with rice and veggis.  I REALLY wish we had made MUCH more chicken with this.  I only used 4 breasts, since it's myself, husband and  two little ones-- there were no leftovers.  I'm making this next time we have company!

Ok... this was SO easy and tasty! 

I marinated 12 skinless chicken thighs for over 24 hours. I didn't have any of the fancy mustard so I used 1.5 Tablespoons of horseradish (regular, not sauce) and I think next time, I will decrease or eliminate the oil altogether. All the oil did was sit on the top of the container that I marinated the chicken in. I baked it at 400 degrees for 45 minutes and it came out perfect. It smelled so good cooking that my Kiddo knocked on my door to ask what good food I was cooking. And now she wants to try it. 

VERY GOOD RECIPE. Thank you.

This is the best marinade, the chicken comes out sooo moist. I didn't have applecider vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead and I used Splenda instead of the brown sugar because we follow the South beach diet. Awesome will be using this again and again!

Very flavorful and delicious. Thin sliced 3 cutlets, marinated overnight and cooked on the stovetop with the marinade. Enough marinade for sauce to pour over the chicken. Substituted cider vinegar for red wine vinegar and followed the recipe exactly. Next time would cut back slightly on the mustard as a tiny bit too strong. Served over rosemary garlic mashed potatos and green beans. I think the rosemary complimented the mustard taste in the chicken. Thanks for a great recipe!

This wasn't bad, it just wasn't unbelievable either.  There are other marinades out there that are better.

HI, I have to say, when I made the marinate for this recipe last night, I really thought I wasn't going to like it. There was such a strong smell from the different ingredients. But as I was grilling the chicken the smell got less intense. The taste was EXCELLENT. My husband absolutely loved it. He said to make sure I rate this recipe a 5.I  will be useing this recipe again for sure. Thanks for such a great recipe. Sincerely, Judy

I tried this on chicken drumsticks and grilled them.  It turned out really well.  I would do this again.

Yum!  I have to admit I probably didn't use the right proportions of everything (couldn't get the mustard out of the jar so I just guessed that it was about the right amount and mixed everything in there :)).  I also used lemon and lime juice from bottles and didn't know how much to use, so I guessed.  I was a little skeptical but SOOO glad I tried this - hubby and I have been in a grilled chicken rut, always using bbq sauce, and this was a wonderful change.  Will make again and again.

I made this for my kids because I was not sure they would like a fish dish I was also preparing.  It was ok, just nothing spectacular, they ending up eating the fish.  Used the leftovers on top of a salad for lunch and I would say the flavor probably improved with age.

This had a very tangy flavour with the vinegar, lemon/lime juice and mustard.  We thought it was a refreshing change from the usual sweeter marinades. I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and added a splash of soy sauce for salt content instead of the salt as written because it seemed excessive.

This was very good and kept the chicken moist, but not as flavorful as I'd hoped.  I used it for kabobs, and everyone loved them, so I will definitely use this recipe again.

I had to try this after seeing all the reviews!  It was great!  I really wasn't expecting to be so pleased with this recipe's results.  I've made this a few times and it's really good.  I fixed it on an indoor grill and it came out perfect.  This was very flavorful!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Good marinade for grilled chicken.  Ingredients are what I usually have on hand, so preparaction 'twas easy.  I did leave chicken in the marinade almost 24 hours, and flavor came through just fine.  Thanks for the recipe, Ruthie!

This is wonderful! I did it overnight and it made the chicken very tender, juicy and flavorful! We will definitely make this again!

The only change was that I didn't have grainy mustard so I used Grey Poupon.

I'm making my first-ever kabobs for a family BBQ this weekend, so I'm test-driving marinades.  I only had three breasts, so I halved the recipe (and quartered the amount of brown sugar), then let them marinate for almost 24 hours.  Very, very good (thumbs up from my husband, who's getting chicken-weary).  I will definitely use this weekend!

Yummy!  I marinated chicken legs/drumsticks for 7 hours in this concoction, then grilled. Delicious.  I think it would be outstanding using boneless breasts.  With the legs, it could have marinated longer for more intense flavor though.

Great Marinade.  Made with everyday ingredients. Even my children loved it. This will be one recipe I use often. Especially when I need a non-spicy marinade. Since my children do not like marinades with alot of spices or garlic.

This is the best marinade!  I always plan to make it at the last minute and the longest I have ever let it sit in the marinade is 8 hours.  If I could just let it sit for 12, I bet it would be even better.  My kids all love this, even my very picky 6 year old.  I made an extra batch up for a co-worker and she said that is all her daughter ask for anymore.  Thank you so much!

I have used AllRecipies.com for quite a long time but have never felt compelled to write a review until now.  This is an excellent marinade.  I made it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  My finicky family (who cringes when I cook something new) asked when I could make it again.  A definite new favorite!  Thanks.

I had to cook lunch for my office...my entire office of 100 people!  I used only fresh ingredients and it still took only 8 hours over 2 days.  I had many requests for the recipe so I've forwarded it to everyone (plus your website's URL, of course).  It was a big success.

This marinade was unbelievable.  I made it for a kid's birthday party and both the adults/kids devoured it.  I will definately make this again and again.

This was a delicious marinade and I loved it! I was leery to try it at first because I had never tried a marinade before. This made the chicken juicy and full of flavor. I am glad I picked this marinade to try as my first one. Delicious!

The title says it all. It is absoultly unbelievably delicious. I didn't have the grain mustard but I subituted french's yellow mustard instead, and it was excellent.  I am happy to say that it will be a regular in our home.  Thanks Ruthie.

This marinade is the best! It will now become my regular,favorite marinade. I didn't have the whole grain mustard so I substituted 2 tablespoons of French's yellow mustard and 1 tablespoon of a hot stadium mustard and it still came out EXCELLENT! Ruthie this is a keeper!!!! Thanks.I recommend this to everyone, it makes delicious chicken! You will get compliments.

I did not make any changes and it was fantastic. My husband loved it and I will make it again.  I did only use part of it because I only did 2 chicken breast. The other I put in the freezer for later.

Great tasting marinade and easy! I've used it on boneless and bone-in chicken. Simply throw all the ingredients in a large Ziploc bag, add chicken and, and you're all set.

This was amazing, my whole family, including young children loved it. I used chicken tenders and a grill pan on the stove. Since they were smaller cuts of meat, I only marinated them for 6 hours. I boiled the leftover marinade on the stove for 10 minutes and poured over the finished chicken. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I didn’t have the coarse ground mustard & used regular French’s mustard. Marinated for 8 hours & slapped it on the grill. Still, this was unbelievably delicious! Next time I make it I will used the proper mustard.

Delicious chicken! I only marinated the chicken for 3 hours, and it had plenty of flavor. My chicken breasts were on the thinner side, so it was perfect! I will definitely make this again- thank you!

So yummy! I have made this countless times, and my family loves it! I like to add 1.5t of paprika and about 5T soy sauce to the marinade, and up the garlic by quite a bit, depending on what I feel like, when I make it. But then, I am a big garlic lover. If you're not, the amount in the recipe might work for you. I also like to grate some of the lime zest into the recipe and throw in some sliced carrots and peppers, too. I usually do it on the stove top, but, today, I baked it in the oven, on broil, but found it wasn't browning, so I took the chicken out when it was mostly cooked, and then gave it a 1-2 mins, on each side, on a VERY HOT pan to get that sugar carmelization and oh my gosh it was amazing! So soft and succulent on the inside, and then that crisp, charred flavor on the outside was heavenly! After all chicken is cooked, I throw in the veggies and stir fry, on high heat, for a 2-3 mins, depending on how soft you like your veggies, and sprinkle them over the chicken. Finally, I spoon a little bit of reserved marinade over the entire thing, while still hot. Delish! Also, you don't have to marinade very long if you use this method. I just poke holes into the chicken, marinade it for a few mins while I'm heating up the oven, chopping veggies and doing some kitchen cleanup and then throw it on. As long as you reserve some of the marinade for spooning over, trust me, it will have PLENTY of flavor!

I don't normally write reviews because I usually end up altering a recipe..adding my own flair.  However, this time I followed it to a T.  I was expecting an average flavor but man oh man, it was AWESOME!   This is for sure a keeper.  I melted some swiss cheese on the chicken, topped with a little grilled pineapple and severed as a sandwich on King Hawaiian bread.  Truly amazing and everyone devoured it. Thanks for sharing!

I figure 5 stars means  it was awesome and everyone loved it.  And that is exactly right.  Don't write reviews usually, but this was worthy.  Only  mistake I made was I used canola oil instead of olive as I misread it.  Not sure if that would have changed anything, but everything else was same.  Only had time for a 5 hr period, so did end up cutting for kabobs.  Used freshly squeezed juices.  Thank you for recipe.

Have made this 3 x.  Most recently for a family party of 25.  Everyone raves about the chicken and had several requests for the recipe. Made exactly as recipe and marinated overnight.

Delicious!!! My 8 & 5 yr old girls LOVED it. I will be making this for a long time. Side notes - I couldn't find lime at the moment so I just added a little more lemon juice (about half the called amount of lime juice) and hoped for the best. Be sure to preheat your grill on high/med-high, put meat on, then turn down to medium. You're sure to get the yummy char marks that really compliment the flavor. Don't overcook - not even a minute. I plan to make with lime in the future as well as with margarita mix as suggested by another reader. Served with steamed rice, salad, and some BBQ sauce for the kiddos.

Great marinade. I wasn't unable to let it marinade over night so I'm sure it would have been even better that way. Its winter so no grilling for me, instead I did it on the stove top. When I make the chicken again, I'll cook it in the oven next time. The flavors are prominent. I used Dijon mustard in place of the ground mustard and it was still very good.

Made this recipe for July 4th and everyone loved it including me.  I made a few minor changes only because of our taste.  We are garlic lovers so I added a few cloves.  I also had a shallot so I minced that and added it.  I followed another's advice and used 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of 6T.  Will make this again!!

We loved this chicken. It was a nice balance between tangy and sweet. I made it as directed with no modifications. I  marinated it overnight and grilled it the next day at dinner time. Will be making it again very soon!

I made this for dinner tonight. The only thing I changed is that I used the juice of a whole lemon because I didn't have a lime on hand. I marinated the chicken for about 8 hours and it was flavorful and delicious and VERY tender. My husband liked it too in spite of the fact that he doesn't like the main ingredients (vinegar, mustard or lemon!). I was surprised that he liked it so much. It was raining outside so I heated some butter in a pan and fried it in a skillet. The next time I hope to grill it. This is a winner and will go in my recipe box for another night.

This recipe exceeded my expectations! I followed it exactly except I didn't have fresh lime, so I used lime juice from the fridge. I also doubled the recipe (don't know if that was necessary)  since I had six very large chicken breast which I cut in half. I left the chicken to marinade for 24 hours before my husband grilled it. It had a great flavor and was really really good. And I'm not even a big fan of meat, but I found myself really enjoying it. My husband (a true meat eater) loved the recipe too. We had planned to freeze some of the leftover chicken, but it wasn't necessary as we ate on it all week long. Threw some in an omelet for breakfast, threw some on salad for lunch, ate some with quinoa for dinner... You get the idea. Whenever we grill chicken again, this will definitely be the first recipe I consider. Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe.  I cut it in half and used it with 8 chicken breast tenders.  I grilled them and served over salad.  I reserved part of the marinade and drizzled it over the salad as dressing.  The only (minor) changes I made were to increase the garlic to 3 cloves and only used lime juice (no lemon).  Yummy stuff!

I love this recipe. My husband and kids don't care for it as much, but the fresh, bright flavors are nice. Easy to get dry because it cooks so fast. I cook on the stovetop usually and watch carefully. I follow the marinade as written.

We are always looking for new marinades for chicken. I have made this twice. First time I only let it sit marinate for 4 hours and used the George Foreman grill. The second time I let it sit over night and baked it in the oven 400 degrees for 45 min. It was a lot tastier letting it marinate over night. I didn't have cider vinegar so I used balsamic. I will try again in the summer time on the BBQ with cider vinegar. Thank you for the recipe.

This is my go-to marinade recipe for the grill but I use it mainly for pork chops.  Fantastic flavor.  I add a few shakes of crushed red pepper for a little kick.  Excellent!

Well, finally a NEW recipe that the family LOVED! Even my husband said, "This is good!" and he is not a chicken guy : )
Good thing I made 8 chicken breasts because everyone ate two.  The only substitution I had to do was use Deli Style Spicy Brown mustard rather than coarse ground mustard.

Was tasty and colorful just like others have said. Did not change a thing. Only had 3 hours to marinade the slightly frozen chicken and it was very tasty. Was told by my husband it was a keeper!

Im not giving this 5 stars, only because I changed one ingredient. I do not like mustard, so I left that out and used 3 tbs of Korean pepper powder (NOT Cheyenne pepper), instead. We used it on chicken kebabs that only marinated about an hour and on some mushrooms, all cooked on a grill. The scent was awesome and it tasted great!

The marinade sounded really good. However, in following grilling directions on the site, our chicken ended up with a burned skin which did not add to the flavor. I may try this again but with lower heat.

Unbelievably moist and delicious. I didn't change a thing. Just be sure to make ahead as it needs to marinate for 8 hrs.

I made this the night before and it was Very tasty. Omitted the garlic die to am intolerance and used thighs instead of breast and it was very good. Will definitely use it the next time I cook breast.

This was a good base recipe for marinade. I was making chicken kabobs so I made double the recipe for the marinade in order to marinate the raw chicken separately from the vegetables. The marinade has a very good flavor but it is definitely too sweet for me. I think in the future I will replace the brown sugar with 1/4 c. - 1/3 c. of honey, add some hot pepper flakes and about 1/4 c. of Sriracha since I like sweet & hot. BTW, if you have a Food Saver vacuum system you can cut the marinating time down to about 2 hours.

What a fantastic marinade! I cut chicken breasts into chunks before marinating them for about 5 hours. I made another batch of the marinade, and poured it over chunks of green, yellow and orange pepper, onion, zucchini, and baby portabella mushrooms for about an hour. I drained the vegetables, reserving the marinade, before alternating the veggies and chicken on metal skewers. We grilled them over medium low heat for about 20 minutes, turning and basting them with the reserved marinade about every 5 minutes. I served it with Balsamic Vinegar Bruschetta from this site and a corn salad. It was an absolutely perfect meal for a summer evening!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic! After BBQing this chicken was amazing. Don't change anything in this recipe. It was perfect. I marinated the chicken almost 24 hours (made it after dinner for the next nights dinner) and it worked out beautifully.

I thought it was super yummy, but my kids didn't like them too much, I was surprised. Instead of grilling I baked my bone-in thighs in the sauce for 45 minutes at 350 and they were moist and cooked through. I didn't marinate for very long though so I will try this recipe again after marinating longer.

This was a really great recipe.  It was very easy to put together, and I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I was only able to let the chicken marinade for only 2 hours, but it still tasted wonderful.  I will definitely use this again, but next time I will plan better and let it marinade overnight.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This recipe is soooo good! It is so moist and flavorful but not overkill. I used Dijon mustard as that is what I had. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I ended up marinating for 2 days as plans changed. It was so delicious! This is an awesome recipe, thanks for sharing, LETSGGGO! This is a keeper for sure!

This was worth every second it took. I followed the recipe to the tea even though I could not imagine them blending well and honestly I don't even like citrus flavor in general, but this was amazing! I couldn't marinate for the full 8 hours and it still came out moist and delicious.

I was very surprised and extremely pleased with this recipe. I wasn't able to use the exact proportions, due to lack of ingredient, and it was still really tasty. Love it?  Will do again.  Oh, one thing I forgot to say earlier is that I broiled  in oven  7 mins each side. So, yes I changed it out if necessity, so the original and unchanged version is probably unimaginably delicious.

I used mustard seed and grounded it instead of prepared mustard, it tasted good. When you use the grounded mustard seed make sure to not leave any clumps and spread it evenly over the chicken.

I made this chicken for the first time for a friends birthday.  It was a huge hit!  Everyone raved about the flavor, how juicy the chicken was and I'm happy to say, there were no leftovers!  It's easy to make and the longer it marinates, the better!  Very happy with this recipe.

Great recipe, i would not recommend making more chicken then you would consume for the dinner in order to save for meals later on. It still has some flavor but the when microwaved the marinade thins out and is gone. Other than that it is has been added to the keep pile

It was a little too sweet for my taste. I marinated overnight, seared on the Forman then placed in oven. It was ok but not delicious. I won't make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  I used what mustard I had on hand which was mostly Dijon Mustard and a little yellow mustard and I added some ground mustard.  I only did four chicken breasts and I reserved about a cup of the marinade for dipping. This is going in my favorites for sure.

Yummy marinade. I did everything exactly the same except I did not have ground mustard. So I just got regular mustard and covered the chicken in it before putting the chicken in the rest of the mix.

Just made this for a BBQ and it turned out wonderful! I marinated full boneless chicken breasts overnight and grilled the chicken at about 400 degrees for 7 1/2 min. per side inside a grill basket I coated with cooking spray. They were moist and juicy and the marinade coating was delicious! Definitely going into my 'make often' recipe box!

OMG!  This was absolutely wonderful!  Marinated overnight.  Used only lemon juice and deli style mustard.  Chicken steaks on a grill, no more than 6-7 minutes per side.  Rest.  Slice on bias!  Oh! So Good!!

Very tasty! Made for guest. Marinated 36 hours, cooked on (too) hot grill on one side. Nearly burnt and smoked to ruin, then washed literally w water to remove smoke damage. Threw in crock pot w marinade low for 4 or 5 hr till after church. Kinda sweet but afraid to reduce sugar as it may be a tenderizing element.

I cubed chicken breasts because that is what I had and I needed to make them in a hurry.  My family loved the chicken on the grill with this marinade.  I also used the remaining marinade and thickened it with cornstartch to make a sauce, which was delicious.

After a week of quick meals, I was in the mood to cook and to try something new. The email featuring this recipe caught my attention. The only changes I made were to use only lemon juice from a bottle (it was all I had) and substituted 1 t. of Penzey's Spices Ozark Style Seasoning for salt and pepper. This was delicious served with brown rice and sauted zucchini. Keeper!

This is my FAVORITE chicken marinade recipe from this site, and I have tried many! Great flovor without being salty or too strong. I used leg/thigh quarters & breasts w/bone and skin. Put them in the marinade the night before and grilled when I got home from work. Delish!!! Note: watch your flame, cook on low-med/low so your marinade/skin doesn't burn like mine did. Even with that, it was really good. Can't wait to make again!

I've made this twice now and my husband has declared this to be our go to chicken marinade from now on.  The first time I made it with chicken breast halves.  I was afraid I might have grilled it too long trying to get the thickest part of the breasts cooked through.  It still came out moist and delicious.  The second time I used it one chicken thighs and it grilled quicker and again was moist and flavorful.  Fresh lime/lemon juice is the key.  Excellent simple marinade.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I thought it was O.K. solely because you can definitely taste the mustard and I am not a big mustard fan.

I made this for the first time in May 2009.I use this marinade almost every time I grill chicken (and we are grilling fools since we have appropriate grilling weather year round). My family loves it every time - I make it for weeknight dinner and large family get-togethers since so many of them like it so much!
It is a sweet marinade, and we do not find it bland, as the acid from the cider vinegar and fruit juice is a nice balance to the sugar. I do cut the chicken into smaller pieces - about three strips per chicken breast half (this helps it to cook evenly), so maybe that is the answer to those who think it was bland - smaller pieces allow more of that lovely, crispy-sweet exterior to form as the chicken grills.

I didn't know exactly what to expect from this recipe because it looked like a very simple marinade.  I was pleasantly surprised because the flavor was very good!  We had the leftovers for grilled chicken sandwiches the next day for lunch and it was even better!  FYI....I checked google and one lemon is typically 3 tbsp. of juice and 1 lime is typically 2 tbsp. of juice.

This recipe turned out delicious! I made extra intending to pack it for lunch tomorrow, but it was so good that we ended up eating all of it! I over cooked the chicken a bit so it was a little bit dry, but we dipped it in some of the coarse mustard and it was even better that way. I followed the recipe exact, except I only added about half as much brown sugar (my hubby doesn't like sweet chicken). One of my new favorite marinades, I will definitely be using it again!

This recipe was SO easy! I followed the recipe exactly, and cooked stovetop the next day. The marinade became a sort of slightly Asian barbecue sauce. It was wonderful! I marinated chicken thighs instead of breasts and the meat was just scrumptious with all those flavors! Next time I would probably add a little heat, and use 1/3 cup sugar instead. I like a little more kick. Restaurant quality recipe for sure!

Fantastic.  Really does make great, juicy chicken.  The one issue is you cannot cook this over high heat, the brown sugar will burn almost right away.  Cook longer over lower heat.

Really tasty.  I didn't have the prepared mustard so I used ground mustard (1 tsp = 1 tbl of the prepared mustard).  I baked them in the marinade in the oven for 30 min at 350.  I also only marinated them about an hour before and it still had a lot of flavor (probably from cooking it while it was soaking).

Nice mustard flavor! I marinated overnight. I made this on my George Foreman instead of the gas grill. Might have turned out better on the gas grill.

Truly wonderful marinade!  Needed a recipe that was gluten free and this was wonderful!  It was not a harsh flavor and the chicken was perfect on salads!  Will definitely make again with a side of rice and vegetable!

We absolutely love this recipe!! This is a favorite of two of my six kids.  I have made it from the recipe exactly and get a great result.  But I love to be creative and try variations.  So my favorite changes to this recipe is to reduce mustard to 1 Tbls. and then add 2 Tbls. of Heinz 57 steak sauce.  I also reduce the garlic from 3 cloves to 2 cloves.  It is just a tangy alternative creation that gets RAVES!!!  Just thought that I would share.  Happy cooking.

This was awesome!  I cut the brown sugar in half (just a personal preference - I don't like really sweet meat), and was so glad I did!  I marinated mine overnight, then baked (uncovered) at 350 for 40 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very moist, but the chicken didn't really have any flavor. I marinated it from 10pm till 6pm the following day. The marinade was a lot of work and expensive considering I didn't taste any lime, lemon, or brown sugar once cooked. I made the recipe exactly as written, and I even used less chicken than called for.

Delicious, easy chicken recipe!!  There was only one problem.............I didn't make enough!  Everyone was fighting over the last piece.  I used chicken thighs instead as that is what we prefer.  I will make is recipe many times.

This was a fantastic marinade.  I would use it again.  Didn't change a thing accept after the chicken was done marinating I cooked the marinade and then basted the chicken while grilling. Made it so juicy and moist.

I fixed this for the second time tonight. My husband raved about it the first time I fixed it. He raved about it tonight and asked why we didn't have it more often. I doubled the recipe and used skinless, boneless thighs because I don't like breast. I kept 1 cup of marinade out to pour over chicken. I served it with black beans and yellow rice. Delicious!!! Thanks for this recipe!

OMG!  I don't know what it is about this combo of ingredients, but this marinate is fantastic!  I didn't change a thing.  Have my second batch of chix breasts marinating now for grilling tonight! Fresh, sweet corn on the cob goes great with it!

This chicken is awesome. I didn't change not one thing, I used all the ingredients needed and boy did it taste fantastic. I was not able to marinade the chicken for 8 hours, I just whipped up the marinade and let the chicken soak for about 2 minutes moving the chicken around so it will have an even coat. I made sure to have a lot of marinade on both side before I put it on the grill. I loved the chicken it came it so tender and flavorful, imagine of I would of left the chicken over night marinating?

Made this marinade the night before going camping and the chicken then sat in it the whole day on the way to the camp site.  That night I cooked it and WOW - we are all so impressed with the full flavor.  The sweet and tart mixture was great with the grilled chicken.  Will use this again!

I liked this better the second day, sliced up and on a salad.  I saved and froze some extra marinade, maybe I'll like it more the next time.

This was pretty good, certainly did make the chicken very tender, however they weren't the best flavored chicken we've tried. Followed the recipe to a tee, except we sear and then grill over indirect heat.

My wholoe family loved this chicken!!  Definitely a keeper!!  I used splenda instead of brown sugar to cut down on calories and didn't add any olive oil, either.  It still tasted really good.  I bet the original recipe would be even better.  I broiled but definetely would grill on the outside BBQ grill the next time.

Great flavor! The fact that the recipe only uses common ingredients makes it even better!  The only change I made was reducing the salt a little to a tsp since I am trying to limit my salt consumption.

Okay, but not unbelievable.  I marinated overnight and it was a little too tangy from the citrus. I boiled then basted with the marinade.  Using more brown sugar and creating a glaze would help.

Great recipe, and I'm usually not that fond of chicken breasts.  Used jalapeno mustard and halved the sugar and oil.  I placed meat in a zip-lock with the marinade and put in the ice chest to take camping.  Grilled the next day over charcoal for chicken burgers.  Awesome!!  Will definitely make again.  Would give it 10 stars if I could.

i Haven't made this yet, but careful with the shopping list if you create one.  it says to buy 6 limes, one per chicken breast, when the recipe only calls for one.

Terrific marinade makes for a very moist and yummy chicken. My sister was determined to put BBQ sauce on the chicken, but after trying it, decided it didn't need it after all (that says a LOT). I had a very juicy lime so I left out the lemon juice, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Made it twice in one weekend; the second time I reduced the amount of sugar a bit and liked that better.

Let's be real, this chicken really is unbelievable! I only make chicken with this marinade now.  I tried this on my boyfriend the first time I made it, he is super super picky and told me after that he fully expected to have to lie about enjoying the chicken...now this is all he wants.  He said he could eat this 5 times a week, as could I.  

My new favorite thing is to take the remaining marinade and cook it in a saucepan to make a sauce and serve it over the chicken, over roasted veggies, in pasta with some alfredo sauce (our preferred method).  One thing I should say is that I substitute dijon mustard for course-ground mustard.

Very good marinade, I followed the recipe exactly. My only problem was I marinaded for 6 hours only, would recommend overnight or at least the recommended 8.

I do not normally write reveiews, so that should say something about how impressed I was with this recipe. 
I followed the recipe exactly for the marinade, but I used skinless bone-in thighs. This was so good, my husband declared it a keeper!!

Made this today and it is very good! I loved it on top of salad, and my 2-yr-old son enjoyed it with rice and veggies. The next time I make it, I will reduce the apple cider vinegar by maybe half, as it had a very overpowering flavor. Will definitely make again!

This is the best marinade and most of the stuff you already have in your pantry/fridge!! My 6 year old raved about it and said it's the only kind of chicken she ever wants from now on. Good enough to make your whole family happy!!

First of all, let me say that I am not a fan of vinegar. I thought will all the other ingredients in this recipe, that the vinegar would just blend in.  It didn't.  It had a honey-mustard taste to it (which was ok, nothing special) but then the cider vinegar was really strong. My husband tried it & even he didn't like it and he eats anything!  Just wasn't a winner for us.

This is a great marinade. I have to say after looking at the ingredients I was a little scared but it turned out great. I cooked it as k-bobs with pineapple. I used concentrated lime juice, lemon juice and dijon mustard because that is all I had and it was wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

Glad I made this for family before I made it for company. I wanted to make it and taste for myself but I have to agree with other posters about it being bland. It's not bad just has very little flavor.

What a great, light, summery recipe! We liked the marinade so much we set some aside for our salad! Thanks-I did substitute dijon for ground mustard because that was what  we had available. still great!

Even my picky kids loved it, it was a hit! I didn't change anything, except that I used 2 REALLY large cloves of garlic instead of 3. I made the marinade and put it in the bag with the chicken as it defrosted, flipped the bag once and it was great!

Only good thing about this recipe is how moist the chicken is.  Otherwise, there's nothing spectacular about it.  I'm removing from my recipe box and will look for something that has significantly more flavor.

Absolutely wonderful chicken!  I doubled the mustard and used a combination of dijon and coarse grain mustard.  Other than that everything else was left the same.  I marinated the chicken for 24 hours.  The chicken was tender and juicy with the best flavor.  I think this marinade would be great on pork chops too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This chicken was ok.  It was not as flavorful as I would have liked but then again I only marinated it for approx. 7 hours.  I will try this again due to all the great reviews but will marinate overnight.

I really enjoyed the sweet and tangy flavor that this marinade made.  Also, after marinating for 8 hours, my chicken was so moist and tender - I real departure from my usual!  However, the best this about this recipe is the fact that I already have all of the ingredients on hand, so I can make this almost any time without advance notice.  I baked this because it's too cold to grill.  And, I think I may play with the mustard, and maybe use a combo of dijon and honey mustard next time, just to see.

enh - this was definitely not "unbelievable" for us.  It was a decent marinade, but nothing truly special.  I found it to be a little more mustard-y than I would have liked, and my children did not much care for it, whereas usually they love grilled chicken.  I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I will be making it again.

This chicken is very sweet and I would put it in the Asian family of flavors. It worked well over mashed potatos, a mixed greens salad and rice. I liked it but my husband didn't like the taste at all.

After reading all the positive reviews, I was expecting a lot more.  I marinated the chicken for a day and while it was moist and juicy, it surprisingly seemed to lack flavor.  I think there are probably better marinade recipes out there.

Maybe not quite unbelievable, but more like pretty good.  I am not sold on it being a staple at our house, but the marinade had a nice flavor.

Soooooo good! My 13 month old son is allergic to dairy and it is difficult to find something that the whole family loves. We ALL loved this one! Even my in-laws! And it is so easy! That in itself warrants 5 stars!

It was terrific!  Even my husband, who thinks most boneless chicken is too dry, loved it.  I also used the margarita mix (as someone had suggested), after dusting off the bottle, as I did not have lemon and lime.  And I only marinated for 4 hours.

I made this marinade exactly as written and it was delicious. I whisked everything into a bowl, emulsified the olive oil in, and then poured it into a gallon size freezer bag with the chicken. I popped it into my fridge over night. Tossed it on the grill. Delicious!

YUM! Just made this tonight it was SO good & basically fool-proof. I used red-wine vinegar bc thats what i had, yellow mustard instead of coarse mustard, garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, & instead of grilling i sauted in a pan and let the breasts simmer in the sauce. Turned out fantastic. I was worried bc the sauce smelled very vinegary- but came out amazing. Hubby was impressed and we gobbled it up! Served with buttered corn- YUM:) Great week night meal!

This is a nice marinade, but I wouldn't say that it was unbelievable.  We thought that it was a little too sweet would cut back on the sugar.  Overall it was an easy marinade.

I baked this in the oven with bone in, skin on breast and it turned out moist and flavorful - but not flavorful enough. I didnt have any lemon so I added more lime juice and I substituded coarse-ground mustard for spicy brown mustard because that is what I had on hand. I dont know that my substitutions would make that much of a difference in the taste. As good as it was, it didnt knock my socks off. That being said, I would probably make again.

This is a very good recipe.  I marinated chicken thighs overnight and cooked them on a pan over the stove.  It was a good alternative to my usual seasoning, and will make this again from time to time, thanks!

This marinate is amazing.  I didnt use as much sugar as I dont like marinades quite so sweet.  I used the splenda brown sugar and only used a couple tablespoons.  I cut up the chicken for skewers and marinated the meat overnight.  They turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe

Although, I don't think I'd describe this as unbelievable, it was very good. The chicken was very moist and you could taste the marinade throughout (I marinaded overnight). I'll probably make this again.

Really disappointing.  I followed the recipe to a T and grilled it on the George Foreman.  It was very blah and reminded me of a fish marinade.  I won't be making it again. :(

A family favorite. This is such a great marinade!  Garlic powder can be easily subbed for the crushed garlic.  I do 1/2 tsp per clove.  I've made this countless times on the George Foreman Grill, then this weekend my husband grilled these on the grill over mesquite chips. Excellent!

This chicken was extremely flavorful. I definitely do recommend marinating overnight, though, which I didn't have time to do. Also, I would make extra marinade, set it aside, and use it as a glaze/dipping sauce. Yum!

Truly fantastic.   Super easy (foolproof) recipe - even my lovely, cooking-challenged wife, can make it perfectly.   Definitely worth the overnight marinating, but turns out pretty darn good with just one hour marinating in in the fridge.   Use proper grilling techniques so chicken is not over or underdone.  Enjoy!

This is very tasty. I used apple cider vinegar (couldn't find regular cider vinegar, if there is such thing), and there was no vinegar taste after the chicken was cooked. It did not dry out on the grill, was very tender and juicy, even after reheating leftovers in the microwave. Best grilled chicken marinade I've found. Marinated for about 8 hours in the fridge.

I've made this twice - but the first time, it was better.  I made this with chicken tenders.  The first time, I marinated for about 3 hours and then grilled the chicken on an indoor grill, spooning the leftover marinade over the chicken as it cooked.  That was fantasticly tasty, yet simple with a little tang.  The second time, I marinated it for about 12 hours and then cooked it in a saute pan, again spooning the extra marinade over the chicken.  That wasn't nearly as good.  I'll definitely make this again, but I'll be grilling it.

Good flavor but certainly not unbelievable.  I marinated this all night and then the next day until I cooked it.  With that much brown sugar I expected this to be too sweet, which I'm not that into, but once cooked it really wasn't.  I basted it one time.  I have a charcoal grill, which pretty much ends up on "high" unless I cover it with only the lid vents open - even then it burned easily and I can't comprehend how high on a gas grill wouldn't just burn this to death.  But despite all that, it did hold the flavor well, even to the leftovers the next day that I nuked.  But most of the flavor was still just on the outside.  (I tend to slice stuff like this so I'm getting outside w/inside, and not getting bites of just inside chunks.)  I'd like to see what this is like just baking it.

This was good. I followed the recipe exactly for boneless skinless chicken breasts. The meat had really good flavor and was a nice change from my usual teriyaki chicken marinade. I'd make it again for sure.

I stuck to this recipe, except for the fact that I used Apple Cider Vinegar.  The chicken was tasty, and moist, but the Cider Vinegar was a little over powering.  It was a nice change from the regular boring grilled chicken I BBQ.  I will try again with just Cider Vinegar.

I marinated my chicken a day and a half and the flavor was wonderful. Served with herbed mashed potatoes and broccoli which made for a fast and healthy meal. Will make this again.

Yep, it's unbelievable alright!  I made the recipe exactly as written and marinated overnight.  I love that this marinade uses ingredients I always have on hand.  I will use this recipe again and again!

The sauce is delicious!  I added just a hint of fresh mustard (I'm not a huge fan) and it gave it just the right kick!  If you're going to be making this in the oven, be aware that you do need to marinate ahead of time (not just during cooking) or the sauce will not permeate the chicken.

I cooked this chicken while camping.  I had marinated it for 2 days and was all ready to throw it on the grill that was SUPPOSED to be at the camp site.  Little did we know that we'd really be roughing it more than we thought, because the grill was missing and our only source of cooking a  meal was on the campfire!!  We put our raw chicken on sticks, shrugged out shoulders, and patiently flipped the chicken on a stick every few minutes.  The result...  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  The marinade was excellent, the chicken was moist and the only complaint I have is my sore arm from holding a big piece of chicken on a long stick for about 30 minutes or so.  :-) Can't blame anyone but myself for that one, though!  Great recipe, can't wait to actually make it in my own kitchen!

It was just fine. Didn't ruin my chicken, but as there are a dozen other unbelievably good marinades I prefer to this, I won't be making it again. Thanks for the chance to try something new.

Not quite "unbelievable", but pretty darn good!  My family was very happy with this chicken-- it is a keeper!  Very moist and flavorful.  We did add a few shakes of red pepper flakes, plus a "spritz" of soy sauce and 1/8 tsp. dried Oregano to the marinade.   Very good, thanks for giving us the recipe!

This recipe is INCREDIBLE. My tip: bake the chicken in the marinade until cooked through, then remove from marinade and grill on both sides until skin is crispy. By soaking the chicken in the sauce while it cooked, the flavour soaked in thoroughly despite my not actually marinading it for very long in advance. This also meant it stayed deliciously juicy and tender while the skin had a gorgeous crunch. PERFECT!

I ended up marinating for two nights instead of one and it turned out really tender and flavorful, perfect for the BBQ.  Will keep this recipe handy for more BBQ's to come.

Very good! I didn't have time to marinate it for the whole 8 hours, but still very tender and juicy! I will make this again and marinate for the full time to really get the full flavor. Thanks!

This was quite tasty but I wouldn't label it unbelievable, that is what my guests said when I served this at a barbecue recently.  I made 6 pounds of chicken tenders and had to guess on the adjustment of measurements.  Almost all of it was gone, so in my book this recipe gets an A!  Thanks for sharing!

It's hard making chicken my boyfriend like, but he loved this recipe. It turned out moist and flavorful. You have to marinate it for at least 6 hours, I think, for the flavor to truly set in.

I was worried at first cuz the marinade was so yellow and reeked of mustard. And I read a comment that someone thought it was too mustardy/soury. Well I'm glad I tried it cuz once it was grilled all the flavors came together quite nice. My only regret was not saving the liquid to baste the chicken with as it grilled. I even used apple vinegar cider as it was the only "cider" vinegar I had on hand. Will make again and again. Thanks for posting.

This chicken had very good flavor.  I marinated for approx 24 hours which I think is why the flavor was so intense.  I could really taste the sweet and savory flavors of the apple cider vinegar.  I also had some problems with pieces being dry.  I think they were grilled too long.  I will definitely try this again and decrease the grill time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVED this chicken! I was out of minced garlic so I used garlic powder. I didn't have any coarse-ground mustard so I just used regular yellow mustard. I also used the bottled lemon and lime juice. Basically I just subbed for what I had on hand. It still turned out fantastic. Next time I will make it exactly to the recipe.

My family loves this marinade, especially my picky husband. I was nervous about using so much mustard but the flavors all blend together so nicely with the chicken. I use most of the marinade to marinade the chicken. The remainder I use for basting while the chicken is on the grill. And then I boil the marinade that the chicken was sitting in for 2-3 minutes to use as extra sauce on the side (that way the raw garlic isn't so strong and the sauce thickens up a bit). I've made this 4 times already in the last 2 weeks and I plan to make a bunch in advance to bring with me on our beach vacation. We love it!

These were great and the family loved them.  Next time, I will make some extra marinade to put on top of the chicken after grilling.

I thought this was a good marinade.  I did not think it was unbelievable!  I might use this again we all enjoyed it better with ranch.  I followed this recipe to a T but I baked it instead of grilling it but I dont see how this would completly ulter the taste.  On another note the marinade did smeel like a really good salad dressing I might have to try it on a salad some day.

I was less than impressed with this one.  The flavor was a sourish honey mustard.  Usually I agree for the most part with the recipe's reviewers, but not this time.  I won't be making this again.

This did not turn out well for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, and marinated my chicken for approx. 10 hours.  The chicken itself was moist, but the marinade added nothing to the flavor.  For such flavorful ingredients, I was really expecting more.    I'm obviously in the minority here, though, so maybe I did something wrong.  In any case, I don't think I'll be making this again.

I don't mean to be a party pooper but I was unimpressed with this.  Flavorless, is the best way to describe my experience.  I'm shocked at all the other reviews.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved the chicken.  I had the chicken in the marinade for 8 hours ... may do an overnight "soak" next time for even more flavor.

Hmmmm....well believe it or not, we really didn't like this. It was too tangy and my husband said it tasted like vinegar to him. Due to a last minute change of dinner plans this sat in the marinade overnight. The Hungry Teen liked this okay and had seconds. It wasn't bad, but I won't use it again. Thanks.

So far so good, I just mixed this marinade up to use overnight for grilled chicken tomorrow and if it tastes as good on grilled chicken as it does right now, I can't wait! Literally I could almost drink this LOL, I'd probably be sick, but it is yummy. Made a few changes but nothing major......I doubled the recipe, didn't have fresh limes so just used lemon. No course ground mustard so used Dijon and only have thighs and drumsticks in the freezer with skin on, so that is what I'll use. After Father's Day lunch tomorrow, I'll update on chicken flavor, but again, so far so good! **For some reason, I've ended up with two profiles on here, one with my other reviews and pics, the other w/o...have to fix that later.  Update:  After marinating chicken overnight, we grilled it last night and it was good.  Due to the oil in the marinade, the skin of the chicken burned and therefore, the taste of the marinade was lost.  I'll use this again on boneless skinless chicken and may even blend it in a processor and use it as a dressing for salad because I LOVED the flavor by itself.

Very good. We liked the marinade enough that we heated the extra and poured it over the chicken. Will definitely make it again, and try the sauce on pork and maybe salmon.

Very good...nice citrus/mustard flavor with the nice acid bite of vinegar.  Couldn't grill because of rain and were perfect under the broiler.  Will definitely make again!

I wasn't sure what to expect with this. The coarse ground mustard smelled awful (I never used it before) as did the marinade itself. Happily, the result was fantastic: moist, tender, delicious flavor. My family agreed that it was the best grilled chicken I had ever made.

This is a delicious marinade for chicken breasts. I baked the chicken with its marinade (425 degrees for 45 minutes. The result was succulent and moist with a bit of crust. I removed the breasts to a serving dish and discarded the remaining juices. Next time I will add a few herbs but the recipe is excellent as is.

My husband loved this recipe.  I did what other people said and put it in a baking dish so the liquid would not leak out.  I also used boneless pork chops and I cut the butter and olive oil in half.  The next time I cook this I will probably still cut them back even more.  There was a huge pool of oil and butter left over.

Wow!  This is going to be my new "Goto" marinade recipe.  The flavors are tangy, citrusy, sweet ... just divine for summer.   The next time I make this I'll go ahead and make a 2nd batch to keep in a Kerr Jar in the fridge.  I might even use it as a salad dressing or dipping sauce.  This one is a winner

I made this recipe just as given and was not that excited about it.  I did grill on the barbecue but it was not to my taste.  I was expecting alot more flavor and it just didn't meet my expectations. Not something that I will make again.

This was delicious.  Made just as written.  Next time I will try what other reviewers wrote about saving some marinade, before putting raw chicken in, and putting some on my chicken to add flavor when done cooking.  I loved the smell of the marinade and would like to have more of it on my chicken next time.  May also experiment with 2 pieces and  baking it in a pan, while grilling the others and seeing how it comes out so I can make it during the winter.  I served this with rice pilaf and sauteed zucchini, yummy! I will be using the leftovers for some yummy sandwiches!

Very good.  I prepared the recipe exactly as written because I don't think it is fair to the submitter when people don't rate recipes fairly.  I was expecting a little more WOW factor when I tried my first bite.  Not a huge taste but a subtle citrus flavor that left the chicken very, very moist.  Kids cleaned their plates!

this was amazing!! i let my chicken marinate over night and throughout the next day as well and it was so flavorful. i burnt my chicken just a tiny bit though. next time i might poke the chicken with a fork a few times so the marinate can soak in even more. this was sooo good i wanted to drench everything (including my potatoes and green beans) in it. i might make a separate bowl of it next time so i can use for other things.

WOW! This is by far the best chicken I have ever cooked or eaten. I let the chicked marinate for 48 hours then cooked it on an outdoor grill. It was so juicy and flavorful. I can't wait to use the leftovers for lunch!

This was very tasty except I didn't have chicken so I used the marinade on pork chops, next time I'll do chicken and I'm sure it will be just as good also I didn't change a thing. I also used the grill. The whole family loved it and that's all that counts.

When you use words like "unbelievable" to describe your recipe, you're asking for someone to disagree.  I thought this chicken was pretty good... but not unbelievable.  Knowing we don't care for overly sweet food (and knowing that sugary marinades tend to burn on the grill) I reduced the amount of sugar by half and left the other ingredients the same.  This created a spicy, sweet/tart marinade that was quite good.  I saved about 1/3 of it (refrigerated) and marinated 6 chicken legs (our personal favorite) overnight in the remaining 2/3.  I grilled the legs quickly over direct heat and then moved them when they were nicely marked, to the cooler side of the grill with the lid on.  Temped to 165*, I pulled them off the grill and soaked the hot chicken in the remaining marinade while I set the table etc. (This is a trick I picked up from Alton Brown... and it works!) By soaking the cooked chicken while it cools a little, the meat picks up more flavor.  The chicken was very good, served with red potatoes fried in a cast iron skillet on the grill.  It was good... flavorful... but not unbelievable.  With my 2 changes, I give it four stars.  Thanks for the recipe!

I enjoyed this chicken but wouldn't call it "unbelievable". It was good, but my 25 year old son said he would have preferred his BBQ'd instead. Husband said he liked it, but I was expecting more from the name.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and let it marinade over night.  I threw this on the grill and was really surprised by how tastey this was.  I never really like plain grilled chicken but this actually had a nice flavor!  My bf and my 5 yr old daughter also liked it.  I will absolutely be making this again.

This has quickly become a family favorite.  Remember to allow the chicken time to properly marinate.  Chicken is tender, juicy and the medley of flavors is perfectly balanced.  While on our Hawaiian vacation, we would grill this up for dinner and would always have to share the recipe with the other condo guests!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I only had an hour to marinade, and it was still very juicy and tasty. Can't wait to try again when I have longer to marinade to make the flavors even stronger.

This was my very first time grilling chicken and it was a big success! :)I put the marinade in a ziploc bag and marinated my chicken overnight. The only changes I made were I subbed garlic powder for fresh garlic and bottled lime juice for freshly squeezed. I grilled 7 minutes per side and it was slightly sweet, really delicious. I will definitely make this again!

This truly was "Unbelievable Chicken!" I love the marinade and served it with "Black Bean and Couscous Salad." I would like to use the marinade someday for Carne Asada. I marinated for 4 hours and baked 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Great recipe!

I printed this recipe off based on the ingredients and stars....but didn't look at the prep instructions.  Of course when it came time to make dinner I didn't have time to marinate it for 8 hours nor was I going out in the snow to grill the chicken. In essence what I did was marinate partially frozen, boneless skinless chicken thighs in the marinade for about 4 hours.  I think removed the chicken and placed it in a pie plate and baked it at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.  The chicken was moist and extremely delicious!!  I served it with roasted baby potatoes and steamed broccoli,  This will become a regular dish in our house.

This is a great recipe. It is important to let this marinade 24 hours. We usually cube chicken before marinading and then make kabobs on the grill.

This is truely "Unbelievable".  Very easy, juicy, DELICIOUS.  I like to double the marinade, reseve half, heat and serve over the chicken.  It is also excellent in chicken tacos.  Thanks for a great addition to my never fail recipes.

Had an overall good taste. I didn't grill, but baked in the oven at 350 for 35-45 minutes. Turned very tender and had a sweet taste similar to teriyaki. This chicken recipe was good, but not unbelievable.

I made this with chicken tenders and used bottled lemon and lime juice and it was fabulous.  I recommend making extra sauce for dipping afterwards.

UNBELIEVABLE. This is a great marinade- especially when you let it sit overnight.  I also fork holes in my chicken to let the marinade seep in.  That makes this flavorful recipe even more delightful. I make it repeatedly and everyone loves it. I once tried modifying it a bit when I ran out of ground mustard, but that was a mistake.  So, my suggestion to anyone looking for a great chicken recipe is to try this recipe AS IS. Yummy!!

I just finished eating a cold leftover piece, and it was still good! Lots of flavor, kids liked the sweet/sour taste. A good variation for chicken breast. Will definitely add to my rotation. I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 3T of oil (6 seemed like a lot.) I did not grill the chicken I used an indoor no fail method I learned from my sister: In a pre-heated ovenproof pan, first sear the breasts for 1 minute on each side stovetop, then pop all of it into a pre-heated 400 degree oven for 17-18 minutes. Perfect every time!

Great marinade for chicken or seafood.  I have made this several times. It is perfect for summer grilling. The longer you marinate the better.

Suberb!! I could not believe that such an unlikely combination would yield such an amazing unique flavor.  I did not have a fresh lemon so I just squirted a bunch of lemon juice in and my lime was really dry.  Left to sit overnight and the following evening we had a wonderful BBQ chicken dinner.  thank you!

A big 5-0.  Was easy and delicious.  Served with baked potato and green beans. Would like a little sauce with it so could reserve some marinade before marinating maybe, cook it in a saucepan and serve alongside.

I used a whole breast, leg and thigh and a small batch of the marinade. Marinaded it probably close to 24 hours. I thought I had brown suger but didnt so i squirted some syrup in it, a little cinnamon and some white sugar instead.. Then I couldnt help it I had to put red pepper flakes and cayenne and hungarian paprika in it because i love everything grilled hot.. everything else was the same but i also couldnt help myself from bbqing it without tasting it the way its supposed to be first. Man this chicken was awesome, i used sweet baby rays on it. I even burnt one side of the breast a little.. ok alot and it didnt dry the meat out. It did give me the runs though.

5 star chicken marinade recipe...very easy to prep. Family loved it. Used it on boneless chicken breat marinaded overnight. MOIST is the word to describe this chicken. Only item I didn't use was the lime as I didn't have any. Didn't appear to make a difference. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked the way the flavors melded together. I don't have a grill, so I just cooked the chicken cut up in a skillet, and it still came out great!

I made this for a small party we had which included 2 kids. One of the kids told me that he doesn't usually like chicken and that this was great. (Coming from a 10 year old you know you are hearing the truth). Everyone was asking for the recipe by the end of the night. I didn't change the recipe at all and I don't think it needs any tweeking.

Excellent! I had pork chops to use and poked them a few times with a fork before marinading them for 24 hours. They were so flavorful and moist. So tasty! I didn't have a lime so I just used lemon and used balsamic vinegar instead of cider.

This chicken is moist and flavorful.  Its a wonderful change from BBQ chicken.  It cooks up nice and easy as well.  I was careful when cooking it on the grill...I got my grill marks first then moved the chicken to the flameless side of my grill to allow it to cook without being over so much heat.  I didnt want it to burn.  I basted with the marinade every 5 min and a wonderful glaze appeared.  I also used the marinade on zucchini and vidalia onions as they were being grilled.  They too turned out delicious!

This was really good, and a good base to work with if you're missing some ingredients (like I was!).  I used chicken thigh/leg value-pak combo, so I then doubled the recipe so I had enough marinade.  I didn't have lime juice so I sub'd frozen limeade concentrate in and cut down a bit on the sugar because of it.  I used "Brat Mustard with Horseradish" as the mustard.  Even with those changes the marinade was very good.  I marinated for only about 6 hours but the chicken still had a good taste.  I did 'em on the grill and they really retained their moistness. The skin crisped beautifully and was delicious.  "Unbelievable?"  No.  Very very very good?  Yes.

This is our new favorite summer meal.  We used bone-in chicken and added Lawry's & red pepper flakes as others suggested.  We found that the meat needed to marinate overnight for best results.

i marinated the chicken for a few hours before broiling these with zucchini and red peppers for colorful and delicious shish kabobs.  the leftover chicken would be great sliced for tomorrow's lunch sandwich.

WOW! The whole family loved this chicken. The only change was I only used 1/2 the oil.  Saved a little of the marinade for basting.  Served with grilled veggies. Great recipe, thanks.

I saved the marinade, boiled it while the chicken was cooking, and drizzled more over the chicken before serving.  Awesome!  Served it with Thai Kitchen brand Lemongrass & Ginger rice and steamed sugar snap peas - it was an awesome meal!

I agree....this is unbelievable! The chicken was so moist and tasty, we couldn't stop eating it. My total marinade time was 18 hours and I poked holes in the chicken with a sharp knife to be sure there was flavor throughout. I served it with the Bodacious Broccoli Salad from this site along with onion rings and french fries (my son's request). A definite keeper!

This recipe was very tasty. Like others, I used dijon mustard and let everything marinate over night. It is a definite "make again" recipe. The whole family enjoyed it and I plan to add it to our regular summer repertoire.

This was  tasty! I will make again - I marinated 3 chicken breasts and made them into chicken kobobs to grill- I threaded them with onion, peppers and summer squash, but I forgot the pinapple and that would of made these even better tasting!! I have made a note to add pineapple next time!!  this is a great recipe and  I like the fact that all the ingredients for recipe  are on hand too!

Great recipe.  Big hit with my children.  I followed the recipe but only marinated for 8 hours.  I did poke the chicken so the flavor would soak into the chicken.  The chicken turned out moist and flavorful.  I've passed this recipe on to family and friends who are always looking for a great chicken recipe.  **I saved a portion of the marinate and boiled it on the stove until it was thick.  It was nice to have a little extra thick sauce for spreading on the chicken and for dipping veggies.

4 stars from me.  I marinated the chicken as directed (except only added 2 tbsp of oil) and insted of grilling, I decided to boil it stovetop style.  That way I could add all the  marinade and retain the flavor-some noted about loosing due to marinade time variation.  I added a cup or two of water (to boil out) and chicken cooked up wonderfully.  (I also used 2/3 reg musturd and 1/3 musturd powder, also used red wine vinegar, as well as lemon and lime juice from concentrate)

We all loved this- even the kids couldn't get enough!  Next time I'll make double the chicken, because it was gone fast and we were wanting more.  I used 1/4 cup olive oil.  This is so good!

This recipe really was "Unbelievable!!".  I will be making this a lot this summer.  We used a mix of breasts and thighs - and the thighs were extra good.

It was good, wouldn't say unbelievable. Tasted A LOT like the chicken satay recipe I made from this site. In fact my husband said if we had peanut butter dipping sauce it would taste exactly like it. Kids liked it. I cut the chicken into piece before marinating, marinated chicken for about six hours, placed on skewers to bbq.

I don't know if I'd call it "unbelievable", but the marinade was really good.  I think it would be good on shrimp too!  I'm gonna try that next time!!

A yummy change.  I made it for a group of people, it went over very well.  Next time, I'll reduce a bit the cider vinegar as I felt that taste came out the strongest.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a little sweet for us, and I even reduced the brown sugar.  Will probably try it again, and will reduce the sugar even more, and add some hot sauce.  It was good, not unbelievable.

Absolutely fabulous!  The marinate sounded and tasted strange at first.Please dont let this scare you. I was so worried that I had ruined dinner.  Turned out moist and good, husband LOVED as well.  I cut my chicken into strips and skewered.  BBQ'd them and they were great!!  defiantly will make again

This was not what I expected. All I could taste was the cider vinegar. I only marinated it for 8 hours. Very disappointing given all the good reviews.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I followed the recipe to the T and marinated the chicken for 24 hours and it turned out fabulous!  I don't have a bbq at the moment so I cooked the chicken in a skillet on the stove and just let it simmer in the sauce on low.  It came out juicy and super flavorful!

This is soo yummy!  It's winter now so instead of grilling kabobs I just used small chicken breasts (marinated the same way) and cooked them on the george foreman grill.  Really good...husband and 2 year old loved it.  My husband can't wait to try the recipe on kabobs in the summer!

This was pretty good.  The chicken came out very tender and pretty flavorful.  Next time I would probably reserve some of the dressing (before marinating) to drizzle over the chicken once cooked.

YUM! Fantastic way to flavor grilled chicken! Great for a dinner party or cook out. I put the marinade and chicken into a ziplock bag, stuck it in the freezer, and then put it in the fridge the night before I wanted to grill it. This is going in the permenant collection!

I would agree that this is the moistest, juiciest grilled chicken I have ever made!  I've never had much luck cooking chicken breasts at home - they always end up dry.  However, I thought the flavor was extremely bland/unmemorable.  I actually ended up marinating this for 48 hours, so I would have thought it would have been extra flavorful.  I was surprised that it wasn't.  I thought the marinade was interesting and flavorful when I mixed it up, but the flavors did not carry through to the final cooked product.  I'd give this a 5 star rating for juiciness but only 3 stars for taste, thus the 4 star rating.  I'd be willing to try this recipe again, with some additional ground mustard and other spices to jazz up the flavor.

I have had this recipe in my box for a while just waiting to try it.  Now that I have, I would have been better off just waiting.  This was pretty poor!  I expected super chicken and we just weren't impressed at all with the flavor.  Very sweet with little to no citrus or garlic flavor.  I won't make this again.

good recipe...marinated chicken overnight and ended up boiling in the marinade (don't have a grill).  Good flavor, the aftertaste is really great.  Nice and tangy.  Will make again, thanks!

Very Good!! omg, at first i was a little bit worried about vinegar and lemon and sugar... i usually prefer to marinate with white wine, but it was worth trying this time!!. i only used one chicken breast half (just me!! =( nobody at home likes chicken...) and made a few changes: added 1/2 teaspoon red pepper, forgot lemon juice, cut down on oil and used dijon mustard. Next time i'll cut down on sugar 'cause my chicken was too sweet for my taste, probably that was my fault since i omitted the lemon juice!! Oh, i only marinated the chicken for 3 hours and it still came out tasty!!!

Oooh, this was amazing, it definitely deserves the name unbelievable. I cut the olive oil in half, and only used 3 chicken breasts (just hubby and me), but left everything else the same. This would be really good on fish too.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I didn't have enough mustard and had to substitute the cider vinegar for red wine vinegar and the limes/lemons for lemon concentrate.  I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs and cut down on the oil (only used a couple of tbsps) as suggested.

Next time I'm definitely going to make sure I have enough mustard and use fresh limes to give it more zing!  Great recipe.

I was disappointed in this - a lot of trouble for little payoff in flavor. Chicken tastes the same when I just throw it on the grill plain.

wish i could give it 6 stars. do not overcook the chicken (i use kabobs and 3-5 min per side), I grill and make sure it's hot enough to carmelize the sugar, expect a small black spots. My picky familiy loves them - you gotta try this recipe!

Either I really messed this up (entirely possible) or this is just not our thing. It just tasted sort of funny. Sorry to not be more specific, but we really couldn't pinpoint the flavor malfunction in this marinade.

Wow this is really good!  The chicken was so tender and juicy.  Everyone thought it was delicious.  Next time I think I will use chicken with the skin, since I prefer to grill chicken with the skin on.  I will also try using this for kabobs like another user suggested.

I cannot believe I did not like this. I thought for sure with a 5 star rating. Can we say bland? I marinated it 24 hours and still barely any flavor. I will not make again.

Chicken grills up moist and tender. Very flavorful and easy to make. Meat has a nice tangy to it without it being overbearing. Will definitely make again and again!

This marinade is delicious! I've made this recipe quite often and never have leftovers. The tang of the citus juices and sweetness of the sugar are wonderful. Be careful grilling because the sugar tends to burn quickly. Marinated overnight and made for supper, the chicken just melts in your mouth. Wonderful. Thanks, Ruthie

This recipe is wonderful! Easy, great taste and my picky kids loved it! I don't think it was too vinegary and, if marinated overnight, it practically melts in your mouth.

I marinated steaks in this instead of chicken - very good.  I'll try chicken next time.  I didn't have limes so I used a whole lemon and hoped for the best.  I worry about acids cooking meat before it hits the grill, so if I was going ot marinate this one overnight I'd probably leave the vinegar and citrus juices out until the last half hour of marinating.  Good recipe.

This was wonderful! I was only able to marinade for approximately 5 hrs and it was still very flavorful so I can only imagine how much better it would be if I left it to marinade overnight.  Great recipe!

Wonderful flavor!  The entire family loved it.  Be sure to reserve a bit of the sauce to pour on top (I didn't and my chicken was a bit dry from overcooking it).  This recipe is a keeper!  Didn't need to change a thing.

Sooo good! I was initially distrustful of the unusual combination of ingredients - but it's the very same combination that makes it so delicious and unique. This was a delightful surprise...and a definite keeper!!!!!!!

Very easy to make and I was suprised that all the weird ingredients made the chicken taste so flavorful! Watchout from over marinating - the second time I made this I marinated it too long and the chicken ended up being tough.

Good but not great. I didn't find it tangy enough, but to be honest I didn't let the chicken marinade more than 6 hours. I'll try it again marinading 12 hours.

This went together quickly and I had high hopes considering all the five star reviews.  I let it marinate overnight, almost 24 hours.  It was only average though.  There are lots of other better marinade recipes out there.

UNBELIEVEABLE is a good word.  This was delicious and my family plus company loved it.  I DID give out the recipe like she said.  I used a spicy mustard.  This is a recipe that I will use again and again.  I made hashbrown casserole, fruit salad and tossed salad with this and it was a big hit.

I had high hopes for this after reading all the rave reviews. However, out of the three of us, none liked the marinade. The mustard flavor took over all the other elements of the marinade. I guess I have to put it down to personal preference but we won’t make this one again.

Flavor was great. I did it in the oven and could have cooked another 2-3 minutes. It was cooked through but some pieces were a little on the tough side. 
Definitely recommend it.

This had a  mild but unique and good flavor. So I wouldn't pair it with something overpowering or it will take away from this marinade. I did not grill them, I fried up small chunks of chicken on the stovetop in oil and left over marinade. I will make again.

I made this recipe exactly as written. No changes and no substitutions. It's awful. Weird flavor, watery, and somewhat bland. My husband, who is NOT picky at all, said it was disgusting and asked me to never make it again. It's called Unbelievable Chicken because it's unbelievably awful.

Super delicious! I don't have a grill so I baked the chicken breasts then super heated a pan until smoking and blackened the chicken 1 minute on each side.  I reduced the left over marinade and chicken juices (from baking) into a glaze which was an ultra flavourful and a delicious addition!  I chose to stuff my chicken with jalapeno Monterey Jack cheese which was ok but I'm thinking next time I'd like to go with a sharp aged cheese if I stuff again.

Great. I used only three chicken breasts and cut them in large cubes before marinating to create more surface area to drink in the marinade. I marinated for 24 hours and could even go longer. I put the cubes on skewers and cooked them on my indoor cast iron grill plate on the stove. I also took small baby bella mushrooms, cubed tri colored peppers & cut onion slices. Before I cooked the chicken skewers, I coated all veggies with olive oil and seasoned with all season salt and cooked on skewers. I put the same vegetables on the same skewers for even cooking. Next time I may take a little of the marinated and use it to marinate the veggies in a separate bowl.

It came out good one time.

The first time was delicious. After that, I followed the recipe to the letter and all I can smell and taste is the apple cider vinegar.

It was a pretty tasty recipe. The smell of the cider vinegar threw me off quite a bit but couldn't smell it at all once cooked. I would poke holes into the chicken so it could marinate through the inside as well or even slice it thinner.

I didn't have any cider vinegar, course ground mustard or fresh lime or lemon.  I used regular vinegar, regular yellow mustard and bottled lemon juice. I also only marinated 3 hours but cut the chicken up into strips.  It still had good flavor and we liked it.  Next time I would use fresh lime, lemon and marinade it longer.  I also boiled up the marinade and poured some on top of the cooked chicken. I used my George Foreman grill to grill it.  Good recipe.

Good flavour, but no reason to discard the sauce.  Boil it well, chop up chicken, add sauce and chicken to cooked rotini.  My kids loved it.

Marinated for 3 hours - used 2 T of sugar as I am more of a savory person. It was really good. Will make a gain for sure. Marinated cubes for brochettes.

When the chicken was done I took it off the grill and put spinach leaves and melted shredded Italian cheese on top. It was delicious, tender and juicy. It will be a stable for summer bbqs.

This is a weekly dinner at my house. Everyone likes it, it's easy to cook, both on the grill, and in the broiler. The leftovers are either lunch, or another dinner for one.

Best marinade for grilled chicken by far! So simple yet so delicious. Keeps the chicken moist even if your grill is on high heat.

Really nice marinade.  Used it for bone in, skin on breasts.  I like these best on the grill, bone and skin helps to keep the chicken moist.  The marinade added lots of nice flavor.  I used my tailgate gas grill in January in the UP (MI).  Love to grill in the winter - to bad more neighbors weren't outside to smell the aroma and get jealous!!  Thanks

My daughter puts ketchup on just about everything, and she didn't with this! I just threw it in a fry pan, it browned up beautifully, and was soooo good! I will be trying this marinade on a pork tenderloin maybe.

I’ve made it multiple times. It’s my go to recipe for chicken marinade. Sometimes I add soya sauce but it’s really great without it too.

This was delicious! My picky son ate it and wanted 3rds! I used boneless breasts that I cut into tenders before marinating. It was a huge hit and a nice break from our typical go-to marinade.

Made it as directed, loved it!  My daughter asked that I name it so she knows what to ask for. Cooked perfectly on the grill, beautiful grill marks and caramelization. We like everything spicy so I will add a little heat next time!

There is something about the combination of these ingredients that is so good. It’s easy and simple to make. I used chicken brest tenders. Placed them in a 9x13 pan and poured marinade over top. Let sit in frig for 1-2 hours, then place in a 350 oven for 45 minutes. Really good and easy.

It is unbelievable!!!  I set aside some of the marinade, as suggested by a previous reviewer.  Such a great idea! I do that  now for all the marinades I use to grill.  It makes a big difference in the taste.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and the tip!!!

The first time I made this chicken I let marainate over night and next day, then had to do it in the oven (torrential rain storms).  It was good.  The second time was done on the grill and OMG, it was wonderful.  Nice and moist and tender.  Followed recipe exactly!!  Will be making again, and again!!

My family and I loved this. We let it marinate for more than 24 hours (made the marinade in the early afternoon, then let it sit overnight & had it for dinner the following day). Incredible as written!

I thought that the marinade was absolutely delicious. In fact so much so, that I warmed a small amount and used it as a sauce for my chick.  I'm alone and I don't care for breast, so did wings which I fried.  I halved the ingredients and used less sugar than stated.  I intended to throw the marinade out, but decided to keep it, and I have now put a piece of salmon in it for to-morrow.  We will see how it goes.

I’ve made this many times and it’s become a family favorite.  It tastes just like the Hawaiian Chicken dish that was on the Steak and Ale menu. I also marinate fresh  pineapple (separately) to grill.

Made this exactly as listed, I used a cut-up chicken and marinated it two hours, put it on the grill and 35-40 minutes later it was great! Plenty of flavor and not over powering.

Didn’t realize this marinade is for 6 half breasts. I usually do not cook 2 at a time. Next time I will portion out the marinade to save it for next time. Delicious chicken and I can foresee using this often.

Super easy and delish! I had all ingredients on hand and used bone in breasts and thighs. Huge hit with kids and hubby and made excellent chicken salad the next day with leftovers. Keeper!

This turned out excellent. A sweet apple vinegar taste. I wish I had a grill then I think it would have been even better. I just pan fried it.

Can't give a good review of this one.  Sorry.  I like mustard, mustards - all I've triied - but this really tasted like mustard & mustard.  I'm thinking it would be good with some ham & cheddar on a bakery bun.  That would lessen the mustard taste & compliment the ham & cheese.  'Could be wrong.  It happens.

This has a very unique flavor to it and everyone enjoyed it.  You can really taste the fresh lime...it's tart and sweet and savory all at the same time.  I didn't have time to marinade and we don't own a grill, so I baked it in the oven.  I also used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  Next time, I hope to have time to marinade and I bet the flavor will be even stronger.

I used  chicken breast tenderloins and cooked it in a skillet with a little olive oil and lots of the marinade.  Delicious.  The secret is not to overcook.  I discarded the marinade that wasn't cooked.

I marinated this about 6 hours and cooked it on the grill.  Great flavor, easy clean up.  My son took the leftovers to work wrapped in a tortilla which worked great.  My family has pretty high expectations and this was a definite thumbs up.

Yes, it is! I was putting the marinade together for the chicken, when I decided it might be good for shrimp - and it was! I was making Chef John's Savory Coconut Rice, and thought shrimp might maintain the "tropical" flavor. The next night I used marinated chicken to go with the leftover rice - outstanding! The lemon and lime are wonderful. (Actually, the coconut rice wasn't quite to my liking, so I reheated it by steaming and added a generous amount of minced preserved lemon strips. Now that was good!) 
I usually cut chicken into roughly thumb size pieces, rather than leaving the breasts whole - the meat goes a lot further, and the chicken has more flavor in each piece. And, I leave some in whatever sauce or marinade I'm using, and only saute the amount I need, fresh, for that night's meal.  I still have chicken waiting in the fridge - it just gets more and more tender, and cooks up in a flash!
This is really good!

We have made this for years, as it comes originally from a book by NY food expert (deceased) Lee Bailey's book, "Good Parties", which is an awesome collection of recipes with suggested menu groupings. 

This makes great kabobs as well, and marinates more quickly if you cut up into kebab sized pieces first. 

We usually marinate this at room temp overnight, then leave in the fridge for at least a day, and package and freeze a pair of breasts in individual bags for later single meal use. 

I can't think of another marinade I would want to even try, as this one is so good, and always gets rave reviews from guests.

The book has a recipe for warm potato salad to go with this, along with a cold green soup. Highly recommend all of Lee Bailey's books, although mostly out of print now.

Wow!!! My husband loved it and he is usually a salt and pepper only kind of guy!!  I used thighs, and didn't have cider vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead. Juicy, sweet, tangy, the charred pieces were heaven. Going in the use this frequently recipe bin!

I am rating this 5 stars because it was easy to make the marinate, easy to grill and the chicken delicious in taste. The recipe was followed exactly except that I did use chicken thighs because they are what I had.

Super easy & really delish as is. The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly & marinaded it overnight. My 17 yo son HATES grilled chicken & he ended up eating 4 breasts! 'Nuff said!!
The 2nd time I made it I used 4 Tbsp (1/4 c) olive oil  instead of 6 Tbsp for ease & to reduce fat content. We didn't notice a difference.  I only marinaded it for 6 hours.  
If there are any leftovers, they made a nice addition to a green salad for lunch or dinner the following day.

I followed the recipe exactly, except the marinating time. I was only able to marinate it for 6 hours because I started it late in the day. The chicken tasted amazing! My whole family loved it. Next time, I'll try marinating overnight. I think it'll taste even better that way.

This recipe deserves its name!!!! Give it plenty of time to marinate and you will have the juiciest and tastiest chicken ever. I didn't cook it when planned and so froze it with the marinade. Later when we finally tried it, we agreed that it is our new go to recipe for chicken breasts done on the barbecue.

The marinade was very flavorful and everyone loved it.  That's not always the case in our house, as hubby prefers dark meat.

Delicious grilled flavor. I was uncertain about what exactly coarsely ground mustard was... so I reduced to 1 Tbsp of your standard ground mustard. - all else the same.

Great marinade! I double the garlic and cut the brown sugar by a third.  If you get a good char on the chicken it really makes the marinade stand out. So good!

I made this pretty much exactly as written except I broiled it instead of grilling it. I also marinated it for about 24 hours. It turned out wonderful. The boyfriend usually wants some kind of sauce to go with his chicken but he loved it and said it was so good and tender it didn't even need a sauce. Though I saw some reviews say they saved the marinade which I might do next time for even more flavor.

Followed the recipe ingredients exactly but used boneless chicken breast cut into strips.  Marinated about 6 hours before grilling on skewers. Very tasty!  A little tangy & sweet at the same time.  A nice change from an ordinary marinade.

It's true what they say, this is really good. I've made the marinade several times now, without alterations. Once I did add fresh squeezed orange juice, because I had an orange lying around that needed to be dealt with. I followed the advice of a few reviewers and cut my chicken breasts into chunks, marinaded overnight, and grilled in a basket with assorted bell peppers, onion, fresh pineapple chunks and mushrooms. Deconstructed kebabs, super good. Served it over coconut rice made in the rice cooker. Everybody loved it! This past week I used it to marinade country style boneless pork ribs, which was also tasty.

I did as some others and used Dijon mustard.  Mixed up the marinade and poured over chicken that I placed in a glass baking dish. (I don't grill!)  Baked at 350 til done and it was good.  I will make this again.

Very good! I marinated both chicken breasts (like the recipe calls for) and thighs overnight. If I had judged by the taste of the chicken thighs I would not have made this again, it was just "okay". But the chicken breast had great flavor. It was funny because I took a thigh and my husband took a breast...halfway through the meal I was like "It's okay, but I don't feel the need to make it again." He seemed really confused and bummed out...so I tried the chicken breast and realized why. I will definitely be making this again. My daughter used the leftovers chopped up in a wrap the next day and said it added great flavor to that as well. 
Thank you for the recipe, it's a keeper.

Truly the best BBQ chicken marinades I've ever tasted.My family of five, plus an additional 3 guests all raved about the flavor and moistness of the chicken. Followed recipe to a "T", except I doubled it. I marinated overnight and let sit at (a cool) room temp for 20 mins before transferring to pre-heated hot grill. Something I did that I usually wouldn't do.... there was so much lovely marinade left over, I immediately stored it in  a glass jar (while chicken was cooking)  and refrigerated. Next day I bought more breasts and marinated with leftover sauce. We BBQ'd it the same way the following  night... no complaints from my group! :) p.s. I did toss the marinade after second go-around. I'll make this again!!! Thank you!!

I followed the recipe exactly, with no changes.  It was pretty good, but too sour, in my opinion.  Although I use apple cider vinegar frequently in dressings, it wasn't overly appealing in this marinade.  I probably won't make this again and will continue looking for something better.

I made this yesterday and made no changes to the recipe. The chicken was moist and delicious. I marinated it overnight, It was absolutely delicious.

This was very good!  Like many of you, I hate it when someone changes a recipe and I don't know what they're actually rating.   At the same time, on-the-fly modifications are part of cooking. So, I used the juice from a whole lemon (I hate wasting food). It started to pour rain right before dinner, so I cooked the chicken breasts on the stove top in some butter and olive oil. I marinated it for about 24 hours in the refrigerator.  It was tender and juicy and got a thumbs up from the husband. I served it with mashed sweet potatoes and lima beans.  I'll definitely make this again, probably taking the advice of others to cut the chicken breasts into cutlets to maximize the surface area. I don't think this marinade will disappoint you!

This marinade was a hit with my family. I ususally have to make 2 or more meals for my picky guys. All 3 of my boys loved it and were disappointed when it was all gone. I only had it in the marinade for about a half hour and it was still amazing. We will be having this again. I am also going to try the marinade on sirloin steak tacos. Delisious!

Since this was the first time I made I stuck to the original recipe.  This really is amazing, tangy with a tiny suggestion of sweet and very moist.  I am alway skeptical about things calling themselves "amazing" but this truly lives up to it's name!

I didn't marinate over night but for only a few hours the first time and 4 hours the second time. I thought it was pretty good and will be making it again!

This was really good.  The chicken was nice and moist.  Post brine I would re-season the chicken.  It needed a little more salt.  Other than that really really good.  Will make it again.

This chicken turned out amazing! I didn't follow the recipe precisely for a few of reasons: 1) This was one of my first attempts at cooking a meal for my family, 2) I didn't know the difference between coarse ground prepare mustard and the ground mustard seed from the store, and 3) I didn't plan ahead far enough so I only marinated the chicken for 2hrs. I used 1-1.25 Tbsp of ground mustard seed powder instead which was roughly equivalent to the 3 Tbsp of prepared coarse mustard. I also used a mallet to flatten my chicken breasts out some so they cooked more evenly and faster so they didn't lose as much of their juice and dry out. My wife and son both loved this chicken, and we will definitely be making it again in the future. It would seem like it would taste excellent in a nice salad as well!

This was definitely an awesome recipe! I only had three chicken breasts but used the same amount of sauce, and I'm really glad I did. The sauce adds all the flavor. I marinated it overnight and I think that also really helped with the flavors. Definitely will be making again!

I have made this recipe several times and a few different ways, depending on what I have on hand. When you follow the recipe exactly, it makes a really delicious and juicy piece of chicken. I like to add a couple teaspoons of fresh ginger and use chicken thighs. It's super yummy and my family loves it.

I used dijon mustard since that's what I only have. Everyone loved it! I let the chicken marinate for 24 hours and grilled in the oven. I ate it with salad. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exactly as described except grilled the chicken in a cast iron pan and then finished in the oven.  They were big chicken breasts and took awhile to cook through.  The flavor was amazing.  I mixed most of the marinade ingredients in rough proportions to cook rice in as an accompaniment.  Also very tasty.  I would make this again for any poultry.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Broiled in the oven since the weather wasn't cooperating. Marinated them for about a day and a half. Very good! The house smelled wonderful!

This is AMAZING on my charcoal grill.I have a bad habit of not measuring, but I know it was close. I used chicken legs instead and added extra garlic and a little red pepper flake. I only wish I had made more...

The sweetness of the brown sugar, then the citrus are the predominant flavors, so if that's what you like you'll enjoy this recipe.

I've been waiting to try this recipe but haven't had time to marinate so finally was able to do it today. I made it exactly as written, marinated for 9 hours then grilled the breasts on the BBQ. So yummy! Husband loved it too so I will be making this again.

Good flavor but it needs a little more spice. Will add red pepper flakes next time. Also, I would cut the recipe down. It makes more than you need.

So good!! I was hesitant first because i couldn't imagine how all the ingredients would mesh together so i held back with certain things so as not to ruin organic chicken. I am making it again tonight and I'm not holding back on anything! Except the citrus that is, I'm only adding enough to help the marination process because i hate citrus flavored meat. This was a wonderful recipe and i feel like it will be added to the weekly routine! It ends up tasting sort of like teriyake minus the pineapple. Sweet and savory. Must marinate overnight though, don't skip it!

Pretty good, making the marinade had me doubting the taste of this. It turned out great, the brown sugar does a great job caramelizing the outer part.

I thought this was really good!  I doubled the recipe and reserved half to baste the chicken with while grilling.  Marinate overnight if possible.  I plan on experimenting with different mustards and vinegars.

This is amazing!!! My husband loves it! The longer you can marinate it the better!! The only thing I did differently was white vinegar and honey mustard instead of apple vinegar and brown mustard. Just be because of what was on hand.

This was great. I kicked it up a notch and smoked it. It turned out excellent. The only thing I would change is reduce the sugar but it was good as is.

I made this chicken today, it's light and tangy, I love it, it get s better with each bite.  I personally used less oil so it was a little less fat.

Delish and oh-so-easy chicken dish.  I used thigh instead as I find them moister.  Marinated a batch and froze to take camping, and a friend asked for the recipe.  When we returned home, I discovered we had both made the dish again a couple of days later - i.e. We couldn't get enough!

Followed the recipe exactly except it was raining outside so I couldn't grill the chicken, so  I broiled it instead. Definitely wouldn't call this "unbelievable". I don't think grilling it would have made it drastically better than how it came out in the broiler. I marinated this overnight and made it for dinner the next day, however, there was still not that much flavor.

Might be the best chicken I've ever had.    I only marinated for 90 minutes and it was amazing.  I can only imagine if I had marinated for 8-9 hours as the recipe called for.

Followed the recipe exactly, and this was really just so-so.  It could've been our particular course mustard.  The chicken had a nice zing, but it just wasn't what I had hoped for.  We might try it again with a spicier mustard.

Very tasty!  I didn't want to grill, so I baked these instead.  They were still delicious.  Next time I might try pan-searing or broiling instead.  As with most chicken recipes, I used boneless/skinless thighs instead of breasts - they can take much more abuse without getting dried out.

Followed recipe exactly. Chicken was moist and flavorful. A little heavy on the vinegar flavor (and I love vinegar), could have used a little more sweetness to balance

This was very good--a little sweet, a little tangy, and just a zesty perk-up for the same old chicken breasts. I had to sub Dijon mustard for the grainy mustard the recipe called for, and I didn't have any lemon juice so used all lime juice.  It was still wonderful. I think it would have been that much better with the grainy mustard.

I was super skeptical about using this as a marinade for chicken. The only reason that I even wanted to try it was because it had so many good reviews. I was not disappointed at all, I would not change one thing about this recipe ,it was perfect!!!!  I did not grill on the outside grill, I use the George Foreman grill inside,  it was still amazing! I cannot wait until the weather is better and I can grill out and use this marinade again!! Thank you so much!!

Made according to the directions.  Was surprised that it didn't have more flavor, even after marinading overnight.  Used all natural chicken breast, which in my experience absorbs more of the marinade because it's not shot full of water.  Made with roasted red potatoes and grilled broccoli.

This wasn't as highly rated by our family as I expected it to be. The only change I made was to marinade it about an hour and then cook it, in the marinade, in the oven--we live in Alaska and grilling season came and went. I used actual lemon and limes, so that wasn't an issue. If I make it again I will used less cider vinegar and add some spices to give it a little kick.

This has become our weeknight go to! I use light brown sugar instead of dark to make it a little healthier. I'm not very skilled on the grill so I bake the chicken at 450 for about 20-25 minutes and serve it with quinoa and broccoli. Low cal, healthy, and absolutely delicious!

I made no changes except for the marinating time. I only marinated it for 7 hours. My husband thought he died and went to heaven! I did too. Also, I used thighs. Cheaper and moister. Was wonderful.

I followed the recipe as stated but used the mustard that was in my fridge.  I'm glad the previous reviewers let me know about the burned look when you grill because of the brown sugar otherwise I would have 'thought' I was burning it.  All reviews indicated to NOT overcook.  I followed the instructions and went 8 minutes on a side on the grill and it was a tish dry.  Next time I will go 7 minutes per side.

This was a huge hit at my house - I didn't change anything except for using thighs instead of breasts due to our personal preferences. It's in the weekly rotation at this point.

This didn't really wow me.  It was good and the flavor was good but nothing spectacular.  I followed the recipe as instructed but I did add a tad bit more brown sugar for taste.  I broiled the chicken instead of grilling it.  I'm going to try to the grill next time as maybe that'll give it the flavor I was expecting.

DELICIOUS!  Our chicken was so juicy and tender, and the flavor is perfect!  It's sweet but not sugary, goopy sweet. It's has a good punch of flavor but not one that is overpowering. It's wonderful!  I can't wait for my husband to try it out, too!

This  was absolutely wonderful.  My husband and I followed the recipe exactly except we used Spenda brown sugar in place of regular brown sugar.  We will use this marinade for other dishes.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and let it marinade  the full eight hours.  I thought the result was very bland.  Everyone in the family ate it, but we all had to drown it in some kind of condiment.

When you name a dish "Unbelievable" it should be pretty amazing, but this wasn't I'm afraid.  It was very good though and I'll make it again but try baking it instead of grilling it.  This will help to retain more moisture and marinade which this needs imho. I'd also add a small amount of cayenne to give it some kick, doing so would work well with the citrus flavors.

I halved the recipe as I was only making 2 chicken breasts. Marinated for 8 hours. We thought the marinade was ok, I've made similar but better versions of this chicken in the past. Will not likely be making again.

This was a huge hit with our picky children.  I only marinaded it for about 1.5 hours instead of the 8 it called for and it still was great.  It's now in the regular round up of our menu choices!

Count me among those who will use this marinade again and again. I agree with reviewer Rita who said you can't taste the individual ingredients--the flavors meld into something unexpectedly delicious. I inadvertently let it marinate overnight, which may have improved the result even further. Maybe the lime breaks down the chicken a bit, and the flavors seep in more? I don't know the science, but man this was good.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!! I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars! It is unbelievably good. I needed to cook 32 pieces of chicken for a church supper so I trippled the recipe. I used apple cider vinegar, dijon mustard, jarred garlic  (never tried to mince fresh), & a little bit less than called for olive oil because I used all I had, and all the rest of the ingredients listed. I put it in a big pan & covered with saran wrap &  I made sure it marinated 8 hours. I've NEVER received so many compliments as I did on the flavor of this chicken.  It was moist & juicy. PERFECTION! Everyone asked what I put on it & I told them everything but the kitchen sink :-) My son even compared the flavor to Cracker Barrel's grilled chicken tenders.

I used chicken breasts and grilled them. They turned out good, but I really recommend saving the marinade for basting. Also watch your heat if grilling the brown sugar makes them prone to burning. Will be trying it again with a different cut and basting. I wouldn't recommend it baked the char from the BBQ really enhances the flavor.

EASY and AWESOME! We eat more chicken cutlets than anything and all three of my boys (18,18,21) rave about this chicken.  I hate when the chicken gets dried out on the grill, the chicken was moist! I've also baked it and it was very good too. I do like it better with the grainy robust mustard but it was also good with a honey mustard(all I had).

This marinade is fantastic. I have made it dozens of times as sometimes like to cut down the sugar in half and use it as a salad dressing on lettuce, cherry tomatoes, avocados, Spanish onion and cucumbers. I then slice up this chicken and put it on top. It's one if my favourite recipes!!!

Is is my go to chicken receipe for family dinners. Everyone loves it and unfortunately I've had to give it out so it is no longer just my secret awesome chicken. I usually cut the breasts into smaller pieces as it makes for tastier chicken.

This was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly. My husband cooked it on the grill and we absolutely loved it. Delicious with just a touch of sweetness. This recipe did not stick to the grill the way some recipes with sugar in them do. No need for nonstick spray.

Was simple to make and was quite flavorful!
Over cooked it a bit on the BBQ so it was on the dry side!
Family still liked it, will make a tasty chicken salad with the left overs! Will make again!

I made this recipe many many times with no changes and we absolutely love it!!!!! We've also marinaded the chicken for 2 days, which made it even more flavorful. And we've used the chicken for kabobs which is sooo amazing!!! Next I'm going to try changing the brown sugar out for palm sugar and see how that tastes.

We were tired of BBQ and thought we would give this a try. I made it exactly as described and it was great. The chicken browned up to a nice crispness and it was amazingly moist. 
I was surprised at how moist since I only marinaded for about an hour at room temperature.

This a good marinade. Made per recipe. I spooned it over the chicken until the last 2 minutes to get the mustard seed to stick. Used charcoal.

Outstanding grill chicken!! Very moist and flavorful. I made them for a 4th of July family get-together and received many compliments. My grill was not working, so I had to make them on my oven griddle. I will definitely be making these again??

I followed the recipe exactly--didn't think it had much flavor. I am still searching for the one best grilled chicken and best baked chicken recipe--this wasn't it.  It was "ok".

This is very flavorful chicken! I grilled mine on the George Foreman after marinating over night. This would be really good sliced and served on top of a salad.

The marinade with the chicken was delicious! I made it as is with the exception of only marinading for 3 hours instead of the 8+ hours. With a shorter marinade time, the flavors came through. I think it would be even better with a longer marinade time as directed in the recipe. Definitely a keeper in my recipe box!

Great mild marinade that made the chicken juicy with a great natural taste. Again, the whole family loved it. I accidentally used mustard spice instead of prepared mustard, and used lemon and lime juice slightly diluted since I didn't have lemons or limes. I also used rice wine vinegar instead of ACV, since I was out.

I made this tonight for the first time for company and it came out perfect and looked just like the pictures! I marinated it overnight and my husband cooked it on the grill. It had great flavor and was still juicy.  I'll be using this recipe a lot this summer!

Delicious marinade!  I vacuum sealed this marinade with sliced thin chicken breasts. I had intended on putting the meat on the grill, but we had an unexpected visit from tropical storm Bonnie. I put the chicken in the oven at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes. The chicken was tender and juicy. Once of the best chicken marinades I've tried.

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  We really liked the flavor and the chicken was tender on the inside and brown (and delicious) on the outside.  I kept the marinade cold in the fridge while on the chicken then heated it to boiling while the chicken was grilling.  I served it as a sauce for the chicken.  I will definitely be serving this for our dinners in the future.

I make this at least twice a month.  I love the chicken by itself or chopped up on a salad.  I usually add a touch of rosemary.

This is totally awesome.  I've made it numerous times.  I like to cut the chicken into skewer sized chunks before marinating -marinaded for 5 hours and it was perfect.

This is the best chicken I have ever had on the grill! I make the recipe as written, it doesn't need anything else. Looks gross when marinating, but I don't care because it is so good.

Doubled the recipe and went heavy on the brown sugar. Turned out great! Using the zest of both the lemon and lime significantly improves this recipe.

Outstanding marinade!  I am always on the prowl for a tasty yet healthy  marinade for chicken breast on the grill.  This is a keeper.  I did omit the salt, up the pepper to ¼ tsp. and cut the brown sugar in half to ¼ cup.  Of course, I always add more garlic too.  Note:  you do not need to marinade over night with this recipe, I did for about 6 hours.  Remember when using lemon and lime juice, it will par-cook the chicken a little. Don't over cook on grill either.  I grill on medium for 4 minutes a side and I time them---perfection!

It was good, but still believable. ;-) A little on the sweet side, but a lot of potential. I'll try again and adjust a couple things.

We were excited to try this recipe, but I have to say we were disappointed.  It was a mess on the grill and it didn't have as much flavor as other chicken marinades we've used.

This chicken was very tasty!  The only change I made was to use Dijon mustard as I didn't have the coarse ground kind.   Although I cooked it for 6-7 minutes per side on my grill, I thought it got  a bit overcooked.  Next time, I will make some additional marinade to serve as a sauce on the finished chicken.

I follow the recipe ...except instead of cider vinegar I peel and core 1 apple and  grate it then cook on 1 for about 20 min.  add that to marinade let the chicken sit o/n and it's amazing....They always ask for more.  I have made it with the vinegar ...It is good but like my opinion of  miracle whip I don't like the zip lol

Really enjoyed the combination of flavors.  I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours and it probably should have gone a little longer as recommended in the recipe.  I will definitely make this one again!

This is very good.  Baked it in the oven at 450 for 25 min, and used spenda for the sugar.  Turned out moist and tasty.  Will try to grill the chicken when the weather cooperates.

This is so easy to make and incredible!  Made really flavorful chicken!  I have made it a few times.  Once I tried it with margarita mix (I was out of lime) as another reviewer wrote and still loved it!  Wonderful marinade!

I made this because I love citrus and chicken together. However this marinade dried out the chicken a bit and I found the flavour somewhat plain. Not at all what I was expecting.

Finally a chicken recipe that is EASY for weeknight fast meal, that the whole family ate and liked.  I didn't change the marinade at all. I'm sure there are more exciting recipes out there, but this was easy, everything was on hand and everyone liked it.  So that in my book makes it a winner.

Unbelievable Chicken Haiku: "Ate mine with salad. On its own, bites were good. Didn't change a thing." I followed the recipe's ingredients and directions - marinated for 8 hrs., grilled my butterflied breast 6 min./side. The citrus flavor didn't shine as much as I would've liked - cider vinegar and brown sugar dominated IMO. I'm not sure I would've enjoyed the chicken as a protein entree on its own, but sliced over a salad it was tasty.

This was very good. It is definitely a keeper!! I boiled the marinade, added some cornstarch (dissolved in cold water) to thicken it. We only had whole chicken breast, so when done grilling we cut the chicken into strips and drizzled it with some of the boiled marinade...YUM! I got a lot of compliments.

I don't usually review recipes, but I had to for this one. This marinade is amazing and super easy to make.  I'm trying to eat more healthy foods, and this recipe was perfect. I paired it with half a baked potato and some asparagus. 

I marinated my chicken for 24 hours before grilling it. It came out juicy and delicious. I usually make one meal that will last me all week so I don't have to cook every night after work. I ate this four nights in a row and NEVER got bored of it. In fact, I'm making it again this week. It's that good!

I loved this recipe and will certainly make it again!  I did not marinade for a full 8 hours; I did about 4.  The flavor was amazing.  However, I cooked it on a Traeger Smoker with hickory pellots, so that may have improved the flavor.  I loved the recipe and would encourage people to try it, because it's delish!!:)

I made this chicken for my football draft today.  I thought it was good & I will be making it again.  I had several people tell me how good it was and 1 said "I've had chicken at lots of restaurants that wasn't this good".  I look forward to making it the right way as I added too much vinegar accidentally, but it was still good.

this was unbelievable! I started to marinate it, then we had a change of dinner plans, so it sat 2 days in the fridge. It grilled up juicy & flavorful. I pounded the chicken breasts to even them out for cooking, didn't change a thing. Served with a salad and some chicken flavored noodles from a box. Delish!

This was very good. Followed the recipe, except I grilled it in tin foil and then finished it on the grill. If you are looking for something low cal and good tasting, this is it.

It didn't have an amazing flavor. I did use a whole grain mustard but I think next time I would try one with better bite to it. I pounded the chicken first and marinated it overnight. It came out very tender and moist so it was well cooked.

Mmm chicken candy. I've never tasted chicken packed with so much flavor. Will definitely keep making this recipe. One thing that differed in my marinade was I used prepared smooth yellow mustard, because the only grainy mustard I had was Dijon...and I'm not a huge fan of that flavor, especially with so much in the recipe.

This recipe kept the chicken from getting dry. Flavor was a little lacking but very good

Like some others, I felt this was a basic starter recipe.  Felt it was kind of plain tasting before I marinated the chicken, so I added about 2 teaspoons of ancho chile powder and some red pepper flakes. The grilled result was good, just not "unbelievable."  No one asked for the recipe, either.

Made this last week for a barbeque with friends.  Everyone liked them a lot.  My Husband really loved it and has requested it for tonight. I did substitute spicy brown mustard since I did not have the course ground. I did marinate them overnight which I did so I would have less prep the day of the barbeque.

Absolutely delicious! Followed the recipe exactly but only had about 6 hrs to marinade and it still came out perfect. Used boneless chicken breasts which can easily dry out on the grill but these were juicy and tender. Flavor was perfect. Cut up an extra breast the next day, wrapped it in foil and warmed in the oven for chicken sandwiches and it was still juicy. Put it on a butter toasted bun with some honey mustard and I have now found our new favorite sandwich. Love it when a meal does double duty.

I was so excited about making this dish but once I started to mix in all the ingredients I was horrified by the smell. The chicken turned out great but the after taste it leaves in your mouth is disgusting! So if you don't like that dreadful taste in your mouth beware!!!

Served this chicken many times to lots of people and it never fails. Even my picky mom and best friend like it. You can bake it if you don't have a grill; it is still fantastic.

It is amazing and we make this meal all the time. We use chicken tenders and thighs. We also make zucchini and squash (grilled in foil) , boil the marinade and top it on the chicken and veggies. So delicious!

I made this recipe, and we all enjoyed it, for sure the chicken is moist as long as you don't cook it too long. I tried it in the oven and baked it at 375 for about 20 minutes and let them rest for a few minutes. Next time I will try it on the BBQ - It definitely is different, sweet and tangy at the same time. I didn't have the stone ground mustard so I used a bit of the regular mustard and it seemed to work ok. I will make this again but this time I will try it on the BBQ, it's good but not sure I would call it unbelievable.

I made this exactly per the Recipe and let it marinade for about 24 hours.  Everyone in the house loved it!  I served it with a mix of steamed broccoli and cauliflower with a cheese sauce.  :-)

This marinade is tangy, fresh, and sweet, and I love that it doesn't use soy sauce, which is so common in chicken marinade recipes. I didn't change a thing, marinated halved breasts overnight, and grilled them. The brown sugar component produces great caramelization when you cook the meat. If you use breasts, be very careful not to overcook--they will dry up in seconds. Test with a thermometer, or your finger, if you have that kind of skill. Also, I recommend reserving the remainder of the marinade, simmering it on the stove, and serving it as a pour-over or dipping sauce.

This was amazing! I followed exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. Next time we're going to do chicken and veggie kabobs. 

Update: made a second and third time - my kids love this grilled chicken! This time around I used splenda brown sugar substitute to make a bit healthier and rice wine vinegar as that was all I had on hand and we could not tell any difference. Also made a little extra marinade for veggies, grilled in foil pack along side the chicken while camping and served over rice. Delicious!

Very good and very easy. For precision, I used 2 tablespoons each lemon and lime juice, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and cut the oil down to 1/4 cup. I marinated overnight but next time I will flatten the breasts slightly to increase the surface area.

Made it for dinner two nights ago, and, wow, this was AWESOME!  I used skinless, boneless thighs (I think breasts are dry), marinated overnight and my husband grilled the chicken.  It even smelled great while it was cooking, and tasted even better!  I am already planning on making it again next week.  A definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a good marinade which I made as written. I found it a little bland which may be because of the oil diluting it, I am not sure the oil was necessary and I may omit it next time (or cut down) and resubmit my review. I also saved the marinade out of the fridge for basting but it was too thin and kept running off, which may also be because of the oil.

Very tasty! I added cajun seasoning to the chicken before putting it in the marinade. I used boneless thighs and only marinated for about 2.5 hours.

Everyone enjoyed this!  I reduced the brown sugar a bit (maybe by half), because my daughter complains if meat is very sweet.  I did more like 1/2 tsp salt because we're doing lower sodium, and a wee splash of reduced sodium soy sauce.  Everything else was as written.  My daughter took one apprehensive bite, and immediately wanted more.  :-)  There were no leftovers tonight!

I've made this twice. The first time as given...it was good. The second time I used margarita mix, the frozen kind, as another commenter suggested, and the juice of one orange, in lieu of the lemon and lime juice. I tasted before putting my pork chops in, and I liked it much more than the original. I actually made a second batch, and used it as salad dressing. I let the dressing sit all day and before using, strained out the garlic. I grilled the pork chops and sliced them and served on the salad. I will be using this for dressing and marinade again.

Even my picky eaters loved this. I made it exactly as the recipe states, except I doubled the marinade. After removing the chicken from the marinade to grill it, I poured the leftover marinade into a pot and boiled it for 5 minutes, then served it as a sauce for the chicken.

this was really a fantastic marinade.  I used it on bone in pork chops instead of chicken and it turned out great.  I used a small blob of honey, prolly about 2 tablspns, instead of brown sugar cuz that's what I had on hand.  I smoked them on our traeger for about 1 hour per side as they were pretty thick.  served them up with chef johns broken spaghetti risotto, and pickled sweet and sour beets, made with fresh beets just harvested.  all of these recipes found  on this site.  thank you, ar is fantastic.

I thought this recipe was excellent for the amount of work that goes into it.  It was easy, different and had the ingredients on hand.  I used regular prepared mustard.  Let it marinate for about 9 hrs and bbq for the recommended time.  Turned out great.  I boiled the leftover marinade to use on the chicken, very good.

I've made this recipe several times and it is "unbelievable" every time, no alterations, as is. Fresh juice is a must! I love the addition of the course mustard.  It adds a nice texture.  I also like to use the marinade on a half chicken (with bone & skin) and roast it in the oven. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I made this as written except I substitued creamy Dijon mustard because that was all I had on hand.  I doubled the recipe for 10 breasts.  It was very yummy. We have tried a huge amount of different marinades at our house but this had a different taste to it that was very pleasant. It has a  tangy/sweet taste.  It was a huge hit at our party and I recieved several requests for the recipe.

OMG!!!  I had all but one ingredient (substituting the cider for red wine vinegar) and it came out GREAT!!!!  This was a remarkable recipe and I will use it many more times to come.  Even tried it on the stove top by cooking until reduction of the juices and it came out even better.  Wow!  I am very impressed and so is my family :o)

I made this last night and it was great!  I followed the recipe as closely as possible without actually measuring the ingredients and marinated the chicken over night; I used tenders as that's what I had on hand.  I grilled it on skewers and the chicken was moist and tender and held all the rich flavor way more than any chicken I've marinated before.  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe and plan to use it again and again.  I think it would be especially good as a chicken to add to salads like a topping, or in a chicken salad concoction.  It has so much flavor you wouldn't need much to add to it.  Next time I'll make more for leftovers!

This was easy and delicious.  We all enjoyed the slightly-sweet, mustardy tang of the marinade and I especially liked the crispy-on-the-outside, juicy-on-the-inside results from the grill.  Thanks--this one's a keeper!

It was edible, but not good.  Too much brown sugar is what ruins this one.  Very sweet and surprisingly lacking the other flavors.  If I try it again I'll leave that out.

It reminds me of a salad dressing from one of our local restaurants and might be good that way.

This is an excellent recipe.  The marinade is very strong from the cider vinegar, but it doesnt taste like vinegar.  I grill the chicken in my George Forman Grille.

This is the best marinade I have ever had.  I omitted the lemon because I don't like lemon but aside from that I made it exactly like the recipe.  It was exactly the kind of marinade I have been looking for to replace a marinade they use to have at the store and have discontinued. AWESOME!!!!!

I thought this was pretty good.  I accidentally left the chicken marinating in the fridge for 2 days, but if anything, it only made the flavors better.  My husband thought it was unbelievable, as the name suggests.  I thought it was pretty tasty, but perhaps not unbelievable.

This is the Best chicken I ever had!!!  It tasted like I was eating a chicken dish from a restaurant.  Highly recommend it!! I was a bit skeptical as the vinegar smelled so acidic...but it turned out great! I marinated it for about 7 hours.

Quick, healthy and delicious.  What's not to like?  Didn't have grainy mustard, so substituted Dijon with great success.  I've saved it in my recipe box and I'll be making it again.  Thanks!

Fantastic! This truly is unbelievable, as well as versatile. I tweaked the ingredients only slightly, due to ingredients on hand and personal taste. Used only 1 tblsp mustard, and 1 tblsp each lime juice and lemon juice (bottled). Used boneless, skinless thighs. Baked at 350 for 15 minutes! Done! The perfect balance of sweet and sour, this recipe excites every taste bud. Thanks for posting it.

Didn't have all the indredients and it still turned out wonderfully.  Got rave reviews from DH.  Minor changes based on what we had: use 2 T. course-ground mustard and 1 T. dijon; used 1/2 an orange -- didn't have any lemons; decreased the EVOO slightly.  Very tasty!

Very easy, tasty chicken. I used chicken tenders, pre-cut, and marinaded for only 4 hours. It was still very flavorful and moist. This will become a regular on our grill!

AWESOME! I doubled the recipe and did everything the recipe said to do, and i added a few things of my own (2 tbsp Dakota Buckaroos Original Marinating Sauce, 2 tbsp Sriracha Chinese Hot Sauce bcuz we like a little heat, a tsp liquid smoke) My husband, an aspiring chef, closed his eyes to eat it! that's saying something for him!  
oh, i did use a little less sugar because i'm more into savory than sweet.  I doubled the recipe but used the same 1/2 c of brown sugar: just the right amount for me!  Will definitely be using again. 

WORD TO THE WISE: you do NOT have to discard the marinade!!!!!!!  you can put it in a pot and boil it hard - and i mean HARD to kill all that bacteria - and use it to baste your chicken.  Its like a homemade barbeque sauce.  It makes sense, when you heat the chicken itself, the bacteria is killed, so why not the marinade too?  Beautiful color and ridiculously delicious!  but if you're not comfortable (tho we've done this several times with no adverse effects) by all means discard the marinade, but you'd be missing out!

I was looking for something different and this is great.  My husband and son said this is the only way I am to grill chicken from now on.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used concetrated lime and lemon juice, but I reduced the amount I used and I also used Canola oil instead of olive oil.   I was asked to make this for a large family picnic.

This chicken recipe is the best I've tried in a long time. So easy and tasty.  I didn't have lime so I used all lemon.  I didn't have coarse-ground mustard so I used spicy brown.  I cut the chicken breasts into strips so we would get more grill marks all around.  It was excellent and the family raved about it.  Will definitely be serving this at my next picnic.

I have to say this is really good chicken, I made it as is, and marinated it for 2 days... I had unexpected guests the day I was supposed to have them, and it made them tender, juicy... sweet to the taste; a definite keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly, except for doubling the marinade (we're saucy people) .  It was truly "unbelievable"!  The entire family enjoyed it.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This was really good. Some have said they cut back on the olive oil. Olive oil is one of the good fats; it raises your HDL and is good for you.

This made a very good marinade.   I made the recipe exactly as written and marinated the chicken breasts for approx 10 hours.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The family thought it was very good and the general consensus was a rating of 4.

The BEST chicken marinade we have ever tried!  I didn't change a single thing, and it was amazing.  Even my boys ate 2 chicken breasts each.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good, but I think I should have marinated a bit longer.  I didn't realize it should be marinated for so long and I threw it together at the last minute.  The flavor was great though.

I was only able to marinated the chicken for 6 hours and it just didn't have the amount of flavor I was looking for.  I barbecued it and although the chicken was very tender, it just didn't take on the flavor like others I have used and marinated for a lot less hours.  I did like this recipe because it includes a lot of ingredients I generally have in my kitchen.

This chicken is the best!  I use it for everyday dinners, perfect for a big group and the one recipe I share constantly.  If you have any leftovers, it makes a truely awesome chicken sandwich.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did the chicken under the broiler instead of grilling it.  It had a very pleasant, mild taste.  I would definitely make it again.

This chicken is unbelievable!  I cooked it on the grill and tasted it as it was finishing - tender with great flavor. I always have trouble getting chicken to cook inside without 'blackening' the outside when cooking on my grill. Next time I make this I will use chicken cutlets!

Simple and delicious, even though I only marinated for about 2 hours.  I saved the marinade, boiled it, and then added some chicken broth and some butter to make a glaze.  Family loved it!

My daughter and boyfriend loved these, even though they are die hard beef eaters! I realized I didn't have any coarse ground mustard so had to use regular mustard instead, but it still turned out great! I followed the rest of the recipe exactly but marinated it for only 3 hours.  Next time I will try it with the right mustard!

This was really delicious - my boyfriend especially liked it! The taste is hard to explain...once you bite into it of course it is tasty, however, once you chew, the sweetness of the mustard comes out with all of the other ingredients and it is sooooo good. I def. recommend!

Before dinner, family and in-laws scoffed at the name, but one taste was all it took for them to agree!  This will be our go-to marinade from now on.  Smells great on the grill, too!

Best marinated chicken recipe ever! Everyone I make this for asks for the recipe. I found the longer I let it marinade, the better...up to 2 days!

This is my favorite chicken recipe. I don't really measure any of the ingredients, I just use whatever mustard I have on hand and I usually cut the chicken into chunks or strips before marinating but other than that I don't really make any changes. The marinade is so easy and adds a ton of flavor.

As one review stated, common ingredients uncommonly combined.  Tweak this to your heart's content, and it can only become better.  Loved this recipe.

I was skeptical because I don't like mustard, but I went ahead and made this anyway.  It was very good.  I made exactly as written except I didn't have 8 hours.  I only marinated for about 45 minutes and it still turned out wonderful.  Will definitely throw this together again.

Excellent! Made it exactly as the recipe directed and marinated it for about 10 hours. Took a bit longer to grill, but some of the moistest chicken I've eaten!

Very good marinade and appreciate the common ingredients. No special trip to the grocery.  Thinking of adding some crushed red pepper flakes next time to add just a bit of a kick.  Will certainly use this one again! Thanks.

This was really good.  The chicken was extremely moist.  The marinade really flavored it well.  I was worried about the amount of acid, but it ended up being fine.  I cut the chicken into cubes and cooked on the grill with skewers to make kabobs.  I was eating leftovers cold straight out of the fridge, and they were still moist and juicy.

We did not like this.  I felt that it was sour and strong taste of vinegar.  I followed the recipe exactly. Ended up throwing away the leftovers.  Sorry, but unbelievably disappointing.

I was skeptical when I smelled the sauce, but this chicken was very moist and tasty.  My usually picky 2 1/2 year old daughter liked it too- she even did a "happy dance" for it! I used dijon mustard, and 6 Tablespoons of lemon juice, since that's what I had on hand.  I just baked it in the oven at 350, and it was great! Thanks for a delicious recipe!

The chicken was delicious!! It turned out to be a little dry after marinating it for well over 8 hours.  I only gave it 4 stars cause the cider vinegar was just a tad bit overpowering in some bites, but other than that this dish is delicious!!

I used three chicken breast. Sliced them up, marinated for about 4 hours. Lightly sprayed pam on a large skillet and cooked with all juices until done. Used wheat buns, spread honey mustard and slightly melted swiss cheese  on the bun(placed each slice of cheese in microvwave for 7 sec) then put the sliced chicken on the buns. Family luved them!!!! Serve with french fries or honey bbq beans.

This was pretty good, but it's really nothing special and really the flavor wasn't as strong as I would've liked. I marinated for about 10 hours, but if I make it again will try it over night. Good marinade, but nothing special.

AMAZING!!  I rarely hand out five stars, but this one deserves it!  The ingredients create a wonderful flavor - so refreshing.  I cut my chicken into inch pieces, marinated, and cooked in a cast-iron skillet with the rest of the marinated.  Put chicken over a salad and used the marinade as the dressing.  Served with breadsticks.  Husband was very impressed. Thanks for a recipe that I will make again and again!

This recipe is aptly named and has become my favorite chicken recipe. The only change I make is that I only marinate the chicken for 30-45 minutes. It is WONDERFUL!

it was good but didn't stand out as spectacular.There's so many chicken recipes out there that I don't know if I'll make it again or not.

My chicken was about to expire and I had planned to use this recipe, but I forgot to marinate it. So, I pulled out all the ingredients, cut the chicken into strips, and sautéed it in the marinade ingredients. I didn't use the amounts specified in the recipe, I just kind of winged it. I also threw in a splash of soy sauce. It turned out SO GOOD. The "marinade" formed a delicious glaze over the chicken. I highly recommend trying it—the flavor had a lot of depth. (Sorry to all you die hard recipe purists who don't like reviewers who change the recipe. I read the reviews in order to find good changes for the original recipe!)

it was yummy, i let it marinate for 8 hours though it wasn't long enough i think for the flavor to fully absorb.

this was amazing!  I've made it several times and it's always a hit.  The kids loved it, too.  The chicken stays nice and moist marinating it this way - many times I find grilled chicken breasts to be dry and stringy.  I marinated mine overnight.

Flavor is amazing! I am not a fan of any type of vinegar (b/c I hate the smell)...but it works so well in this recipe! I did the same as another user and used 1/4 cup of margarita mix (sweet and sour mix) b/c I didn't have a lemon on hand. I put mix and chicken in a freezer bag for about 12 hours then grilled. Served with mashed potatoes, green beans, and bread.

This was really good!  I wasn't sure if this was going to be good with DARK MEAT, since everyone else's reviews were with breast.  BUT, it was very good with chicken quarters!  I put the frozen chicken quarters with the marinade for about 24 hours, so as it defrosted it was soaking up the liquids.  I grilled it over a charcoal grill on indirect heat for a while (20+ minutes, internal temp 165F).  The grill had smoking chips in it too, so it added a really delicious smokey flavor.  This marinade is great for BBQ's because it is yummy on its own, but it'll also complement BBQ sauce, for those who like that classic BBQ stickiness. Will definitely use this again for the next BBQ.  Thanks for the recipe!  (Other subs, prepared 3tbs prepared lemon juice, 2tbs prepared lime juice.)

Excellent marinade! I didn't have any limes in the house so I used a whole lemon. I also marinated thin cut boneless skinless cutlets because it was all I had in the house and I wanted to try this marinade. I baked the cutlets in the oven and then broiled them for 2 minutes and the end and they were soooo good! Excellent marinade, will use again :)

I thought this marinade had a great flavor but it didn't permeate through the meat like I thought it would.  I let it sit all day and even basted the chicken while it grilled.  Next time I'll let it set overnight and pierce the meat so it will have longer to absorb the flavors.

This is an easy recipe for a cook-out. I thought the flavor was great but this recipe didn't get any wows from my guests and my husband wanted to put barbecue sauce on it! So good flavor but I think the dish overall comes across as a bit plain for some.

This was wonderful! After trying the marinade on chicken, we decided that it was unfair to limit its use to just one type of meat. It's equally wonderful on bass, trout, and shrimp. Just be sure not to marinate your seafood for more than 30 minutes. Yum!

Extremely tasty and the chicken is always moist and tender. I made this recipe as is and paired it with wedge potatoes and broccoli. I can't wait to see what other kinds of meat and seafood this marinade would go great on. Wonderful!!

Really, really good.  I marinated overnight and the chicken was really tender.  It's not spicy or overbearing so leftovers would be great on pizza or in a sandwich or salad.  I think I will try this marinade on pork chops next.

This was great! I used quarters and some bone-in thighs. My pics weren't exactly yummy looking but the chicken was very very tasty. I marinated it overnight. Like most marinades the outside is great and the inside is just chicken but this had so much flavor all the way through. When I took it out to cook I was scratching my head thinking this smelt and looked funny but it was super! This will be a staple in our house for cookouts.

Very good. Followed exactly. Also added a little dried oregano, worchershire, and Cookies seasoning. I pounded out the chicken a little bit to make the thickness even. Put on a hamburger bun, topped with bacon, swiss cheese, honey mustard, & mayo.

This Chicken is unbelievable - unbelievably good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I set aside 1/2 of the marinade (which I did not put in with the raw chicken) and simmered it on the stove while the chicken was grilling.  I then poured the sauce on top of the finished chicken and it was amazing!  I was also only able to marinate the chicken for 2 hours and it still had plenty of flavor.

Great recipe! I omitted the salt from the marinade and just sprinkled on prior to grilling. I think maybe that was what may have dried out chicken that was mentioned on previous review, not lemon. I don't think salt should be added to any marinade as it draws out the moisture in the meat.

This is a very tasty marinade.  The chicken I made was very juicy and delicious.  (*HINT- try tenderizing the meat first with a Jaccard.) I think it would also be great on wild birds like pheasant and grouse- since these are generally drier due to the lower fat content.

This was a good marinade.  I only marinated for 7 hours and I think it would be even better if I had done it overnight.  This would be great with bbq'd veggies. :)

made this for a family bbq today, several picky eaters in the group.  everyone loved it, they raved!  the only thing I did slightly different from the recipe.. I marinated, but took about 1/3 out first & used it for basting on the grill.  YUMMMMY - this WILL be made again at our house!

I'd go with 4.5.  I loved the unique flavor this gave the chicken and my kids did too!  It's pretty strong and maybe too strong for some, but I'll make and enjoy it again.

So delicious!  The ingredients sound kind of strange but it works.  My 2 year old nephew kept asking for more and we have the worst time getting him to eat chicken (or any kind of healthy protein).  This one is a winner!

I liked it a lot, but the vinegar is a little strong.  Not a big fan of vinegar...it'd be a 5 if I liked vinegar!!!

I pounded the breasts down to about 1/2" an inch, and left them in the marinade for approximately 7 hours.  The marinade is sweet/on the honey-tasting side.  They were very good.

This recipe was a huge surprise to me, the flavor was awesome!!  Everything in it seems so basic, yet the taste is nothing but!  It tastes like something you'd order at a restaurant.  I will make this again and again.

I loved this recipe!  The only change was I actually used bottled lemon and lime juices, but have to assume it would only be better with real.

I think this was unbelieveable chicken.  You could taste each of the ingredients individually and they meshed together beautifully.  My son that doesn't like grilled chicken breasts really enjoyed it.  I will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

This was good, I wouldn't go so far as to say it's unbelievable.  Most marinades taste the same once the meat is cooked anyway, this was no different.  Good moist chicken, we enjoyed it.

Truly Unbelievable!  Grilled the chicken last night after marinating over night,  and it turned out amazingly well! Wow, the flavors just "do chicken right"! If you love chicken like I do, you really must try this recipe!

It was okay, but when it game down to it it was just grilled chicken with a glaze on it, nothing spectacular and kind of on the sweet side.

This was a very good recipe. It almost tasted like an Asian dish. It was sweet from the brown sugar and tangy from the mustard. The chicken was tender. This is good by itself or on a salad. It is cheap and easy. I will definitely use this often.

This a tasty marinade but I don't think it's "unbelievable" because it didn't cause me to pull a Meg Ryan in a sandwich shop!  The chicken was quite tender and definite crowd pleaser off the grill.  I may add some more kick to it as mentioned by a previous reviewer.   It is simple to make and it will make regular occurances in my household.

Very flavorful and very easy. I always struggle with chicken being too dry. I didn't even marinate as long as it called for, but it was great. I pounded to an even depth and seared it on my indoor press and it was fantastic.

I only had time to marinate the meat for two hours but it was still delicious.  The chicken had such a wonderful flavor and was vey juicy.  I will marinate longer next time to get more of the flavours into the meat.  I love this recipe as written, it is quick and easy.

Thought it looked like a good recipe so we tried it.  I followed the recipe exactly. It was wonderful, all of my 5 children loved it.  Also made it for a dinner party for 15 people.  Everyone said that they loved it and wanted to know what I put in the marinade.  The chicken turns out quite tender.  Love the fact that I prepare it the night before.  I also cut the chicken breast in half so it is easier for the kids.  We usually have it a few times a month.

Made this last night. My DH loved this chicken. This is a definite keeper. The chicken was juicy off the grill and kept for the hour and a half we had to wait for my DH to make it home. Served with grilled vegetables and brown rice. GREAT MEAL!

YUMMY - this recipe was perfect for a hot summer night's dinner.  The bold mustard flavor blended well with the light citrus flavors.  I will definitely be adding this to our "favorite" file.

I followed it to a tee and they came out delicious. It is important to use fresh lemon & lime since the bottled stuff isn't the same.

Very good. Maybe I grilled it a bit too long..some pieces were moist but others dried out. That's my fault, but it made it not a 5 star. Taste was great. Will do again.

I followed the recipe exactly with the one exception that I did use one reviewer's idea of substituting the Margarita mix for the lemon and lime juice. I use about 1/4 cup. Otherwise right to the "T". This is by far our favorite chicken marinade now. Thanks a bunch to "LETSGGGO".

I made the recipe exactly as stated. I cut the chicken into thin strips and on a wooden skewer. They came out great! Really tasty, not too tangy with all the vinegar, mustard, lime juice and lemon juice. It was not too sweet, not to tangy. Perfect!

Excellent summer grilling recipe!  I made exactly as stated except I used bottled lemon and lime juice.  I'm sure it would be sooo much better with the real stuff, I just didn't have any.

This is the BEST. My daughter who never cooks tasted this and had to cook it for herself! A miracle! Everyone who tastes it falls in love with it. I now make it at least once a week. Thanks

We loved this chicken!  I used yellow mustard because I didn't have the coarse ground.  Marinated for 3 hours and reserved some for basting.  Yum yum yum!!!  Thanks so much!!

I made this two nights ago, and it was a hit with my family.  We love grilled chicken, and my husband and kids all told me they didn't want me to use the old marinade ever again!  I followed the recipe exactly, and allowed the chicken to marinate overnight.  The chicken had a great flavor, and was juicy and tender.

Delicious! I used boneless chicken thighs & my indoor grillpan, let the chicken marinate overnight, & it was heaven! I started eating 2 thighs, then said I could go for 1 more, then it was a 4th piece! Excellent recipe! Thank you!

Sorry! While my husband thought it was okay, I'm afraid I didn't find it very flavoursome and it didn't permeate through the chicken at all, leaving the middle tasteless and even a little dry.

Another way to make chicken ! We loved it. Follow the recipe and broiled it and used skinless boneless breast. It was VERY Tangy and yet sweet. My 5 year old grandson had seconds.

My entire family loved this recipe. I followed it exactly except I added some balsamic vinegar to the marinade and I only had time to marinate for 3 hours.  It was delicious.

This delicious! I made the marinade exactly as the recipe said, but instead of marinading and grilling the chicken, I shredded some baked breasts that I had leftover from the previous night, and sauteed them with broccoli, onion, and red bell pepper. Served over brown rice. Fantastic!!

This is my go-to chicken marinade.  I use the recipe as-is, and the end result is great; goes well with a wide variety of side dishes, or used on top of a green salad.

I think the title "unbelievable" set it up for disappointment for us.  The marinade didn't really "take".  I tried it a day later using more salt and it was better.  I pan fried it and the lovely sauce caramelized so it was almost like a Teriyaki Chicken.  The chicken came out soft and moist.  Just needed more intensity in flavoring.  I used jarred mustard instead of dry mustard and maybe that was part of the reason!

The title tells it all! There's no need for anything extra, not even bbq sauce to eat this chicken! My kids can't keep their fingers off the plate! Love it! Make sure you turn the grill down a bit when you cook it though!

Phenomenal! I'm a little garlic happy so I used a whole bulb of garlic. The chicken was super. Nice and moist. Wife says, "Again!" Use a couple of freezer bags to marinate 3 breasts each. Makes it easier to turn them in the marinade.

So far so good, I just mixed this marinade up to use overnight for grilled chicken tomorrow and if it tastes as good on grilled chicken as it does right now, I can't wait!  Literally I could almost drink this LOL, I'd probably be sick, but it is yummy.  Made a few changes but nothing major......I doubled the recipe, didn't have fresh limes so just used lemon.  No course ground mustard so used Dijon and only have thighs and drumsticks in the freezer with skin on, so that is what I'll use.  After Father's Day lunch tomorrow, I'll update on chicken flavor, but again, so far so good!

My husband absolutely LOVED this recipe when I made it last month, and he requested this be his Father's Day dinner.  I wouldn't change a thing, it was delicious just the way the recipe was written!  Chicken was so flavorful and moist.  I've used marinades in the past where you really can't taste it in the chicken after it's grilled, but you can definitely taste the flavors of the marinade with every bite!  Thank you!!

Yummy! I broiled the chicken 5 minutes on each side.  I also set some of the marinade aside and poured a small amount over it once it was done.  My DH kept saying how good it was :)

This recipe is very easy to prepare & comes out delicious.  I followed the directions for the ingredients, but I pounded the chicken & it turned out wonderful! We loved the texture of the chicken & it was juicy.

This is absolutely the best marinade I've tasted!  Don't change a thing! They key is to marinade it for the full 8hrs or overnight!

This tasted great - my kids (16 and 19) really liked it. I marinated the chicken overnight and was a little worried that it might have been too much, but it was really good. The only change I made is that I used 2 teaspoons of regular mustard, and 1 of Dijon mustard. I wasn't really sure that the recipe called for just Dijon or not, but next time I will use a full 3 teaspoons of Dijon to see what it turns out like.

Pretty tasty, although as my husband said "it still tastes like chicken".  The meat was juicy and tender and the outside of the meat was delicious, but the marinade didn't make it all the way through to the center.  I marinated overnight and most of the next day before grilling for dinner.  Next time I will cut the meat into cubes like some other reviewers to maximize the flavor on each piece of meat.  Very simple marinade and made with pantry staples, always a big plus.  Overall a 4 star, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is TOP SHELF. I cut my chicken into 2 inch cubes so I could make them into kabobs. I let chicken marry in the sauce overnight. I grilled it over a charcoal heat till done. SOOOOO good. This recipe in going into my tried and true file. YUM YUM YUM!!!

Delicious.  The combination of ingredients makes for an unexpectedly delicious meal.  Don't let the bland color of the marinade fool you.  I only marinated for 7 hours, but even that was delicious, cannot wait to try this while the meat had all night to marinade.

Yum yum yum! This adds so much flavor to a chicken breast! We eat a lot of chicken and I get tired of it easily so I'm always looking for ways to make it tastier. A few times I didn't have very long for it to sit in the marinade but it still turns out well. This is a keeper!

This was pretty tasty. Followed ingredients exactly. Everyone loved it, just thought it needed a little more flavor. Didn't marinade it for the full 8 hours. I will do it overnight next time to ensure more flavor.

This was just OK. I used chicken drumsticks and doubled the marinade since I used 16 drumsticks. I marinated them overnight and though they were juicy, they didn't have much flavor. I did make them indoors....so I baked them for about fifteen minutes and then broiled them until done and a bit crispy. Everyone said that if there was more flavor they would be good. I will stick to other recipes. Thanks though....

I didn't grill the chicken breasts, just baked them in the marinade for 50 min in a covered glass baking dish, and then I browned them for a few more minutes in a frying pan on medium heat, basting with the marinade. Delicious! I will definitely make this again, thanks!

Calling anything unbelievable means its likely not going to live up to expectations...That being said, it isn't, but it is very good.  I used regular yellow mustard out of the bottle and added some onion salt, garlic powder, and liquid smoke because I wanted to give it a little more zing.  It is very good.  Like one reviewer said, it doesn't smell that great while marinating, but it ends up good.

Very good chicken...whole family loved it. Put chicken in marinade that morning and was ready to grill by evening.  I deleted the mustard though, some of us don't like mustard but it was still really good.  Will keep this recipe!

Definitely marinate the chicken overnight - I marinated for about 6 hours and, while the flavor was good, it could have been better. I cut way back on the olive oil, and I cooked the chix on the Foreman grill. Not bad. Thanks!

This was good...but I would not go so far as to say it was "unbelievable."  I marinated for ~2 days and cooked in a pan on the stove.

This is now officially my favorite marinade. LOVE IT and so does my husband and kids. The longest I marinated was 4 hours just because i hadn't prepared to do longer. I also just tried it with Flank Steak and it was great.. Can't go wrong!!!

This chicken is exactly what it says: unbelievable.  Great flavor and very tender.  I made extra and served it sliced over a salad recipe from the site the next day so I had two great meals!

Even though I did not marinate for the full 8 hours, this was still tasty, moist, and delicious chicken.  Even the leftovers got compliments! Next time I will marinate longer, plus make some extra to pour over as sauce because it's so good you want more.

I admit, I changed this recipe a little b/c I had to.  I wanted to try this out while my husband is gone on business out of state b/c he doesn't like chicken.  I didn't have an course mustard like I thought I did.  I didn't use lemon, I doubled the lime b/c that is what I like.  I used ground powder mustard in place of the other.  And I added some honey, so that on the grill it would get a nice sticky glaze.  I am always worried about raw chicken, so I grilled a little too long and it was a tad dry.  But otherwise, I loved this marinade.  It was sweet, tangy and wonderful off the grill, as it gave it a smokey flavor.  This would be fantastic as fajita meat with guacamole (made with lime) and some fresh pico de gallo.  Anyhow, this is really good.  The garlic is a must.  OH, I also added red pepper flakes.  YUM!

This chicken was amazing! I substitued the coarse mustard with Bold & Spicy (that was all I had).  I marinated for the day and BBQ'd.  It was tender and juicy.  There were no leftovers.

This is pretty good, has a similar taste to a Honey Dijon type of chicken dish.  I forgot to buy a lime, so I added a touch more lemon.  I also used prepared Dijon mustard as that's what I had.  Perhaps that's why it reminds me of a honey dijon dish!  This recipe will go into the rotation.

This is a staple at my house in the summer.  I don't know about 'unbelievable' but it is very good and healthy too.  It's also good to serve to company since it's pretty non-offensive.  And the leftovers are great for sandwiches or chopped up in salad.  I use dijon mustard instead of coarse grain.

Wow! Great chicken. We put it together one night and grilled the next night. I will make this again, and again, and again...
PS- we used regular chicken thighs, it was all we had on hand.

My husband is hard to please and I have tried several recipes on this site and he has thought they were all "okay."  Well, this recipe he LOVED!  I loved it too!  Wouldn't change a thing...use real lemon and lime...I can see how the fake stuff would not taste as fresh.

Made this for a family weekend reunion and got great reviews from everyone. I made it just as the recipe called out for, didn't change a thing. Everyone particularly loved the mild sweet taste from the brown sugar. This was a winner!

Excellent marinade.  I did cut the sugar down to just a couple of tablespoons, and for our taste, that was perfect.  Chicken was very juicy and flavorful.  Will be using this one again!  Thanks.

WOW!  After only switching Dijon mustard in place of whole grain (had Dijon at home), I marinated the chicken for 24 hours.  I grilled it on low, turning it many times, and basting it many times.  It was succulent, glazed, and absolutely delicious.  My VERY picky 5 year old ate it all up!  THANK YOU for this recipe!  It is wonderful! We will have this often!

I have made this a couple of times now and it is delicious.  My husband has asked for it again.  I used chicken tenders the first time and pork tenders the second.  I'm actually having left-overs today.  I will definitely be making again.

You really don't expect this recipe to be "unbelievable", but it's pretty close. First of all, grilling this one is KEY! I pounded out my chicken breasts so they'd be willing to accept the marinade more.  Still wish I had just a bit of heat, but I guess it's okay to back off every now and then.  ;-)

This was OK but not "unbelievable."  I broiled the chicken instead of grilling it but I wouldn't think it make that much difference.

Everyone raved about this!  I cooked for 10 people & it was so quick & easy.  I used chicken breast & sweet italian turkey sausage cut up into 1/2" chunks, onions, peppers & mushrooms. I cooked it over high heat in a grill basket & served it over brown rice!  So easy! Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is awesome! The only thing I didn't add was the oil, salt and pepper.  Only because we try and stay away from those ingredients.

Great recipe thanks!

I was only able to marinate the chicken for about 2 hours, but it still turned out great.  I put the chicken in a baking dish and poured all of the sauce over the chicken.  It had great flavor, the only thing I can say I didn't like that it was too oily.  May be better on the grill.

This is a great marinade.  Tastey and easy.  I didn't have coarse ground mustard so I used dijon and it was still good.  Thanks!

I made this for dinner last night according to the recipe with the exception of substituting cane sugar and honey for brown sugar because I didn't have any.  It was soooo good.  My mother, who is used to eating Ethiopian food, AND my 9 year old niece who eats mac and cheese for dinner every night LOVED it.  Even the neighbor girl who said she doesn't like chicken liked it so much she kept sneaking bites off of everyone elses plates.  This is a keeper for me and my family.

This is our new favorite chicken marinade and is a nice change from teriyaki or italien flavors. I have used it for the grill and also under the broiler and with chicken breasts and whole cut up chickens with equally good results. Definitely a keeper.

This was good but not GREAT like everyone else raves.  I followed the directions exactly except I used dijon mustard instead because that's all I had.  I marinated for over 24 hours.  Chicken was tender and moist -- good overall flavor but not overwhelmingly great either.  I would still make it again anyways.

It was simple and easy to make. Instead of grilling it, I half cooked in the pan and then baked it for half an hour.

The flavors would compliment a salad.

I thought this was good but certainly not unbelievable.  I marinated the chix overnight and cut it up into pieces and made chix kebobs.  It wasn't as flavorful as we thought it would be.  If I make this again, I think I will reserve some marinade to brush on the chix while it's cooking.  I was really disappointed since there were so many good reviews for this recipe :(

Altogether too sweet, even tho I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 C.  The rest of the recipe is worth saving but I'll have to do some thinking about it before I try it again.  Even our young, sweet-toothed grandaughters didn't care of it.

Made the recipe with everything as stated but the lime juice. I didn't have that on hand. Kept the mixture and chicken in the refrigerator over night for almost 24 hours. Grilled and it was great! Just a mild flavor, just enough to give the chicken a boost from regular old grilled chicken. I will make again!

I mixed the marinade in a ziplock bag and threw it in a cooler to go camping. Bought the chicken on the way, threw it in the bag and dinner was ready to be cooked by the time we unpacked! Grilled over charcoal...wonderful. I will definately do this again.

I thought that this marinade, while very good, was nothing spectacular.  I followed the recipe to a T and marinated the chicken almost 24 hours. The chicken was moist, but with a whole lime and 1/2 a lemon, I thought I'd get a more citrus taste. It's a lot of ingredients for just an ordinary taste.  I've gotten better results with a bottle of marinade that I don't have to take the time to make.

Surprisingly tasty.  I marinaded (marinated?)the chicken 24 hours and used boneless chicken thighs.
Maybe a little too much oil in marinade for me.  I will cut back on the oil next time.

This was a little disappointing after reading all the rave reviews.  I marinated overnight and it had a nice flavor, just not much of it.  I will probably try it again and make extra marinade to cook and thicken and use as a sauce.  I may also try poking the chicken as others suggested.

This was a great tasing marinade. I took the advise of others and let it sit overnight. I marinaded skinless breasts and boneless/skinless thighs. The thighs definitely turned out the best. They soaked up much more of the flavor even after poking holes in the breasts. I will sure use this marinade again but not on white meat.

I marinated the chicken for 8 hours longer than the recipe recommended, but the chicken still did not have much flavor.  If I tried this recipe again, I would probably only use it for grilling kabobs.

This recipe was really good.  I omitted the lime because it wasn't readily available and i didn't like that you need to make it ahead, i'm a little last minute with dinner, but it was still great.  We will definately have it again.

Absolutely delicious!  I substitued spicy brown mustard and rice wine vinegar since that was what I had available.  I cooked the chicken tenderloins on my Forman grill... cut up and served on salad greens... thank you.. my guest asked for your recipe.

This sounds amazing and I have everyting on hand so this will be our dinner tonight.  I plan on making it into mixed skewers for the BBQ as suggested; that should also shorten the marinading time as I don't have 8 hours left until dinner!

Not quite "Unbelievable" but tasted good.  The marinade smelled a lot like honey mustard.  I used the George Foreman grill.

Really good chicken marinate.  I made the marinate the night before and then added chicken the next day, about 6-8 hours before grilling.

The flavor was truly unbelievably good, but for some reason the chicken was pretty dry.  I'm not sure if it was just that the breast we used were thin, or if the overnight marinade did something.  I think I might try with boneless thighs next time to see if a less lean cut will keep it juicier.

This was good.  I made the mistake of putting frozen chicken breast in with the marinade.  I think it diluted it when it thawed.  I will be trying this again soon but with thawed chicken breasts.  I cooked it on the George Foreman at 350 for 10 minutes.

I put this in my recipe box six months ago - I should've tried it much sooner!! This was really unbelievable. The flavor was amazing! I only made two chicken breast halves and grilled them on my bbq. This is something I will definitely be making again! Even my picky 2 1/2 year old had some!

When I was combine this marinade, and after I combined it, I tasted it, and I was like Oh My God this is gross, but I gave it the chance, and it turned out the best chicken ever. I made it for several people and they all love it. What a wonderful Marinade!

Yum-o! We let the chicken marinate for about 24 hours before putting it on the grill. It was super tasty. Sweet and tangy. The kids loved it - and so did the adults. Definitely a keeper.

Good, quite good.  I subbed in balsamic vinegar, becuase its what I had, and grilled on a grill pan.  The meat was tender, and Hubby was quite pleased, so were older kids.  I thought it was fine, but I had to cut off the outside for the 4 year old, because it was too strong.

My boyfriend loved this last night and it was super easy! That is an A+ recipe to me! The only changes that I made were: half the sugar (we don't like sweet foods and are dieting), and I didn't have cidar vinegar so I used half white distilled and half rice vinegar b/c that is what I had. I didn't measure anything out really, just used lime and lemon juice too, we only made 2 chicken breasts so it worked out well! Definetely will do again!

Good, good! Moist, delicious, tangy  - slightly sweet. Made a delicious sandwich, also. Marinated overnight and grilled. Will use again.

This is an unbelievable chicken recipe!  Most everyone went back for seconds.  Be sure and marinate as long as suggested.

This marinade is awesome. The longer you marinade the chicken the more tender it gets!!

I use the marinade in this recipe on boneless chicken breats and then make grilled chicken sandwiches.  I made them for a party and everyone went wild, there was not one sandwich left. Since my kids love the chicken this way I make sanwiches for them as well on a regular basis.

Cooking this chicken on the grill did not smell good at all. My husband was afraid to taste it.  It was OK. There are a ton of better chicken marinades out there.

This chicken was good, but not great. I made it according to the recipe only using tenders instead of breasts, when it was done cooking I thought the mustard and vinegar smell was a little overwhelming, but once the chicken cooled it smelled better. I used it in a tortilla wrap with spinach, tomato and ranch dressing. It turned out OK but I don't think I will make it again.

I thought this was wonderful. I cut the chicken in chunks and marinated them overnight and skewered them before cooking on the grill. My guests also thought it was great. Served over salad. A real nice summer dinner.

I don't know if this chicken was UNBELIEVABLE but it was very good.  I didn't have any coarse ground mustard so we just used ground (powder).  It was still great.  After we removed the chicken from the marinade we strained it and boiled it for a few minutes and used it as a sauce to top the chicken.  

Very good!  I will make this again.  Thanks for posting!

This was absolutely delicious!  I love the marinade -- very nice combination with the chicken.  The meat was extremely moist and had a nice glaze coating when grilled.  Yummy!

Thought this was pretty good.  I took advice from another reviewer and didn't use the lemon mainly b/c I didn't one but I used lime juice.  I also put all in a crock pot, added two large split breats and 8 legs and let cook all day.  I was hoping the sauce would evaporate or cook up a lot and the skin would really get saturated and dark with flavor but it didn't.  It was very soupy, not in a bad way, just not what I was hoping for.  Otherwise a pretty good chicken dish.  I'm sure if we were to grill it, the skin and such would have been as hoped for, but when hubby gets home so late (he's the griller)i don't want to mess with it sometimes! Next time we'll grill. Although there are sooooo many chicken recipes, i've barely scratched the surface at trying them!

This is fantastic chicken marinade.  I used spicy brown mustard, didn't have course ground.  I also used juice of whole lemon and lime then I threw the rinds in the bag with the marinade.  I marinaded for 8 hours then grilled.  It is fantastic.  The second time I made sandwiches with bacon, tomato and monterey jack cheese.  Great.

This is a wonderful recipe. Put it in your recipe box. I did not have the time to marinade for a long time. I used granular garlic. Next time I will follow the recipe with fresh garlic and give the chicken more time to marinade. I used chicken tenders and they were moist, flavorful and very delicious. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

My family loved this recipe....I will definitely make this again.  Only my daughter didn't like it after I told her it had mustard in it....but if I had not told her I don't think she would have picked it out.  The flavors together are really good....just enough tang with a little sweet.  YUM!~

Really Good chicken! I was amazed that it didn't dry out on the grill. I kept the breasts whole so that increased the cooking time, but over all it was a wonderful summer meal. The leftovers were great on salads! Also, Lemon and Lime juice actually tenderizes the chicken. It would never toughen it.

This was a very good marinade! I marinated the chicken overnight and grilled it and it was so delicious. My dad and sister both loved it, no one ingredient was too overpowering. My dad really liked the taste of the mustard, he said he could definitely taste it, which is a good thing. Those who say they thought the vinegar was overpowering must be REALLY sensitive to it, because it certainly was not, this coming from someone who does not like the smell. I am very happy with this recipe!

This marinade is absolutely fantastic!! My husband and I loved it. We're looking forward to putting some of the leftover chicken in our salads tomorrow. I followed the recipe exactly. I let it marinate overnight and the flavor was spectacular. Thanks for the recipe Ruthie. It was a big hit.

Fantastic!  A few changes I made based on what I had.....2 T fine ground mustard (dry-spice) rather than the 3 T prepared course ground mustard and I cut the olive oil in half (used 3T).  This will be a regular in our house!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Awesome chicken recipe with a hint of citrus and apple.  Even my picky children gulped it down!  I highly recommend it for a great summer meal.

Best chicken marinade I've found.  I've cooked this several times and it has NEVER tasted like vinegar.

It wasn't bad.  It did have a slight vinegar taste dispite adding about 1 T of honey.  The chicken was tender and juicy, but that may have been cooking to the correct temperature.

Snaps for Ruthie! This is a wonderful marinade. I followed her recipe and then added honey as another suggested. Simply divine. I vaccuumed it in a food saver cannister for about 5 hrs. It was  moist and flavorful, very good.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. I also warmed the remainder of the marinade in the microwave so that it could be used as dipping sauce for the chicken. EXCELLENT recipe!

Doesn't seem like this would be a  big deal, but it's very good. I like to make extra to cut up and put on top of salads.

I am not a fan of chicken, but I really enjoyed this one!  My kids (8, 5, 3) said that it's better than chicken nuggets, which is a high compliment coming from them!  LOL  DH couldn't decide whether to give it 4 or 5 stars.  It is flavorful and yet versatile enough that leftovers could be doctored up a lot of different ways.  I did not think it was too vinegar-y and it doesn't have a mustard taste either.  I'm going to make extra for chicken salad next time.  I generally do *not* care for chicken and I was snacking on it while cutting it up for my kids!  The only thing I would do different next time is to reserves some of the marinade for basting and perhaps reserve a bit to drizzle over the chicken as I prefer my food very flavorful. Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

While this marinade made the chicken very tender and juicy, I wouldn't make it again unless I used about half the recommended amount of cider vinegar.  The flavor of the vinegar was overpowering and was unappetizing.

This was easy to make and it tasted good. "Unbelievable" might be stretching it a bit, but it's a dish that many people will enjoy.

This chicken really didn't do anything for me. I let it marinate over night and cooked it just like the recipe said... will not make again.

I wouldn't say this is unbelievable but it's pretty good! Used ¾ yellow mustard and ¼ coarse-ground mustard with horseradish (out of 1 tablespoon for 2 servings) didn’t have coarse-ground mustard. I also used jarred minced garlic instead of fresh garlic and doubled it. Marinated for 8 to 9 hours. I think I over cooked mine a bit and was a little dry but I was using an electric outside grill - not always the best for exact timing. Thanks for the recipe anyhow and I will be using it again! *Update: Served with Zesty Hominy and Cheese from this site, grilled slices of bread and baked potatoes.

This was pretty good chicken it's just that I have discovered I don't like the smell or flavor of cider vinegar and that was a dominate flavor of the marinade.  So I will make again using white vinegar and I'm sure it will be much more to my liking.  I pounded the breasts flat and quick seared them in a hot pan.  The sugar caramelized beautifully for a nice presentation.

I have to admit I too was skeptical at this array of ingredients. Wow was I shocked. My whole family loved it. I made this last week for the 1st time, and have made it once again already and have been asked to make it again.  Will add to my menu rotation. Thanks.

This was OK but just not to our liking.  We ended up putting the chicken back on the grill on low and basting with BBQ sauce then adding a sprinkling of Cavender's Greek Seasoning.

Wonderful - chicken came out juicy and flavorful.  Only thing I added was a smidge of cayenne and some chili powder as we like things spicy.

This is a great recipe- the chicken turns out really tender and tasty.  I should have, however, took the advice of other reviewers and slightly reduced the sugar - I thought it was a little too sweet, (but my family disagreed).
