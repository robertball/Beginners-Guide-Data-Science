I substituted cashew milk for the soy milk, but it is amazing! I am experimenting with vegan recipes for friends. I love regular buttercream frosting, but I think this just took its place! Yummmmm!

I used silk sweet & creamy vegan coffee creamer in place of the soy milk. Easy & delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This frosting is so delicious! I make it all of the time. It's sweet and a little salty and has a great texture. It's not the prettiest color in the world because of the peanut butter so I usually use it as a filling for layer cakes but it's my go-to for any vegan chocolate cake.

Used this for a gluten free vegan chocolate cake with vegan chocolate ganache. This was amazing  this will be my go to for vegan peanut butter frosting now. Only alteration I made was added extra vanilla extract and full fat coconut milk in place of soy milk. Can be made healthier using natural peanut butter and non hydrogenated shortening. This was such a hit!  Thanks!

Receives an outstanding review from my peanut-butter loving husband, and me.  Is light and fluffy, and the perfect topping for the chocolate zucchini cake I baked!  I put it together just as recipe dictates with the exception of not measuring out the soy milk - drizzled it into the mixture until it was the consistency I wanted for the cake.

Delicious! So smooth and creamy! Truly tasted like Nutter butters!!! It does turn out a little stiff but you can just add more soy milk to make more manageable. I used a vegan chocolate cake mix added the frosting and topped with Mazap√°n Mexican candy as it was a perfect topping.
