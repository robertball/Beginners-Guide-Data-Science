I could hardly taste the crabmeat. It tasted mostly like breadcrumbs. I was suggest twice as much crabmeat and some other spices. It was just too bland. I think I will use a different recipe next time.

I did so many changes on this recipe I can't say it was good or not.  I only added 1 egg.  I added the stems sauted in butter.  Also 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1/2 tsp black pepper.  added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and parsley for color.

Very good recipe. Marinating the mushrooms gave them a little extra flavor, even the kids liked them!

Every time I make this, they are eaten in no time flat.  I have started adding some chopped garlic and some parmesan cheese.  Very Yummy.

Excellent recipe, the only change I plan on making is using italian flavored breadcrumbs instead of plan. Made these for my boyfriend who is not a big seafood fan and he loved them. Really easy. Thanks for submitting the receipe

I also liked the tangy taste from marinating them. A bit on the bland side as written; I went a lot heavier with some spices and everybody loved them.

Very delicious, I added red onion and some fresh chopped chives from my garden for colour and also added one small clove of garlic for that extra "zip". Did not use 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, just kept adding while mixing for texture and baking time. Did not add any egg and marinade the mushrooms in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

I tweaked this recipe and it was AWESOME!! Two batches never made it to their destination because my husband and son helped themselves to the irresistable scented dish! BROILED instead of baking,added seasoned salt and pepper,increased Lump crabmeat portion ,added yellow mustard,decreased bread crumbs, broiled 5 mins. then topped with Cheddar Jack chesse to melt 1& 1/2 minutes more.

Great recipe! The only change I made was putting a little cheese on top. I didn't buy enough mushrooms so I used the remaining crab mixture to make crab cakes which were super good. I also used crab and shrimp not just crab. I made these for a few friends and they loved them. Soaking the mushrooms in italian dressing def gives them a little extra flavor. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice also not that bottled stuff.. Very yummy!!!

ALL WE COULD TASTE WAS THE BREADCRUMBS. 
WE USED LIKE THE BEST CRAB YOU CAN BUY AND COULDNT TASTE IT AT ALL.
I THINK THE ITALIAN DRESSING OVERRULES THE WHOLE FLAVORR.

There was way to much bread crumbs,  Barely any crab, and not much taste to them.

I made one change to make my job easier: I used instant stuffing mix. They were taken off the platter as my husband carried them into the house. Worked out great, and the leftover stuffing made delicious dip, even served cold the next day.

I agree double the crabmeat but I used crab claw which is cheaper. I  enjoyed them and i like that this recipe doesn't call for butter. I also made my own Italian dressing instead of store bought. I think that helped with the seasoning. I didn't sprinkle the whole half cup of remaining breadcrumbs either. just lightly sprinkled each mushroom.

Easy and definitely a keeper....needs a touch more salt and parmesan... made baked crabcakes  w/leftover filling.   Did not make 20 since that would be way too many for 2 of us.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was VERY easy to make. Most of the ingredients are staples in my home (aside from the mushrooms and the crab meat).  I agree, this recipe appears and tastes like it was harder than it actually was.  Thanks for posting it!
