3.30.18  The lemony flavor of the sumac does come through, and it partners well with the chili powder.  This was pretty good, I just don’t know that I liked it well enough to make again.

Good recipe but one that made me realize I am not a fan of sumac. No fault of the recipe but just a personal preference. If you love sumac and popcorn too then you really should give this one a try!

I liked the seasonings but thought there was too much butter. Next time, I’ll half the amount.
