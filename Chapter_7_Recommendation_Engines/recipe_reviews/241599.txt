This is a great way to add protein into dessert and it's not heavy. Everyone like it and complimented me.

This separated when it was chilled leaving a pool of coconut milk in the bottom of the pudding. Flavor is okay but the final pudding doesnâ€™t stay together.

This was really good!  I made exactly as written except I didn't have lime, so I used lemon juice.
