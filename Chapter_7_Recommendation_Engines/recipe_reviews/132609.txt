I thought this was pretty good. Couldn't really shape it into a patty, just dumped it into the frypan and then shaped it into a patty. I fried it in olive oil.

I'm not quite sure if I recognize this dish. I'm Korean, but I've never seen this before. It's more like the Japanese okonomiyaki than anything Korean.... It tasted pretty good though.

Pretty good, it doesn't form into a patty at all, it's too moist, I added a 2 cups of bread crumbs though, some red pepper flake (1 tablespoon), some onion, bit of garlic, it was very good. I baked it instead of fried it at 450 for 45 minutes (I had potatoes baking along side it), never ever seen this in or near korea though. Spent a year in south korea. Either way it's good.

I don't think there's anything Korean about this. I remember having a street snack with a bulgogi burger with cabbage and egg...but not this. It needs some spice!

My husband said it was like a vegetable omelette. I added chopped onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Next time maybe I will add some grated potato, and make it like a potato pancake. I'd like to know if this is indeed vietnamese or japanese? It was a good way to use up the cabbage I had left over from making egg rolls...

I liked this recipie. Trying to reduce the fat in my diet. So I used 1 tsp of olive oil instead of the 2 Tbsp of butter. Turned out great.

I added a little bit more soy sauce (low sodium) than specified and added some ginger. I also substituted peanut oil for the butter.  I served it on whole wheat toast with sliced (mild) chiles and cucumber.  It was delicious.

Made recipe as written.  Had to throw most away.  My kids refused to eat it, and even I had to force myself.  Doesn't taste like fried eggs OR cole slaw, just like wilted cabbage (and I LIKE cooked cabbage!).  The recipe sounded good, but it was sloppy (does not make true patties) and unpleasant.

I deep fried this like corn fritters which it resembles a lot. you want to make sure the veggies are pretty dry to hold together and i also added a little chili powder and baking mix to hold it together better. next time i may use panko on the outside. If you are vegan you can omit the egg and just use baking mix like krusteaz and it's not too shabby.
