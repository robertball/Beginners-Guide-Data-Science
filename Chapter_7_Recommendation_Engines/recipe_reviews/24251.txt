Pineapple Chicken Bites were the hit at our party.  Try mixing the sauce with the chicken to save time.  Enjoy!

it needed something to kick it up.  the nutmeg was WAY too strong.  a good idea, but it needs a little sprucing up!

Good but they seemed a little soggy and the ginger was just a little too much.  I would cut back on that a little next time.  I left the rolls out of the refrigerator for about 15 mins. before I used them - perhaps that is why they seemed soggy to me.  My husband and daughter seemed to enjoy them, however.

Tasty, quick recipe.  I liked and even upped the ginger a bit. I recommend using a non-stick spray on the cookie sheet.  If the honey/pineapple mixture leaks out they stick a bit. I used crushed pineapple instead of chunks.  That made them easier to roll up.

I think this would be better with leftover rotisserie chicken.  I used a jarred plum chutney, and microwaved chicken thights for this recipe.  I used pineapple tidbits, and dotted each one with honey before I closed them up.  Also, next time I would roll or press out the triangles a bit first, just to get a bit more room.  When folding, fold the point of the triangle over the wider part, flip it over and fold the sides in, then wrap and press the tip of the triangle around the rest of the package.  That seemed to work the best.  I didn't think they were soggy like a previous reviewer, but I also cooked them at 375 for 11 minutes hoping to avoid that problem.
Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved these!!! I made a few changes. I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. This gave it the kick and flavor everyone said this recipe was missing. I also suggest cutting the pineapple chunks down to allow for more even bites and it was easier to fold. I also mixed the chicken in the sauce and brushed the sauce on the crescents. Delicious!!

I took the pineapple juice, ginger, and honey mixture, added a little bit of salt and pepper and brushed it over the chicken as it was grilling on the George Forman Grill. Then I cut the chicken into pieces and mixed it with crushed pineapple, ginger, and honey. I didn't spread the juice on the dough, but instead I put some sliced Pepper Jack cheese down, then put the chicken pineapple mixture. This helped with the "soggy" issue. Once I sealed them up, I placed more Pepper Jack on top. It added a good kick to the Bites. All in all, my husband and I really enjoyed this dish!

I was expecting this to be better, the only reason I gave it a 3 is because my husband said "it's edible".

I liked the concept, the ginger doesnt work, next time I will leave out the ginger and I think it will go over better at home.

This recipe was a nice idea but the ginger was WAY too overpowering. I would make this again but I would play around with the recipe ingredients and cut WAY back on the ginger.

edible, but wish I'd read the other reviews before I made it. 1 Tbsp of ginger TOO much! A kind of boring recipe..I used canne chicken and crushed pineapple, but quite sure that wasn't the problem.

We used "pâte brisée" for the crust, which tasted great. After struggling to wrap the first triangle, instead we put more chicken and pineapple on each triangle and topped it with a second triangle and sealed the edges, which made for a nicer-looking (but larger!) final product. Also, I accidentally used 3 tbsp of the juice, rather than 3 tsp, making for a thinner sauce, but it worked out fine, and I brushed a bit on top of the triangles before baking. Amusingly of the 3 people enjoying the final product, one found the honey too strong, and the other found it not strong enough, so it's a real question of taste with respect to the sweetness factor! In any case, I thought it was great, and will definitely make it again!

It was all right. It didn't have much flavor and I didn't like the nutmeg, but other then that it was decent.

I made this recipe for a small get together with friends and they were gone in a flash. Everyone loved them and my friend wanted the recipe. I also made them for dinner and added BBQ baked beans on the side and it was great. I really enjoyed this recipe.

Not bad, the flavor is good, the warm crescent roll very comforting. I had fresh pineapple but other then that I followed exactly. The center is doughy but not a deterrent. My Mom ate 5 of them and Hubby had a plate full as well. The ginger is strong, but I like ginger so I didn't mind it.  All in all a good recipe and one I will use again.

These are good. Everyone liked them-even the kids. You may want to spray the sheet you're baking them on first. the pineapple juice and honey run out and carmelize causing them to stick a little.
