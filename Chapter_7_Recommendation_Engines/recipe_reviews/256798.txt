I could not find the McCormick's Cheesy Taco Seasoning mix anywhere locally so the first time I made it I just used the regular flavor and it was okay but missing something. I found the cheesy version on Amazon and ordered some. It was much better. I've made it several times for family and once for a potluck- everyone wanted the recipe!

Super simple and full of flavor.  This is so good that I recommend doubling the recipe because I promise you it  won't last long. I was not familiar with the cheesy taco seasoning mix prior to making this recipe and I was so impressed with the flavor that I will be using it the next time I make tacos. Great recipe and great product!

This was a quickie.  I had some Velveeta left over from Christmas over 2 months ago.  Does this stuff ever spoil?  Good grief.  I added more sour cream than the recipe indicated because the melted dip was a little too stiff.  The can of chilies gave it enough zing that I chose not to add the taco seasoning.  If I ever buy Velveeta again, I will try this dip again.

Made this as my first attempt at Queso using Colby Jack, Reed bell pepper, a quarter of a Serrano pepper minus the seeds, and a bit of diced red onion. A bit unsaid

Tasty! I put everything except sour cream in my mini crock pot on warm setting for a few hours. I stirred the sour cream in 20 before serving. I used low sodium regular taco packet.

This was pretty easy and decent tasting.  I'm still looking for that perfect quesso with a little extra though.
