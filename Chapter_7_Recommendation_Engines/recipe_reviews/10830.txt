My family loved these chewy cookies.  The only thing I changed is I didn't make the homemade icing, instead I purchased the Betty Crocker pecan frosting that's already prepared (much cheaper and easier than buying the nuts and making it yourself).

Great cookies - very rich and chocolatey.  Make sure cookies are completely cooled before icing or they break apart.

Perfect! I found this recipe doing an ingredient search, as I am down to bare bones. I didn't have Baking Soda, but they still turned out very well. My hubby is happily munching away on a warm one right now. Will def use this again!

My mother loves German Chocolate cake.  I think she likes these cookies even more!  I can't wait to make another batch. These cookies impressed my brother who is critical of everything.  All the cookies were gone in two days.  Make sure to let the icing cook awhile and if it seems runny, add more sugar. I definitely will make these again.

These cookies are really good!  They taste like double chocolate chip cookies w/ German chocolate frosting.  But, I didn't give 5 stars b/c they are really messy to eat and stick to my cookie sheets really bad.  I prefer a cookie to be more portable.  And, I like to bring cookies to gatherings to share, but with the frosting, they don't package well.  But, like I said, really yummy!

These were amazing! I did make a few changes though. Instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips I used 1 cup of chocolate chips plus 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 cup of coconut. For the frosting I used the following recipe: Combine 1 egg (lightly beaten), 1- 5 ounce can of evaporated milk, 2/3 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup of butter in a saucepan. Cook and stir 10-12 minutes over medium-low heat until slightly thickened(don't turn the heat up too high or you could end up with some sweet scrambled eggs). Stir in 1 1/3 cup of coconut and at least 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. After the cookies are done I drizzle them with chocolate (chocolate chips in a Ziploc bag microwaved 20 seconds at a time until melted). Delicious and pretty!

I read all the reviews and tried it.  I could not understand why it did not hold shape or resemble a cookie.  After I baked them, they crumbled, were pretty much flat and more like a fudge then a brownie cookie, I expected more of a brownie consistancy (half cookie half cake). I thought I made an error some where, forgot something for it to have turned out this badly (my taste buds though) I made this to give to give to a caregiver and had to hold it back. I wasted the chips.  I'm going to have to see if I can give it away.  I'm giving it a ** because the chips saved it.

not bad. i used actual hersheys kisses, not finding any other chocolate to bake with and it still turned out great. did the recipe by hand (no electris mixer) and it still worked. just wished it was more moist and chewy. maybe if i added more eggs.

I added nuts and coconut to the cookies and omitted the frosting and they came out very good. I also used butter instead of shortening. Next time I'll make them I'll cut down on the sugar and leave out the coconut though, because they are just a bit too sweet for me. They are delicious though!

This Cookie was very good, but it was too sweet. Next time I would leave out a little sugr in the cookie section of the recipe because the frosting was sweet also. The frosting for this cookie was a horrible recipe I found a much better one:
Coconut pecan filling or frosting

Very easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a bit more coconut to the icing and a tad bit less choc. chips in the batter. Super tasty, huge chocolate flavour! I will make again... make with a different icing.

While the overall taste of this cookie is pretty good, the texture was crumbly and the addition of the icing was messy.  If I make them again, I will probably use actual German Chocolate Cake icing.  My husband loves German Chocolate Cake so he enjoyed this cookie but I'll stick to making the cake for now.

Fabulous!  I made a few changes - I don't use hydrogenated oils, so I substituted half butter and half coconut oil for the shortening in the cookies, and used coconut oil in place of the shortening in the frosting.  Worked like a charm.  I also used dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet, as I prefer dark chocolate.  The cookies do have a cake-like consistency and stay moist.  My man's fav cake is German chocolate, and these are so much easier to whip up....and he loved them!

My husband LOVED these but we thought they were too sweet. I'll definitely cut way down on the sugar in the cookie part next time.  the frosting is fine, just don't overcook it, it'll taste like custard if you do.

These cookies are fabulous!  I made these cookies for a baking competition at work and didn't want to necessarily make a cake as it would be difficult to serve, so I was very happy when I came across this recipe.  Everyone loved them.  I still get compliments weeks later on how delicious they were.  I followed the recipe as written.  I love the brownie consistency of the cookie, and the homemade frosting is worth the effort to make.  I love German chocolate, so I actually put enough frosting on the cookies to flow over the edges and let them set up overnight - they turned out amazing.  I would totally make this recipe again!  Two thumbs up!

This recipe was so simple & quick, & they turned out beautifully! I often have my cookies flatten out, so when these came out so great I was very happy. I didn't add the full amount of chocolate chips, I usually add less than what most recipes call for though. After these baked I gave them to my "taste-testers" before making the frosting, I ended up not frosting them. With the amount of brown sugar used, they would have been way to sweet with frosting. I'd lower the chips & sugar if you're going to frost them. I recommend doubling this recipe because they go fast :)!!
