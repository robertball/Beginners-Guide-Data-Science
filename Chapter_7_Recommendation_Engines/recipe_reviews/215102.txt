I made this last night with "Greek Souzoukaklia" (from this site).  It was the perfect compliment to the meat! I did have to make some changes- I didn't have anchovies,a nd I played with the fresh herbs a bit. It was wonderful!

This made an excellent salad dressing simply thinned out with some buttermilk.  I scaled this down to eight servings, and used  1/2 tsp. of anchovy paste for the one lonely anchovy.  I’m not fond of tarragon, so I skipped it as well as the parsley, preferring instead to use some green onion and a handful of basil.  This is crisp and fresh tasting, great on a tossed green salad.

I made only half of this, but because I only had a little fresh tarragon left, I had to use a part of the dried version.  I also used 1/2 teaspoon of anchovy paste rather than the fillet.  The first night I used it as a salad dressing, and it didn't go over that well.  The next night I used it as it as written---a dip----and it was a good success!  This will definitely be a repeat for company!  Thanks for this recipe!

Great. I made this as an additional sauce to remoulade to go with crab cakes, shrimp and artichokes.

This was a big hit at the party! I was asked to bring a dip to a party and I decided to try something new rather than the standard sour cream and onion dip. The dip was light and refreshing. Those fresh herbs were just the thing for a refreshing summer taste.  Every last bit of dip was eaten and I was complimented by almost everyone. I did make sure the dip had at least four hours to sit in fridge so the flavors could develop.   I grated the garlic rather than mincing it. This gave it quite a bit of extra garlic punch. I think next time I will use one clove of garlic rather than two if I’m grating the garlic again. 
I served it in a small bread bowl with veggies and pretzels. I also garnished the plate edible flowers. I’m really glad the dip tasted as good as the plate looked.

Very garlicky, which is a good thing.  I think more parsley and other herbs could improve this dip.
