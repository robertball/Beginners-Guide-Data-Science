My son woke up this morning with the bug to cook.  Eager to assist, I suggested this Paella recipe which I saw printed in the Aug/Sep 14  allrecipes magazine.  Other than not being familiar with grated tomatoes, which I found described on the internet, the recipe was easy to follow.  I used crushed tomatoes anyway and strained them.  Seemed to work fine.  Great flavor, dramatic presentation.  I will use this one again.  Thanks

This was my first time making paella, but it won't be my last! We loved this dish. I made it on Christmas Eve so I added a grilled lobster, prawns and blue crabs, but I wouldn't do that unless it's a special occasion. There was a definite learning curve to making this dish. Mine took more chicken stock than the recipe called for, I'm not sure how much more because I just kept adding it until my rice was the right texture. Also, I started this dish on one stove burner, but quickly noticed I needed to use two of them. I also had to keep rotating the pan to ensure the pot was cooking evenly. We have a small wood fire in our backyard and I think I would like to try cooking this over that next time. The best part of this dish is the rice! The rice has a gorgeous brown crust that forms and it is flavored beautifully with the onions, garlic and chorizo. I am really looking forward to making this again! Thanks Maria for a great recipe!

Delicious paella! I left out the chicken and used a package of mixed seafood that I picked up at Whole Foods yesterday, which worked perfect! I scaled this down to 6 servings (1-1/2 cups paella rice), and I needed close to 5 cups of chicken broth in order for the rice to be al dente. Just a warning for others, to have some extra broth hot and ready in case you need it. My husband LOVED this, and is already asking me to make it when his family comes to visit us from Italy over the holidays!

While I have eaten lots of paella, this was my first attempt at making it. I was nervous, but this recipe was perfect and easy for even a first-timer to follow! It was delicious! I didn't change a thing, and will be making this again!

This recipe is excellent. I substituted arborio rice as I could not find Bomba rice. I also added in bay scallops along with the shrimp. Ultimately I needed an additional cup of chicken stock (maybe because of the arborio rice). All-in-all this was awesome and better than Ive had in any restaurant. The kids absolutely loved it. They already requested this be added to the family menu! Thank you for positing this recipe.

I just got back from Spain and was looking for a recipe to recreate the delicious paella I had while I was there, and this was it! It was easier than I expected and the whole family loved it. I didn't include all the seafood (just the shrimp) because I live far from the sea and it's expensive, but it was good anyway.

We just finished the leftovers and my DH asked for it again. Fairly easy to make, fit into a 10” traditional paella pan. I used chicken, chorizo, and shrimp for simplicity’s sake.  To get the soccarat (crunchy bottom), I shifted the pan around on the gas burner in the last phase of cooking so all parts got some heat but not too much. We served it with some oil & vinegar slaw (cabbage, carrots, Vidalia onion) on the side and big glasses of red wine.

Doubled recipe with some variations. Didn't need to increase oil amount and found cooking time to vary some. Recipe is closest I found to be in line with the traditional recipes I had experienced while living in Spain. Was a big hit with the Family this 4th!

It’s delicious however I think it required too much oil. Next time I’m going to use less olive oil.

My boyfriend and I have been looking for an authentic Spanish paella recipe, and he absolutely loved this one. We buy our dried chorizo from The Fromaggio Kitchen and got the rice, paprika, saffron and pan on amazon. I will be making this again this weekend.

I add cooked shrimp and krab at the end and leave out the clams, mussels, prawns.  I debone the chicken thighs and chop the meat, then saute with the onions, garlic, red and green bell pepper.  I leave out the peas.  Sometimes I add a few fresh mushrooms. Paella is such a forgiving dish; it will be wonderful with just about any alterations.

Great flavour! Used turmeric instead of saffron and used the wok so it was a bit burnt. Oily but not terrible.

Fabulous recipe. The seafood was fantastic, but my favorite part were the pieces of golden chicken. My paella pan is on the larger side, so I will add more rice and stock next time as the majority of mine was caramelized on the bottom of the pan.
