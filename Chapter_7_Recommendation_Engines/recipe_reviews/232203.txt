This recipe was excellent - thank you so much!  The paneer is easily substituted with tofu and the spice can be adjusted up or down, according to your preferences.  We loved this and will definitely be making this again.

Thanks so much for the recipe!  The only changes I made was to substitute grated almonds for the cashew paste; I did not have enough chilies so I added red curry paste and sriracha chili sauce; I substituted almond milk for the cream and milk.  This is a new family favourite.

This recipe was really wonderful. I was trying to make this cheap and use ingredients I had on hand. Made my own garam masala using a recipe for the spice mix, blended fresh ginger and garlic to make paste and used sriracha hot sauce instead of red pepper paste. Also used fresh almonds stuck in a blender with some oil instead of the cashew paste and only milk (no half and half). My only issue is that it turned out very dull in color. I was expecting bright orange/red and it was sorta peach/pink. Maybe use tomato paste instead of sauce?

This recipe has been an excellent introduction into Indian cooking. I have used fresh garlic and ginger instead of the paste, and it still comes out good. This is a household favorite!

we used fresh tomatoes, made tomato cream and used it instead of tomato sauce. used fresh cream instead of half and half because it wasn't available. it appeared pink/orange in colour than red. but taste was delicious and just how we expected it to be. thank you so much for sharing this recipe

Really enjoyed the recipe. Next time I'll up the amount of spice a little bit, but the dish has a decent kick as is. I had trouble browning the paneer on all sides without overcooking, something I'll have to work on.

Oh my goodness.  This is super incredibly delicious!  But I am a huge fan of paneer (my own or the frozen cheese I can get at my market), so maybe I'm biased.  But this is a 10 out of 10 for me.

I really liked it, i The only thing I added was some frozen green peas and steamed tender cauliflower just because I thought it might taste good.  It did!

This is YUMMY! Made almost exactly as written--didn't have the red chilles so I substituted a bit of Thai red curry paste I had in the fridge. Otherwise followed to a t, it is superb! Made my own paneer (very easy to do and economical) from the paneer recipe on this site, my whole family loved this.

Paneer is always delicious and I love eating it and making it. This recipe exploits the flavours very well.
