So wonderful!  I've tried a million sugar free cookie recipes and this is the only one up to my standards.  I used Splenda in the cookies.  There was no aftertaste.  I used Pollaner all fruit sugar free strawberry preserves, which were awesome!  I also used Smuckers sugar free apricot preserves, but there was a sweetner aftertaste to those preserves.  Beautiful, wonderful texture, decorative, good for gifts, diabetics, and they don't taste like sugar free!

Overall a pretty good cookie. Watch the artificial sweetener that you select as some leave a bitter aftertaste.

I made these with Splenda and splenda sweetened raspberry preserves for my diabetic uncle.  He went crazy!  We could barely keep everyone else from eating them. I used a little less Splenda because it is extra sweet and we didn't notice a funky aftertaste after the cookies were baked.  Thanks a million-especially from my uncle!

Excellent cookie that everyone just loves. I make them quite small with 1/2 of them raspberry preserves and 1/2 apricot preserves. Both work great.

These turned out good. I didnt want to fuss so instead of rolling them out I just rolled the dough into a log and sliced them into wafers. I didnt even stuff with preserves. We ate them as-is. Very tasty. Just like an almond butter cookie.

I made a half of recipe for new hubby.  I used a homemade sugar-free mixed berry jam and "fake" powder sugar to dress them up.  They went very quickly -- next time I will have to make the full recipe!

Fabulous for being sugar free. Try using a flavored greek yogurt (or plain) as a substitute for sour cream.  It does add a bit of sugar but you will NOT be dissapointed! My grandpa can't get enough of these :D

I used pecans rather than almonds and used strawberry and blueberry simply fruit spread, and got rave reviews.  While the cookie itself is somewhat bland, that's perfect so it doesn't compete with the filling, though I did enjoy broken ones (my son spilled the pan and while the cookies were saved from hitting the floor, they broke) by themselves.  Probably won't make often since we like sugar, its a good recipe to have on hand for those who are avoiding sugar.

I made these along with the regular linzer tart cookie recipe. I did add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. This I believe made them more like a linzer tart. I was pleasantly surprised. They are very similar. They just seemed a bit lighter and flaky. I will definitely be making these again.

I had high hopes for this recipe being it was low sugar. These were just ok. The taste was bland, & if it weren't for the raspberry spreadable fruit I used (raspberry St. Dalfour from France, sweetened with grape juice) they would be tasteless. I did use Splenda, & cut with 2" heart cookie cutters, & a mini heart for the middles. They're part of a Valentines gift for my hubby----hopes he likes them better than me.

These were tasty but dry and the raspberry jam was too sweet so I mixed it with strawberry.

Not as good as other sugar free desserts, but they are the only sugar free cookie I've found.

Tasty, but definitely time consuming! I had to roll my dough out almost paper thin so they wouldn't be too thick after stacking them. I used sugar free blackberry preserves, and when these are fresh from the refrigerator, they are the best!

I used this recipe with the following changes..
I baked it like a biscotti..which worked really nicely!!!
I used fruit flavored no sugar yogurt(instead of sour cream)
added only 1/4 of almonds to batter and used the balance to roll
the dough in.
I also found that using the wire whip instead of flat beater worked better making it nice and fluffy...

These cookies turned out bland, flavorless and misshapen. I bake often, and even though I followed the ingredients and directions carefully, these did not turn out.

Liked the flavor of the cookies a lot.  But I'm really lazy so I didn't make the dough into individual small cookies.  Rather, I rolled the dough out and put it on the bottom of a 9x10 pan and used the cooked result as the bottom layer of a strawberry shortcake.  I also preferred Almond Extract instead of the Vanilla Extract since I was adding chopped almonds to the dough.

These were great! They are definitely in the rotation for the holidays. 4 members of the family are diabetic and they all loved these. Next time I will buy pre-ground almond meal, though, cause the first batch came out speckled brown.
