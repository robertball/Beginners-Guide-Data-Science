These were yummy and easy to make.  I used half panko because I love it, I also added butter buds because I add it to pretty much everything!! The kids loved them and told me to make them again and agian.  Other than the panko and butter buds I made the recipe exactly as called for.

I did make my own bread crumbs for this recipe. After cooking, I served it with a homemade jalapeno-cilantro ranch dressing. The grownups were lukewarm about it but the kids inhaled it. I'd make it again for them.

I made this according to the recipe. My entire family loved it. I cooked 3 lbs and this was enough for 5 people and lunch the following day for two teenagers. Thanks for a quick easy recipe.

Tender and moist with a nice crunchy exterior. Used panko mixed with 1-1/2 tablespoons Italian seasoning; omitted the salt; doubled the pepper & garlic powder. For the egg mixture, used light ranch dressing and added 1 teaspoon Frank’s Hot Sauce. Cut the chicken breasts into roughly 2" chunks instead of 1" cubes. It took about 25-30 minutes to cook. We made in two batches, and noticed the second batch was a bit more crunchy after turning off the oven but leaving them in w/ the door cracked open while eating the first batch. Both were really good but preferred the crunchier ones from the second batch. Used honey mustard and BBQ sauce for dipping rather than ranch dressing. We will make these again.

Great for crunchy chicken on salads.

I did make these with Creamy Italian dressing instead of ranch and I used Panko. I also added a dash of Cayenne Pepper and came away with a much more "adult" nugget. The original recipe is good too but these tasty treats will be perfect for Football Sundays :)

Used four skinned thighs, used Ken's Caesar dressing instead of ranch. Added onion and herb Mrs. Dash. Dredged chicken in seasoned flour first. Preheated pan with oil for about 5 minutes. Baked for 35 minutes turning halfway through.

I followed the directions exact except I cooked mine for 30 minutes.  The breading didn't stay on too well but that didn't stop my hubby and kids from eating them all up.  Hubby loved them the most.  I made homemade ranch and used fresh grated parmesan.  So good.  Thank you for sharing :)

So yummy.  I used whole chicken breasts and baked them longer.  My children inhaled it, which has never happened with anything I've made.

IM NEVER BUYING CHICKEN NUGGETS AGAIN! I LOVE YOU! I also love this website. I had leftover ranch from a veggie platter and chicken, so I put those two ingredients into this site and this recipe popped up! This was easy, cheap, and deliciously moist. The cooking time was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing! Thank you, this will be used ALOT in the future!

Very kid friendly.  My daughters love them.  I have also served them with pasta and sauce for a chicken parm type dish.  WOrks well with whole boneless breasts, 350 for 30min.

Very good.  Just a couple changes:  Used half panko, just because I love panko, and so then added a little Italian seasoning. I cut chicken into fingers instead of cubes.  Sprayed the top with cooking spray, thinking they might brown better. No such luck. So I broiled them to crisp them up for about 3 minutes on each side. Flavor was very good.  Not as good as fried but much better for you so I will make again.

The kids helped me make this and I'm pretty sure they are convinced these are the best chicken nuggets ever!  We used Italian Panko Bread crumbs, which were perfect and we were out of parmasean, but didn't feel like we missed it.  They were so tender and moist.

I made these for my two grandkids and they loved them.  My grandson said they were better than the fast food nuggets he always gets.  They asked me to make them all the time. I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I just used plain.  They were still great!

I'm not a fan of ranch, so I didn't use it, but even without it these were moist and flavorful.   My family loved it.

This is a fave among my chirruns. Yup, if I ask if they wanna contribute to the menu, it's usually MY chicken nuggies... sorry Crixxie, I claimed this one, too. LOL They're moist and that ranch gives it that extra yummy thing that makes everyone go mmmmmm. And ok, if someone asks for the recipe, I do leave the ranch part out. No one gets why their nuggies aren't as good as mine!!

I followed the directions, using fat free ranch, and increasing the garlic powder to a 1/4 tsp, we like our garlic! I also cooked for 30 minutes instead of the time recommended.  I found these to be tender, moist and really fantastic. Next time I might try the panko to change it up.  My kids really enjoyed these, and because I am currently dieting/trying to eat more healthy, I feel like the minor changes I made helped make this recipe more healhy.  Really yummy!

I didn't have ranch dressing, so I used creamy Italian instead. Came out fabulous. I used chicken tenders instead since they are much easier to chop up into pieces. I baked these for 30 minutes in my GE 24" gas range (there is no way you can bake these in 15 minutes unless you are chopping them up into micro pieces or baking it at a much higher setting). Came out perfect and moist for me.

Very good recipe! Quick, easy, and my family thought that it was nice to have homemade ones versus normal nuggets that you can get elsewhere. The ranch is subtle, but shines through nicely.

Definitely a keeper! Rather than doing nuggets or strips, I halved a breast lengthwise then pounded the halves thin. Baked the halves for 30 minutes. Very good and easy, which is a must for our weeknight dinners.

Left the recipe for my husband and kids to make. I had them cold. Still good but the coating was way to thick for me. But I'm sure that is just technique. I wonder if half panko would help that? Def make again

It tasted more like “Shake-n-Bake”. I thought this recipe sounded great and maybe for kids it would have been fine. I will try it once more but, I will consider frying the chicken so the coating sticks better.

YUM! Great kid food! After I made 3/4 of it per recipe, I added cayenne pepper to the egg/ranch for my husband. He's not a huge nugget fan, but he liked these.

I made these for lunch for my daughter. They were so delicious. I couldn't stop eating them and we had left overs for the next day. 5 star for sure

I made this recipe to find an alternative to frozen, processed chicken nuggets for my girls.  My entire family LOVED these nuggets.  My 5yr old asks for these weekly now!  I will be making these a family favorite from now on.  Thanks for sharing this great dish!!

Great recipe! I didn't change a thing and my husband loved it! I served it with macaroni salad.  This was a winner and I will definitely make this one again.

This was really good! Only things I changed were: I added 1/2 tsp of black pepper and garlic powder instead of the listed amounts- we like our spices! And I also cut the chicken breasts up a bit bigger, maybe 1.5-2" chunks instead of 1", and cooked for an additional 5 minutes or so. These came out so moist and tender, I'm pretty sure I'll be making this again real soon :)

We all liked these very much.  I made them with chicken tenders are they were very good.  Joanne is taking them to work and freezing any unused ones for another day.

Thanks for sharing the idea of blending egg and dressing. It made a great coating. I used frsh parm. How about Blue Cheese with hot sauce?
