Quartered the recipe (1lb bs breasts) and used 1 jalapeno instead of 1/4 serrano.  Juicy, but not as flavorful as we were expecting with all the interesting ingredients.

The family wasn't overly impressed.  The resounding response I heard was that it tasted like alcohol, and not in a good way.  With all the powderful flavors of garlic, serrano, thyme and lime we were expecting more of a punch and less of an edible drink flavor.  This isn't the chicken for us.  I scaled for 1 pound of chicken and used boneless, skinless chicken breast strips.

over powering flavor from the rum.  I used non range free chicken and it worked out.
