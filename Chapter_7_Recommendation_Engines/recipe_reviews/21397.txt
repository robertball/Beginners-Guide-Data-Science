I have made this recipe for years, but with 4 cups of COOKED rice, that is about 2 cups of uncooked rice.  Also, do not drain the canned mushrooms, and and rinse out the soup cans with a little water and add that. It is great!  Please try it again.

Ok, so the problem that everybody has is the "dryness" issue, but I think the recipe creator forgot to mention that you have to COVER the casserole before placing it in the oven. Just do that, and you'll have the most moist mushroom rice casserole, well done Rebecca, this is a keeper..!!

Why didn't I read the reviews before I made this recipe? I halved the recipe as I only wanted two servings and maybe some leftovers. As soon as I cooked the rice I realized I was in trouble. I doubled the amount of soup the recipe called for. I wish I'd mixed in some milk to add moisture, as the result was still somewhat dry.  The resulting rice mixture completely filled a 2 1/2 quart baking dish. Seems to me that somehow the recipe is off a bit, as I was only making half a recipe and the FULL recipe is supposed to fill a smaller dish. While this was a bit bland, there is hope for this recipe. IF I make it again, I will cook much less rice in chicken broth instead of water. I would also add some salt, pepper, and probably a little garlic.

I also cut the rice by 2 cups dry and added chicken boullion to the rice as it cooked. This way there's no need to add butter or a much smaller amt. if one chooses to.

I like the easy recipe.
I used cream of chicken soup instead.

My only complaint it the amount of butter required for this dish. I followed the advice of the previous posters to reduce the amount of rice because it may come out too dry... I dont know. Mine came out excessively buttery. So I guess, if you cut the rice, cut the butter!!! p.s. if anyone knows how to fix up the overpowering butter situation, let me know!

This recipe came out very good when I only added about 1 1/2 cups of rice and I also added mushrooms.

Really good pot-luck dish.  The almonds are a pleasant surprise to first-timers.

Pretty good, was kind of dry though.  Did not save well for leftovers.

Either increase the soup by a can or reduce the rice by a cup.  Was a little too dry.

You can get it to taste good if you change the amounts of just about every ingredient.  Then it is no longer this recipe.

I made this the other night and both my husband and I were disappointed.  I read the previous reviews about it being dry, so I added 2 extra cans of mushroom soup and it was still so dry. I think besides adding all that soup, you have to still reduce the rice amount.  I liked the idea of almonds, so I think this could be a real good recipe, once it gets tweaked a bit.  My husband thought that the almonds made the rice taste even more dry than it already tasted, but I liked the almonds quite a bit.  Thanks, will keep working w/ it til it comes out right.

I cut the rice down to three cups so it wouldn't be so dry and did not use mushrooms.  It was good, but could have used a little more flavor.

I'm almost certain I made it wrong (I'm not too experienced with cooking) but it still turned out great :) I halved the recipe and even without covering the dish when popping in the oven, it came out really moist. Not sure what I did, but I'll make this again in the future :)
