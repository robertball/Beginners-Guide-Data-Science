I just boil the pods down, strain, reduce again and keep in small jars. fridge or freeze.  Then just add sugar and water as needed with the ice.  that way I also have the plain puree for marinades and coatings for roast meat, or make chutney or any number of sauces.  Why limit yourself to just drinks??  And people can sweeten to taste.  I like it super sweet, my granddaughter loves it sour.  But it is a great drink in summer...I hope people try it.

I used 2 lbs. Omit the sugar directly to the pulp....I did the fruit Jarabe, "Simple Syrup." that's the best way and the only Mexican way, which goes along ways. Keep refrigerated.
