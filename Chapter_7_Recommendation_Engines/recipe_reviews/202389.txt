Great turkey burgers! I used a combination of red and green onion and added a 1/2 tsp. of smoked paprika and 2 Tbsp. of low sodium soy sauce. Instead of putting the cheese inside of the burger I just grilled them and melted the cheese over top. These burgers had a nice kick to them. These were very moist and very good - a healthy and nice change from regular beef burgers. Perfect on toasted whole grain rolls with lettuce, tomato and a dill pickle on the side!

Delicious turkey burgers!  Yum!  I made as is except for adding one egg white to help moisten and bind all ingredients together, and I topped with the pepper jack cheese instead of stuffing them.  Grilled outside on the gas grill, but laid down foil over the grate, since I've had lots of trouble with turkey burgers (especially moist ones) sticking before, even when sprayed with Pam.  Perfect solution!  I served these on homemade onion rolls (yum) with spicy ketchup!  Will make these again for sure.

Very good turkey burgers. I didn't have the time to pat out 8 patties then pat them together so I just melted the cheese on top and I had to sub the red pepper for green pepper.... These are the only changes I made and thought they were very good. As always I just eyeballed the seasonings. I thought these were great. Served with the Bushs new grilling beans black bean fiesta, went nicely together.

Really tasty, even though I modified somewhat based on what I had.  I did not use the cheese, but added about 1/3 cup SW style Egg Beater, and they held together fried in my cast iron pan.  I'll try the cheese next time.  Used garlic powder instead of fresh, extra green onion and no white, chipotle chile powder instead of cayenne, and a chopped roasted Hatch chile instead of red pepper.  Served on a corn tortilla roasted over open flame and with the Black Bean Medley that I made with some added chopped yellow squash - yummy.

This was ok but I feel it lacked some seasonings/spices. I love onions but think it may have been too much onions as well

I grilled these on the Foreman.  I was very surprised at how easy they were to make.   The two patties sealed together nicely without any problems.  I tried to jazz them up with all kinds of fancy condiments, but the meat is highly seasoned and we liked them best with plain old hamburger toppings.

wonderful flavor. burgers held together fine while cooking. i did cook them on medium heat to make sure the outside did not get done to fast and to keep the cheese from coming out. will make again and again. thanks for the recipe.

I promise you don't even need the egg! They will stay together, and the cheese in the center is kind of what makes them special. :)

Yummy...used all green onion instead of the 2 different onions, I also used extra lean ground chicken instead of turkey and also added some panko crumbs. Fresh cilantro is a must and is so refreshing I think. Topped with pickeled jalapeno slices. Grilled indoors and ate bunless. Very flavorful and healthy. Thanks!

I had enough mix for five large burgers.
They came out very moist, but even though I omitted the green onion and cut the amounts of cayenne pepper and cumin in half, these burgers were way too spicy for my husband and I. Grab the Tums!!  If I make them again I will OMIT the cayenne pepper and cumin and forget the green onions.

OMG! This is extremely mouthwatering!  I followed everything plus from another rater's comment to add egg whites. Sooo glad I did, my kids ate it in a flash who normally takes a lot of time to chew and swallow meat. This will definitely be on my to cook list from now on!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and thank you for the rater who suggested to add egg whites!

Two thumbs up on this one! I prepared the recipe exactly as listed and my boyfriend and son both thought they were awesome. As a matter of fact, my boyfriend says he wants these "burgers" from now on. I really didn't expect such a good response.

These were really good.  The turkey meat was kind of plain but the kick from the cheese inside helped spice it up.  It was great to not have to use an egg for the burgers. One piece of advise that I can share is don't use a Foreman Grill to make these.  I didn't want to pan fry them so I used the Foreman Grill and since it squeezes the meat together between two plates, the cheese went all over. If you do have to use one, leave the lid in an upright position or just be prepared for a cheese river.

These turkey burgers are moist and flavorful! However, I love spice, but a full tsp of cayenne was a bit too much for me in these. Next time I’ll use 1/2 tsp. Other than that, love this recipe and I’ll be making them again!

I added one teaspoon of salt, and it was too salty.  Next time I would cut it to 1/2 teaspoon.  They are quite spicy even without the addition of pepper, but we like spicy!  Teenage girl didn't like (no surprise), husband was OK, I loved the combo of flavors.  Ketchup worked nice on top.

Some changes I made were jalapeno peppers (1 tbsp) instead of cayenne, and I didn't have capers on hand.  And i used ground beef. To die for. So good.

Wow!  What an interesting, tasty flavor combination.  I did change this up based on what I had (only used 3 tablespoons of minced red onion, used a fresno pepper minced instead of the cayenne) and more cilantro (about 3 tablespoons because we love it).  We enjoyed the light heat of the fresno pepper with the fresh taste of cumin.  We had one with cheese and one without, both tasted wonderful.  I did top with fresh mashed avocado and then served with an ice cold corona with lime.  What a fantastic early summer meal.  We will definitely have this again and again. One tip that I find makes turkey burgers more juicy is to mix up the ingredients before hand then let sit in the refrigerator for a few hours.  Not only does this help them not fall apart, it allows the flavors time to blend.

Everyone enjoyed, sans bell pepper, green onion, stuffed cheese. Spicy enough w/out adding pepper jack. All used American slices on top. I added Jalepeno flakes on mine. Cooked on inside grill. Yum!

AMAZING! So much flavor and very moist. Even my beef-lovin hubby raved about these. I've tried other recipes before that were very good, but this will be the only way I make turkey burgers. I did add one egg white as others suggested but they became way too "mushy" to handle so I added a small amount of bread crumbs. It's been my experience that it all depends on the fat ratio in your turkey that affects whether or not to add extra water/egg. The more lean the turkey you will defiantely want to add to it, but if your turkey isn't the leanest then there is no need to add to it. My family prefers the "not-as" lean turkey. Thank you for sharing.

WOW!  I mean WOW! Turkey burgers are usually not that moist and not that appetizing; however this is sooo good. The flavor is really interesting. The cilantro really adds a fresh flavor. The cheese keeps it super moist. My kids hate meat, but they loves this meal. The cumin makes it zippy. This is becoming a weekly meal. It's also super easy to make.

YUM!  I doubled the cilantro, green onion, and red pepper because I love those flavors.  Very tasty and moist!  Some pepper jack cheeses have lots of peppers, so look for one that has the right amount for your taste.  You don't want to overwhelm this tasty burger!

Delicious!! I didn't need an egg either (from what I read from reviews, although it isn't even listed in the recipe...) These are the best-tasting turkey burgers I've ever made! Thanks for the great recipe!
