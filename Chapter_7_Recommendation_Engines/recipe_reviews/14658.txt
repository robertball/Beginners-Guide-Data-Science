I made this for 250 guests at my daughter's wedding reception. It got rave reviews.  I used frozen Costco meatballs but used the sauce recipe.(60 meatballs per batch) Chili sauce was quite expensive, so I substituted 2/3 catsup and 1/3 chili sauce. It tasted the same.(check the ingredients, almost identical)  I made them in advance, and froze into gallon ziplock freezer bags. Then just re-heated and they were AWESOME!  I have had several phone calls since reqesting the recipe. Thanks for the recipe Tammy!

I made this recipe yesterday for a dinner party and it all went!!  I have requests to make it for the upcoming Super Bowl and I had to email 5 copies of the recipe to friends.  I used Sam's Club frozen meatballs and browned them in a little bit of soy sauce and a can of Dole pineapple chucks w/the syrup.  While they were browning, I whisked together the Heinz Chili sauce, Smucker's grape jelly and the lemon juice.  After that came to a boil I poured it over the meatballs in the pan and let simmer for 20-30 minutes.  They were ready to go after that.  I would have followed the crock pot directions but I woke up too late to start it in the crock pot.  I think this will be the way I cook them from now on.  Hope this is helpful:-)

Ok have to admit it, despite very few bum steers from this group, I though you people were crazy, chili sauce and jelly?  But needed something for office potluck, took in my slow cooker, frozen meatballs and heated them up in the sauce for a few hours then put out with all the other offerings.  They were great and the only item that went completely and were raved about!  A couple of the guys wanted me to make more and bring them in the next day!  2 thumbs up!

I thought this was very easy to prepare and tastes good.  I gave it only 4 stars because you really need to brown the meatballs in the oven or in a frying pan first.  Then they won't crumble in the crock pot.

Try using whole berry cranberry sauce instead of grape jelly, it's awesome!

It doesn't get much easier than this, and it was very good. I cut the recipe in half because I was only using 1 lb of ground beef. The sauce was quite tangy so I added a little extra grape jelly, as my husband prefers more sweet than sour.  He and the kids liked these a lot.  For the meatballs, I made my own using 1 lb ground beef, 1 egg, 1/4 c bread crumbs, 3/4 tsp seasoned salt, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1 TBS dried onion flakes.

These were quite good.  I used a 2-lb bag of precooked, frozen appetizer meatballs which was very convenient.  I occasionally basted the top layer of meatballs to keep them moist since they were above the "sauce line" in the crock pot. Our oldest son especially liked these.

Don't be afraid of the grape jelly!  It gives the meatballs an excellent sweetness without tasting like grapes.  My 5 year old ate 4 helpings!!!  Tastes almost as well with frozen meatballs as with making fresh ones, which is a real time saver when I am in a hurry.

Pretty good. My daughter didn't like it, but she doesn't like sweet and sour. The bottle chili sauce can be found in the condiment area. It tastes like thick ketchup. Add 1 small container pineapple. I would mince the onion in a food processor, too. Serve with catonese dinner.

These were fabulous!  I made them for a church function and they were all gone.  I used 70 Costco frozen meatballs (half the bag), 2-12oz jars of chili sauce (Food Lion brand was all I could get), 1.5 cups of grape jelly and almost one can of crushed pineapple!  OMG good!!!  I put them in the crockpot at 10am, and got home at 2pm.  Cooked on low.  They were done!  The meatballs tasted like the frozen meatball I am used to.  I didn't need them until 5pm though, so just left them on low to cook another two hours.  Boy did this change them!  They ended up SO tender and good, changed the taste to more of a homemade taste and the sauce was just perfect.  Wasn't too thin at all, or too thick.  Didn't taste BBQish to me at all, which I feared..not a fan.  So, I will always just cook on low for 6 hours from now on.

I have been making this recipe for years with excellent results. I make the meatballs with 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 lean ground beef mixed with egg, little oatmeal for binding, garlic, onion, parsley or whatever I have on hand and then gently "brown" the meatballs on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. I then drain off excess fat and cool them enough to handle before adding them (couple at a time) to the crockpot with the already warm sauce and heat on low for a couple hours, giving them a gentle "toss" once or twice. Thank you for reminding me of this wonderful and easy recipe.

This is a recipe that I have used for many, many years and actually have just been recently handing it out again to new friends!  It is the easiest, quickest recipe and is a *go-to* for me.  I love the review that suggests switching the cranberry sauce for the grape jelly - I'm going to try that using turkey meatballs for the Holiday Season!  Thanks!

Save yourself some time and buy pre-made (and pre-cooked) meatballs... we like the ones from WalMart in the freezer section.  This was a strange list of ingredients but these babies are addictive.  Made them for a Super Bowl party and they vanished!  Throw everything in the crockpot and you're good to go.

20 years ago I used to make this as meatballs without the lemon juice.  Then we decided we liked it too much to putz around with the balls, I started making it as meatloaf and setting the sauce on the side.  Today I am known far and wide for my meatloaf.  The sauce is also good on baked potatoes.

I have been making this recipe for years and was happy to see it here.  I have made it with all types of jelly including, peach, apricot, and fig so use whatever you have on hand.  Try and stay away from jellies that have fruit chunks in it though because the sauce never tastes as good for some reason.  Anytime I have a potluck to go to this is what I make and it always disappears.  We live in North Africa now and I still make them whenever I have the right ingredients.  You cannot go wrong with these meatballs they are a winner every time.

Followed the recipe exactly. At four hours, my meatballs (about 1" across) were dried out. Also, the glaze was watery and really didn't stick to the meat at all. For this to work, the cooking time needs to be at least an hour shorter, and the sauce thicker.   I will not be making this recipe again.

Have this cooking right now.  Smells good but the sauce is soooo sweet.  I  am adding vinegar, sour salt, and lemon juice.  Hope it turns out ok.  I have had this before and usually I like it.  I had to make more sauce so added some ketchup and sweet Asian chili sauce.  That maybe what is what pushed it over the edge with being too sweet.

I've been making these for YEARS!   i make my meatballs w/ a couple of slices of bread soaked in milk, about 1/3 c. of itallian bread crumbs, italian seasoning, a pinch of garlic powder.  sometimes i omit the garlic powder and drizzle EVOO and put slivered garlic on the baking pan to bake in oven.  i've never used the lemon juice but there isn't a morsel left in the crockpot when i make these!!!   SCRUMPTIOUS!  and so easy!

Loved this!!! I read the other reveiews and browned my meatballs so they wouldnt fall apart. I used onion soup and bread crumbs for the meat seasoning. I have tasted this sauce before and knew that it could be a little sweet, so I added some chili powder and a little tabasco. It turned out great!

I did not like this recipe at all!  Meatballs were tasteless (I noticed the "rave reviews" used frozen store bought meatballs, might be better).  The sauce got really thick & sticky fast & just did not like the flavor at all!

I made this using the meatballs from the BBQ Glazed Homemade Meatballs recipe because I could tell that the ones in this recipe would be really plain.  The sauce part and the crock pot method I did follow though :)  My slight change was to pour about 1/4 of the sauce into my 4 quart crock pot, add a layer of meatballs, drizzle with another 1/4 of the sauce, top with the rest of the meatballs, and pour the rest of the sauce on top.  This way I didn't have to stir and my meatballs remained intact.  They were fully cooked after 3 1/2 hours so I removed the lid, stirred, and let it cook with the lid off for half an hour while I prepared the rest of the dinner.  It was really runny at first but after letting some of the liquid cook off, the sauce had the perfect consistency!!  And it tastes really great, too.  You'd never think it's only jelly and chili sauce.  I made this once before on the stove ("Cocktail Meatballs I") and we weren't huge fans, the sauce was really strong and really sweet.  The sauce is definitely better when made in the crock pot for some reason.  And a great way to use up jelly if you have lots of it like we do!

These are great!  I followed the advice of a few others and used only 3/4 cup of grape jelly and they turned out wonderful!  And if you're making a really large quantity, I went to a restaurant supply store and bought a 7lb can of chili sauce for about $4.

This was the best meatball recipe. I used 1.5kg of meat, 2 cups grape jelly and 2 cups of sweet chili sauce. I needed to add 2 cups breadcrumbs for the meatballs to stick together. I found there to be too much onion as well, even with 1.5kg of meat. But the results were fantastic

These were amazing!  Everyone went back for seconds and thirds!  I did however, omit the onions completely and I used ready-made meatballs.

The only trouble I had with these was getting them to stay together. Any stirring at all in the crockpot made them fall apart, but the taste was fabulous. My family really scarfed these up!

Always a crowd pleaser! I use frozen meatballs. The longer the sauce cooks down & meatballs glaze - the better they taste.

Have made this recipe several times and it is delicious.  Instead of making the meatballs myself, I add one half bag of italian meatballs (Kirkland brand) and cook on low for 3.5-4 hours.   The last time I made this recipe I was short 1/4 cup of grape jelly, and the batch actually turned out MUCH better than previous as it was slightly less sweet and the flavor of the chili sauce was more prevalent, which all preferred.  Will make it this way from now on.

I make a similar version except I use salsa 16 oz of salsa vs chili sauce and 16 oz of jelly or equal parts jelly to salsa if you use the store brought meatballs.

I tried this one out of curiosity.  Grape jelly and chili sauce.  What!?  It was soo good.  The first time I did it I made the meatballs and the second I used frozen.  Both were awesome.  I did make a substitution.  I think I read a review where they used pineapple juice instead of lemon.  Well I took a can of pineapple chunks and dumped it in juice and all.  When it was close to done I added constarch to thicken it.  Now that is only because I added more liquid than the recipe called for.  My family loved having pineapple as well as meatballs to eat with thier rice.  This recipe is a keeper.  It's also been a great way to get rid of this generic grape jelly I bought that is so sweet it's yucky.  It's great in the recipe.  Thanks for this one.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I rated this four stars simply because the meatballs were a little more sweet than sour.  I would probably add an additional tsp of lemon juice.  I also substituted using 1/3 cup Hot Garlic Chili sauce and 2/3 cup Ketchup.  Overal this meal was great and will definitely make again.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I make little smoky cocktail sausages in the same sauce and they are delicious.
Denise, grape jelly is like grape jam made from juice instead of whole or pureed fruit.  I bet you're from the UK or Australia?
Good recipe!

My mom has been making these for Christmas parties as long as I can remember.  It doesn't matter if you make meatballs or turkey balls, the sauce is what counts! Even with so few ingredients, people can never pinpoint what is in this uncommonly tasty sauce!

I used half jar grape jelly and half apricot preserves (since grape jelly was too sweet) and it was amazing! I also precooked and browned the meatballs first in the oven, then placed them in the crockpot with the jellies and chili sauce. I think this helps the meatballs from crumbling in the crockpot.

These are so good!!!  I make my own meatball recipe but, love the chili sauce and grape jelly.  I do bake my meatballs first which I think is important.  Throw them in the crock pot and they are a party favorite every time.  I am always asked to bring them to get togethers.  :)

Just made these and LOVE em!  I didn't have a problem with the meatballs falling apart at all.  They taste great.  I wouldn't call them spicy per se, just a perfect tasting meatball.  They're really easy to make.  We're having meatball subs tonight but I think they'd be great in spaghetti too.

This was very good, mostly sweet though. I will definately make them again ,it was soo easy. I was lazy and used premade meat balls and let them sit over night in the sauce to soak in.

Bringing these tomorrow to a holiday office potluck.  I tripled the recipe, substituted onion powder and flakes for the onions, added garlic powder and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs to the meatballs, which I baked for approx. 15 min.  They will marinate overnight in the fridge (in the crock pot) and hopefully soak up even more of the wonderful sweet/tangy flavors I couldn't resist trying out tonight!  Thanks for a quick and easy crowd-pleaser (I'm hoping.....!!)

This is one of those easy recipes almost everyone loves, and it's one of my potluck standbys if I'm too busy for fancier fare. I've made it with a combination of meatballs and sliced kielbasa, which disappeared in minutes. I've also made it with cranberry sauce in place of the grape jelly.

This recipie is so eay and wonderful. The first time I ever had this, was at a friends house and they used frozen meatballs. I loved the sauce, hated the meatballs. I just do not like the frozen taste. I used this recipe and loved it. The only thing I did differently was to grate the onion into the ground beef

This recipie was so easy.  And it tastes great.  I fried the meatballs before I put them in the slow cooker.  It made them stay together as I was worried they would fall apart after 5 hours in the slow cooker.  I would not cook them anymore than 5 hours though...they were done by that time and too delicious to wait any longer to eat them.

This is a good basic recipe but way to sweet.  I'd definitely brown them first, otherwise they get crumbly.  I also added about 3 tablespoons of white vinegar to give it some tang and some dashes of hot sauce.  It cut down on the sweetness.  Next time, I will definitely add less jelly.

We thought it was just a bit too sweet. I doubled the original sauce recipe for a 40 oz bag of frozen meatballs and it was the correct amount of sauce for the number of meatballs. I added 8 oz of Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo wing sauce and it made the sauce less sweet & more spicy. We loved it!

I used turkey as a substitute for the meat and browned the meatballs the night before then finished cooking them the next morning in the sauce.

Nice & easy, but the meat was really flavorless. Seems like it improved after being refrigerated for a day & also sitting in some spices I added to it in order to give it a more well-rounded flavor. It might be a great sauce with pre-made meatballs or some with a little more life.

They were a bit sweet -I would recommend cutting back on the grape jelly -possibly in half.   I like sweet but these were even sweet for me.  But otherwise great, yummy, thanks for the recipe!!

I used regular ground beef, and followed the directions to a tee except for a squirt of ketchup to make up for having a bit less chili sauce. 4 hours in the slow cooker (we couldn't wait any longer)
They tasted great! The sauce looked very watery, but what was coated the meatballs was just awesome.

I was torn about how to rate this recipe.  Personally, I would probably give it 2 stars.  I made it for a potluck luncheon at work and everyone seemed to like it (a 4?) so I compromised with 3 stars.  The sauce is almost BBQ-ish, but not quite.  I thought it was way to sweet, so maybe I will cut down on the grape jelly a bit next time.  I can't quite put my finger on it...the taste was interesting, but I didn't love it.

This recipe was a big hit with my husband and myself. I'll have to admit I was very leary about how chili sauce and grape jelly would taste together, but it is awsome. I took the advice of one of the other reviews and i used a can of pinapple chunks with syrup and a tad of soy sauce and browned the meatballs first then poured over the sauce, it only took about 30 minutes to cook versus 4 to 5 hours if you are looking for a quick meal that is great this is it! Also good served over white rice.

my meatballs came out great but the sauce was just ok-i used a sweet and spicy chili sauce i already had on hand-so with the sweetness of the jelly, it was just way too sweet. my fiance liked it though! and plus because i used this particular kind of chili sauce, the sauce overall was much too greasy. i say just go with the exact recipe and don't tweak it much.

Another wonderfully easy tasty dish. Next time I will serve it over rice.
I did bake them for 20 minutes before placing in crockpot, and did not need to cook as long as the 4-5 hours.

Excellent recipe!  I had one years ago, too, but lost it.  I do recall I browned the meatballs first before placing them in the slow cooker (to take to party later). That recipe called for a can of jellied cranapples with the chili sauce, cause I remembered thinking "yuk" of the two. It was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was very easy! We ate it with white rice. It was a big hit with our 16 month old. My husband and I thought the sauce was a little too sweet! I left on low the whole day instead of high, I also used the ready made meatballs from Costco! Yummy!

This was an excellent recipe.  After reading previous reviews, I decided to add some bread crumbs in my meatballs and brown them up in the oven abit before I put in slow cooker.  Worked perfectly.

I made this with just a few minor adjustments. I left the onion out but added two small bell peppers. One red and one yellow, mostly for color. Eliminated the salt and added a can of chunked pineapple with the juice. Brought chili sauce,grape jelly, peppers and pineapple with juice to a boil. Reduced heat added a bag of frozen meatballs and simmered for 25 mins.

I made this for my daughters party and has been requested for another of her parties. we used frozen meatballs which safes a lot of time and is very tasty.  It is also great with broad noodles and a salad ( my husband likes to have).    It was a hit with the grandkids also and they want it eveytime we visit.  thank you for a great recipe.

Years ago, my mom made this recipe. Our family absolutely LOVE them. Unfortunately,I had lost her recipe, so I went on line to hunt for it. Here it was!!!! 
I would HIGHLY recommend these. I am using Ground Turkey instead of Beef (healthier). But otherwise everything is the same.

We liked this very much. I made as directed but used frozen meatballs because I had a bag of them in the freezer. I baked them first and heated the sauce in a pan. They only needed about 2 hours in the crock-pot. Served with buttered egg noodles. Will make again!

Made for Super Bowl and these were AWESOME!  The grape flavor was a little strong but in all fairness I didn't measure it I just dumped 2/3 of the container in.  To compensate I added vinegar to cut the sweetness and some ketchup.  Also added a small can of pineapple chunks.  Had with some rice but would prefer with egg noodles.  Will try next time with green and red peppers.  Thanks for sharing...definitely a KEEPER!

ok I followed the directions, including the 4 to 5 hrs on high in a crock pot. Bad mistake, they were burnt beyond being able to eat. The only thing I can say is I tasted them about 2 hrs in and they tasted good then, so tonight I am trying this recipe again.  But will not cook as long or as high temp as 1st time. I will not trust leaving them alone just because they are in a crock pot.  I gave this a 3 star just because I liked what i tasted initially, but in following the recipe the cooking time was off. I will post again after today.

More spicy than sweet and sour.  I added onions, green peppers and pineapple to the sauce... Still way more Mexican flavored than sweet and sour.

Sorry, I did not like how the meatballs were swimming in fat after cooking. This made me throw away the sauce. This is unfortunate because it was probably good. I will try this recipe again by first baking the meatballs to get rid of the unecessary grease and then using the crockpot with the sauce.

Awesome recipe, used frozen meatballs for the neighbours potluck, and they turned out great. I doubled the batch to be sure there was enough and they were all gone! Will make again!

This was soo good! The first time I made it, I listened to other reviews and reduced the jelly by 3/4 cup.It tasted okay but didn't fit my taste buds. The next time I made it, I did exactly as the recipe stated. It was a whole lot better! Just what I was looking for.

I served this for 30 hungry College kids at a party at my home and they LOVED it.  So simple but so good.  I doubled the recipe and it was great.  Gave this recipe to my mom this morning.  Teriffic.

I don't think this should be in the slow cooker very long, just long enough so that the sauce ingredients blend and are absorbed into the meatballs a little.  My slow cooker must cook hot, because this was much too long of a cooking time.

I couldn't wait for 4-5 hours so I cooked a few in the skillet. Very good! I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of Bob Evans original recipe sausage instead of the 2 lbs of beef. I didn't have chili sauce so I made some using 1 cup of campbells tomato juice, 2 tablespoons vinegar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and about a teaspoon of mixed chili powder and crushed Italian seasonings. I also added maybe an 1/8 of a cup of chinese sweet and sour chili sauce (like what they you for spring rolls) I can't wait for the rest of them to finish!

Just too sweet with a definite kick to it! I didn't have enough sauce in the slow cooker so I added some red wine, oh and I did add breadcrumbs to the meatballs.  It was just not what I was hoping for a meal, it will be a good apetizer for a party though.

Made the recipe as specified, but subbing in vegan substitutes for meat and egg.  Had to add some breadcrumbs to try and get the meatballs to remain meatballs, but they fell apart in the slow cooker anyway.    Despite how that turned out, the taste itself was wonderful.

These meatballs were a hit! I personally didn't care for the sauce but I made these for a party and everyone loved them! I bought meatballs from costco(140ct) and doubled the sauce recipe. I browned the meatballs in a frying pan with crushed pineapple and onions. Tastes great without the sauce also!

Pretty good recipe. I will make again trying the following alterations; add some worchestershire sauce as well as a generous sprinkle of cayenne pepper to the chili sauce mixture.

This recipe was good, and was very easy, however it seemed to be lacking something...not quite sure what though.  I will make again, but less jelly, and maybe a different type of chili sauce.

Very Yummy!  Freeze the rest for later! Good little snacks for watching tv.  Also can serve over rice.

Ymmy... I didn't have lemon juice so I added pineapple and a little liquid braggs (taste like soy sauce). Used 1Tbs corn starch mixed in a little cold water to thicken sause before serving.  Served over pasta.

Excellent!  I served it with some friends and they all loved it!  I did follow the suggestions and used 3/4C of the grape jelly. It's quick and easy to prepare and I will make it again!

I just made these last night and my husband really liked them. Instead of using an onion, I used a packet of lipton onion dry soup mix and mixed that into the beef. It gave it a great taste!

I didnt care for this at all. The jelly made it too sweet, even though it was also spicy. Also the recipe called for too much onion.

We have an upcoming wedding, so I made a small batch and had 5 friends doing tasting. Everyone of them voted for this recipe. I won't tell you they're look when they found out how they were made.  Try them, you can't go wrong.

The meatballs were very dry, which was surprising.  I had to add flour to the sauce to make it thicker.  Was too watery.  Sorry, but will look for a different recipe.

Thank you, thank you, thank you...I used to make this all the time as an appetizer.  Goes over real well at pot lucks and tastes great over rice or noodles.  I had lost the recipe and it so nice to find it again.

I had these at a Superbowl party and they were a huge hit.   I made them for a party over the weekend and they went so fast that people were complaining there weren't more!  If you need a really really quick appetizer, make this with store bought meatballs, throw everything in the crock pot and viola!

I was given this recipe years ago and I think it's one of the best ever. My recipe calls for either chili or taco sauce which gives you a choice of the sour selection. It's always a winner in my home.

Made this last night at basic recipe it's ok a little bland. So to the sauce I added 1 red bell pepper, 1 green pepper and can of pineapple chunks and about 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes. Also made sauce stovetop due to run late but will try crockpot version next. My husband and 6 year old loved it. Served with white basmati rice.

VERY easy. I made it while at a conference in a hotel. mixed it right in the crock pot 6 hours before the room party. I used one bottle of ketchup, one of chile paste and half a bottle of jelly for my back of 140 meatballs. I used the italian style cuz that's all they had, but plain would be better.

This recipe was pretty good and went over well at a party I had recently.  I used pre-cooked meatballs because they're just so much easier and sugar free jelly.  This was a nice change to the normal barbeque variety you find frequently for appetizers.

I browned the meatballs in the oven first to remove the fat and substituted the chili sauce with barbecue sauce. I omitted the lemon and threw it all in the crockpot at low for 2 hrs. Just as good as those prepared packaged meatballs.

Very easy to make.  Has a BBQ-y taste.  Good flavor, but a little greasy.  Next time, I will finely mince the onions rather than chopping them.  I served them over rice as our main dish.

I made these for a fire dept dinner and they went over well. I also used frozen meatballs. I cooked them in the oven according to the package directions and made the sauce while they were cooking. When the balls were done I put them in the sauce and heated them through for about 15 or 20 minutes. I did as others suggested and just used 3/4 of a cup of the jelly. They were very good. Thank u for the recipe!

I took this to a family gathering and it was a big hit.  I brought about 60 meatballs for 12 people and they disappeared! I added a few drops of liquid smoke.  Next time I think I'll use a little less jelly and a little more chili sauce/ketchup and more smoke because I thought they were just a bit too sweet.

This recipe tasted great, but I needed to add a few ingredients. I added oatmeal to the beef and needed much more sauce. I used the sauce as directed but added ketchup, brown sugar, and vinegar to double the amount of sauce. With a doubled amount, it was just right. Also, I felt that straight chili sauce would be too spicy for some family members; the ketchup cooled it down.

I cooked mine 8 hours because I had to go to work. BIG MISTAKE! They were dry and had a burnt flavor. Yuck. Might have been good if I cooked them for less time as in the recipe.

very good. I took the advice and added bread crumbs and browned in the oven. The meatballs stay together. All three of my teenagers loved them.

I use the sauce recipe with frozen meatballs in a pinch. Always turns out great. This is my most requested pot luck dish.
