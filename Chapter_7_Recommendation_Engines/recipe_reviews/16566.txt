Took the advice from other reviewers and doubled up on this yummy recipe plus added a can of "healthy" cream of mushroom soup. Didn't use the celery but used green pepper and asparagus. Some garlic and onion powder added to the flavor. Once assembled I shredded cheddar cheese on top and sprinkled with bread crumbs and dotted with butter. The whole family loved it!

I enjoyedthis very much. But being me I can never leave anything alone. I added a 1/2 tsp. dry mustard powder and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to the sauce and mixed cheese with bread crumbs in my food processor with another 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. That takes care of bland very nicley.

Followed recipe except cooked a little more noodles.  Threw in one half a small can of mushrooms I had left over, left out the water as recommended and added the can of creme of mushroom soup!  My husband raved about it and he does not usually go for "leftovers".  Definately a keeper!!

This is perfect for left over chicken.  I doubled everything, but the noodles, which I tripled, and it fed my family of four.  Very tasty.

It was okay...I added fresh mushrooms and a can of cream of chicken soup still a little bland for my taste. probably will make again and try some different ingredients and more spice.

Yep, this will come in handy again.  It was a hit with both my husband, who loves comfort food, and my 2-year-old son.  I didn't have any ham, so I used just leftover chicken.  The celery didn't have a chance to soften, so next time I'll saute it first. I also used whole wheat flour, which worked fine.  I doubled the recipe, too, but only served half for dinner, so now I've got leftover leftovers!

This was a great way to use leftovers.  I thought the portions were rather small.  I added peas and mushrooms to the mix, increased the amount of meat, made an additional cup of white sauce, and made more noodles.

I happened to have all the ingredients in the house when I saw this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and tripled the noodles and it fed 4 of us nicely with a spinach salad on the side.  I will probably add some onions and brocoli the next time I make this.  I didn't find it bland at all.

This was my first real disappointment on this website!  It was very bland and the proportions were all messed up - no way that 1/2 c of noodles was going to serve 4 people!  I won't make this again.

My family loved this. Very easy and quick. Like some of the other reviewers, I would add more sauce and pasta, maybe even increase the meats (for a recipe that was scaled to serve 4 adults, the portions were quite small).  Excellent!

This is a great casserole, especially if you are not a casserole type family. I substituted carrots for celery and added diced onions. That's why it's so great, just put anything in it.

Very yummy! Replaced the milk with a can of mushroom soup. Added a chopped onion, chives, and terragon. Did not have celery, but turned out great! This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe we have made it several times.  I always like to add more to it to make it go farther.  And be sure to make lots of the gravy you don't want to dry it out.

I read several times that this recipe would not feed 4 people--well it says it serves 2.  Which I was looking for.  I used spinach noodles, sauted onion, yellow pepper & mushrooms.  Made the white sauce as read.  Added toasted slivered almonds.  Did use Panko--as I always do for bread crumbs on top of anything.  Didn't taste like leftovers at all!  Even some left over for hubby's lunch tomorrow.  Worked for me!

Definitely a keeper! Had to make twice in 3 days! Using hints from previous reviews: added 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, sliced fresh mushrooms; doubled the noodles; added 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup. BIG hit!!!!

This was a really good comfort food!  Even hubby liked it and he is not a casserole person.  I did take some other reviewers suggestions.  I added garlic powder, dry mustard and crushed red paper flakes (didn't have cayenne pepper) to the the milk mixture.  Then I added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I didn't have any celery so I used some leftover green beans and wax beans for color.  I also used panko flakes/bread crumbs with the cheese mixture.  A keeper in our house!!!

The quantities in this recipe are ridiculous - 1/4 cup meat and 1/8 cup noodles per serving? Maybe the 1/16 cup chopped celery is what makes it so great? Does anybody review these recipes before they are posted?

Great dish and very creamy.  I doubled up on the sauce to make a bit more and to make it richer.  I bet it would be awesome with tuna as well!

This was very good. I used steamed broccoli and carrots for celery. Doubled the sauce with 2 c. of dry past possibly could of been tripled. Threw in some parmesan cheese. Kids really enjoyed it.

I thought this was really yummy. I just used ham (trying to get rid of some leftovers).  I added a little cheese to the "sauce" after it had thickened up (a little velveeta because that's what I had). Also added some seasoning to the white sauce (paprika, red pepper, black pepper).  This was a hearty, comforting sort of casserole. Very good!

I get amused at the reviews.  Some change them so much that there is  littleof the original left.  I substituted the equivalent of !/2 package of leftover cheese mac with burger for the noodles, added cream of chicken soup for the sauce, left out the chicken, added sauteed onion and broccoli and celery, topped with cream of chicken soup and Panko bread crumbs, shredded cheddar,ample pepper and paprika, baked in medium dish for 30 minutes then a little longer, then served.  Everyone liked it.  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks so much.

This was just ok, I doubled the recipe since it didnt look like it would make very much.  Only other changes I made were I sauted some onion and mixed that in and left out the celery.  I wish I had added a cream of broccoli soup or cream of chicken.

It turned out good, but I felt as though there was too much ham. I will make it again, put next time, I would use less ham (maybe half the amount indicated) and more egg noodles.

Good flavor, but no way does this recipe make 4 adult size servings.  I doubled the recipe, and tripled the noodles, and it still fit easily into a 8" x 8" (2 quart) baking dish!

The only thing I did different was that I sauted the celery, as my family doesn't like it crunchy.

I like the combination of ham and chicken flavors together.

This is a good casserole recipe.  Based on advice of other reviewers I adjusted the quantities (doubled ingredients and tripled noodles for 4 servings).  I like the fact that you can play around with different ingredients and it will still come out great!  I took out the celery b/c my hubby doesn't like it.  I instead put in a sliced carrot, 1/2 lb chopped mushrooms and 1 small minced onion.  Next time I will add 1 can of cream of mushroom to make the broth more liquid.  Thanks for a good base recipe!

This recipe was delicious and my husband loved it. It was very easy and it definitly a keeper. I am watching my weight so I did replace the flour with whole wheat flour, used whole wheat egg noodles, and used reduced fat chedder cheese. It turned out great.

This is a nice, easy dish that tastes great.  I used smkoed turkey and ham, which gave it a nice smoky flavour.  My only problem was that the servings were quite small - next time, I'll double the recipe to serve four adults.

Thought I would try this, as I needed to use up some leftover ham and chicken.  It turned out ok although very creamy which didn't appeal and also it lacked something, but not sure what.  My husband loved it however but I told him to enjoy, as he won't be seeing it on the table again. ;-)

This turned out very good. I used about 2 cups of cooked noodles, 1 cup chicken, and 1 cup ham. I also added 1 cup of frozen mixed vegetables. With those changes, it's a good meal for two people. I lowered the calorie count by using skim milk and fat free cheese. Still tasted great! The paprika adds a nice flavor.

After reading all of the good reviews, I chose not to believe the not-so-good ones. But this recipe most definitely was too bland for my taste, even after I added more spices than listed. The broccoli I added gave it most of it's flavour really, so that's not saying much. I'll be looking for a different recipe next time..

My husband isn't a big fan of chicken.  I doubled the recipe.  I added velvetta cheese to the butter, flour and milk and poured over ham, chicken and sauteed onions.  Deleted the noodles and served over rice. Tasted like chicken cordon blue.

Most of my family enjoyed it. I like how versitile it is.  You can add whatever you have available to enhance it. I added a can of peas to get a veggie in. The measurement for the egg noodles is a bit off though. I used at least 5 times the amount of noodles.

I thought this was pretty good! The only problem for me was that I didn't have any leftover chicken, so I had to cook some up & that added a lot to my overall cooking time. (It probably ended up taking me 1 hr & 15 minutes to get this ready....that's a little long with children running under foot.) I doubled the recipe & also added some green onions that I had handy & that gave it nice flavor. Also I substituted turkey-ham for pork-ham. This was a good all around casserole for dinner & my 2 year old even ate it!!

Thought it could use a little more flavoring, was kind of bland.  However, I'm still going to use the recipe and play around with it a little bit.

This was a hit with my family.  My husband ate half the dish by himself!  My 8 and 6 year old ate it well too. I added the cream of mushroom recommended by others and liked it!

This was an excellent recipe, very good flavor!  I increased the amounts as suggested by other reviewers, and added mustard powder, and a bit of red pepper.  Delicious, I will definitely make this again!

Good basic cassarole, but much better with a sauted onion.  Add whatever vegetables happen to be around.  I used mushrooms and peas.

This is a lot like tuna casserole for some reason. I really liked it. My fiance not so much. He could do without me ever making it again. The difference is our tastes. It does seem as though it is missing something though, possibly a vegetable. I also added onion to it which blended well.

Feel sorry for all the "new" cooks who wouldn't realize that the quantities of ingredients weren't scaled correctly to feed the number of servings.  Not too bad after all was corrected.

Oh my goodness...this was the best and easiest casserole I've had in ages. Made the recipe exactly as stated and have saved it in my own personal recipe book as I plan to make this many, many more times. Maybe next time I just may add a few more veggies to the mix just to experiment but this recipe  totally stands on it's own for sure. Love!

I added mushrooms and used arborio rice and gouda cheese.  It was great. This recipe can be amended and changed in many ways. Cheese can vary, meats can change, a dash of white wine or broth would work. Red or green peppers could be added for some color. I also used an iron skillet for sautéing and for baking--cuts down on pots needed. I made rice but this would be a good use for rice left over from Chinese carry-out.

I thought this was much better than I was expecting. I cooked an onion and garlic in a pan with no oil and did add it into the mixture. I also added dry mustard, oregano and cayenne pepper. I had to use spaghetti noodles because that's all I had. And I did add the can of mushroom soup like many suggested.  The only ham I had was sliced deli ham but I used some of it and I liked it.

It wasn't bad.  It needs more "spice" in my opinion.  I added a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, from the advice of a previous reviewer, and also added some mixed vegetables.  I may make this again but add more things here and there to add more taste to it.

This was good but not great.  I felt that the recipe had 3 flaws - too much ham, too much sauce and not enough noodles. Thankfully I had cooked extra noodles so I added them in but it still wasn't enough.  And the ham overpowered the dish...it's all I could taste.  I might make again but will modify accordingly.  Couldn't eat it again as written.

This is a good casserole to use up leftovers.  In my case, I used all ham in the recipe.  I increased the ingredients to make servings for 6 as I wanted to freeze a small casserole dish.  This dish came together easily and was enjoyed by my family.  I would make this again if I had ham and or chicken to use up.  I served this with lettuce salad and green beans.
