How can anyone properly make these chicken wings without knowing what temperature is required for the oil or an approximation of cooking time?

I thought this was well worth the marinating time.  I can't imagine using sliced meat.. but I used small chicken drumsticks and they were awesome!

My husband and I did not care for the taste of this chicken.  It had a smokey taste to it, which we do not care for anything smoked.  I would not make this again.

Everyone loved these! I cut the wings into pieces, discarding the tips. I was only able to marinade them for 1 hour, vaccuum packed (which is supposed to cut down the marinade time). They were the best fried chicken I've ever made.

Good, but salty!  Either cut back on the soy, use low sodium soy or just omit the salt altogether.  I didn't have time to marinade, I just dredge the chicken into the sauce and "breaded" it.  I also added freshly grated ginger and it was a nice addition.

Tried it, and my first thought as a non-professional cooker was: wow, I did that ?

Except that I used not chicken but slices of turkey. The perfect time to leave them in the fryer would be 6,5 minutes.

Recommended as side dish should be e.g. potatoes, as this dish can be very fat due to frying.

Didn't enjoy these taste of these, kind of bland. Glad I didn't have company over. Were better reheated.

My family and I thought these were very good. I didn't get to marinate them as long as called for, just a couple of hours. I added a touch of corn meal instead of flor, but caught myself and used the corn flour [I was just eye balling it]. I added a few spices to the flour, salt, paprika [hot] garlic powder. Will make again.

Loved it! The family loved it. I didn't have 12 hours to marinate, but 5 hours seem to be enough.  I used in on all other parts of the chicken, and they all turned out excellent.

These turned out really good, my picky sister even liked them. I didn't have any corn flour so I just added about 1/4 tsp of Chinese 5 spice to the ap flour, fried the wings and finished in the oven. Delicious
