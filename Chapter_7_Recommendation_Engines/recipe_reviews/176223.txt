Amazing beans!  Please don't let the reviews that say this is too spicy keep you from trying this great recipe...just adjust it to your own liking....you won't be sorry.  I am from NM, so I have chile running through my veins..lol.  I always have NM roasted green chile in my freezer...so I added about 4-5 chopped green chiles and the result was wonderful!  I do like jalapenos, but I prefer using green chiles...thanks for submitting this great and easy recipe!

Hot as Hell is right! Holy WOW! These have great flavor but I do recommend cutting back on the jalapeno peppers if you want to be able to taste that great flavor instead of tasting what a tongue engulfed in flames tastes like. Again, excellent flavor and we do like hot but I will scale down on the peppers a bit next time. Thanks for the great recipe Flyineggbeater!

I love this recipe!!! It's such a versatile side dish and can go with just about anything. I've seen a lot of people talk about how this dish is too hot and I have to disagree. PLEASE NOTE: Peppers are a subjective ingredient in ANY recipe and THE AMOUNT MUST BE ADJUSTED TO TASTE. If you DO NOT like a lot of heat, try substituting green chiles with 1-2 chopped and seeded jalapenos. Also note that THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF JARRED JALAPENOS. Try finding ones labeled as mild, pickled, or seeded to reduce the heat. To me and my family, jalapenos are more tangy than hot and we usually add in some additional chipotles with adobo.

Great, great recipe.  I did not soak ours overnight.  I put the dried (washed) beans in my pressure cooker with 4 cups of water and cooked on high for 30 minutes.  Perfect texture.  Next I added in 1 can RoTel diced tomatoes with habaneros (hot) undrained, 1tsp salt, 1tsp black pepper and 1/2 cup BBQ sauce.  The onion powder, garlic powder and liquid smoke as written.  Boy, these babies are HOT!

I replaced the jalapenos, tomatoes, onion and garlic with *fresh* ingredients instead of cans/powders.    OH MY! These are awesome! They were definitely warm, but not too hot (for us!).  We served them with our pulled pork sandwiches - matching barbecue sauces.  What a GREAT recipe!!  Thank you!!

Made as stated except that I added 7 oz green chilis and only 2 TB chopped jalapenos.  It still turned out pretty spicy but very tolerable.  The flavor was good but nothing to write home about.  We will eat these for the next few days (it makes a lot!) but I will likely not make them again.

These certainly live up to their name!  Too hot even for my husband who really likes hot food.  Won't make again.  Sorry.  I guess we're too gringo.

Hot as hell is and understatement!! But these beans have great flavor! I used a 4oz can of diced HOT jalapenos. Next time i will use mild or med. I cant believe the recipe calls for 7oz.!! This would be great served at a bbq. Will be making this again.

Extremely easy to make, delicious and spicy.  We love spicy food, so this was not too spicy for us.  The only change I made was to use smoked paprika instead of liquid smoke. A great side dish or a meal in itself with some homemade cornbread!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Love, love these beans! I make them weekly for lunches at work. I've added a little of whatever kind of meat I have on hand....smoked sausage, pulled pork, ham, or even turkey bacon. Fabulous and easy!

I loved the sound of this recipe, and couldn't wait to try it.  I did balk at the idea of an entire 7 oz. can of jalapenos, though, and used someone else's idea of chipotle chilis in adobo, and in a lesser amount. I changed a few things,such as using Ro-Tel, rather than plain tomatoes, and used fresh onions.  We loved the beans, and the "bite".

instead of the can of jalepenos and the liquid smoke have  you tried chilis in adobo. Ibelieve this will give the hot but the adobo a bit of a smoother taste. Walmart usually stocks this item

A great approach to cooking beans and adding flavor at the same time. Used a whole sliced fresh jalapeno and made in the slow cooker.

Excellent beans.  They certainly do have pizzazz.  Next time, though, I intend to cook them a few hours to get tender before I add the tomatoes, as we Southerners like our beans "mushy."  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
