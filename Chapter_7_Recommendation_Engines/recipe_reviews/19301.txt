YUM!  This taste like lasagna.  I did make it a couple times.  The first time I followed the recipe.  It was a little bland to me.  The next time I browned the meat and used minced garlic, onion powder (or minced onions), pepper and salt.  I didn't put in the green onions because we don't like them.  I also put more cheese too.  I really liked the cream cheese in this recipe.  I didn't think it sounded very good.  Just give it a try and you may like it like I did! My 6 and 9 year old liked it too.

This is a good foundational recipe IF you DECREASE the amount of green onions and ADD one can of Cream of Mushroom soup.  Mix the CR soup with the cream cheese, sour cream, and green onions. This adds so much more flavor. After these modifications, this dish was HEAVENLY.  My family LOVED it!!!

I liked this a lot. I think the meat need more seasoning. I used seasoning salt. I also added a tad of milk to the cream mixture and used neufchatel instead of cream cheese.

Another note about this one - I mixed a small container of cottage cheese, the cream cheese it calls for, the sour cream it calls for and added both parmesan cheese and mozarella cheese.  I also added 1 can (15oz) crushed tomatoes to the meat mixture.  I also mixed EVERYTHING together (the meat mix when it's fully cooked, the cheese combo and the noodles) - I think it "melds" the flavors better - two picky kids (7 and 10) in our house LOVED this... Next I'm going to experiment on ways to cut down on the fat.  Awesome recipe!

We really liked this. I blended the cream cheese mixture into the tomato mixture like someone suggested. I also left the green onions out because of my husband and 2 year old. I then just sprinkled them fresh on top of my bowl. It was yummy!

This recipe is easy and tasty but it lacks something.  I followed the recipe but omitted the green onion due to preference but sustituted with onion powder in the meat/sauce mix.  As I was adding the first layer of the cheese mix on top of the noodles I decided it would be much easier to mix the cheese and meat/sauce all together to spread on top of the noodle layers. Because it's easy and tasty I will make again and play around with some seasonings to make it a 5-star in my book.

This was kind of like hamburger helper but much better and definitely healthier since there are no preservatives!  I will definitely make this again.  My husband thought it could use a bit more sauce so I might increase that a bit next time.

This got raves from my husband. I used a large can of tomato soup instead of tomato sauce and didn't have sour cream so I used another oz of cream cheese and used dried chives instead of fresh green onion. Shredded American cheese on top. I divided the noodles into a bottom layer and top layer and dumped all the sauce in the middle and dabbed the cream cheese mix on as it wouldn't spread.  We had seconds because this was so good! Thanks Katherine.

This was very budget friendly and delicious. A perfect way to use up some leftover pesto cream cheese dip and a small amount of sour cream. I wasn't able to spread the layers so I just mixed them up and then topped with the shredded cheese. Light sour cream and ground turkey made this a teeny bit healthier. Turned out great. Yummy comfort food.

Delicious!!  I shredded some leftover pork, added 3 tbs of spicy spaghetti seasoning, more salt, and mixed everything together before putting it in the casserole dish.  What a great flavor!!  Best of all-- super easy to prepare.

It wasn't bad but honestly it wasn't that good either. I mean it didn't have much of a taste and for all the things in it I would expect more.

Economical, easy recipe to prepare. The green onion was overpowering in this recipe. Perhaps substitute sauteed onions instead. Leftovers lasted a whole week, unfortunately. Will work on customizing to our own taste. Thank you Katherine!

If you like mild dishes, then this is for you.  This is good as written, but definitely needs something to kick it up a bit for the personal preferences of my family. I will make this again, but will add some additional seasonings.

I added regular chopped onion to the beef instead of the green onions. Also, put in lots of pepper and seasoning salt. Mix in the tomato sauce, sour cream and cream cheese and a small amount of milk. Add some canned corn kernels and about 1/4 cup of parmesan. Mix everything together (noodles and sauce), top with cheese and bake. Wonderful.

I made this a couple times when I first moved out on my own. My friends and I called it "Church Lady Casserole" because I think I'd gotten it from one of the elderly ladies from my church congregation. This doubles well. Even better with Trashy Garlic Bread.

really good. i used the suggestions to mix the noodles with the cream cheese mixture. could use a little more seasoning. My family loved it. Update, My family was not as excited about this following the recipe exactly, my daughter didn't really like it, so I downgraded to 4 stars. The ease of making and the short amount of time it takes to make gives this recipe a place in my file.

VERY GOOD. I DID USE A CAN OF CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP AS OTHERS HAD MENTIONED AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT. I ALSO MIXED EVERY THING TOGETHER RATHER THAN LAYERING IT.

My boyfriend absolutely loved this recipe.  I used light cream cheese, 95% lean ground beef, and fat free sour cream to cut down the calories and make it a healthier dish.  I also put a little more sauce because I was afraid that the cheese and sour cream would be too overwhelming.  I would definitely make this again.

I added a can of cream of mushroom soup like one of the other reviewers mentioned. I also mixed everything together before baking it because we like it better that way than when it is in layers.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe but I used 1/2 pork sausage, 1/2 ground beef for the meat.  This would be a great recipes for a family with kids.

Awesome!! I added cream of mushroom soup like some others have suggested. The green onions were the key to adding flavor. Our son loved it!

I didnt have cream cheese, but I used some mixed parmesan and romano. I also used 1/3 jar spaghetti sauce since I didnt have tomato sauce.This recipe is great b/c you can really work with it and it is very forgiving. Sooo Yummy.

Very good lasagna-like flavor. I did, however, have some trouble spreading the cheese mixture & sauce though. I'll probrably try mixing it all together next time. Very good taste though.

We loved this one!  It's hard to layer the cream cheese sauce so we mixed it in with the meat.  Green onions are a great touch.

I have a similar recipe to this but you use Chinese noodles ( they look like short  spaghetti ) in a pinch you could use angel hair pasta, vermicelli.  but the Chinese noodles are better.  I use 2 lbs ground beef 2 cans tomato sauce. 2 cups cheese.   You make it the night before and let it sit overnight.  It's my favorite casserole.

I have made this as is and husband and I both liked it as is.  The next time I made it, I added some garlic and onion powder to the meat and I think it adds a little bit to the flavor.  This is a keeper!

I found this very hard to layer because there didn't seem to be enough of the cream cheese/sour cream mixture to spread over the whole thing. I even added in more sour cream than the recipe called for but just didn't want to spread.   It tasted very good so if I make it again, will probably do as someone else suggested and just mix everything together, then top with the cheese.

This really does taste like lasagna and I love it! I didn't have meat on hand but it still turned out very well. Next time I will use the beef though to see how much more filling it would be. My kids tried it and liked it and I will certainly make this one again. Thanks!

I am rating this on my family's views, I made it but did not actually eat any. It looked good, and instead of the plain tomato sauce I had a can of Chef Boyardee pizza sauce in the cupboard that I used. My son ate all of his so it must be good, he is a VERY picky eater.

I made this for the kids.  They seemed to like it.  Said it tasted like Hamburger Helper!  It does. ..  but better of course.  It was very easy to make too!  I think maybe I liked it more than they did, they didn't clean their plate like they usually do.

Awesome for kids!  Like a homeade (and much tastier) version of hamburger helper...couldn't spread the cream cheese/sour cream mixture so I just blended it into the tomato sauce.  I used Italian style meatloaf mix (beef,pork & veal) instead of plain ground beef & added green bell pepper to the meat mix.

I thought this tasted a lot like Hamburger Helper. Not bad, but not knock-your-socks-off. I sauteed some yellow onion with the beef, and left out the green onion.

I have to agree with other reviewers that 6 onions is a little too much.  I cut it down to 3.  An okay recipe.  Would probably not make again.  Thanks for letting me try.

Good flavor. The cream cheese does not really melt, so the kids did not care for that part. My husband and I enjoyed it. I will try it at a potluck.
