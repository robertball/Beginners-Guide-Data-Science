So good!  Great flavor, easy and delicious! I marinated the chicken for about an hour in the pesto before baking so the flavor could really sink in! Will definitly be making this again!

Try buying thick breasts and lightly poking them all over with a fork to help the marinade really seep into the chicken.  Cut a pocket into each breast and stuff it with motz cheese, closing it with a toothpick.  Marinate the chicken for at least an hour, then bake according to the directions.  After adding the tomato feel free to add a light sprinkling of cheese for presentation.  The only way I can get the males in my family to eat chicken breast (deemed to be "boring" and "too healthy") is to stuff it with cheese.

The only thing hubby and I liked about this was that the chicken was cooked perfectly--tender and juicy. Ideally the various flavors in a dish should all marry well and blend together for a finished product that has its own taste and no one flavor is dominant.  While I had high hopes and expectations for this, I was really off the mark on this one.  The chicken, while tender and juicy, was just flavorless chicken coated with a pronounced flavor of (homemade) pesto which didn't permeate into the chicken at all. This, then, topped with raw tomato barely heated under the melted, near flavorless mozarella, made for a very disappointing meal.

I cooked this for my family yesterday and they LOVED it!  This recipe was quick to prepare, did not have too many ingredients, is completely affordable and tastes great! It has just the right amount of spice, and the chicken comes out of the oven so tender you can cut it with a fork.  I could not find frozen pesto sauce though, so I used the pesto you find in the spaghetti isle at the store... it was delish! It will be a new "regular" in our family meals.

So easy I can't even believe it...I used my own fav pesto.  Didn't have mozzarella, so I sprinkled with feta cheese.  AWESOME.  Next time I think I'll add some chopped sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh.  Anything this easy and tasty gets 5 stars from me, thanks for the idea!

A group of men and I served this meal to a group of women to honor them and the women thought it was absolutely phenomenal! We put the pesto sauce in a gallon sized bag, got the chicken covered then when we were done, we put the remaining pesto over the chicken. The women loved it!

Was surpised to see that by the time I finished dishing out the dinners- my daughter had gobbled her chicken down. No tomatoes for my son however. The left over chicken was made into chicken salad sandwich and hubby gobbled that down too-Will make again

Excellent and easy.  We have the flash frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts which can be baked from frozen, so I spread pesto over the frozen breasts and cooked.  Cook times worked even with the frozen, and it turned out flavorful and delicious.  We both loved it; this is a great meal to turn to on weeknights!  Thanks so much.

This dish is rather dry and plain which I wouldn't have thought with using pesto. It tasted much better after marinating it in the pesto for a couple of hours. The cheese goes unnoticeable. I'll try using a stronger cheese next time.

I don't think I even made this right and it was SO easy and SO good.  I had a lot of chicken so I used the entire package of pesto.  I marinated it in a baking dish for about 30 min before baking it (I also lowered the heat a little because I used thinly sliced chicken).  I cooked the chicken right in the baking dish (instead of a baking sheet) and it was amazingly tender, tasty, with a nice sauce.  My husband - who is pickier than a 3 year old when it comes to food! - took one bite and said, "This chicken is really good!'  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

This is one of the best chicken recipes on this site! We LOVED it!!! I used a good quality store bought pesto and it turned out FABULOUS! I didn't have any mozzarella on hand, so I substituted swiss cheese instead... as I've already said, "FABULOUS"!!! This tastes like it's complex to make, but it's OH SO EASY! Trust me on this one; this will "WOW" your dinner guests. I just had some leftover for lunch and it's just as good the 2nd day! THANK YOU so much for submitting this one!!!

This recipe gets five stars for ease and simplicity, and 4.5 for taste.  Next time I think I'll do as others suggested and let the chicken "marinade" in the pesto for a while before it goes in the oven.  We skipped the tomatoes for personal preference and served the chicken with spaghetti with olive oil and parmesean and a salad.

I made this with my homemade pesto and used provolone cheese.  I marinated the chicken in the pesto for 1 hour then baked the chicken for about 25 minutes. Then I added the tomatoes with a light sprinkle of salt.  Baked for 5 more minutes, then placed the provolone on top and baked another 5 minutes (35 minutes total baking time).  The chicken was super moist and tender with lots of flavor.  This recipe looks impressive, tastes even better, and would be great to serve to guests!

What a quick, simple, delicious recipe that has an impressive presentation. It is a great dish that looks as if you've been cooking all day! I even prepared it for my husband's men's group of 16. I baked it in casserole dishes and served it with pesto fussili and salad as side dishes. I had to increase the baking time by about 20 minutes, but used a thermometer so they would not be overcooked. It was quite the succcess. I got rave reviews when I returned home! They LOVED it!

Very good.  I added a little more olive oil and garlic.  I poked holes in the chicken and let it marinade in the fridge for about 5 hours.  I then cooked it as directed but I finished it off with pepper jack instead of mozzarella.  I served it with pasta and caesar salad.  My whole family loved it.

Good recipe! You can pretty much use any brand of refrigerated pesto. I used the one from Trader Joe's. Loved it!

So easy! Hubby really loved this. I liked a lot but found the pesto flavor very overwhelming. I love pesto but I guess in smaller amounts. I will make with provolone cheese next time!

I make this every week and my family looooves it!!! I usually put the pesto sauce in a bag with 3 or 4 chicken breasts, moosh it around so the breasts are covered and leave it marinate in the fridge for an hour. I then bake and top with the cheese and tomatoes the last 5 minutes. Tastes like something you would get in a nice restaurant.

This was a great last minute throw together meal. I used homemade pesto (a lot more than 1/2 C because I wanted extra sauce for the noodles) and used sundried tomatoes, added a little parmesan. I also poked the chicken since I didn't have time to marinate. Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious dinner!  We didn't have mozz cheese so substituted feta and goat cheese - yum!  Very simple and quick.  Will be keeping this recipe close by when a quick meal is needed.

So easy and yet so very good! My husband said this chicken was delicious and wants to add this to our more frequent meals. Thank you for sharing!! We ate this with a salad and a side of rice. Thinking some hot, toasty garlic bread would be perfect with it next time.

This is such a great and easy recipe. I made a couple of changes. I did marinate the chicken in the pesto for an hour in a plastic bag in the fridge (with store bought pesto). Then I made pesto (out of the packets you buy at the grocery store) and poured over the chicken in a baking dish. I then baked it covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered an additional 35 minutes, adding only mozzarella during the last 7 minutes of cooking (we are not big fans of tomato). It was so tasty and tender. I will definitely be making this again.

Definitely a five star chicken recipe.  The only change I made was to use sundried tomatoes in place of reg.  My cooking times was 20 minutes total.

This is good, but I would suggest marinating the chicken for a few hours before baking.  Also, we like using feta cheese instead.  Much more flavorful that way.

After reading many of the other reviews, i made some changes in this dish and ended up with a fantastic chicken dish. I decided to pound the chicken to about 1/2 inch and marinate overnight in the pesto (i used a store bought jar pesto). Before baking, i spread about a tablespoon of sundried tomato paste on each breast and sprinkled about the same amount of crumbled feta cheese. I rolled each breast and secured with toothpicks. I still topped each one with the tomato and mozzarella as directed. Baking time was a little longer using this method but the end result was absolutely delish!

I did not use the tomatoes and since I did not have mozzarella at the house I used what I had (cheese mix) and added some parm. It turned out great.

Everyone liked it - even the kids. I omitted the tomatoes and cheese (probably would have added both had it just been for the adults). I marinated the chicken breasts in the pesto for about 30 minutes, then baked for 25 min - very tender and great flavor!

OMG!! So, good! I am in love with the Benno's Birdy at a famous deli in Ann Arbor, MI. It is muy delicioso! We followed the recipe, but oven-roasted the tomatoes, forked the chicken and marinated it for about 45 minutes before baking, uncovered, for about thirty minutes at 400. Served with a tasty baguette. Yumm-o!!

We love the flavor of basil pesto.  This was a hit.  I used our own pesto that I had made and frozen in ice cube trays. And coated both sides of the chicken with it.  I did not have any tomatoes so did without.  Next time will dice up some tomatoes and put them on to warm slightly in the oven. The chicken came out moist and flavorful. It was delicious.  If you don't like a lot of pesto then just coat one side of the chicken with pesto.

I've been making this dish for quite some time.  The only step I do is to pound the plain chicken thin.  Then I apply a generous amount of pesto.  I sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and roll up.  I place all the chicken rolls in a pan greased with olive oil and brush a bit of olive oil on the tops of the chicken.  I also sprinkle some mozzerella on the tops of each roll.  If I feel like making a nice presentation, I will precut each roll into 4 or 5 pieces before plating it.

This is such a good way to spice up leftover or bland chicken! I showed my sister, who is a bit challenged in the kitchen, this recipe and she has made it numerous times for her family. This is an easy, delicious recipe that everyone always enjoys.

This was absolutely fabulous! I have made it twice. First, I used the mozzarella and the Pesto Sauce recipe from this site. Very nice. The next time, I used some tomato-basil gouda that I had in the fridge. This was TO DIE FOR. Make it!

this was really very good.  I used some homemade pesto since this time of year it is very easy to buy very fresh basil at the local farm stand and make your own.  I will next time boil some pasta to collect the delicious sauce the chicken makes and use with additional pesto.   Already thinking about making this again next week once I can go to the farmstand over the weekend!  Highly recommend.

Love it!!  Great recipe as-is.  I used a random jar of pesto I had in the pantry, threw the chicken & pesto into a freezer bag, shook it up, and let it sit for about 20 minutes before baking. I cooked the chicken for 30 minutes, then for 3 more minutes after adding the cheese and tomato.  It was perfect!  My friend said she felt like she was eating Carrabbas in my livingroom.

pretty darned good. pounded chix tenders flat (it's almost impossible to find breasts that small) , so it didn't take that long to cook. might have been interesting with provolone instead of mozzarella. maybe next time.

I marinated my chicken in the pesto for about 4-5 hours.  I then topped it with some chopped oven roasted tomatoes instead of fresh and a small amount of grated mozzarella.  Excellent - and makes a great sandwich the next day too.  Thanks!

A bit dry and chewy.  Maybe our chicken was thin and should have been cooked less, but not the best.

This chicken was perfect!  I used 5 tenderloins, thawed out and then I punctured a few holes in each (front and back) and then marinaded them in the pesto basil sauce for 2 hours.  I used Classico Oringinal Pesto and Basil Sauce.  It was so delicious.  I couldn't believe it!  It wasn't overpowering with the 'herby' flavor and it was a hit with the family.  I served it with broccoli and Amish Potato Salad (the custom recipe on my page)  Thanks so much for sharing!!

My husband rarely comments on a meal but said, " if you want input, this was pretty good" so you know it was really good. I did as others suggested and put the pesto on the chicken(I used frozen,boneless, skinless tenderloins so I put the pesto on and let them sit for about 3 hrs. Then followed recipe. Simple and easy meal with great flavor. Will be making this often.

Excellent! Made 2 servings. Had 3 greek olives to get rid of so chopped and put on top of the tomatoes before adding the cheese. My husband also loved this dish. Will prepare often!

ok, so I actually did this for tilapia and it was amazing! and I don't think you have to use Buitoni pesto either...homeade pesto is great or another brand as well. I added garlic pepper too!

Easy weeknight dinner and quite tasty!  I did take other reviewers advice and marinate the chicken for an hour in the pesto.  Then baked and added a 4 cheese blend at the end rather than mozzarella.  I only put tomatoes on my chicken but didn't think they added much to the dish.

This is a great idea for a meal but I can't give it 5 stars as it is.  It needs Feta cheese and sun dried tomatoes to replace what is called for in the recipe.    This is a basic "throw together because you have nothing else in the fridge" meal.  It could be 5 starts with a little work.

Easy enough to make. This recipe yields a LOT of pesto. If you really like pesto, then you'll love this recipe. Otherwise, you could probably use 1/2 the amount of pesto and still have a great meal.

Wow!  I marinated this for 24 hours in the pesto.  Then I used JACKROX suggestions and used sun dried tomatoes and feta instead.  My kids ate this like it was going out of style and it was easy and delicious.  A definate keeper!

I made this recipe last night w/chicken thighs and it was wonderful. I used a pesto packet and followed the directions without cooking the sauce. poured it over the chicken to marinate 30 mins. I also baked it in a glass pan, at 350 degrees. I made alfredo sauce on the side from a packet I had and added a little juice from the basil sauce and mixed it with linguine. Will make again definitely.

I loved this recipe.  Possibly the best chicken dish I have ever made.  I always buy a pesto sauce that is in a jar in the canned food section of the grocery.  I did take another reviewer advice (which I think made this recipe seem more complex (but easy) and even more delicious) and stuffed the chicken breast with mozz cheese.  I sealed it up with a couple toothpicks while baking.  Remove them before serving.  The tomatoes and cheese on top are a must.  The olive oil for the pesto keeps the chicken sooo juicy!  YUM!!!

yum! I just sprinkled with a pesto mix packet, baked for 40 minutes at 350, then added fresh homegrown tomatoes and mozzerella cheese and baked for 10-15 more minutes - served with whole wheat pasta! so easy!

The chicken was moist and somewhat flavorful, but I was not blown away by this recipe. I poked holes in my chicken breasts and put them into zip lock bags with pesto sauce. I let them marinate in the pesto for 3 hours in the refrigerator. I cooked them in a pan with a small amount of water on the bottom for 40 minutes then topped them with tomato and swiss because that's what I had on hand. I don't know what I could have done differently to get my chicken to "soak up" the pesto flavor a little more. I probably won't make this again.

Product description is right on- super easy and delicous- espeically with fresh tomatoes from the garden. I used reduced fat mozzerala and it was good, but think it would be great with other cheeses as well (ie Sargento artisian blends.

Wonderful recipe!!  Marinated in a homemade pesto made with almonds for about an hour.  Followed the recipe except for the tomatoes.  I only had cherry tomatoes so I made a warm relish with them and added them as per the recipe.  Exteremely quick and tasty recipe.  This will become a main staple in our house.

I wanted to love this recipe... sounded so easy and wonderful.  The chicken did turn out very moist, but just too bland for my family.  I even marinated it for 2 hours in some pesto, plus a little garlic and basil. Sliced leftovers did make a nice sandwich the next day.

We thought this was really tasty with a slight change I made.  I frequently use a texturized meat mallet to pound boneless, skinless breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap before cooking which not only tenderizes them but also enables them to better absorb any marinade or other flavors from a particular recipe.  It definitely makes this dish turn out better.  I laid the pounded breasts (with the more "open" side up) in a baking dish coated with cooking spray, covered them with the wonderful refrigerated fresh pesto from Sam's Club and let them sit for a bit before baking.  Also, instead of mozzarella, I used a fresh 4 cheese blend of grated Provolone, Asiago, Parm and Romano.  Delicious!  Will definitely be making this again.  I had one extra chicken breast which made for a yummy leftover the next day.

Very good and moist.  I cut up the breast halves (about 6-7 pieces per half) and marinated them for an hour or two in the pesto before I cooked them.  I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of canned or fresh.  Yummy and pretty easy.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I sprinkled garlic powder over the chicken, pesto sauce and marinated for 30 mins. I did use the tomatoes, glad I did.  The chicken was so moist and the flavors melded into the chicken.  Will definitely make again.

This was easy to make, but I thought it was rather dry and flavorless. I made two of the breasts without tomatoes for my kids. I used sundried tomatoes on mine and regular tomatoes on the other. It didn't matter -- they were all rather bland. If I were to try again, I would use a more flavorful cheese than mozzarella, or maybe try breading the breasts,  but with soooo many other chicken recipes out there, I probably won't try again.

What happened?!  I did not like this and I like pesto and chicken so I thought together would be great.  The chicken seemed tuff and not very flavorable.  I did make my own pesto sauce, but that shouldnt have been the problem since it tasted great seperate from the chicken.  I marinated it for an hour too.  Maybe the chicken I used just want that great?

I loved this recipe!  I marinated the chicken in the pesto for about 40 mintes.  I put two to three thin slices of tomato and then topped with cheese. It was delicious!  Thank you for the recipe...this is a keeper!

This was ok, but not great.  I used the recipe exactly and it was just a little bland for my liking.  I think I will use more garlic and other flavors and just add some pesto at the end next time.  Thanks for the recipe, I do have to say it was the most tender baked chicken I have cooked in a long time!

Thanks!

I saw this in "Recipe of the Day" and it looked good, so I tried it last night. Followed the recipe, and thought it was very good. I pounded the chicken breasts out a little before adding the pesto. After baking for 20 minutes, I drained the oil from the pesto that the chicken was swimming in. I added the sliced tomatoes, and added Mozz, Cheddar, and Parm....came out nice. Thanks for the easy recipe!!

Delicious and easy to make.  I poked holes in the chicken with a fork and then allowed it to marinate in the pesto a few hours.  Added more pesto to the top of the chicken immediately before baking and baked covered about 20 minutes.  I used a 3 cheese Itallian blend and put fresh basil under the tomatoes and more cheese on top of the tomatoes, then baked 5 more minutes.  This recipe is boyfriend approved :)

Very good recipe. I followed a lot of the other reviews and marinated the chicken for about 45 minutes. Other than that I followed the recipe step by step. The chicken was very juicy and the pesto adds just the right amount of flavor. I would recommend this easy to make recipe for everyone.

Flavor wise this was more of a 3 1/2 but I gave it 4 stars since I had to substitue regular pesto for the pesto with sundried tomatoes (my local Safeway was out of the regular pesto since it was on sale this week...grrr ) I found the thick part of the chicken breasts to be a little bland but maybe the pesto with sundried tomatoes doesn't have as much flavor as the regular.

 I would definitely try this again but next time I'll marinate the chicken overnight in Italian dressing. I did marinated it for about an hour in the pesto after seeing some of the reviews but it didn't seem to help flavor the chicken. Loved how quick and easy this was to make though.

I fixed this for non-pesto lovers and they loved it.  Next time I am going to marinate the chicken longer, but it turned out amazing as is!

Delicious! I used homemade pesto, and a spoonful of canned petite diced tomatoes on each piece of chicken, because I didn't have any fresh.  Like the other reviewers, I marinated the chicken for a while.  I think it would have been even better if it marinated longer - next time, I'll try an hour.  I'll be making this for guests - it's so easy, and makes a nice presentation.

I made this tonight and it was great.  I did used the Pesto in the jar that is normally with the Spaghetti Sauce. I marinated the chicken breast for about 1 hour.  It had great flavor and the chicken was perfect.  We will be having this dinner again soon.

Very tasty.  The whole family loved it.  Quick meal for the family or guests.  I just added a  little sea salt on top of the mozzerella and it was great. I used tenderloins instead of chicken breasts.  It came out tender and moist.

One of the easiest and tastiest, not to mention healthy chicken recipes I've tried.  So simple, yet so good! I used my own homemade pesto which I think makes a world of difference.  I also added a little bit of salt and pepper to the chicken and used a mixture of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses.

This was great!  Next time I make it, I will either use thinner pieces of chicken or bake them in the oven for a full 25 minutes (which is, of course, what the recipe says to do, so that's my fault).  Delicious!

This chicken is very tasty!!  I marinate it the night before and it has a really good flavor.  I used a combination of parmesan and romano cheese.  Very, very tasty and moist.  My company loved it!!  Will definitely be making this again (tonight actually). :)

What a great recipe--easy and delicious! I used a pesto mix I had on hand (2 tsp dried pesto mix in 1/2 stick melted butter) and didn't have tomatoes on hand, but it was quick and turned out very well. The chicken was very tender; my husband (who's quite the chef himself) said it was the best-cooked chicken breasts he's ever had!

Very nice flavor and super easy to make. Could easily pass as a fancy meal. I like the chicken pounded super thin or I purchase chicken cutlets.

Wow!  I was shocked at how good this tasted.  Mine marinated in the pesto for quite some time.  I was going to marinate it all day, but forgot we had dinner plans already.  The next day I threw it in the freezer.  A week later I defrosted it in cold water (they were in the ziploc bag) and cooked them per instructions.  I used feta cheese instead and put it on half way through cooking time.  My husband was also shocked at how good it tasted.  The chicken was very tender and moist.  YUM!

Very easy, The chicken was very moist and flavorful, I poked the chicken with a fork so the pesto could marinate into the chicken. Great meal.

This was great. I marinated this in some leftover pesto and olive oil and stuffed it with shredded mozzarella. I skipped the tomatoes, because I don't really like heated tomatoes, but served with a nice green salad w fresh tomatoes. So easy and yummy. I think I'll make it tonight.

Very easy, very good.  Just make sure you pound the chicken first.  It really makes a difference in the tenderness.

Delicious! My hubby doesn't like tomatoes so I put roasted red peppers in their place and it was delicious! I also threw a little olive oil on the chicken breasts, this helped keep them moist. This will become a regular on our rotation!

I've cooked penne pasta with pesto sauce for a few years now. We've added chicken and mushrooms, but we've never had just pesto and the chicken. This was really good! We had to make some changes only b/c we were forced to. We went to the meat counter and asked for 2 full breasts and we got 2 good ol' Iowa chicken breasts... they're huge! They were 16 oz each (8 oz per 1/2 breast for 4 pieces total); almost twice the size called for in this recipe. I didn't use the refrigerated pesto b/c I couldn't find it so I opted to use the sauce I normally make for the meal I usually make mentioned above. It made one cup of pesto sauce and it was a perfect amount, even for the amount of chicken I used! I omitted the tomato b/c DH doesn't like them, and I didn't think I would w/ this dish, either. The cook time should be right on, since I had twice amount of chicken called for it took exactly twice as long. I didn't use motz cheese, instead I used feta (the full 4 oz package) and it was FANTASTIC!! Also, the recipe doesn't call for doing anything w/ the pesto sauce after coating the chicken in the bowl so I added it in the baking pan w/ the chicken and all. The juices from the chicken mixed w/ the extra pesto sauce was awesome; next time I will cook some noodles to have on the side w/ the extra sauce. We had a Romaine leaf salad and some texas toast garlic bread! This was a great meal, thanks!!

This was just okay.  I was hoping it would be great, since it's so easy, but it was really rather bland.  Nothing wrong with it, but I probably won't make again.

I love this recipe! This is my go to dinner when I want to make something quick and easy, but delicious. However, I have found that using feta cheese gives it more flavor. I slice down the middle of the breasts, stuff with feta, bake it, then put the tomatoes on and bake for the last 5 min. I normally serve over pasta, but it's also really good if you cut the chicken up and put on a salad.

This was quite tasty and easy! I first sprinkled the chicken in salt, pepper, and garlic powder and sauteed them a bit then topped with the pesto, tomato, and cheese and baked in the oven. Served over noodles (with butter and parmesan) and a small salad on the side. I'd make it again but it wasn't phenomenal. A good weeknight meal.

This was good.  Not wonderful, but easy enough.  I marinated for a couple hours and used canned diced tomatoes w/the mozz at the end.  I had to cook mine closer to 35-40 minutes but they were fairly thick breasts.  Thank you!

This is a great, quick and easy, recipe!  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden and provolone cheese (didn't have any mozarella) and it was delicious.  Next time I will try it with the mozarella, though I can't imagine it being any better!!

This was good, the preparation was quick and easy but it wasn't crazy good ... I will probably try to find a creamier pesto so that it stays juicy

This was SOOOO good!!!!  One of the reviewers added Panko bread crumbs after dipping the chicken in the pesto and it sounded so good I had to try that, and it was awesome!!!  I served it with rice and fresh pineapple which went together great!

I enjoyed it a lot! i used thin slices of chicken breast i believe that helps w/ all the reviews saying it was to "dry". i didnt marinate it though just stuck it in right after putting the pesto on it :)

Easy, tasty, and impressive.  Boyfriend approved, despite being slightly overcooked! (Something I wasn't sure was possible, given his refined tastes and my lack of skill in the kitchen.)    I agree with other reviewers - definitely marinate the chicken in the fridge for a while (in a large ziploc bag is easiest).  I added fresh grated parmesan with the mozerella cheese - it definitely spiced up the flavor a bit.  And the oil left over in the pan from baking combined well with balsamic vinegar to make an easy, complimentary salad dressing!

Didn't have enough chicken breasts on hand, so included two fileted thighs. Marinated the meat for four hours, and otherwise followed the recipe. I ate one of the breasts, while my wife, who prefers dark meat (as so I) ate a thigh. She commented that it was some of the best chicken she had ever eaten. Surprised and pleased, I gave it a five. I didn't feel so strongly, but it was very good, served with baked acorn squash and a tossed salad.

Very good!  I thought the chicken might get dried out since it was baked uncovered, but it did not.  I cut the breasts into 3 even pieces and they were done in 20 minutes. There was some pesto left in the bowl, so I peeled some garlic cloves and tossed them until they were coated and baked them whole with the chicken - yum! The chicken was great sliced in a hot sandwich the next day!

SO EASY, which is a MUST for me.  My husband loved it too, and he needs a lot of flavor.  I used Classico Traditional Pesto and served it on bulky rolls. Deelish!

I'm so glad to have tried this recipe - it was fantastic!! Super easy and just SO tasty! The only difference for me was that I made my own pesto since I happen to have a whole lot of basil that i needed to do something with so this was perfect and even with making my own pesto(which only took 5 min.) it was still so easy and quick. My 2 year old. couldn't get enough of it and even my picky 5 yr. old ate it and had to admit it was really good.  I didn't have time to let it marinade but definetly will next time but can't imagine it being any tastier :)  thks for the great recipe! It came it very handy on a weekday night when I just couldn't think what to make for dinner!

This was pretty good.  I rubbed my chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic and then tossed it in a plastic bag and marinated it over night.  I made it according to the directions the next day and it was so juicy!  I sprinkled a little bit of crushed red pepper on top to give it some ooomph and my hubby loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Was a wonderful and easy recipe.  I ended up marinating the chicken for about an hour and half in the pesto while I worked on a few other things.  Turned out great!  Especially easy -- I'd never cooked chicken before.  Was a great first time recipe.

Excellent!  My husband could NOT stop raving about this!  We pounded the chicken breast thin (about !/2") before cooking.  I also adding a little shredded parmesean cheese to the mozzarella. Delish!

I marinated the chicken in the pesto sauce all day and then cooked the chicken when I got home from work.  I thought it  was okay and easy to assemble, though I doubt I'll make it again.

The taste was good.  The chicken was incredibly moist!  Family liked it.  I am only giving 4 stars because visually it is unappealing.  It was green chicken.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe. The only things I did different were: using pesto basil from the spaghetti isle; added the tomato at the start of baking; and basted the chicken with the pesto mixture every 10 minutes. Was juicy and delicious!

I found this recipe very easy and pretty darn good but using the leftovers was the best.  For lunch the next day I sliced the chicken and reheated for sandwiches on a crusty roll adding a bit more pesto and cheese.  They were exellent.  I also used large breasts and pounded them flat.

This recipe was very easy.  I made homemade pesto instead of using the ready made, it didn't take much additional time.

This was super easy and very tasty.  I knew it would be good when I could smell it baking in the oven.  I used more pesto than recomended.  I also served the chicken atop a cappellini mixed with pesto.  I used canned plum tomatoes which mixed in perfectly with the pasta.

This was pretty good.  It would have been alot better if I didn't dry out my chicken, I left it in to long, and my pesto sauce was store brand, should've spent the extra dollar on the name brand. We still ate all of it though!

This is a winner!  The whole family loved it!  I didn't have time to marinate the chicken like some other reviewers mentioned doing, but it still had an incredible pesto flavor and was very tender.

So easy, and so good. This will be a go-to recipe when I need something that's quick to put together. I did marinate the chicken in the pesto for a few hours, and it was really tender and flavorful.

This recipe was actually quite good for an everyday meal & didn't require too many ingredients.  It was very easy to put together.  The tomatoes really brought the flavors together for me.  Just be sure not to overcook the chicken in such a hot oven!

I followed the recipe, however I seared the chicken breasts really quickly with salt and pepper first. Added the pesto all over both sides of the chicken, baked it and we really liked it. Alot of flavor. It didn't need the cheese and I served it with a tomato salad. Yum. Will make this again.

I didn't read the reviews and didn't marinade.  It needs it.  It could also use a stronger cheese flavour.  Overall, it was a wonderfully simple and pretty dinner.  I cooked it with my baby in the sling and it still tasted much better than what I have been doling out to my family lately.  Thanks!

this was very tasty, needs to marinate for 1+hrs. Use fresh pesto, makes a difference- used Butoni's fresh on chix, but Classico in a jar on pasta, was not as good.

Delicious!  I marinated (after the suggestions of others) for about an hour or so.  I added a sprinkle of parmesean on top of the cheese.
For a side dish I heated up a bag of mixed veggies, tossed it with some olive oil and some cooked penne pasta, garlic powder, and more parmesean cheese.  BOTH were outstanding and extremely EASY to do.

This was very good.  Next time, I will let the chicken breasts marinate in the pesto before cooking.  It was a quick, easy recipe for those busy nights! Thanks!

Quite delicious. Didn't expect the brand of Pesto I bought would cause such a mess for the oven. But overall, tasty. Definitely worth making again.
