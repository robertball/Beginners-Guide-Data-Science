This is my favorite kind of taco. In my area we use corn tortillas instead of flour and instead of topping with lettuce, guac, and pico we use cilantro, raw chopped onion, and green or red sauce. We also use the mini tortillas so we cut the beef into tiny cubes once it has rested. With that being said, my review is based on the actual recipe and not the suggested toppings. This works great and gets the meat nice and tender however I feel it needs more actual season. For the 2nd batch I left out the salt and added a couple packets of Sazon seasoning and they were delicious. Overall good recipe and one I would make again. Remember to not let your meat marinate too long. The lime "cooks" the meat and turns it mushy if you leave it in there too long.

Brilliant!  Utilized the ingredients to marinate a flank steak. We were seeking a greater Latin flavor especially with a lime component. Too many recipes opt for the vinegar as the main but this recipe well exceeded expectations.   No changes made; grilled to a fine medium rare. Kids even raved about the flavor.  Will save for a re-do in future.

My husband said it's the best I've made in a while-  and kids loved it too. I used a shaved beef, but the marinade was great! I added extra garlic and cilantro and topped with cilantro as well.
