A yummy blend of flavours. This was a great way to use some of the tomatillos I grew this year, and I know it will be a favourite.

Mom and I made this one year. Everybody who had some wanted more but were to shy to ask. Mom had two Jars and she is SUCH a neat freak she tossed them... When we all found out we were mad! I have tomatillos coming out of my ears this year. Just did my first batch of the Year. Its great mixed with salsa.

I had so much tomatoes and tomatillo this year, this was the perfect recipe to try. My family loved this, and I am making my second batch as  I type. The taste was less relishy than tomatoe relish. A sweet, tart relish.  had no currants and added a handful of dried cranberry, which gave it a gorgeous maroon colour.

We loved this! The only things I changed were how I thickened it, and the canning process. Instead of simmering for 1-2 hours, I put the burner on high and rapid boiled it for about 25 minutes, stirring constantly. And instead of using the hot water canning process, I put the chutney in 8 oz. jelly jars and pressure canned it at 6 pounds pressure for 10 minutes. I doubled the recipe and made 14 - 8 oz. jars of this delicious thick condiment. Today, a month later, I'm doing it all over again to use as gifts. Besides being a wonderful compliment on pork and chicken, try dumping 8 ounces of this in a batch of jasmine rice right before serving.
