Yes, this was an easy dinner.  However, it lacked in flavor.  I even added more garlic.  Not sure that we will eat this again.  But thank you for the quick meal.

Really was a good recipe. I had to use more slices of cheese because my kids love alot of cheese on their hamburger. I also tried it with velveeta which turned out even better.

Kids loved it. It tastes good, better than a normal burger. I omitted the onions (kids don't like to see it), added onion salt instead to get the flavor.

Very good.  I used some different seasonings in the meat and also cooked some chopped bacon to put on top (like a bacon cheeseburger)...yum.

It was a hit. I added cavenders and replaced 2 of the American cheese with hot  cheese. Yummy and fast.

These didn't have much flavor. Def needs some salt & pepper. Have regular burger condiments handy. These were ok but nothing I would make again.

This was very yummy and easy to make!  Looking at the recipe though we felt it needed a little extra something so made a quick 'salad' of shredded lettuce, chopped pickle and chopped tomato tossed lightly with mayo and served it on top.  It was AWESOME!  So quick, so easy and my family all agreed they would like it again!!

These were quick, yummy, and filling. I added a little ketchup and mustard to the meat mixture. Be sure to use garlic powder, I grabbed the garlic salt without thinking and it was a bit salty. Had to rinse my meat. I only did a pound of meat and used 3 slices of cheese.
