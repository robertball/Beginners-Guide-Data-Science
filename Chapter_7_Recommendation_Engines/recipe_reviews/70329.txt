The reason these don't taste like a traditional Jewish bakery is the butter: a Kosher baker would use oil so that the hamentashen will be pareve.  

I've made these and the oil recipes; both taste great to me.  However, for those of you needing a non-dairy hamentashen, go with the other hamentashen recipes.

While the cookie dough is indeed delicious, this is not like the bakery hamantashen here in the Northeast. It is basically a butter cookie with jam filling.  I used only 3/4 cup sugar in the recipe and it was still too sweet.  I also left out some of the butter and it was still too buttery!!  I will alter this recipe or find another one to fit my tastes better.  If you're used to a classic New York style hamantashen from a Jewish bakery, try a different recipe.

I made the dough the night before. My 10 year old rolled out the dough, used a glass to cut circles, filled with filling and pinched into triangles.

It is important to put them in the freezer for at least 5 minutes before cooking them.  The ones with cherry filling in my first batch came apart because I did not freeze them first.

It was easy to eat them all at once!

Oil is not the only thing you can use in place of butter or margarine to make the Hamantashen pareve (non-dairy).  I bake numerous pareve desserts weekly, ranging from cakes to cookies to bars & I always use Nucoa margarine in place of traditional dairy butter or margarine.  There are other brands of pareve margarine out there; I have found the Nucoa brand to be the best for baking.  Everyone that eats my baked pareve items cannot believe that there is no dairy in them.  I suggest that anyone who wants to make this recipe non-dairy try the Nucoa brand margarine, you won't be disappointed.  I did add some fruit fillings & baked the Hamantashen in my convection oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes (rotating the cookie sheets at 5 minutes) & they turned out great!

Delicious!!  The dough was a great pale yellow color and so tasty.  I used raspberry jam, prune filling and blackberry jam.  The pastries are still moist 3 days later.  Everyone loved them.  Next time, I would reduce the sugar a bit, though.

GREAT RECIPE!  More time was required for cooking (about 12 minutes total) as I took the prepared hamentashen out of the freezer only long enough for the oven to preheat.  I would be interested to know how long the original submitter leaves them out of the freezer before cooking them.  I also think I will cut them a bit bigger next time, just so I can fit more filling inside.  I used cherry pie filling (our favorite) and they came out terrific.  Highly recommended!

If you are looking for a recipe that make a decent pastry, then I think you may enjoy this version of hamantashen.  However...I was expecting this to taste like the authentic hamantashen that I am used to, and was pretty dissappointed.  I noticed where another person had suggesting using oil instead of butter and tried the recipe with that alteration, but the dough was still a bit too gooey and had trouble retaining the shape.  After being baked, it seemed that the taste was softer or chewier than traditional hamantashen should be..  
Again, this is a tasty cookie, but not is you are wanting to make “real” hamanstahen :)

I liked the dough and appreciated all the good recommendations and comments that helped make this recipe work. It is a very easy recipe - make sure you use a real filling and not jam/jelly for a substitute. Jam will reduce and even run out the sides leaving thin lining of filling. The time in the freezer is a must, even with special attention to pinching the sides into a triangle. You may still have ones that open up in the oven so don't get lazy or be in too much of a hurry. I also recommend brushing them with a beaten egg and then lightly sprinkling them with some ground cinnamon.

I made the dough in the afternoon and last night made the hamantashen with my 7 year old.  We used a 3" circumferance glass, lekvar and an apricot coconut filling.  

We did not freeze before baking and were very happy with the results for 12 minutes of baking.

These were very delicious, more butter cookie than biscuit which is just the way I like it.  Easy recipe to make, follow and worth the results.  Thanks so much!

DELICIOUS.  I only refrigerated the dough for about two, two and a half hours and it worked out okay.  I did have to bake them for about 12 minutes.  i had a hamantashen-baking party and we used all different kinds of jelly and jam fillings.  no poppyseed necessary.

Delicious Recipe, I adjusted based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I had only one stick of butter so I used 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup shortening.  I also threw a little honey in the wet ingredients and added the baking powder directly to my flour before I mixed.     Because I used the shortening I found the dough easier to work with and while working with one batch I kept the extra dough in the fridge.   Rolled between wax paper and baked on parchment.   They came out light, delicious, perfect and were gobbled up quickly.   Recipe is a keeper.

My 10 year old and I made this recipe and it won rave reviews at our Purim carnival! We got a little crazy and put mini chocolate chips into the batter.  It was delicious!! We only let it stay 3 hours in the refrigerator, and did not freeze at all before baking.  All held their shape.  I highly recommend this recipe.

These were good - I did think the dough was a bit sticky. I also used an egg wash to seal corners and sprinkled with some course sugar.

I think these are great.  They may not be exactly like a New York bakery, but I think the traditional ones are too bland anyway.  I thought these were a tasty and improved version!  They worked well for us, and the freezer trick helped.  We like to fill ours with chocolate chips or cherry pie filling.

I have always been a bit nervous about making hamentaschen since I remember them being so difficult to make when I was a kid. 
This recipe was easy and delicious!  I used real butter and just a touch more OJ.  I put the dough in the fridge for about 8 hours. The dough was too hard to roll out, so I stuck it in the microwave for about 10 seconds, and it was very easy to work with. 
I didn't bother with freezing, just pinched really well and not a single one popped open. I cooked these a bit longer. Maybe about 11 minutes. They never got brown, but the consistency was just right. 
I'm bookmarking this recipe, and am so glad I no longer have to be disappointed by store bought or afraid to make my own!

WONDERFUL!  Best Hamantashen I have ever made or eaten!  I used butter.  I also used the suggestion for putting them int he freezer - they came out absolutely beautiful!  I made half with canned Solo apricot filling.  The other half with homemade prune filling (cook on stovetop, 1 cup of chopped prunes, 1/3 cup water, 1 TBS lemon juice, ~2 TBS of honey - cook down until a paste consistency).

I grew up in a Jewish community and my 1st job was at a Jewish Bakery in NY. I loved everything in that bakery!!  This is exactly like the Hamantashen that I grew up with!! It is wonderful and truly easy to make!

All I can say is WOW!!!!!!! These were amazing!!! I made mine with  Bob's gluten-free all purpose flour and didn't have time to refrigerate for 2 hours so I just put the dough in the freezer for about 15 min. Also put poppy seeds in the dough and used peach mango orange spread/preserves for the filling. Came out delicate and sooooo delicious!!! Will definitely make again over and over:) Thanx for the awesome recipe!

I experimented a bit with cook time, and I completely agree that these taste best (and most authentic) when undercooked slightly. Of course cooking times will vary, but 9min worked for me. Be careful because even overcooking for 1-2min will leave you with a dry, crunchier cookie rather than a doughy treat.  I used cherry pie filling -- delicious! I recommend a gooey textured filling because I filled a few with chocolate chips and it seemed too dry.

Best Purim ever thanks to these cookies. I hadn't made these from scratch before and was very nervous, especially with my younger sisters helping me (Ages 4 & 5) but they were wonderful! The cookies tasted good enough to eat by them selves, and even when my siblings folded them wrong, the taste made them amazing. The only thing I did differently was you apple pie filling for them and it was great. It was like  a mini apple pie with a cookie crust. Beautiful.

This batter was great to work with IF you were sure to chill.  1/4" is way too thick.  Taste was okay...the orange juice gave it a bit of a kick I wasn't too fond of.

These were excellent!  They were very moist and were not on the serving plate for long!  I only put the dough in the fridge for a few hours, and then put the prepared cookies right into the oven.  This worked out fine for me.

Don't use my rating because I used 3 cups of cake flour instead of All Purpose Flour as described.  I enjoyed making these; easy to do.  However, they were a little to "cakey". Will try it again.  However, they were tasty and not too sweet.  Used Apricot preserves.

the only thing good about these was the filling! i worked in a bakery and have made hundreds perhaps thousands of hamentashen. these looked beautiful before they were baked...but they all opened up in the oven to look like oddly shaped blobs nothing resembling a triangle with a glob of jam in the middle. if they tasted good it would have made it a little better but me and my husband found them very bland.

Everybody loved them.  I like to use a variety of jams instead of just poppyseed filling.

This is the first time I've ever had Hamantashen. I thought they were good. I used the poppy seed filling but I think the cookie part is a good base and you could use different kinds of fillings. My kids love poppy seed stuff in general but they thought this was a strange flavor. It may have been the vanilla or flavoring in the canned filling. Overall, I liked it and made it as part of my teaching the kids about the tradition of Purim.

This was the worst dough for Hamantashen I have ever tried.
Not only was it difficult to work with it also didn't taste very good in the end.
I followed the instructions to the letter and was very disappointed. A waste of time and money.

This recipe seems to be easier than the one I've used for 40 years, and will use it this year.  I will add a special touch from my dear mom:  brush warm honey onto the hamantashen while they are cooling.  It keeps them very moist and just a bit sweeter!

I love making these cookies, they always taste so yummy.  I do have some issues with rolling them and keeping them from opening, but that might just be me.  :)
I will be making these again, many times!
Thank you for the delicious recipe!

I used the chocolate chips in the dough and filled them with a cream cheese frosting and raspberry pie filling.  Absolutely the best cookie I've ever made.  They were the hit of the lunch room.

These were very good.  I did have to make 2 substitutions because I started the dough and then realized I was out of some items.  I used milk in place of orange juice and almond extract instead of vanilla extract.  The dough held the shape of the cookie very well.  Non of my cookies leaked out jam like other recipies I have tried.  Everyone at work said they tasted like bakery cookies (not really like Hamantashen from NY bakeries).  They would probably be better with the orange juice(I will make sure I have it next time).  My filling was raspberry and apricot jams.  My favorite is the raspberry, but that is personal taste.  Would definately make these again.  Thanks!

These turned out really well. I did make a few small adjustments; I reduced the butter  to 1 cup, and increased the sugar to 1.5 cups. I used a variety of fillings including jam, poppy seeds and peanut butter with chocolate. They were a hit.

SO good!! I made mine with orange marmalade instead of poppyseed filling, and found it easier to pull off a small ball of dough and roll it into a circle rather than using a cookie cutter. Will definitely make many  MANY more.

These were yummy. I rolled them a bit thinner and really had to pinch the dough well for it to stay in shape. I also reduced the temp and baked at 350 degrees for 15 mins. I will make these every Purim, they were fun.

This was my first attempt at Hamantashen.  The recipe was simple and the cookies turned out great.  They looked beautiful and everyone commented on how delicious they were (we made them for an event at my daughter's school).  I will definitely keep this recipe and have even promised to pass it on to a couple of other moms.

These pastries are delicious!  The first time I made them, I rolled them too thick and they were a bit doughy.  I was careful to roll them thin the next time.  Also, make sure the edges are sealed tightly or the cookie will open up during baking.  I tried poppyseed filling and apricot preserves. The apricot is my favorite, so far.  When cool, I also like to dust them with icing sugar.

The base was really cakey, and while you could definitely taste the butter, it was really bland.

BEST recipe for Hamantashen!  This is an easy no fail recipe that I share with all my friends and they always thank me after making them.  They are different from the bakery ones in that they are SO MUCH BETTER!  I use butter.

I made these and they are the softest, lightest, most delicious ones yet. I used vegan Earth Balance sticks in place of butter and almond milk in place of orange juice. I really just didn't have the orange juice and wanted them to still be pareve. I took some to a meeting and people couldn't stop eating them! 

I chilled the dough and rolled it out on parchment paper to contain the mess. I did use a fair bit of flour under and on top of the dough to be able to remove the circles and move to the baking sheet (also lined with parchment). I followed the baking instructions to a t. I used canned pie filling (prune, apricot and raspberry). I also made some with chocolate chip cookie dough left over from another effort. All are great!

This dough is very tasty, but its also gooey.  I allowed the dough to chill in my fridge for about 4.5-5 hours, but it was still too gooey to roll out.  I ended up making small balls and smashing them flat with my hands.  My oven is strange and small so I had to make my Hamantashen in about 4 or 5 different bakings; this allowed me to experiment with baking temperatures, times, and sizes of the actual Hamantashen.  I found that the dough expanded at an alarming rate and only when I made tiny (about half the size I would normally make) Hamentashen did they actually cook to become a normal size.  Also, I increased the temperature from 190C to 200C and baked them for 16 mins.  After they are baked they are still quite gooey, but the fridge hardens them without losing the chewiness/softness.  Not bad :)  That being said, you should know the dough is very sweet as well.  I can eat a few at a time, but not too many because I start to feel sick from the sweetness.  I guess thats good though cos they'll last longer! :)

These were easy to roll and dough has nice consistency. I made some with raspberry jam which my husband dusted with powdered sugar and likend them to linzertorte cookies his grandmom made in her bakery. Thanks!
