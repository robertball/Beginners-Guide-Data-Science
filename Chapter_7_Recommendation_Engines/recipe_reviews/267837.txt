This was very good. A little messy to put together but well worth it. I didn't use 10 oz of I presume frozen spinach I just put 5 or 6 leaves of fresh baby spinach on each chicken breast.

Messy to make but so worth it.  I doubled the receipe and made it for my mom and dad.  Everyone's plate was clean, no leftovers.   For my dad to eat spinach was  a small miracle.
