This is a great recipe that tastes very similar to a traditional southern style banana pudding in cupcake form. The recipe I used for the frosting is as follows: 1-8 ounce package of softened cream cheese, 1 stick of real butter, 2 tsp. real vanilla extract plus seeds from 1 vanilla bean pod, 2 cups of sifted powdered sugar. Beat all ingredients together then fold in 1 container of cool whip. Pipe on cupcakes and enjoy!

These are AMAZING! I love banana pudding and this hits all the points. I usually bake from scratch, but you would never know this is a cake mix.

This was a great recipe.It did take some time to make but it was well worth it.I made my own cream cheese icing for the topping instead of using what was recommended.I would make these again everyone enjoyed!
