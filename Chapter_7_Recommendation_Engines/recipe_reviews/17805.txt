This was the best pound cake I ever made.  I am a baker, and this cake was great!!!!  I use brown extra large eggs, which seem to make the cake even richer.  I had never thought to use orange extract blended, with the other flavorings.  It was simply delicious!

We made this one with our Brownie Troop for a Girl Scout event and it was easy to make (with children) and very tasty.   Make sure the cream cheese and butter are at room temperature.   Also, I add the extracts to the wet ingredients before stirring in the dry ones.   It's easier that way.   Finally, I increased the orange extract to 1 full teaspoon since we were aiming for an orange pound cake.  Just right.

This is the best pound cake I have ever made or eaten. It was crisp on the outside - my family likes it that way. I used a decorative bundt pan and it did overflow so next time I will try a muffin pan for the extra that is left over. I also had to bake it longer. I took some to work and everyone wanted the recipe! Thanks for sharing! :)

Being from the Czech republic- I know a lot about bundt cakes. I tried this one and it came out amazingly delicious. The perfect pound cake taste and flavor+ ideal moisture. Definitely 5 stars to this recipe and to Gina. PS: I made it 2 days ago and making a new one today since the whole cake is gone(two people)now!!

The best ever. I made it for a family gathering and I experimented with
amaretto liquor and I got great raves. The original recipe tastes great too 
with the orange flavoring. Thanks Gina

This is a recipe everyone should have in their files.   Do not understand reviewers that said it didn't have enough flavor and wasn't moist.   Definitely have to use butter and beating is very, very important.  Thanks for submitting.

I really like this recipe! The cake came out moist and had alot of flavor. I would recommend using room temperature  butter and cream cheese. This gives the cake a lighter texture.

A very  moist and delicious cake - - - though personally would prefer a stronger flavor. Next time I will TRIPLE the amount of lemon and maybe even add some rind and real juice..... otherwise AWESOME - rich and tasty!!

Okay, after many attempts at other recipes, this is the one that my fiance goes crazy for (he's the REAL pound cake lover)! It's moist and turns out beautifully every time I've made it. I noted that there are some folks that said it turned out dry and I can't understand how. This one is a keeper, for sure - both for taste & ease. Thanks for a great recipe.

I love to bake and believe me, this is absolutely the most delicious pound cake I have ever tasted. It was easy to prepare and DIDN'T need icing or a complimentary scoop of ice cream.

It is now my favorite cake! Hats off to Gina Pruitt!

This cake was the 2nd pound cake I had ever baked and it came out wonderfully!! I did not have any orange flavoring so I used 1 teaspoon of lemon and 1 tsp of vanilla. I used a bundt pan and the cake came out clean an evenly colored. I had never baked a cake without preheating the oven and I think this will be my choice for baking pound cakes.

This recipe was easy to make and looked very nice.
The flavor however was very bland and I tried to make it better but nothing worked and ended up throwing it away.  A waste of ingredients.  Very dry.  Will not try it again.

I made this cake exactly as the recipe is written and took it to a church dinner.  It was placed on the dessert table next to a pound cake that looked just like it.  Not a crumb was left of my pound cake while the other cake was only half eaten.  I'll make this again - my husband and grandkids gave it 2 thumbs up!

WOW! I just threw out my favorite pound cake recipe that I had been using for 30 years. This is hands down a new favorite! I really like trying new recipes exactly as written, but I did not have lemon extract. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of orange extract with 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I also took a cup of sifted 2x sugar, 1/4 cup orange juice and half a tablespoon butter and heated it up, whisked it and poured it over half of the cake to let it soak in. I wanted to taste the cake without the glaze...so I only poured it over half of the cake. Without the glaze and with are fantastic! Thank you for this recipe!

A really good, basic-flavor pound-cake recipe. I had to bake it a bit longer because the tester came out still covered with batter at 65 minutes. I may have baked it a smidge too long, because it was a tad on the dry side. But the flavor is great, and I love the crisp top.

Just what a pound cake should be - crusty on the outside, moist on the inside.  Absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  Made it twice in two weeks for two different occasions.

I made this EXACTLY the way the recipe said and it was perfect. Doesn't have the oily moistness that store bought pound cake has. Drizzled a simple orange glaze made w/ 10x and orange juice concentrate and it was great.

This is a good, solid recipe. I  only used 2 cups of sugar and used almond and vanilla extracts. I thought the cake would dry out a bit while letting it sit in the oven but it turned out beautiful and delicious. A must try recipe!

Was looking for something easy, tasty and would go with several different desserts.  It was GREAT! Served it the first day as is, no icing, no nothing but cake, was just the right kind of moist, great taste, second day served a couple of pieces to friends with whip cream and fresh berries.  They loved it.  finally on the third day I used it in my trifle bowl with pudding and fruit, topped with whip cream.  Was absolutely delicious.  Thanks Gina for sharing a great recipe.

Great taste for all the time involved, made me wish I had a food processor, but would reccommend highly for a family gathering. Will feed many people because it is so rich you cant take large slice.

This is the best pound cake recipe I have saw yet and this is a keeper. I have not even sliced it yet nut you just know from the batter how good the cake is. U can tell that the cake is moist and very soft. The only think I did diffferent was that I added a 1/2 cup of heavy cream. So I alternated the flour and milk. Flour first, then a little milk and on and on but always end with flour. I did not use the flavorings that the recipe listed I used 3tsp of vanilla and 3 tsp butter and the smell is amazing.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. Thanks for this recipe this is a keeper for sure!!!!!

This was NOT a moist cake, but then, pound cakes aren't generally moist.  I was disappointed with this recipe - made it for Christmas for my family.  The cooking time was way off - like 15-20 minutes.  I don't believe it was a problem with my oven as I've never experience that before.

I made this cake for "strawberry shortcake" and it was delish! Very moist and I love the addition of lemon, orange, and vanilla extracts. This cake will be a wonderful staple to serve with chocolate sauce, seasonal fruit or whatever. I've never tried homemade pound cake and I'll never buy one again!

I was actually looking for another recipe when I found this one.  Sounded good so I decided to try it last night.  I added a package of strawberry gelatin mix to the batter, baked it as directed, cooled it and drizzled it with a thick confectioner's glaze.  I'm getting a lot of praise for this cake.  Thanks Gina!

I'm sorry to say-this cake was dry.  I cooked it less time than indicated on the recipe so as to avoid dryness. The flavor is fine, but if I were to make it again, I would use oil instead of the butter.  I'm certain this would make the cake much better.

Just made this cake..was light and oh so wonderful.You couldn't ask for a better pound cake. Sorry for those that it didn't work for..you missed out!! The only thing I did different was I preheated my oven..I'm a preheater..I took it out after 1 hour and 25 mins..the top is sooo crunchy and yummy..topping with a glaze and shared with the neighbors! I tried to upload a picture but it needs to be resized.

We thought this cake was good, but not the best.  Does not have enough flavor.  I think 2 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. each of lemon and orange would help.

Even without the Orange extract which I could not find in the store it was delicious. Agree that the 50 min bake time is just right.

My husband's coworker's devoured the entire thing! It went over very despite my hitting "broil" instead of bake to start the cake! I had to scrape off the thick burned crust and put it back in! Thankfully, it turned out fine!

In my personal opinion this cake did not live up to the claim of being moist.  After tasting it I was upset that I had waisted so many eggs on such a dry cake.  I wasn't that thrilled with the flavor either...on the fruity side; but that is a matter of personal opinion.

My 4 year old daughter and I made this delicious pound cake for my husband's birthday.  He always asks for one and most recipes I've tried end up too dry.  This cake was very moist and needed nothing to go with it.  We just sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar on top for looks.  YUM!

One of the best pound cake recipes I've ever made.  Moist and delicious.  I had to bake the pound cake about 15-20 minutes longer than the recipe calls (probably due to my oven).  Thank you Gina!

This was a very easy cake to make.  It just took a little time beating in all 6 eggs on at a time, and also the cooking time and cooling time are long, so it's not real quick cake.  I made it as a birthday cake that was served with ice cream and the toppings.  It was way too rich to be served along side huge scope of ice cream with caramel and hot fudge and all the fixings.  It is wonderfully favorful and very, very rich.  When I make it again I will serve it with tea or coffee and with nothing served along side it except maybe some fresh, unsweetened berries.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delish!!  Hubby says it’s a keeper. I used only 2-1/2c. sugar and I added 2 dashes of cardamom. I also used 1/2 teaspoon of orange, vanilla, lemon & almond. It was gone in 3 days. I had to make another one today!

This cake was perfection.  My family and friends love good, old-fashioned, homemade pound cake.  This recipe is now my go-to for it.  I did make some changes: I reduced the sugar to 1.75 cups, and it was just right for my family and me.  Also, I didn't include the fruit extracts, and just put in two tablespoons of pure vanilla extract.   Placing it in a cold oven before turning on the heat (as the recipe instructs) really makes for a delicious crust.

I made this pound cake over the 4th of July for an event at my son's house.  I followed the directions as written.  At the end of an hour the cake was done and looked beautiful, but I followed directions and left it in the oven and additional 15 minutes.  At the end of that time, it was burned and dry.  I think if I had taken it out instead of leaving it in the oven it would have turned out great.  I suspect leaving it in the oven is the reason so many people commented on review that this cake is dry.  When reviews are majority great for a recipe, I think cooker error is the reason a recipe didn't turn out.  In my case, I think my oven probably holds too much heat to leave the cake in it and it continued cooking too long.  Not the fault of the recipe.  I will make it again.  By the way, I scraped the burn off, iced the cake and took it anyway, and served it with strawberries and whipped cream, but it was very dry and not so good.

This cake wasn’t as good as I had hoped. The flavor was ok, but it was really dry. It also needs some sort of glaze on it to help with the moisture problem.

This made for a nice Sunday dessert.  I made it exactly as it was written and was not dissapointed. I matched it up with an orange glaze in which I also found  on Allrecipes and it turned out just as good as I had hoped.

I have been making this pound cake for over 5 years now.  It is just the best.  I mean the best...  AND I love pound cake.

The recipe is easy to follow and turns out just great. When I have it I use a mix of orange/lemon peel that I grate myself and some orange and lemon juice. If I don't have fruit handy I use the flavor.

This is a decent pound cake, but nothing all that special--at least in my opinion, but I will admit I'm difficult to impress when it comes to pound cakes.  I made this for a work party and received numerous compliments.  Not sure about the baking time on this--it's a little off for my oven.  I think I'll just bake a bit extra (about 15 minutes) instead next time.  I did add another half teaspoon of orange extract to make it more orange-y per request.  thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for my sister, and she loved it. Although it wasn't the recipe she wanted, she still loved this one. She liked the sweetness and texture.

Best. Cake. Ever!!! I will never buy another store bought pound cake. Gina's recipe had the best taste, texture, and was perfectly moist and incredible. 10 stars - this is my new favorite! Only thing I didn't have on hand was the orange extract so I used vanilla and almond. Beautiful & delicious cake!
