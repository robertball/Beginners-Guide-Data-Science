This was a great dish.  I added a can of Cream of Chicken and it was very good.  Best part is I was able to use up most of my left-over Thanksgiving turkey!

After reading the other reviews I tried this recipe and added the mushroom soup. I also added mushrooms. My husband and 13-year-old loved it--and they're not big rice fans. My 9-year-old wouldn't touch it (but she's picky!). I thought it was pretty good but still a tad on the dry side, but I will make it again. It's a great way to use up leftover turkey!

This recipe starts with uncooked rice but the rice must be cooked ahead which was confusing. That made it take much longer than it would have if recipe had just said to use cooked rice. Also, if you don't add lots of wet ingredients it is very dry. It probably should have had canned soup or something.I added soup, chicken broth and it was still dry.

I had to spice this up a little but my family loved it! After reading all the reviews here is what I did:
 Being that it is no longer thanksgiving and the reason I stumbled upon this recipe is because I was looking for a recipe for boneless skinless turkey breast I cubed about a pound of turkey breast and seasoned it with salt, white pepper (because I'm out of black at the moment) sage and rosemary. I cooked it in waterless cookware on top the stove, when almost done I added a small onion, about a tsp of minced garlic, fresh broccoli and about a tbsp of butter then let it simmer until onion and broccoli softened just a little. 
I cooked my rice according to directions but added a little salt, a little rosemary and a little butter. 
Then, I mixed turkey and broccoli mixture with rice and probably a little more than a cup of shredded Colby jack in 9x13 baking dish. 
After that, I added one can cream of chicken soup to a small mixing bowl along with half the can filled with chicken broth and the other half filled with heavy cream. I whisked the ingredients together and poured over turkey, rice and broccoli mixture.
I melted the butter and mixed with crumbled crackers as directions stated, only I didn't have wheat crackers so I used the oyster crackers I had left and some butter crackers I had in the cabinet.
I baked it on 350 for closer to 30 min.

Bon appetite!

Wonderfully simple addition to the "turkey leftover recipe" repertoire!  I used cooked noodles instead of rice and fresh broccoli instead of frozen, which made for bright, crunchy flavor and color.  I actually just put it all in a skillet and it was ready in 5 minutes.  Much fresher and better than Bertolli! ;)

This was terrible.  I made it as stated on recipe since I forgot to read reviews first.  It was dry and tasteless.  We added a can of cream of mushroom soup and some milk to it just so we could use it.  It still was not good.  WILL NOT MAKE AGAIN!

It's casserole, not gourmet food and for casserole it's pretty yummy.  I used minute rice instead which cut down on time, added 2 cans cream of muchroom soup mixed with a little milk and a dash of worcestershire sauce, and a handful of diced onions.  I didnt put the broccoli in the casserole because my kids love broccoli and I wasnt sure if they would eat it all together.  I also used corn flakes instead of crackers because that was what was in my cupboard.  I dont usually change recipes this much but I used what I had and it turned out good.

I made this tonight with leftover turkey. It did taste fine, but needed something "wet" to keep it together. I read and re-read the recipe expecting to see that I had left out cream of mushroom soup or something like that. I may mix some soup in with what we have leftover to see how that works.

This is a good base recipe, but I tweaked it quite a bit due to the reviews that said it was too dry and sorta tasteless. 

So here's what I did: I added salt, pepper, garlic and cream of chicken soup with about 1/3 cup milk (you might want more if you're making a 9x13 casserole) and instead of crackers I used left over stuffing. 

I layered the ingredients like this: soup, milk and shredded turkey (these three, I mixed together) salt, pepper, garlic. Then I layered the thawed broccoli and the cooked rice. On top of that I added the stuffing and then put shredded cheese on top of it all. I omitted the butter as the stuffing was already made with it. 

I covered it for the first 20 minutes (to cook the broccoli), then uncovered it and baked for an additional 10 minutes so the cheese would melt and the top would brown just a bit. 

This was a huge hit and will go in my recipe box for the next time I have leftover turkey!

Update 11-29-15 - I made this again; this time using green beans instead of broccoli, and gravy instead of soup and milk, still layering it the same way as I did before. Turned out pretty darned good. I do think I'd use twice as much gravy next time (two bottles instead of one). 

I always hesitate to make this each year because it seems like too much work, but I need to remember how fast, easy, and good this is and how much my family enjoys it.

Tasty, fast, easy recipe. My husband liked it, but we both thought A. too dry from the massive amount of  cracker crumbs and B. would have been better with less rice. 
My recommendation: Decrease rice by 1/4 c. ( dry), decrease cracker crumbs by 1/2 ( 3.5 oz), add chicken broth or canned cream soup for moisture to cooked rice, turkey, broccoli mixture.

This was nice! The goal was to get all of the leftover Thanksgiving fixin's out of the way. I had already made a beautiful turkey/rice soup... This was the leftover, leftovers of Thanksgiving-- the very end--you know what I'm talking about the weird wing meat.  I added a can of Cream of Chicken condensed soup because the other peeps on this site said that it was dry, used raw broccoli that didn't get cooked, sautéed an onion, and used LEFTOVER stuffing as the topper It was delicious... made of stuff that would have been thrown out... Now if only I could figure out what to do with that dang cranberry sauce!

This was a very good way to use leftover turkey but it would be quite dry without the addition of a can of creamed soup. I halved the recipe since it was for just two people so I added half a can of cream of chicken soup with half  a can of half and half whisked in. I poured it over the turkey,broccoli,rice mixuure in a 1.5 qt. Casserole dish. I topped with leftover stuffing and drizzled a little melted butter over it and cooked for 40 min. at 350. I made my rice using leftover turkey brothinstead of water but chicken broth or buillion would also work.

I added some other  ingredients to this recipe and it was great!!  Add the following ingredients to give it more flavor:  in a skillet heat 2tablespoons of olive oil, sautée 1medium onion, 1/2 cup celery stalk (about 2 stalks) until tender crisp.  Add 2 minced garlic cloves to the skillet and cook for about 2 minutes.  Add to this mixture 1 can cream of mushroom soup (add half a can of water to the skillet).    Add about 1- 2 cups low sodium chicken broth.  Simmer over medium heat.  Take skillet off heat.    Add fresh black pepper to taste.  Add the rice ( rice has to be previously cooked , aldente), turkey and cheese.  Add broccoli.  I used fresh broccoli and steamed it until crisp tender in the microwave. Pour in casserole dish and sprinkle more cheese over it.  Cracker / bread crumbs is not necessary, but I did use plain bread crumbs with the melted butter. My family enjoyed this dish!  Try it this way and you won't regret it!

I used plain bread crumb instead of crackers. I agree with some others that it needs a cream of some kind of soup.  I still enjoyed the flavors although it was dry. I will make this again with a few small variations.

This tasted good but was so dry. Is there an ingredient missing? Wasn't sure what brand/type of crackers to use. I used Triscuit baked whole wheat crackers.

Made this tonight to get rid of leftover Easter turkey. It was tasty but room for added flavor. I used 1 bag of Uncle Ben’s Ready Rice jasmine flavor instead of cooking the rice, then added 1 can of cream of chicken soup, about 3/4 cup leftover gravy and a big dollop of sour cream to the rice, chicken, cheese and broccoli mixture. Spread in 9x13, topped with panko crumbs, more cheese and drizzled it with about 3 Tbs butter. It was mild in taste and good comfort food in my opinion. Next time I’ll add some herbs and spices to increase the flavor. Thanks for a good basic recipe to play with!

I added condensed soup(made from scratch), 1/2c of water, 1/2 cup of cream. Dish turned out moist. It was okay, not mindblowing, but not horrible either. I haven't decided if I'll make it again.

It was dry following the recipe as printed.  I'll add this or cream of celery should I try again.

Great base recipe for left over turkey! What I did differently is added a can of cream of chicken soup,  with a can of water.  I season the water for the rice with on ok powder,  garlic powder,  black pepper,  and Lowreys season salt with a dash of cayenne pepper.  I also used those same seasonings when mixing the ingredients all together before putting them in the pan.  It cam out moist and flavorful! Delicious!

We liked it.  I read the other reviews and added to the mixture 1/2 cup of chicken stock, and 1/2 cup of half & half.  (No cream of mushroom or chicken available.)  It was still a little dry, but very tasty.  I also used basmati rice, and half cheddar and half jalapeno jack cheese, and cauliflower in addition to the broccoli.  Very easy to throw together.
