Wonderful! Tasted just like my mom's pancit!

I used rice noodles and soaking them for about ten minutes did the trick, but make sure to break the noodles before soaking them or you'll have some really long noodles. The noodles, when cooked, will come out with an al dente texture to them.. Even Mom's leftovers still had that a day or two later.  It's just the nature of the beast.

Just a couple of things: I switched in green onions for the diced onions for color, used leftover chicken (this is a great dish for any leftover meat, including beef and pork) and used garlic powder to control the garlicky flavor better.  Perhaps most importantly, I used Kikkoman soy sauce to cook with.  Growing up, Kikkoman was for cooking with, due to it's lighter flavor, and La Choy was for seasoning at the table.  I still follow that rule, and it works very well for pancit.

I would highly recommend adding as many veggies and meats as you would like, just increase the amount of sauce you need. 

The only warning I'll leave anyone with is that I found the meat too salty after having been sauteed with the veggies in the soy sauce and oil.  Next time I prepare this, I will saute the veggies by their lonesome until just about done, then throw in the meat to warm, followed almost immediately by the noodles.

Play with it, make it your own, and enjoy!  This is an awesome, easily prepared party dish.  You'll be amazed by how much is made with one package of noodles.

When you shop for the rice noodles, look for the package labeled "pancit bihon", or "bihon". Keep in mind that not all rice noodles are the same. Some rice noodles are for Vietnamese pho, while some are for pad thai. I am Filipina, and I like to garnish my pancit with thinly sliced green onions. They add color and additional flavor. Another traditional topping is sliced hard boiled eggs.

This is great recipe for pancit - for those who didn't rate it at 5 - either you didn't follow the recipe, or you don't know what pancit bihon is all about.  The flavor is just right and if it isn't what you've had before then it's just an adjustment of ingredients.  As a first generation Flip, let me tell you that this is the recipe to try if your craving pancit!!!!  I personally prefer shrimp and shitaki mushrooms mixed in - simply because that's how my family made it - so without those two ingredients it seems like something is missing.  Soak the rice noodles until they are soft and pliable/wiggley.  I added maybe a cup more of broth - some like it on dry side, I like it moist but not soupy - some like it that way too!  Try it!

My hubby is Filipino and when some of his family visited and had been in the states eating our food for so long, I thought I'd be brave and prepare one of their favorite dishes; pancit. I followed this recipe with only a couple exceptions. I added small shrimp along with the chicken and used "Silver Swan" soy sauce from the Philippines which we are fortunate enough to get at a local Oriental market. I have to tell you, I have never received so many compliments on a dish as I did this one. Our Philippine relatives were stunned that an American could make their national dish just like they do back home.  My husband's aunt even asked for MY recipe.  Oh my gosh,  talk about anchored. Have since made this dish combining chicken and pork cut into bite size pieces and included the shrimp as well. Hubby took it to an office pot luck and while there called to ask me to fax the recipe to his office so he could copy it and give it to 13 people who had asked for it.  I don't do this often but often enough to get rave reviews every time it graces our table!  And yes, it makes a lot but we enjoy it even more re-heated and it is the perfect dish to share at a potluck. I can't thank you enough for sharing this tremendously popular recipe!

Very authentic!! I did change a little though, yet it still gets a 5 because the recipe is still pretty much the same. I used strips of pork because thats how I grew up eating it. I sauteed the garlic (4 cloves) and some green onion. After removing garlic/onions from wok, I put fresh ground pepper on raw pork and cooked it, splashing some soy sauce on halfway through. I then removed the pork and cooked the veggies, adding the garlic and onions back to the pan and putting additional soy sauce on them. Then once cooked most of the way, I added the pork and noodles until heated all the way through. I have to say, a bit more flavorful than my dads....

This is delicious. I made it as a vegetable dish though without the chicken. I used pancit noodles which I think is something different then the dried rice noodles stated in the recipe. I didn't place them in a bowl with water to soften them but broke them apart a little, then mixed them in with the vegetables and they became softer once they were in the steam for a bit. Also, I put 1 oxo cube in a 1/2 cup water and put that in the pan after cooking the onion and garlic and before putting in the other vegetables. It gave the dish a very nice flavor. I served this with chicken adobo, lumpia, and Jasmine rice.

First time making pancit and this was easy!The noodles soften in warm water while I chopped the onions and garlic. I used sesame oil , added 2 tbsps of Fish sauce and an extra tbsp of soy sauce to give the noodles a little more flavor. Added some pepper flakes and slices of fried egg for presentation(per my Phillipina friend's suggestion!)and voila! I will make this again!

My husband just got out of the Marine Corps and I have been craving pancit that my phillipino co-workers used to make.  This is a wonderful recipe, I would not change a thing.  My family which is German has never had pancit and they loved it!  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

Didn't really enjoy this. The texture of the noodles were... not very good. The flavor seemed pretty bland. Serrano hot sauce had to save it to be edible.

First time making and eating pancit. I thought it sounded tasty and wanted to make it for my dad's birthday this weekend, but, wanted to try it out before. I have a Filipino co-worker and she said it was good and gave me some tips. Pretty good and easty to make. Most likely, I will make pancit this weekend. Thanks for the recipe!

This is very similar to a recipe for pancit that I have.  I grew up going to a church where more than half the congregation was Fillipino, so we always had pancit and lumpia during potlucks and church dinners.  When I made my pancit, I warmed some water in the coffee maker and added the hot water to a bowl and let my rice noodles soak while i cooked the vegitables.  I had some leftover salad shromp, so I used that.  I started by cooking the garlic and onions in a bit of chicken stock, and then added some celery and carrots. I added cabbage last, as that takes the least amount of time to cook.  I added everything together and added the soy sauce and a tad more chicken stock to make it the tendancy I wanted.  I also added a jar of bamboo shoots simply because I LOVE bamboo shoots.

Great simple recipe. You will need to make it your own for the right sauce amount. A great idea is to serve with egg rolls. Just take the chicken, cabbage, veggie mix and put inside wonton wrappers and fry in oil. Just use a little extra chicken and veggies in your recipe. I also use shrimp with my chicken for some extra flavor. I use the precooked shrimp to save time. Excellent recipe. Leftovers are just as good if not better.

This dish is meant to be light and flavored just enough to still enjoy the fresh ingredients. If you think it’s bland then add more of your personal ingredients to it…..but PLEASE, don’t bother to call it Pancit after that! As a FILIPINA born and raised, I can say that this recipe is pretty true to form. Let's face it; it’s hard to find calamansi in rural USA so a squeeze of lemon just before eating works just fine. I like my Pancit moist so I add a little chicken broth during the stir fry process. If I’m feeling fancy, then right before serving I’ll add the traditional toppings of chiceron, chopped boiled eggs, and green onions.

We really liked this. I used onions, green peppers, mushrooms, cole slaw mix and bean sprouts as my vegetables. I made a simple teriayaki sauce of 1/4 cup soya sauce, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/8 cup lemon juice, 2 tsps chopped garlic and 1/2 tsp hot pepper ginger paste, bring to a boil and whisked in dissolving flour until thickened, then I poured over the stir fry instead of just soya sauce. Made lots, great leftovers.

Great Recipe. I made 3 batches of this using this recipe as a guideline and everyone loved it. I was shocked! A little tip for those who are time constrained or lazy like me. I utilized a whole roasted chicken for my meat and simply bought cole slaw mix for my cabbage and carrots portion. Added drippings from roasted chicken for extra flavor. I also boiled a pot of water and stuck my noodles inside for about a minute or two. Allowed to remain in hot water for another 5 minutes and drained. Cutting the pancit is a must and its much easier to make in small batches but be careful with the soy sauce.

Very easy and yummy. Made recipe exactly except I added bean sprouts, and 2 tblsp patis (fish sauce) and used 8oz pkg noodles.  I also used Silver Swan filipino soy sauce as another person recomended. I added a little water if it got too dry while cooking.  Before I added the softened noodles, I pushed all the veggies to the sides of the pan, letting all the juices in the middle.  This allowed me to immerse the noodles in the sauce to better coat the noodles.  Will definately make again!

This is a great base recipe to start with.  On the advice of a Filipino friend, I sauteed all the veg with the chicken, removed from the wok, then threw the noodles (which I soaked til soft) in the wok with 1 cup of chicken stock.  I put the veg mixture back in, covered for a couple minutes, tossed, heated through and added soy sauce to taste.  The entire family inhaled it!!  Will definitely make this again.  (I also used broccoli-slaw in place of cabbage.)

Excellent!  I used to have a recipe for Pancit that a coworker from the Philippines gave me, but it got lost during one of our cross country moves. I'm so thankful that I found this recipe.  It tasted just like I remembered and it was a hit with all of our recent dinner guests.  Everyone was begging me to make it more often.  I certainly will!  I did take the advice of one of the other reviewers and I waited to add the protein until most of the soy sauce had been soaked into the veggies.  It definitely saved it from being too salty for my standards.  All in all, though, a wonderful version of Pancit.

One of my family's favorite recipe's!  So easy and so good.  Have fun with it and add things you like.  I add shrimp, snow peas or snap peas, green onions and minced ginger.  I also use bagged coleslaw mix which saves a lot of time.    Really simple and delicious.  When I bring this to potlucks people devour it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this had great flavor but it had WAY too many noodles for our taste.  Next time I'll make it with half the amount of noodles.

I wanted to submit a review without a rating, but the system wouldn't permit it.  Although my results were somewhat less than satisfactory, it may well have been because of my inexperience in working with rice noodles.  The directions say to put the rice noodles in warm water until they're soft.  How soft is soft?  I drained them when they were flexible.  However, when we went to eat the finished dish, the noodles were definitely chewy, far more so than in any pancit I've ever eaten.  You might call them al dente.  Having read other reviews about the dish being dry, I put everything back in a pot again, added a can of chicken broth, and simmered it for a while, thinking the additional liquid would be absorbed by the noodles and soften them.  Well, the broth was absorbed, but the noodles didn't seem to be any softer, nor did they after I added some water and simmered it for a while longer.  We ate it, and although the flavor was right on, the texture was not that good.  I would like to make it again because I like pancit, but not until I figure out the rice noodle problem.

I've never had pancit before, so I wasn't sure how it was supposed to taste.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it seemed a bit bland to me.  Perhaps I needed to use a larger onion for more flavor, but it seemed like it would benefit from a bit of ginger.  Nevertheless, we liked it and I'll probably make it again.

Good for a light recipe, a little bland but I'll probably make it again.  We had to use the stockpot to cook everything because it wouldn't all fit in our large skillet.  I used one package of Dynasty Maifun rice sticks (the only rice noodles at our grocery), which is only 6.75 ounces instead of 12 but I was happy with the resulting noodle:veggie ratio.  I had to add more oil, about two tablespoons total, to keep the onions and garlic from sticking.  I followed others' advice and used 1 pound of lean sliced pork instead of chicken.  With the changes it still came out to about six lunch-sized servings, each with 400 calories, 11 grams fat, 560mg sodium, 48g carbohydrate, 8g fiber and 26g protein.

This was delicious and easy, but the prep time is not realistic.  I spent at least a 1/2 hour peeling and chopping vegs.  But, nevertheless, we ate a little later than I expected, but it was worth the wait.  I did add a little chicken broth toward the end, so it wouldn't dry out, and tossed in 1/2 bell pepepr I had to use, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I had trouble with the noodles not getting soft when done as the recipe said.  I finally ended up cooking them, but then they stuck in one gooey mess.  It was my first time trying rice noodles, though, so I'm not going to rate the recipe according to that.  The flavor was excellent.

My best friend is Filipino and I've eaten a lot of his mom's food, and I don't think this tasted very good.  Maybe its because I used Japanese soy sauce instead of Filipino, but I will definitely use a different recipe I found on a Filipino recipe site.

Great recipe and confirmed by Philippino friends as the real thing. I add about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and increase the soy sauce to about half a cup. Mushrooms are a great addition. It always tastes better the second day and is a great recipe to use leftover cabbage or cooked chicken.  It works with almost every type of Asian noodle and is quick, simple and just delicious.

This is an awesome dish.  I loved it.  Tasted just like something I would order in a restaurant.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, but I also added a few chopped mushrooms and green onions as well.  Also, I only used a 6 ounce container of rice noodles and I still wound up with ample noodles.  I think that if you used a 12 ounce package of noodles that the proportions would be way off - you would have waaaaay too many noodles.  I think the next time I make this recipe, I will also add some bean sprouts, as I think those would also work with this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I needed a Philipine dish to make for our church missions dinner and this was one of the recipes. I made it and it was very good. Someone was sitting beside me that did not know I had taken this dish and they said I don't know what this is but it is really good. People were asking me for the recipe. Thanks for a good recipe. I am actually going to make it for another dinner tomorrow. The only thing I did different was added quite a bit more soy sauce I like it a little soupier.

What a versatile recipe! This stuff is great on its own, though to make it better we add in extra noodles (soba), hoisin sauce and other vegetables such as red pepper slices and water chestnuts - maybe some extra chicken. This can be easily doubled for a crowd.

I LOVE PANCIT! I soak my noodles while i cook the chicken, so about 15-20mins. I use kikkoman soy sauce, and green onions instead of white/red onions. Pancit has a lot of flavor but then not a lot, but it is a perfect amount! It takes a while to cook but it is time well spent!

I'm half Filipino, and this tastes just like my mom's! I added about 2 tsp minced fresh ginger and a few stalks of celery, sliced. Omitted the chicken (am vegetarian) and I did not feel the recipe suffered at all. I did have to add quite a bit more soy than called for. I like to drizzle with Sriracha for some added heat. Easy, authentic and delicious!

Great basic pancit recipe. I soak my rice noodles in chicken stock for added flavor and nutrition. Be sure to use the thin "rice thread" vermicelli type noodles not the round or flat noodles. Makes the dish light and fluffy. I also use half fish sauce and half soy sauce for a richer flavor. Excellent dish!

I used about 6 oz of vermicelli rice noodles as thats all I had on hand. I had a bag of broccoli slaw (broccoli, carrots, cabbages) so I just used that. I didnt have any lemon so I substituted lime. Turned out very good. Next time Ill try to use more noodles.

This was the best pancit recipe I've fond here on the mainland.  I'm from HI so we may or may not use patis for flavor instead of the shoyu.  However, shoyu makes it just as tasty.

My husband gave this a 3/5, or an 8/10 (we like the 10 scale). He really liked it.

We modified the recipe by adding "some" chicken broth (probably 3/4 cup) and about 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce to cut the soy sauce taste and make a bit more "sauce" to go on the noodles. I think it really came out a lot better than if it was just soy sauce alone! We also added some (powdered) ginger. Would've used fresh but didn't have any on hand. We'll be making this again. Our kids loved it, ate the leftovers tonight!

Turned out just like my mom's pancit. I was intimidated to ever try and cook this because my mom never measures anything so I never knew how much of the ingredients she used. I followed this recipe but added a few of my own. My mom used to use oyster sauce so I added about 1/4 cup (give or take a little more or less) of oyster sauce. While the noodles were warming I added chicken broth to add moisture. I just kept adding little by little until the noodles were cooked to my liking. I will definitely be making this again!

First time making this and it was delicious! Tastes better than the coveted pancit my mom's coworker makes for everyone. I added celery, green onions instead of regular, a bit of ginger, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and black pepper for more flavor. I think next time I'll add more cabbage and green onions and maybe soak the noodles in some chicken broth. Great recipe though!

i don't have a lot of experience with asian food so i may have had the wrong type of noodles, or i used about 3x too many (even tho my package said 6.75 oz), or this is a bad recipe.  which resulted in it being a little dry.  otherwise, the texture was great -- used broccoli slaw in place of the carrots because easy! and left out the chicken to make it vegetarian.  
anyway, needs either less noodles or more sauce -- going to try to find an asian-y sauce to pour over the leftovers and go from there...

This was a pretty tasty dish!  I added some red pepper because we like things spicy...my company really enjoyed it.  I gave it four stars however, because the texture of the rice noodles isn't really to my liking.  Not the recipes fault though!

This is my favorite.  My mom would add a little bit brown sugar to neutralize the soy sauce and vinegar and to add a hint of sweetness.  Also, we use the flour noodles for our version of Pancit (it's the thick yellowish one).  We sometimes use the "vermicellish" type (I don't know what that is called), but I prefer the flour noodles as it absorbs the flavor and when you settle it after cooking it dries up a little but the flavor is still there.

We'd add young corn and substitute small strips of pork over chicken.

I love pancit so I was excited to try this. It was good but I felt like it was missing something. I added a little more soy sauce and garlic to give it more flavor. However, I will make this again.

Excellent recipe. Not quite mei fun but close enough. My kids like this and it is healthy. I have shredded my own vegetables but I buy them now so I have enough time to cook everything after work. I also add shredded cabbage *cole slaw bag. It doesn't take much. UPDATE I add oyster sauce, fish oil and soy for my sauce. Delish!

I love this recipe. It's become one of my "go-to" recipes. My teenager especially loves it, even though he hasn't yet developed a taste for Asian foods. Next time I'd like to try this with baby shrimp added, like my Filipino sister-in-law does hers.

My mother in law is from the philippines, so we make this a LOT.  We do not add garlic, add two handfuls of fresh sliced green beans, and about 3/4 can of chicken broth when simmering. DELICIOUS!

It was quick and easy, but a little bland.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and added rooster sauce to my serving for some kick.  I will make this again.  

I have made this several times.  There are never any leftovers!  Save the rice noodles for another dish and use real Pancit canton wheat noodles for this one....it makes a WORLD of difference.  Pancit noodles have so much flavor!  I get mine at the local Asian food market.  Also..instead of chicken I now use ground pork.  So so good....5 stars good with the right noodles and ground pork.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used cubed tofu instead of meat.  I guess I missed the boat by doing that, because the only flavor in the whole dish was the soy sauce. I didn't care the noodles either.

I really had to do a lot of tweaking to make this Pancit taste good.  It was lacking SO much flavor when I followed the recipe exactly.  I tried adding sesame oil, like the other reviewers noted.  I used more soy than was called for, and I squeezed a whole lemon into it.  It was still bland, so I added extra onion powder, garlic powder, and threw in some teriyaki sauce.  That seemed to do the trick.  I used bagged slaw to make it easy, and I added a handful of sesame seeds.  I will make this again and keep playing with it until I have it perfected. :)

This was certainly easy but it seems to be lacking something in the recipe. It will be a repeat that I play around with however because it's so simple. I used prepackaged cole slaw mix instead of shredding the cabbage and carrots by hand. It was extremely convenient.

This was a super yummy dish, and pretty easy. My husband used to work with several Filipino women and they often brought several versions of this dish to work. He loved it and has been craving it for a while. The squeezed lemon definitely adds a great touch!

The flavor of this dish was not great. Liked it more once the lemon was squeezed over the top. Threw away the leftovers. Would not make again.

pretty good! I did this one a while ago so i don't remember everything... but i remember that the lemon was an essential ingredient! It was so much better after we squeezed that sucker all over the meal. :) I think we added more vegetables than it called for, 'cause the more the merrier!

Made this recipe many times and it's very delicious pancit! The only change I made was using sesame oil instead of vegetable oil because it's what I have on hand.

Been very successful in alternating meats such as pork and shrimp, turns out just as good. For pork, I used tenderloins once and thick slabs of bacon another time. When I cooked it with the bacon, I substituted 1 teaspoon with the bacon oil instead of the other oils.

This is a great recipe and very flexible for vegans out there. Simply add your favorite meat analog or cut firm tofu into small cubes, baste with soy sauce, and put in the oven till golden looking, then top the dish with it after it's done. I took the vegan version to a dinner with very heavy meat eaters and they loved it.

I tried this recipe for the first time and no one knew I did the pancit.This was my first time making it. The only thing I did different was to soak the noodles for 10 min and then rinsing with cold water. My wife never soaks her noodles. The recipe is great for those who are starting to cook noodles. Once you learn this technique you can switch it up and and use other veggies your kids will eat.

While this is a good start on pancit... it lacked something. I haven't put my finger on what that "it" is, but next time I make it I am going to add some chicken broth (from the chicken I boil for it).

I had no idea what pancit was. I've never seen it on a restaurant menu so I wanted to try it.  From the recipe, I could tell it would be Asian and healthy which is always a plus for dinner plans. We had it for dinner tonight & it was very good in spite of, or perhaps because of, the simple ingredients.  What a fresh tasting, satisfying meal!  The only thing I will do differently next time is soak the rice noodles a bit longer. They had a tendency to stick together...  Other than the aforementioned kitchen malfunction on my part, this is excellent & I'll make it again.  Thanks for the great dinner idea!

I happened to have all the ingredients on hand at the right moment. Leftover roasted chicken, half a head of cabbage, etc. This was an easy and flavorful way to use up the leftovers I had hanging around. I used Ponzu sauce instead of the soy sauce and added a dash of Asian seasoning. While it tasted fine, I thought the dish was a little colorless in appearance since all of the ingredients are so pale. Next time around I would use a red onion, red cabbage, and maybe add a red or yellow sweet bell pepper and some kale or other greens for some more color. That said, it was tasty, I used my leftovers creatively and that was my intent when I choose this recipe. Maybe Napa cabbage would provide more color. It makes A LOT! So now I have a large bowl of leftover Pancit.   (Wish I had read the reviews that said to break the noodles in half first! Anyway, I may take the leftover tomorrow for a church potluck lunch.  :)

I had only tried this once before and was excited to try it.  My only criticism is that although it tasted good, it was very bland.  Is there anything I can add, staying within the tradition, that would enhance the flavours?

I am very intimidated by asian dishes - but this Super easy and super yummy. Leftovers kept well in the fridge, too, and were great for lunch the following day.

It had good flavor, but it was very dry to me. I would have liked more of a sauce. I don't think I will make it again.

I only had two cloves of garlic, used bok choy instead of cabbage;  no other changes.  This was very easy to prepare and made a very tasty meal, with some leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for posting.

Probably entirely my fault--used Japanese noodles instead of rice noodles. They were very gummy, after soaking for 10 mins. Flavor was good and vegetables were excellent. Next time, I'll have to be sure to use rice noodles. :(

This was yummy. Easy peasy too!  I did add broccoli and mushrooms since I didn't use meat. I used white as well as green onion. I tossed in a handful of chopped cilantro.  This went well with the adobo pork, store bought lumpia and coconut jelly fruit salad I made. Delish!! Thanks Heather.

I love Pancit, but haven't had it in years. This was delicious! I did cut back to 3 carrots and added 1 stalk of celery. I really liked it topped with Sriracha hot sauce on my plate because I like a little heat. I will definitely make this again.

I have never cooked anything with rice noodles before. This was delicious. Would be great with some kind of sweet/tangy spicy sauce, but I'm not sure what.

This recipe is so easy.  Instead of slicing the cabbage, I chop it super fine.  I also added a small amount of green curry paste to give it a little more flavor.  With the curry paste included, the lemon wasn't as necessary.

My husband picked up some Canton-style noodles, and I used this recipe as a guide for our meal.  We used what we had on-hand - shitaake mushrooms, cabbage, onion. garlic and Hawaiian chili peppers from our garden. We were short on veggies, so I used 2 cups of a frozen stir-fry medley of red bell pepper & carrot strips, water chestnuts, sugar snap peas, broccoli. celery and green beans. A note, we added 2 cups of broth to the sauteed veggies, brought to a boil, added shoyu (soy sauce), some sesame oil, oyster sauce, then stirred in the noodles & frozen veg and let the noodles absorb the liquid as the veggies cooked. We have lots of green onions in our garden - they are terrific to top the dish, for sure. We have lime trees, so we used lime instead of lemon - a few squeezes really made the dish! We marinated some pork ribs in a char-siu rub and BBQ'd those until nice & crispy on the edges and served that on the side. My husband gives this a 4, I give this a 5. I just finished it for breakfast - fabulous!

I followed the recipe to the letter, prep time was longer than 20 minutes, but I used chicken that I had to cook and cut up too. My wife and I both agreed it lacked flavor. She is dieting and if she is gonna eat something that is 9 points, it better have some flavor. I even added extra garlic, and it was still bland. I will look for another pancit recipe, sorry but this one did not work out for me.

Not our thing. The flavor was pretty good, but we didn't care much for the noodles. They soaked all the juices up and made the entire dish dry. Should have added some sort of broth, but was worried about the saltiness. I might make this again but use angel hair pasta instead of the rice noodles.

Excellent dish and easy to tweak! Very easy and healthy. I added sliced portabello mushrooms and it was great served with white rice. I will definitely make this again, it makes enough to serve an army and reheats well for yummy leftovers days afterwards.

I used broccoli slaw(that's all I could find) I used the rice noodles and chopped them up a bit.  DO NOT over soak the noodles as it will be mushy. I did the recipe as but I added a wee bit of white pepper and squeezed lemon juice on afterwards. VERY yummy!

I had never made pancit so I thought I would give it a try. I think that 12 ounces of rice noodles was way too much. Next time I will reduce that to maybe 8 ounces  I also added shrimp to mine. It was very flavorful.

I split this recipe into two, sorta.  I cooked up the meat, I used the recommended chicken plus shrimp, on request from my hubby (who is Filipino). Removed them from the skillet.  Cooked up the veggies as directed, added the soy sauce and the noodles and cooked it up. Because I was making this for a party that consisted of vegetarians and people allergic to shrimp, I split the noodles into two, one without the meat and another with the meats placed on top with the lemon wedges.  I got rave reviews from my husbands family.  Very authentic and they were surprised I made it.  I can make lumpia, adobo and now, Pancit with the best of them! Thanks for this "Quick & Easy" recipe!

Surprisingly good.  I, too thought this would be bland.  Althought there are not a lot of spices/herbs in this recipe, the combination of all the flavors combine wonderfully and not one taste overpowers the others.  Great cold the next day!

Growing up, I called my mom's pancit panshi... anyway, you get the picture.. i never liked the stuff.. until now. I made this recipe for my mom and she is a convert. She actually made this the other day and almost cried because it's the first time in 20 years i've eaten pancit she has made. Thanks Heather!

I must say this dish went over very well with everyone tonight (1 & 2 year old included).  Even with soy sauce being the only "spice" listed, it was still a "better than good" dish.  (I used a light soy sauce) The quiet tone this dish possessed didn't surprise me because I normally look before I leap.   We like to appreciate the natural flavors these certain vegetables have to offer anyhow.  Consider this recipe apart of our Cabbage Collection.  Thanks!

Thought this was just ok although the noodles I used were a bit dry which is not probably how they usually turn out. I think I'm just not that pushed on cabbage/carrot.

This recipe is good, but it taste like its missing something.  Also, the noodles were a little bit hard so I added a little bit of chicken stock after I combined the noodles with the rest of the ingredients, and cooked it just a little a few minutes longer.

I love Pancit! This was an easy and fun meal to make. For anyone who doesn't know....rice noodles are almost impossible to separate so PLEASE do not try to separate the package like I did. Just make the whole 6 servings, you'll be wanting it for lunch the next day and it will shorten kitchen cleanup trying to sweep up all those little clear noodles.....;)

I thought that this was awesome!!  I worked in a plant with a lot of filipino ladies and they would always bring Pancit to the potlucks.  This was dead on.  My husband and kids were not keen on the texture of the noodle, but I did find a lager rice noodle that I will try next time to appease their taste.  Otherwise the flavor was great and this is a keeper.  check out my photo.

Love this.  I grew around a large Filipino community and this is just like I remember from all the potlucks.  Easily one of my favorite dishes of all time. Even my super picky husband makes no complaints.

This is a great starting point for chinese food. I added 1/8 ginger powder, 1/8 garlic powder, 2 tablespoons of veg oil, 1/2 cup soy sauce, a dash of worchestershire sauce, 3 celery stalks, and 1 package of mushrooms. I will use less noodles next time. EXCELLENT!!!

This is pretty good, but it was missing a little something IMO. It tasted much better the next day. I used shrimp and it turned out pretty good.

Our family really enjoys this easy to make dinner. The first time I made it it wasn't very flavorful, we added a bit of spice to it and loved it! But I as a mom love the dish because it is so easy to make. I finally found the right rice noodles!!! Makes me so happy!

So-so. Not bad, not great. My friends from Guam made a dish they called Pancit. This is not it. Again I must stress, this is not bad. Different island, different ingredients.

Very tasty! My husband and I both found it needed more soy sauce. (that might be a matter of preference) I took one reviewer's idea and used a bag of coleslaw mix instead of cutting up a whole cabbage. This made it very quick. I did need to add 2 carrots to the coleslaw mix as there was very little carrot in it. Make sure to soak the noodles long enough and check that there are no hard clumps remaining. I would suggest adding more vegetables. I think that sweet red pepper and mushrooms would be a great addition - added with the onions and garlic at the beginning. I will definitely make this again!

We really enjoyed this.  I used an 8 ounce package of noodles because it's what I had on hand and I thought the amount of noodles was perfect.  And I did end up boiling the noodles until they were soft so my toddler wouldn't have a hard time eating it.  We used sauted tofu instead of chicken and I did end up adding 1c. of broth and another few splashes of soy sauce as we like our pancit on the soupy side.  A sprinkle of green onions is a nice addition as well.

I just made this because my Filipina friend had brought it into work one day and I really liked it. Anyway she got me the noodles including "shiny noodles". I soaked these in warm water until soft and sauteed all the veggies in soy sauce. She told me to add celery to this and a fried egg which I did and it came out great! I added garlic powder instead of garlic because I had no garlic on hand(I really need to go shopping!). Next time I will add shrimp per my hubby. I made it a vegetarian dish this time only for 1 person and it made alot because I used a small amount of noodles but those babies really expand!!! Enjoy this recipe....it is a keeper!

This pancit recipe is so delicious and authentic! I don't find it to be a quick recipe, as there's a lot of fine chopping to do to get the right mix of ingredients. My filipino kids were thrilled with this and it will be a regular in our house!

I liked this, but my husband could not stop raving about it.  I added a little of my extra touches while cooking, but I will definitely add this recipe into my regular routine!  (I added ginger, red pepper flakes to taste, and made scrambled eggs to add in if they wanted, and everyone did!)

EXCELLENT!
I sent the recipe to my Filipina friend and she said it's really close to how her Grandmother makes it so I gave it a try.

I did make a few slight changes per other reviewers. My kids really dislike rice noodles, so we just used Asian noddles. I also used 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 canola oil; green onions for the onions (since I was already cutting it up to make lumpia)and added a little bit of chicken broth(didn't measure, just eye-balled it) so it was a little more wet and not so sticky. I think I also doubled the garlic, but that's only because we REALLY like garlic here!

Very easy and flavorful recipe! This will definately go in my favorites box. My husband and children gobbled it up and raved about it! The only thing I changed was I added more soy sauce. Two Tbl just didn't seem to cut it, so I recommend adding to taste. Next time I think I will try this same recipe with teryaki sauce.Mmmmm!

I've made this recipe several times and enjoyed it but never really cared for the texture of the rice noodles. Last night I tried using Ramen noodles (2 pkgs) instead, and it turned out great. So for those who don't like rice noodles or are having trouble with them, I think Ramen noodles are a good alternative.

I am not a cooker by any means but I absolutely love this receipe!!!  It was so great and very easy.  I exchanged pork and baby shrimp for the chicken and it turned out just as good. If you are looking for a great Pancit receipe this is definitely it.....even my picky eater boyfriend liked it!!

My SIL is famous for her pancit and I thought this came incredibly close. I couldn't find pancit noodles and we don't care for the rice noodles, so I just grabbed a few packages of Ramen. I too added sesame oil, more seasonings and also threw in some broccoli. You're right Heather, this is certainly a quick dinner, not to mention absolutely delicious. Thanks!

I liked all the veggies and made it without meat, but the noodles themselves did not have much flavor.  Next time, I may add spicy sesame oil and more soy sauce so that there's more for the noodles to soak up.

Delicious, but they do take a while to assemble and end up a little greasy.

this recipes was good, but i think there was too much oinoin in it (it was perrty big)  i think it might be better with more chicken.  In the phillipens, we always garnished with lime instead of lemon.  Overall ws very authenric.

This is my second time making it and it's so good! The mixture of soy sauce, garlic, onion and lemon juice are what make the dish. It only needed a sprinkle of salt to make the taste pop. I just used green onion and shrimp. I'll never have to order takeout noodles again!

I reduced the noodles to 8oz (used the thinnest rice noodles), the cabbage to about 3/4 of a head, increased the chicken to 3 cups total and left the quantities of everything else the same.  I also added a healthy amount of ground fresh chili paste.  As others have noted, this is a really flexible recipe.  It's so good and easy it's on the menu a couple of times each month.

We added chopped red and green peppers to saute with the onions in olive oil, along with a splash of sesame oil.  Soaked the broken rice noodles for over an hour to soften.  For simplicity, we shredded the carrots in a food processor.  We purchased 1 bag fresh coleslaw mix from the Produce department so we wouldn't have to slice  the cabbage.  We used chopped garlic from a jar, along with additionally adding some oyster and hoisin sauces.  Added cracked blacked pepper at the end and omitted the lemons (hubby doesn't like).  Next time, I think I'll buy a Costco rotisserie chicken and debone to save some work.

It is good, but a bit dry. As someone already noted in the previous reviews, stock is missing. Also added bell pepper which made it simply amazing.

This very basic recipe is easy & tasty.  Here's my spin on it to save time & make it even a bit better.  I don't cut up carrots & cabbage- Buy a bag of coleslaw from the produce section of the grocery store.  It's the same thing but already thinly cut for you.  When getting your noodles pick up a bottle of fish sauce. A few squirts of this will add a yummy flavor to the dish.  Serve with soy sauce & lemon or lime wedges.  Enjoy!

Well I made my first attempt to make pancit. I think something was missing, it looked great but was tasting a little bland, my daughter works with some phillpinos and has had their pancit. She added a little hoisin sauce and now it taste great.

Aptly named. Very quick, very easy. Prep time is where all the work is. I exclude onions, except green onions as a garnish. I also pre-cook and hand-shred the chicken. I save the broth to add later to prevent the noodles from drying out. I also recommend sprinkling dried garlic on top. My credo is you can never have too much garlic. It's my wife's favorite and she has several of her friends asking me to make it for them. It's the closest I've come to my late Mom's version.

It turned out great and it was delicious. I sautéed the onion and garlic with the chicken, and then separately again with the carrots and snow peas, and then again with the cabbage all separately just to get the whole flavor set into them.

This turned out awesome, even my Filipino wife loved it and her Mom and Dad both make excellent pacit!  This does make a bunch, plenty for a gathering or for several meals.  I did make few adjustments to the recipe:

Only needed two carrots and half an onion (was a larger medium sized one), also got a head of cabbage about softball size and only needed about 2/3rds of it.  Added thinly sliced celery, green onions and salad shrimp too.

I ended up boiling the chicken first and then cut it up.   Boiled water with about a cup of chicken broth in it then removed it from the heat and put the noodles in it.  Definitely break the noodles up so they aren't super long.

Used more like 1/3 of a cup of soy sauce and sauteed everything but the meat together at the same time til softened a bit and then added the chicken and maybe a 1/4 to 1/3 cup more soy sauce and cooked a few more minutes then added the noodles and stirred/cooked until heated and all noodles were coated in the soy sauce.

Family loves Pancit!
Although, I didn't how much water to use when boiling the noodles...kept adding water at 1/2 cup increments. 
But overall, it turned out great and will continue to make this dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love Pancit because you can change it up however you like it. I use packaged shredded cabbage and carrots, broccoli florets, and sometimes add snow peas during the last couple of minutes. Soaking  the rice noodles is much easier than sautéing them. And this time I added a package of small, frozen and thawed shrimp instead of chicken since I was serving it with Chicken Adobo.

The only change is that I added a tad bit more (to taste) of Soy Sauce. I also added  2 fried eggs to my batch.  (I fried it separately at the very end and added it evenly to the finished pancit. This was quick, easy and a huge amount for my family of 6! Thank You for this recipe!!!

This beats ANY that my family or I have ever had at any restaurant! PERIOD!
Our local Chinese restaurants call this dish Lo Mein, which we absolutely love.
The only change I made was leaving the chicken out because we ate a shrimp dinner with it.
Recipe is perfect as is.
We could eat this several times per week!

Great recipe! This was my first time making this, and I had trouble figuring out what kind of rice noodles to buy. I ended up with a bag if "stir-fry" noodles. I wasn't sure about soaking them in hot water, because the bag instructions were to boil in water for 12-14 minutes. So, I boiled them, drained them and added them at the end. They are good, but I was hoping for a very small thin noodle....better luck next time. It ended up being GREAT! I made this as a side dish with chicken adobo. Happy family and clean plates! Happy Momma.

This was really not good. There was almost no flavor to this dish, and no matter what I did to try to rescue it with seasonings and soy sauce, it just wasn't going to cut it. Unfortunately this was a waste, as it all went into the trash.

I'd like to say "I made it"....and I did, kinda, but I made soooo many substitutions I'm not sure I can in all honesty stay I made it.  BUT, I used this recipe as a guideline and it turned out el yummo.  I basically emptied the leftover vegetable drawer - zucchini, carrots, green beans, mushrooms, onion etc.  I chucked in leftover chicken.  I used vermicelli (see what I mean about the myriad of substitutions?) as that's what I had.  Anyway, it turned out delicious.  It made a huge amount - easily enough for 4-5 hungry people, and was extremely economical to make.  I would say about $1 per person at the outside.  
The DH and I like things spicy so we chucked some hot sauce on there rather than extra soy sauce.  Nom nom nom.

I made this for a potluck at work, and it was a huge hit and super easy to make! The only thing I did differently was add a little chicken broth when I added the noodles just to keep them from getting too dry. My rice noodles were impossible to break up prior to cooking so I just chopped them up with some kitchen shears once they were soft. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe easy and tasted just ok... not very flavorful.  Would use again with the following changes:
Would soak the rice noodles in heated chicken broth rather than water.  Would also use peanut oil rather than veggie oil.  Gives it more asian flavor.

Been missing my pancit fix since I moved out of San Francisco and away from my Filipino friends. Made this to take  to a pot luck tomorrow.  I will let you know how it goes.  I have had two servings myself.  I'd say it is absolutely a 5.

This is a great dish. Instead of the special noodles, I used a cheap pack of ramen noodles. I cooked them until loosened then added some oil to get a little crisp on them. The rest I did exactly the same as posted. Will be adding this one to the rotation.

I have always been scared to attempt pancit but this recipe was super easy and delicious! I had to go to a local oriental market to find bihon rice noodles. I filled a large plastic container with warm, on the cusp of hot, water from my tap and covered it with a cloth towel. I checked it in ten minutes and they were good to go! I drained them and set them aside. I don't like using canned chicken so I bought 1.5lbs of chicken breast, cut it into cubes, sautéed it and then set it aside to be added with the noodles. I cooked the garlic and onion in the chicken drippings. A lot of other reviews said green onion but I went with a small diced yellow and it was great. I also added snow peas and water chestnuts (drained of course) because I love them. They all cooked really evenly and added great texture. I am a huge fan of Bragg's Liquid Aminos as a soy sauce substitute but it would have made it WAY too salty so I used Yamasa brand soy sauce. I put in 1c of soy sauce total instead of the suggested 1/4c. I started with 1/4 but it seemed too dry. After everything was mixed in and served up I grabbed my bowl and put a few drops of sriracha in. It gave the dish a little kick.  This is definitely an easy, wonderful base recipe! Will make again.

I'm more of a fan of pancit Canton vice bihon rice noodles. I use the Orchids brand 'Philippine Style Noodles'. Whether with pork or chicken, this recipe is fast and easy. I don't soak the noodles but add them at the end and let the rising steam soften them.

Taste good and love the noodles. I used Nappa Cabbage and Costco Chicken to the dish with green onions to garnish. I found it a little more tasty this way. Hope that's ok ?? thanks for sharing

This was a very good basic pancit recipe. I used half kikkoman soysauce and half vietnamese fish sauce (which is what my ninang does). My husband loved it! I also used steak instead of chicken which added more flavor than chicken as the steak juices were absorbed by the noodles. I didn't have cabbage so I just used onions and carrots. Next time I will add cabbage and green onions. I used the vermicelli rice noodles (I have a lot left over from when I made vietnamese food). You HAVE to soak it in  warm/hot faucet water for at least 15 minutes. It was not al dente at all as it softened when it absorbed the cooking juices. If your noodles were still firm then your noodles weren't good. I haven't cooked pancit by myself ever and I think I did a wonderful job because of this recipe :)

Yummy! I was a little nervous in making it for the first time because I didn't want to be disappointed. But my family loved it! Definitely making this again.

This was a huge hit with my family....thank you for sharing this recipe! I skipped the chicken and served grilled pork on the side with some spring rolls. I will definitely be making this again:-)

Being a Filipina and all, this dish is very similar to how my mom made it, but she used pork. I used sliced bacon,  steak pieces, and 5 cloves of garlic. I love the taste of garlic and it was wonderful for supper tonight. My husband loved it very much. Nothing beats Homeade Filipino food! :)

Easy to make and tasty.  I did add mushroom bouillon  and a dash of pepper and oyster sauce for more flavor. I couldn't find the good rice noodles so it went a bit dry.

Very bland and dry.  It has potential but it needs a bit more oil, some ginger - something to give it some flavor and moisture. Not making again.

I don't usually leave reviews in general, but, it isn't often I find a recipe that both of my daughters will eat!  I'm the mom making two dinners every night because they can't agree (I know, my fault).  

This was absolutely delicious!  The only thing I changed was I used about 9 - yes 9 - cloves of garlic and I added a couple of sliced green onions.   I used shrimp since I don't eat meat and it was wonderful.   

I will definitely be making this again!

Followed the recipe, but since I had 16oz of bihon noodles, I added another 1/4 of soy sauce, making it 1/2 cup of soy sauce total. I also added a little bit of salt, pepper, and garlic powder after I mixed all the ingredients together. Turned out really good!!

It was quick and easy like it said but I have to say I added more salt  / fish sauce to it. The flavor with just the soy sauce just wasn't enough. But overall it was great!

my first time making pancit! I added about total of 1/2c soy sauce and half a head of small cabbage. I added about a few dashes of fish sauce, salt and pepper too!! when I threw in the noodles, it seemed a bit too watery so I had to cook the noodles over low heat for about 15min for the liquid to reduce and noodles to be tender, but overall it was easier than I thought it would be!!! yum!!

Authentic. Make sure to use well-seasoned chicken in this dish. I used leftover roast chicken and it was perfect.

This was a very easy recipe! The only thing was that I bought a package of rice noodles that was 6.75 oz. So, I used 2 packages and it was way too many noodles! The one package would have been perfect. But, I just made some more carrots and cabbage and it worked out fine. Yum!

This was amazing. My boyfriend is filipino and i wanted to make an authentic dish for him and when he seen what i was making, he began to tell me about how his mom made it...the pressure was on. i was worried...authentic versus my duplication. i was worried...but he loved it...it came out great and he pretty much had 2 plates and took it to work for lunch. Thank you so much for sharing!!! :)

Just finished making this dish, and eating some right now. Yummy. The only change I made was to use a bag of pre-shredded cabbage. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make this again.

Thanks Heather for this quick, easy and tasty recipe.

I don't know if I didn't wait long enough for the noodles to soak or what but this wasn't as good as I had hoped.  I didn't put in the chicken as I was making this as a side dish to go with lumpia.  My husband said the texture of the noodles he couldn't get past but had a good flavor.  I thought the flavor was a little to bland.  The only flavoring was the garlic and soy sauce.  I even added more soy sauce than recommended.  I need someone who knows how to make pancit so I can taste it again and see if it was just me making it wrong or I just don't like pancit.  I thought I had it before and loved it but if this is what it is suppose to taste like then I don't think I do.

Edible, but missing flavor and too sticky and dry with just a 1/4 of soy sauce and lemon wedges.  Has potential but needs tweaking.  I think it would be excellent with a peanut sauce of some kind.

In our house, we use chicken broth to add some more flavor for the noodles.  Also some shrimp and other veggies (red bell pepper, celery, etc.) may make an appearance, depending on what's in the refrigerator.

This was just OK. We were not a huge fan, and I would not make again. When I told my Filipina friend I had attempted to make pancit, and showed her this recipe, she laughed. Her family recipe that I had previously fallen in love with includes shrimp, pork shoulder, green beans, shiitake mushrooms, patis (Filipino fish sauce), and Chinese wheat noodles, so there are many differences. While this was meant to be a 'quick and easy' version, the next time I want pancit I will just call her.

Overall, I felt like this was uninspiring. Was it true to it's name? yes, it was quick and easy. And it was good. But just...missing that something extra.

I had dinner guests tonight and made this recipe.  I can't believe there is none left!  Everyone raved about it and had seconds and thirds.  I made it exactly as described, it was exactly what I remembered and tasted just as good as my friend's mother's recipe.  Thank you for a great recipe and a wonderful dinner!  Will be making this a household staple!

Even with the addition of a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, I found this to be a bit bland. However, my pickly teenager daughter liked it very much, which I am grateful for.

Fantastic!!!!  My noodles were really sticky and tough to stir into the veggies so I added a ladle of hot water and that helped a lot.  Also added a little extra soy sauce when I served it.  The lemon made the dish even better.  I added cashews instead of chicken - DELICIOUS!!!

The flavor was just "meh" for me...I normally like flavors with more complexity and I should have known better than to try a recipe when the only real seasoning was soy sauce. I don't think I'll try it again.

Followed this recipe perfectly but I didn't really like it. There just wasn't much flavor. After a few bites I added a ladel of patis and a bit more soy sauce. This definitely isn't what I grew up with but with the modifications it turned out edible.

Really good!  I added some chopped (VERY roughly) shrimp & mushrooms.  I use a package of tricolored coleslaw mix & also grated in some extra carrot.  My 16 month old even loved it and kept asking for seconds - although it was messy for him. I was planning on making eggs rolls to go with it but there was so much, even when I halved the recipe that I decided not to.  Even better the next day and would be perfect to take to work for a luncheon because it would feed a crowd!

I don't know what I did wrong, but this did not turn out anything like the Pancit that I had at a friends house.  In fact it was so bad, I had to throw the entire wok full of food out.  Boy, was I sad. :(  Won't make again.

This recipe is too dry as is and lacked zing.  So I mixed an additional 1/4 c. tamari with about 1 cup broth and 1/3 cup lemon juice.  Divide that evenly between the noodles and the veggie-meat mixture.  I think those modifications helped greatly.

My husband and girls really loved this.  At first I thought I had put too much cabbage - my wok was piled high, but with a bit of cooking I had room for the noodles.  Wonderful, simple, delicious meal.  Thank you!

I don't know how this got such a high rating. I made exactly as directed and it was very bland. Maybe it was my soya sauce? -But I use it for every other recipe and love it so I doubt it. It needs some sort of spice added. We mixed in some hoisin sauce and cayenne to give it enough so that we could finish it. (But that turned it into more asian than filipino)

Mmmm, comfort food.  Reminds me of family parties.  A great start to learning to make traditional dishes for my family.  My husband and I are trying to accustom filipino dishes to our kids.  Kinda hard when mommy and daddy don't know how to cook it and when we visit grandma she just takes us out to eat.

Now this one tastes like should! OK, I also added some more soy, but it took me back to my visit to the Philippeans. I used chicken and shrimp, Thai rice noodles and it was awesome!  It almost makes up for the nasty adobo recipe!

My children LOVED this & gave it 5 stars.  I gave it 4 because I thought it lacked a bit in flavor.  We will be making this again with a few tweeks. Otherwise- it is a great base recipe! Thanks!

I have never had pancit or any other Filopino food before, so my comments should be directed to others that are being adventurous, not people familar with the dish. I followed the recipe exactly using rice sticks (which was the closest I could find to the right noodle). I think that mushrooms would have been a nice addition. It was really easy to make and had good flavor (I used reduced sodium soy sauce), but not as filling as I would have liked. It reminded me of lo mein with rice noodles. I ended up using half of a small head of cabbage and that seemed to be plenty. I thought that it was too much until adding the noodles, then it seemed like an appropriate amount. This is a good dish to try, but it won't be making it onto my family's list of favorites.

I've never heard of pancit, but decided to make this when I had a leftover head of cabbage to use.  It's delicious, and next time I'll definitely add a bit water as some reviewers suggested.  Beware - this makes A LOT.  I would definitely halve it next time so I don't have five days of leftovers!  The only substitution I made was using tofu instead of chicken - a great vegan meal.

The recipe was just like it said, quick and easy.  The noodles were great and the family loved it.  My wife lived in the Philippines so she usually makes this but now I cna make and I do not have to wait for her.

Very tasty dish! I have used pancit noodles instead of the rice noodles. Both are good. I also add pork and even some shrimp if we have them. After adding the soy sauce, I like to add 2 cups of chicken broth. Bring to a boil then add 1 cup thinly sliced cabbage and other vegetables. Cook until veggies are tender yet crisp (5 min) Add the noodles and mix gently until liquid is absorbed. Season with a little fish sauce to add flavor!

Very tasty.
I substituted sesame oil, and added some red pepper flakes to the onion and garlic, then a little hot chili oil at the end with the soy sauce.

4 stars-only because I changed it a little.  I used what I had on hand:  red cabbage instead of green, whole grain spaghetti (1/2 box) instead of rice noodles, grated my carrots, used 3 cooked chicken breast halves, shredded, and lemon juice (1 tbsp) instead of wedges and I opted to add a few dashes of sesame oil and ground ginger.  Probably not tradtional pancit, but still delicious.

This was a very good recipe that even my picky eater liked.  I only used half the amount of noodles which was plenty enough for the dish and also used 1/2 c. of teriyaki sauce instead of the soy sauce.  Thanks for a quick and easy meal!

Wow! So easy and delicious! I used bean threads instead of rice noodles and it turned out great. Didn't add any meat because I made marinated pork shish kabobs and pork egg rolls with it. Instead, I bulked up on veggies by adding sliced peapods and more carrots. Added extra soy sauce also. Oh, so good and it makes a TON! I could split the recipe in half and still serve 6.

We just had this for dinner tonight and it was terrific!  Tasted authentic--don't skip the lemon on top.  The ingredients, including the 12 ounce bag of noodles, made far more than 6 servings.

Possibly I did something wrong. I've never had traditional Pancit so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like. My veggies and chicken were fine, and the sauce was tasty (I added some hoisin sauce). However, 12 oz of rice noodles (which is two packages - I couldn't find a 12 oz package) was WAY too much. It drowned the meat and veggies completely. I'll definately try this again, but with only half the noodles.

SO I thought this was very good. It didnt quite taste like the pancit made by my philipino friends mother. It may have had to do with the noodles though. THey were a little different than I remember. I got rice noodles but have heard from other users to get the ones that say they are for pancit. Anyway, I enjoyed this. WOuld be really good with Shrimp!

Very good and basic recipe. You could add a little chicken broth to it and some lemon juice for extra moisture and flavor.

I cooked it for  my hubby, who is Filippino, right now he is inhaling the third helping! It really is quick and easy. And delicious! I did not have cabbage, but used thinly slised celery, and also added asian fish balls and some cooked salad shrimp. Served with lemon juice, instead of lemons

this is so easy.  I think I may have put too many noodles in.  I used the vermicelli because it's all I had in the pantry and it turned out delicious.  My filipino husband loved it.

Mmmm...tasted like my friend's mom's pancit...she moved back to the Phillippines so I had to learn how to make it myself.  The title doesn't lie...it was quick and easy and most importantly, DELICIOUS!

My mother in law uses angel hair pasta for this sometimes, it's really good! The best thing about pancit is that you can add or omit whatever you want.

easy recipe to make!!  It was very tasty.  Instead of soy sauce, all I had was a chinese chicken salad dressing. MAN OH MAN it was good...probably not authentic but very tasty.

This was just okay, kind of one-dimensional.  It was missing something, I just couldn't figure out what.  Since it's pretty healthy, though, I may try again with other reviewers' modifications.

I don't very often rate things poorly, so this is a first. My husband and I did not like this at all! It was very bland and dry. We ended up just picking the chicken out of it to eat. Maybe I messed it up some how, but I followed the directions perfectly. I don't recommend it at all. Use your ingredients on a more worthy dish.

I loved this!  It was even better as left-overs.  The rest of my family wasn't crazy about it, though.
