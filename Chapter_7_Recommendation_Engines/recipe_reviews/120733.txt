OH MY GOODNESS!!! I've gotten a lot of different recipes off of different sites that weren't too tasty, but this one was REALLY GOOD!!!  I didnt have any vinegar to add, and I used only chicken breasts but it was still to die for.  My husband even packed his own lunch last night so I wouldn't get the left overs for myself.

This is a good recipe, but sweet as others mentioned. Not too sweet but still sweet. I recommend covering the baking pan with foil paper before baking. Unless you wanna have a big black mess!

This recipe has been in my recipe box forever and I finally decided to try it.  Boy do I wish I would have tried it sooner!  So very tasty!  Sweet, but not overly sweet, finger licking good!  I doubled the sauce, marinated overnight and baked for 1 hour and 30 mins ( I like my chicken on the crispy side) with basting.  The only thing I did different was to rub chicken with olive oil and Mrs Dash before pouring sauce on chicken.  Came out very moist and flavorful.  My picky 17 year old liked this.  To me this tastes better than regular bbq chicken.

This was really, really good!  Similiar to a bbq chicken.  The sauce is very similiar to the bbq my mom makes for her ribs.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding all the spices  when I made the sauce.  Couldn't figure out why you would need to wait to add the spices.  Also I seasoned my chicken very well with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I also did not chop the onion, but sliced it on top of the chicken.  It was yummy.  Even my picky eater thought it was good!  Thanks for the recipe....This is a keeper!

The aroma of this chicken baking was amazing. The taste of it wasn't as fantastic as it smelled, but it was good. I found it to need more spices. I think it should have garlic and more salt and other spices.. I am willing to explore that the next time I make it. This dish is worth making, my family enjoyed it. I made up the sauce ahead of time and had the chicken marinating in it over night.

This was ok but not great. I was expecting a thicker sauce, but mine was runny.  The kids didn't even finish theirs, and they usually do.  It was kind of like tomato-y, light bbq sauce.

This recipe was really great!  My stepson (who eats nothing) loved it!  I made a couple of changes after reading all the other reviews:  I covered the chicken in lemon juice while preparing the tangy sauce.  When I took the dish out of the fridge to sit for 30 minutes, I sprinkled garlic salt on top.  It helped balance the sweetness that so many others complained of. This is one recipe to add to my recipe box!

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe it was a lot like BBQ sauce but not as good. I cooked 4 large chicken breasts and had to keep it in the oven for about 1 hour.

Made this last night.  Yummy!  I did make some changes to make it gluten free.  Used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and used corn starch instead of flour.  I only let it set for an hour or so.  Next time I'll let it sit in the fridge for several hours before baking.  Hubby loved and and said he can't wait to have the left overs for lunch today!

What made this recipe 5 star for me was that it did NOT taste just like chicken baked in BBQ sauce from a bottle.  You could really tell that the sauce was made from scratch.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which were marinated in the sauce about 15 hours before baking.  Moist and delicious.

We really enjoyed this one.  I marinated for probably 4 hours and I did have to bake longer than listed, but it seems I always have to bake longer than the recipes call for, so I was prepared for that.  I also covered for a bit first which really thinned down my beautiful sauce but it was still very tasty.  I will definitely keep this one in the rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is great. With the original version all I added was some crushed garlic and I rubbed the chicken with some melted better before pouring the sauce over the chicken. Recently I made a batch of wings and used this sauce. Just browned some wings in olive oil then threw them in a slow cooker with the sauce.

This was one of the best chicken dishes I have made.  I did have not have the worcestershire sauce so I replaced that with two tablespoons of thick and bold steak sauce and one teaspoon of liquid smoke instead.  Since my husband does not like spicy foods i did not add the chili powder but will definietly make again.. alittle sweet but that is ok.  thanks for the recipe!!

Actually, it's more like a 4.5.  This was really good--I think it could be better if I'd used more spices like other reviewers suggested.  I used four boneless skinless chicken breasts and baked them for 40 minutes.  Everything came together nicely.

This was pretty good, after i altered it quiet a bit. others said it was too sweet so i only put 2 tablespoons of sugar, i added a clove of garlic, insted of 3tbsp of vinegar i put 1tbsp of balsamic vinegar and i didn't have paperika so i put in a tbsp of salt free seasoning(basicly salt free seasoning salt)and i put the garlic, half the onion, and half the sauce in a blender then mixed it back all together. after that my whole family liked it, i thought it could have been more spicy.

This is a great recipe.  The chicken turned out juicy and tender.  I did have to cook it for 50-55 min. My husband thought it was too sweet so maybe I'll cut back on the brown sugar next time.

This was a huge hit tonight.  After dinner my husband made toast to mop up the sauce on his plate.  Even my 3 year old -- known for being picky ate every bite!  And the leftover sauce is great on rice too.

As a note I used two chicken breasts and didn't bother cooking the sauce (to thicken it) as per the earlier steps.  I just beat the flour and water, added all the other ingredients, diced the chicken breasts and poured everything together in the cooking dish.

I was really hoping for a better taste.  I followed the recipe exactly - didn't make any changes at all.  It was just okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  It's not a recipe I'll make again.

This was quite tasty. I used barbeque sauce instead of ketchup (I had barbeque on hand and no ketchup) and I added just a touch of Liquid Smoke. Very simple and fast. Used on hand ingredients that I have to use anyhow (we're moving shortly and cannot take condiments with us) and with a package of chicken legs, this was easy on the budget, too. Next time, I might add a little garlic/onion powders.

DELICIOUS!!!  Made a couple alterations based on what I had on hand.  I had no flour so I omitted it and the water and doubled the rest of the ingredients.  I only had time to marinate for about 30 miutes.  Baked at 375 for around 55 minutes while baking my potatoes separately.  Turned out great!!

Loved it! I omitted the lemon juice (I'm allergic) and added extra vinegar...the trick IS cooking the marinade/sauce! Since the breasts were huge skin-on, bone-in breasts I cooked them a little longer for tenderness. I LOVE the flavor of the little crisped onions with the sweet and tangy sauce, this is going in my recipe box and WILL be used again.

everyone liked.  used boneless chicken tenders, marinated in buttermilk and lemon for an hour, then coated with cracker crumbs.   baked uncovered at 400 for 10 minutes, then covered at 375 for about another 10.  5 more minutes uncovered.  Good sauce, thanks!

5 Star for simplicity/taste. A nice all around pleaser. Perfect spice/sweet ratio for everyone at the table.

This is a delightfully tangy barbecue-esque sauce! I did the same as a few other reviewers and added the spices while cooking the sauce, instead of after, and reserved the onion to top the chicken before baking. I also only had tarragon white wine vinegar, but I really like the added complexity it gave. Finger-licking good!

This was delicious and I loved being able to fix it ahead of time and just pop it in the oven when I was ready.

This was great,the only thing I did different was I put it into a large zip lock bag in the fridge for 1 hour and baked it for 1 hour. It was wonderful..
