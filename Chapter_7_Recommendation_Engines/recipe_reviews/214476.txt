I cut this down to one serving to give it a try and WOW - great stuff!  It definitely is a nice combination of sweet and heat. Next time I might cut down on the paprika or use smoked paprika for a sweet 'n' smokey version.  Although this is meant as a rub I think next time I'll add this to burger meat to punch up regular old burgers - adding about 1 Tbsp. of this for every 1lb. of burger meat.  Thanks for the great recipe FTFF! UPDATE: I just couldn't resist trying this with hamburgers so my husband and I made some for lunch and OMG this stuff works wonders!  I used a Tbsp. and a half for a little over a pound of ground beef. The burgers came out sensational - moist, juicy with just the right amount of spiciness.  We had them on toasted rolls and they really didn't even need anything more than that.  These are definitely going on our list of things to make for our annual July 4th bash!

There is nothing better than the combination of sweet and spicy. This rub had both in just the perfect proportions. Made and used with steaks on the grill. Got 5 stars from both the boyfriend AND the father. Needless to say, thanks for such a wonderful concoction!

My husband had made a similar rub before that he loved but was never able to find the recipe for again - he said this had to have been it!  He loves it and loves grilling with it...which makes me a happy woman!

This worked out really well. I cut this recipe in half and it still made a ton. I didn't have fresh-ground pepper mix so I used just fresh ground pepper. I used only 1 tbsp. of New Mexico chili powder and I cut the cayenne pepper down to 1 tsp. because I was feeding small kids as well as grownups. Three tbsp. of this mix was perfect for a whole family package of chicken legs. My husband BBQ'ed them and they turned out great. I know I altered it a bit but I had to for my kids. Still, good stuff!

We loved this!  It was delicious on chicken so we tried sprinkling it over burgers on the grill.  That was fantastic, too.   I can't wait to try it on ribs.

This is really good on fish, but I did not like it on my chicken or red meat.

Wow, this stuff is amazing! I only made one serving of the rub, which was the perfect amount to test it out on a family pack of chicken legs and thighs. Even so, I had to cut the amount of chili powder in half because the kind I have is the very hot kind, and too much heat wouldn't be good to serve to my son. Also used regular ground black pepper as I don't ever have a pepper mix. This would be great on the bbq for sure. I'll definitely try this with other meats too. Thanks!

This is very spicy! I chose to first cut the paprika by 1/3 (still too spicy) and double the brown sugar.  Still pretty hot which is usually not a problem for me.  The next time i used the rubbI added some cinnamon which added some depth to the flavor.  I think it still needs something, cumin maybe.  I may like it more on chicken rather than ribs.  Not a keeper for me, but you might like it if you want HOT.

Love that you can change the serving size as this is a Christmas staple in our Santa's workshop each year!
