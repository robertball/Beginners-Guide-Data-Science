Having read a lot of the previous reviews, I used 2 C. brown sugar, 3 C. confectioner's, and 1 C. peanut butter.  It was EXCELLENT.

I also used 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter and 3 cups powdered sugar, as suggested by other cooks.  After stirring the peanut butter into the brown sugar mixture, I poured it into my electric mixer and added the powdered sugar, beating until well blended, then pressed it into an 8"x8" dish and covered with plastic. It turned out delicious and creamy! Note: When boiling for 2 minutes, bring it to a "hard, rolling boil" before starting to time.

Apparently I did something wrong, although I followed the instructions EXACTLY!!  Everything was going fine in the saucepan, and then I poured it into the sugar as instructed.  I used my mixer to blend, the sugar incorporated well, but it never became "smooth", even after 5 minutes of beating.  It was just a bowl of pebbles basically.  I thought I'd go ahead and press it into the pan anyways to see what would happen.  Oh MAN!  What a disaster.  The butter FLOATED to the top!!  If I had put it in the fridge like that, there would have been a layer of hardened butter on top!!  Please someone tell me what happened!

Wonderful fudge!  This was my first attempt at fudge and it turned out perfectly.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  Hint: Line the pan with Saran Wrap before pouring in the fudge.  When the fudge has cooled, you can just pop it out of the pan and peel off the Saran Wrap.  This gives the fudge a smooth professional look and gives you no sticky pan to clean!

This is the best peanut butter fudge I have ever made and have been making it for several years.  The first time I tried it, I waited for a full rolling boil and it ended up too hard, so I start timing just as soon as I see small bubbles.  It turns out perfect every time.  I am a southern girl from the "boil and drop in cold water" school.  But, I have won numerous fudge contests with this recipe and will never go back to boiling and dropping.

A very easy fudge recipe.  Do make sure you mix the confectioners' sugar with an electric mixer, it makes it much easier.

This recipe is too, too sweet. It's intolerably sweet. Also, it's not peanut-buttery enough. I would use 2 cups of brown sugar and 3 cups of powder sugar at the most next time, and 1 cup of peanut butter.

This is great!  I've made it so many times and it is fool proof.  Everyone always loves it and thinks I'm a master chef!  Tip:  brown sugar and confectioners' sugar both measure out to be a 1 lb. box each.

I greased the 8 x 8-inch pan with butter then lined the pan with saran wrap to make clean-up and cutting easier.  I reduced brown sugar down to 2 cups, powdered sugar to 3 cups and I used 1 cup of Skippy’s creamy peanut butter. I used heavy whipping cream for the ½ cup of the milk called for in the recipe. I brought the butter, brown sugar and milk to a hard rolling boil. From the second I saw small bubbles break the surface I took it off the heat exactly two minutes afterwards and poured in the peanut butter and vanilla. I made sure to sift the confectioners' sugar to avoid any lumps then used an electric mixer to reach a smooth consistency. After about 2 minutes of mixing I noticed the peanut butter pulled away from the edge of the bowl and formed a smooth lump-free batter. I poured the peanut butter fudge into the lined 8x8 pan and chilled it. This fudge gave a smooth creamy professional look. I used the overlapping saran wrap to lift up the fudge and cut into bars. This is rich, super creamy and satisfying! I can taste the peanut butter flavor however, some might want a stronger peanut butter taste. I thought this was slightly too sweet for me but everyone thought this was fabulously-rich and creamy! This was easy to make and we all enjoyed this!

At first, I rated this recipe a 2 as it was written.  It was way too dry and tasted just like powdered sugar with a hint of peanut butter.  However, I made it again with 2 c. brown sugar, 3 c. powdered sugar, and 1.5 c. of peanut butter.  This time, it is delicious and creamy!

I am not sure what's gone wrong with this, but I've made fudge before and this hasn't turned out too well.  As I mixed it, it became quite crumbly in texture.  I added a few drops of evaporated milk at a time to salvage it.  It tastes wonderful, but I don't think it's going to set well.  Anyone with similar problems???

To avoid getting crumbly, or weird little balls to form, leave the milk out till it is room temperature. It does that because the cold milk solidifies the melted butter.

After reading many reviews, the first time I made this I started the 2 minute timer well before the rolling boil but after the first bubble. I also stirred it frequently, as per the directions. However, that was obviously NOT the way to do it, since mine also turned out to be a bowl full of pebbles, even after mixing the holy heck out of it with my kitchen aid for more than 5 minutes. So I tried again w/these changes: 1/ I DID NOT STIR THE MIXTURE during the 2 minutes, and 2/ began the 2 minute timer at the first bubble. It went totally against my grain because at the end of 2 mins. it was barely a rolling boil. However, I soldiered on and it turned out very  nice. And yes, the p. sugar lumps did beat out and it ended up very smooth. Not quite pourable, however, and I had to spoon it into my pan. I also used the suggestions made by many reviewers, reducing sugars and increasing peanut butter. It is still pretty darn sweet, but maybe when it's completely set and firm, the sweetness will dissipate somewhat. Also, the peanut butter taste is not very strong, but that's how I like it. Thinking about why some people couldn't successfully cook it for 2 minutes after the rolling boil, the only thing I could think of was the type of pot used and the stove top temperature. My pot is a very good, heavy stainless steel and I have a gas stove, so "medium heat" is pretty subjective. I hope this helps  you.

We once forgot to add the powdered sugar, so we made again as the recipe directed. Forget it! Leaving out the powdered sugar gave a BETTER peanut flavor, stayed creamy, and is preferred by all of us-- even my sweet-tooth hubby! Five stars with changes. So good, and not too sweet with 1 cup PB, and 2 cups brown sugar (2 1/4 cups = 1 pound). Using my Kitchenaid to whip the syrup into the peanut butter (whip until thickened but still pourable) gave it a melt-in-your-mouth texture. It seemed to taste even better the next day.

Like another reviewer, I followed the directions EXACTLY and it was a fudge disaster!  All was well until poured over the confectioner's sugar.  I never could get it smooth, just to a pebbly texture.

My husband loves PB fudge, and has trouble finding kinds that taste peanut-buttery enough.  This is awesome, great PB taste, wonderful texture. I used the 1 c PB, 2 c brown sugar 3 c pow sugar recommendations. For those who had trouble with butter floating to the top, or crumbly when mixing in the pow sugar, I think it's the cooking time.  I timed it from the second I saw two bubbles break the surface, then exactly two minutes after I took it off the heat. After mixing in the powdered sugar it was still of pourable consistancy.  It did look a bit shiny on top as it cooled ( COOL AT ROOM TEMPERATURE! )  but that went away when it cooled completely.  Do not refrigerate the fudge!

This was yummy! My first time making fudge and it came out really creamy! I too followed the advice of the other reviews and adjusted the recipe to 3cups confectioners sugar  2 cups brown sugar and 1 cup of PB.  I also followed the suggestion of starting the 2 minute count down AFTER the boil starts!  Again the fudge came out great!  We're PB lovers in my house so next time I may another 1/2c PB and see how it comes out!!!

Excellent recipe if you follow the other reviews and use 2c. brown sugar 1c. peanut butter and 3c. powdered sugar. Also DO NOT stir during boil! This will result in clumpy pebbles not creamy fudge. Very easy to make. Would recommend to anyone!

Misty2829 is obviously , because the recipe says to add the sugar and milk to the butter and then stir until it boils.  People who can't follow recipes should not be allowed to post reviews!  This recipe is awesome!  I've made it for 2 years now and it's a huge hit with everyone!

This was my first time making fudge. I haven't tasted the chilled finished product yet, but I licked the beaters, and it was SUPER sweet, and as another reveiw said, not a lot of peanut butter flavor. I might try this again and make some adjustments, because it WAS easy!

This fudge did not meet my expectations at all. I followed the directions to a "T" to make sure I didn't have the issues others noted in their reviews. Guess what? It was like sand and not at all creamy. It was also way too sweet. I won't make this again.

I can't believe it.  After 40 years of trying to make a decent fudge I have finally done it.  Thank you. Thank you.  This fudge is delicious. I had no problems making it.  I put the powdered sugar in a big mixing bowl - boiled everything for about 2 1/2 minutes - beat everything together (I did use only 3 cups of powdered sugar) and poured in a dish.  Couldn't have been easier or better.

I gave it  four stars, after reading the other reviews I fixed the recipe up a bit. THese were very creamy and very good. Just to help out the person who wasn't quite sure. Make sure when you bring the butter and brown sugar to a boil you stop when it reaches the soft ball stage. Don't under boil and don't over boil. DOn't boil too fast either. Fudge is something you really need to watch. And make sure you read other helpful reviews too. SOmetimes recipes aren't quite right. And follow directions carefully. Fudge is really easy, but also really easy to mess up if you aren't careful. if you bring it to a boil quickly and then let it boil for exactly two minutes it may not turn out right. Bring to a boil slowly while constantly stirring and then let it boil only til the bubbles consume the top of it. Then remove it from the heat and finish the directions.

Best I've ever tasted, including fudge-shop made. Here's what I used:

½ cup butter
2 cups brown sugar
½ cup milk
1 cup peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups confectioners' sugar

I made this, then made a layer of Rocky Road fudge, and laid it down on top. It may just be the best fudge ever!

Sorry.  We really didn't like this too much.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it was too sweet and did taste like confectioners sugar and peanut butter mixed together.  Sorry...not for us.  Thanks anyway for the post.

This fudge is deffinately worthy of it's name!I think it's important to keep in mind, for the first time you make it, that it is very thick & seems almost too dry when you are beating it but you don't have to be super fussy with it.Don't let the pan size fool you for the amount because it's very thick so you don't need to cut it into very big pieces.

personally i don't like fudge, however i did make this fudge for the rest of my family and lets just say it got rave reviews. One tip though SIFT THE POWDERED SUGAR!!!!! and add it 1 cup at a time to the pot mixture....easier to handle and if it starts to cool down, turn the heat on low until you have finished incorperating the powder sugar.

I made this to put in my Christmas cookie trays and I have to say it is outstanding!  It tastes like something you would buy from a candy shop.  I followed the recipe to a T and had no problems.  Definitely a keeper!

WONDERFUL!  I've made chocolate fudge for years.  My husband asked for a peanut butter recipe last week so I tried this one.  So easy!  I used crunchy peanut butter (that's all I had) and some dark brown and some light brown sugar (that's all I had).  It was perfect.  You would never guess how easy this was once you tasted it.

The white sugar does not disolve--it all needs to be heated to disolve the sugar, otherwise it's like eating sand.

Wow, what a nice rich, creamy, delicious fudge! This is a great recipe for those of us who are not experienced candy makers. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used 1 cup PB, 2 cups of brown sugar and 3 cups of confectioners sugar.  Also, this recipe says it makes 15 servings. If that's true, it's 15 very large pieces. I cut mine smaller (which you can get away with because it's so rich) and got closer to 40.

Have been looking for a easy good peanut butter fudge recipe for awhile. This fits both. I used the 2 cups brown sugar 3 cups white sugar combo and used heavy cream because i had some to use up and we drink nonfat milk and I thought the heavy cream would be better. Definatly helped with my sweet tooth at 10:00 at night. Thanks for sharing.

There just isn't a way to describe how easy and delicious this is. I added a little cocoa powder to about 1/3 of the mix and swirled it in to make chocolate peanut butter fudge.  Very Yummy!

I read the previous reveiws and increased the peanut butter, and also reduced the confectioner's sugar.  This fudge was FABULOUS!  Have made it several times and it is wonderful.

After reading reviews, I also changed it to 1 cup peanutbutter, 2 cups brown sugar, and 3 cups powdered sugar. Overall, very easy fudge recipe. Turned out really well. I waited until the butter mix was at a full rolling boil before starting the 2 minute count. Very creamy fudge. Next time, I might use a little less peanut butter. Will make again!

I followed this recipe exactly the first time I made it, and it was a little too sweet and not quite peanut-buttery enough. This second time, I modified it the way others have suggested: 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup peanut butter. I also used Smart Balance peanut butter, which isn't quite as sweet as some of the regular brands, and used my kitchen aid mixer to get it a bit smoother this time. The end result: sheer perfection. With the slight modifications to the recipe, this fudge is to die for.

Super easy, fast and delicious! For those who want a little less sweet, a little more peanut butter flavor, just use natural pb with no added sugar. I also adjusted sugar as noted by other reviewers (2 c brown, 3 c powdered) and increased peanut butter to 1 cup.

Awesome! The Best. And awfully hard to kill. The recipe amounts are forgiving, you can experiment a little with flavour.  It also works equally as well with ICING SUGAR as it does with ICING MIXTURE (added later: and caster sugar if niether are available!) . The MAIN TRICK is to not boil it  too long. Soft ball (drop a little in a glass of water a soft ball will form) stage will give a lovely creamy consistency. If it gets too hot (boils too long) you may end up with dry pebbles as your sugar tries to head off to toffee land (I'm Australian if you're not sure what I mean). (addition:) Also, works as well with smooth, cruncy, sugar/salt free fresh smashed pb - whatever's yr thing. ENJOY

This fudge is awesome! It is the first time I have ever tried to make it and it turned out very tasty. I did have some issues getting it to set. Kept it in the fridge overnight and is still very soft. Can someone help give me some suggestions?!

This WAS delicious...I followed the advice of others and used less sugar/more peanut butter...but BEWARE!  If you are going to add more peanut butter, remember to REDUCE YOUR BUTTER!  I didn't do this, and my fudge was GREASY as it was setting...I soaked through four paper towels blotting the top!  Good recipe, but there are simpler ones with just as yummy results.

Beware - I cannot rate the recipe as written, but with the adjustments below it is 5 stars and then some.  I think it would have been too sweet and not peanut buttery enough as written.- 2 c brown sugar- 1 c peanut butter- 3 c conf sugar

My initial review for this was so/so, because it was too sweet and void of any real peanut butter taste.  I made a second batch, but this time I used 2 1/4 c of brown sugar, 3 cups of powdered sugar and 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter and it's DIVINE!  Perfectly sweet with lots of good peanut butter flavor!  I also kneaded it about 7 times to ensure it was smooth and the powdered sugar was incorporated.  The rating I'm giving is for the original recipe.

This was really good and actually the first fudge I've made that turned out well.  However, I would suggest reducing the brown sugar to about 2 C or a little less and increasing the peanut butter to about 1 C.  You may also want to decrease the confectioner's sugar but I don't know if that would intefere with the firmness.  Recipe as is, is very sweet.

I took the suggestion of other reviewer's and used two cups of brown sugar, three cups of powdered sugar and one cup of super chunk peanut butter. I also used evaporated milk. One of the best fudge recipes I've tried from this site, VERY creamy and VERY peanut buttery. May not be the exact recipe as printed--my thanks go to the other people who made it before me and offered suggestions!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I've made it several times, sometimes following the recipe exactly and sometimes using a few variations.  It's so easy, and it always turns out.  I did find that my family prefers the recipe using LIGHT brown sugar (the recipe simply states "brown sugar").  Dark brown sugar changed the taste and made it more caramel-ly, if that makes sense.  It took away from the peanut butter taste.  I also found that we preferred to use crunchy peanut butter.  It just gives it a little something extra.  I also highly recommend the recipe using other reviewers' changes: 3C confectioner's sugar, 2C brown sugar, and 1C peanut butter.

I love to cook and bake but I never tried making fudge until a co-worker asked me to make her some peanut butter fudge. So I searched online for a recipe and I was soooo lucky to find this one. After reading the reviews I also altered the recipe to 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter and just 3 cups powdered sugar and the results were flawless. I will say I burned the motor out in my cheap hand mixer on the first batch, but that was my mistake... I tried beating it for too long, but was worth it. Everyone raved about it at work and I have had several requests for more.   Thank you for such a wonderful recipe... now if only I can find one as good for chocolate fudge.

Per other reviews, I used 3 c. powdered sugar, 1 c. Peanut Butter and 2 c. loosely packed brown sugar. It turned out FABULOUS! Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the suggestions of reducing the sugar and increasing the peanut butter and it was really perfect. Definitely sweet enough and peanut buttery enough.

Just made this recipe, with the suggested changes, (2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioners sugar, 1 cup of peanut butter).  This is perfect Peanut Butter Fudge! Thanks for all the info.

im licking the beater as i write this and so far im sold. i remember my "granny" sweating, burning herself, cursing the candy thermometer. hah! just a quick tip, i also got the "pebbles in the bowl" after adding to conf. sugar. after two quick splashes of milk (while running the mixer) it turned into a creamy dream. c'mon people use a little imagination and chutzpah here! speaking of which anyone for stir ins (choc or toffee chips, peanuts, coconut)? next time!

This is a great recipe, very easy and cheaper to make than some of the other peanut butter fudge recipes. I followed suggestions of others and used 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 cup of peanut butter, and 3 cups of confectioners' sugar. After the first appearance of bubbles, I waited until the mixture came to a medium boil before I started the 2 minute timer. The result was FANTASTIC, super creamy fudge!   (Be sure to sift the confectioners' sugar or else you will have lumps.)

Very easy & very good fudge but I'm looking for the best peanut butter fudge.  I'll use this until I find it!  Just a small tip to peoples fudge that doesn't set.  Make sure it is boiling before you time it for 2 min.  On another recipe I tried I started timing it when it wasn't even boiling & the recipe didn't set for me.

I haven't tried this recipe as of yet and would like to ask those who did not like it, to try this, 
First was it dry or rainy the day you first tried this ?
Second what altitude are you at?
Third was it "cane" sugar or "beet" sugar you used the first time?
Between my Grandmother letting me know about the different sugars and my Sister Sally living at high altitudes I have learned that those are two factors in candy making that will make a difference and neighbor told me about the humidity, when my children were small.
If you can remember these factors it could help you next time.
I am going to try this over Christmas vacation for my Grandkids. 
Wish me luck.

UPDATE - I did not add peanut butter/vanilla after butter/brown sugar boiled. Added peanut butter & vanilla as recipe instructs.  Fudge beautifully creamy with a touch of crumble. **** I followed cooking directions as is, but did as others suggested and changed ingredients to 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter ( I used natural), 3 cups icing sugar.   I worried when I used mixer to blend icing sugar with base.  It says to pour into dish.  My fudge ingredients were crumbly and warm.  I could not pour!!! I had to press the fudge into dish.  The end result being:  Eddie, my yoga peers and neighbors want more!  The fudge has a moist yet sugar/crumble consistancy.  Thank you Angie for a great recipe!

Made this for this first time last Christmas (and I'm not a very seasoned baker), and it was sooooo easy to do and very, very good.  Took the suggestions of other reviews and reduced the sugars/increased the peanut butter.  Everyone loves this, I will be making it again for our Christmas Cookie Exchange.  Don't find this too sweet at all, but it's fudge - it's supposed to be a little sweet, right?  Thank you for this keeper of a recipe!

Fantastic fudge!  I've only attempted to make fudge once in my life (besides this) and it was a dismal failure.  Thanks for restoring my confidence!  I decided to make this just for fun today and it was easy, set up well, and is delicious!  Put foil in the pan before spreading the fudge in, and it made clean-up and cutting a breeze.  I reduced brown sugar down to 2 cups, powdered sugar to 3.  Used Adam's natural peanut butter.  Very rich and satisfying!

Absolutly amazing!  I'm 16 years old, and this was my first time making any sort of thing like this.  It was the easiest thing!  No room to mess up here.  I followed everyone's instructions on reducing the sugar, and it still came out very sweet.. it would probably have been too sweet if I didn't reduce the sugar.  

I found nothing wrong with the recipe!  Well, except the amount of fat, but hey, it was well worth it!!  My dad (aka my taste tester!) absolutly loved it.  His only complaint was there not being enough!  

This recipe did not last long in my house.  I've already been asked many times to make it again (4th time!).  A friend of mine told me she'd pay me to make her half a pan of this fudge.

It's a fan with everyone.  Big hit.  Try it, you wont regret it, and there's really no way to mess it up.

However, one tip, make sure you beat it long enough (I'd say 3 or 4 minutes continuous) or else it will be a bit liquidy and shmooshy.

Fantastic...made it several times, but always make the following adjustments: 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 3 cups confectioners sugar.  Perfect every time.

This is the first time I've made fudge without marshmallow creme and it was fabulous!!! It firmed up nicely, had a super creamy texture,was super easy to make. I used a hand mixer, but next time I'll use my Kitchenaid. I will also sift the confectionary sugar.  Definitely a keeper. For those who's fudge didn't get hard, you probably cooked it too long.

Hmmm, really good!  While growing up, my mom used to make peanut butter fudge the old fashioned way -- using a candy thermometer, beating until her arm became sore, the whole works.  This is so, so much easier and (don't tell Mom) tastes even better that the old fashioned kind.  One trick I used, though, was using a handmixer to beat in the confectioner's sugar.  This minimized any lumps.

I love peanut butter fudge and this is the recipe I've been searching for!!  It tastes like the "old-fashioned" fudge that's so yummy! This is the perfect recipe if your looking for a traditional fudge without the marshmellow cream!  Thanks for the wonderful, extremely easy to make recipe that me and my 2 year old son can't get enough of! I also want to say that the peanut butter used DOES make a difference!  I've made this many times and Reeses p/b is the absolutely the best!

I followed the instructions to a tee, but the fudge didn't harden enough. (Semi-Firm to hold its shape, but not hard.) (?) In addition, I found that the recipe was WAY too sweet. The recipe was easy enough, but failed to deliver. Sorry Angie, I won't be making this one again. :(

Yum!! As the other reviewers said, 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter and 3 cups confection sugar. Very easy, tasty fudge. My new go-to for PB fudge. If you got pebbles, it was probably boiled too long.  2 minutes with a timer, take it off the burner, add PB and vanilla, pour over confection sugar and it should be fine:)

As suggested by other users, I too used 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter (or more!) and 3 cups powdered sugar. It is pretty sweet, but the more peanut butter you add, the better! I've made this 3 times now, and it is by far the best peanut butter fudge I've ever had. Everyone who has tried it has absolutely loved it! Not to mention, it is REALLY easy to make!

This was a super easy recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 3 cups confectioners sugar, 1 cup peanut butter and 2 cups brown sugar ( I actually used 1 white and 1 brown since I only had 1 cup of brown). I let the sugar/butter mixture come to a rolling boil and timed it for 2 minutes then removed from heat added the peanut butter and vanilla then SLOWLY added (1/2 c. at a time) the powered sugar to the pot which I was stirring with a wisk. It is a good arm workout but the fudge turned out smooth and yummy. :O)

I tried this one when I didn't have the marshmallow creme needed for another one, and honestly this was only so-so.  I thought the texture was too crumbly and dry.  So far, out of the peanut butter fudge I've tried on this site, World's Best Peanut Butter Fudge is the best.  That recipe is so creamy, smooth and melts in your mouth.  The brown sugar in this recipe I feel makes the taste of the fudge a little too strong.  The other recipe very much resembles what I used to buy when I worked in Northern Michigan on Mackinac Island which is known for fudge.  I think I'll stick to that one from now on!

This was my first time making fudge, I can't believe how easy it was! I took another users advice to line the dish with saran wrap so taking out would be easier- it worked like a charm! I then cut out fudge using christmas cookie cutters and handed out as gifts for christmas, people were really impressed! Thank you :)

DONT MAKE THIS IF YOUR DIABETIC, Wow this is super easy to make. I mixed everything with a wooden spoon and I cut back on the sugars like others did. It was great but it is SWEEEEEEET.

2nd time I added 1/4 cup unsweetened Cocoa. It lessened the sweetness a lot but it is still sweet

This recipe makes great peanut butter fudge!  This was the second year we made this recipe and it turned out great both times.  We make it using the suggestions of a lot of others, with the ratio of 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups powdered, and 1 cup peanut butter.  We double those ingredients plus the other remaining ingredient ratios in the recipe to make a 13x9 full of fudge.  Its so creamy and rich!  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

My new peanut butter fudge recipe.  I was looking for a good, fairly easy peanut butter fudge recipe that didn't call for marshmallow creme.  This is perfect.  I used my stand mixer - much easier than using a hand mixer to combine everything.

Trick for me: whip the peanut butter before hand!  I found that whipping the peanut butter, just with a spoon, helped me get it blended with the hot liquid faster.  This is the best fudge I have ever made, and was so glad it did not involve marshmallow creme! :-)  Couple things: Be sure to heat as it says, MEDIUM!  I have ruined a different recipe because I got in a hurry.    In all it took me a good 20 minutes start to finish, but so worth it.    I tossed walnuts in with the powdered sugar too.  Great!

My 13 year old daughter made this for us and it was so rich and yummy.  I couldn't believe how great it was.  We took some to our friends at church and our friend said that it was the best pb fudge he had ever eaten!  Thank you for the great recipe!

In my first attempt at making some fudge, I wanted a recipe that was pretty easy to follow and this was it!! I made this recipe today and my peanut butter fudge turned out great. I followed the comments that were made from other reviews and used 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 3 cups confectioner's sugar (well I didnt exactly have 3 cups but it still turned out great!). I also made sure that the mixture was at a hard rolling boil before i started to time it for 2 minutes. Once i had taken it off of the heat and added in the peanut butter and vanilla in, it had started to thicken up rather quickly so i had to quickly beat in the confectioners's sugar (beated it in on low heat). This is a very easy recipe and I will definately make it again!!

The taste is not bad but the only texture I can feel when eating it is sugar... Like eating a spoonful... If there was a way to make it more creamy or melt in your mouth-ish I would love it...

Amazingly easy and creamy, the only thing I would suggest it to decrease the powdered sugar by about 1/4 cup.  I will definitely make often.  Thank you so much for the post

Mixed reviews on this recipe. I followed the changes others suggested,3cps. confectioners sugar, 2 cups brown sugar, and 1 cup peanutbutter. After pouring in the pan I left it out on the counter to "chill" since many others said not to refrigerate. I tried it about 2 hrs later and it had a soft consistency, not fudgelike. I put it in the refrigerator overnight hoping it would harden, which it did, but still not the consistency of what I think of fudge.  Took it to a family cookout and some really liked it and some were just ok with it. I might try it again another time but will look for another recipe in the mean time.

I'm writing this review as i am licking the bowl. yummmmmmy! :P and i read the other reviews, if you think its crumbly (which mine was at first) then you should put it in the mixer. thats what i did and it came out PERFECTLY! and to the reviews that say this recipe is too sweet, try eating some cauliflower cuz fudge is supposed to be sweet!

This recipe shouldn't even be on here. I followed the directions EXACTLY. The fudge ended up being a clumpy powder that I had to throw away.

I'm not one of those people who casually disregards directions, either. I'm an experienced cook who knows the importance of following a proper recipe. Please revise this recipe.

Very easy and delicious recipe.  I followed the advice on the cutting back on the sugar and it comes out perfect every time.  Even when you make a double batch. I did however have the same problem of the crumbling the first time.  My mixture cooled down too much.  30 seconds in the microwave on high and it was just a smooth as can be when I continued beating it!!!  Thanks a bunch!

After a coworker brought some peanut butter fudge her mother-in-law made, I was determined to find my own recipe. This tastes SO good -- it's just like the fudge I had!
I sifted two cups of the powdered sugar into a large bowl, where I used my mixer to blend it with the peanut butter and vanilla. While I was doing this, I had the other stuff on a slow boil on the stove. I greased up a pan, poured it all in, and had no powdered sugar lumps. It's setting in the fridge right now, but I had to lick the spatula -- it tastes great!

This turned out to be a perfect peanut butter fudge.  It just melts in your mouth.  Great flavor... I had several guest at Christmas dinner compliment how much they liked this fudge.  
Note; when I first made this I had a pinch of it to taste.  Seemed way to sweet, after sitting several days it was perfect.  The sugar must break down and the texture changes to a smooth-creamy fudge.   

Thanks for sharing... We loved it!

I was really looking forward to some delicious peanut butter fudge.  It is extremely sweet with very little peanut butter flavor and the consistency is flaky or gritty rather than smooth.  I do not recommend this recipe.

This was sooooo sweeet! wow, but so addictive! I would eat it then go into sugar shock and then 10 minutes later I would have a craving for more. I loved this fudge, however, none or my co-workers, nor my boyfriend would have seconds because it was too sweet, and so I ate it all my-self.

Very easy to make and w/ ingredients usually on hand.  Was very good, but extremely rich (sweet).  I went back and cut all of the pieces in half.  Thankfully a little goes a long way because the dogs got most of it under the Christmas tree.  (FYI, apparantly dogs love peanut butter and can sniff it out even when well concealed)!

Very simple recipe.  I cut the brown sugar to 2 cups and the confectioner's sugar to 3 cups.  Also increased the peanut butter to 1 cup.  This seems to cut the sweetness some and give more of a peanut buttery taste.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and I had no problems with it.  My mother and grandmother, who hate peanut butter, started munching on the fudge before it was even cold.  I followed previous reviewers' suggestions, decreasing the powdered sugar to 3 cups and the brown sugar to 2 cups and increasing the peanut butter to 1 cup.  Also, since I had no creamy peanut butter, I used crunchy peanut butter.  It added a delightful taste.  I also was low on milk, so I used 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream, and the fudge seemed to set up perfectly.  I would suggest sifting the powdered sugar before measuring it, and mixing the fudge with an electric beater at the very end.  Also, I had 1/4 cup of leftover mini chocolate chips, which I stirred in after everything was mixed and slightly cooled.  It gave the fudge a wonderful marbled look without making it too chocolate-y.

This was very easy to make and tastes great! For those of you thinking about making this, remember that if the PB says on the jar 18oz that is it's WEIGHT. A cup of PB is over half of an 18oz jar.I used the 1 cup PB, 2 cups BrS, 3 cups CS, that others had mentioned and it worked wonderfully. Yummy!

mmmmmm....so good! i made this with the 'Homemade Yummy Fudge' to give out for the holidays and it came out great! I got a bit paranoid after reading the reviews about needing to really time the cooking time exactly, but I did it for 2 1/2 min after the first bubbles came up and it firmed up wonderfully. I did 2 C brown sugar, 3 C confectioners sugar, and 1 C pb as other viewers suggested. yummmmmmmmmm!

It was great. My mistake was that I thought that was a bit too much butter and I cut it in half. It made it too crumbly. In the future, I will add the whole amount.

This is the easiest and best recipe I've ever tried. I admit I read the reviews and tweaked it (a little sugar and little more butter) and it was perfect. I had to hide it from myself last night. Thanks for an awesome and easy recipe.

Make sure it comes to a roaring boil for the recommended time to let it get the right texture,
I think this is the cause of previous failure. I added Semi-sweet chips to make Reeses Peanut butter fudge!
It was great!!!

I fixed this for my office and everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe.  Everyone mentioned how creamy it was.  I used rice milk which made it lower in fat and you couldn't taste the difference.

Easy is right!  I have never made fudge before and this was SO simple to do and quick!  We had a picnic to go to and had to bring an item and I didn't have much in the house, I found this recipe and my family loves peanut butter so I gave it a try.  It was a big hit!

Best Peanut Butter fudge recipe ever!!! This is creamy and moist. Makes a bunch, so you might want to reduce the recipe if you are not cooking for company. Thanks for a great recipe!

GREAT recipe done the old fashioned way!  Easy to do.  I replaced 1/2 of the milk with heavy whipping cream.  It was SUPER delicious and didn't have that "manufactured" taste that most fudge recipes have these days.  Used CHUNKY peanut butter for added touch.

I followed this recipe precisely and the finished product was very crumbly and greasy.  I'm not sure what went wrong, but I see that this happened to other people also.  A lot of wasted time and ingredients!

Following the advice of many others, I too reduced the brown sugar to 2 cups, Increased the peanut butter to 1 cup, and reduced the powered sugar to 3 cups. When it came to boiling, I started the two minute time after it came to a boil. When I added the peanut butter and vanilla, I didn't remove from the heat, I just kept it on simmer. I sifted the powered sugar to avoid it being chunky. When I finally added the peanut butter mix, it was very easy to mix at a medium speed. I put everything in an 8x8 greased foiled lined dish, for easy removal.

This was great but I had to give it three stars because I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 2C brown sugar, 3 C. confectioners' sugar and 1 C. peanut butter. It is great that way. I would definitely recommend using those amounts. If you use the amounts listed, you would probably die of sweetness.

Holy smoke, is this stuff good.  I also followed the adjusted directions as other suggested, 1C PB, 2C Brown Sugar and 3C Powdered Sugar.  It's a bit on the sweet side still, but it's very good.  Soft, creamy and a good peanut butter taste.  Make sure you wrap it up while in storage or it will dry out and get crumbly.  Thanks for sharing.

I for one,think this is a great recipe....However,don't rate this with the changes YOU made...It is not the same recipe,and many will try it becuase you rated it incorrectly...I read on here that someone used this recipe and won prizes with it,so it REALLY can't be all that bad...Submit your own recipe with the changes,and rate as written...

This was my first time making any kind of fudge.  Everyone said that I couldn't make it because I'm still a novice cook (usually burn everything).  This was so good that I shared it with the people at the local little gas station.  They said that it was soo much better than what they are currently selling, and said that I should sell it there.  I did follow everyones advice about cutting back on the sugars and using 1 full cup of peanut butter.

Didn't turn out for me - I was not able to incorporate all of the powdered sugar as described and ended up with something I had to form into cubes by hand to keep together.  Then coated in melted chocolate + peanut butter chips and it was edible, but I wouldn't call it fudge!

I followed it perfectly and the "fudge" was just a bunch of pebble look-a-likes.  When I put it in the fridge, the butter rose to the top and hardened.

This is a great recipe.  One reader had a problem with it turning into peanut butter pebbles and dry crumbs. I have had this happen before also. I think the weather and humidity can sometimes play a role in how your fudge turns out, I have been told. I don't know if this is an old wives' tale or not  but sometimes I make it and it is creamy and great, other times it is dry and crumbly despite the fact that I make it the exact same way each time.

This is the first time I've made this. I followed others' advice to add 3 cups powdered sugar, 2 cups brown sugar and 1 cup pb.  I also began the 2 min. boil time as soon as I saw the little bubbles begin.  It turned out wonderful!  Creamy, smooth and tastey.  You need to beat it well with a mixer to get the creamy smooth state.  :-)  Super yummy , easy and fast.  I don't think my thighs will appreciate it , but my family does!

" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!"  I just tried this recipe for the first time and OMG it turned out awesome!!!
Like other viewers, I went with the 3,2,1 and what more can you say?
I will say however it`s a good idea to have everything pre measured prior to starting because you do need to be fast when mixing and pouring and mixing again.
The hotter the mixture is the better it will mix in the end!

I love this recipe! This is the second year I've made this fudge and everyone goes crazy over it. I did change it up a little this year and used 1 cup of peanut butter as I wanted it to have more peanut butter flavor. Also, I didn't use an 8x8 pan but a square 10 inch dish-they would be too thick in an 8x8. Makes a wonderful gift for my daughter's teachers!

Great fudge...when you forrow the original recipe. I did it the way it says first, but letting it boil without stirring before adding the milk, and hand stirring it and mashing the C sugar's lumps out. FABULOUS fudge. I then did it the way the reviews said, boil a little, use 2c. brown sugar 1c. peanut butter and 3c. powdered sugar. And used the mixer. Not again. Only OK. I am sticking with the original recipe.   BTw I only use Teddy P'nutbutter, no extra sugar. Maybe thats why some people's is too sweet. Mine is not.

This recipe is awesome!  I followed the suggestion in another comment and used 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioners sugar, and 1 full cup peanut butter, and it turned out perfect!  Thick and rich and creamy.  I also used dark brown sugar, and I love how the flavor of it comes through.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

The taste was amazing.  Big hit with the kids-even my non-peanut butter lover.  Per other's advice, I will start the boiling time when it starts to simmer.  It was too dry waiting for the full boil.

This was such an easy recipe to do, I followed the others reviews by doing 3c confec sugar, 2c brown sugar, 1c peanut butter. It turned out very smooth and not hard. I used cling wrap to line the pan and it made it so much more easy to take out with no fuss. I will have to boil it just a tad longer next time cause it was just a little too soft. I was however a great hit with everyone who tried it. Thank you for sharing

I Screwed up the first time, because i thought confectioners sugar was white table sugar...whoops!! it turned out all lumpy.
So i did it again, using the right confectioners' sugar aka icing sugar/powder sugar, and after following the reviews, and went with the 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 3 cups confectioners' sugar. And out came a perfect creamy fudge result!! HOORAY!!

I made this for Christmas and forgot to review it until now. The taste was very yummy, however the texture was crumbly. I let it set in the fridge and then tried cutting it, but it was crumbling rather than cutting. So I then let it sit out for a few minutes and tried cutting again. Much better! If you store this in the fridge, it will be crumbly if eaten right away. I suggest taking it out of the fridge for a few minutes before serving. It makes it 100x better! Thanks for the great recipe!

I doubled this recipe, and reserved 1/4 of the batter at the end and mixed in about 1/8 cup of cocoa powder to make a chocolate peanut butter fudge (you could tweak more or less to your taste). I also used 1/2 natural peanut butter and 1/2 regular "sugared" peanut butter.  This was a hit. Makes a ton of servings (if you cut into bite-sized portions), freezes fantastic. Everyone loved it.

Ok, so i made this peanut butter fudge according to recommendations from other reviewers, with 2C. brown sugar and 3C. powdered/confectioners sugar. While i was boiling the butter/milk/brown sugar mixture, instead of only boiling for 2 minutes, i continued to boil the mixture at med-high heat for about 5-7 minutes and used a candy thermometer to check the tempurature of the mixture, waiting until it was close to the soft ball stage and just to be sure, i also did the "drop in cold water" method. When i was satisfied that it was up to temp, i added the peanut butter and vanilla, and found that the mixture was already starting to "set/thicken" like proper peanut butter fudge would, but i did however finish the recipe as it says and added the powdered sugar. While mixing with my hand mixer i found i had to add another 1/4 C of milk because the mixture was becoming crumbly and not smooth at all. still came out good but a little tip. if you wait till the sugar/butter/milk mixture reaches soft ball stage, you really dont need the powdered sugar because it will set properly on its own and will taste much more like proper old fashioned peanut butter fudge.

Followed recipe exactly, and it was just dry crumbs in the bowl when I mixed the wet and dry ingredients. People reviewing recipes should review them as is. I picked this one because it had good reviews.. VERY disappointed in the results.

This fudge is delicious!  During the beating process I had to add a couple teaspoons of milk to get it to become creamy (instead of lumpy).  I've also made this into a DELICIOUS chocolate peanut butter fudge by adding 4 squares of Ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate to the butter/sugar mixture & cooking while stirring constantly until it is combined.  Fabulous!

As with the last several reviews, I increased the PB to 1 cup, decreased the brown sugar to two cups and the confectioners' sugar to three cups.  Even so, this fudge is EXTREMELY sweet.  Even with the changes, it still uses 5 cups of sugar for a yield of 15 pieces.  I am usually a big sweets fan...baking is my favorite.  I honestly don't ever remember saying that anything was "too" sweet.  However, this recipe fit that description.  I am really surprised at how many people did not mention this fact.  Overall, the fudge had a good consistency, but was just too sweet.  I would recommend going with a recipe that uses marshmallow or marshmallow cream.  They tend to come out with a much more "peanuty" flavor!

Honestly as I made this I was thinking two stars. I had the same problem as others with the crumble factor. The recipe states to beat until smooth...after reducing the brown sugar and powdered sugar adding more peanut butter and a touch more milk it was still just crubmbles. I ended up pressing everything into the pan and fridging it for 4 hours and OH MY! SOOOOO good! So don't panic if you see crumbles. It is worth it!

This is the best fudge recipe EVER! I used less brown sugar and less confectioner's sugar but more peanut butter. I also used a dark chocolate peanut butter. It disappears fast around my house.

Excellent, easy recipe.  Very smooth and creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.  I did, however, follow the advice of other reviewers and use 1 cup peanut butter, 2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups confectioner's sugar.  Will definitely be making this again.  Just made a batch yesterday and it's almost gone!  Perfect for Christmastime to have around for drop-in company.  Will make this my standard along with my usual chocolate fudge.  Thank you for a truly outstanding recipe, although altered a tad.

i dont know why this recipe has such a good rating when every reviewer has re-written the recipe with multiple variations. I just made it as written, and I too ended up with a crumbly mess that I tried a little bit and it basically tastes like powdered sugar. NOT RECOMMENDED.

I would not make this recipe again.  I wish I had read other reviews before making.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The fudge tastes good, but is crumbly- not smooth and creamy like it should be.  It needed more peanut butter and probably less confectioner's sugar.  I would try another recipe before this one.

I used 1 cup peanut butter, 2 cups brown sugar, and 3 cups powdered sugar (which I sifted) as others have suggested.  I set the timer for two minutes after it came to a good boil, as opposed to setting the timer as soon as I saw a few bubbles.  The fudge set up perfectly, had a good texture, and tasted pretty good.  I'm not a fan of peanut butter fudge that has a strong brown sugar taste as this one does, so I'll be going back to the recipe for Creamy Peanut Butter Fudge on this site, which I prefer.

This turned out wonderful despite my screwups! lol I did not have powder sugar, so I made my own. It still malts in your mouth, but tends to fall apart easy now that it's cool. I also used the 1-2-3 cup changes, and used extra crunchy peanut butter. Can't wait to make this again when better prepared!!!

This was really easy. I did have a slight problem mixing the confectioner's sugar in and to dissolve. It left chunks and took a lot of stirring. I chose this recipe because I have a limited amount of baking supplies/tools, so this might have turned out better if I had had an electric mixer. Still not bad though, just a little elbow grease required.   I followed others' advice and did the 3 cups confectioners, 2 cups brown sugar (1 cup light brown, 1 cup dark brown, just because of my supply), and 1 cup peanut butter. They were still really sweet, even though the sugar amount is less.   Due to the sweetness and inability for anybody to eat more than a half-inch chunk at a time, I was able to get about 60 pieces out of this, so about 20 servings. Originally I had planned on aking two batches for a party, but one turned out to be enough.   Thanks for the recipe, I'll probably try it again.

I didn't change anything but I did make a batch of fantasy fudge (with Ghiradelli chocolate)and put it in a 9x13 pan. Then I made this and put it on top of it for a double layer fudge. Very good!

I made a batch of this fudge this morning. Since I'm not a big fan of peanut butter fudge, I had my Husband try it. He said it was creamy and delicious! So simple and easy to make too.

I used others suggestion and did the 1, 2, 3 changes. I also used half creamy peanut butter and half extra crunchy... Perfect!!

This recipe's 5 stars makes all my old 5 star recipes seem like 3's!!  It is a fantastic and easy recipe.  I used skim milk....to lighten the calories (ha, ha)!  The fudge is very soft and melts in your mouth....as good or better than any fudge I have bought at the beach!  Will definitely make every year!

Turned out fine, but no one cared for the taste.  I think it would taste better with white sugar than brown sugar.

I had no faith whatsoever in my ability to make fudge, but this turned out perfect! I used the 1-2-3 cup changes suggested by other reviews. And in my grocery, powdered sugar and confectioner's sugar are completely identical food items. Don't spend the extra 50 cents for a name brand. No need. Thanks for posting this awesome easy recipe!

After reviewing other ratings, I altered the recipe using 1C peanut butter, 2C brown sugar and 3C confectioners sugar.  It came out very smooth and tasty, but it never got hard.  It is so smooth i can scoop it out like butter.  Where did I go wrong?

This fudge turned out FANTASTIC!  I took everyones suggestion at altering the sugar and pb amounts and I did sift the powdered sugar to get the lumps out.  I made sure to keep the stove on medium heat, being PATIENT and waiting for the brown sugar and butter mix to come to a boil, as I read somewhere that cranking up the heat can be a big mistake.  As soon as it started to bubble at a good rate I watches the time and took it off at exactly 2 minutes.  I had no problems incorporating the hot mixture with the powdered sugar using a hand mixer.  at the very end I mixed in a handful of bittersweet chocolate chips.  Now, I have never made fudge before and have only tried it a couple times in my life, not really a fan of fudge at all.  But I wanted to try it as many seem to like fudge for holiday gifts.  I have to say, I thought it was WAY too sweet at first...but I kept going back for more!  now I'm not really sure if it is too sweet, or I just needed to get used to the taste of "fudge" itself.  Next time I might try cutting down just a tablespoon or 2 on each of the sugars.  But beyond that, it is ADDICTIVE!  Just the right level of "creamy, melt in your mouth" and it set up perfectly.  It wasn't too soft or too hard, no crumbling, no lumping, cut like a dream with a sharp knife.  a keeper!!

I love this  fudge, I make it all the time!. I think its a good idea to reduce the sugar, I just do it by eye. To anyone who has done this recipe and had it turn out crumby, this happened to me once, and I brought it to my neighbour who is a cook, and she told me that I had boiled it too long! Watch your boiling time very carefully!!

I have never made fudge before, so I was looking for a relatively easy recipe.  This turned out wonderful!!!  I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews about the lumps, but I blended it together with my hand held mixer and it made it smooth.  I did take the advice of the other reviews and changed the recipe to 1 cup Peanut Butter, 2 cups of brown sugar and 3 cups of confectioner's sugar.

I'm not sure how some people's fudge turned out pebbly or with bits of powdered sugar. I followed the steps exactly ( except adjusting the sugar proportions as others said was best to do ) and the fudge turned out perfect !!! They just must not be very good in the kitchen, because I'm only 16 and it turned out wonderful !!! I definitely recommend that you try this. It's delcious and very simple to make.

So easy.  It practically made itself.  It was the best peanut butter fudge I've ever had.  It only costed about $4.00 for the ingredients, and made 15 huge pieces.  Locally, fudge is over $9.00 a pound, and this made several pounds and was way better!

I modified the recipe as several people before me suggested.  I used the 1 cup peanut butter, 2 cups brown  sugar, 3 cups powered sugar.  Came out very good and very rich.  I had no idea fudge was this easy to make!

I also used the 1 cup of peanut butter, 2 cups of brown sugar, and 3 cups of conf. sugar. I used evapotated milk instead of regular milk. This was very very good. My kids even liked to put this on ice cream. I just didn't add the conf. sugar and pour it on ice cream. YUM!

I made this recipe just as listed, but in the future will use the suggested changes.  I mixed it by hand, and although it was a bit pebbley, it was not a problem once it set up. I do not like really sweet desserts, and this was much too rich for me, but I am giving it five stars as I made it for a party, and everyone died over it, wondering who had made it and where I had gotten the recipe. That'll work!

This was super easy and the children loved it.  I had to be quick though, because it was firming up before I had it spread in the dish.  I took other posts suggestions and made it 1 cup peanut butter and 2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups confectioners' sugar.  I'm glad I did or it would have been too sweet.  The only complaint I have is that after a day it starts to dry out some.  Trying to think of what I can do to add a little more moisture.

I do not understand how this rates 5 star. It tastes good but it never hardened enough. I followed the directions to a t. Will not make again.

A darker appearance and more complex flavor than the pnb fudge we usually make. Use a Kitchen Aid mixer for best results! The top gets just a little dry if not covered immediately. There was just a bit of graininess, so next time, I will cook it longer. The jury (the family, of course) is still out on this one. Don't know if it will replace our prize-winning recipe, but it's worth your time. The brown sugar gives it a caramel overtone.

I think I've gained 10 pounds but it was worth it. Creamy, peanuty, lovely. I did as other reviewers and increased pb and decreased sugar. I can't wait to make it again! Mine was perfectly firm. Note though that it's not going to get much thicker from the stove after it's cooled, so if it's not firm enough for you, you might have to add some more PB and powdered sugar to thicken.

Yummy!!!  This was really easy to make and delicious to eat.  The only thing is it didn't get very firm but the taste sure made up for the stickiness!  I will definitely be making it again!

This was my first attempt at fudge making and I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of this recipe.  The fudge tasted wonderful and was easy to make and easy to clean up.  Definately glad I tried it.

I tried it and I thought it would fail, but it didn't and I loved it. That peanut butter really gave it that extra flavor I always wanted. I'm from the Netherlands and although people love peanut butter overhere, they do not put it in their fudge and candy and I missed that. Now with this recipe I can make it myself, so thank you for this easy recipe!

So Easy! We all love this! Added more peanut butter and made easter eggs with it this year, but normally just leave the recipe the way it is. The fastest and BEST fudge recipe I've tried.

In a word...perfect! This was so simple and turned out even better than I had hoped for. I can't figure out why or how anyone could have a problem with this one. It is well worth trying again.

This was so simple and had a nice creamy taste.  Mine did turn out on the soft side so I will let it refrigerate and set longer.

The quickest and easiest fudge I ever made, but VERY sweet.  Next time I will either use chunky peanut butter, or add my own nuts, and also use a little less sugar.  Over all, quite good and fool proof.

Being vegan, I used Earth Balance buttery spread (a really great non-hydrogenated margarine) and soy milk in this recipe. I left the PB and sugar (didn't pack the brown sugar) amounts as called for. I used "natural" peanut butter with the separated oil poured off, which makes the PB taste *really* peanutty, so the fudge was quite sweet AND quite peanutty.

I beat the liquid into sifted powdered sugar by hand, which was a little difficult. A hand mixer would have been easier, I think. All in all, the fudge turned out great! My husband LOVED it.

butter- o goodness gracious, talka bout indulgence.

Just made this fudge this morning. Seems to have set up well. Added extra peanut butter as suggested and lowered the sugar. Used chunky PB - I think it will be yummy! This recipe was very easy, and at least from licking the bowl, it is fabulous. I am thinking of melting some chocolate and drizzling it over the top - kind of  Reese's peanut butter cup effect. Can't wait to try it out! Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous recipe!  Very easy - took me only 20 minutes to make and was firmed up in about an hour and a half in the refrigerator.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks so much. - Karen

Very easy to make - it came out the first time I made it!  However, it is very sweet and I would recommend using a 1/2 cup less confectioners' sugar as mine came out very dry!  No hardening problems at all!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is probably the BEST peanut butter fudge I have ever tasted.  I made it for my super-picky boyfriend for sweetest day and he couldn't get enough of it.  Now I am making it again for Thanksgiving. I don't know what problem people are having with it firming up.  I refridgerated mine all night and it was fine..perfect texture.  A REALLY GREAT recipe!!! :o)

To let it harden...you need to refridgerate it over night. Then the next day it is quite hard. This is Sweet, but the sweeter the better in my house!!! ;o)

This fudge is amazing! It's very rich and very sweet even after I adjusted the recipe according to other reviews(2 c brown sugar, 1 c peanut butter, and 3 c powdered sugar). But it was a huge hit at a party! Everybody loved it and there was none leftover at the end of the night!

I made this recipe exactly as recommended multiple times and it was a hit! To mix it up one time I substituted Nutella for peanut butter and it was just as good...if not better! It's great for sharing! Make sure to store in air tight container to keep soft.

This is a GOOD fudge recipe. But I only say Good and not Great because it's too sweet and not enough peanut butter taste so that's why it only received 5 stars. I have made this twice now, first time exact recipe and the second with the suggested changes.  I reduced the brown sugar to 2 cups, upped the peanut butter to 1 cup, reduced the powdered sugar to 3 cups, and even subbed the 1/2 cup milk for heavy whipping cream. Now THAT was a 5 star fudge!  The texture was perfect, the peanut butter flavor just right and such a creaminess you wouldn't believe. Hubby took one bite and was like a kid in a candy store! He's made me promise over and over to save the recipe while he's going back for another piece.

As many have said, up the peanut butter, down the sugar. It's waaaaaay too sugary by default and overpowers the peanut butter entirely. With a shift to 1 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1 3/4 brown sugar, it comes out pretty much perfect. As a borderline diabetic, my sugar tends to swing up and down wildly so I usually keep a bag of this recipe in the fridge. If I get a sugar low, grab a little piece and problem's solved. Stores for at least 3-4 weeks without issue as long as it's in the fridge. Again, to stress this once more, I love sugary stuff... and sometimes even physically need it, but DO NOT make the recipe as printed; ALWAYS swap half a cup of brown sugar for extra peanut butter instead!

I just started making peanut butter fudge for the first time. This recipe is perfect and so good! It's very simple. I used 2 cups brown sugar & 3 cups confectioners powdered sugar like the other reviewers.  After it begins a good boil, time it for 2 minutes. Excellent every time!!!

Perfect recipe with a few tweaks from other reviewers: use 2 C. brown sugar, 3 C. confectioner's, and 1 C. peanut butter.  I make it often and love how fast and easy it is.

I don't make this very often because I can't stop eating it. I don't usually like peanut butter but this stuff is addicting! And it is so easy to prepare so I have to make extra efforts to control myself and not give into making it whenever I need a sugar fix. Recipe is great as is, but I have been in a bind and had to use canola oil instead of butter and it tasted just as good.

Oh my gosh, we cannot stop eating this fudge.  I have made it twice.  I followed the other reviews and made changes to brown sugar, powdered sugar, and peanut butter.  To give it a richer peanut butter taste, I added 1/4 cup more the second time I made it.  I let it sit on my counter until it cools down before refrigeration.  It comes out creamy and delicious.

I followed the other reccomendations as well for 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups powdered sugar, and 1 cup peanut butter. I used Jif extra crunchy though - and it came out perfect. No lumps. I did not stir while it boiled. As soon as the liquid started to bubble at the edges is when I set the timer for two minutes. Havent eaten it yet, but the batter tasted delicious and has a good consistency. So far - definitely a thumbs up!

I've been looking for a fudge recipe for EVER that didn't come out crumbly and dry. I FOUND IT! This is hands down the best I've come across! Now, I did make some changes as the other reviews recommended, & here's what I did; I used 2cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioners sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, 1 full cup of peanut butter. I was nervous about the boiling stage so here's what I did; I stirred the ingredients together ALOT until the first couple bubbles started, right away I started my 2 minute timer and I never stirred it for them full 2 minutes. It worked for me!!! Thanks so much for an amazing recipe, the fudge turned out creamy & smooth, just like at the bakers!!! My husband was SOOO excited for a perfect fudge!! :)

I've made this (sort of ) recipe twice now. I did follow another reviewers advice and changed it to 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioners sugar and 1 cup peanut butter. So I can't compare with the original version, in all fairness. But what I can say is that the changes worked just fine both times. This is a HUGE crowd pleaser, and turned out 2 out of 2 times. And the first time, I even had to alter that a bit because I didn't have enough creamy peanut butter. I used about 1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter to make the cup called for. I actually think I preferred that batch over the full on creamy pb batch. But whatever. Both are good. The main thing that sells me on this recipe is that I usually have all the ingredients on hand and I can whip it up in no time. When I find a recipe that requires ingredients I have, can be made in a reasonable time frame, and makes the crowd roar, I consider it a keeper!

i had this recipe for 40 years and i made it all the years my children was growing up and they loved it one of my sons liked it with the chuncky peanut butter and the other two liked it the creamy way so i made both i also only used 3 cups of the confection sugar and 2 cups of the brown sugar but with the peanut butter i would by the reg. size i think its 12 0r 14oz and would use the whole bottle and it would come out wonderful so creamy and taste unreal but i would never store it in the frig. only because it would harden and become stale to fast ''' but then with 3 boys it never lasted that long anyways.thank God you have this posted and i found this recipe again because after  my sons got married i lost it and now i wanted to have it to bake some fudge for my church bake sale this sunday ,im so happy i found it again thank you so much God Bless You for having it still around (:

Made these today and they turned out wonderful! I did use the suggestions for the 2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups confectioners sugar. Plus, I love peanut butter, so I added 1 1/2 cups instead of 1. Gonna have to hide them from the kids!

This was very easy to make, and turned out well. I will add more peanut butter the next time, to make it a bit more creamy. All in all, a great recipe.

needs to boil longer so the brown sugar melts all the way. you can feel the crunch from the brown sugar. which everyone said they didn't like. also i followed others and added 2cups of brown sugar, 1cup of peanut butter (i wish i would have put 1 1/2cups of peanut butter instead of the 1cup. all of my friends said it needed more pb) and 3cups of confectioners sugar.

TO DIE FOR!!!  As other reviewers did, I changed the measurements in the peanut butter and sugar a bit. It keeps for a long time in the fridge too, which I love about that!

So good, and super easy just like the title says!  My only complaint is that it doesn't slice very easy.  Maybe with some tweaking, it could work.

I used 2 c brown sugar, 3 c confectioner's sugar & 1 cup peanut butter as recommended by other reviews, and made the best peanut butter fudge I've ever tasted! I made it as gifts for Christmas last year, and have been requested to make it again this year. Added bonus: even my gluten-free sister can eat this!

I had my first bite while it was still cold...didn't care for the texture.  Listened to my son and let it get to room temp....MUCH better.  First attempt at fudge and I think it turned out pretty great.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Seriously the easiest and most delicious fudge. I get asked for the recipe all the time! 
I make it a dairy free version by substituting the butter with coconut oil and the milk with almond milk.
Delicious!

I ran into the same problem that many others have. The mixture started separating and ended up very crumbly. This probably resulted from heating it for too long, but I would prefer a method that involves a candy thermometer for more accuracy.

Wonderful, I followed everyone else advise on using the 1,2,3 for the ingredient. They were so easy. I did also follow the advise of getting everything prepped before i started. I measured out everything and prepared my pan for it in advance. You have to be fast w it though.

Even though I followed some other reviewers suggestions about less sugar, more peanut butter, it still was too sweet. Next time I will try with only 1 c. powdered sugar and maybe a bit more peanut butter.

Be advised that the 'dough' is very stiff!

I had the same problem another person mentioned here, the mix was runny, so I just added the entire 2lb bag of powdered sugar and it turned out great, and it was my first time ever making fudge.

This was the best recipe. I did put saran wrap in the pan before dumping the mixture, which worked out great when I removed the pb fudge. I also placed the tray in the freezer, making it harden a lot more as I like my fudge on the harder side. Can't wait for the holiday parties. These will be a huge hit!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I had to press it into the pan-it was the consistency of pebbles-and afterwards, it tasted like confectioner's sugar.

Excellent fudge! The first time I made it, it turned out so good and rich! The second time I made it, it didn't turn out that good. I realized that you need to use FRESH ingredients and NOT off-brand peanut butter. Very easy recipe to follow and its so rich, but so so yummy!

I've never had much luck with fudge, but this recipe looked easy so I gave it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was definitely easy.  It came out pretty good, better than any other fudge I've made.  It was kind of dry.  I'm not sure if it was my fault or if that's the way it's supposed to be.  Maybe it was overcooked? (It would be nice to have a candy thermometer temperature to go by instead of just the 2 minutes boiling time suggestion.)

I felt this was waaaaay too sweet, even with the reduction in conf. sugar to 3 cups and brown sugar to 2 cups recommended by other reviewers. On the flip side, this recipe makes an awesome praline sauce and I probably will make that again!

This recipe turned out great after following reviews. Be sure to boil butter, brown sugar & milk for 2 minutes. The first time I made it, it was great. The second time I didn't have stick butter so I measured 1/2 cup and melted in the microwave and forgot to let boil for two minutes. It didn't set up firm. My mistake...I love the recipe though. Thanks for posting.

This was so easy and yummy....I, however didn't realize that I didn't have enough confectioner's sugar. So I used the suggested 2 1/4 brown sugar, the 2 3/4 cups confectioner's sugar that I had and upped the peanut butter to 1 cup. Turned out lovely. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Great and simple!!  I have never had good luck making "good" fudge, but this was awesome!  I made the mistake of not sifting the powdered sugar first, but used a sturdy wisk and vigorously beat out the lumps!  Great way to burn off the calories from the fudge! ;-). Will be a recipe I refer to often!

Amazing fudge!  I have never made peanut butter fudge that turned out before and this was perfect.  I used chunky peanut butter and I think next time I will use natural peanut butter for an even peanuttier taste.  Thanks for the great recipe.

BEST RECIPE EVER!! Came out perfect first try and was asked if I made it all the time (I've never made any type of fudge before)! Was also told by picky dad that it's one of the top 3 he's ever had!  Made three batches within a week because it kept going so fast! LOVE IT!!!

Yummy!  I'm not even a fan of fudge but I made the mistake of licking my fingers :o) I reduced the br. sugar as suggested by others but kept the 3 1/2 c. of (sifted) powdered sugar because I added 1/4 c. of cream cheese.  (At this point who cares about calories, right?)  I think next time I may even add a bit more.

I could not believe how easy this was to make and came out perfect the first time. I increased the peanut butter to 1 cup. Hubby, who waits all year for his mother's peanut butter fudge, loved it and said t was just as good as his mother's.

I really loved this one! I made this twice. The first time, I used margarine and smooth peanut butter. It was good but didnt set as well. The second time, I used real butter and crunchy peanut butter. AWESOME~~~ Will keep this handy for many years to come. highly recommend!

This was my first try at making any type of fudge. I was a bit concerned about the texture since it seemed lumpy/gritty when mixed.  Mixing at a lower speed for longer time seemed to help and it set very well.  The top did have a lot of oil when I spread it in the dish, but I absorbed what I could and that helped. Next time I'd probably reduce the butter since the PB naturally has a lot of oil. I also cut down the sugar and increased the PB based on other suggestions and it was still sweet enough!

Very easy.   used others ratio of 1, 2, 3.  For those who had a hard time dissolving the sugar use powder sugar and not white sugar.  Just follow the recipe and def use a mixer to mix.  Next time I might try melting some chocolate on top.  Very yummy!!!

I've tried many fudge recipes and this one by far the easiest and the best tasting. The one trick is to make sure that you let the brown sugar and milk come to a complete boil before starting the 2 min timer.

can't say enough about this peanut butter fudge! I've made it a million times and love it every time.  I always have all the ingredients in the house which makes it a great thing to make if I only have a few minutes and need to bring something to a friend's house.

I have never tasted peanut butter fudge before, but based on that, this is super sweet.  I cut down the powdered sugar and upped the peanut butter as well.  It tasted like a big hunk of peanut butter icing to me, and didn't ever really harden up as much as i would have liked.  Would be great on cake, but won't be making to eat plain again.

I agree with previous reviewers in that this fudge tastes like a sugar block with barely a bit of peanut butter flavor. Really bland and totally not worth the calories. I wll NOT make this again.

With the less sugar/more peanut butter modification, this was better than most fudge you could buy in a specialty shop.  To DIE for.

This is the best peanut butter fudge I have ever made! It is so simple to make! I also took advice from some of the other reviews and used 1 cup peanut butter, 2 cups brown sugar, and 3 cups powdered sugar!

Mine was pretty grainy.  Maybe it was the peanut butter, or not cooking the butter and brown sugar long enough.  I will try again another time.

I couldn't believe how easy this recipe was! I used half smooth, half chunky peanut butter because that's what I had on hand and it turned out great. I thought at the end it could use some chocolate, so I added a handful of chocolate chips. I will definitely be making this again!

I loved how quick and easy this fudge was to make! I also did the 3-2-1 adjustments as per reviewer suggestions and the flavour was delicious. Of course, given the amount of sugar it is very very sweet, so a small piece is sufficient. My only trouble was a greasy residue that I had to pour off the top after I put the mixture in the pan... however, this oil separation could be due to the fact that I used light peanut butter and not regular. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Love the taste of this fudge! I used the 1,2,3 cup change, but after mixing it all together added some spoonfuls more peanut butter and a pinch of salt to cut down the sweet. I sifted the confectioner's sugar and beat with a wooden spoon. I lined the dish with greaseproof paper. Fudge can be hard (no matter what people say) so here are my tips, bring the sugar up to boil gently don't just crank the heat up the whole time, I timed from when there were bubbles on most of the surface (if that helps), and I started from the center of the mix and worked the sugar in slowly from the outsides of the bowl when using a wooden spoon to stop lumps. If your mix went too hard or to pebbles it may be because you cooked the sugar/butter mix too long, boiling evaporates the water content so you may have to add some back in like others have done. On the flip side if it didn't set you may not have cooked it long enough (too much moisture in the butter mix which has happened to me HEAPS). If the butter separates it could be for the same reason, I'd just dab it off with paper towels. Never refrigerate fudge the sugar melts with all the moisture (hence why you're usually told to keep it in an airtight container.) Good eats has a good episode on this where Alton explains most of this so that might be helpful to watch if you're still stuck

I had no problems with this fudge.  I followed the recipe as written.  After adding the liquid ingredients to the powdered sugar I beat it with an electric mixer until completely smooth.  It did set up fast so it the top was rippled after being poured into my glass dish.  The end result was a wonderful smooth and moist fudge.  Kids loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe for the last two years, both times with the change to the sugar (2 cups brown, 3 cups powdered and 1 cup peanut butter).  It's been a favorite both years.

This fudge was very easy to make and tastes so good.  My husband loves it.  I sifted the powderd sugar to make sure there were no lumps in it.  I also put in a bigger pan so that it wasn't so thick.

This fudge was really good, and easy to make.  Did it right the first time.  Used the suggestions for 1c peanut butter, 2c brown sugar and 3c confectioner's sugar to be easy. Tried to decide 4 or 5 stars, went with 4.  Even though the fudge turned out well, was easy and tasted good, it wasn't "OMG the best fudge ever".  It was "good".

UPDATE: tried recipe again, using measurements in original recipe.  It' now 5 stars.  Best pb fudge.  Went over great at work.  Mmm I can still taste it in my mind.  Awesome recipe, stick to the original recipe, no modifications necessary!

I made the recipe as is and it was okay, but extremely sweet, crumbly after it chilled (which surprised me a bit because the consistency was nowhere near crumbly before I chilled it) but it still turned out melt in your mouth. I wish I did follow the other reviewers advice to get a more creamy fudge. This is a good base recipe to start with, but it definitely needs the adjustments to make it 5 star. Thanks for sharing.

I make Peanut Butter fudge often and though I'd make this recipe for a change from my tried and true.  It had a good taste but was very dry...not creamy.  Try using 2c.sugar, 1/2c.milk (boil 3 min) than add 1 1/3c.peanut butter and 7oz. marshmellow fluff.  This is the best, creamiest recipe you will find and soooo easy!

Didn't have a mixer, tried putting it in the blender & it just sat there, desperately spooned it all & then had to mix it by hand, a couple of wee bits of icing sugar did not mixed in but unbelievably it turned out perfect! Really yummy & a big success,I also followed recommended changes in reviews, will definitely make this again.

Yum!  Took this to my weekly Sunday family dinner and it was a hit! Like other reviews have suggested, I altered amounts to 3 c. confectioner's sugar, 2 c. brown sugar, 1 c. peanut butter. Possibly because it's hot here and I have no AC, but it never really hardened. I let it cool to room temp and then popped it into the fridge and that got it harder.   Still, the mushier consistency is totally worth the yumminess of the fudge!

This fudge recipe was amazing!! The only change i made was I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk, I only did this because I had half a can left I didn't want to waste. This recipe will be in my collection for years to come!!

Quick and easy to make.  I used another reviewers suggestion and used an electric mixer to mix the fugde.  It couldn't have been easier.

I found this recipe to be quick, easy and delicious. I made it prior to reading other reviews and did not have any issues or problems with the original recipe. My family loved it!

This recipe was so simple!  As well, I changed a few things after reading the other comments.  I used 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter and 3 cups powdered sugar.  It is the best peanut butter fudge I have ever eaten!

Absolutely wonderful!!  I'm amazed that many had problems with this recipe!  I did use the 3c Conf. Sugar and 2c Brown sugar cut, which really took a lot of the sweetness down!  As many said, wait until that bubbly boil before starting the 2 minute timer.  I drizzled white chocolate over it (picture on side page) and it was a real hit!  Wonderfully EASY recipe!

As a very experienced cook, I was shocked and disappointed how badly this turned out! I used the proportions others recommended, timed the boil properly, used fresh good ingredients and followed the instructions exactly...so why did my fudge never beat smooth(was a mass of crumbly bits) and then get a greasy layer over it? Won't try this again!

I accidentally purchased low sugar/low sodium peanut butter but decided to use it anyway.  It still turned out great!  My husband said it was the best fudge he'd ever had, and I used to send him fudge from Michigan, the Fudge Capital of the world!  So forget paying $10 a pound for the fancy stuff--just buy some JIF and whip this up in five minutes!

I went with the changes in the review of 3 cups confectioners, 2 cups brown, and 1 cup peanut butter.  Very creamy and easy! Beware though, it is VERY sweet! I start timing at an early boil, before the rolling stage and it comes out perfect.  Lining the pan with Saran wrap is a brilliant idea, and gives the fudge a perfect smooth top.

I followed the recipe the first time and the suggestions the 2nd time.  The suggestions changing the amount os brown sugar, peanut butter and conf. sugar turned out to be the key.  Hint...sift the conf sugar to help with the lumps.

I thought this was a pretty easy recipe. I did what the other's suggested and made the fudge with 2 cups of brown sugar/3 cups of powder sugar with 1 cup of peanut butter.I have never had peanut butter fudge before so i was sure if it turned out right..but texture was good, but I thought it was to sweet. Should I try it with 1 cup brown sugar next time?

I've only tried fudge a few times, and my worst effort turned into a great ice cream syrup.  Anyhow, I was at first scared of this recipe because some said it was lumpy or wouldn't set
I used the suggested changes, and it was perfect!  I used my hand mixer for the final smooth product.  I let it cool for 4 hours and lifted it from the pan with the plastic wrap I poured it on.  Then cut it and let it finish setting.  IT IS DELICIOUS!  No doubt about it.

After reading most of the reviews, I was a little intimidated to make fugde. BUT, I decided to jump in and do it. I followed the recipe to a T, except with the 3c. confectioner's sugar, 2c. brown sugar, and 1 c. p.b. It was very easy, and once I gave up the wooden spoon and broke out the beater, the lumps disappeared and it set up very quickly. The end result? Perfection :)

This was absolutely the best fudge I've ever had! I used 2 cups of brown sugar instead, half & half instead, and 3 cups of confectioners sugar.
My 29 old big brother died in an accident on Christmas.  He loved peanut butter.  I have been craving peanut butter ever since he passed even though before I ate it occasionally. I made this recipe for Mother's Day, and my mom told me that my father's (who passed away when I was 3) favorite desert was peanut butter fudge.  She gave me his handwritten recipe and it was so special.

Great recipe. I followed the recipe all the way. I think why people were having problems with this recipe was that they were not using powdered sugar. Some people don't know what confectioners sugar is. But this is the best Recipe. Loved it. Thanks

This was so easy to make!  I have never made any kind of fudge so I was extremely surprised at how quick and easy it was.  Also the fudge came out perfect! Nice texture and great taste.  Will be making this again and again!  I followed others advice and used 1 c. peanut butter, 2 c. brown sugar, and 3 c. confec. sugar. ENJOY!

DEBMILLIKAN - next time, try using a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients.  The metal beaters won't mix as well as a wooden spoon.  That would account for why your fudge came out pebbly.

I have to say I was very skeptical of this recipe, as I'm from the "candy thermometer" school of thought.  However, I followed other reviewers' suggestions in modifying the amounts of powdered sugar and peanut butter.  This turned out perfectly, the first time.  This will become my new "standard" for PB fudge.  I gave some as gifts for Christmas; one of the recipients has already asked me to make more!! :-)

This recipe is just too-o-o-o easy.  It came out perfect and this was my first try.  I, too, used the modifications of 1 cup p.b., 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups conf. sugar.  Can't imagine it being any better.

Have tried in the past to make p.b. fudge was never able to do. TILL NOW !!! Awesome recipe. 1st batch used 1 cup milk by mistake,(didn't harden but ate it anyway). 2nd batch came out perfect(used chunky p.b.)Just made my 3rd batch,used regular white sugar, came out perfect for that grainy texture real sugar lovers like. Also used 2c br sugar,1c P.B. and 3c confct./and or white sugar. Simply put the best ever tasted home made/ or store bought.

Wonderful and EASY and Quick!!!  I made them as others suggested with 3C powdered sugar and 2 C brown sugar and 1 C peanut butter.  I used a hand mixer instead of an electric mixer.  An electric mixer would be much easier!!!  
I tripled the recipe and it fit perfectly in a rectangular metal baking pan, maybe 13 by 9?

This fudge was delicious!!! I'm a huge peanut butter fan and have been searching for a great recipe like this.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and I used 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter and 3 cups confectioners sugar.  It was perfect!!  The texture was not hard but not too soft and the flavor was very rich but not too sweet.

Thanks to all the reviews, I too made a few adjustments.  I used 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 cup of all natural peanut butter and 3 cups confectioners sugar.  When I beat it in the bowl, the mixture started to crumble, so I think it had something to do with the all natural peanut butter, I simply put it all in the pan, and used butter spray on the back of a spatula and pressed all the crumbs in the pan.  The next day, I cut it into squares and it was perfect.  My guests all loved it--I will be giving some out for Christmas gifts this year...thanks Angie!

I followed the recipe exactly as well.  But it nevered beat into the sugar, just got all 'doughy' like cookie dough.  I pressed into the pan and the grease just rose to the top.  Perhaps I cooked the sugar too long???

Because of it's name "easiest peanut butter fudge" and it is, and because it is a pretty good likeness to peanut butter fudge I give it 5 stars.  My grandkids will have fun making this and eating it too.  In a pinch I will make it again, but true, really good peanut butter fudge is cooked and takes a lot more time.  Thanks for the recipe Angie.

This recipe was so easy and turned out fabulous. I also used 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioners sugar, and 1 cup peanut butter. At first it seemed a little greasy but then after it cooled it was perfect. I'll keep this one on file for a while. Thanks for the recipe!

This did not work for me. Should have read the other reviews first and adjusted the ingredients as mine came out dried and cracked. Was not able to serve it. the flavor was ok to will try it again w/adjustments.

This is the best fudge ever!  I received many compliments.  Also, I did make the recommended changes - 2 cups of brown sugar, 3 cups confectioner's sugar, and 1 cup peanut butter.  I am considering changing the size of the pan to 9 X 13 the next time I make it b/c the fudge was really thick.  I love this candy.

This was very good and couldn't have been easier to make.  This was my first time making peanut butter fudge and I don't know why I waited so long to try it.

Refrigerated peanut butter is most likely the cause of some of the mishaps listed.  Make sure your peanut butter is room temperature.

I used 3C confectioners sugar, 1C peanut butter & 2C brown sugar (as others suggested), and margarine instead of butter, my consistency was perfect, I just had to mix by hand.

I followed the alterations of 2c. b.sugar, 3 cups pow. sugar, and 1 cup PB and the fudge turned put great! It's creamy, smooth, very peanut buttery, and a nice hint of brown sugar. Delicious! I halved mine, and it still turned out great. Definitely a keeper!

Very easy and very tasty. I took the other reviewers' recommendations and they came out beautifully...just like fudge you'd find at any gourmet candy shop.

I used the recommendations because I didn't want to be too sweet with the additions I used. When removed from heat, I added several chunks of reeseS peanut butter cups. I should have folded them in- rather than beating them in!! Now it's got little bumps in it..  After making the fudge I covered it with a chocolate layer on top. The instructions are sooo easy as well as the ingrediants. THANK YOU!!!!! After all these reviews, it's no suprize that everyone loved this!! Although they wanted more chocolate..lol of course!!

This was good, but definitely cut down on the confectioner's suger - it is way too much.  I would recommend using 1/2 cup less than the recipe calls for.  Otherwise, this recipe was amazing.

Easy and very good.  I stirred in semi sweet chocolate chips when it was slightly cooled which added a nice chocolate swirl.  This made a nice item for holiday gifts.

This is the absolute best peanut butter fudge recipe.  I usually buy the fudge to take to holiday parties, but I saw this recipe and decided to try it.  It only took about 10 minutes to make, and I chilled it for about 2 hours and it was perfect.  Many compliments from everyone at work, and they are picky!! I prepared the recipe exactly as it reads, and it turned out so creamy, with the perfect amount of sweetness and peanut butter taste!! A+++

I cannot stress how awesome this fudge is. I HATE flaky fudge and this is NOT! It is VERY creamy. Follow the directions EXACTLY! Every time I make this, people always ask me for the recipe and they can't believe how easy it is. AWESOME recipe!

Fabulous - several people remarked that it was the best fudge they'd ever had, and they just knew I had bought it from a shop instead of making it at home.  And so easy!

This was good, but the peanut butter flavor did not really stand out.  The texture is nice and the flavor is better than ok, but I'll keep looking for another recipe.  Does anyone know if it could have been because i used a natural peanut butter?

I followed people's directions to lessen the sugar and use more PB, It turned out wonderful!  I am still partial to the marshmallow creme fudge versions but this was very good!

I made this for a bake sale. I cut up some tiny bites for samples. The first person to taste it ended up buying the entire plate of fudge! I also took other reviewers advice and changed the amounts for the sugars. I will be making this many times in the future.

The first time I made this recipe it wouldn't set up properly. It was sweet though and it actually had a beautiful color and texture. I added marshmallows the second time and I followed Aunt Teeny's Creamy Chocolate Fudge as far as ingredients are concerned (exceptfor the chocolate) and I followed the cooking directions exactly stated and that corrected this recipe and then I had a great peanut butter fudge that set up. Ummmmmmmmm! Now it's good!

This fudge was AMAZING!!! I have heard that most people fail with fudge their first time, but this was my first time ever making it, and no joke, it was too amazing.  So good, it was really creamy, not grainy at all. very, very good. STRONGLY recommended.

This was really simple, and really delicious. I followed the previous suggestions - 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups powdered sugar and 1 cup peanut butter. I brought it with me into work this morning and everyone loved it. One of my coworkers even said, "I think this is the best peanut butter fudge I've ever had!"

I had never had (or even heard of, for that matter) peanut butter fudge. This recipe is terrific! Don't need to change a thing! :)

Really good fudge. I doubled the recipe so if you do that make sure you have a really big bowl to do it in.

I cannot make chocolate fudge to save my life, but this is the easiest, BEST tasting p.b. fudge I have ever had!  Everyone loves it and asks for it at Crhistmas!  It's fabulous!

I've decided that this is actually a great "diet food".  Anytime you've got a hankering for something sweet, just shave a small sliver off this fudge and let it melt in your mouth.  You're sweet tooth will be more than satisified.  This fudge was tasty, and was a great Christmas treat to add to gift plates of cookies.  Thank for sharing the recipe.

The very first fudge I have ever made that not only turned out resembling fudge but it was edible too!  I thought it might not turn out, especially since I used soft-spread margerine and no salt/no sugar peanut butter AND was making dinner at the same time - but its perfect!

This recipe was very easy to make, but I really disliked the results. It was way too sweet, even with the reduced sugars. My boyfriend wouldn't even eat more than a small piece and all he eats are sweets. I ended up throwing out 95 percent of the batch.

Oh my goddddd. Someone come over & eat the rest of my pan of this for me! I can't stop eating it. I'm going to gain 294829842 pounds. This was SO easy to make. It set completely in like... an hour. You can eat it before then, but I like my fudge firmer than not. It is addicting, so watch out.

This is the ultimate fudge recipe!  This tastes like my aunt's recipe...which was what I was hoping for.  Soooo easy and sooooo good!  I reduced the amount of sugar as recommended and it came out perfect.  I was ecstatic considering this was my first time making fudge.  My daughters and I love this fudge!

4.27.05 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22724/easiest-peanut-butter-fudge/ ... With suggested changes: 1 cup peanut buter, 2 cups brown sugar & 3 cups confec sugar, this was good.  It was greasy at first, but set up fine.  I overcooked it, thinking of how other fudge recipe directions are.  I'll try it again following the directions better.  Maybe the grease (butter) problem was a product of overcooking.  Eventhough it was crumbly, it was still good.  :@  :D

Excellent flavor! The secret to this fudge is not packing down your powdered sugar so very hard! Use best quality peanut butter and real butter! It is worth the expense for fudge this rich! Wonderful!

I have a major sweet tooth, but this was too sweet to enjoy and I could barely taste the peanut butter flavor.  Even thinking about it makes me feel sick. If you want to make this, do yourself a favor and cut down the sugar and increase the PB. I am very disappointed. :(

Hi Angie,This is the best and I do mean best. Last night I was readind the reviews and thought this recipe can't be as good and easy as everyone say's. I checked out the negative responses and had to find out for myself, I made it late last night and it was absolutely delicious, no problem at all it did not match the negative review's. I sifted my powdered sugar, did not pack the brown sugar as most recipe's call for, adjusted my sugar as suggested and made sure my burner was a low medium and made sure it was at a full boil for two min. Today I made it again and added a cup of choc. chips with the peanut butter. It is a winner, thank you so much.  TASU

Delicious - I have made it several times and always receive rave reviews. People can't believe how quick and easy it is. After the fudge cools, I microwave about 1 cup of Nestle Peanut Butter & Milk Chocolate chips and spread them over the top. I also reduced the brown sugar to 2 cups and the confectioner's sugar to 3 cups because it was too sweet. I increased the peanut butter to 1 cup.

A bit strong on the brown sugar taste, and dry.  This definitely did not "pour" into the pan, had to scrape it out of the bowl and press it down because it was so crumbly.

Great, easy recipe!  However, it wasn't as smooth and creamy as I had hoped (a little dry).  But for how easy and fast it was, you can't complain too much. Chopped peanuts are great in it as well.  I will make this again, although I am going to try a few more recipes.

This was my first time making peanut butter fudge and this turned out very good.  It was just a tad bit sweet for my taste.  So, I might cut back on the confectioners next time.  Thanks so much for sharing Angie.

My first attempt at this and it came out GREAT! I did as suggested and increased the peanut butter to one cup. It was a snap to make and came out very creamy and peanutty. Will be the only peanut butter fudge I will ever make...thanks!

This was so yummy!  This was my first attempt at making fudge ever.  The recipe looked too simple to be true, but it came out fantastic.  My family said they will never buy fudge from those fudge stores again when I can make it better (and for cheaper!).  Per someone elses suggestion, I changed the recipe to be 4 tablesppons of brown sugar and that was great!  I did not sift the powder sugar before, and it still came out great!  Now I have to figure out how to make choc. peanut butter fudge!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

OH MY GOSH, This is a wonderful recipe. I've never made peanut butter fudge before. This was very easy and tasted great. I liked it better than the chocolate fudge I made. I took it to work and it was the first to go. I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. Cece

This was easy and very good! Good if you have a sweet tooth and like peanut butter. I also put melted chocolate on top of my fudge and it was good that way too.

This was sooo simple to make. The only complaints I have was it is too sweet to have a medium sized peice...just itty bitty pieces. Second...not enought peanut butter in my opinion. I will definitely make this again, just with more peanut butter and less sugar!!

I made this and like other reviews I used 1 cup of peanut butter 3 cups of confectioners sugar and 2 cups of brown sugar. I started timing as soon as it boiled  Followed the directions and used a hand mixer to cream it all together. It was great. Will definitely make again

I made it both ways. First batch following the recipe and the second with the increased peanut butter and decreased sugar. Both were devoured but the second everyone agreed was better. It  did taste more like peanut  butter, but the consistency was better too. It came out thicker and easier to remove from the pan. For those who think it's too sweet remember it's still FUDGE lol.

I cannot believe this got such good reviews. It was awful! Did not taste like peanut butter at all. Just sugar, sugar, sugar. It also was so crumbly. Not smooth at all. I have never given a bad review on this site but this had to be said. Find another recipe. The other one I found was delicious.

I used less powdered sugar because it seemed like A LOT. Even with only using 2 of the 3.5 cups it calls for, it still tastes of nothing but powder sugar. Very disappointing.

I used 2 cups light brown sugar, 1 cup Jif chunky peanut butter & 3 cups powdered sugar, also suggested by others.  After stirring the peanut butter into the brown sugar mixture, I poured it into my mixing bowl, then added the powdered sugar, beating until thoroughly blended.  Pressed it into an 8"x 8" Pyrex baking dish & covered w/plastic.  *Also note:  When boiling for 2 minutes, bring it to a "HARD, ROLLING BOIL" before starting to time it for the 2 minutes.  VERY Good:)

I did as other reviewers suggested and went with 1c peanut butter, 2c brown sugar, & 3c powdered sugar. I also used vanilla almond milk, (because its what I had) so I omitted the vanilla.  I have made this several times, a few times I tossed in some homemade marshmallows (Alton Brown's) those batches were lighter in color, and everyone who didn't see me cook it said that  it tasted different, but they weren't sure how... It still tasted good.  Delicious actually, but the marshmallows did make a difference ;) thank you for this recipe :) will be made for years to come :)

Having read a lot of the previous reviews, I used 2 C. brown sugar, 3 C. confectioner's, and 1 C. peanut butter. It was EXCELLENT. (Copied from another review.)  I like this version of the recipe as it has more of a peanut butter taste. Also, if a little oil is on top of the candy after you have poured it, just dab it off with a paper towel.  It will be fine.

This is a great peanut butter fudge and is the perfect consistency!!! I love it and my family loves it! Another thing I tried was a chocolate ganache on top and that was a good addition. Just an idea. :-)

This was my first attempt at fudge so I thought I would try a recipe that appeared easy enough for a newbie. I tried suggestions from other posters and this recipe came out a crumbly, greasy mess. So disappointed.

I make a lot of candy and fudge for others especially over the holidays, I had some requests for PB fudge. I'm no fan of PB in any form but reluctantly agreed to make some.  I too followed the other reviewers with the adjustments in Brown sugar, Confec. sugar and PB. I always sift my confec. sugar when I use it which may help keep the fudge from getting pebbly as some reviews pointed out.  anyway, the recipe worked great, everyone absolutely loved it!  It was firm, smooth, creamy etc.  Even I thought it was good for being PB!

 I did measure my temp with my digital candy thermometer as it boiled, it came in right at 224 degrees ( here in Denver) when my 2 minutes where up, same as most all other fudge I make, this might help others seeing some were posting that they were having issues with when to start timing of boil, which could lead to a nasty loose mess or harder than wanted consistency.   Remember to adjust temp 2 degrees less for every 1000' in altitude you are above sea level.  SL = 234degrees.   Hopes this helps and keeps things consistent.  Best!

FINALLY after years of NOT being able to get fudge to turn out right I have a recipe that actually worked out AND tasted good. Thank you... I can do just about anything when it comes to cooking,baking,cake decorating,sugar work, and even some candy, but fudge was my nemesis. I may try some of the suggestions from others at another time.....BUT TONIGHT WE CELEBRATE AND EAT FUDGE!!!!! Thanks again...(pic later)

I've made this twice. First, I followed the directions exactly and everyone loved it but I felt it was too sweet. Then I followed what some of the other reviewers wrote about reducing brown sugar to 2 cups, and increasing the peanut butter to 1 cup and decreasing the powdered sugar to 3 cups. I have to say the 2nd batch was HEAVEN!

I used my mixer to blend, the sugar incorporated well, but it never became "smooth", even after 5 minutes of beating. It was just a bowl of pebbles basically. I thought I'd go ahead and press it into the pan anyways to see what would happen. Oh MAN! What a disaster. The butter FLOATED to the top!!

Apparently I did something wrong as well as one other person. I followed the instructions as they were, and once I poured the mixture into the bowl with the confectioner sugar, it became very lumpy and never smooth. I tried adding more butter which I know spiked the calories even more, but I did not know what else to do being in a hurry before it became more stiff than it was already starting to get. I then picked up my mixture by hand, layed it in the casserole dish, then mashed it down to form a nice even square. I usually have good turn outs with every recipe I have tried on this site, but unfortunatly, I did not have luck with this one.

I did everything exactly the way it said it and when I poured the mixture into the sugar, the sugar asorbed the liquid so like that left little pebble things instead of like a paste so I mixed just plain milk into it and it thinned it out into a paste and I put it in the fridge and it turned our perfect and it didn't take long at all

i've just put mine in the fridge to chill-- but, i didnt have more than about 3/4 cup brown sugar so i used white sugar. a little taste test while it was warm turned out great! however, it's way too sweet even for my liking (and let me tell you, i am big on sweets.)

Excellent & very creamy! I followed the suggestions of others & cut the brown sugar to 2c & the powdered sugar to 3c. I upped the peanut butter to a cup as suggested & may try 1 1/4c next time. I saw differing opinions on when to start the 2 minute boiling time so I   split the difference & started before it reached a rolling boil. I also added the powdered sugar to the mixture which I had put in my stand mixer. I set it on low speed for a minute or two.

This recipe is delish! I'm a serious peanut butter lover and I make it almost once a week, which is bad for my waistline but excellent for my tastebuds. I reduced the brown sugar to 2 cups, increased the peanut butter to 1 cup, and reduced the powdered sugar to 3 cups. I also put it into a 9x13in pan. It takes too long to cool in a smaller dish, and you still end up with a thick, hearty fudge from the bigger dish. Love, love, love this fudge!

I made this for the second time today!!  I grew up on my Grandmothers fudge, but have never been able to come anywhere to close to making it as good as hers.  In fact, I've always had a hard time getting my fudge to set.  It turned out perfectly the first time, per exact recipe.  This time I used a whole cup of peanut butter, for a little added flavor, and it turned out amazing again!!  
This recipe is unbelievably easy!!  I will probably be able to make it from memory the next time.    In my opinion, the best way to make this is to have everything measured out and ready to go before you start melting the butter!

I made this recipe for the first time for Christmas.  My family members tend to be "food critics" with anything new, so I wasn't expecting much.  They loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly (except for garnishment)and although I read some reviews that stated it was too sweet, I didn't think it was - as long as the pieces were cut into about 1 inch cubes.  I sprinkled edible gold glitter on the top - looked very festive.  I will definitely make this again.

This was my first attempt at peanut butter fudge and I too took the advice of most reviewers using 2 C. Brown sugar 1 C. peanut butter, and 3 C. confectioners sugar. The fudge was crumbly and never smooth, but I pressed the mess into a wax papered lined 8x8 and allowed to cool. It appears crumbly is okay as the fudge was excellent. I received many compliments. The alterations made a 5 star recipe.

I had never, ever made fudge before, and peanut butter fudge is my husband's favorite. I decided to try this for Christmas. My husband said, "I think it's really hard," and "No matter how it turns out, I appreciate the effort." He LOVED it, and so did I. I of course never told him how easy it was. We were getting ready to move and I had packed all my 8 x 8 pans, so I doubled the recipe and used a 13 x 9. The only thing I changed was that I used 2 cups of peanut butter instead of 1 1/2. The only recommendation I have is to MOVE QUICKLY! Pre-measure everything so that it doesn't boil over or cool while you're measuring,

My mother makes a tin of peanut butter fudge for me every Christmas because it's my favorite and I like to
add it to gift bags. She was over-extended this holiday so I figured it was time I learned to make my own. Followed the recipe as written and it turned out perfectly. Wonderful texture and just the right amount of peanut butter taste.   I like mine better than mom's!

Easy to make and extremely delicious! I have made these 3 times and everyone loves them! I recommend using 1 cup peanut butter, though. :)

Great recipe, super easy.  Used the recommendation to use 2 cups brown, 3 cups confection and 1 cup PB. It is still a very sweet fudge, but my southern-bred, sweet-toothed hubby says thats the way it is supposed to be.  He loves it. Thanks!

I guess I should have read the reviews first. Followed exactly and got dry, crumbly, too sweet.

Follow the majority of the reviews , and change the amounts of pb and sugar, and you won't be disappointed ! I have been making my poppops chocolate fudge recipe for years, and decided to add some peanut butter fudge this Christmas . I never saw a fudge recipe without fluff before , and I was skeptical , but this is creamy and yummy! I mixed it with my kitchen aid and added chocolate chips to it! I read a review that said not to refridgerate it, but we had no issue putting it in there. Very easy and very good!!

I've always wanted to make peanut butter fudge, so I found this recipe. I made it for my church's Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone loved it; than I took it to my employees, and it was gone with a half hour. This had to be the best recipe I've ever made. Everyone thought it was the best fudge they ever had.

Fabulous! I also changed the proportions to 2 c brown sugar, 3 c confectioners sugar and 1 c peanut butter.  I used super chunky PB, since that was all I had in the house.  And then, I also mixed in a large handful of chocolate chips because who doesn't love chocolate chips?!? And lastly, I ended up putting it into a 9" square pan, not 8". Everyone's reviews said this fudge was very sweet, so I thought slightly thinner pieces wouldn't be a bad thing...  And I was right! Yum! I will definitely make this again?

In the end, I could eat it, cause I added butter to what seemed to be a VERY crumbly looking sugar mixture. Thanks.

Made this recipe with no alterations.
It looked like fudge, but this did not taste like nor have the consistency of fudge. I cut them into really small squares, after the family had one square it wasn't touched again.

Made this as others recommended with 1 C PB, 3 C powder sugar, and 2 C brown sugar.  Turned out firm/creamy (perfect!) but would like more PB taste.  I will attempt again with more PB and even less powder sugar....

Also used the tweaked recipe (1C peanut butter, 3C Con. sugar, 2C brown), and it came out perfectly! Very rich, so the amount goes a long ways.

I followed Connieluna's hints, and found if it did turn out too grainy to just add a little milk and stir. Came out perfect and now I make it at every work related pot-luck and it's gone by the end of the day! Big hit with my co-workers which slightly benefits me :D

I took everyone's suggestions and used 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioner's sugar, and 1 cup of peanut butter. I also used 2 tsp vanilla instead of 1 tsp. This was the best fudge I ever made. I felt guilty for eating so much fudge but it was so yummy I couldn't resist!

These were part of an overall birthday fudge pack i gave as presents to a few people.  i dipped about half of the PB fudge i made in semisweet chocolate.  They were a great hit, tasted great.  I used the suggestions in the reviews for 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup PB, et cetera.

I improvised some considering the advice of others. 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioners sugar, 1/2 cup evaporated milk, and 1 1/4 cups peanut butter. I timed for two minutes from the time I saw it beginning to boil. AWESOME!!!

To DebMillikan   Mine too was pebbly and dry so I added a little more milk, a tablespoon at a time.  Im not sure exactly how much extra milk I used as I did it bit by bit but I'm guessing about4 or 5 tablespoons.  That solved the problem.

By far the best peanut butter fudge recipe I've ever tried. Turns out perfectly every time and is a hit with everyone who tries it. However, I tried the alteration a lot of people were suggesting (2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 3 cups confectioner's sugar) and I don't like it. Still tastes delicious but doesn't mix very smooth and has to be really pressed into the pan rather than poured. I'll be sticking with the origininal.

I followed what others said and added 1 c. peanut butter and less powdered sugar and more brown sugar and it was still very sweet, almost too sweet and I like sweet. I think next time if I try this again I will add 1.5 c of peanut butter and even less powdered sugar.

I love this recipe its as quick and easy as they say. I used the 2 cups of brown sugar, 3 cups confectioner's sugar, and 1 cup peanut butter version everyone mentions. I think the brown sugar is what makes the big difference. This recipe will go in the family hand down list for sure.

GREAT Recipe! This is super easy and tastes fantastic. I used 1 cup of peanut butter and threw in a few handfuls of semisweet chocolate chips when I mixed in the peanut butter. Gave it a hint of chocolate! I used about 3 cups confectioners sugar also. I'd recommend maybe sifting in the powdered sugar as mine did have 'lumps' even after mixing it for a while. That certainly didnt affect the taste - it just looks like we used chunky peanut butter. Its even a great color!I sprayed my pan w/non-stick spray and it came out with no problems.

this is a great recipe and there have been some good reviews and suggestions i agree with.  I too added a cup of peanut butter instead of 3/4c, because really...more can't hurt.  I too used an electric mixer after adding the peanut butter, to help smooth in the confectioner's sugar into the mixture...but here is my own addition to make this more sinful then it is:after mixing it all together and before i put it in the saran wrapped lined pan (also suggested by someone) i took the liberty of adding a package of Reese mini peanut butter cups.  It became a whole new level of peanut butter heaven.  It was a hit. love it. don't hold back the love on the peanut butter...get crazy with it...add the mini cups you won't regret it.  lol

I made this and it was excellent.  It melts in your mouth. I was so proud of it I made everyone try it and they loved it too.  It will now be a holiday tradition in my family.

This is a great tasting and easy fudge recipe.  I have never had issues with it not turning out perfect every time.

I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday and she loved it. Everyone raved about it! At first mine came out like pebbles even when I kept mixing. Then I added milk, a little at a time, and continued blending and the fudge got creamy and smooth. Excellent recipe. I'm already working on my second batch!

I love this fudge.  Almost a soft, chewy texture which I love about fudge.  I used reviewer suggestions with 1 cup peanut butter, 2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups of conf. sugar.

I made this fudge twice with unsalted butter and it came out good. The third time I only had salted butter and I could tell something was wrong before I added the milk. In the end it came out like Debmillken stated with butter rise to top, pebbles in mixing bowl. I don't know really what I did wrong, scorched the butter maybe?

I thought this was a the recipe I tried a while back that we really enjoyed. This was just ok, didn't harden properly, I followed directions to a "T". Will continue to try new recipes.

I ran out of brown sugar, so I used 1 and 3/4 brown sugar, and 1/2 cup pancake syrup.  I also used evaporated milk instead of regular.  It gave the fudge more of a unique homemade caramel flavor.

This recipe was so easy and really good.  After reading reviews, I also modified the recipe with a bit less sugar and more peanut butter.  I also was running really low on vanilla.  My batch is really creamy but not disgustingly sweet.  Would definitely use this again.

I made the recipe with a scant 2 cups brown sugar, 1 heaping cup of peanut butter, and 3 scant cups powdered sugar.  I don't like dry, crumbly fudge so I didn't put it in the refrigerator.  A day later it is still soft and creamy, with texture and taste just like the fudge in Mackinac!  AWESOME!

I would like to give this recipe 5 stars but since I used an altered version recommended by another reviewer, I have to give this 4.5 stars. The end result was absolutely delicious. It's the first time that I have made fudge.

The taste was pretty good, but the texture was greasy and grainy and I followed the recipe very precisely. I didn't use cake flour as others suggested since it is so expensive, but perhaps that would've helped. We ended up throwing it all away. Such a waste and a disappointment as I really wanted my husband to enjoy this Christmas treat!

The flavor is wonderful, not too rich. My rating is based on the the fact that I tried this twice following the recipe exactly and it turns into little beads, then I have to kneed it to get it to stick together and press it in to a pan very firmly.

I followed the 3 2 1 sugg of the other reviewers and the directions. While it was good, it was waaaaaaaay too sweet! And it never really got too firm. Was still soft.

Very good for a quick and easy fudge recipe!  It was obviously not as good as the real thing, but it was a LOT less work too.  This was delicious, and my family loved every last bite.  Make sure you wrap it up well after you make, because it dries out very quickly, and gets hard and crumbly within a few days.

easy and not bad, i think the brown sugar gives it too much of a butterscotch taste for peanutbutter fudge and a little too creamy. peanut butter fudge should be a little dry. wont make this again since my husband is the pb fudge lover and he didnt like it.

Okay, had to give it 3 because I decided to follow the advice of everyone and use 3,2,1. I have no idea how I did it, but mine tastes and has the same consistency as peanut butter blossom dough, and is extremely soft. EXTREMELY soft. No eggs or flour required. It's so similar, I'm almost tempted(almost, I know better) to bake a piece and see what happens :/ lol. I don't know if I overboiled or underboiled but it passed the soft ball stage test and stayed that way. It holds it's shape, but barely.

This is a very good fudge recipe, me and my wife made it, but being i'm newly diabetic, we put a diabetic's twist to it., I took the advice of the other reveiwers and used 2 cups of Ideal brown sugar substitute (Xylitol, maltodextrin, molasses, & sucralose) and 3 cups of Ideal confectionery sugar substitute (Xylitol, maltodextrin, corn starch, sucralose),and being xylitol does asorb liquids, I added a little extra milk (about 1-2 tsp). even diabetics can enjoy the good life  without having that nasty tasting nutra-sweet/aspertame after taste. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great! It is very easy and tastes like you bought it from a candy store. I did add 3/4 Cups of pecans to counter some of the sweetness. Excellent recipe.

I followed others advice and opted to 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 3 cups powder sugar. This came out great. I started the 2 min boil at the first sign of bubbles. I would strongly suggest using a stand-up electric mixer for the final step. Crank it up high and it will remove all the powder sugar lumps.

I make this once a week for the kids, box it for Christmas, take to family gatherings and fancy it up for parties. I've even added oatmeal or chowmein noodles for no bake cookies. Everyone always raves about how wonderful they are. I use chunky peanut butter and a little extra vanilla. You are limited only by your imagination....or lack there of. :)

Yes, it is real sweet.  And I cut the brown sugar down to 2 cups.  Also sifted the powdered sugar to prevent lumps.  I was afraid it would not work out since sifting might change the measurements, but it worked fine.  I agree with other reviewers that it could use more pnut butter taste.  Might try to add more next time.  Thanks Angie, Susie

As long as you go by the previous reviews and do 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioners sugar, and 1 cup peanut butter this recipe is delicious!! My family loved it and are already begging me to make more!

I can't believe how fast and easy this recipe is without losing quality. I get so excited over recipes like this. The only thing I would suggest is when mixing in the confectioners sugar, you must be quick because the mixture will cool so fast, making the mixture too dry and hard to pour. If this happens just add more butter or peanut butter over low heat, stirring constantly.

This is wonderful!  I read some of the other reviews and also only used 2 cups of brown sugar and 3 cups of confectioners sugar.  I also increased the peanut butter to 1 cup.  Everyone that has tried it LOVES it!

I am a baker and thought I would give this a shot because the simple ingredients and recipe. WAY WAY to sweet, powdery. This recipe was like eating the center of a buckeye that had way to much confectioners sugar.If you want something extremey sweet not much luck on regular fudeg. try it.

This is the 1st time I've made fudge. Yummy! I took advice of some and put in more PB and less sugar. I used organic so it's a tiny bit soft. (only been in fridge for 1 hr so it may firm up more)I also added a square of baking chocolate. Can't wait for my hubby to try it! Peanut butter is one of his favorite things :)

just made this recipe and adjusted the sugar amount like some other reviewers suggested.  Have not had a chance to try it other than licking the spoon! ;) but from what I tasted it will be good!!! No gritty feeling or taste that I could tell.  I also added a top layer of chocolate fudge!! Will come back and give stars after "official" taste test! :)

Delicious! I'dnever made fudge before and this this was truly simple! As others suggested, I increasee PB to 1Cup, decreased b sugar to 2 cups, and decreased powdered sugar to 3 cups. Once the mixture got to a high rolling boil, I removed it from the heat. Very simple and VERY delicious. Even my husband likes it and he's a tough one to please!

I have no idea what I did wrong, I followed the recipe exactly. But it turned out very dark and crumbly (it looked like cooked ground beef), and did not have much of a peanut buttery taste. I used dark brown sugar, so maybe that can account for the dark color?? I am supposed to be taking this to someone tomorrow as a holiday gift, so I'm going to stay up tonight and try another batch.  Okay, after the first batch turned out so horrible, I adjusted the recipe some. I used 2 loose cups of brown sugar and added 2 extra tablespoons of milk. I used 1 and 1/3 cup of peanut butter, and took the powdered sugar down to 2 and 1/4 cups. It turned out sooo much better!!!! I would give the adjusted recipe 4 stars :-D

As another recent poster stated, I also followed the directions exactly and also came out with a bowl full of crumbles or "pebbles."  It never got creamy and when I squeezed a bit between my fingers, it did seem oily.  It reminds me of peanut butter cup filling (in a way).

Yum!  This was my first attempt at making fudge and it turned out perfectly.  I did as other reviews suggested and used 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 cup of peanut butter and 3 cups of confectioners sugar.  I also lined the bottom of the dish with plastic wrap so that it made a nice smooth finish and was super easy to remove from the pan and then be cut into squares.  Can't wait to make this again.  It is very sweet...but it's fudge!  I may try it with natural peanut butter (no sugar added) next time.  Definitely a keeper!

Not the best I have had, but not the worst either.  It was very simple and easy though, so was good for the time it took.

I too, had some issues with this fudge.  I tried the exact recipe 3 times and it came out dry every time...the taste was wonderful, but very dry.  I took the advice of some of the previous reviews and have changed it to 2C brown sugar, 3C confectioner's sugar and 1C peanut butter.  Rave reviews from this change...thanks everyone for the input.

I made this along with some other types of fudge as a Christmas gift for several people last year. It was so popular that I'm already getting requests for it this year - not for the other kinds, just this one!

This is one of the easiest, creamiest PB Fudge recipes I have ever made as well as the most crowd pleasing. I did add one additional ingredient, Chocolate Cheerios. . . after spreading the fudge in the bottom of a prepared pan I folded in about a cup and a half of Chocolate Cheerios. What a hit with kids as well as my husband. I will try  PB cups quartered  next time! Thanks for the recipe!

Way too sweet and does not taste enough like peanut butter.  Consistancy was a little firm but I think that was more me and not the recipe.  Will try a different recipe next time.

This is my favorite recipe. It works so well. I find it hardens best if I let it chill for a hour then cut it into squares and let it chill another hour. This is also a great recipe for maple fudge, all you have to do is replace the peanut butter with 3/4 tsp of maple flavoring.

I followed recommendations to reduce the sugar and increase the peanut butter, but the final product still tasted more like sugar than peanut butter.
I salvaged the fudge by cutting into small cubes and rolling in unsweetened cocoa powder.  The bitterness of the powder offsets the sweetness and actually allows the flavor of the peanut butter to come through.

So so so good and super easy. This was my first attempt at fudge and I will definitely be making this again and will probably try variations of this recipe. I did follow other users suggestions and used 2 c. brown sugar, 1 c. peanut butter, and 3 c. confectioner's sugar. It worked out great!

This is a pretty good peanut butter fudge recipe. It beats waiting until soft ball stage. One thing I must let everyone know: If you get a craving for peanut butter fudge but don't have enough powdered sugar to make this recipe.... just go to the store or wait. I tried making powdered sugar in the blender and this recipe did not come out the same at all. When I make it with store-bought powdered sugar it comes out perfectly.

I give this a 3 more because of my husband than me.  I couldn't eat this.  It's so sweet that it just made me cringe with the first bite.  My husband said "I could eat this but its not great."  We both agree that its just basically a sugar square with a hint of peanut butter.  I think a couple of these squares have nothing on a Red Bull! We're both peanut butter lovers and that didn't sit too well with us that you can't really taste it that much.  I will not bother tinkering with this again.  My quest for a great peanut butter fudge continues...

Loved it!  Super easy and super good.  I was so glad to find a recipe for PB fudge that didn't require a candy thermometer, and when I tasted the finished product and it tasted good enough to pass for something bought from a fudge shop I was thrilled.  And if it lasts long enough that you have some left over it freezes well.

I was craving some peanut butter fudge and I found this recipe. I followed the other peoples suggestions of the 3-2-1 change and it turned out perfectly. First time making it too. Five stars, this stuff is AWESOME.

This recipe saved Christmas eve for us! My daughter brought home a different peanut butter fudge recipe that ended up flopping. We looked up this one and made it quickly with no problems. We'll be making this from now on, thanks.

I think I added too much peanut butter because when I mixed everything together it was very thick, like a cookie dough.  So I added a little milk and, viola, creamy delicious pb fudge!  Awesome!

Used the 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter and 3 cups powdered sugar and it was creamy, smooth and perfect.  First time I made it as original recipes suggested and it was a bit crumbly.

This is delish!!!! My only suggestion is to use margerine instead of butter.  I've made it twice with margerine and once with butter and the texture is perfect with margerine and lumpy with butter.

My husband and kids are peanut butter fanatics.  I've never had a good peanut butter fudge (too dry) but thought I would try my hand at it.  I tried this recipe and it was fantastic.  Very creamy, very easy to make and dissappears quickly.

Mine turned out crumbly instead of "smooth" once I beat together the peanut butter mixture with the confectioners' sugar, but I went ahead and pressed it into a pan anyway, and it turned out quite nice. Next time, I'll add another splash of milk to make it smooth; hopefully it will turn out even creamier that way!

Besides what I feel is a needed sugar adjustment, this recipe is awesome. Very easy and with great results. I too would increase pb to 1 cup, reduce brown sugar to 2 and confectioner's sugar to 3, or perhaps even 2 and 1/2. Prior sifting of the confectioner's sugar would make the smooth texture even easier to attain. Great recipe, thanks!

Oh definitely will make this again! It's a great recipe but I would double all the ingredients because the serving was too little. However, it was way too sweet, even after I reduced the sugar to 2 cups of brown sugar and 2 cups of confectioners sugar. I think I would reduce it to 1 and a 1/2 cups of white sugar for future reference. And for all those people who didn't succeed the first time, make sure while you're dissolving the sugar into milk and butter that you heat slowly on low and increase the heat every 2 minutes until you get to medium heat. Don't start timing until it's a hard boil and make sure you don't over boil or under boil.

Great recipe - wonderful flavor.  I had to "knead the dough" at the end to incorporate all of the confectioners sugar, but the consistency was excellent and smooth at the end.

I had never made fudge before but had a craving for it. I had all of the ingredients on hand to make this and was pleasantly surprised w/ the ease of it. Follow the instructions and you shouldn't have any trouble. My mom, who is an expert fudge maker was even impressed!

I make this all the time, but use 1/4 c. butter or margarine, 1/3 c. light karo syrup and 4 c. confectioners sugar.  It is sweet enough without adding more brown sugar.  Just smash it all together and pat down in an 8" by 8" pan.  No cooking, and so easy, can even add some crushed peanuts or even use crunchy peanut butter.  Still need the 1 t. vanilla, and can even add a dash of salt if desired.  Easy and delish.

This fudge is amazing. I had never made fudge before but this was soo easy and turned out perfect. My boyfriend had bought some peanut butter fudge and it was so bland, I couldn't beliebv they could sell it. This stuff could sell for a lot. So much flavor. I am giving it to my friends and relatives with their christmas gifts. Thanks for helping me impress my boyfriend. I'm 22 and new to cooking and this made him praise me! :)

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. Usually I can't even make cookies right, so I thought I would mess this up for sure but I was wrong! The fudge came out perfect and even my mother-in-law who makes fudge the old fashioned way liked it!  I followed the other reviewers advice and added more PB and cut down the brown sugar to 2 cups...but I found out to late that I only had 2 cups of conf sugar and used what I had..they still turned out very sweet and tasty.

I have made this recipe many times, and it is my daughter's absolute favorite fudge!  My entire family loves this one!  The changes I made are:  1 c. of PB, 2 c. of brown sugar, and 3 c. of conf. sugar.  It is so easy to make!!

Delicious. I used 2 c brn sugar, 1 c peanut butter, 3 c conf. sugar. It is very good. A little too peanut buttery for me. I might scale it back to 3/4 cup next time. Great consistency and texture. Super easy to make. GREAT!!

There is no way that one can use the ingredients in the above proportions and enjoy eating this--the result is not far removed from eating pure chunks of sugar. I could not even taste the peanut butter because it was so sweet. Perhaps I should have read the comments first and tried one of the modified recipes, but as for now...I guess I'm out ~6 cups of sugar and a half-jar of peanut butter.

I've ruined plenty of batches of fudge over the years but this recipe is a winner! Very simple and very peanutty.  I rate my favorite recipes from "ok" to "suburb." This is "suburb!" It will become a family tradition.

I meant to change some of the ingredient amounts as others have suggested, but I forget about doing that.  I cut the boiling down to one and a half minutes, because it became frothy.  I thought, "Oh no! Here's a failure", but the next step went well, and when it came to the sugar, I used my mixer after folding them into each other.  It was like a bunch if peddles before hand as someone mentioned, but the mixer did it well.  When it was time to smooth it out in a pan, it had cooled quite a bit, so it was a struggle to do.  Next time I guess I'll just work faster.  It taste amazing! Thanks

Yes, this was an easy recipe. But I was very disappointed, especially with all the great reviews it got. My fudge didn't have too much of a peanut butter taste and it was very sweet and it didn't turn out creamy at all. Just very dry. Thanks anyway.

VERY delicious! Like everyone else I changed it to 1 C. peanut butter, 3 C. Confectioners sugar and 2 C. brown sugar. Also, to add texture I used 1/2 creamy PB and 1/2 crunchy PB. This was my first time every making PB fudge and it turned out wonderfully.

Awesome PB fudge!  After reading the reviews I made a few alterations. I reduced the brown sugar to 2 cups, increased the PB to 1 cup, and made sure I whisked the melted butter, brown sugar & milk until very, very smooth. When making fudge (I have asked Santa for a candy therometer this year) I tend to error on the side of caution and boil for half a minute or a minute less than stated, and never above medium-low (4 on my stove).

I followed the recipe exactly, even testing for the softball stage/using a candy therm. and it still came out crumbly. I did change the recipe to the 1,2,3 cup that everyone else mentioned too and while it tastes good, it's just a crumbly mess. Maybe I can use it for a cheesecake crust or topping or something.

Very yummy.........However a tad bit too sweet and not peanut buttery enough.  I even followed what a lot of other reviewers said and changed the measurements to 3-2-1.  Next time I will add even a little more peanut butter probably 1 1/4 cups, and a little less powdered sugar.  Otherwise great!

This Peanut Butter Fudge recipe was very easy to make.  I followed others with the 3-2-1. A very sweet tasting fudge.  Next time I make it, I'll mix with a mixer instead of a wooden spoon as it had lumps and wasn't completely mixed. Co-workers enjoyed it.

I'm rating based on the former comments.. 2C brown sugar, 1C peanut butter & 3C confectioners.. EXCELLENT & oh so simple!!  I'm afraid my peanut-butter-loving roommate will be asking for this one ALL the time now!   **update**  made this one again this morning & it was just as simple & perfect.  was a big hit at the office, in place of a birthday cake.

This recipe is much, much too sweet, to the point where it's not enjoyable. Sorry.
Brown sugar is an interesting touch but it's not needed considering the sweetness of the peanut butter and powdered sugar. If you must add brown sugar though I'd say no more than 1/2 a cup. 
This one's a miss.

AWESOME FUDGE! fudge was super easy to make. I followed all directions, except I did follow some users suggestions of: 3 cups of pwdr. sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, 2 cups brown sugar. I also used Evaporated Milk, gave it a richer taste! I used my mixer to incorporate the hot mixture w/ the powdered sugar. It became very smooth and cooled quickly. Line your pan w/ plastic wrap or foil for easy clean up and smooth appearance. I used a 9 x 13" pan and it made the perfect thickness for us. Fantastic Fudge Recipe!

It's still chilling, but so far it looks like it's turning out great. I followed the advice of several other reviewers and did the whole 2 cups of brown sugar, 3 cups of powdered sugar, and 1 cup of PB. Since I don't have a mixer I did it all by hand (I don't recommend it...). Took about 5 minutes of vigorous mixing to get all the clumps of powdered sugar mixed in and for it to become smooth. Tasted great off the spoon. ;)

**UPDATE**
Tasted great and was a hit! A bit sweet, but tasty! The PB flavor was not overpowering at all and it came out just like regular fudge.

Thanks for the great recipe! I know what I'll be making this holiday seasoning for the gift baskets.

This was surprisingly good, and easy too. I decreased the brown sugar to 2 cups as suggested by another review. I also cooked the brown sugar, butter and milk in the microwave instead of on the stove. It worked perfectly, I just checked on it after 2 minutes and made sure it was at soft ball stage. I also added a half bag of mini marshmallows to the hot mixture before adding the powdered sugar...makes it a bit creamier I think. Altogether, a good peanut butter dessert!

i tried this recipe once as originaly directed and once with reduced sugar and more pb. it was ok original but excellent when modified. it was delicious and i will make again. it made it to iraq with no problem my hunny said it tasted great then to! i was very happy with it but a little dissapointed in reading the reviews. i find it amazing people are so rude and actually insult others. being a first grade teacher i find it interesting to see grown women on a recipe website actually making insults. be nice!

I made this recently for my peanut-allergic son using Sunbutter in place of the peanut butter. I'm not sure if it was the sunflower seed butter, or if it's normal, but it didn't want to come together and got pretty oily on top. I was ready to throw the whole pan out when my (calm, cool, collected) husband stepped in and pressed it into the pan, blotted off the oil and put it away and said, "well, let's just wait and see". It turned out just fine. Not only did my son get to enjoy "peanut butter" fudge for the first time, but we were also able to share it with another man who used to be a huge peanut butter fan but recently became allergic. Yay!

I made this last night and followed the 1, 2 , 3 cup changes that were recommended. Mines did not come out lumpy, however the texture is more like a coarse cookie dough rather than a fudge. When I cut it, it crumbled into pieces.

Well, I too ended up with a bowl of pebbles but was able to recover. I'm certain I boiled too long which caused the candy base to dry out -- instead of timing it I was using a candy thermometer and I think my thermometer has broken! Bummer. The candy base was not grainy though, so I figured I could still save the fudge. I just added a splash of heavy cream to moisten, then a spoonful of peanut butter to make it creamy again. Beat it then stirred and mashed it together. When I saw it was able to be smoothed I knew it was not ruined. It came out just great!

I only gave 4 stars though because even though it's delicious, I have another peanut butter fudge recipe that I think tastes slightly better (though it doesn't set up as well). I did the 2cup-1cup-3cup changes as mentioned in other reviews.

I also made the recommended changes, but substituted cream for the milk the second time I made it. It was even better with the cream. Obscenely rich, I know, but with all the fat that's in it already, a little extra couldn't hurt.

So easy to make and even though my family thought it was a little too sweet, they couldn't keep out of it.  It dissappeared fast!!  I believe it taste a lot like peanut butter cookie dough but melts quickly in your mouth.  Will certain make again.

I followed the directions, exactly as stated. I even read 9 pages of reviews, just to be sure. Yet my fudge didnt turn out as I had hoped. The mixture in the pan was ok, then I added the peanut butter and vanilla, once removed, and mixed together. When I poured it over the c. sugar it was almost as if the sugar wasnt "melting" as it should. There were lumps all in it. I dont have a sifter, maybe that would have helped? Overall it mixed ok, I used a wooden spoon. I wasnt sure how long to beat it, because of the lumps. its cooling in the fridge, and aside from the c.sugar lump here and there it appears to be hardening like it should. I had a lick from the wooden spoon and the taste is out of this world. I love pretty much anything peanut butter, so I'm excited to try one!

Great, easy recipe.  Followed other reviews and increased the peanut butter and reduced the sugars.  Also halved the recipe and it made 1/2 inch thick bars in an 8 x 8 dish.  Also used Saran Wrap, which was a lifesaver...you don't want to waste any of this fudge by having it stick to the dish!

I followed other suggestions on the adjustments. I didn't have vanilla, so I used 1 tsp. of hazelnut creamer, and when I shared some with my neighbor, he said it was better than his grandmothers. You can't get a bigger compliment than that!

This fudge is insanely good with the modifications others have also made (2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup peanut butter). It really is just incredibly easy and tastes fabulous. If the recipe doesn't work for you, it really isn't the recipes fault - try it again with the above modifications - and try not to eat the whole pan!!! I'll make this over and over again!

We have meade this 2 times.  ONce the way the recipe is written and the second time with the modifications and some chocolate chips on top.  We like the second way better. 

4 stars for flavor, I like it creamier, but 5 stars for *easy to make*.

This was the EASIEST recipe!  I am just amazed at how easy it was, and my children just love the fudge.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and used 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup PB and 3 cups confectioner's, and it came out perfect.  Also, by mistake I had crunchy peanut butter in the pantry, but I used it, and it still came out great!  Great, easy, quick recipe with no candy thermometer needed!

VERY EASY!!!  Very fast and very delicious!  I did incorporate the change of less sugar and more pb and that seemed to help.  I used real butter and whole milk which makes it creamier.  The reviewer whose fudge did not do well probably used margarine and low fat milk which made it chunky/flaky.  This recipe is great

This was super easy and the flavor is excellent.  Yes, it's very sweet but I'd say that's because it's fudge.  It sets up pretty quickly but I had a taste tester in it before it was even fully set.  It passed the test.  I'm thinking of drizzling chocolate on it next time, or maybe a layer of chocolate on top.

This was my first attempt in making peanut butter fudge.  It turned out very yummy and pretty easy.  I also followed the adjusted measurements in the other reviews.  Next time I am going to try adding a layer of melted chocolate on top of the fudge before chilling.  This was much easier and less "messy" to make than the traditional Chocolate covered Peanut Butter Balls.

I also followed the advice of others and used 2 cups of brown sugar, 3 cups of powdered sugar, and 1 cup of peanut butter.  It came out PERFECT!  I used a hand mixer to blend the liquid with the powdered sugar and the fudge came out SO smooth and creamy!  My only mistake was using a store brand of peanut butter. My fudge was good but the taste of the peanut butter definitely comes through, so be sure and use a good brand like Skippy or Reeses. Also be sure your peanut butter is fresh. Mine was a newer jar but just had kind of an "old" taste, which of course I didn't realize until AFTER I made the fudge!  I know my fudge would have been even more awesome had I used better pb, so I give this recipe 5 stars!

Just made this fudge for my husband.  It is easy and delicious.  I too made the following substitutions:  1/2 cup margarine (instead of butter), 2 cups brown sugar (soft and light), 1/2 cup 1% milk, 1 cup creamy peanut butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 3 cups (unsifted) confectioners' sugar.  I put the confectioners' sugar in my Kitchen Aide bowl and poured the hot brown sugar mixture on top and mixed on low/medidum speed for a couple of minutes until everything was smooth and creamy.  I will make this again (& again).

The recipe was very simple to make and it tastes great, however i made the few changes adding 3 cups of the confectioners sugar, 2 cups of brown sugar, and 1 cup of peanut butter.

This recipe is so easy and yummy! I made it using what users said with the 2 c brown sugar, 3 c. confec.sugar and 1 c peanut butter.  I'm so not the cooking type, I'm the type that messes up even the refridgerated already made cookie dough :) But I made this and it turned out great.  I love this recipe!

I should have read the other reviews about changing the amounts of the ingredients. Overall, it tastes good, but it wasn't as creamy as I'd hoped, it was kind of dry.  Maybe I'll try it again using the others reviewers suggestions!

I have my own taste tester, my sister.  She has a gourmet palate.  When I took this fudge to her she said yes this is a keeper.  Also I got rave reviews from my fellow employee's at the office.

This recipe was fun and easy!  I had never made fudge before and I had no problem.  I did follow other's adjustments and used the 3 cups of powdered sugar version.  I can see how others would have problems with the sugar getting "pebbly" but after a minute or so with my hand mixer, most of them disappeared.  I didn't try this, but possibly if the powdered sugar was sifted it could help with that issue?  
All in all, very good recipe.  I made it for a co-worker for his birthday and everyone at the office enjoyed it.

A great, dense fudge that doesn't fall apart - many thanks!!  I followed others' advice and did the 1 c. p.b., 2 c. brown sugar, and 3 c. powdered sugar.  Once all together, I'd beat it about 5 minutes, and it was perfect!

This was great!! I give it 4 stars because I used the recommendations of previous reviewers.. My boyfriend and I still thought it could've used a bit more PB.. maybe 1 1/4c? But we really love peanut butter.. hahah. I used natural chunky PB because that's what we had and I had a pregnancy craving for fudge. :) It still turned out perfect and we actually liked the addition of the pieces of peanuts. I used my hand mixer to beat the PB/brown sugar mixture into the confectioner's sugar.. I wouldn't do it any other way. I'm not that strong! I think it probably turns out with a better texture that way. No problems with the butter separating or anything. YUMMMM!!!

This fudge was awesome. I took the advice of some of the other postings and did 1c pb, 2c bs and 3c cs. It tastes exactly like peanut butter fudge it buy from a local candy store.

If your mixture comes out sandy it's because you didn't mix it good enough.  This candy is not like mixing pudding. You have to put some muscle in it. I had to use my kitchenaid mixer to get to smooth enough, but I expected to.  It's a fabulous candy if you follow the directions.

This is the Very Best Peanut Butter Fudge. It's creamy and smooth and very rich. I've found that other PBF recipes that rely  more heavily on confectioner's sugar and less on brown sugar are a bit dry and grainy. I prefer this fudge to even chocolate fudge. Perfect!

Way too sweet, I couldn't taste much peanut butter, tasted like I was eating a bowl of sugar. Wish I had read all the reviews, maybe the adjustments would have helped. I've had really great PB fudge in the past, still looking for that recipe!

I used the less brown sugar/more peanut butter recomendations, as my peanut butter has sugar in it. The first time I made this I thought "it's got to boil longer, to reach the right temp!" when I finally took it off the heat and poured it in the confectioners sugar, it immediately turned crumbly. I pressed it into the pan to cool. Tasty, but still crumbly. The second time, I boiled it for the two minutes, then took the sugar (in a sifter) and put the sugar into the fudge, about a 1/2 cup at a time, and mixed it by hand untill I felt like it was stiff enough. All together I used less than 2C of confectioners sugar. It turned out perfect! My husbands office and our gaming group loved it. I can't wait to try this with hazelnut butter!

I used all the brown and confectioners sugar I had (1 c. and 3 c. respectively) and these were still really sweet.  They are good, but I can't imagine how sweet they would be with all the sugar and I used 1 c. natural peanut butter too.  With only 1 c. of brown sugar they seem to be the consistency of fudge (no crumbling).

Wonderful!  I greatly reduced the sugar (both brown and confec.) after reading reviews and may increase it a tad next time as I think it could be a little sweeter - probably because I used "Smart Balance Omega" natural peanut butter which doesn't have any sweetness to it at all.  Also, I did use a full cup of p.b.  Yum!

I was surprised by this recipe.  Maybe I used the wrong kind of brown sugar, but my fudge came out a really dark brown color instead of the light color the picture shows.  I also thought it tasted like a no bake cookie without the oatmeal.  Don't get me wrong I thought it was good, but not what I was expecting.

I have made this recipe over and over and it is FABULOUS! We love it! I don't use all of the confectioners sugar; it makes it softer(I leave out about a 1/2 cup). Very easy and everyone will moan and groan over how good it is!

Sorry, I did not care for this fudge.  It is easy to make, but when  it called for boiling for two minutes (not using a candy thermometer) it made me nervous.  I've made many batches of fudge as well as hard candies.  The sugar mixture doesn't boil long enough to dissolve the sugar, it ends up with a grainy texture.  I like fudge to be very smooth.  I know it's fudge but this was exceptionally sweet.  My four girls however loved this fudge.  If it wasn't for them, it would still be sitting here from Christmas.  Easy to make, but not the taste/texture of fudge I prefer.

This is the second time we made this fudge. We followed the recipe exactly. My 15 year old son made it the second time. Both times it turned out GREAT, the right taste and texture. This is a hit with everyone we have shared it with. This recipe will be one we use all the time. Great Fudge!

My great grandma used to make peanut butter fudge for Christmas.  It was my only fond memory of visiting she and my grandfather.  Noone in the family ever got the recipe from her before she passed.  When I wanted some, I was very disappointed in the recipes I tried, until this one. 
Last year I hosted Christmas for my family for the first time and wanted desperately to have a fudge like Grandma made...and thankfully that's when I tried this one!  Right on for creaminess and taste.  I'll be making it every year now.  Thanks for helping me get back a happy memory, and a lost family recipe!

I have made this recipe for the past four years at Christmas and is now a familly favourite.  I double the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan.  It always turns out and I always get rave reviews.

The flavor of the fudge was really good, but, for some reason, it didn't set in the fridge. It was still too soft to cut after a night...i had to put it in the freezer to get it out of the pan. I love the taste, so i'd like to know what went wrong. (i followed the instructions exactly)

Very good, very simple.  Found was best to stir in powdered sugar with a wooden spoon; it took about 5 good minutes of stirring before all the little morsels were smoothed together.  Doesn't take long to set.  My family loved! Thanks!

I should have taken the advice of others and put less sugar/more peanut butter. This was WAY too sweet. I ate one piece and had a headache. Sorry.

this was very easy. it took only about 30 min. the fudge was rich and firmed up nicely. my wife thought i was a little to rich.but she still ate half the fudge so it must have been pretty good. butter and brown sugar mix blends easyer with powdered sugar if you mix them right as you take it off the heat.

I must have done something wrong...this tasted almost like peanut butter cookie dough.  I also don't think it was creamy enough.  Hopefully you will have better luck than I did.

Sorry but we didn't care for this at all! It was sickeningly sweet and tasted more like peanut butter mixed with confectioner's sugar than fudge. The texture wasn't what I expected either. The fudge was all grainy and I couldn't get it to set properly, even after one night in the fridge. Thanks anyway.

I think my husband has gained 10 puonds!  The last batch of this, I made a (small) plate for the neighbors and HE ATE THE REST!  It is so unbelievably simple and fast to make.  I used some of the modifications recommended and each time it is WONDERFUL!!!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was so easy that I allowed my 12 yr old son to make this, this year for our cookie trays.  It was wonderful.  The only thing extra I did was to put it into my stand mixer and let it beat until it was very, very creamy.  Oh my Goodness I had to email this recipe to two of my friend on Christmas Eve.

I made this for Christmas and it flew off the plate.  My adult kids and grandkids couldn't get enough of it.  I changed the amounts to: 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter and 3 cups confectioner's sugar.  Spread half into a 4 x 4 pan then added chopped walnuts to the other half and spread it into a 4/x/4 pan.  Both kinds were devoured.  This is deffinately sweeter than chocolate fudge, but oh sooooooooo good.  Will be making this again.

Pro:  it really is an easy recipe.  Con: I wish the strongest impression was of peanut butter and not just sweetness.  Pro:  It really is easy to make!

WOW - I have only tried to make fudge once before and it didn't turn out, this was so easy.  I used others suggestions, 2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 3 cups sugar instead and it was so good.  It is sweet, but Hello . . . fudge is supposed to be sweet - my husband is a very picky eater and he LOVED it!

Very good peanut butter fudge.  I made it using the alterations with the sugar and the pb, but mine came out a little crumbly.  Next time I will make more accurate measurements.  The fudge still tastes delicious!!!

This is a GREAT & EASY recipe.  It's my first time making fudge, and I thought I could never find one close to my great grand mother's fudge, but this is it...I would add peanuts, but that's a preference.

This was a very easy recipe to follow, I wish I had read more of the reviews, because it was VERY OVERPOWERINGLY SWEET. I couldn't eat it. I can definitley see the potential in this recipe if the sugar is reduced. Execellent directions though.

HERE is the 'old-fashion country fair' PB fudge I remeber from growing up back east.  I have attempted many times to find the right recipe that would give the taste AND texture.  PB fudge is suppose to be 'lighter' in texture than the just a fabulous heavy and creamy chocolate fudge.

Thanks Angie!!!!

I thought this was an extremely easy fudge recipe to follow. These came out very tasty, however next time I will use a little bit more peanut butter as I didn't think they had a big peanut butter taste.  I also used dark brown sugar which gave them a nice color.

This tastes very good.  My one complaint is that it doesn't get very hard - even after refrigerating over night.  I don't know if this is because I didn't let the sugar mixture boil long enough or if it is the nature of the "quick" fudge recipe.  Oh and I did as others suggested and increased the pb to 1 cup, brown super down to 2, and powd. sugar to 3 1/4.

I don't usually like fudge, but this was excellent. I followed the directions... although make sure you have everything ready because you have to work fast. I also melted 1/2 a bag of ch. chps and drizzled on top of the fudge then swirled- placed the pan in the freezer and in an hour or so shared it with my friends. Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly and add more of peanut butter. it turned out too sweet so my family didn't like it at all. I freezed it overnight but it was still sticky and I wasn't able to cut it into squares.

The taste was wonderful, but at higher altitudes the recipe needs to be adjusted for texture.  If you are cooking in a higher altitude, you may want to reduce the amount of powdered sugar to 3 cups and add as you see fit.  I made this recipe and it was a little crumbly, but it would have been solved with less powdered sugar.

This tastes good, but I have never made fudge before and followed other reviewers advice to go 1 c peanut butter, 2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups powdered sugar and mine came out very crumbly.  I boiled (a rolling boil) for exactally 2 minutes.  Won't throw it out :) but will probably try recipe as it was written next time.

This fudge was awsome. I did add more p.butter and less sugar. This was also a very easy to make. I made it while I waited for cookies in the oven. This is right up my alley.

This recipe is good for a quick fudge. However, you can still feel the tiny grainy texture of confectionner's sugar. Maybe stirring in peanut butter while sugar mixture is still on fire, and immediately pouring it on confectionner's sugar would help it. I won't look for another PB fudge recipe though, for this one is quick and satisfying. I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I FOLLOWED ADVICE OF OTHER REVIEWERS BY DECREASING BROWN SUGAR TO 2 CUPS, INCREASING PEANUT BUTTER TO 1 CUP, AND DECREASING POWDERED SUGAR TO 3 CUPS.

Very good recipe. I used the suggestions by others to use the 1 cup PB, 2 cup brown sugar (not packed) and the 3 cups sifted powdered sugar. I also used the electric mixer. Turned out great. Not grainy like many home made fudges seem to be. Very smooth and perfect peanut butter flavor. Have made several times already. Thank you.

This fudge was very easy and simple to make.  I made a few changes like 2 cups of brown sugar and 1 cup of peanut butter and 3 cups of confectioners sugar.  My kids loved it and said it was very full of flavor! I will definitly give it out for christmas gifts.

so quick and easy...and doesn't require marshmallow creme or sweetened condensed milk.
I did the 1,2,3 cups of p.butter, b. sugar, and powdered sugar.  Also stirred in some many chips after I poured it over the powdered sugar.  
Very good.  a definite keeper.

Very easy and sweet.  Everyone at work loved it.  I just kinda thought it tasted more like the center of a buckeye candy than fudge and it didn't have the texture of fudge.  Good for a sweet peanut butter candy.

I took this for a church dessert night, and less than 1/4 was eaten.  This was good fudge, but not a spectacular dessert in general, I guess.  It did crumble when cut, so the pieces didn't look perfect.  In response to other reviews: 1) If your fudge doesn't harden properly, you haven't boiled it long enough.  When it says "boil for 2 minutes" that is referring to a rapid boil, not a few occasionaly bubbles.  2) For those who found they got "pebbles" when stirring the mixture into the confectioner's sugar, use less confectioner's sugar.  The suggestion to use the 3 cups of confectioner's sugar, 2 cups of brown sugar, and 1 cup of peanut butter is what I did.  3) The suggestion to add cocoa powder to 1/3 of the mix and then swirl it in sounds great, but specifics weren't given. I'm guessing you'd add about 1 1/2 Tbsp. cocoa powder to the 1/3 mixture BEFORE pouring it into the confectioner's sugar.  I don't really know how you'd swirl it in either.  It's pretty dry.  I'd love to hear how to do it, though.  Chocolate makes everything better!

Yum! I've made 2 pans of this in 2 days! I took the first pan to a picnic, and one guy told me he'd thought of telling others it wasn't any good so there would be more for him! I Took others' advice and used 2 c. brown sug., 3 c. confec. sug., and 1 c. peanut butter. Taste and texture were perfect.

I have never been able to make fudge, untill I tried this recipe. My family and coworkers beg me to make it!! sometimes I add more peanut butter about 1 C. It gets soft If left at room temp, so I usually store it in the fridge.

This was great! This was the first time I made a fudge of any kind, and it was delicious! I made these for my mother to take to work, because every day until Christmas everyone is supposed to bring something to work to share. It's great because it has the things even the most vague of bakers has lying around the house. I didn't think it was going to be that good because it tasted kind of funny while it was still hot, plus that seemed like a LOT of powdered sugar... But after it was chilled, it was totally transformed-- I had to keep reminding myself that I was supposed to be on a diet and stuff it in the very back of the fridge so it was hard to get to!

I usually do not make fudge but this is the EASIEST fudge to make. If you are cooking challenged, this is a no fail recipe.  One thing is DO NOT add any more confectioners' sugar.  Measure exactly and level the measuring cup with a butter knife, etc.  I am making this for teachers gifts this year.  Thanks for sharing!!!!!

I just loved this recipe! Made it to send to an Army son at Ft. Knox and a college son and it shipped well. I gave up trying to make any type of candy that uses a thermometer since the recipes never come out right. It did not turn out dry at all and the flavor was wonderful. I used natural peanut butter. Lovely recipe Angie, thank you for posting it.

I have never made fudge before, but this recipe was incredibly easy and got so many good reviews I thought I'd try it. The fusge is great!  Tasty and really smooth and creamy, although a tad sweet. I ran out of brown sugar and had to use half brown sugar and half turbinado sugar, which I thought would end up making the fudge "grainy" but it didn't at all.  This is a great, easy recipe and I can't wait to play with it to see what other variations work out well. Thank you!

Good stuff.  I didn't know that making fudge was so easy.  I cut mine in squares and wrapped in plastic wrap (since I'm the only fudge lover in this house).  Its even good when cold.

This is the first time I've tried making fudge, and it turned out great.  I'd definitaly lower the amount of confectioner's sugar.  Maybe that amount didn't work for me because I scaled it down to five servings, but I think it should have.  After I made the batch, I had to scale it down again to 2 servings, make another batch to add to it (obviously without the confectioner's sugar of the second batch.)  Still, it tastes great now.

This recipe is so simple.  I found that if you don't add all the brown sugar at once, you can get the lumps out easier.  I waited until the fudge cooled and then added melted chocolate on top.  YUMMY..  this is a classic!!

I was craving peanut butter fudge something fierce.  I threw this recipe together in 15 minutes with cheap honey flavored peanut butter and it is awesome!  More importantly, it's impossible to get wrong.  My husband hates peanut butter and hates fudge.  He devoured this recipe.  Angie's fudge is the best!!

Yummy!  I pressed roasted peanuts onto the top of this fudge.  Everyone loved it at our Super Bowl party.  Thanks so much!  :)

This was good.  Had to get my husband's help getting rid of the lumps but it is yummy.  I had to cut it into small squares because it is rich.  I will make this again when I get a craving for peanut butter fudge.

This recipes has a great flavor but an awful texture.  It is so soft I couldn't even cut it into squares.  Then trying to take it out of the oan for display impossible.  The fudge just kept losing shape because it was to soft!!!!!!

This fudge is delicious!  I recommend using a little more milk than the recipe calls for.  The rich peanut butter taste really makes these great!

The flavor of this fudge is excellent.  My complaint with the fudge is that it's very very dry.  It kept trying to crumble all over the place when I cut it.  It tastes so much like the peanut butter that I don't think it is really worth the hassle of cutting.

By far the best tasting fudge I've ever tasted or made. It has a wonderfully smooth, solid texture that's not at all gooey. A melt in your mouth treat.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I could never make peanut butter fudge before I found this recipe.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!

Very good flavor.  Turned out a little soft and a tad too sweet.  I think I will cut back on confectioner's sugar next time.  Took to work and everyone really seemed to enjoy.

What a Treat! I have never made fudge before and this turned out wonderful. The people at work could not believe I made it myself, and that I didn't need a candy thermometer. I followed the original directions, but I think I will add some melted chocolate to the mix next time. I think I found my holiday party gift! Wonderful!

This recipe is very tasty.  The only problem I had with it is that it didn't thicken up as much as I would have liked even after it was refrigerated.

This is the BEST peanut butter fudge I have ever eaten!  It is soooo creamy and rich, with just a mild peanut butter flavour.  My daughter LOVES it.  It is also quick and easy to make, and it freezes great.  Take this to your next bake sale; it will be the first item to sell out!

Very quick to make. A pretty good fudge but it's VERY, VERY sweet.  It didn't take mine very long to cool and solidify. 1/2 hr in the fridge, then 1/2 hr in the freezer, another 1/2 hr in the fridge and it was perfect :)

It tasted great and the kids loved it but was not firm enough to cut squares and put onto a plate.  Was quite gooey and we kept putting it back in the freezer to firm it up somemore.

This truly is the easiest fudge I've  ever made with a flavor that compares to my Grandma's fudge which took hours of stirring to achieve! I hope I can use this as a basic recipe for whatever fudge I desire!

Decided to make Peanut Butter fudge on request from my boyfriend. Never made it before so I settled on this recipe. It turned out AMAZING! We chose to use crunchy instead of creamy Peanut Butter and it didn't hurt it one bit!!!

I'm surprised at all the great reviews. Maybe I should've followed the reviewer's adjustments bc I, too, followed this to a T (since I lost my last deliciously unbeatable pb fudge recipe) and was quite disappointed with the results. I had no issues smoothing it out (I used the hand mixer for a while) but I did have issues with it hardening. Not that I like hard fudge but this batch continued to be too soft even after hours in the fridge. The kind of soft where you slice out cuts and hours later they're fusing back together again. Not great for serving at a party.

I followed other reviewers comments and it was sooooo good!  No leftovers, darn it!!!  Those having trouble with consistency, I suggest using real butter and real brown sugar (read the ingredients...not sugar and molasses). Also, for the newer cooks....confectioners sugar is powdered sugar, not regular sugar

Way more details needed for this recipe. Like other reviewers I got "pebbles" when I blended sugar and peanut butter mixture with confectioners sugar. I suspect the culprit is that I used natural peanut butter rather than typical store brands that have hydrogenated oils added for smoother texture. Also, it doesn't specify salted or unsalted butter or how many servings it makes. I was able to somewhat rescue this fudge by adding 2/3 cup hot cream while blending with sugar. That improved the flavor too but still wicked sweet. I will serve it at home but not as a gift.

I made this last year and it was so good!  Made it today and when I poured the hot ingredients over the powered sugar and tried blending it , the entire batch separated into a ton of small balls so I had to throw it out.

Tried it one more time and followed the steps exactly snd it failed again!

Noticed it happened to someone else!

TOO SWEET. As in recipe for diabetes. I already cut back 2cups sugar, 3cups powder sugar, 1cup p.butter & still too sweet, even my teenager did not like it. I ended up tossing the whole thing . I will try again with 1c brown sugar, 2c powder and 1c p.butter and see how that goes. Or find a diff recipe.

This is a very quick and simple recipe with ingredients that are usually on hand. It is very sweet.  I took others advice and did the 1 cup PB, 2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups confectioners sugar.  I think it would be good with a layer of milk chocolate on top too.

Texture is great- taste is blah. It tastes purely like hunks of sugar. I will agree with reviewers across the allrecipes board that if you have to make large changes on almost every ingredient it is not a good a recipe. Someone please write a new one on this site with the suggested changes and let me vote for that one! :-)

To Millikan, you may have used regular granulated sugar instead of confectioners (powdered sugar). I hope that helps.

Easy to make. Started mixing in the peanut butter at 1.5 minutes into the slow boil. It helped to liquify the peanut butter into the powdered sugar. Used my stand mixture to mix. Which helped.

Thankfully I read the reviews before I made it, so I used 2 c brown sugar, 1 c peanut butter & 3 c powdered sugar.  My first try came out pebbly & greasy so it became squirrel food. 2nd try was a lot better.  I packed the brown sugar a little bit & instead of pouring mixture over the powdered sugar I reversed it & used my Kitchen Ade. Nice & creamy.  Squirrels aren't getting this batch!

I made a few of the suggested changes, using 2 c peanut butter, 2 c br. sugar, and 3 c powdered sugar. It was amazingly smooth and flavorful. It made a great gift, and I have a line of friends waiting for theirs. I will definitely be making it again.

I read the reviews AFTER I made this and I should have read them BEFORE I made this. I, like other reviewers, ended up with a bowl of pebbles. I should have been a little leery about 3 1/2 cup of confectionery sugar. I think that is what killed it. I pressed it into a square dish and chilled it. It did come somewhat together, but it was very dry and tasted like confectionery sugar.

I read a lot of comments on this recipe and most of them said to use, 2.c brown sugar, 3.c powdered sugar, and 1.c peanut butter but I found that way to sweet, and I have a huge sweet tooth, so I would suggest that you use less sugar and raise the amount of everything else a little. Otherwise I loved this recipe.

Very easy!!!  Got lots of compliments- finished off with criss-cross fork impressions on top. I did put it in a 9x13 pan to cool- so got bite sized pieces.
Wouldn’t change anything in the recipe.

Double the recipe.   Following it exactly, but doubling it seems to make it turn out best. Beat it for a long time with a mixer. My students love it.

Since I tweaked this recipe, I will stick with 3 stars. I did like others suggested and made the powdered sugar 2 cups, the peanut butter 1 cup, and the brown sugar 2 cups. For me, it was still too sweet, but this is very subjective. Most like sweets really sweet, so for the average person, this is probably good. For me, next time, I will reduce the powdered sugar by at least 1/4 cup and maybe a full 1/2

I'm no baker so I follow recipes to a T.  This turned out gritty from the brown sugar, not creamy at all.  I think I needed to boil it longer than the two minutes it said.  I should've boiled the brown sugar until smooth then I think it would've been creamier.

Creamy Deliciousness !!  Tweaked the recipe slightly, based off of previous comments (which are always so helpful when making a new recipe). I used 2C of brown sugar, 2-1/2C of powered sugar and 1C of peanut butter. I used a 9x11 Pyrex dish. Wanted a thinner piece of fudge. And it worked perfectly for using the heart-shaped cutout. It came out so smooth and creamy!!  Made a batch for my sweet husband for Valentines Day.

So yummy! I was nervous about making this because I wasn’t sure I liked peanut butter fudge. After making this, it turns out I do! Really delicious! I think it’s the brown sugar that gives it such a great flavor. I took other reviewers’ recommendations and adjusted the proportions slightly: 2 c. brown sugar, 3 c. powdered sugar, 1 c. peanut butter. Definitely will be making this again.

Absolutely LOVED this! Fudge has never really been my thing - even the marshmellow fluff stuff seems to fail for me, but making this was a complete no-brainer. Everyone who tried it loved it as well. Definitely making this again! :)

I made it following this recipe and it was delicious. However, the second time I made it I tweaked the recipe a bit. I used a full cup of peanut butter and decreased the confection sugar to 3 cups. Came out great!

I followed other reviewers suggestions of 2 cups of brown sugar and 3 cups of powdered sugar and 1 cup of peanut butter. This fudge came out perfectly! It was so creamy and smooth and had plenty of peanut butter flavor. I don’t understand why someone would say this is too sweet. It’s fudge! This is my new go to peanut butter fudge recipe.

It is VERY sweet, which is of course to be expected, but it's also a bit crumbly. I would use a bit less confectioners' sugar. This is really the most fun I've had with a recipe in a while, and it was SUPER easy to make! Just move quickly, and you've made yourself a whole tray of delicious peanut butter fudge!

Followed the recipe. by time I mixed with powdered sugar it was way to dry and lumpy. I had to put back on the stove and add more milk. I finally got it creamy enough to put in a pan.
It tasted to sweet and granular. I will stick to the marshmallow cream recipes for better results.

Its possible you didn't have it to a full rolling boil before you started timing it. Also you must start mixing like right as soon or as your adding the sugar and hot mixture as a general rule. I wasn't present when you made its not possible for me to tell you for sure the error. I'm sorry to hear it turned out bad. Never give up! Fudge is a necessity of life. LOL.

This is the only peanut butter fudge recipe I'll ever use.  As per other suggestions, went up to a heaping cup of peanut butter and down to about 2.5 cups of powdered sugar and 2 cups of brown sugar.  Depending on what I'm doing with it, I sometimes add corn starch for a little more body.   I also use margarine and water instead of milk and butter, turning this into a truly non-dairy fudge.   It might taste better with milk and butter, I don't know, but I know that nobody I've given it to can tell the difference.

I have done all kinds of things with this fudge.  I've piped it into silicone candy molds, waited until it set, and then popped in the freezer until frozen solid.  Coated in chocolate or uncoated, these make amazing candies.  Right now, it's setting in a  chocolate cookie crumb pie mold.   It'll be way too rich to be rightly called pie, but I'm guessing it's going to go over well, regardless.

Point being:  This is a versatile recipe that can do a lot more than make squares of fudge.  It's pretty easy to make, low mess, and fairly forgiving, so it's ideal for when you want to get creative.

It turned out amazing. Only thing different I did was a full cup of peanut butter and almost 4 cups of powdered sugar.
I was wondering if this recipe would work if I used a half cup peanut butter and half cup chocolate chip??

Recipe turned out wonderfully! Make sure you stir the butter, sugar and milk mixture constantly while bringing to a boil to dissolve all of the sugar. Keep stirring once boiling for two whole minutes then remove from heat and mix in your pb and vanilla. If you follow the recipe exactly, it will turn out perfect! Will definitely make it again, and I love the fact that I could make an excellent fudge without marshmallows or evaporated milk!

I followed the recipe exactly just like a few other reviewers, and while beating the mixture at the end of the recipe it turned into crumbles. Fudge is supposed to be a thick liquid when you pour it in the pan to cool, so I knew something wasn't right. I'm not sure why this happened when there are so many great reviews, usually I have great results on recipes with high reviews, but not this time.

I've tried this twice now exactly as mentioned and the ratios have to be off or it's too much powdered sugar.  Ended up dry and powdery, not smooth at all.

Am I missing something??  Multiple people keep saying they reduced the brown sugar to 2cups but the recipe only calls for 2 cups.  It calls for one 16 oz bag of brown sugar, which is 2 cups.  I followed the recipe except for the peanut butter, which I used more...1 cup instead of 3/4 cup.  This was my first atttempt at fudge and I will definitely be keeping this recipe!

This was super easy and quick to make
Ingredients I already had make it fun to pull out of my cupboard and just do it
I added chocolate semi sweet morsels 
I have not eaten any finished fudge yet but I was dipping my finger in the hot pot to taste it and YUMMMY! Its cooling and I have daughters fighting to get the fudge in the fridge

We have made this fudge a couple of dozen times. It is great but old Harry likes nuts in fudge so we added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts after all the mixing is done because if any earlier it may be a little harder to get all the little lumps of confectioners sugar. It did not crumble, it only did what it was suppose to do, every time. One time I made a mistake and added twice the confectioners sugar. I just made twice the fudge. When I printed the recipe it called for 2 ¼ cups of brown sugar. That is what I go by. The confectioners sugar is about ¼ cup less than a one pound bag so I just add the entire bag. It does not make any mess :) I would add a picture but all you would see is an empty dish. Thanks for the recipe.

Like other reviews, it comes out too crumbly when mixing in with the confectioners sugar, I added a little more butter and brown sugar with a small dollop of peanut butter and added it to the mixture to make it smooth.

Was very smooth and creamy but I think instead of the peanut butter I will try a bag of peanut butter mixed with chocolate chips .. Overall, the texture was good and I did have to cook mine a little more then 4 minutes before adding powdered sugar and   Peanut butter. I always put a little bit of water in a bowl and add  just a tsp of the boiled mixture  in the bowl and if you can form it into a soft ball then the fudge is ready to take off stove so you can add the  peanut butter and confectioner sugar. I Learned that little trick from my grandma that had no candy thermometer... lol... Good Luck if you give this method  a try!

I love peanut butter fudge. For some reason I can not make candy (I consider fudge in the candy category),  I made this fudge and it turned out great and it is delicious! I think next time I would like to try it with chunky peanut butter.

This was yummy and got lots of compliments at the Christmas party I brought it to. It is easy to make but it is just sooo sweet. I felt like I was eating refrigerated icing. Like I said, tastes good and easy to make but I just don’t think I would use this recipe again because it is so cloyingly sweet.

I made two different kinds of fudge today. One chocolate and one peanut butter. I used this recipe except I followed the suggestions of 2cups brown sugar, 3 cups powdered sugar and 1 cup peanut butter. This turned out awesome! My chocolate one was dry and crumbly. I cooked this one at a lower heat so maybe thats why it didn't crumble. I didn't use a candy thermometer. Really great though. I used honey peanut butter and the extra sugars didn’t affect it negatively.

I made the recipe exactly as written. I started timing my 2 minutes when it came to a rolling boil and stirred it almost the whole 2 minutes also and it came out very smooth. But I do agree with the other reviews this is SUPER sweet, now I like sweet but just one square makes me feel like I'm having a sugar attack. And it also doesnt have a big peanut taste. So I will try it again and follow the other reviews and cut back on the sugar.

I made peanut butter fudge and used this as a guide. I followed this recipe but did not add vanilla. Also, I love peanut butter fudge that actually tastes like peanut butter so I added 3/4 of a 16oz jar instead 3/4 of a cup... That os NOT ENOUGH. I used Jif Natural Peanut Butter and OMGOODNESS it was heaven ??. I am about to make more using Kroger brand Natural Honey Creamy Peanut Butter. I will give an update.

I absolutely despise fudge! Too sweet for me......notta..no! However my sister-in-law asked me to her peanut butter fudge and I have to admit that this recipe deserves 5 stars! Even my picky husband who also doesn't like fudge, licked the spoon!

Love this recipe, though followed my own method. It is incredibly sweet, so add a half teaspoon of salt to it which balances the flavour nicely. I always add a sprinkle of salt flakes on top before it sets too.

I used almond milk instead of cow milk (not that I wouldn't use regular milk, just didn't have any). It still turned out great! It's in the fridge to set up now, but I don't foresee any problems. It was beginning to set as soon as I poured it from the pan. I skipped the mixing bowl since I used the induction cooktop & moved the cast iron to my wood cutting board to mix. Thank you!

Followed the directions and ended up with the best peanut butter fudge ever! Easy to make, but you do need a mixer.

Was not impressed! Sickening sweet with a very crumbly texture and that was with less powdered sugar than the recipe called for.

I mistakenly added the peanut butter and milk to the melted butter and brown sugar before cooking the butter and sugar for 2 minutes. So I cooked the whole mix for 2 minutes. I then added the peanut butter mix to the 10X sugar in the bowl of my stand mixer and beat it for less than a minute. It was the perfect consistency, forming a soft clump that fell out of the bowl into my 8”x8” dish. I just pressed it evenly in the dish and let it cool. Like other reviewers, I used 2 cups of brown sugar, 1cup of peanut butter, and 3 cups of 10x sugar. It was good, but a little too sweet, so the next time I will cut one of the sugars back a bit. Consistency was fine.

taste was good, texture was terrifying! it was crumbly...not pourable at all! i manage to squish it and get it into ball shapes and will dip in chocolate to hope it holds it together.

I am 50 years old and have NEVER been able to make fudge.  No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't get it right.  So after having some pretty pricey fudge from a gourmet gift shop last night, I decided to try again.  I am very glad to report that this fudge turned out wonderfully!!!  It is just a teeny bit soft, but not bad.  I will chalk it up to humidity since it's been raining all day.   I did read many reviews and decided to make the suggested modifications to the sugars & peanut butter.  It's really delicious and I am thrilled!  Thank you again for posting the recipe and to everyone who offered advice in their reviews.

Instructions were very wrong as I followed them exactly how they were written. It was great at first really easy, but then I added the powdered sugar and that's where it went wrong. The sugar balled up into the peanut butter mixture and was not smooth at all. I had to take a spoon and break up every single little ball and there were tons of them. Even after doing that there was still small balls that couldn't be broken. After the peanut butter cooled and I attempted to cut it into squares, it crumbled into a huge mess. Too much sugar in this recipe.

I never realized making fudge was so simple! I cut back on the brown sugar using 2 cups and cut the confectioners sugar down to 3 cups. I increase the peanut butter to 1 cup and sifted the confectioners sugar to avoid lumps. Turned out like a dream. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it exactly the way directed, measured carefully...
turned out horrible.  NOT creamy, not fudge-like, but rather dry and crumbly.  Will not try this one again. Should have stuck with my old Reece s Fudge recipe. It takes longer, but it's worth it.

Made a double batch for a work party. Glad I did! I cleaned up the corners to made tidy pieces & enjoyed the scraps. I was skeptical about it all fitting in my (standard sized) Kitchen Aid mixer, but it was fine. Def a keeper!

I made it like it said turned out GREAT. The only thing I did different is wait to it got to a rolling boil then I started timiing 2 minutes and I took the pan off stove and put the pan  in a sink with cold water to cool it off before mixing with other ingredients... I was very happy with my Peanut Butter Fudge

I've made this recipe many times and it always turns out amazing! The only thing I started to change after a few times was the amount of peanut butter. Instead of three fourths of a cup, I upped it to a whole cup. Mostly because I was too lazy to measure it so tediously, when extra peanut butter is definitely not anything to complain about Also I noticed some reviewers saying that theirs pebbles up too much, make sure you measure your confectioners sugar correctly, too much makes it dry, and also don't cook the peanut butter mixture for too long!

Literally "easy peasy" - I am not a candy maker. I don't recall ever making fudge, ever! My significant other loves anything peanut butter so I gave it a try and to my surprise it was great! The only changeI would be to line my 8X8 dish with parchment or wax paper the next time just to make it easier to remove. Delish!

Absolutely delicious and super easy! Followed recommendations to reduce brown sugar by 1/4 cup and confectioners sugar by 1/2 cup. I would also recommend lining pan with aluminum foil - after it sets you can easily lift fudge out, pull foil off, and then use a pizza wheel to cut it into pieces! Love this fudge - definitely an excellent recipe!

Followed Connieluna  suggestions but just added 16 oz box slightly over 3 cups. 2 cups brown sugar and good size cup peanut butter. I used natural peanut butter. Just peanuts and salt.

I seem to have the same problem as everyone else weighting a bad review. When I mixed the Boiled mixture and the confectioners sugar its supposed to become "smooth" and pourable. I got a bowl of dry pebble like crumbs. Worried I did it wrong, I poured some milk in. It came out smooth and feeling relieved, and poured it into my dish and put into the fridge. It took about 2 hours to set and when I tried it, all I could taste was peanut butter and confectioners sugar. Disappointed.

I used 2 C. brown sugar, 3 C. confectioner's, and 1 C. peanut butter.   The trick in the end is to use a good mixer like a Kitchen Aid to blend in the confectioner's sugar.  Perfect every time, I live above 7000 feet and still no problem.

I make this along with a 1/2 batch substituting the "1 Cup peanut butter" with "2 cups chocolate morsels" and pour the chocolate on top of the peanut butter to get 2/3 peanut butter and 1/3 chocolate fudge on top.   A perfect combination.

This fudge is amazing and soo easy. I made some of the changes from other reviews and got the sugars down but I forgot to up the peanut butter. Either way it's amazing, quite sweet though.

I followed other reviewers advice and used 2 C brown sugar, 3 C confectioners sugar, and 1 C peanut butter. PERFECT consistency and no trouble at all making! Will definitely make again, with adjustments because my personal preference would for it to be less sweet and have more of a peanut butter taste.

I reduced to 2cups brown sugar, 3cups confectioner's sugar and  added 1cup peanut butter, like other recommendations - it was still way too sweet so I would reduce the confectioner's sugar by a cup again - UK users of this website will find the original recipe just too sweet. Having said that it's a great easy recipe and tastes better the next day when left overnight in the fridge. I loved it with the reduced sugar. Lovely with a cup of coffee!

Key word here is "EASIEST". Making homemade fudge is a pain in the behind, and this was NOT. It was super simple to make with minimal cleanup and delicious results. I'll make this one again for sure.

I've been making this recipe for many years now after experimenting with several other recipes for peanut butter fudge.  Most recipes I found came out very dry and crumbly.  But this one comes out perfect every time.  I see no reason to change the ingredients.  It has a rich peanut butter flavor and perfect texture.  Yes, of course it is sweet (it's candy)!  This recipe works well if you boil it for 2 minutes  beginning when you first start to see bubbles.  If you wait for a rolling boil before you start timing you will probably end up with a grainy texture.  The secret is to work quickly once you take it off the heat.  I don't recommend beating with an electric mixer.  Use a spoon.  Stir vigorously by hand and as soon as you feel it begin to stiffen, immediately stop and pour it into the pan to set.   You may still have a few tiny clumps of powdered sugar.  But resist the temptation to beat until every last clump of powdered sugar is dissolved.  You will likely end up with fudge that is unworkable and sets up in your mixing bowl.  Once set it is smooth and creamy every time.

It turned out a bit gritty as opposed to other recipes I've used. I think the marshmallow creme versions are a bit better.

I accidentally used white sugar instead of brown.  It came out just fine.   Really sweet , but really good.  Next time (today), I am going to use the brown sugar and increase peanut butter to 1 cup.

I used 2 C. brown sugar, 3 C. confectioner's, and 1 C. peanut butter per the suggestions in the reviews.   Started 2 minute timer once it was at a rolling boil and stirred the whole time.  It was perfect in every way! :)

This is the absolute best peanut butter fudge I've ever had in my whole life. My husband actually made it for me and he put it in a 13x9 glass dish instead of the 8x8. It is thinner squares but if you did the smaller dish it is too much in my opinion.  I'm hoping to find a chocolate one just as good.

I had the problem with crumbly fudge in my mixing bowl. What I did was dump it in my prepared pan and pressed the fudge in to the pan firmly and leveled the fudge out as best I could. Since the mix was still warm it came together and looked fine. Taste is great!

I followed the tips by OkinawanPrincess and used 2 cups of brown sugar, increased the PB to 1 cup and decreased the confx sugar to 3 cups. I used a heavy-duty stainless steel pan over number 3 gas flame. Stir all till it starts to bubble while stirring and STOP after if does or it will be grainy. Start timer for 2 mins and boil. Remove off of stove after and place on hot pad, add peanut butter and mix into boiled mixture with mixer then add confx sugar a little at a time while mixing till all combined for about 2 mins. Don't forget to add the vanilla also. I placed mine in a wax paper lined pan and it cut beautifully and was creamy and smooth in texture. It sat up correctly also. Very good recipe that I'll use again!

Best Fudge Ever. Used the 3 cups confectionary sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 2 cups brown sugar. Much better than other types with fluff or sweetened condensed milk.

Wretched recipe.  Scorched quickly despite following directions to the letter.  Then literally turns to DUST in the mixer.  It never reaches the recommended temperature if you read the article on tips for making fudge.  I plan to try again using LOW, not medium heat but I'm too mad right now!

This is the BEST peanut butter fudge I have tasted!!  Plus it is so easy to make!  I doubled the recipe without any problem.  But like some others did I added a whole cup of peanut butter to my doubled recipe.
Also, when I added the liquid ingredients to the powdered sugar and I used my mixer to mix the fudge, by the time it got smooth, it was pretty well to set up.  So instead of pouring it into the pans, I pressed it into the pans.
Also to address the problem of not setting up that some of the other reveiwers experienced, make sure you DO NOT USE DIET margarine or diet butter!  Diet margarine won't set up for ANY fudge.

This is probably just personal preference, but even though it turned out fine, as far as consistency, etc. I don't think the brown sugar was very good in this. It took away the peanut butter taste. I won't use this again.

After several batches, I found I like this recipe best when I use margarine instead of butter, 3 cups of powered sugar instead of 3 1/2, and I use off brand peanut butter. Sometimes I add walnuts and sometimes I add cocoa (like no bake cookies).

I gave 4 stars because I had to adjust the measurements. As others suggested I used 3 cups powdered sugar, 2 loose cups light brown sugar, and 1 cup PB. Next time will use 1 1/4 cups PB. 
Tastes really good. Melted some milk chocolate with some sweetened condensed milk and topped it after it cooled. Chocolate covered peanut butter fudge----YUM!

I was hoping for better.  Read the reviews used the changes in quantities mentioned.  Maybe it was the candy thermometer that messed me up, trying to get to 'soft ball'.  It never got that high of a temperature. It was at a rolling boil for over two min but only by 30 seconds.  It's definitely edible,  tastes good. It's crumbly is what I'm not happy with and it doesn't have a creamy texture either.  There is no pouring this  into the pan, it's more of pressing the large clumps into the pan. I'd try a different one.

I changed to 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, 3 cups confectioners sugar ((used other ingredients as written) and it turns out fabulous. My mother in law gets so mad because it tastes just like her recipe except hers is difficult and time consuming.

Awesome fudge!  I'm not sure of the rating etiquette on here but it lost a star because I did not follow the recipe as it's listed.  Following others' recommendations I lowered sugar to 2C Brown Sugar, 3C Confectioners Sugar and upped the Peanut Butter to a HEAPING cup (probably closer to 1 1/8 cups) but I don't think you could do wrong going up to 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 cups peanut butter.  I'm going to try 1 1/2 cups next time and compare.  I'd also note that I used JIF peanut butter (the regular creamy kind), not Smuckers Natural or raw peanut butter or anything like that as those products don't have oils in them to prevent separation, and I'd assume negative reviews on here that encountered separation *may* have not used a non-separating peanut butter...   I also added chopped candied pecans to the confectioners sugar and it added a wonderful crunchy addition to the fudge.  This fudge was incredibly creamy, tasty, and I'd pit it against any peanut butter fudge purchased on Mackinac Island.  I think I'm going to pair it with a chocolate fudge recipe and layer the 2.  S&%*'s about to get real!

This is my favorite fudge base. I read the other reviews too and did 2 C. brown sugar, 3 C. confectioner's, and 1 C. peanut butter. But, I omitted the vanilla (out of it) and added a cup of mini marshmallows to the butter/brown sugar mixture once the two were blended together well. Cooked on low stirring constant. Upped it a little higher in heat, where they began to melt. Once they did, on medium stirring constant. Once I timed the 2 mins, I removed it, added peanut butter, than on top of the conf. sugar, andused my beater on high. Wonderful. Would be awesome with walnuts.

My wife who is the PB Fudge expert really liked it but didn't think it was quite peanut buttery enough and a tad sweet.  Could have been my measurements.  But she did think it was very good.  Next time I'll try cutting back a little on the brown sugar and increasing the peanut butter a little

My attempt came out too dry. There was no "pouring" into the pan. As another reviewer noted, when I mixed the sugar/peanut butter mixture with the powdered sugar, I ended up with pebbles. I doubt I will waste my time on this recipe, again. Ingredients and time are too costly to waste.  If you try this recipe, I suggest following the advice of other reviewers, don't use as much sugar.

This turned out amazing, tastes even better after refrigerating for a few hours, even picky family loved it (the pickiest being my five year old son who exclaimed after trying "mommy you are a really good cook!" and my sister who doesn't let manners get in the way of a blunt opinion lol)

This was my first time making peanut butter fudge. I had looked at other recipes before settling on this one and I changed just a few things for mine. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of regular sugar as I had seen other recipes with regular sugar. I also reduced the powdered sugar down to 3 cups. Everything else I left the same. It turned out amazing. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I don't know what I did wrong!!!  I did it according to the instructions.  I thought, when the ingredients were all mixed together, that I'd get a creamy mixture that could be poured into a dish.  When my mix was done, it was still powder and not a creamy batter as I was expecting.

I love this recipe! It was super easy, delicious and needs very few ingredients. I use all organic ingredients and it came out rich and luscious. I used chunky peanut butter once, but the chunks get in the way of cutting into even pieces.

I love this fudge!!! i did not even need to go out and buy any extra ingredients and it tasted amazing! I'm not even that great at baking and it was an instant hit with my family! the only thing I will say is that when all ingredients are together the batter is not necessarily smooth, there are still little clumps of confectionery sugar no matter how much you stir it.  but overall I love this recipe and I will defiantly be making it again!!!

As written, the recipe was super sweet with a vague hint of peanut butter.  With the following changes, this was 5 stars: 2 cups of brown sugar, 2 cups of creamy peanut butter, 2.5 cups of confectioners sugar.

I made this last Christmas for my annual cookie boxes and it was a huge hit! I made it for the second time today, in the middle of August with it being 94 degrees outside because this baby I'm carrying wanted a peanut butter fix, and it was just as delicious this time!!! I definitely plan to keep this in my favorites list!

I have tried several peanut butter  fudge recipes and this is by far my favorite! I make and sell candies and baked goods at craft shows and farmer's markets and the peanut butter fudge made from this recipe is always a top seller!

I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and made the adjustment to 2 cups of brown sugar and 3 of confectioner's sugar, but it was still a bit too sweet for my taste. I might add less confectioner's sugar next time. The fudge did turn out creamy and had a good texture. My daughter enjoyed it!

Poured the mixture onto parchment paper sprayed with cooking spray in my dish for easier removal.  This is easy and delicious!

It was good, but I think there may have been a bit too much powdered sugar in it.

The only thing I did differently was I did everything by hand. I beat it by hand with a whisk and then a fork. Nothing electric was used. It turned out beautifully.  Not a single problem and I would make again. Tastes amazing.

I went with the 2c. brown sugar, 3c confectioner's (icing sugar), and 1c. peanut butter that others suggested, and it's a hit!! It's nice and peanut-buttery which the right amount of sweet. I chilled it for just over an hour in a skillet, since I didn't have a small 8x8 pan, which means the pieces weren't perfectly square, but who cares. I probably could have chilled a little bit longer before serving, but we still enjoyed it, and we have tons left :)

This was my first time making this recipe. I followed some of the other reviews and used 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 cup of Jif peanut butter, and 3 cups of powdered sugar. Followed the rest of the recipe as instructed. Taste good to my family.

This is exceptional for the amount of time and ease!! Taste and texture is better than most easy recipes, it's firm and rich and so creamy!  Taste like just like the highly technical candy thermometer fudge,  without all the headache! Trying it with chocolate chips next. This will be my first go to in fudge recipes from here on out!!

I have made this fudge probably a half-dozen times, and every time it's delicious. Even the time I boiled for too long (wasn't paying attention). The fudge was crumbly, but hubby said it was the best batch yet. Go figure. :)

Made this for Christmas and my Father-in-law who has celiac disease was ecstatic that he could eat it.  He called me later to say that he was really enjoying the fudge but it was almost gone.  I mentioned that we still had some at my house, as I had made too many sweets.  Two days later, he is at my doorstep with a made up excuse of needing to stop by for something and "Oh yeah, you mentioned that you had some leftover fudge that I could take???" LOL!

I followed the advice of other posters and used 2 c. brown sugar and 3 c. powdered sugar in mine. However, I have a peanut allergy so 1 c. sunflower butter was substituted for the peanut butter and it turned out amazing! This is my new favorite recipe!

I love the taste it's great much better then others I have tried. ! A little sweet so next time I will make a few changes.  However one thing happened and I'm wondering why. It came out smooth as silk but unless I put it in freezer or cold cold fridge it melts. Even in a fridgr with normal temp it melts some never stays real firm like some other recipes. What did I do wrong?

With the changes others mentioned, it is excellent (I used  3 -2-1 for the ratio). I make this every year.  Be careful to not let the boiling sugar mixture get too hot or boil for too long, or you will get the gritty / pebble texture & the butter  will separate to the top. Occasionally I get a thin greasy layer on top & I just dab it off with a paper towel.

After many failed attempts at fudge, I finally was able to make a very yummy fudge thanks to this recipe! My kids love it and so do I! I made a few changes (after reading the comments) and did 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioners sugar, and 1 cup peanut butter. I also started the timer when it first started to bubble and not completely boiling. YUMMMMMM

I made this recipe last night for my family and it was a resounding sucess! My dad even liked it and compared it to a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup! I took the advice of several others who have made this recipe and cut down some on the sugar. i used 2 Cups Brown Sugar,  3 Cups Confectioners Sugar, and 1 Cup of Peanut Butter.

Best tasting fudge almost ever; very creamy. I followed the reviews and decreased the sugar and increased the PB.

Had to take a quick second this Christmas morning to post a review of this recipe.   I made it on the spur of the moment to take to the family get-together today, after reading the reviews and making the same adjustments many others made (2 C brown sugar, 1 C peanut butter, 3 C powdered sugar). I had no trouble with this recipe at all!  Set my timer for two minutes after the butter/sugar came to a rolling boil, and had the powdered sugar waiting in the bowl of my stand mixer with the paddle attachment ready to go.  Stirred in the peanut butter and vanilla until incorporated, poured the mixture into the stand mixer, and mixed on low until blended.  In seconds it was one big mass of warm fudge that pulled away from the sides of the bowl.  Pressed it into a pan and chilled in the fridge.  Based on what we licked from the bowl, I can't wait to serve it to family today!  I think it'll become a Christmas tradition...maybe add mini chocolate chips next year??  Hope you try it!

I tried this fudge because it's Christmas Eve and I didn't have marshmallow cream for my regular peanut butter fudge recipe.  To my delight it was easy and tastes wonderful.  I read the reviews first and decided to follow the suggestions to use 3 cups confectioners sugar, 2 cups brown sugar, and 1 cup crunchy peanut butter.  The only other thing I changed was I had some whipping cream in the refrigerator so I mixed it half and half with skim milk.  It was creamy, easy to put in the square pan and set up very quickly.  I hope I don't eat it all before I take it for Christmas tomorrow.

When I first made it I had the same problem a few others had, it wouldn't blend smooth. Just a lumpy thick mess with butter pooling out of it. I threw it in the microwave for 2 minutes and then it mixed smooth. I guess it cooled too much when I added the peanut butter.  Its all good now!

Ok, I've been making fudge for years, and I'm very particular about consistency. I started with the typical marshmallow fudge, moved on to more challenging fudge and then when I was out of PB chips, I decided to give this one a shot. I hated it at first when I was stirring in the p.sugar. It looked awful and spread worse. I thought there was no way I was giving it to anyone. I'm used to fudge that pours and you can make pretty designs in before it sets up. This came out more like a dough initially and I basically had to press it out with my hands(I refused to use a rolling pin for fudge). BUT, the way it set up, while not super pretty, had a great consistency! I love a good dry fudge and this really had that. I may end up using this any time I'm making PB fudge unless I'm just really hung up on the way it looks. :)

I made it just as it says. To me it had to much oil of the butter on the top. Maybe next time I'll use less butter and see if that will help.

Quick and easy!   I started timing AFTER the boiling roll,  2 minutes stirring constantly. Tweeked, 1 cup of PB and only 3 cups of Powdered sugar, and only 2 cups brown sugar (packed)  Blended with paddle blade on KitchenAid, and added 1/2 cups chocochips right before pouring into 8x8 pan..chilled and was great!

I made it but my fudge never became 'creamy' and definitely not able to be poured.   I had to mix it with my hands and then decided to press it over a layer of hardened chocolate (melted semi-sweet chocolate chips).  In the end it turned out delicious but I'm not sure what  I did wrong !

Followed the directions with the exception of upping the peanut butter to 1 cup. Very important to let butter mixture boil before adding to the confectioner's sugar. Came out perfectly.

This was GREAT! I used 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups brown sugar and 1 cup of peanut butter because of that the reviews said. It was awesome. Everyone in my family loved it. Next time I will probably pour melted chocolate on it or swirl melted chocolate in with it

I made this recipe twice, thinking that I screwed up on the first.  I used heavy cream instead of milk both times.  The cooking in the pan process was looking promising both times.  But once I added the cooked mixture with the peanut butter and vanilla stirred in, to the sugar in a bowl.  It all went south really fast!  I mixed and mixed and mixed.  It never did get even close to smooth.  It was like little sugar balls in the bowl.

I had trouble with this like another  review were. When ever I stirred the mixture into the powder sugar it for me tons of little balls and was not wet at all. I added a little more milk and beat it some more. I didn't put it in the pan to form. it was good but never got hard enough. I would not make this again.

As CONNIELUNA suggested, I used 2 C brown sugar, 3 C powdered sugar, and 1 C (natural) peanut butter.  Turned out great.  Next time I would add 6 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips at the end and let mixture sit for a minute and stir only to blend so as to get a "cleaner" chocolate-peanut butter swirl.   Used 1/4 jelly roll pan rather than 8x8.  Great recipe.

Super yummy recipe! I too reduced the brown sugar to 2 cups, the confectoner's sugar to 3 cups and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup. I also added an extra splash of the vanilla. I read other reviews and took the advice of one that said to use an electric mixer to mix confectioners sugar and the peanut butter mixture and it pulled together quickly and very easily! Will definitely make this again and again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I also followed the directions and ended up with greasy pebbles covered in buttery oil!!!! Luckily someone suggested adding 2 tablespoons of evaporated milk and that helped but I'm still not pleased with the texture.

Very yummy. I did add more peanut butter and less sugar but I'm sure it would be good either way. Simple and yummy!

I followed exactly minus 1/4 brown sugar and I added to make the peanut butter 1 cup. this is the outcome I wanted to have... I did let it come to a full rolling boil on med/high heat before starting my two min. like some of the reviews suggested.  This stuff is amazing and my 2 sons won't stay our of it to let it cool... it is setting up nicely. Thank you for the reviews and tips and for the recipe. We love it !!

Used more pb and a few other variations.  Was creamy and did set up. Sold at Fleatown USA of Forest City, NC. They asked for more! (Made it as double recipe quite a few times now. Always use 1 cup pb per recipe and 1/2 cup less pwd sugar.Love the brown sugar flavor. My favorite !)

Holy smokes is this SUPER sweet. Way way too sweet. I followed the recipe for the most part. I used dark brown sugar since that's what I had opened and I added 1c of PB. Not enough PB flavor at all. The texture is nice, but the PB flavor, even with adding that little bit extra is not enough. The PB is very very subtle and the pure sweetness of this fudge overpowers everything. 
Also, I was having a problem I saw on another review where the mixture was clumpy after pouring it over the powdered sugar. I had to use my electric hand mixer to get all the little sugar lumps out, but it worked like a charm and ended up smooth. Not sure I'll be making this one again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! The first time I made it it turned out too sticky and a little too sweet, and it also had little clumps of powdered sugar in it- even after beating it forever. So the second time I made it, I let the mixture on the stove boil for a little longer so that it would thicken up a little more, and I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 3 1/2, and then I sifted the powdered sugar, too so that there wouldn't be any clumps this time..then put it in a square pan to chill in the fridge and it was perfect!! The best I have ever had! Everyone else that tried it was super impressed and surprised at how good it was as well, no one could get enough of it! It has only been a week since I discovered this recipe and I have already just made the third batch! Yummmm!!!

I made this for the second time & it turned out very well.  I think perhaps some had problems with it turning out gravelly was the boiling time.  I wait until it begins to boil in the center of the saucepan, then hit my timer for 2 full minutes, remove from heat.  I didnt have choc chips, but had hershey kisses and stirred them in.  They didnt exactly melt in, but I just wanted some choc in it.

I always made peanut butter fudge the old fashioned way, with white sugar, and much more milk, boiling for a long time to get soft ball stage. This fudge was done in a few minutes and turned out great. The only change was that I did not measure the peanut butter and probably used more like the full cup suggested by other reviewers. 
This fudge is sweet, but then again it is CANDY! I will probably still make my old fashioned recipe as I have every holiday season since my wife and I were married (43 years) but I will also make this recipe in addition.

This recipe is the best homemade I've tried (besides my grandma's). I've tried finding many different convenient peanut butter fudge recipes but they didn't taste right. I tried the "easy" microwave fudge it was so gross I wouldn't eat it. This was smooth and rich in flavor. I followed the recipe but took out the brown sugar that's the only thing I didn't add. I also added a little more vanilla. I let it set in the fridge for 2 hours and it turned out great! Very quick, convenient and tasty! Also to help others when I took it off the stove and added a little confectioners sugar it turned pebbley so I put it back on the stove and heated it back up until it melted what little sugar I added, I took it back off the stove and slowly whipped (didn't use a mixer, mixed by hand) until it started getting smooth. I only added in a cup at a time and whipped it until fully mixed.

I also did what the others have said about the brown sugar and peanut butter but I was unable to time it. I wasn't watching it closely and didn't notice when it started to boil. Oops! Lol Everyone LOVES it! They said it's even better than the fudge we bought while on vacation in Tennessee that they get every year! First try at fudge was a major success thanks to this recipe and the comments! Thanks!!

LOVE this recipe. I make it all of the time. I did edit a bit by decreasing the brown sugar to 2 cups. Most of the time when I make it, I use 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup of Nutella. It's a HUGE hit with my coworkers!

My family loves this recipe, made it twice first time it didn't get as hard as what I wanted, so the second time I boiled for 3 minutes. Great recipe!

I gave this 4 stars because after reading other reviews I did end up tweaking it a bit.I used 1 cup peanut butter, 3 cups confectioners sugar and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar because that's all I had. I melted about 1 cup of chocolate chips and spread it on top. It's amazing! I didn't expect it to be this good!

I read lots of reviews and I decided to make it with 2 cups of brown sugar, 3 cups of confectioners sugar, and 1 cup of peanut butter. It came out really great!!! Maybe a little too sugary for my taste but I'll definitely put more peanut butter in next time it was not strong enough. I'll be making this again!

I used Peter Pan Honey Roast Peanut Butter (my favorite).  Everyone who tasted it so far wants me to give them the recipe!  I may have put a cup of peanut butter instead of 3/4 cup but other than that, I followed it exactly.

I even wonder if 1 cup of brown sugar would be good. To me this is a little rich and gives a brown sugar flavor. I'm going to try it that way next time. Nice and EASY and good recipe. :)

Excellent! Everyone is a huge peanut butter fan in the house so I make this more than standard chocolate fudge. I'm a huge chocolate person but I actually prefer this peanut butter fudge, it's so good! I had never made fudge before so I followed the recipe exactly. It came out wonderful! For a little personal touch, I drizzled some chocolate and peanut butter sauce on top which added a nice little sweetness to the top and made it have a prettier presentation! Perfect if you have a mega sweet tooth. I also added some semi-sweet chocolate chips and some Reece peanut butter chips.

Very sweet and even though I followed this recipe to the 't', it crumbled and did not smooth out when I added it to the confectioners sugar and beat it. I pressed it down into the pan and waiting to see how it goes.

I just made this tonight and oh boy!! Very easy - and then made the mistake of topping it with a thin layer of milk chocolate. Heavenly. A creamy Reeses type flavor. I used 1 cup of creamy peanut butter instead of 3/4 cup.

I have been making this exact recipe for years now!  The main thing when making peanut butter fudge is to boil the correct amount of time and then you really do need to beat it (I always beat by hand) until its smooth, with NO lumps!  I would be disowned if I didn't make this at least a couple times during the season by my grandkids!

I wish I'd read the reviews and suggestions before making this because it was too sweet.  Next time I will definitely try the cup of peanut butter, and less powdered sugar.  Maybe the texture won't be as dry either, BUT at least in this recipe (my third attempt) the fudge actually set up so it's still a keeper, just needs some tweaking.  The other two recipes I'd tried previously were too mushy or gooey but this at least worked somewhat.

My first time ever making fudge. I was scared I would boil it too long. Well, now I'm thinking it didn't boil long enough! My fudge will not harden! And I went with 1 cup of pb as suggested by other reviewers. Way too much of a peanut butter taste.

I made this recipe last year for the first time and everyone loved it! Now every time I say I'm going to make some goodies, people always ask for some peanut butter fudge! I love it. 
This time I doubled the recipe because I needed to make extras and just one batch isn't enough! People always do correcting or changing. I wouldn't change this recipe at all. I'm only 24 and haven't been baking that long, but I know that this recipe is a huge hit where I'm from just the way it is! Happy hunger!

This set up for me really good.  The favor was not quite what I was hoping for.  Fudge tasted more along the line of a caramel icing .  Sorry.

I used this recipe today and it was way to sweet and it never hardened at all... I followed the directions and i put it in the fridge uncovered for an hr and a half and it didnt harden so i tried putting in freezer and that didnt work either.

I made this following the recipe exactly, the only thing I did was double it and put it in a 9×13 pan and then stick it in the fridge. It is absolutely amazing. My roommate typically doesn't like fudge but she can't stop eating it.

Delicious fudge. One of the best peanut butter fudge recipes I've made, and it is much quicker and easier than the marshmallow creme recipes.

I followed the recipe to a "T", even didn't start timer until it was at a full rolling boil, but it will not set up unless kept in refrigerator.  I had a feeling the peanut butter (I used Jif creamy) should not have been added to boiling mixture because it melted right away. I'm definitely going to try everyone's recommendations to adjust sugar & peanut butter amounts but I am also going to add peanut butter to powdered sugar and let butter mixture cool next time.

I made the original (15 serving) recipe and it came out beautiful but when using the electric mixer I ended up have to beat in only about 1/6 more cup(s) of milk because the mixture was dry and crumbly although I did the recipe so I was dumping powered sugar on the mixture instead of the mixture on top of the powdered sugar........oops!! :)But I think it came out creamier when I did the recipe how I did it but I'm going to be making this again Sunday and I'll try it how it's written!! :P

My very first fudge cooking experience.  I think this was pretty good.  It really did live up to it's claim to be easy and was certainly very quickly put together.  Yes I have tasted better PB fudge, but this is an excellent recipe for my first attempt!  I did as other readers and used 2 c. brown sugar, 1 c. PB, and 3 c. powdered sugar.

Very rich.  As in the video, I made it with the added chocolate.  It was very good but I could only eat one piece.  And I'm a BIG sweets fan.  I will make it again but for more people than the five in my house.

This was my first time making fudge. I read the reviews beforehand and used their changes; 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 cup of peanut butter,  3 cups of powdered sugar. I followed the procedure exactly as posted in the original recipe and it was so easy and the fudge turned out great! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very, very good. Sweet, but fudge is suppose to be! I start timing the butter mix when I see the 1st few bubbles and it turns out great every time. The kids can't get enough and are ready to dig in before it's even fully chilled. Awesome fudge recipe!

Oh my gosh! This is the best and easiest peanut butter fudge that I have ever had!! Make sure that you firmly pack the brown sugar in the cup or it will not get hard in the frig. So nummy. Thanks ANGIEH so much for the recipe! It will be my yearly recipe from now on. And probably monthly since my husband loves peanut butter fudge.

Potential, but much too sweet, too fussy to make. Mix just makes a crumble-type mess. I'll keep looking for a PBF that works right.

I was a little short on peanut butter when I made this, so I just used what I had (probably about 2/3 c.).  I also added a couple good pinches of baking cocoa to the powdered sugar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out wonderfully.  My kids (and husband) would hardly leave it alone.

The only difference I'll make is using a 9x9 inch pan, so the wonderful fudge won't be quite so thick.  Yum!!!

Good recipe, but wayyyy too sweet. After reading reviews, I cut down sugar to 2 c. brown, 3 c. confectioners', and upped the PB to 1 cup. Still a bit too sweet, even for a rich dessert like fudge. However, the recipe seems to adapt itself very well to changes, so next time I will use natural peanut butter, decrease the confectioners' and decrease the butter to 6 tbsp. However, I think the base recipe could make a fantastic peanut butter fudge frosting 

Some of the tips I collected that were useful: 
- Sift your confectioners' sugar and use an electric beater to mix it in 
- Start timing the two minutes AFTER is starts boiling
- Line the pan with buttered parchment paper for easy removal and less cleanup

Btw, if you use the quantities I said above, the whole pans comes to 5,000 calories, 120 calories per serving if you cut it into 42 squares.

If you decide to use less sugars as others have suggested, make sure you also cut down on the butter! Otherwise you will get a oily top layer! I did both ways & the original recipe was much better in my opinion. I also added a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.

This was a very easy recipe, everything went well until I put in the refrigerator to chill. When I took it out it seem to stick to the glass container. It taste like fudge and it look like fudge, but I could not cut it into square to remove it from the glass dish. Is it because I didn't oil the dish? Please help. I love this recipe.

Waaaay too sweet! Disgusting! I even added rice checking to the top and pushed them into the soft batter before chilling. Nothing takes the sickly-sweet edge off of these bars! Nasty!

Like many others I used 2 C. brown sugar, 3 C. confectioner's, and 1 C. peanut butter. Based on these measurements it was delicious but I cannot comment on the original recipe. I also added about 3/4 c. chopped peanuts. Very good!

I cannot wait to sink my teeth into this!  I have always stayed away from pb fudge recipes because I fail at them.  This one is GREAT! I did read all the reviews and adjust my amounts as most others did.  I licked the beaters and scraped a bit from the mixing bowl and it is wonderful!  I can tell already it will come out great by how it went into the pan, perfect consistency.  I also discovered that the mixture before adding to the confectioner's sugar tastes awesome and would be a wonderful ice cream topping.  I'm going to experiment and make another batch and stop there and see what happens.  I was thinking it would keep nicely in a jar in the fridge and then warm the amount you need for topping.  Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing!

I tried this but doubled up on everything because I just wanted to make a bigger batch.  It turned out perfectly and I did everything by hand.  I mixed the peanut butter and powdered sugar by massaging it together with my hands and then I poured the rest into the mixing boil after it was boiling for two minutes.  Because it was so hot and I began stirring immediately, the peanut butter melted just fine and everything blended perfectly and in just a few minutes.  I used a whisk and a mixing bowl and it turned out 100% perfect.

The fudge is delicious. Like others before me, though, I reduced both sugars by 1/2 cup and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup to reduce the sweetness a tad and give the peanut butter flavor more definition.

The basic recipe is very easy and is way less time consuming than the old ways. Progress can be a good thing.

I followed the directions for 20 servings very closely and it was a disaster. It tasted like peanut butter flavored sugar. I would not suggest this recipe to anyone.

Great fudge! Never knew it was so easy. I added a 1/4 cup of chocalate bits as it shows in the video. My grandkids loved it.

I made this at Christmas to give away and it was a HUGE hit!  Creamy and melt in your mouth.  Super easy too!  I actually made more for myself and froze it.
A little sweet though, so I reduced the sugar to 2 cups the second time.  I also cut it into smaller pieces to serve and it seemed better that way.

I just made this fudge...wow. It's very sweet. I used one cup of brown sugar and two cups of confectioners' sugar and it was still very sweet. I like it, but only in small amounts. I also made it vegan, using unsweetened almond milk and earth balance vegan butter. I will play around with this recipe and make it not as sweet. Thanks for the idea!!

I made half of the recipe and used almond butter instead of the peanut butter. I used half of all ingredients except the almond butter which I still used 1 cup. I started the 2 minute warning after it was boiling rapidly. It was very easy and turned out beautifully and smooth. But the other person was right, do not stir during the boiling period. I think this would also be excellent with walnuts if you like them. Also, it's fudge - it's supposed to be sweet.

I just made this... it's delicious! This was my first time making fudge, and it was incredibly easy. I didn't have sweetened condensed milk in the house, and these are ingredients I always have on hand. Plus I barely use marshmallow crème, and I'm lucky to find a fudge recipe without these ingredients.

To each their own, but our family loved this recipe. Of course it's sweet, it's fudge! And peanut butter flavor (and even sweetness to some degree) is easily adjustable to taste. Careful though, as too much adjusting with sugar and/or peanut butter could affect the texture. I added an additional tablespoon of peanut butter and it was great. But then, I like sweet...I eat less if I get a good dose of sugar in one small piece. :) I will whisk my powdered sugar first next time, as it is quite hard to get it " lump free" by hand. Overall great and super easy  recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter... And same problem as another reviewer. Everything was fine until the powder sugar... Not smooth at all...just crumbs. I however did successfully press it into a pan and let it set up. It looked fine to me but I cut myself a small piece.. Far too sweet and not very peanut buttery.

I really liked this recipe. I took the suggestion of the video to add some chocolate chips, but I would cut back on the confectioner's sugar a little bit more next time. Overall, a great, rich fudge that is very soft and creamy.

Followed directions exactly.  Like others I couldn't get it to mix smoothly.  I pressed it in a pan and refrigerated.  The next day I cut it in to pieces and stored in a Tupperware container.  It was edible but not creamy at all.  Very dry and crumbly. Will not try this again.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. The first 2 times it came out perfect, but this last time, I got the pebbles like so many others, and the butter separated. To try to salvage it, I put it all back in a pan on the stove over medium heat, added the rest of the jar of peanut butter and another 1/2 cup of milk, and beat it with the mixer while it cooked a little longer, until it was smooth and pourable. It's in the fridge now, so we will see how this turns out. Like the others, I'm wondering what went wrong?? Like I said, I've made it before flawlessly, so it must be something with a chemical reaction somewhere.

Holy cow!  This may be the best fudge I have ever had, a sentiment echoed by my dinner guests at our Christmas meal.  I used 2 C brown sugar and 3 C confectioner's sugar as suggested by other reviewers and added Giradelli's chocolate chips as well.  So smooth, creamy and delicious!

I took people's advice and decreased the sugar/increased the peanut butter, but even with modifications, it was really sweet. Other than that though, it was good; texture, flavor, and it was really simple. I'll probably experiment and see if I can find a way to make it less overpoweringly sweet.

Very good, only thing I might have changed would be to add more peanut butter. By the time you get to the end product, that peanut butter flavor isn't very strong.

this is the hardest fudge that I have made in a very long time.  The author should review her ingredients because something is very very wrong.  And it is not very flavorful.

made this twice today - trying for the third time.  Taste is wonderful but it's all crumbles.  Hoping three times is the charm :-)  And it wasn't.  packed brown sugar?  sifted confectioner's sugar?  will try again but very frustrating

So, when I made this I didn't carefully read the instructions and added the peanut butter during the cooking process.  I followed the advice from other reviews and used 2 C brown sugar and 3 C confectioners sugar.  I used a cup of PB, which I stirred in with the brown sugar and milk. I almost threw it out when I realized my mistake after consulting the recipe, but I went ahead and brought it to a boil, cooked for 2 min as instructed.  I tossed in about another 1/4 PB with the vanilla and then sifted in the confectioners sugar as I blended.  Came out creamy, smooth and delicious!!

I got rave reviews for this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to add 1C LESS BSUGAR, 1/2 the PSUGAR, so I also cut down on the milk

Followed the previous reveiwers suggestions but also switched out a cup of powdered sugar for 1 cup of splenda.  Added a few mini chocolate chips I had left over as well.  At first it looked like rocks in the mixer but quickly smoothed out.  Wasn't exactly pourable but it went into the pan and smoothed out nicely. Everyone thought it tasted great and looked store made it was so pretty after I cut it.  Definately wasn't dry or crumbly. Not my all time favorite fudge I have eaten but it was very close to it and very good. Will make again.

like regular peanut butter fudge waaaay better.  Not crazy about the butter in this.  Made it a little greasy tasting and soft.  It was edible but decided to save my calories for something else ;)

Could NOT eat it as fudge---first off it does not get SMOOTH as stated in the reciepe, second when you try to put it in the pan it does'nt pour, and the oils seperate.  I will probably do something with it, but not a good fudge reciepe, especially for a novice. Luckilly I do have over 40 year's cooking experience.

Thanks for a great and easy recipe!  Turned out yummy!! (I did follow the suggestions of others and used a full cup of p-nut butter, and used only 2 c of b sugar and 3 cups of the c sugar.) The results were fab and plenty sweet.

I followed the recommendations that many were making in their comments about the measurement of the two sugars and peanut butter and it turned out great!!!!! It was SO easy to make and tastes delicious. Thank you so much for the great recipe. I will definitely be making this again for my family!

I had dark brown sugar so it came out dark.  That was not the problem I added 1/4 cup more peanutbutter to heighten the taste and it still was ok but not enough peanut butter taste very sugary which I know fudge is suppose to be but I have had better so I am still in search for a real peanut butter fudge recipe.

Okay, this recipe uses the perfect amount of ingredients and instructions make for a wonderfully creamy fudge. With that being said, it was HORRIBLY SWEET. Realizing it was too much sugar while I was making it, I used 2 cups of brown sugar and 3 cups of confectioners sugar. Even at that I found it too sweet. I too used 1 C peanut butter (chunky). 

I think next time I'm using 2.75 C of Brown Sugar and 2.5 C of powdered sugar.

There isn't a fudge part of this recipe except in the consistency. It needs chocolate. Way too strong of a peanut butter flavor (similar to eating straight from the jar) for my taste.

I made the recipe as is and it was delicious, but a little too sweet. Next time, I will follow other reviewers' suggestions to increase the peanut butter to 1 cup and decrease the brown sugar and confectioners' sugar to 2 and 3 cups, respectively.

I slightly changed the amounts per other reviews (3 cups confectioner's sugar, 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter) and these turned out perfectly!  I couldn't believe how easy they were and how they taste just like fudge that I've bought for $10+ per pound at bakeries.  Amazing!

The flavor is fantastic. When you cut the fudge it tends to crumble. Apparently we did something different. I probably won't use this recipe again. I will find one that is similar.  Our fudge looks like the picture with the crumbles on the plate.

This fudge was really easy to make! 2 c brown sugar, 1 c peanut butter and 3 c confectioner's just like everyone else.
Delicious.

I cut it into tiny pieces so it'll last longer (smaller portions, less calories).

Awesome- I followed the 2 c brown sugar, 1 c peanut butter, 3 c confectioners' sugar. A little too sweet for me, but still delicious! For those that found it "pebbley" it was only like that for me at first before I put it in my mixer. After only a few seconds in there it was smooth.

Simply put, this fudge is AMAZING! It's oh so creamy and delicious. To make it more peanut buttery, I just doubled the amount. I'm so happy I didn't botch it.

I tried this recipe the other night and was amazed how easy it was. I did have a little trouble getting it to set right. It stayed in a gooey type form and wouldn't harden. Next time I try it I'm going to see if I didn't let it boil good enough and if that will help. Even though I didn't get the right consistency it still tasted awesome, at least the little bit my husband and son allowed me to have.

Amazing fudge!  Wonderfully light and a little fluffy, yet still rich.  I use Smuckers Natural peanut butter, which lends a better PB taste than some of the other types.  I've made this recipe 3 times now, and it always comes out perfect.  I also use the modification recommended in the reviews: 1 cup PB, 2 cups brown sugar, and 3 cups powdered sugar.  Also, start the 2 minute timing as soon as you see small bubbles, and I typically stir constantly while boiling.  So easy, so FAST, and everyone loves it!!

This was my first time making fudge.  I did the recommended modifications. 3 c cofectioners, 2 c brown, 1 c peanut butter.  It was still super sweet - like fudge should be!  Once the butter mixture began to bubble, timed it for 2 minutes exactly.  Used a hand mixer to get out all lumps and sprayed pan with non stick spray.  It set up beautifully and was not crumbly at all.  Perfectly creamy.

This fudge crumbles a little, but that's why I like it. I love creamy fudge, but this recipe's consistency matches that of the natural refridgerated peanut butter I used and tastes more like peanut butter rather than those that use marshmallows. Cut into small squares, it's a super sweet recipe :).

The flavor was amazing! I definitely did something wrong because it did not harden enough. I let it cool for a couple hours then finally *had* to eat some (with a spoon) then the next day it was harder but still not ideal. I did follow the directions carefully. But the flavor was SO good that I will keep trying until I get it right. Everyone that had some loved it, even in the super soft state.

I made this recipe allergy free for my daughter for the holidays and it turned out great!!! She loved it! So did all my family members (especially my husband). I did follow the suggestions of changing the brown sugar, and peanut butter amounts on the first try and it went prefect!!! I highly recommend this recipe, especially for little ones with allergies. I used soy milk, and earth balance butter (soybean butter - no milk) and could not tell anything different about it.

I took the advice of previous reviews and altered the amount of brown sugar, peanut butter, and powdered sugar.  It turned out horrible!!!!  When I was mixing with the beater, it was nothing but small pebbles.  It never turned smooth.  I read a review and the same thing happened to that person as well.  Not sure what happened, but I'll never use this recipe again!

I found this recipe to be very dry and crumbly. Not at all creamy like fudge should be. The taste was meh, nothing to get excited about. Still on the hunt for a good pb fudge recipe.... sigh.

Excellent creamy fudge.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great!  *I did double it and used a 9 x 13, but made no alterations to the ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the easiest recipe for fudge.  I made it for 3 different holiday functions this year so far and it was the first to go everytime.  This is a must try for everyone.

Easy and so good!  I too only used 2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups confectioners sugar and 1 cup peanut butter.  It was so easy I plan on making several more servings for Christmas presents for neighbors!

Just made this last night to try before making for Christmas.  I have to say that this was so easy.  It is very sweet and will try it again with the changes everyone is suggesting.   I used a cup of peanut butter anyway because we love peanut butter.  I didnt get the crumbly affect that everyone else did.  It looked awful when I poured the peanut butter mixture over the powdered sugar and started to stir,  but after beating with a hand held mixer it turned out perfectly smooth and was sooo creamy!  Got rave reviews from friends and family!!

This isn't awful by any means. It is however very sweet. I think next time i will cut the sugars back and increase the peanut butter as others have suggested. This is my first attempt at making fudge and oddly enough this particular recipe is the only one that I had all the ingredients for seein as how it's Thanksgiving today and finding an open store is the furthest thing from my mind i easily decided on this one.  I think the next time I make this I will sift the powdered sugar so that it mixes better and maybe i will melt down some chocolate chips and pour over the top.  Not a bad recipe-just needs a little preferential tweeking. Happy Holidays all!

Really good, I didn't have creamy peanut butter, so used crunchy. I guess I'm more of a regular fudge fan, but for a peanut butter fudge it was really good. Kids liked it and called it caramels.

This is the best fudge I have ever had! I always double the recipe. I also have to hide most of it because the kids head right for it when they get home from school. It sure doesn't last long.

This fudge is pretty good. I think with a bit more peanut butter, it'd be perfect. It's super sweet, so only eat a couple of squares at a time. It's ridiculously easy. I was able to make it when I was feeling blue at random. You should definitely be able to find these ingredients in your cupboard at any time.  Love this!

I made this fudge based on the changes from other cooks, 2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups confectioner's sugar and one cup of peanut butter.  Turned out DELICIOUS.  I also sifted the confectioners sugar, this helps reduce the balling effect and I was able to beat smooth by hand.

It was incredible!  I added 1 C of peanut butter (instead of 3/4), only 2 C of confectioner's sugar (because I was out), and almond extract instead of vanilla, and it was *plenty* sweet ;)  I can't wait to play around with the flavor a little more, and create my tasty variations...

I followed the recipe as given and ended up with sickly sweet peanut butter sand instead of fudge LOL...will stick with my old standard 1 C milk and 3 C sugar..one small jar of PB recipe.  IMO its easier to determine softball stage then it is to measure all those other  ingredients out.

Everything seemed fine up to putting it in the refrigerator. It came out a little hard. Doesn't taste bad, it's just not soft and fudgey. I did line with plastic wrap which was nice. I missed the suggestion about timing the boil so maybe that was the problem. I might try again.

I followed the previous reviewers' advice and slightly altered the measurements to 2 cups bown sugar, 3 cups powdered sugar, and a little over 1 cup peanut butter. This was still definitely sweet, but a very good peanut butter fudge and super easy. I followed the directions exactly and the fudge had a wonderful consistency and appearance.

I did as the other reviewers and this turned out amazingly.  it's not chewy or crunchy but melt in your mouth heaven.  i used becel olive oil margarine as that was all i had on hand and i think i would use a "stiffer" margarine or butter in the future but it despite that it was still awesome and as easy as the title suggests.

'15,  Made again and changed br. sugar to 2 C., XX sugar to 3 C. and peanut butter to 1 C.  Had EVERYTHING ready to go, timed the 2 min. from when I first spotted any bubbling.  Poured peanut butter mixture over xx sugar  and immediately started beating it.  It did not go into crumbly pebbles this time, it beat right into a creamy mixture.  Put into pan I had already prepped w/PAM, foil, Pam, and it started setting up right away.

Like most people I used the 2-1-3 ratio for everything. THIS IS SO GOOD! It's absolutely terrible for your health, but totally delicious!!! I used light crunchy peanut butter and it worked awesome anyways. I am so going to make this for everyone I know.

This was really easy to make, but WAY too sugary, and I reduced the confectioner's sugar to 3 cups, and the brown sugar to 2 cups. It needs to be even less. Other than that I'll be using this recipe. It was my first attempt at fudge, and it went perfectly.

The taste is good, the texture was a bit too sugary.  Not sure if my rolling boil was too long??  Made it with two 5 year old girls and they thought it was great!  Lots of nibbling was done along the way.  Used the saran wrap trick to line the pan and that worked out great.

This was the first fudge I have ever made, and it is incredibly easy, and extremely tasty! I used the 1-2-3 that other reviewers suggested, and the only peanut butter I had was All Natural Peanut Buter Company Dark Chocolate Dreams (PB with dark chocolate mixed in). I sprinkled a handful of PB chips leftover from some cookies on the top after I poured the mixture in the pan and pushed them in while the fudge was still warm.This fudge is in-stinking-credible!

This was quick and easy. Not the type of Peanut Butter Fudge, I was looking for. This is okay for a quick fix. I used the 3 cups of powder sugar - still way too much.

Very yummy!  Smooth and creamy.  I did have to add a splash more milk.  It did not harden like other fudge, which is what I prefer.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong when doing this recipe, but I followed the directions as listed and for some reason, I didn't come out with anything resembling fudge. Rather, I came out with a gooey, chewy mess that vaguely resembled overly soft toffee. It tasted great, but fudge? Not really. I might try this again in the future. I would also cut drastically back on the sugar, because 3 1/2 cups is way, way too much.

I'm pretty serious about chocolate fudge--old family recipe, no shortcuts.  But my peanut butter fudge didn't turn out as well as my chocolate fudge.  So, I tried this recipe.  I was very surprised by how well it turned out.  Easy as can be and a very good result.

OHHHHH MYYYYYY this is so good and so easy. I  made 4 batches thru the Christmas Holidays and used some as gifts in cookie containers. This will take a permanent spot in my Christmas Cookie/Candy recipe collection. Having said that, Christmas is not the only time  of year that I will be making this fudge.

As others have mentioned, the fudge turned out pebbly (more of a a cookie dough texture).  I put it in a pan then in the fridge, then checked back here for ideas.  I heated the entire mixture up, added a little milk and Wha-Lah it smoothed out with a little mixing.  The fudge tasted great after cooling.

Good but a little cake-like.  It wasn't as melt in your mouth as I'm used to.

This should be called "Please Your Landlady Fudge." We couldn't afford to do more than hand out baked goods for the holidays this year, so we settled on fudge. This was, without a doubt, the favorite amongst all our friends. We made it exactly per the recipe above, and, though the texture was a bit crumbly, the deliciousness triumphed. Our landlady was overjoyed. A family friend  who regularly competes in baking contests asked for the recipe. This fudge cannot be denied.

Wonderful recipe!  I doubled it and also did the 3-2-1. I used a candy thermometer and took it off the stove when it reached 230 degrees.  My husband is a very happy man!  Thank you!

I have made this fudge four times, comes out perfect EVERY time. I use a whisk to mix everything to ensure no lumps and a hand mixer with pouring the hot mixture over the sugar again for no lumps. It's SOO smooth and creamy.

I have tried many recipes for peanut butter fudge and this one is the best!  The fudge was nice and firm and it was delcious. I made a double batch and used a 9x13 pan.  The only modification I made was I used half skim milk and half light cream and that is only because I did not have whole milk on hand. Perfect.

I have made this fudge four times in less than a week and everyone is raving about it!  I went ahead with the majority and did 1 cup peanut butter, 2 cups of brown sugar and 3 cups of confectioner's sugar.  The last batch I did add 1 cup of chopped walnuts (a bit less than coarse) and the family thought it was great that way too.  I did cut it into 64 pieces vs 15.  This is a perfect Christmas gift that is so simple to make!

This is the first fudge I ever made, the first batch came out perfect and was so simple I didn't even peek at the recipe the 2nd time and it still came out perfect. Amazing Fudge, I'd give it more stars if I could.

Wow - easy! I did use the 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter ( I used crunchy), and 3 cups powdered sugar changes - but it is just exactly what I was looking for and it's wonderful. I had it cooked, beaten, poured and in the fridge in 6 minutes.  I have looked and looked for a good peanut butter fudge recipe for ages and this is the one! Thanks for posting this!

Yum.  It's the perfect texture (smooth and not chewy at all) and is very tasty!  I added some chopped peanuts too, and think that next time I would sprinkle some on top, too for decoration.

I usually have no luck with fudge- this fudge turned out perfect.  It set up very nicely.  I used the suggested changes of 1 c peanut butter, 2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups powdered sugar.  Will make again!

I don't know what I did wrong, but the butter floated to the top and I had a mess. I tried to drain the butter and decided to let it set and see what happens. It was crumbly, and it tasted like peanut butter and sugar lol. Not the bestest fudge.

I made this fudge for the first time today and it is both super simple and delicious.  Using the recommendations in other posts, I made it with 2c of brown sugar, 1c of peanut butter and 3c of confectioners' sugar.  I also lined the pan with plastic wrap, which made it slide right out.  I prefer my fudge on the soft side, so I started the 2 minute boil timer when it first bubbled in the center and the consistency is perfect.  This will now be my go-to peanut butter fudge recipe.

Super easy to make! I'd never made fudge before, so was a little worried. But now I'm fearless! Really, it was super good. I did use 2 c. brown sugar, 3 c. confectioners', & 1 c. pb like other reviewers had suggested. MMM.

I've never made fudge before. I followed (in good faith) the other reviews and also used 2 c. brown sugar, 3c powdered sugar, and 1 c peanut butter. They turned out a bit dry and crumbly, but I think I let the peanut butter mixture cool too much before adding it to the powdered sugar. And, although a little dry, it's delicious!! I will definitely try this recipe again!

This was good, but tasted way too much like brown sugar. It was super easy, and tasted good, but I wanted more or a peanut butter taste.

Easy to make and didn't turn too 'sugary' as some fudges tend to do.  I loved the great peanut flavor - I used Jif Peanut Butter and this came out great!

Very easy to make (dare I say fail proof?), but VERY sweet as well. The brown sugar is the star here, not the peanut butter, so I don't know that this is the recipe for me.

This was a huge winner for my kids and me.  I followed the recipe exactly, but did notice that I needed to add just a little milk to the mixture at the last step prior to pouring.  It appeared to dry without it, so the splash of extra milk brought it to a smooth texture.      Loved it, thanks!!

I have made this every year for the past 3 years and everyone loves it! This year I took another reviewrs advice and lowered the powdered sugar and brown sugar and added more peanut butter because I have always found this to be a little too much on the sweet side. Hopefully it will still be good! Even made as advertised excellent fudge and super easy!

This was the easiest and best peanut butter fudge recipe ever! It taste exactly like my grandmother's and no one ever came close to her fudge until now! I did as the others did and used 3Cups Confec. Sugar,1Cup peanut butter and 2Cups brown sugar and it turned out perfect,creamy and nice and soft not crumbly which is how fudge should be in my opinion! A real keeper!!

This fudge was very good and came out perfect on my first try (I am not always successful at making fudge).  However, I must say that "World's Best Peanut Butter Fudge" (also on this site) is still my favorite recipe.

The fudge is still cooling, and I'm still picking off the little pieces and chunks that took to flying around the kitchen and attaching themselves to everywhere they landed when I was using the electric beater.  I couldn't even get mixer to med speed cuz the flying objects became like  heat seeking missiles.  If I had put it on high, I'd have taken out my husband, dog, and plants , So, I beat it on just above low. And like in so many more reviews, it was in pieces and chunky, never even made it to clumpy... I followed another survivers review and added 2 tbls milk... It got creamy smooth and sticky... Stuck it in 8x8 pan and put in fridge... It was really sweet, maybe semi sweet choc. frosting might tone it down.. If I can get it out of pan when it cools, I'll taste it again and see if it's worth it,   jwmudd

This came out amazing.  My first try at fudge, this was easy and delicious.  I actually had to substitute 1.5 cups of brown sugar for white,( i ran out of brown sugar lol)  but after adding an extra teaspoon of milk, it turned out creamy and wonderful.

My fudge also turned into little pellets while mixing (with an electric mixer), and had a layer of grease on top. I followed the directions exactly.  Any ideas what went wrong???????

so easy and so good.  started 2 minutes at rapid boil, put 3 cups confectioners sugar in eletric mixer and started mixing and then poured in peanut butter mix...mixed until it started to look like the soft ball stage and stop and then poured in 8x8 pan and flattened out.  SO AWESOME!  Used 2 cups PB and 3 cups of confectioners sugar as suggested..

this fudge is great!  It reminds me more of a peanut butter cookie dough, though.  I would still recommend it.  I only added 1/2 cup of butter, because 1 cup seemed like it would have been way to much.  It came out some what crumbly, but I did not put much effort into it when packing it into the pan for cooling.

Delicious peanut butter flavor!  My final mixture was crumbly instead of creamy after I mixed it, so I added 1/8 c. water to get it to reach the proper consistency to pour into the pan.  My finished product is a teense softer than I'd like it.  Might try and make it a little drier next time, but this recipe is a keeper!

I just made this fudge, I chose this recipe because of the ingredients were what I usually have on hand in the cabinet. I have to say I did reduced the brown sugar to 2 cups and the powder sugar just to 3 cups. It turned out great. It was smooth and creamy, I am sure I added a whole cup of peanut butter though, we love peanut butter! So very easy to make, it set up in no time and was gone in no time too! will make again and again.

I made this as directed. It set up perfectly and was soft and creamy. but for me, it was way too sweet.  I worked on one piece for about an hour!  My husband on the other hand, gobbled up 2 pieces like nothing.  So, it just depends on what you like.  Good recipe though, and sooo easy!  Keeper!

Like other reviewers, we used 1 cup peanut butter and 2 cups brown sugar. The fudge was wonderful in taste but not texture (hence, the 3-star rating). The texture was dry and somewhat flaky. We'll look for another recipe for peanut butter fudge, because creaminess (along with taste) is highly important to us.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and I was not impressed at all, it was just okay. I could taste the powdered sugar stronger than the peanut butter. Next time I will follow some of the suggestions posted by others.

great, fast and easy. i didnt even measure out exactly - just eyeballed the ammounts and it came out perfect!!! my dad, the fudge expert, LOVED it. the trick is CONFECTIONERS sugar, if you use regular crystal sugar, it may not harden. i want to find ideas to spice this up - maybe chocolate or almonds! yum!

This was pretty good and very easy to make. It was a bit "chalkier" than I had hoped for, but the flavor was great.

I have never had much luck making fudge and i was afraid i had fouled this one up when it became so stiff that my mixer couldnt handle it and "pouring" it into the pan was impossible. I decided to press it into the pan anyway to see what would happen and much to my happy surprise, it was quite good! I followed the suggestions that everyone seems to be doing with the amounts of sugars and peanut buter but next time i am going to try it as writtern because I thought it was almost too creamy, if that makes sense. I wasn't sure if this was supposed to go in the fridge to chill or just left out to cool. I put it in the fridge but it got too hard to cut so i had to let it get to room temp. before cutting.

Outstanding! This was by far the best fudge I've ever had. I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions. I used 3 cups of confectioner sugar, 2 cups of brown sugar, and 1 cup of peanut butter. It came out perfect!

This recipe is awesome! I was really nervous since this was my first time making fudge. I followed other reviewers suggestions and changed it to 3C 10x sugar, 2C brown sugar, and 1C peanut butter. It mixed well, spread easily, looks great, and tastes fantastic! Definitely will make this again and again!

I followed the advice of others and limited the confectioners sugar to 3C and brown to 2C but I think the conf sugar should be left alone and not modified. There was a considerable puddle of butter on top post cooling and I had to scrape it off. Regardless, my sons said it was better than grandma's fudge at xmas! It was gone so fast that next time I need to portion it out so they dont get sick. Excellent recipe!

Fantastic fudge. I took this to a party and it had rave reviews. Very creamy and super easy. I did take the other reviewers suggestions and used 2c brown sugar, 3c confectioners sugar, along with 1c peanut butter. I also used my stand mixer to blend the confectioners sugar.

I made this fudge for Christmas this past year and I must say that it was excellent.  I also cut back on the brown sugar to 2 cups and the confectioner's sugar to 3 cups and it turned out just as good.  I saved this recipe in my recipe box and will be making it again next year.

Good, but not like the stuff at the beach.  I like it creamier and a little bit more peanut buttery.  I even upped the pb to 3/4 cup and dropped 1/2 cup of the confectioners sugar and 1/4 of the brown sugar.

I made the mistake of not reading all the reviews and I regret it. Personally, I don't think it's fair that one is allowed to rate a recipe with high stars if the reviewer has made SIGNIFICANT changes to the original recipe. Like some, I ended up with pebbles and nothing even close to pourable. I pressed it into the pan, but don't have high hopes for the end results. I'm sorry for such a low rating. I've usually loved every recipe I've tried, but this one really did not hold up as written.

I made this fudge for Christmas this year and i love it! I had to use skim milk for this recipe but otherwise followed the recipe perfectly. That's all i had on hand. It is the best peanut butter fudge i have ever had in my life. This recipe is replacing my old go to fudge recipe. Thank you so much!

I am a gal who loves to eat.  So please take me seriously when I say this might be the best thing I have ever eaten!  I followed the recipe to a T - with one slight addition, a candy thermometer!  
I made chocolate fudge first so when I got to this recipe I thought the texture looked really off and was concerned.  NO reason to be concerned!  This fudge was part of a Christmas gift basket that I have given several pieces and has met RAVE reviews from one and all!  In fact, I have some left in the fridge to make up one last basket for a few friends I will see tomorrow night, and I can't keep my paws off!  I will need to make another batch!  (What a shame!)  Cheap, easy, decadent and WONDERFUL!!!

Fabulous fudge.  I took the suggestion of many and cut the brown sugar to 2 cups and the powdered sugar to 3 cups.  I sifted the powdered sugar into my kitchenaide mixer bowl and then dumped the fudge mixture into it and beat until smooth.  Sooo bad for you but sooo good!

Very Good!! Like most other reviewers, I used 1 cup peanut butter and cut out the 1/2 cup from both sugars.  Everyone really enjoyed this fudge.

Like others I adjusted the sugars and peanutbutter- but I also replaced milk w/ teh dried milk- I usually do this w/ most recipes that aren't milk based. I hate fudge- really its too sweet, the texture is iffy, adn teh sugar content- shudder....but I make it every yr for teh holidays for others that love it....this recipe I'm keeping for me when ever I feel the need for something not too sweet and easy to make....love it thank you for sharing

Very easy to make!  This is a quick fool proof recipe.  I followed other people's advice and used 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 3 cups confectioners sugar.  It was very sweet so I cut the fudge into smaller than normal sized squares.  Delicious!  Will definitely be making this again.

This is genius! I am not a very good baker AT ALL. However, without sticky marshmallow creme and a candy thermometer--this fudge is just the best, I can't stress that enough! It's easy and I think that's why i've made this 6 times. Seriously- the only problem i've come to find is that it uses a bit of dishes, but that goes for any fudge. Tonight I'm going to try and replace peanut butter with pumpkin since monday is autumn! TRY THIS RECIPE FOLKS. !!

I give to prep a 4 but with the alterations I'd give it a 5 in tast.I found it hard to work with once you add it to the power sugar so I added 1/4 cup more milk and heated it up 2 minutes in microwave, but it turned out great and every one loved it so I;d say it was a keeper

Per the reviews, I scaled down powdered sugar to 3 cups (good thing, it was VERY thick even with this) and upped peanut butter to one cup.

Here is the thing, it tastes JUST like the center of a "buckeye" christmas cookie.  Those are the peanut butter balls dipped in chocolate.  Which I love, but arent quite the same thing as fudge to me.

These are more sweet than peanut-buttery, even with the increase in PB- I can only sort of barely make out the pb taste.  I've been trying various peanut butter fudge recipes on this site and I think  I will keep looking.  Not enough peanut butter taste but not a bad sweet treat overall.

By the way if you use a 8 by 8 pan it make for pretty tall fudge (the picture is accurate).  You could probably use a slightly larger for lower-profile fudge.

This is the first time I've ever made fudge so I was not surprised when it turned out more like a goey mess that tasted like peanut butter!!! I'll have to keep working at it. ***UPDATE*** Finally made it again and used Jif. It did set and the taste was ok. I would use fresh made peanut butter next time. I also wonder if fresh almond butter or Nutella would work. Hmmmm???

This is great fudge! I have tried many recipes for peanut butter fudge over the years and without fail, they all turned out horribly.  But that all changed with this recipe.  It is easy and can be made with a few ingredients.  I didn't have enough brown sugar and used about a half cup of granulated sugar and it was still great!  I really recommend this fudge!

Not the creamiest, but due to the ease and ingredients always on hand, this is a winner.  Not too peanut-buttery, either, which is a plus on some occasions.

I love this recipe!!! SOOOO easy (i followed the previous poster's advice of reducing some ingredients)!! also, i didn't have brown sugar, so i substituted Jif's Peanut Butter and Honey because i noticed it contained molasses and hoped it would work.....well, it definitely did! Next time I will try it with brown sugar and regular peanut butter to see if there is a big difference in taste. :)

Way too sweet for my (and my husband's) taste. I even decreased the amount of sugar I used- 2 cups brown sugar, 2 cups confectioner's sugar (that's all I had, thankfully), and I increased the PB to 1 cup. I give it two stars because my mom and brother liked them.

I'm not sure what I did wrong but it didn't taste like the fudge I was use to! My chocolate definetly didn't swirl and the fat seperated from the peanut butter chips.

OK to be honest i have just made it. it is actually in the fridger right know but. I tryed it with the info of the person before me. It worked. although i had to add hot water to the mixture because it lookes like sand.  But i had realized after that what waz in the pan tastes better and cools faster that with the confectioners sugar.

I made this yesterday afternoon and put it in the fridge to set. Almost 12 hours later and it is still not set. Maybe I didn't boil it long enough. I cut into it and the taste is great. Just very gooey.

This was Great!  I cooked it in the microwave and it turned out really good!  I used the advise of different measurments and I used a couple of spoons of marshmallow cream.  It turned out really creamy and smooth.  I will ad a little more peanut butter next time.

This was my first attempt at candy making...and it turned out good. The fudge was rich and delicious. I followed other posters advice and altered the amount of the ingredients a bit and it was still tasty! I'm glad I tried this, with so few ingredients I will definitely be making it again...:)

I thought this was a good recipe.  I used the adjustments others had made below, I didn't boil for 2 minutes though, I boiled to softball stage (234-240).  This recipe was a bit sweeter than I'd like I think the next time i make it I might try replacing some of the confectioners sugar with marshmellow creme and see how it turns out.

This was very easy to make and forgiving. I cooked the butter and brown sugar for four minutes instead of two and used 2 cups of brown sugar, 3 cups of confectioners sugar, and 1 cup of peanut butter - and it came out wonderful!

Awesome recipe... I did the 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 cup of peanut butter and 3 cups of confectioner's sugar.  I couldn't wait for it to fully set to try the first piece!  So creamy and it melts in your mouth!

I used the modified amounts of sugar and peanut butter and was amazed. This fudge was excellent. I folled the instructions exactly, using an electric mixed to blend the peanut beuuter mixture and the confectioners sugar. Smooth as silk and oh so good. I'm thinking I may try layering it with a bit of chocolate for a "reeses fudge cup". I will make this over and over. Thanks a million!

I used suggested modifications and also added a thick chocolate top made with melted chocolate chips, milk, and confectioners sugar. Really rich, really yummy. (If you live at higher altitude try boiling just under two minutes.)

I followed the recipe exactly, and I when I went to beat the fudge until smooth, it turned into dry pebbles that would not mix together.  Could it be that I live at a higher altitude?  I added about 1 tablespoon of milk to my pebbles and they mixed up smooth. I put the fudge in a dish and chilled it.  The end result was a soft fudge type dessert.  I really did not care for this recipe, but I am sure it has something to do with the problems I had.

I followed other's suggestions and used 2 c brown sugar, 3 c powdered sugar, and 1 cup peanut butter. It was really thick, but set up nicely. It is very good, but you have to like peanut butter to like this fudge. Many people only ate a small bite and that was enough.

Super Easy and Fast!
Made the adjustments:
2 cups brown sugar, 3 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup peanut butter and mixed all ingredients with my mixer then immediately put in a 8x8 glass pan.
Will definately use this again!

This recipe tastes great. I did have a big problem with the sugar turning into hundreds of tiny pebbles, like another reviewer, so I quickly switched to an electric mixer, which helped greatly. It is almost lump-free, but not entirely. The taste is worth it. I highly recommend a hand-held mixer, though. I also used reduced-fat peanut butter and you can't even tell the difference--the powdered sugar is so sweet that the missing sugar from the PB is not noticeable.

Like others I did make adjustments to peanut butter, brown sugar and powdered sugar.  Very easy and tasty.  Definitely a keeper.

This was good but I prefer my easiest recipe which is 1jar peanut butter & 1can vanilla frosting 30seconds each in the microwave and mix together, Yummy!!

I am no longer a fudge virgin!  I was pleasantly amazed at how easy and delicious this recipe was, though I must confess I too changed the ingredients amounts based on previous feedback ratings!  Go for it!

I followed the user comments and used 3 C. confectioner's sugar, 1 C. PB and 2 C. brown sugar.  When I beat the mixture with the confectioner's sugar it never became smooth... not even close.  I added a little milk though and then it was fine (a little milk goes a long way when adding it this way).  Overall it turned out fine, although I think it had slightly too much of a brown sugar taste.

Sets a little soft and is very sweet. However the flavor and the creamy texture more than make up for any cons. NOTE: It sets up very very quickly and it takes a fair few minutes to beat the living hell out of (i.e. get the little balls of powdered sugar out). If at first it is lumpy, beat harder. (Think of the little engine who could!)

This is an easy recipe, however this taste more like a peanut butter penoche (lots of brown sugar flavor and consistency rather than peanut butter).  Also, this is way too sweet and not enough peanut butter flavor.

Very good recipe.  I wonder if last poster accidently used flour instead of confectionary sugar because it should never clump up if the liquid mixture is hot enough.  Otherwise Im not sure what else would cause the brown sugar,milk, and butter mixture to even seperate like that.  Just be careful you grab confect sugar and not flour since they act exactly the same.  :)

Great recipe. Tastes like how you would expect peanut butter fudge to taste. I give this recipe 4 stars only because I had to follow the advice given by other users to adjust the proportions of the ingredients. I made this because I was tired paying for fudge that I could easily make at home and for a price much less. Thanks!

I used the changes mentioned by so many.  It mixed very well.  I had no problems getting it to set.  Perfect!  Personally I thought it wasn't creamy enough.  Too much powdered sugar even at the reduced amount.  I'll keep looking but thanks anyway!

I read the reviews and took their advice.
I just put them in the refrigator and the butter went to the top. I'd sugest using a little less butter because right now their not very smooth and I beated them for about 5 minutes.

I definitely made this recipe with the previous suggestions in mind and did decrease the amount of powdered sugar. It still left small bits of powdered sugar all throughout the fudge. However, my family said it was by very one of the best tasting recipes for peanut butter fude I have tried so far and they didn't mind the imperfection. I am going to experiment and see if I can get those lumps to smooth out!

I did have a little issue of the butter floating on top of the fudge after it was poured in the pan. I had to use paper napkins to absorb it, but once cooled and set it was not greasy ~ creamy and delish. I will definately make it again.

It ended up as pebbles is powder. I don't know what went wrong. It made peanut butter taste nicer than usual though (it's not very nice alone).

This was a disaster. Nothing about this recipe worked for me. Mine never set, and when I tasted it, it really didn't matter because it just tasted like sugar. I would never have eaten it anyway. I followed this recipe exactly so I have no idea what went wrong. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, sorry.

this recipe is awesome. I woke up this morning with a strong pregnancy craving for peanut butter fudge. I've never made fudge before, and after ruining 2 batches (crumbled oily mess)using a different recipe from this site, i tried this as a last ditch effort. i had used up all the fluff i had making the first 2 batches but had everything for this recipe on hand. thank goodness. i followed user review suggestions and used 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup p.b., and 3 cups of conf. sugar. i sifted the confectioners sugar, and only actually had to use about 2 1/2 cups of it to get my fudge to the pefect consistancy. it was too thick to pour but i used a piece of plasic wrap and the flat bottom of a cup to press it into the pan and smooth the top and it came out perfect. thanks so much for sharing, i'll definately make this again!

i love making this... it's so easy and turns out great  i recommend adding a bit of salt, as the recipe calls for so much suger.  usually i add around 1/2 a teaspoon of salt...   careful not to add too much though... i once overdid it and it was too salty :)

I just brought this to a local fair for a baking contest.  It turned out wonderfully smooth and does look just like what you would buy at a fudge shop.  However, I did find it extremely sweet even though I did take the recommendations of cutting down both sugars.  I found I could really taste the icing sugar in it.  I will let you know how it did at the fair.  Thanks for the recipe.

This tastes exactly like fudge you can buy at the candy shoppe. I took the advice of other raters and used 2 cups of brown sugar, 3 cups of confectioners sugar, and 1 cup of peanut butter- used skim milk in the amount specified. This really is terrific but I'm not really a sweet lover, I would have liked if it hadn't been as sweet.

these tasted fabulous.  mine, however, were very crumbly b/c i made them on a humid day.  the advice seems to be very true: don't make fudge in humid conditions or it will be crumbly.  i'm going to try again soon on a dry day and see how it works out. again, the sweet peanut butter taste was out of this world!

I LOVE this pb fudge recipe.  I used to make the kind that used marshmallow creme and I never knew if it would "set up" or not.  I have used this recipe for the last 2 years for Christmas and I'll never go back to the old recipe.  It is very easy and soooooo good.  Thanks!

Just tried this recipe and was a little wary of the sugar content.  After the fudge set, I thought that the taste was excellent.  As a side note, I layered this peanut butter fudge on top of  chocolate fudge.  WOW!  It tasted like the fudge creations you buy at a gourmet store!

This has to be the best fudge I've ever made, not to mention, the easiest!!  My only suggestion is to add closer to 3/4 c. of milk... 1/2c. milk was just not enough and I couldn't beat it at all.  Otherwise, it's perfect and you can't miss on this one.  Thanks.

Peanut Butter Fudge has always been a favorite of mine, but it never seemed to come out right for me when I made it. This was wonderful, very easy to make, very creamy and smooth. It couldn't have been any better.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Well, this goes down as my first kitchen fire! The brown sugar/butter mixture boiled over onto my burner and actual flames came up. Wow! Nonetheless, this recipe came out okay, I think. It ended up making 2.5 pans but maybe I should have put more in each pan. The consistency still isn't firm (it was in the fridge overnight). But I have never been very successful with fudge making (that's why I picked one called "Easiest"). At any rate, most of my problems are user issues, not the recipe. I guess I'll stick with store-bought fudge!

I am a huge fan of peanut butter, and when I saw this recipe, I couldn't resist. I followed the aforementioned suggestions, and it turned out great. This fudge is DIVINE, and I plan on making it as Christmas gifts for my family.

This was pretty good.  Very easy to make.  It sort of tasted like peanut butter cookie dough.  Very heavy and rich.  Great recipe that I will definitely use again.  Eat with caution.  There is sOOOOO much sugar in this small batch.

Wow, it wasn't joking when it said easiest fudge... I didn't know making fudge could be so easy!  I used the mixer to make it really creamy, then added in chocolate chips in one half using the spatula to  mix it in and put them on top of that half.  Thank you for this delicious (not so healthy) recipe. It was gone in a day!

The title isn't lying when it says "easiest." I had to make a second batch because I wrote the recipe down wrong and used too much butter, but that was my fault and not the recipes ;P. The second batch turned out AWESOME. My friends don't really have sweet tooths (teeth?) but even they loved it.

Thank you!  I needed something quick, easy and delicious and this was perfect!  I drizzled chocolate on top for presentation because I didn't cut it ahead of time, but it was delicious on its own.

i first tried this with the different amounts suggested. i think i would have liked the original recipe better, as it wasn't quite as sweet as i thought. as it is, it still tasted very good. smooth texture. easy to prepare.

I think it's really good, I too was rather surprised that such a simple recipe could be so good!  I actually didn't have enough brown sugar so I used->instead...1 and 2/3 cups of dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and 1 tablespoon of molasses.  Really good!

Easy and Good.  I made this for my Mom, she loves Peanut butter fudge and I was not sure how it would taste, but I was surprised.  It was very tasty!

I was looking for something different to make as a treat but yet something that didn't take lots of time, this was it. My husband loves it, plus he loved the fact that it creamy yet it wasn't real sweet like most fudge. It turned out perfect. Thanks, a real winner and one that I will be making again.

Swwweeeeeet!  This fudge turned out perfectly...and fudge is ~not~ my specialty.  I wish I could find a chocolate recipe that would turn out this smooth and creamy!  Thanks!

Very good and very easy. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars was because it wasn't as creamy as I thought it would be. It was still really delicious. I am going to have to go on a diet after eating it all :)

This recipe tastes very good. I followed the recipe and mine came out crumbly. I am by no means an expert at fudge, so it may well have been "user error". It certainly is worth trying again( maybe with the modifications suggested). Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful!! No way to mess this recipe up.  This was the first time I ever made fudge, and it turned out the best!  I used the altered sugar and PB measurements that are in the other reviews, and worked like a charm!

Delicious!  I made it twice. It was too soft the first time, but the next time I added a little more confectioners' sugar... and it was perfect.  If I can just keep my kids away from it... they just love it.

Very easy to make, I followed others suggestions on decreasing the sugar and adding additional PB. I will have to eat something along with this in order for it to not seem so sweet. I can only eat a little at the time...seems too sweet still..but very tasty otherwise..TY

Thanks for submitting this.
My friend's mother used to make this when we were kids, and she wouldn't give out the recipe to anyone.
This is it!
This came out exactly as I remember.

Wow!  Used the suggested changes and it turned out perfectly! Yes, only two minutes of boiling time needed for ideal texture.  Might try adding walnuts next time.

Well I have made this fudge several times with the suggested changes, each time it is a big hit! I have to "hide" some in the fridge for the hubbie as the kids eat it all! Everyone at work keeps asking me to make it. Great, easy recipes, thanks alot!!!!

I followed the suggested changes to cut the sugars and increase the peanut butter and it is excellent.  Texture depends on the type of peanut butter
used.  Today I tried Smuckers Natural peanut butter which is not nearly as
thick as others so I also had to add back some extra powdered sugar. Really
good fudge and it couldn't be any easier.

Texture much drier than regular fudge.  The powdered sugar gave it an undesirable taste and gritty texture.  However, my 10 year old was able to do much of the recipe with minor supervision.

I followed the suggestions and reduced the sugars and increased the PB, as well as sifting my powdered sugar beforehand.  This recipe got rave reviews.  The first batch was perfect, but the second batch set up too fast resulting in a somewhat crumbly fudge, but the flavor of both were amazing. This is a keeper. Thanks!

Wow!  What yummy super easy fudge!!  I followed others suggestions and used 1 cup of peanut butter, 2 cups of brown sugar, and 3 cups of powdered sugar.  I love that the ingredients are things I always have on hand.  I have noticed that if you leave the fudge out, it does get soft, but if you store it in the refrigerator it is fine.  I have already made this many times and will be making it again!

I'm not sure what I did to mess this up, but I did! I followed the other reviewers suggestions and did 1c PB, 2C Brown Sugar, and 3C 10x, and I kept it at a rolling boil for 2 minutes but this just didn't set up properly. I had to put it into the freezer to be able to cut it into squares. Although it didn't set up right, the flavor is out of this world! YUMMY! Hmmm, maybe next time I'll try the original recipe and see if it goes better. Seriously though, if you aren't fudge-disabled like me, give this a try because it is so tasty!

Everybody seemed to like this fudge, except for my husband.  It was my mother in laws favourite of my Christmas baking.  I also increased the p.b. to one cup, decreased the confectioners sugar to 3 cups and did not pack the 2 cups of brown sugar.  I use natural peanut butter so the p.b. flavour was stronger.  It was very easy to make, thanks!

Absolutely terrific, came out great. Had a bit of melted butter left on the top when I was done, next time I would just mop that up lightly with a paper towel after it's been in the fridge for just a few minutes. My guests ADORED it and it is SO easy and very soft!

Was very careful with this recipe and it still came out dry and crumbly. The taste was excellent though and I received many comments on how good it was. If only it was a little creamier.

I had a hard time with this receipe. The fudge set up before all the powdered sugar was incorporated. I had a bowl of what looked like brown sand. After some internet research on fudge, I decided I overbeat it by using a hand-held mixer to beat the sugar in. I fixed it by reheating the whole thing with some half-and-half. After it melted back down, it poured and set up great. Taste is fantastic.

Oh my gosh, this stuff was awesome.  I took the suggestions of others and modified the recipe slightly and it turned out delicious.  I couldn't keep my kids/husband out of it!  Thanks for such an easy recipe!

Tasted pretty good - and I did the suggested changes to the sugar and peanut butter - but it came out very dry and crumbly.

This was my first time making any type of fudge.  This was super easy and turned out great.  I don't even like peanut butter and I thought it was good.  I made this to put in Christmas goody gift bags for the neighbors and it was a big hit!

Thanks Angie, I have tried so many recipes trying to make what I wanted in PB fudge.  This saves money vs condensed milk recipes that I have had to use for a soft texture. Thanks again.

As suggested by other reviewers I reduced the amount of confectioners sugar to 3 cups, reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1 cups and increased the amount of peanut butter to 1 cup and this candy turned out perfectly (albeit a bit sweet for my liking).  This was my first attempt at making anything like this, so it was a very good 'starter' recipe.  The suggestion to use the electric beater to incorporte the peanut butter into the brown sugar/butter mixture is a very good one!

I have been looking for an easy peanut butter fudge recipe and found it.  I use dark brown sugar and people seem to like that more than if I use the light brown sugar.  Either way, it always turns out.  This is creamy and so good, many thanks!

I love this recipe!!  I followed others advice and increased Peanut butter to 1 cup and adjusted the sugars as suggested and it was amazing.  Had it sitting out for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone was complimenting me on how great it was.  I think it is the best PB fudge I have ever tasted.  And it was super simple and quick to make.  Thanks a ton for this recipe.

Simple to make, and delicious. Can't beat that in a homemade fudge! I made this during an ice storm because I had all the ingredients on hand, and loved it. Ended up frozen in by myself for a few days--it was hard to resist gobbling ALL of this up on my own!

I tried this recipe because I wanted to make a peanut butter fudge that didn't use marshmallow creme for a change.  Like many others, I also used 1 cup of pb instead of the 3/4 cup and decreased the amount of sugar.  It came out pretty decent.

I made this several days ago and when my boyfriend tried it, the first thing he said was, "dang!" I was scared for a minute but he continued on and said ,"This is the best peanut butter fudge I've ever had! It's better than my grandma's." This is a great recipe but VERY sweet. Personally, I would cut back on the sugar, but if you have a sweet tooth, you'll like this.

I thought this was a good recipe next time I will probably use less sugar and alittle more peanut butter. I thought it came out the right consistency though it was good.

I haven't even finished it.  It is in the fridge setting.  It may not set but I will still eat it because it is so yummy!!! I followed to advice to up the peanut butter and reduce the sugar.  I didn'have all the vanilla I needed but almost.  This is so good.  Just like the peanut butter fudge  our school cafeteria used to make and that is a huge compliment!!

Wow!! Very creamy and smooth.  Simple and quick recipe with everyday cabnet ingredients.  I followed the others suggestions and sub. 1 c p.b., 2 c. brown sugar, and 3c. powdered sugar.  It seemed to be a bit buttery when finished, but it set up really nice.

This was definitely easy. A success for my first time making fudge. It was too sweet for my taste (and I have a tremendous sweet tooth). And it does not hold up if you don't keep it refrigerated. Other than that, I liked it.

This fudge is wonderful!  It was so quick and easy to make (my first time EVER making fudge.)  It was SO simple- a fool proof recipe!  And it turned out very soft and tasty!  I will definitely make this again and again!

As a rookie fudge maker, I brought this to a boil on HIGH heat... my fudge was crumbly...
I made a second batch immadiately after, leaving the heat on MED and this fudge turned out PERFECT.  My MIL isn't happy with it though cause my fiance said it was so good that he had to slap his momma :)

I did the suggested alterations... tastes great, but is a little soft. Not sure how to combat that, but I'm storing it in the fridge. I sprinkled peanut buter and milk choc. chips on the top. 8x8 makes for a very thick pc. of fudge... I would opt for a larger pan.

Sorry but this was terrible!  It is way too sweet and you couldn't taste the peanut butter.  Even my kids wouldn't eat it and they eat anything sweet and love peanut butter.

Unfortunately, I am going against the popular vote.  It is a very easy fudge, but was WAY TOO SWEET and needed more peanut butter flavor.  Tweaking it a little might add more stars in my vote.

This is the easiest, best Peanut Butter Fudge I've ever made!  I was so tired of the old Fantasy Fudge recipes that were way too sweet & didn't have enough peanut butter taste.  This is perfect.  Thanks so much!

This is the first fudge I've made, and it was indeed really easy with this recipe. I doubled the recipe, using a 9 X 13 pan. Some reviewers have said that this fudge doesn't harden enough, and I guess I can see how they'd say that about the fudge after it has been sitting out for awhile, but it doesn't get *that* soft. Also, I think it tastes plenty peanut buttery. Thanks Angie!

Wow! absoluetly delicious! (But rich!) And SO easy to make! I was short on peanut butter- I probably used just over 1/2 cup, and they were still very peanut buttery. When I make it again (And believe me, I will!) I might leave out a bit of peanut butter. I strongly suggest this recipe!

This was the best peanut butter fudge I have tasted in a long time.  I will serve it Christmas Day, along with my other deserts, to my family.  Many thanks and Happy Holidays to everyone. Shirley
