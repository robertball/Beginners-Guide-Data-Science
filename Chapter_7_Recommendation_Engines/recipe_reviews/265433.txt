This maybe the best soup I've ever had!  The fresh corn and subtle tones of garlic and jalapeño made it unique...I'm a sucker for anything with fresh cilantro!  YUMMY!

7.21.18  Summer corn is in season right now, I found a super sale this weekend, so it was time to try this chowder recipe which has been on my radar.  My corn was super sweet, and gave this chowder great flavor.  The cilantro does give some balance to the overall sweetness, so I’d recommend not omitting it (unless you’re one of those cilantro haters out there).  The only adjustment I made was to add more stock and milk because I had a pot full of veggies with not enough liquid, and I did add some salt.  If you prefer your chowder thicker, just add a cornstarch slurry to it.  Easy enough to make, and will be included on my soup-salad-sandwich summer menus.

Added a bit of cream.   Removed about 1/4 of the final soup and used immersion blender to make creamy. Then added that back to the rest of the soup.

I used Italian Basil in place of the cilantro.  This was a great recipe.  I only changed one herb.  Definitely making this again.
