I made this and I added my left over vegetables from my St. Patrick’s Day meal plus a couple other leftover items and it turned out great.  My husband said “ You can make that again!”;)

A great way to reinvent leftover corned beef into a tasty breakfast.  It was a thin quiche, I think it would be better baked in 3 or 4 small ramekins.   I baked this in the Panasonic Induction Oven (Bake 350) and it took 20 minutes.
