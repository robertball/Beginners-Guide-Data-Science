This recipe is amazing!  I've used this one countless times -- I modify it slightly, using only 1 small onion and sometimes I add a few dashes of Ground Red Pepper to spice it up a bit more.  I cook the chili for about 45 minutes and then throw in the Boca Ground Burger and cook for another 15 minutes.  I've passed this recipe along to several other friends who praise it as well.  You'd never know that it was vegetarian - and SO HEALTHY!

Really good, and I didn't even add the "fake" burger.  Perfect just with the beans.

Excellent recipe with a good "meaty" feel.  I did change a few things.  I chopped three onions, one green pepper and three crushed garlic cloves that I sauteed in a little olive oil (this would also cut down on the bitterness of the onion that one reviewer mentioned).  I also added the crumbles half way through the simmer time as recommended by another reviewer.  I froze up a bunch and will enjoy them for lunch for a while!

This is a great base recipe.  I added fresh bell peppers, fresh diced tomatoes, and a little more chili pepper than required.  I also added some hot cayenne pepper, for quite a spark.  One could probably also add any kind of hot sauce, depending on how hot you want it.  A really great recipe for those really hot nights in the summer, with all your friends, wearing wife beaters, and eating hot chili and drinking tequila and beer.

This recipe is wonderful! I am a college student and have an apartment with 3 other roomates, none of whom are vegetarian. They didn't believe me when I told them there was no meat in it! I did modify the recipe slightly using only 1 can of dark red kidney beans, and only two onions. I also added in long hot green peppers, and instead of plain diced tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes with green chiles. Very wonderful recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe. Although 5 onions seems like a lot, it really helps to add moisture and thin out the chili a bit...but warning it does make a lot! I substituted white beans for 1 can of red beans. Next time I would add a little less cumin and add more veggie crumbles, maybe a little less red beans as well...but it is good.

This was wonderful chili.  No one knew it was veggie meat. This was very easy to make.  I just made way too much of it.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half.

This was a good receipe. I added frozen corn and red pepper to it. My boyfriend only had one complaint, the fake meat was a little too chewy. I would add the meat about halfway through cooking because the meat cooks rather quickly.

This is the only chili I'll ever make.  It is so easy and tastes great.  I serve it with cheddar cheese on top at our annual Super Bowl party...last year one of our non-vegetarian guests told me it was "sublime."  Thank you!

This is the best chili I have ever had! I highly recommended it! The changes I made: Only 2 large onions, 1 green bell pepper, 2 Jalapenos, cayenne pepper and 6 cloves of garlic. I also sauteed all vegetables and garlic first.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it and my non-vegetarian family didn't even realize that they weren't eating meat. I will definitely make this again.

Really great and simple recipe. I made a few adjustments based partly on some of the other reviews.  One thing I'd definitely recommend is cooking the onion in a little olive oil first along with some garlic.  I chose not to add the soy ground "beef" and it turned out great with out it.  It's a nice a simple, and very easily adaptable recipe I'll be making again.

Excellent blend of flavors! I added carrots and substituted fresh garlic for the powder then sauteed all that with the onions prior to adding the rest of the ingredients. I also added a little bit of wild rice to round out the protein and about half a tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes. I used seitan instead of crumbles and added that half way through. It came out as if it had slow roasted beef tips in it.

I thought this chili was sooo good! I don't eat meat, and that is all my boyfriend eats, so it is very hard to find meals that I can cook for both of us. He doesn't even know that there is fake meat in there! I did tweak it a little, because we like our chili spicy.  I used the diced tomatoes with green chili in it, one can of dark red kidney beans, 1 tablespoon of cayanne and dashed red pepper flakes in there to taste!

This is a great recipe!  I strained all the beans and added more tomato juice.  Also added celery and green peppers.  Both people that were over asked for the recipe.  I will make this again and again!  Delish!

Awesome recipe!  I did, however, do some alterations after reading through some of the other reviews here.  I couldn't find any raw tomato juice, so I watered up an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and it worked quite nicely.  I also didn't bother with the bay leaves, used 2 packs of the crumbles, only 1 can of the dark red beans, added celery, carrots, and a can of corn, and about 2 tbsp of brown sugar just for kicks.  Topped off each helping with a dollop of sour cream... YUM!  My husband couldn't get enough of it, and is now saying he wants it once a month.  This is a definite keeper!

This was really good!  Added the meat about 1/2 way through like other reviewer suggested - perfect!  Cooked some rice and put in the bowl before topping with chili and cheese and boy was it tasty!   The crunchiness of the onions was really appealing so add as many as you like! Didn't have any bay leaves, but I didn't miss them!  Will prepare again - easy and family loved too.

Not bad.  I didn't make it vegetarian.  I chose this recipe because of the small list of ingredients that I had on had.  I have a favorite from this site but that one takes much longer and it's a long list of ingredients and steps so for something quick, it did the trick.

Fabulous! I had to adapt the beans & tofu to what I can get here, but the seasoning is great. I use only 2 Tbsp. of chili powder because my husband doesn't like things spicy. Thanks for a great recipe.

This chili was awesome!  I am newly Vegan so I do need to get used to veggie burgers.  I could not find crumbled veggie burgers so I used a package of the patties I had in the fridge.  I also only had 1 tablespoon left of chili powder so I put in a packet of taco seasoning, which I think made the sauce a bit thicker.  Also only had 1 tablespoon of cumin, so to make is spicier I chopped up a jalapeno.  Even my husband, who is an avid meat eater, ate a whole bowl after trying a few spoonfuls of mine.  I was terrified to switch to a vegan lifestyle, but am so happy to find that there are delicious and filling options to satisfy any meat craving need.  Thank you to the poster, you made my day!

5 stars with one modification: tomato paste. I used a little less beans, so maybe that was a factor, but the chili wasn't as thick and the major thing, it lacked something. Tomato paste is the missing flavor. I also only used 2 onions, 5 would have been way too much. I added the faux meat at the beginning, but next time I'll add it towards the end. Thanks for sharing!

The best chili I have EVER had! I topped it with cashew "cheese", Tofutti's "Better than Sour Cream", and a splash of TACO sauce... I ate until I reached the "omgimgonnaexplode" state. It's even SUPERB as a leftover and stands freezing VERY nicely.

This recipe serves as a great starting point.  I prefer to make mine in the crockpot, using dried/soaked beans. For a non-soy option that adds meaty texture, I add finely chopped baby portobello mushrooms.  Like other reviewers, I add chopped bell peppers (all colors work great) and fresh garlic, rather than garlic powder.  Adding brown sugar and corn a nice variation.  I add a half a cup of uncooked quinoa for the last 30 min of cooking time for added nutrition and texture.  May need to add 1/2cup of water at this point if the liquid level low in crock.
Leftovers can make "Chili Pie." Pour chili in rectangular (larger) casserole dish.  Cover with layer of shredded cheese, then top with jiffy cornbread mix (prepare mix as directed on box).  Bake at 350 until cornbread golden.

Thank you SO much for this recipe, it is suprisingly delicious.I made a half batch and it was still alot. I accidentally used tomato sauce instead of tomato juice so it was a bit dry so I added about a cup of veggie broth. Was still outstanding.

So good, so easy.  I have tried many variations on veggie chili in the past, but this one is the best.  I modified slightly and used only 2 onions (and it's still plenty) and doubled the meat substitute instead of using the light kidney beans.  My boyfriend is a meat eater and still eats a heaping bowl whenever I make it.  Success!

It was, in picky husband's words, "almost like Mom's". So yeah, we'll be making this again a lot. I only made half the recipe and it still turned out excellent and with leftovers. It's not spicy, which husband prefers, but I can see sneaking some hot sauce or jalapeños into my bowl.

awesome!  I used soyrizo because I didn't have the meatless crumbles.  I added much more beans, lentils and veggies in my chili - this is an excellent, versatile dish.

I found this recipe neither bad nor particularly good.  Due to the canned beans, the texture was too mealy and chewy although the flavor was good.  I wouldn't repeat this one.

I made this recipe today and I'm so glad I did. Just by looking at the quantity of ingredients I knew it was going to be too much. I adjusted the amount so it would be enough for 2 people with a little leftover. I didn't add any fake meat but I did add a little cayenne pepper and diced yellow bell pepper. the canned tomatoes i used also had some diced zesty green chiles, which just added to the flavor. Next time am going to try using a meat substitute and less chile powder. I added too much but it was all good. Still very yummy. Topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese and a piece of toasted rye bread. Easy to make, delicious. I recommend anyone to try it. soooo good!

I'm not a big fan of the vegi burgers so instead I added cheese (humane) and mac noodles.  Tadaaa!  Chili mac!  Throw a little cayene pepper in for some heat if you like that sort of thing.

I made this for my family and a few of meat lovin' guy friends and they didn't believe me when I told them it was vegetarian! I had to show them the mock meat packages! I made a few minor adjustments, I added one can of chick peas and added 6 tbs of chili powder, I also added only one onion because more then that seemed excessive. As well as excluding the cumin. A very good recipe to go off of and make your own!

This recipe is fantastic! I made it pretty much according to the instructions, but I also put in a large jalepeno pepper, sliced, for a little kick, which worked out great. The recipe as given does make a large amount of food, fyi- seems like WAY more than 6 servings! Anyway, can't recommend it highly enough. A huge hit!

This was easy and delicious and my family loved it. We each had a bowl of chili with a large salad for dinner. I froze about half of it and it was just as tasty (if not more so) when defrosted and reheated a couple weeks later. I added shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream on each serving. It went over very well!

I thought this was better after sitting for a few hours.  I cooked it in the morning and served it for dinner.  I also added 3 to 4 tbsp of brown sugar and a few dashes of hot red pepper during cooking and it adds a little spicy sweet taste that is delicious!

I've made this twice. We like it. My kids finish their bowls. I don't let on to hubs that there is no meat in it and he loves it! Usually I buy the Mexican spiced crumbles so I adjust the spices somewhat. The first time I made it, it wasn't thick enough for me so the second time I left out the tomato juice and added in about a 1/4 cup of concord red grape juice just at the end. Very yummy. Thanks for sharing!

One word: Yummy! Perfect level of spices (would say it's mild), the veggie burgers give it a real hardiness... and the onions.. OH the onions! They were just fabulous!! Next time: make it a "medium" spice level, top with sour cream, serve with corn bread.

Excellent recipe.  I added just a touch of green and red bell peppers and cut the recipe in half.  Waaaay too much food.  There is NO way you would guess this is vegetarian.  Very tasty!

I made this for my meat-loving relatives and they loved it.  They couldn't tell it wasn't meat.  It was easy to make and very filling.  I recommend it to everyone.

I am a nutritional educator and use this recipe to enlighten my clients about eating 1 meatless meal a week.  They are very surprised to hear that this is a vegetarian chili and they really like the taste and the ease of making it. Thanks

My husband doesn’t like chili, and even he thought this was good. I doubled the crumbles, cut the onions to two, and substituted six cloves of garlic for the garlic powder. I sautéed those three ingredients together and then added the remaining items. I also added four or five drops of Tabasco and 1-1/4 tsp of salt. This will become a permanent fixture in my recipe box.

My husband made this veggie chili last night. All I have to say is "WOW...DELICIOUS!!" We tried another recipe before and  it was not good. This is now on my favorite list.  The only thing he changed was adding 4 onions instead of 5. Try this recipe. You will love it!!!

This is my go to recipe!  I omit the tomato juice and usually brown some stew meat. I up the cumin too. 

I usually leave out the meat crumbles for my vegan friends, they prefer it with just the beans!

A simple basic recipe that allows for easy modifications.  I added a spicy pepper, and sauteed the onions first with some fresh garlic.  And I omitted the fake burger stuff. Then the game-changer: I added Worcestershire sauce (non-vegetarian).  Ended up delicious.

This recipe was delicious, but it makes a ton! I would estimate at least 16 X 1 cup servings.  This is just me eyeballing it without measuring.  I wound up freezing half of it which is future peace of mind for a rainy day.  If I could adjust one thing, I would decrease the spiciness, but only by a tad for my palate.  Everyone else in my family was OK with the spiciness level.  I notice it gets spicier on day two after the flavors marinate overnight in the fridge, so something to keep in mind if you're cooking ahead for company.

I just prepared this recipe for a gathering at my church as we do not use meat during the season of Lent.  It was very well received.  I did saute the onions prior to putting them in the stock pot.  I also used tomatoes with onion, celery and bell pepper included for flavoring.  Some worcestershire sauce helps to develop a meaty flavor.

This was really good.  I dont like onions that much so I just used 1/2 white onion.  I also halved the whole recipe and did not use Boca crumbles ( didn't miss them at all).   Again, very good.  Best vegetarian chili!

Our new favorite chili recipe. It is really, really good. I was hesitant to add tomato juice, but it works! Modifications made: didn't add 5 onions? seemed a bit much. 1 1/2 big onions plenty. Added a chopped green pepper and 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots for a bit of sweet. 1 can instead of 3 cans of kidney beans. But really good!

Loved this! Made a few changes: I added 1 can of white kidney beans, rinsed and drained. I added 1/2 bag of frozen corn. I used 1 can of tomato sauce in place of the tomato juice. I only used 3 onions which was plenty and I used 2 Tbsp of chili powder, which was enough for us and our young child but I did add 1 small can of diced chili peppers. I planned on adding the fake meat but after getting everything in the pot I decided it really didn't need it. I served it with a bit of cheese sprinkled on top and some chips on the side. So so good!

my family never knew that it was vegetarian!!!  Followed the recipe exactly with these exceptions... used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chili's (rotel), decreased the onion down to one (sauted it in a little olive oil before adding the remaining ingredients, and added one can of whole kernel sweet corn and 2 TBS instant coffee.   Such a healthy, hearty dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow this is very similar to the Chile i make. Very simple i just made it tonight. I use Chile beans, adds a little more flavor and saute a jalapeno with the onion. Also instead of tomato juice i use a can of Mexican tomato sauce adds a little kick.  Have never used bay leaves may have to try next time.

Absolutely delicious and real easy to make. I think the cumin is a bit too much has a little kick to it but its good. Next time I cut down the cumin though.

This is my go-to veggie chili recipe! I subsitute one can of dark red kidney beans for white cannellini beans for more variety. It's great for freezing as well. I suggest reheating the chili on the stovetop as opposed to the microwave. Microwaving it just sucks out all moisture. I serve with cheddar & sour cream. Thanks for the recipe!

This chili recipe is the best!!! I am new to being meatless so I was nervous about the veggie crumbles but they looked like the real thing and actually fooled some of my meat-eating friends! I put it in the crockpot on low for 6-8 hours and it was so good! I also froze the extra for on-the-go meals...excellent!

I prepared this yesterday, Sunday 12/20/09, as instructed, except for adding the faux burger crumbles about half way through cooking as others suggested.  I used Morning Star crumbles.  A taste before adding the crumbles was a 5-star taste.  After the crumbles, not so good.  I will make this again but maybe try another brand of faux meat crumbles or leave it out altogether.

Excellent recipe.  You can't even tell it's vegetarian.  I like to add extra vegetables like red and green peppers, celery and whatever else is in my refrigerator.  I also like to add jalapeno peppers to make it spicier.  Makes a lot of chili.  I freeze most of it.  Such a good soup for the winter.

I made this for my son (newly vegetarian, age 19) and husband (non-veg) and they loved it. I used only one onion because my son is not an onion lover. I followed the recipe pretty closely. Like everyone said, it makes a ton of food, so be prepared for left-overs for awhile. In re-reading this info, on a freezing cold October day in Colorado, by golly, I'm heading to the kitchen to make it AGAIN. Thanks for sharing the recipe, julieliz!

This was the first time I've ever made any type of chili and it was perfect! I changed a couple of things by a little bit but kept all of the ingredients and it was delicious. I want to eat it every night.

This was a good recipe if you are in the mood for a traditional type chili (but veggie). I did enjoy this and the leftovers were tasty as well. To me it just needed a bit more such as bell peppers or other veggies but I realize that this is personal preference.

I modified this recipe just a bit, and it was great.  Before using the soy crumbles, I cooked it with some soy sauce and a dab of olive oil for about 3 minutes.  I also used a bag of frozen chopped onions instead of fresh onions.  I added:
1 can cannelini beans
1 can diced tomato
1 can tomato paste
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 cup frozen corn
1 green bell pepper

This made the chili serve 10 and added a lot of color and flavor to it.  I think jalepenos would be a good addition as well.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

I halved the recipe, but still used 2 cans of tomatoes. I subbed a can of chili beans for  one of the cans of kidney beans. I also added 2 tsp of turmeric and a tsp of oregano. Turned out perfect! Tasted just like the chili I remember before becoming a vegetarian.

This chili was very good.  I added more chili powder than called for, and the addition of about a 1/8 cup hot sauce.  The spice level was perfect.  Good when served with a light beer.  I also made cornbread, a suprisingly nice combo.  Also, I usually do not go for the veggie crumbles (when I have added them to other dishes- such as manicotti, they seem to alter the overall flavor and detract from the dish).  They were great in this chili, and like other reviewers have said, I think most meat eaters would be fooled by the addition of these crumbles.  Overall, very hearty, thick (but not too thick) and just very good.

This is the first chili I've made that my husband has liked. I don't think I'll ever make another chili. But it makes a lot!  
  I left out the crumbles and cut the beans down to 3 cans.  Changed the tomato juice to bloody Mary mix, only used 1/2 of a large onion and added some green pepper and my husband added beef to his portion.

Very good, I didn't put any onion, as I can't stand it, but I added some diced carrot, a couple of halved jalepenos pulled out at the end like bay leaves, and used half of the meat substitute.  I had to add a bit of liquid a couple of times as it began to dry out, but it was no problem.  Overall, delicious with a bit of cheese on top and served with baguette.

I often wondered how a recipe with all high ratings could get rated poorly by one or two people.  This happened to me this time.  I use burger crumbles often and love the taste.  This chili tasted bitter. No one liked it.

I put in 2 onions (when it became clear that 5 would be ridiculous) and it was soooo gooood.  Not only the best vegetarian chili I ever had, but right up there with the best chili period.

Great recipe. I added red peppers, corn, zuchinni and tofu. Next time I will not add the tofu but this recipe gives alot to work on. I would also cut it in half next time. I live by myself and it took me 10 meals to finish it off!

This was a really good recipe! Very think chili though, so I couldn't even fit in all of the onions required. The meat substitute went great though...and also I only added about 2 Tbsp of chili and found that was good enough for me. V. recommended to try!

My husband and I recently decided to go to more plant based meals and I was VERY nervous about this chili but holy moly, it was absolutely outstanding. We couldn’t tell the difference between the faux beef and the real stuff in this meal. I added 3 stalks of celery and a jalapeño chopped teeny tiny because I had them laying around. This is 100% going into our monthly rotation as we continue to explore vegetarian meals.

I love it.  I have made this recipe many times and many don't even realize there is no meat in the dish.  In addition, I have also made this recipe with dry pinto beans.  The work just as great!

Really good chili. I added some sriracha sauce to my bowl because my husband doesn’t like spicy food. He enjoyed the chili very much too. I will be making this again.

With a few tweaks, this recipe is great. I don't use the veggie crumbles, the beans are enough for this chili. Also, five onions is WAY too much! I use two medium ones and that's plenty.
Once I figured out those changes, this became my favorite chili recipe. So, so good with homemade corn bread.

My 12 yo and I LOVED this! Modifications: one large onion and 3 garlic cloves sautéed in olive oil. I added the herbs and then the tomatoes. I didn’t have light kidney beans so I used cannelloni beans instead. I also added black and white pepper with the salt after adding the beans. I also didn’t have tomato juice, so I used veggie stock to water down tomato sauce. It all worked- delicious!

DELICIOUS!!   Used only 2 onions.  I sauteed them in a bit of oil before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Used only 1 can of red kidney beans and 1 can of black beans and it was more than enough!  Used 2 tsps cumin, 1 tablespon plus 1 tsp chili powder,  1-1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  Thanks for posting this fabulous recipe!

I made this for a Halloween potluck.  There were 4 other kinds of Chili, also.   Mine was the only one completely finished. People raved about it.  The only person that knew it was vegetarian was my husband.  I made it following the directions. Whenever I try a new recipe I follow instructions first and then modify it if necessary the next time.  I won’t be making any changes to this one.

I pretty much followed the recipe except I took other reviewers advice and added the soy for only the last ~25 minutes of cooking. No bay leaves either and less onion. Fantastic, easy chili that's vegetarian and low cal.

It’s a good recipe but 5 onions is wayyy too much, it makes it too bitter, instead do 2 or maybe 3 but no more than that

I've made this twice. The first time without ground meat substitute and the second time with it. My husband and I both agree that it is better without.

I made this recipe tonight. I added chili beans both black and kidney that already had spices. Plus I added corn mixed with portobellos and peppers.

Super easy and cheap to make!  I only used one onion and cooked it first for a few minutes in a little bit of oil before adding everything else on top. That was plenty of onion for my tastes. Delicious and easy recipe!

This is a great vegetarian chili recipe! Full of flavour! I did not add in the frozen burger style crumbles as it has enough beans, I also added some more chili powder in just to preference . Great dish full of protein and fibre! Enjoy!

Great idea.  Surprised everyone and made this.  Next time I will drain all the beans to cut down on moisture content.  Perfect for our chili and chips routine.

Absolutely delish. I didn't make any changes. I used 12 ounces of veggie beef and told not one of my carnivores that it was vegetarian. So far.. 3 others love it. My teenager has had 4 bowls. My mother in law refuses to eat veggie meat, yet she devoured a bowl. Success for this new vegetarian

this is a recipe that satisfied (expanded xs 5) 40 people of various ages and persuasions with leftovers. Many did not believe it was vegetarian.  The spice effect was mild enough for young children while interesting for adults.

Excellent version.  I omitted the soy crumbs, and added some corn.  Very tasty.  We've had it for lunch four days in a row, and haven't gotten tired of it. You really don't miss the meat at all as this is hearty.

This is a pretty good recipe, easy to make and alter.  I used the veggie crumbles and the kids didn't even notice.  Usually they do.  I only put in half of an onion and one can of white kidney beans, added 1 cup of vegetable broth, may have altered the spices a little and added a dash of tabasco and jalapeno sauce.  I would definitely make this again.

I liked this recipe minus the cumin and "burger" (personal taste preference).  I added zucchini and corn to add more color to it and crushed red pepper flakes for heat. I will definitely make again.

We loved this! Sautéed 3 onions & some fresh green and orange pepper, then added 3 cloves fresh garlic & dry spices for about 1 min (Cooks Illustrated tips) and put the veggie crumbles in late as suggested. Also cut beans by one can of black cause it seemed like enough. It was perfect!

This is a fantastic recipe, but it calls for too much cumin. Reduce or omit it. Otherwise, it is wonderful! The two carnivores in the house happily devoured it!

I just started the whole vegetarian lifestyles. Great recipe!!! I added in some corn to have some more vegetables. Left out the fake meat. I also added some crushed red pepper flakes and paprika. I also only used 3 onions. Tastes wonderful.

Loved the idea of making my own chili spices instead of using packaged mix. Left out the onions and the crumble. Threw everything in the crock pot and let is stew on low while at work. Came out delicious!! Tried it again with a pound of ground beef and tastes just as yummy!! This is my go to chili recipe now

We loved this, Used chili beans, one large onion, dash of  sriracha, ancho chili, hot and regular chili powders.  Also added whole peeled organic tomatoes, diced tomatoes with green chilies, and sliced stewed tomatoes.  The best chili ever.  We won't use another chili recipe ever.

I made this last night and... OH BOY!!!  I did put my own twist however.  Instead of meat substitute, I used two cans of chick peas pulsed in the food processor to look like ground beef.  The rest is my little secret!  It was so good that you could put a bowl of it on top of your head and slap yourself silly with your tongue trying to eat it!!

This is a great veggie alternative chili. I used some fresh veggie burger as the meat substitute, it came out great. I used shallots (5) instead of traditional onions and switched out the red kidney beans for whole kernel corn. I made the chili very colorful and attractive. Also, I didnt have tomatoe juice in my pantry so I used condensed tomatoe soup with the water added and just used half. Again turned out great.

Excellent recipe. I only had one large yellow onion. I also didn't have any tomato juice so I added 1 cup of my favorite Salsa and added a little liquid to my pot. It turned out terrific! Highly recommend with or without Boca crumbles.
A big 5 stars

This chili is great!  My vegetarian boyfriend LOVES it.  Goes great with cornbread.  I make a few minor adjustments.  I only use 2-3 onions (depending on how they look that day.  I tend to use sweet onions), and I also add fresh jalapeno peppers and some dashes of cayenne and chipotle to kick up the spice factor.  Yum.

Awesome recipe!!! My son and husband, who are not vegetarians, loved it! Just enough spice for me. I didn't put in 5 onions as that seemed a little crazy to me, but other than that I followed the recipe as it is. In fact, I'm making a batch in my crock pot right now! Great for these Maine winters!

This was very good and quick. I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, added 1-2 teas. of Cayenne pepper (since we like spicy). Held the bayleaf, and ended up adding more tomato juice.

This is such a good chili. Don't fret if you don't have all the ingredients! Things can be substituted or omitted. For instance I didn't have tomato juice on hand so I used tomato paste and water.

I only put 2-3 onions in at a time, and add 2 packages of crumbles because I like meaty chili. Overall it's a great recipe and I've used it 3 times already.

This recipe was so good! But I did not put the fake meat in it. I fed it to all meat eaters. And they loved it. Someone said they wanted to lick the pan. I only put 2 onions in it and that was enough. It made alot so it would be good for a cook-out or to freeze some.

Delicious!  I jazzed this bad boy up a bit by adding fresh bell peppers (red and green), fresh garlic, jalepenos, and some cayenne pepper.  Spicy goodness.  Makes a huge batch.

Very good. Only change I made was to zip it up a bit. I added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with habaneros. My daughter still didn't think it was hot enough, but I thought it was really good

This was really good, my friend and I tried making it and it was really easy. We didn't use any meat substitute at all, but we still didn't miss the meat.

I made this chili in a slow cooker using Morning Star Brand soy crumbles and made up and added 2 of my dad's special chili gravy and it was truly out of this world amazing and delicious.   I served it as part of a "Customize Your Own Bowl of Chili Bar" at the Surprise 70th Birthday Party my boyfriend and I threw for my mother this weekend. It met with rave reviews from our guests.  Even with out the addition of my dad's chili gravy, it's a great recipe and the recipe author is correct, "They'll never know it's vegetarian!" My guests had no idea and were really surprised when I told them that in addition to being delicious  that it was healthy for them and free of animal protein.

Delicious!  I am a recent vegetarian and this satisfied my desire for meat.  The longer you cook it, the better it tastes.

This was the first vegetarian meal that I served to my Mr-Meat-and-Potatoes-turned-vegetarian husband and I have to give it 5 stars because he LOVED it! I left out the wanna-be-burger stuff, substituted cayenne powder for chili powder, and substituted fresh garlic for garlic powder. His exact words were "I almost miss the meat in the chili but even without it this is GOOD!"

I cut this in half, because it makes A LOT.  Just threw everything in the slow cooker and let it go....came out GREAT.  Even my carniverous husband liked it, which is a small miracle.  Bravo!

We couldn't find the "beaf" crumbles.  So we bought boca burgers and crumbled them up.  It made a BIG pot of really good chili!

I used 7 large tomatoes in place of the canned tomatoes and tomato juice.  I also added a few dashes of Tabasco sauce.  Fabulous recipe!  Thank you!

Great base recipe... I think everyone has their own opinion of how much they want to spice it up!  Also left out the fake meat... sometimes that can gross out non-vegitarians.

I liked this recipe a lot. I made it once as it says and it was a hit. I made it again for a dinner party and had some last minute guests call so I had to spread it for more people. I chopped two large yellow peppers and one red pepper and substituted fresh diced tomatoes for the canned so I used half the tomato juice. Also used santa fe flavored veggie patties. Turned out excellent, I'm going to keep experimenting with this one

Amazing.  I made a whole pot of this stuff and within a week my dad and I had finished it off.  Great vegitarian alternative (which my dad and I are) and very healthy.

This was really good.  I added 3 onions instead of 5, and probably could have just gone with 2.  But it was nice to find a vegetarian version of chili.

This is very easy to make, and tastes very good as leftovers as well.  I omit the tomato juice and add some green peppers, and eat it with shredded cheese on top.  The key is the burger-style crumbles, to make it feel more meaty.
