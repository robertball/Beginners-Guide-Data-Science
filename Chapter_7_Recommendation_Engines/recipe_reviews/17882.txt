I would have given this 5 stars, but went with 4 because it needed to be tweaked. Add extra carrots, lentils and potatoes, reduce flour to 1/2 c. and liquid to 3 Qts. and omit the olive oil and bouillion and you'll end up with a much heartier and healthier soup! Be sure to cook on low, low heat and stir often. I also used chicken broth for 2 qts. of the liquid and salted to taste after cooking because I wasn't sure how salty my bacon was. I'm not a big fan of thyme and 1/2 tsp was enough for me. I also used a teaspoon each of powdered onion and garlic, no fresh. Guess that was alot of tweaking....

I doubled the amount of lentils and tripled the amount of potatoes and there was still plenty of broth to handle the increase.  This soup is very tasty, but at almost 13grams of fat per serving (that is 50% fat!), I would hardly call it "healthy" despite the healthy lentil and vegetable ingredients.  For this reason, I decreased the bacon to 4 slices and added only 1 teaspoon of olive oil, instead of the 4 tablespoons called for.  I still found the soup to be rich and tasty.

Did not care for the flour - soup tended to stick and needed constant attention while simmering - I prefer to add cornstarch to thicken at the end of cooking time.

Excellent.  I was generous on the portions of potato, onion, celery, and carrot.  Used canned beef broth over bouillon - just adjusted water accordingly.  Served w/the Whole Wheat Beer Bread from this site - best lentil soup I have had.  Thank you!

LOVE THIS SOUP!!!!!!  We recently visited a Reinlanders and had this soup.  My husband liked it so much he had to find out how to make it.  Everyone we served it to loved it too.

This is a great soup recipe.  My entire family enjoyed it and it was easy to make.  I was out of dried Thyme, so I used some dried Rosemary instead.  It was delicious and I will definitely make this soup regularly.

Wonderful recipe for my toddler. Just omitted the bacon and salt and used low-sodium broth, and it made a very healthy soup for him.

With just a couple of changes, this was a very satisfying soup.  I omitted the olive oil and flour, used 1-1/2 cups of lentils, used about 2 quarts of beef broth + 2 quarts of water, and added one can (15 oz.) of diced tomatoes and about 3 cups of shredded cabbage.

Basic Rating is 4.5 stars. I've made this basic soup for many years and usually make a double batch.  More veggies and less bacon is fine.  I generally cook all but potato for 2+ hours and add pre-cooked diced potato (and potato water) in the last time before serving; keeps the potatoes from going to mush.  Broth in place of water is a good choice.  A robust, mostly veggie recipe that is always good.   Chef Mager's Rhinelander has been around for ages.  It used to be a wonderful, fun place, but nothing lasts forever.  I don't go there any more, but I do make this ROBUST soup often.  Be bold: Add things!

I loved this recipe.  I used ham instead of bacon because I had it on hand.  I also used more salt than the recipe called for and added some black pepper to taste. The thyme gives this soup a fabulous taste, and I will definitely make this again.

To make this soup healthier without losing any flavor, cook the bacon alone in your soup pan till its very well done. If you stir often and cook over med heat it won't burn. All the fat pieces should be a dark golden color. Then drain all the fat out of the pan and add in the veggies. Add a bit of water or stock to deglaze the pan and help the veg cook. Then follow the recipe as written. Viola, no bacon fat, no extra oil.

Easy and simple recipe.  I used freshly made chicken broth and did not add the potatoes just because I didn't have any.  Based on lots of reviews saying that they needed to add lentils and more veggies, I took the other route and only used about 6 cups of broth and it was fine.

Made this soup today and it is very bland. I usually follow a recipe to the letter the first time, which I did. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll use chicken broth instead of water, no bouillon and figure out other spices that provide flavor. I'm very disappointed with this recipe.

I have to admit I was very leery of lentil soup - I'd never had it before but just happened to have some lentils in my pantry that needed to be used.  I did make several changes to the recipe, but it turned out just delicious.  I did not use the olive oil, as the bacon drippings provided enough grease to saute the veggies in.  Left out the flour and nutmeg, and substituted 28 oz. crushed tomatoes for the potatoes.   I also added just under a cup of red wine.  Such a rich flavor, and very economical to make.  The soup is so hearty, my meat eating man even enjoyed this.  I'm hooked on lentil soup!

I've made this soup many with little changes here & there, however the best thing to do is cook it, let it cool than put in the refer overnight. reheat the next day for dinner. Tastes much better.

Excellent soup recipe.  I grew up going to the Rhinelander and loving this soup.  I used organic beef broth as a substitute to bullion cubes.  You could easily omit the bacon and use vegetable broth for a vegetarian option.  I stirred every 20-30 minutes to prevent sticking on the bottom.  Towards the end I covered it because the potatoes and carrots were not tender.  Turned out wonderful in the 3 hours.  Next time, I will try the crockpot.  I have made other lentil soup in the crockpot that turned out great so this would be no exception.  The only thing I noticed while eating is that the Rhinelander has leeks in their lentil soup but it was still pretty close.  Everyone we made it for raved about the flavor.  A great hearty soup for a cold day!

By far the best Lentil soup recipe.  The flour and potato add a lovely texture of creaminess not found in Lentil soup; the nutmeg and white pepper are subtle and interesting flavor notes.  A wholesome and healthy soup that will be enjoyed by all!  More lentils may be added, yet the original recipe will not be compromised.

i know this soup isn't low-fat, but i feel good about eating it!  i added a bit of leftover ground beef (my husband is the carnivorous type), but other than that made as is, and we loved it.  i recommend simmering for the full three hours- the lentils need it to make the soup nice and thick.  besides it makes your house smell soooooo good.

I like my soups thick and hearty, so I only used twelve cups of water. I also didn't have celery and carrots on hand so I used frozen peas and carrots instead. I doubled the amount of lentils and tripled the potatoes as suggested in another rating. I also used 4 bouillon cubes and half a package of lean bacon. The soup came out wonderfully and will definately make it again!

The name of this soup got my interest! My mom was born in Rhinelander Wisconsin so I just HAD to give it a try. 
This is a wonderful soup! My 3 yr old son even loves it! I made it exactly per this recipe and didn't think it needed any alterations what-so-ever! I made a pan of focacia bread to eat along with it and it was an excellent meal! Thanks for sharing!

Love this soup, it has become a family favourite! Add one or two more cups of lentils to make a thicker soup, but everything else is perfect.

Tasty and filling! I made a batch of beer bread (a classic college student recipe, haha) to dip in it and it was great! I can't believe I got my roommates to eat something without meat.

A very good soup.  Probably should allow a little more time to soften the lentils as they are a very hard bean.  Like others, I doubled the amount of lentils but basically this is a very good recipe.  Will make it again.

Very good soup!  I added some extra veggies and skipped the salt since the bacon is already salty, and it was just fine.  Very easy to make and a great comfort food.

Tis recipe was basically very good.  I made a few modifications and it came out really good.  After thinking about the water to lentil ratio I increased the amount of lentils to 1 1/2 cups.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes, juice and all. Also the ratio of salt/bouillon to water and veggies was in my opinion to little.  I passed on the salt alltogether and used chicken bouillon in powdered form.  I put in about 1/4tsp for every 1 cup of water.  I was out of both thyme and white pepper.  So I passed on the thyme and used black pepper instead.  Also I added six cloves of garlic, two handfulls of fresh spinach, and a few fresh green beans for pizazz. Another thing I did was add another cup of carrots.  My 4 and 5 year old loved it.  They usually don't like anything.  
I think that next time I make this soup I will add more potatos. It was really good.

I was disappointed in the consistency of this soup.  It is touted as "hearty," but turns out very thin.  Also, thankfully, I didn't add all of the thyme and I'm glad I didn't.  3/4 of a teaspoon was almost too much.  Also, it required 3 teaspoons of salt instead of one.

My family is from Rhineland Pfalz and this is very much like Oma made. The only thing we do different is more potatoes, carrots and we add one clove of crushed fresh garlic, then stir in a splash of red wine vinegar right at the end of cooking. Prost!

Fantastic as is.  The only thing is that it probably does not need to cook for 3 hours.  The lentils somewhat disintegrated and made the whole thing a weird dirty green color.

Liked this a lot.  Great for a cold day.   I added extra veggies and used cornstarch at the end instead of the flour.

I made this soup as is and honestly I think it needs more lentils. I think that although is smelled good, it was somewhat bland, so I added salt. Also it was very watery.  I may try it a second time with a few of the suggestions to see if it hits the spot and does taste like the Rhinelander's lentil soup... I even doubted and almost opted for substituting a portion of the water with chicken or beef broth....I may go with this next time if I make this soup again to make up for the bland taste.
EDIT: I made this soup again and really replace the water for beef or chicken broth. I added 2 cups of water and it came out much better than the first time. Now, the broth may make it a bit  bit salty so until THEN I would recommend to add more water. The soup was more flavorful using broth than losts of water. Now with the aforementioned adjustments, it does tastes closer to Gustav's soup.

To make it vegan / vegetarian, I used 1 smoked tofu block and added 2 tbs of oil extra. Double the carrots and the potatoes. I also used vegetarian beef broth cubes. Yummy winter stew!

the instructions aren't good like you can't crisp bacon with onions and carrots together and I never put flour in soup. If I were to make this soup again I would use Canadian bacon not the regular bacon that makes more sense

This was delicious! Although I made some tweaks as well...used half beef broth half water (with a beef bullion cube) for my liquid. Added garlic (how does one cook with out garlic??!!) and a can of diced tomatoes. I also sprinkled in some red pepper flakes with my veggies while they cooked down in the bacon. Didn't have nutmeg, didn't miss it. I let my soup reduce/simmer for almost 4 hours, if I did that again I would add the potatoes later as they were a bit mushy. I don't really measure when I cook, just used this recipe as a general guideline and it turned out wonderful and full of flavor!

My picky 6 year old loved this soup. It was very easy too. I cut the amount of flour by more than half and used just a teaspoon of salt. Inexpensive and easy ... my kind of recipe.
