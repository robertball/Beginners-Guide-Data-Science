As this cake is printed I have to lower  my usual rating.   We love the citrus flavors but definitely not with the whole wheat flour.   The flavors seem to age (after a day or so) much more effectively with all white flour.

Followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great. Will make again the next time we want a carrot cake.

This is a wonderful cake!  My 1 1/2 year old son enjoyed it as a snack.  I plan to use this one as a wedding cake this summer.

I omitted nuts. Used vanilla paste to get those wonderful vanilla specks in the cream cheese frosting. Topped each cupcake with a few shredded carrots that were simmered in sugar syrup. Used green food coloring on some frosting - made them for St. Paddy's Day. Erin Go Braugh!

Maybe with a day or two, the spices mull and the flavor is better. But I really didn't have very good luck with this one--the carrots and citrus didn;t have an even balance.

The taste of this cake is absolutely delicious! I have regular carrot cake, but the mix of citrus gives this cake extra zest. The only thing I found was that it was a bit dry the second day. I will cutdown the flour from 3 cups to 2 and substitute oil for the butter next time. All in all I will definitely make this again!

It is great the next day. My husband loved it.  We love citrus flavor in our foods.

Found this cake a little dry! Not the really moist carrot cake I was looking for. Flavour was quite good.
