We love these! I too added a teaspoon of vanilla. I use less sugar since the bananas were very ripe. Didn't have the flax or wheat germ so I opted to use an equal amount of the oats (totaling 1 cup of oats). Due to allergies I had to omit the walnuts. Our new favourite :)

These are really good!  I added a teaspoon of vanilla (couldn't help myself!), the chocolate chips I used were just regular sized, and the oil I used was lemon olive oil.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  These baked for exactly 25 minutes, and I got 16 muffins.  I'd imagine that rather than the mayonnaise that you could use yogurt or sour cream, and next time I'll try white whole wheat flour.  These are ingredients I always have on hand, so whenever I have ripe bananas, I now have several healthy muffins to choose from.  Thank you so much, Happy Mama.

This was a great recipe! I made it a bit healthier by using fat free yogurt for the mayo, whole wheat flour, only 1/2 cup of sugar and applesauce in place of the oil. I also added vanilla. Turned out wonderful and moist. My husband and daughter devoured them!

Probably the best muffins I have ever made!  I added some brewer’s yeast to make it ever more healthy, esp since I didn’t have enough wheat germ

Amazing muffin receipt. Love the addition of both oatmeal and flaxseed meal.  Substituted wheat bran as well and turned out perfect as this adds healthy fibre.  Would recommend chopping up unsweetened bakers chocolate squares rather than using chocolate chips as the uneven chucks add character and uniqueness to each muffin.

These are my new favorite banana muffins! I opted for a full cup of oats instead of the wheat germ and ground flax. I added some vanilla extract and I had peanut butter chips in the pantry so I used about 1/4 cups of those as well! Absolutely delicious!

Yummy and healthy, but a bit too salty. Would've been better with just 1/2 tsp of salt.

I might have bypassed this recipe due to its somewhat unique ingredients, but with everything I needed on hand, I tried it in deference to my nutritionist daughter who is always encouraging healthier food consumption.  Prepared almost exactly to specifications (used fewer nuts and cut them quite fine to make consumption easier for my grandson), this is proof positive that chocolate chip muffins can be both delicious and nutritious, and they won praise from everyone who sampled them - senior citizen, toddler, and even the nutritionist daughter.  Moist, not overly sweet, and packing a bit of crunch,  these are sturdy enough to travel well in a lunchbox, backpack or briefcase for a tasty and healthy snack.  The recipe makes 12 standard sized muffins and freezes well.
