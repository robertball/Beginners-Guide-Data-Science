SO GOOD!  Made this for dinner last night and absolutely loved it!  Only thing I did differently was to add 2 tsp. sugar (the tomatoes I used were a little acidic), and I added 2 cloves of garlic, and finally garnished with a sprinkle of feta cheese.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe as close as I could, using organic tomato sauce, organic diced tomatoes and because I was out of beef bouillon, I used a can of Campbell's double strength beef broth and didn't add any extra water. After taste testing the soup, I did add 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. basil, 1 tbsp. brown sugar, a little worchestershire sauce and a couple good shakes Frank's hot sauce. That's all personal taste but as a base, this is a cost-effective, hearty soup that made a great dinner paired with cuban midnight sandwiches. Thanks!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  This was so yummy and will be made often in my house.  I don't like bouillon cubes, personally, so I used beef broth instead of cubes and water.  I also think I would've liked the bacon crispier than what I had, but I think that was completely operator error.  Very good soup - thank you for sharing it.

delish! The only change I made was to add black pepper and italian seasoning because the broth was a bit bland without it. I will definitely be making this again.

Realy enjoyed this soup - will be a great winter meal.  Used up the leftover ham on bone from Xmas, and all the surplus tomatoes from the summer crop, and did a double batch to freeze away for the winter.

I wanted to like this. I definitely love the idea of it. It had WAY too much beef stock. It didn't even taste like tomato soup. I am going to give tomato soup another try (I'll even add the bacon and elbow macaroni). This just wasn't for me.

Big hit for a grilled cheese & soup supper! I left out the pasta because I did not want a filling soup, but could easily add it to the plentiful leftovers. I was able to use sauce that I had frozen from homegrown tomatoes which gave this soup a very fresh taste. Looking forward to lunch tomorrow!

This was great and took about 20 minutes to assemble.  I did everything as written except I used a bag of bacon bits instead of regular bacon.  It's much easier that way.
