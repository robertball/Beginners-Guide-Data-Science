PORTION IS OFF!!  I rated this recipe 5 stars because it is DELICIOUS! However the 12 servings that this recipe says it yields is WAY off!   After following this recipe to the letter I barely had enough for 4 reasonably sized adult portions.  I can't stress enough how DELICIOUS this recipe was, soooo good!

This stew is FABULOUS!  However, the last reviewer is right...the portions are WAY off.  I can feed four adults well and have one small serving left over for lunch the next day.  I couldn't find celeriac, so used just celery instead and added parsnips - just because my family loves them.  I have made this three times now and have used various kinds of beer (whatever I have on had - ALWAYS at least one can or bottle of something dark).  It has been great every time.  Thanks for sharing!!

absolutely delicious. I couldn't get celery root at the store I was shopping at so I used parsnips and regular celery but everything else I followed to the letter. Just amazing! We fed a family of 5 and still have enough left over for another dinner tonight so I would say the portioning is pretty close.

FAB recipe, what a hit and what flavours, I made mine with ale, dark beer, I doubled the recipe as I had 8 people to feed including 4 hungry big eater men. Also I added mine to the crockpot to slow cook for the day after the initial browning and boiling. The smell is amazing, never thought I would rave so much about the beer in the stew but its incredible with such a distinctive taste. You could really experiment with any strong flavorsome beer. Bought some crusty french stick bread to serve with it and added a handful of chopped corriander before serving. What a hit! boys loved it!

Great basic recipe! Made the best beef stew I've ever had. I halved the recipe and added my own twists.  Used 1 1/2 sweet onion, cut in chunks; half a bag of baby carrots; no celery root or turnip;  one bottle of Guinness beer, added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, about 1/2 cup of quick cooking barley (added the last 1/2 hour of cooking) and used some Montreal Seasonings.  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dry and added it when browning the veggies and then a bit more to the stew itself. Did use fresh rosemary at the end. I think the key is to season each layer and gradually build up the taste. Thank you so much for posting this!

I read the ingredients and read the reviews and I was excited about this recipe and ready to go.  What I DIDN'T read was all the instructions.  I've been pretty much a flour the meat, brown, throw in the rest of the ingredients and walk away for a few hours, crockpot-like.  This one is more labor-intensive than that and I was getting kind of bummed because I really had other things to do that day than fuss with dinner.  I'm so glad I hung in there though!  This was just the absolute best!!!  I won't say that I wouldn't try to cut or combine a few of the steps to see if it makes any difference, but I'll tell you what...if it DOES, I will go right back to this one and stop whining!  This is a just FANTASTIC stew...the flavors just meld so wonderfully.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I'm craving it as I write just thinking about it.  SO tasty!!!

Wow, this recipe is just amazing!  I had never attempted beef stew myself and though this was involved the results were fantastic.  I discovered the secret to tender beef is letting it cook for the full duration - I've had stew in the past where the beef is dry and tasteless, and tasting this recipe throughout the process I found that the beef was wonderful after browning but then got tough when first boiled in the beer.  The subsequent cooking allowed it to reabsorb the moisture from the stew and become tender again.  I used Shipyard Brewer's Brown Ale which had a very robust malty flavor and made a gorgeous brown gravy.  Delicious!

This recipe is delicious, but after following the recipe I felt it could be simplified.  Pearl onions are a pain and expensive, I use diced onions and detect no difference.  I used regular mushrooms as a cost saver and again, no discernible difference.  And most effective for me to save time, after browning the meat, I placed it in a pressure cooker with the celery root and turnips and carrots and broth for 10 minutes under pressure.  Then back to the pot with it all and add the beer.  I also used 1 T worcestershire sauce and 1 T double strength tomato paste to add to the glutamates and boost the beef flavor and I used small red potatoes so I didn't have to dice them.

The flavors in this stew are incredible! I had trouble finding celeriac so I just diced up some celery, and I use Lagunitas India Pale Ale. Delicious recipe!

I only loosely followed the quantities, omitted the celeriac and made a few substitutions (regular mushrooms and regular onions instead of portobello and red pearl, "improvised" for malt vinegar, dried herbs instead of fresh) but followed the directions exactly and this turned out great! It was my first time making stew, too. I'm giving it 5 stars for being an easy and forgiving recipe.

YUM!!!  I didn't have fresh herbs and the only turnip I had had seen better days so I used dried herbs (put in about 1/2 hour before it was finished) and an extra carrot.  This led to my undoing because when it was finished I thought it was missing something (totally forgot about the vinegar because I had already added the herbs) so I added onion powder, garlic powder, and a little red wine.  Probably not at all necessary with the vinegar!  Anyway, I only had a pound of meat so I cut the recipe in half and had to pray that the portion sizes weren't that far off for my family of four.  I think it would have been the perfect amount for most nights but it was so ridiculously delicious that no one could stop eating it.  We ended up pulling out some cheddar biscuits that my MIL had made for us and frozen to sop all the liquid.  Again, YUMMMM!!!!!!!

This was delicious!  I've been looking around for a beef stew recipe with beer that wasn't bland and this definitely fit the bill.

Aroma while cooking is absolutely enticing.  Deliciousness followed the aroma.  As others have said, not exactly up to twelve servings.  I tend to like my stew less soupy so used a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  One question, what is on top of this stew in the picture? This is not addressed in the recipe.

We're quite sorry to be the only dissenting opionion on this to date, but we thought the recipe far too time consuming, and for modest results.

This stew was delicious! I didn't have any vinegar so I left that out and it was great. I also added parsnips. My husband loved it.

Super yummy! I added a little extra broth when it first thickened down, but turns out it didn't need it, it would have been just perfect as written.  Really savory and flavorful though, this was a win!

Very time consuming but totally worth it. My son begs me for this several times each year so I plan a Netflix date and cook away. Fantastic recipe and so excited to have found it again!

This is one of our favorite stews. Wonderful flavor to it. It's often hard to find a brown lager but I've used anything from  chocolate stouts to porters and they all seem to work.

The broth can be on the thin side. I often thicken it a little (not a lot) with corn starch but sometimes there is enough thickening from the flour that this is not necessary. (When using the corn starch, dissolve first in a little of the broth and then add back into the stew to avoid clumps)
