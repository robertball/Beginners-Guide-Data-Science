I'm not one of those people that has to say what they added or substituted. I made it almost accordingly and loved it. The bacon adds a smoky flavor to it, definitely different, but very good.

I skipped the cheese and probably was a mistake. I don't like corn tortillas so next time I will use flour did like the flavor of chicken because can't go wrong with bacon, ranch, enchiladas sauce

Yummy filling. Family likes flour and corn tortilla. Not hard to make but I found that the corn tortillas don't hold together. I'll make and use the filling for casual enchilada lunch but the whole casserole is better when someone else makes it for me :)

These were REALLY dry. I wish I had known, I would have doubled or tripled the sour cream/ranch dressing mixture. These have the potential to be amazing if the right amount of sauce was mixed in.

Tortillas should be softened so they don't break. I heat them in the oven in foil on warm or you can heat them in the microwave wrapped in damp paper towels

I made this last night for my family and didn’t change anything about the recipe except for doubling the ingredients. It’s was so delicious the kids had the leftovers today for lunch. It was hard not eating the filling while I was making it. Now that I’ve made it once, the assembly will be a breeze and we’ll be having it for a weeknight dinner!

I used whole-fat plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream (I didn't have any SC), and this tasted great!  I only had burrito-sized tortillas and ran out of filling before filling up a 9x13 pan.   Next time I may make 50% more filling (or double for leftovers)

Delicious! Obviously not traditional enchiladas, but super tasty. Hubby loved them, actually ate leftovers which rarely happens! Will definitely make again.

Loved this!  Used more chicken, sour cream,  ranch dressing and cheese than listed in the recipe.  Also, dipped tortillas in enchilada sauce to soften them prior to filling.

I followed the recipe the first time and didn't think the enchilada sauce went with the chicken filling very well so, with the leftovers, I took out the filling and made quesadillas out of them.  PERFECT and DELICIOUS!!!

The only change I made was to make these gluten free and eliminate any “heat” as my stomach is easily upset. Even with my changes, (instead of an onion I used one shallot) it was delicious. Will definitely make again.

So quick, easy & delicious! Huge hit w/the hubby & myself. I had  some extra filling left & it was delicious by itself. Once you add the enchilada sauce & cheese it gives it the perfect kick. Will

Amaaazing! I did make a few changes that I will stick with;  I flavored the chicken with taco seasoning and let it refrigerate a couple hours, used applewood smoked bacon, Mexican cheese blend and flour tortillas. Craving it again already!

The tortillas disintegrated as I filled them.  Taste is great.  Next time I make it I will add jalapeños and use hot enchilada sauce.

We enjoyed this recipe but thought it was quite salty.  I didn't add any salt but think the dry ranch dressing was loaded with it.  I think I will use ranch dressing next time without sour cream and dry dressing.

They seemed a little bit dry, so towards the end of cooking time, I actually put some more of the sauce on them.  It definitely helped.

Next time I'll add a little more sause to the top. I used a sharp cheddar and mild cheddar cheese inside and out. Has a great taste that was definitely different from real Mexican. Will make it again.

Made it for out of town relatives-was a big hit. Didn’t have green onions, so used chives from the garden.  Also added roasted poblano peppers,  and used home made enchilada sauce.

Loved this dish. It takes a bit of preparation though. I used chicken beast and diced the meat. I added red, yellow and green peepers to onion sauté and used a bit of the bacon grease to sauté these. I laid enchilada on a bed of spinach and topped with salsa, black olives and ribboned ranch dressing on top. Delicious!!

This was a big hit.  I had 6 people over and made enough for eight.  There was hardly any left.  I used a lot more Enchilada souse that recommend.  I think every thing would have dried out if I did not.  
This is a great dish to prepare in advance and just pop in the oven shortly before serving.  
I will do this one again.
