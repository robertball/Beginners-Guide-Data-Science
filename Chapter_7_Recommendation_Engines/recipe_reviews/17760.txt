I hate to be one of those harsh reviewers who sound really mean, but...This was entirely too sweet for me. None of my family liked it. It was a bad use of 3 expensive steaks. I definitely will not be making this again. The brown sugar overpowered all of the other flavors. It just was not good at all.

A tad too sweet for me.  We like some other marinades better, but this was good.

I've used the recipe several times.  My picky girlfriend who's not a steak lover enjoyed the steaks.  She will only eat well done, so after I used the high heat to sear the meat, I moved the steaks to a medium heat to allow it to get a little more tender.  Takes longer, but doesn't dry it out as much.

Oh, I just made this for a Valentine dinner for me and my hubby...it was great!  I only marinated it for about 30 minutes and it was still delicious.  I did add a squirt of spicy brown mustard (out of Dijon) and it tasted delicious.  Thanks Della for a sure-fire perfect steak.

Try substituting the brown sugar with balsamic vinegar which gives a sweet effect and a glazing that the brown sugar would have had. I also use rosemary and rubbed sage

Wow! My family just loved this!  It was really fantastic.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and the steaks were succulent, super flavorful and tender!  Yummy!

Thanks for sharing this recipe! We enjoyed it very much and will make it often

This was absolutely delicious!  I was very surprised at how wonderful it turned out.  I was worried that it would come out as too sweet, but it was perfect!  I was looking for a different way to marinate my steaks because I was getting bored with the usual.  I am so glad I came across this one!  The ONLY things I did were halved the recipe for two rib-eye steaks and used Tony Cachere's seasoning instead of salt for just a little extra flavor.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This marinade was quick and easy-to-make. It's sweet AND savory. The steak was so tender and juicy, I didn't need steak sauce. I'll make it again!

My husband really liked this marinade, but I wasn't too wild about it. I guess I don't care for the taste of Worcestershire sauce as that is all the flavor that this left on the steaks.

The best use of Worcestershire sauce I have ever come across! Great for BBQ. Had best results when I let it marinate for 24 hours.

This was my first time making a homemade marinade.... it was not difficult at all! My husband & I LOVED it! I used spicy brown mustard and it added a little bit of heat which was nice but not over powering. We were very pleased with this recipe! :0)

I tend to agree with those that found this just a tad too sweet. I'm thinking a little hot sauce (Sriracha?)

I didn't make a change to the recipe itself.  But instead of grilling I pan fried.  Used butter of course.  With the butter & not adding any marinade this was absolutely delicious.  This is a keeper in this household.

This was so tender and flavorful. The best steak I've ever had hands down. We decreased the brown sugar a bit after reading the reviews and I think that was a wise choice. We will be making these again I'm sure. Even the kids loved this one.

It was okay. I would almost prefer a plain old steak with just salt and pepper then this though. The Worcestershire sauce was all I could taste.

Delicious! I think next time i will keep some of the marinade before i add the meat for basting since i cooked it with a frying pan. It wasn't greasy since i browned the steaks on high first and then let the meat cook with the marinade. Yummy!

The steaks came out great.  My husband cooked it on the barbecue grill medium rare.  I had a family gathering at my house and every single piece of steak was devoured in minutes.  Delicious!

I thought I would try this recipe because I just wasn't in the mood to drag out all the 'stuff' I usually put in my marinade.  This is pretty good but just doesn't compare to our favorite, however, I was not disappointed with the taste compared to less effort to prepare!

This recipe was amazing.  I'm kinda new to barbequing, and this was my first time with steak.  It was really easy to put together, and it tasted amazing.  And I don't like cow very much.  If you are looking for a good recipe for steak, this is it.

Not bad. I did have a problem with flare ups. I did go ahead and add a little Dijon mustard and a sprinkling of hot sauce.

This was bomb!! I adjusted the servings to 2 and only put in 2table spoons of brown sugar and left out the extra 2 tsps. I also marinated it for 1 and a half! Cooked at medium rare... DELICIOUS THANK YOU

FANTASTIC! I have been grilling steaks for decades, many different marinades or none at all. Great compliments from guests previously, but these are the BEST ribeyes I have ever cooked or tasted outside of a 5 star restaurant!!!

i loved this marinade, i reduced the brown sugar to about 1/4 a cup instead of a 3rd, and added about half a tablespoon of sriracha to add some heat. the sweetness to heat really did me in. pairing this with scalloped potatoes and sauteed veggies was a great meal.

This is one of the worst marinades I have used for meat. The Worcester is overpowering  and the steak inedible when cooked.  I had and extra piece of meat and did not want to waste it. I Threw away the marinade and soaked the meat in water.

I actually will make it again... I didn't have all of the Worcestershire sauce required so I used beef broth to actually balance it out.... but it still came out tender and delicious. Also my fiancé could actually eat it. He takes his dentures out so that he can actually eat steak and normally when he does that he cant eat... but he could with these and he had a whole pound steak gone in like 5 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe.

Used dehydrated onions, halved the recipe because I had two steaks, pan fried them. Even with the changes, it was still fantastic! I will definitely remember this marinade for future rib steak dinners.

This was awesome, the brown sugar adds a nice char. I only added a teaspoon of Trader Joes Garlic Aioli Mustard to each bag and it really deepened the flavor. Will use this as a go to marinade from now on

I'll give this 4 stars. I tend to like things a little bit spicier but since we made these for X-mas dinner they definitely appealed to all. Young & old. VERY tender and nice flavor.

This was good, and a bit different than we are used to. We didn't have a problem with flare ups like others mentioned, but kind of thought that these were just a touch bland. Thanks for the post.

Great flavor. Definitely liked the addition of Dijon.
