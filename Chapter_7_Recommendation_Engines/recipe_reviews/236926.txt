The texture of this was fantastic. My husband said it reminded him of frosting and he wouldn t be opposed to having it on cupcakes. I felt it was a bit too sweet. I think next time I might try using unsweetened chocolate and adding the same amount of sugar. I used a combo of 60 64 and 70% chocolate (odds and ends from the freezer) and used a hand mixer (because I hate washing the food processor) and it was fine. Probably could have been even better in that or the blender but was still pretty great. I used a scale to measure and another possibility to make it less sweet could have been more tofu. My package was 16 ounces and it called for 12 so maybe if I had used it all it would have been a little more mellow. Overall pretty enjoyable and I would make it again.

This was super easy to make using a hand blender. Most desserts are too sweet so I made this one with 72% chocolate plus two teaspoons sugar. It was delicious but a bit dense. Perhaps less chocolate would lighten it up. The presentation included a thin top layer of creme fraiche raspberries and sliced almonds. Delicious.
