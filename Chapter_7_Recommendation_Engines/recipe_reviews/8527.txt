We really liked the flavor of this dish. After mixing up the sauce, I couldn't understand why this shouldn't be cooked with the chicken and that is what I did. Just poured on top and then added the sliced grapes before the end of cooking. I am kind of surprised that no on has suggested using a combination of green and red grapes to make the dish more visually pleasing. I did this with good results. Served with brown rice.

I will admit I was *very* skeptical about the Dijon mustard sauce, as I am not generally a fan of mustard.  But this was a most excellent recipe!!!  I quartered the grapes (thought the whole grapes wouldn't integrate well at eating time, and I'm glad I did it this way), but other than that, strictly followed the recipe.  I don't really understand the comments by those that were disappointed with this recipe, but I guess to each his or her own.  I made if for a friend that is on a fat-restricted diet due to MS, and it was a bit hit.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I have added it to my "repertoire" and will be making this again.

If you don't want to use the oven (too hot during the summer where I live for that!), here's a stove-top version:  Use the sauce as a marinade (including minced garlic - I used four cloves) for four chicken breasts cut into large pieces (I also added a little oil).  After marinating for a couple hours, heat a little oil in a pan, and saute chicken and sauce for 25-30 minutes.  Add grapes (which I also halved) ten minutes before serving.  Serve with rice. I also used balsamic vinegar, and I omitted the seseame seeds for this version.

Had the girls over for a luncheon and I try to find new, interesting recipes. This one fit the bill, they all loved it and asked for the recipe.
When combining sauce ingredients, do it over low heat and whisk to blend. I especially liked the flavor of the toasted sesame seeds and the grapes added an extra dimension, except when you reheat it - don't like hot grapes!!

I'm sorry.  Everyone seems to like this recipe but I hated it.  I thought the sauce was terrible.  I think it was the vinegar I didn't like.  My family liked it though.  I served it with white rice and peas.  I liked the first few bites then I had to really choke the rest down.  After I realized I didn't like the sauce, I tried to add a few more spices (garlic salt, onion powder, oregano, a little of the chicken broth) and a little flour to thicken it up a bit.  It was OK at best to me, but as I said, the rest of the family liked it.  None of us cared for the cooked grapes, however.
Not the worst I've ever had, but I think if I ever make this again I will omit the vinegar.

This recipe turned out great! Following advice from others, I added the sauce 5 minutes before adding the grapes, except I added all of it! It baked in giving a wonderful taste to the chicken. As well, for added texture, I added sliced mushrooms and onions when I flipped the chicken over. My wife and I loved  it!

This recipe is easy, unique, and tasty.  I used 6 chicken breasts and 1 cup of quartered grapes.  Poured a small amount of sauce on the breasts for the last 5 mins of baking and left the rest to taste.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Great twist on Chicken recipes.
The grapes sounded somewhat questionable, but I went ahead with them only slicing them in half.
Surprise!  What a great accompaniment to the nutty chicken.  Most definitely use the sauce.  It adds that special touch and flavor.

We loved it BUT I tweaked a little. Instead of honey I used agave syrup, and I doubled the amount of garlic. I also used rice wine vinegar as it is milder.
I cooked the chicken with about one third of the sauce and added the rest with the grapes 5 minutes before the end. 
I used only skinless, boneless breasts and I found they were done in about 20 minutes at 400.

I was reluctant to try this, but my husband found the recipe and was excited about it, so I gave it a shot.  I used red grapes instead of green because they were on sale and apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because it's what I had on hand.  This is a delicious dish!  Will definitely make again!!

I've tried dozens of recipes on this website, mostly looking for something different, and this one is the title winner so far!  I LOVE the sauce, it's pretty quick, very easy and (did I say this already?) I LOVE THE SAUCE!!  I added a little bit of the sauce 5 minutes before adding the grapes and it soaked in great.  Make SURE to use a good (expensive) White Wine Vinegar, it'll make a big difference.  This recipe is #1 for me and my husband went nuts over...... the SAUCE!

I thought this was delicious. After reading other comments about the sauce, I served the sauce on the side to dip according to each individual's taste. I dipped alot, my boyfriend dipped very little. To each his own.

Would use less grapes & cut them in half. They really don't add to flavors whole.

My very picky husband loved this recipe!  I substitued sunflower seeds for the sesame seeds and diced the grapes.  I also added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the sauce to tone it down a touch and poured it over the chicken for the last five minutes of baking.  Thank you for a wonderful addition to my recipe box!

The sauce was quite tasty.  The addition of grapes was OK - I liked it pretty well but the hubby thought it was strange tasting, thus the 4 instead of 5 stars.

I made it completely as the recipe stated.  Don't add the grapes to it and then cook 5 minutes.  Add the grapes just before serving.  Better yet, keep them as a bunch on the side.  The grapes are nice and cut the sweetness of the sauce, but they don't do well mixed with the sauce, nor do they do well warm.

Thank you Christine!  What a great recipe.  I was a bit skeptical about the combination of chicken and grapes, but it was a flavour sensation.  I've made this dish twice for my husband and I, again for his brother and wife, and am making it again for company tonight.  I love love love the sauce and haven't changed a thing.

This was the first meal I cooked from this site. I thought it was very delicious. I made it with asparagus sautéed in butter and garlic with a splash of lemon. We loved it. I forgot the sesame seeds though, but still very good. I also put the sauce in 10 min. before it was done and doubled the sauce ingredients.  Very good recipe!

Yum! This was really easy, quick and good. I would only use chicken breasts however. I also used garlic infused olive oil instead of salad oil. I loved the sauce and think it added that extra "something" that put this recipe in the 4-star category. Thanks.

This was a good recipe that my husband & I both enjoyed.  I marinated the chicken in the sauce and cooked some of the sauce along with the chicken.  It really added a lot of flavor.  I used the dijon mustard with whole mustard seeds and it turned out great.

My husband and I had this for supper tonite.  We cleaned our plates and our bellies are full.  This was a delicious dish.  We only ate 2 of the chicken breasts, but we still used all of the sauce because I served the chicken on a bed of white rice, and we mixed some of the sauce in with the rice.  The chicken breasts were so tender they practically fell apart on their own when we went to cut them.  I'm taking the chicken breast we didn't use to work for lunch tomorrow to make a sandwich with.  I thought the sauce could use a little more honey to make it sweeter (that's why I gave 4 stars, not 5), but my husband liked it the way it was.  Had a green lettuce salad on the side.  I will definitely make this again!

I thought this dish was delicious.  I did as others suggested and put 1/2 of the grapes and the sauce when I added the sesame seeds.  I also used red grapes instead of green.

This was a very delicious dinner.  Great flavor combinations going on.  I used red wine vinegar, and just added the garlic and oil (I used olive) to the sauce.  I didn't have sesame seeds, so I added a couple teaspoons of peanut butter to it, also. I went ahead and added the sauce to the chicken as it baked.  When I first tasted it, I thought I should have made it with rice, but it turns out the sauce was actually pretty as a gravy on my mashed potatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I found this recipe on my iPod using the "dinner spinner" application, and we decided to try it. Boy am I glad we did. We used balsamic instead of white wine vinegar because that's what we had. It came out great.

Hubbie loved this recipe - said it was one of the best chicken dishes I'd ever made. I don't know if I'd go that far, but it WAS very good. I used thighs & time I'll serve it with a side of rice to soak up the juices.

I made this for my husband and in-laws 2 weeks ago and it came out perfect. I actually took the advice from some people and placed 2/3 of the grapes together with the chicken at the beginning and then the rest 5 min before it's ready. It's juicy and tender and have lots of flavor. Planning to make it again tonight since it's actually very easy to prepare. Something I can do when I get home after work.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added the marinate directly to the chicken and baked it. The chicken was moist and very taste. Will make again!

This was yummy.  I cooked the chicken in the sauce and found this good.  I quartered the grapes.  I did not have any seseme seeds but their absence did not seem to affect this wonderful dish.  Thanks for a lovely recipe that the whole family enjoyed.

This recipe was very easy with good results.  I did use chicken tenderloins 2/person, with less cooking time. And red grapes. I'd make it again. Except for the grapes, it's one recipe which uses ingredients generally found in the home.

This was rather disappointing. It seemed like a lot of work for a not bad recipe.  The garlic was good with the chicken but the grapes were a little odd and didn't look very appealing after they were cooked.  I probably would not go to the trouble of making this again.

This was definately "unusual" as per the description.  If you're looking for a new way to try chicken, go ahead and try this recipe.  I didn't care all that much for it and thought the vinegar was strong.  I would have given 3 stars, but the warmed left-overs on the next day were not very good.  I will not be making this again.

The more you eat it, the better it tastes.  More garlic truly enhances it. Next time I would marinate it in garlic.  Possibly add ham and cheese since this is so close to a Chicken Cordon Blu.

Lovely recipe.  I added the sauce with the sesame seeds and I also thickened the sauce with  a little cornflour just before i added the grapes. Would work with mashed potatoes and veg.

I love this recipe. It's one I often come back to when compay is coming over. I made the recipe a litle easier by just putting everything in all at once, sauce, grapes, sesame, chicken. Just lay it all out in the pan to bake and it comes out beautifully.

This was just okay.  After making the sauce, it seemed too thin.  I added a little cornstarch and heated it to thicken, was a little better.  My husband enjoyed it; however, this was not appealing to my kids (ages 5 to 11).  Had all the ingredients on hand and was easy to make.  Thanks for sharing; however, probably won't make again.

maybe I did it wrong, but covering it while cooking made it quite juicy in the pan and made the grapes take on a weird flavor. But the sauce is good. Don't know if I'll make it again, but if I do, I'll do it with the grapes on the side.

We really enjoyed this.  I was unsure about the combination of grapes and garlic, but it was delicious.  The grapes cut through the sauce and add a perfect amount of sweetness to the dish.  The only changes I made was adding the sauce to the baking pan 5 minutes before the grapes and doubling the garlic (we love the stuff).  Simple and different.

Well, although I didn't particularly enjoy the sauce, my parents really liked it.  The chicken with the grapes and sesame seeds was excellent, though.

We didn't care for this recipe at all.  The sesame chicken and the grapes were good, but the sauce did not appeal to us.

This was a HUGE hit at my house!! It was so easy to make and the sauce was amazing! As a college student, I am always on the lookout for quick, tasty, and easy recipies that I can make at school and this one has definitely topped the charts! I served this with a mushroom risotto and that was a very tasty addition!

Fantastic recipe! Thank you for posting it! I made it for a Mother's Day luncheon, and it was a hit. The sweetness of the grapes really compliment the tangy mustard sauce.  I heated the sauce through before serving, and doubled the portions because my family likes a lot of sauce. I served it with a saffron rice, and it was delicious!

I made this stove top and used yellow mustard because that is all I had but used 2tbsp instead of 3. I also incorporated the sauce while sautéing. I used diced chicken breast and added green beans  to include my veggies and served in a bed of brown rice. Overall I guess I changed quite a bit but this recipe was a great starting point :)

It tasted great but I could see the smell of the mustard being unappealing... thus I only thought it deserved 4 stars

Easy-peasy and quick to make but dull. All the flavor is literally in the sauce, because the garlic isn't even applied to the chicken - it's applied to the baking pan! If you don't like vinegar or mustard (which contains vinegar) you're going to hate this.  
Unless you already know, all you will learn from this recipe is chicken goes really well with grapes and honey mustard sauce.  There's elements to a great meal in this recipe, but not without extra ingredients, time and effort. If you don't bread, brown, marinate, or bake chicken in sauce, you might as well boil it. (yuk)

I was skeptical but I had most of the ingredients, so I was willing to give it a shot.  Wow was this incredible.  I will be making this again and can see it becoming a favorite because it was so simple and tasty.

For the sauce I used a whole grain mustard, rice wine vinegar, an artisan honey and Bragg's liquid aminos.  Initially I wondered why the sauce was not cooked with the chicken, but the cool refreshing taste when drizzled (doused) over the chicken and grapes really nailed it.  In baking, I used coconut oil, but will definitely use sesame seed oil next time.

I served this with basmati rice and a mixed green salad.  Most excellent.

I wasn't able to use the same exact ingredients, but the basic recipe with substitutions worked really well.  

I didn't have dijon mustard, so I subbed Honey Mustard.  I also didn't have green grapes, so I subbed red grapes and both substitutions were delicious.  I played around with the baking temp and started out with the 400 degrees, but at the end I broiled it for ~5 minutes, turned the oven off and added the grapes.  Let it sit for another 5 minutes and it was all ready.

I'm a beginner when it comes to cooking, and this was easy! We thought this was delicious. I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand, and everything worked our just fine: Balsamic Vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, garlic powder instead of minced garlic, and red grapes instead of green. Since the sauce is on the side, I could just leave it off for my son and I only made half the amount of chicken.

Delicious! I reduced it to 4 servings instead of 6. I added a bit more honey and less vinegar, just because I always like things a little sweeter. Went delicious with sautéed asparagus in garlic! Very easy for a newer cook.

I omitted the seeds (allergies) and added the dipping sauce at the end when I added the grapes.  DELICIOUS!  Definite repeat in our home!
