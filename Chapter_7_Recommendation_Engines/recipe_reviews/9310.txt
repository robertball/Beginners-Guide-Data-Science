These were great and I got rave reviews on them. I made them two weeks before my dinner party baked them than froze them reheated them at frozen stage for about 10 min at 400 degrees and they tasted like I just made them. Everyone thought I bought them!

see-i thought these were really good. you have to temper your spices to your liking. personally, not a huge curry fan-so i used a tiny little bit. they are time-consuming, but very tasty i think.

These were AWFUL!  And they were time consuming.  
Maybe, I did something wrong.  I won't make these again.  And I don't recommend anyone else wasting their time.  Sorry!!!

I was really worried after I reading  the reviews but the family loved them. The only thing I changed was the dough needed liquid to be come a dough so I added 5 tablespoons of water and it worked out fine. they also really neede some type of sauce for dipping. next time I am going to change the spices and have  a dipping sauce. they were not that time consuming but  wrapping balls in dough takes the most time especially if you have a lot to make. I just flattened the dough with my hands and then wrapped the sausage in the middle working the dough smoothly around it. I did not freeze them either because I needed them right then and they turned out fine.

I thought these were great, however they did take a lot of time to prepare.  If you have the time, try 'em out!

This was the first recipe from this site I did not like.  Me and my girlfriend like curry, but the dough didn't turn out.

I make this every year for a gathering.  They are gone in a flash.  I love the taste, just a hint of spice.  It's a keeper for a appetizer.

These take a little work, but they're worth it.  I especially like how you can prep these days in advance!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I'm sure that any really good breakfast sausage would work.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and had no left overs!

I made this. It was too much bread and kinda dry. I will try again with less dough.
