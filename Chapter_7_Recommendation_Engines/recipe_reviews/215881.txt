I really do love the idea of chicken tortilla lasagna, but I thought this was one of those recipes that is better without all of the extra ingredients. I also thought there were some ingredients that didn't stay true to the authentic Mexican taste I was looking for. Without the moz cheese, tomato sauce, and basil I would have given this recipe 5 stars. Also I changed the peppers to green peppers, cooked the chicken in olive oil onion and garlic powder, added Monterrey jack cheese, made the salsa chunky so I didn't need as many onions as called for and used flour tortillas instead of corn just because I like the smoothness of flour tortillas.

We Only used one Onion, and instead of the Tomato and Basil Sauce we used the four cheese. The Wife and Kiddo Loved it and want me to make it again. Now if I could only find a low fat version for myself, lol.

Started with uncooked chicken breasts, sliced.  Sauteed them in oil and butter with onions, green pepper, jalapenos for about 20 minutes.  Cut up chicken smaller while cooking with spatula.

I only used Pace Medium Picante salsa, no tomato sauces.

Transfer into casserole, making layers with tortillas and cheese as recipe states.  Bake about 1/2 hour.

Used 1 large onion, 4 cloves of garlic, fresh basil and oregano, didnt have jalepenos, but used an array of hot peppers that I had in the fridge, didnt have fresh salsa, so I made my own using tomatoes and red,orange, and yellow peppers. Added red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.

This was fantastic, my parents LOVED it. I used up the rest of my tortillas using this and my parents suggested and I agreed that the chicken sauce mix can totally be made by itself and made with pasta, potatoes, any kind of side dish. Its delicious.

I too added more chicken didn't cook it in butter, 1 onion, added tomato's and chili's vs jalapeno's. spaghetti sauce with roasted red pepper (Neuman's) no tomato sauce or salsa. I used what shredded Sargento cheese I had in the fridge which consisted of Colby-jack, taco, and pepper jack. Not sure I had 32 oz all together but it was more than plenty amount of cheese. I too used flour tortilla's because that's what I had. Awesome taste, perhaps I could have added mexicorn if I wanted the corn taste in the dish and may try that next time. Family loved it!!

I made this (almost) exactly as stated and it turned out really delicious. The only thing I changed was to replace half of the mozzarella with cheddar since I only had 8 oz of mozzarella.

My only complaint is that some of the ratios seemed off. Next time, I will use more chicken, less sauce, and less cheese.  But the taste was fantastic. I highly recommend using the corn tortillas because they had a great flavor and texture after cooking for an hour.

Made this for the beau and I last night and it was delicious! I made a few modifications though: cooked in olive oil, used 1 medium white onion, added green bell peppers, no basil or oregano, used crushed red pepper and red pepper flakes, Pace medium salsa, 2 cups of Rotel sauce (found near Rotel tomatoes), Colby/Monterrey jack cheese, and flour tortillas. I also only baked for about 40 minutes. Added black olives on top. Scrumptious!

The original recipe gets 3 stars. I thought it was a bit bland. The second time I made it I used a whole medium jalape√±o, 1 medium green pepper, 1 cup frozen corn kernels, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 28 oz tomato sauce (instead of the Classico), a can of diced tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. I may use only 1 1/2 onions next time, because 2 was a lot. I'm not a fan of corn tortillas, but the flour ones I used the second time around turned to mush. Not a good texture to me. I may just try lasagna noodles the next time and just call it a Mexican inspired Chicken Lasagna. I couldn't fit all of that cheese in the pan. I used maybe half of the mozzarella and a cup of the cheddar. Might switch out the mozzarella cheese for Monterey Jack as well.
