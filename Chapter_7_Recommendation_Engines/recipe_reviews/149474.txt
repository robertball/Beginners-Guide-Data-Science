This was a great recipe but I made a few changes to suit our tastes.  First it is very important to soak the milk in bread as suggested.  Also, make sure to grate the onion right into the bowl so you can integrate the juice from the grated onion.  I used a generous amount of parsely instead of the mint.  I skipped dredging in flour and instead used olive oil for health purposes.  These are a hit every time!!!

This was part of our "dippable dinner" night. I used whole wheat bread instead of white. I also let this meatball mixture sit for 20 minutes before forming it into the meatballs. We really liked these--especially the boys, which really surprized me. They ate a lot, they loved dipping it in the tzatziki sauce with the homemade pita chips. HUGE hit. I'll make this again for sure.

The only alterations to the recipe were to use a pound each of the lamb and beef, and to reduce the number of eggs to 2. Yummy stuff!

Cut the number of eggs to one or two for a pound of meat.  For an easier alternate, instead of frying, try baking them in a greased cassarole dish at 350 (without rolling them in flour).

I made this with 3 slices of white bread, and it was pretty sloppy; I added just one large egg to bind the mixture but it was so wet I had to throw in some breadcrumbs (maybe half a cup). We enjoyed them but I would add more salt next time. I served them in pitas with lettuce, tomatoes, onion and a yogurt/Ranch/garlic powder dressing. Not bad at all. Thanks!

These are really good. I'm giving them four stars because I changed several things. I used all ground beef, plus fresh mint and also added some fresh marjarom, since I had it. For the bread I used some herbed black olive bread that I had on hand, and I only used one egg for about a pound of meat. I started soaking the bread in the milk, then threw it in the food processor along with the salt and pepper, herbs, and garlic. This made a little bread 'paste' that I then added to the meat with the egg. I used about a teaspoon of salt for one pound of meat.

We really liked these meatballs.  Based on other reviewers advice I cut the amount of egg in half.  Also, I cut the amount of mint in half. My mint was home dried and strong.  I served the meatballs on pita bread using the yogurt sauce recipe from the "warm greek pita sandwiches with cucumber yogurt sauce" recipe on this site.    We will make this again!  Thanks.

A few changes: 2 pieces of bread; one egg is fine. (Try with one egg first and you'll understand that 4 is not needed, it would be WAY too much.) I added 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs (more flavorful than bread).  I substituted Greek seasoning instead of salt and pepper and a pound of beef, not lamb. My mom made the meatballs smaller than a golf ball so the recipe made 30 for me.  I put them the oven (no flour necessary) at 350 for 25 minutes and was pleased with the results. Cold leftovers are good too! 5 stars from a Greek ;)

Very Tasty! We had a Greek themed dinner party and made these for the appetizer. The  meatball mixture wasn't very firm so before rolling into balls, we doubled the amount of bread crumbs and chilled in the freezer Which helped some.

Great served with a yogert/cucumber sauce on pita bread. I replaced the dried mint with McCormick's Greek Seasoning and it turned out fine. Will make again.

All the reviews I read were right- delicious, but too sloppy as the recipe reads.  Use only 2 eggs and you'll be fine.

Yummy! These were so delicious and everybody ate them  (picky hubby, 5 year old, 15 month old and me!). I used 1 pound of ground beef since our commissary doesn't carry lamb, and only 2 eggs. I also played with the seasonings a bit, used more mint, parsley, oregano and marjoram. I baked them in the oven and served them on pitas with tzatziki sauce, sliced tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese. We will definitely be having these again, thanks for sharing the recipe.

We purchased a lamb at a local fair.  Not knowing what to do with it, I found this recipe.  My family was very impressed and so was I.  I wasn't sure about the mint, but (oh my) it was delicious.  I made a cucumber sauce and we ate it on rolls.  Yummy!

I made these for a friend of mine who's yiayia came over from greece to ellis island. He is helpful at making suggestions to make things taste better. All he said as he was eating them was "these are good!"
He told me yia yia put these meatballs in a bread sack for his bus trip home from phoenix, where she lived, and they were good. So, I would say that these would have yia yia's approval!  Great recipe!!  Try it!

Great recipe and very simple.  I used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 beef (just what I usually have on hand), wheat bread and about 1 1/2 the amount of salt, but used half the eggs.  Excellent!!

I used this to make Gyro's for dinner. I took the advice of the other's reviews and used only 2 eggs, didn't use the flour and baked them at 350 for 45 mins. I also omitted the mint. I made a cucumber sauce (Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce also on this site) and cut the meat balls in half before adding them to the pita bread. Everyone ate and loved them!!! Thank you for this recipe!

Very good - used them in gyros.  For those reviews that said it was too wet - you HAVE TO ROLL THEM IN FLOUR!!  They are very wet, but will form a sloppy ball that needs to be rolled in flour.  They will hold their shape as you fry them.

The store didn't have ground lamb and so I made it with ground beef and it was excellent. I'm making them again for a dinner party tomorrow.

My entire family loved these! I made them with 3 lbs of turkey, and adjusted the bread/egg accordingly, and they were fantastic. The mint flavor was strong, but wonderful. I was suspicious at first because they seemed as though they wouldn't hold together well, but after cooking they were firm and moist (I browned them in a pan first, and then baked them for 30 min at 375F). Thanks for this great recipe!

My favorite meal! Only used one egg, used bread crumbs instead of bread but have made it with the bread, I just find the bread crumbs easier. I also use a pound of lamb and 1/2 pound of beef.

I served this at our dinner club and it was a hit.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and only used 1 egg.  That was great.  I changed the meat combo to a mixture of beef,pork and veal.  Loved it served with crispy pitas and tzatziki sauce.  GREAT!

We liked these. I think the only change I made was, I did't dredge in flour in fry. I just baked them at 350* for about 30 min., and doubled the recipe.

It's a 5 with changes.  I used 2 eggs and although it set with cooking, the mixture was very difficult to form into meatballs, so next time will use 1.  Also added more salt.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks!!

Way too much dried mint. I followed the correct portions. A lot of people used Greek seasoning instead, I should have too! It was also super wet :(

so good! i doubled the bread, milk, garlic, and onions. only put in 2 eggs.... i flattened them coz i was worried they wont be cooked from the inside.. turned out great! used the leftovers in pasta with cream sauce!
i experimented with a few in the oven, but the fried ones were so much better !

Really good but I will give it a 4 star rating as well since I used half the eggs like others recommended and still had to add more bread crumbs.

Great recipe....thank you for posting this. I used 1.5 pounds of lean ground lamb and the same of lean ground beef......used 5 eggs, added some panko as well as the bread. In terms of seasoning, I really felt that they needed some Greek seasoning so I made a mixture (from this site) and added it sparingly . Delicious and this was my first "go" at Keftedes.

They were good, I made the yogurt sauce for them and they were good. I did use just Turkey and baked them for 30 minutes at 375. Very good and healthy...

Used 2 tsp of chopped fresh mint instead of the dried.  Loved the way the strong flavor of the lamb was diluted with the beef.  Wonderful.  Will make again and again.

I thought this was delicious! I made it almost exactly as written. I used ground venison since I had it on hand and it also has a slightly tangy flavor. And I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. The end result wasn't greasy at all (in fact I think there was more grease when I was done than when I started). I served this with a slightly butchered tzatziki sauce since my husband hates cucumber, but it was amazing! I will definitely be adding this dish to my repertoire.

Way too wet. WAY too wet. I had trouble forming the balls by hand -- in fact, I only used 1 egg and stale bread, and it was STILL too soft and runny. I did these in the oven (took 40 minutes for 1.5 inch cookie scoop meatballs at 350 so I would cook them higher temp if I were you). The volume of liquid I had from the onion and whatever else was so wet would probably have gone SO badly for me if I'd tried to drop these in hot oil. Glad I did not. DH liked them a lot, I couldn't even finish one with tzatziki and a pita. Too soft, and too much dried mint for me. I'm sure these are plenty authentic, and like I said my DH (and my 10 month old) liked them a lot -- this just wasn't for me. Thank you for sharing!

We baked the meatballs (350 degrees on an oiled sheet) and used fresh mint.  Also, we didn't have any ground beef, but using all lamb turned out great!

I made this for Christmas dinner, it's good but the mint is a little heavy in my opinion, especially when you're not used to mint in meat dishes.  I froze the leftover meatballs, I will find out later if they thaw well.

I like this recipe.  I come back to it after looking at other recipes online, this is my favorite. However, don't use four eggs. It will make a gloopy mixture.   I'm going to try adding more meat to it.

Oh yeah; making these again.  I took reviewer "Jimmy's" advice and cut the eggs to one per pound of meat.  Since it's summer, to keep the kitchen cool I put them in a grill pan and grilled them over smoldering rosemary stalks. To keep them gluten-free for our family, I  subbed 2 Lundberg's rice cakes for the bread.  : )

I made a few changes, like I added oregano and used garlic powder,  and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain bread soaked in milk and left out the eggs, and cooked them in the oven at 350 until they reached an internal temp of 155 or higher, they turned out AWESOME!

Great but I definitely had to change the recipe based on all the reviews. I doubled all the ingredients but only used 3 eggs total, 4 tsp mint, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp parsley. Also added a little Parmesan to the mixture as well.

4 eggs is a bit too much. I use 3 pieces of bread with 2 eggs and about 1/8 cup of cream instead of milk. I added a tablespoon of Dill weed. 2 tsp of salt instead of 1. Last I used olive oil with butter to fry. I seared the meatballs on high heat. Then I finished off in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. Hope this helps. They came out awesome.

I just made this recipe with all ground beef as I had no lamb. The texture was good, but the flavor was too mild. I used 2 cloves of garlic, one onion, and fresh mint instead of dried. I also only used one egg as I added a bit too much milk to my Italian breadcrumbs(substitution).

These were delish! They were moist & very flavorful. I served them in pitas with tzatziki and a Greek salad of red leaf lettuce, tomatoes, feta, kalamata olives, capers & vinaigrette.
