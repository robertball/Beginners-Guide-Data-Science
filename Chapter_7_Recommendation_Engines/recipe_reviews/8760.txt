Love this salad, I had no leftovers, I used a little more corn and I didn't use the veggies because I was afraid the picky eaters in the house wouldn't eat it, the end result was still awesome, I added one hard boiled egg chopped, a little celery salt, and about 1 tsp of chopped rosemary too, it was even better the next day!

Awesome! Did a few changes, shredded chicken mix with mayonnaise, placed on a bed of lettuce and top with white bread. My colleague went crazy for this sandwich,she raved about it in the office, gave her the recipe and today I made it for her. :-)

This is very easy and delicious.  When I make it, I call it Chicken Pot Pie Salad because it is similar to the inside of a chicken pot pie.  Great way to get veges in the kids!

This was very tasty and easy to make. I ended up cooking a large frozen chicken breast in the crock pot for 3 hrs. on high. I just added 1 cup of water, some sliced onions and I seasoned with salt and pepper. Once it was cooked I put the chicken on a cutting board and I used a rolling pin to "shred" (flatten) the chicken. This shreds the chicken for you! It made prepping super easy.

I was very skeptical when I read this recipe.  But my husband and I loved it. Gave some to my daughter and her boy friend and they wanted to know when I was making some again. I took a whole chicken and cooked it in my crockpot and doubled the recipe. Will make over and over again

I would have never thought about putting mixed veggies and corn in chicken salad, but this was very good. I used frozen veggies (cooked and cooled) because that's what I had in the house. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. Very quick and easy to prepare.

Awesome! Made without the can of mixed veggies and had fresh corn to cut off the cob. It was delicious.
