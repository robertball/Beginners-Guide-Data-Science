A very quick and easy recipe. Delicious, but even using low-sodium soy sauce, a bit salty for my gang.To combat saltiness, after removing chops from marinade, I brought it to a boil then added 1T brown sugar and 1T cornstarch.The result was a subtle sweet sauce to spoon over a moist tender and flavorful chop.This will be a keeper at our house.Thanks Kathy.

i cooked this twice.  first time i used boneless chops and the rest as usual.  came out too salty and too dry.  the 2nd time i used bone-in chops and 1/8 cup water with the soy and a tad more honey and it came out great!  Be sure to use foil if broiling the chops though, it makes even teflon pans unusable afterwards if you dont cover them.

This is a great, easy recipe, and with a few modifications can be even better! Several reviewers have commented on the saltiness of this recipe. To fix that problem, cut the soy sauce back by half, and use an equal amount of pineapple juice. Add in a tablespoon of olive oil to keep the meat moist, and you have a terrific marinade.

Easy and tasty. A bit on the salty side, due to the large soy sauce amount needed.

If you read all my reviews, you will see I love teriyaki pork, chicken, salmon.  This pork chop recipes is so easy, and quite tasty.  I baked mine at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, because winter has set in early here for grilling.  Another recipe for my recipe box!

Wow! These are fantastic! Thanks for the recipe. I used fresh chopped garlic; and I found out too late I had only 1/4 cup of soy sauce. We raved throughout the meal about how excellent this is. I grilled two boneless Hormel tenderloin chops, and they were excellent. I also reserved the marinade and after boiling it (so you wouldn't hear about us on the evening news), I poured it over the grilled chops that I had set on a bed of otherwise nearly tasteless bean sprouts. Rice would have worked, too. The marinade ran over into our grilled zucchini, which was fine with us. Yummm!

Good marinade.  Tastes similar to Hawaiian style teriyaki if you have ever had that.  I actually think it would be better on chicken than pork chops though and I think I am going to try that next time.

Very easy to make.  Needs a bit more taste to make it a great dish though.  Perhaps fresh garlic?

I followed the recipe although I marinated my frozen chops in the sauce all day and also pierced the meat.  I then skillet cooked the meat for about 20 minutes in the marinade and then added corn starch to sauce and poured over our rice.  My family has found a quick easy and delicious meat recipe.  This would also be good on chicken, roast and fish....

Tasty, but a bit too salty for my liking. If I were to cook them again I might use less soy sauce or either marinade for less time (I did them for 2 hours).

I used only 1/4 cup soy sauce to cut the saltiness, but added 2 tbsp Worcestershire  sauce and 1 tsp minced fresh ginger. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to bake at 350 for 35 min, but found that this was not long enough for the internal meat temp. to reach 170 F for pork. So, I raised the temp to 450 and baked an additional 10-15 min.

Okay, so, I took the other reviews into mind, and I tweaked the recipe some....
1) 1/4c soy sauce
2) 3/4c orange juice (I used fresh squeezed)
3) 4 Tbsp brown sugar (Or to taste… I wanted mine sweeter and I had no honey)
4) Kept garlic and vinegar the same (I may have used more garlic, but that’s okay!)
I taste tested and it’s good. I'm off to add some veggies (carrots, sugar snap peas, broccoli, etc.) to the pork. If I had rice, I’d serve it on the side.

The pork chops were good. The flavor didn't go into the meat as much as I'd have liked but they just means next time we will marinate them in the sauce overnight.

This marinade made deliciously juicy chops! I used the advice of another review and used less soy and added pineapple juice. I also added some fresh chopped garlic. I pan fried mine instead of grilling and the sauce carmelized on the outside. Delicious!!

This was a pretty easy and tasty recipe. I made it exactly as written; the chops marinated almost the whole 4 hours before I started to get hungry and cooked them. I cooked them on a countertop grill for 6 minutes per side, and they came out cooked pretty well (only a thin strip of pink in the middle). The chops were nicely grilled on the outside, yet still fairly moist. The flavor was not too strong, though, but nice anyway. I'll probably make this again soon, perhaps with chicken breasts as suggested. One minor quibble, though: I thought there was too much marinade used. But I'm not very familiar with marinating meats; I know some marinade will always be discarded, and I don't know how much is needed to soak into the meat. It just looked to me like I wasted a lot of soy sauce. Still, a great recipe.

This was great!  I did not find it to be salty as the other reviews have suggested.  I only put in 1 tsp. of the garlic powder and just a dash of worchesterhire sauce.  It was fabulous.  I think it would be great with some grilled pineapple.  I think it would be good on steak and chicken too.  I will definitely make it again.

Very easy and good recipe.  I reduced the soy sauce to a 1/4 cup and kept everything else the same.  Turned out great.  Served with Fried Rice by homemaker.  Perfection!!!

I can't really rate this as a five star because I changed the recipe quite a bit. The taste was fantastic and a very nice change from the usual. After reading the rest of the reviews, I substituted teriyaki sauce for the soya sauce. The sauce was not nearly enought to marinate two pork chops so I tripled the amount and added 1/4 cup of water to the mixture (it would have been too strong without). After marinating it for 5 hours, I baked it with a little marinade poured over top and spread each side of the chops with plum sauce. I baked it for 1/2 hour on each side. Turned out perfect and wasn't too salty at all!

I made this with the only change being I cooked it in the oven as suggested by another member. I liked it enough to try and modify it to be better. Wasn't the best but definitely has potential.

I used this on boneless chops and enjoyed the flavor.  I did find the marinade a bit salty so I added 6oz. pineapple juice to dillute the salt a bit.  The flavor was good and this is a super easy marinade to whip up.

Quick and easy.  I agree with other reviewers that it was a little salty, but I just dumped in a tablespoon of brown sugar before it was done and it toned down the saltiness and tasted great.

Very simple to prepare.  My husband LOVES these.  They seem to need a little kick to the flavor in my opinion, but we will be having these again.

I thought this recipes was just OK.  I marinated tha pork chops over night and they still did not have a very strong flavor.  Maybe longer in the marinade or cut the pork into smaller strips to allow for more flavor.

This had good flavor, but was too salty.  I marinated all day while at work and that could have been why.  If made again, would use less soy or low sodium soy.

These were just a tad too salty for me, but the pork chop was very tender.   Will definitely make this one again, with a little less soy sauce. These were fantastic!

Very good, use reduced sodium soya sauce for less salty taste. I always marinate my steaks in this and it is so good.  I will use for chicken as well.

A very tasty marinade.  As others suggested, I only marinated for an hour and a half and that was certainly enough.  I also used lite soy sauce to reduce saltiness.  Since I was making them along with baked scalloped potatoes, I browned them on the stovetop and then baked at 375 for 35 minutes.  Excellent!  I can't wait to grill out next time.

I would make these again. Everyone enjoyed them. I thought they would have more flavor than what they did. I will marinate them longer next time. Made the barbequed cabbage, from this site, to go with them and they paired up nicely.

These pork chops were carmelized perfectly! Such a good flavor, although I let my chops marinate all night for the flavor all the way through.

Very yummy and quick marinade!  I cut this recipe in half, used a fresh clove of minced garlic and actually had run out of honey, so used about 1 1/2 tsps of brown sugar. Marinaded for just over 3 hours and then hubby BBQ'd them, resulting in moist and tasty pork chops!

This is a very good base marinade.  I used minced garlic instead of powder.  As for cooking... I floured my pork and seared it in an oven safe skillet.  Once browned I transferred the skillet to the oven and baked at 350 for 15 minutes till no longer pink.

This was very good.  I only had 1/3 cup of soy sauce and I added water to complete the 1/2 cup of liquid.  I added an extra teaspoon of honey and I minced 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  The whole family enjoyed this and we will make it again.

These chops were okay.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were much too salty from all of the soy sauce.  Even my husband, who never notices when things are salty, thought they were too salty.  The flavor was okay - we ate them, but I won't make these again.  There are much better teriyaki recipes out there.

This is absolutely the best!  I've taught my 7 year old how to mix it up and he calls it his "secret recipe."  Easy.  Serve with rice (yellow or wild), carrots, and sugar snap peas.

This is the best pork chop recipe I have ever found.  My boyfriend and I loved them!  They came out so tender and juicy.  Soy sauce works great with pork.  This recipe will be one I use again and again.

These pork chops are tasty and moist. I allowed these to marinade for 10 hours while I was at work and they came out great.  I also reheated the pork chops for another meal and found them to be as moist and flavorful after I microwaved them for 4 minutes on high with just a few TBSP of water added as they were the first night.

Great! The addition of the red wine vinegar tenderizes the pork. I used fresh garlic instead of the dried and for those of you using regular soy sauce, try tamari instead. It has the same great taste as soy, but not the extreme saltiness and it is much better for you than regular soy sauce. You can usually find it in the health food section of your local grocery store.

Super salty so maybe use a little less soy sauce (I even used "lite") and add fresh garlic.  Otherwise, family gave it a big thumbs up.  Served with bagged Asian salad for a satisfying meal.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

Very simple and easy to make. However, I added a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce and a bit of honey to get a sweeter taste. Plus I grilled the chops for 20 min to get them nice and well-done. Thanks!

I made this with sherry vinegar, lite sodium soy, and minced garlic.  My husband loved the pork chops, but he especially liked the remaining marinade that I boiled on the stove and added as an accompaniment.  He thought it tasted like a good Jack Daniel's sauce. We drizzled it over jasmine rice and veggies.  Next time I will thicken it with a bit of corn starch. My kids also enjoyed the marinade.  Given the fact that I always have these ingredients on hand, I will definitely make these again.  It would be good with another meat as well.

Really Good!!  I doubled the marinated and reserved about a third. Marinated meat for 8hrs, then brought reserved marinade to a boil and added 1/2cup BBQ sauce and 1/2cup peach perserves simmered to thicken.  I used this mixture on the chops the last 5min of grilling. I think the sweatness of the sauce off set the saltiness of the soy sauce because we did not find it too salty. Topped with chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds for garnish.

This is a super easy and tasty marinade.  I followed the recipe exactly and the chops turned out tender and very tasty.  I boiled the leftover marinade and used it to saute fresh vegetables for a great side dish.

Best pork chops I've made.  They marinade is so good.  It is a little saltly because of the soy, but awesome. I am going to try with chicken next.

I did not care for this marinade...my husband liked it but it was too salty for me...I couldn't even finish my pork chop. I won't make this again, there are others on the site that are much better. (I gave it a 2 star rating because my husband thought they were good otherwise would have rated it lower.)

Because of changing numbers of dinner guests, I used both bone-in and boneless pork chops and some were marinated overnight while a couple just had an hour or so in the marinade. They all turned out great, though, which I guess shows how forgiving this recipe can be. I did substitute fresh garlic for the powder and added a touch more honey.  I grilled the chops and served them with steamed broccoli and herb-roasted potatoes. This was a very nice meal.

I used a pre-made Asian Ginger Teriyaki Sauce from Robert Rothschild Farm found at the grocery store.  I served with stir-fried veggies (julienne red, yellow and orange bell peppers, sugar snap peas, fresh green beans and match-stick carrots.  I added about 2 Tbsp. of the sauce to the veggies for a little zip.

Very easy and tasty.  Only about 10 minutes to cook.  Just need to plan ahead to get the meat in the marinade (I soaked for 4 hours).

I used this marinade with boneless pork chops and grilled them outside on the gas grill.  They were delicious, tender, and had a wonderful flavor.  I will be making these again.

These were just okay.  They were VERY simple to make, but really salty and not too much flavor...other than the salt.  I don't think I'll be making these again.
Thanks anyway.

Excellent!!  My family loved this recipe and it truly is so easy to put together.  I did use half regular soy sauce and half low sodium soy sauce just to help cut some of the salt.  We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks.

Yum!  I made this with bone-in pork chops, and they came out nice and tender.  I used low-sodium soy sauce and didn't have any problems with saltiness.

This was ok, but I was totally NOT impressed.  I thought the flavor was really bland.  We used reduced sodium soy sauce and broiled instead of grilled.  I think the flavor would have been enhanced by grilling, but still...not sure I'll try again.

My husband really liked this recipe, but I, like many others, found it a bit on the salty side.  I thought it deserved a 3.  He said it was good, but nothing was really spectacular about it, so he said 4.

These were OK but I think less and lite soy, some olive oil, brown sugar instead of honey, then season to your liking before grilling to give them more flavor.

This was good and so easy to make, but even using low-sodium soy sauce, we all found this to be quite salty.  Perhaps it is because I put more marinade on the chops while they were grilling.  Next time, I won't do that.

I marinated this all day and the pork turned out very tender. It was very tasty. Next time I will probably reserve a little of the sauce to use after it's cooked.

My husband really enjoyed the flavor that the marinade gave to the pork chops.  I used boneless pork chops and marinated them for 8 hours and cooked them for 6 minutes on each side.  My chops came out a little dry.  Either I cooked them too long or someone had suggested that I use pork chops with the bone in.   All in all it was a good recipe.  Thanks

Yum!  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this marinade for the pork chops.  I made this with lots of fresh garlic and some chopped up ginger.  I also added a little more honey as well.  I'll definately make this again because it was so easy.  I had all the ingredients on hand which was very convienient.

The pork chops were very juicy with this marinade and I'm sure I overcooked them as I tend to do so with pork.  However, the flavor didn't pop the way I expected.  I think next time I may add a bit more honey to flavor them more.  I think it will be great on chicken!

I used this recipe for chicken, and my hubby and I loved it!! This is great for a meal in a hurry, it takes no time at all, and the ingredients are those that are normally found in the house. Great recipe!!!

Excellent! Dinner received raving reviews from the entire family. Will try with chicken very soon.  I marinated the chops 4 hours using 'reduced sodium' soy sauce and the results were wonderful!!

This is our favorite way to grill pork chops now- they always turn out moist and full of flavor! Only need to marinate the time stated in recipe for flavor and I use fresh garlic. Even the kids love this one!

This is a great, easy recipe. However we marinated it for 24 hours and found the taste a bit overpowering...next time I will marinade in the morning and then cook that night...and there will be a next time...kids liked it alot.

I put these in to marinate before my husband suggested going out to eat.  So, they marinated for 24 hours in the fridge.  They were increadible!  I will definately use this again.  Maybe on chicken next time just for fun.

These were OK, but even with low sodium soy sauce they were very salty. I used the George Foreman grill, and the chops did turn out very juicy. Probably won't make them again, though.

We used this marinade for boneless chicken.  I felt the soy sauce was a little overpowering.  I thought the other ingredients would affect the taste of the chicken more than they did.

We tried this last night with pork chops on the grill and it was excellent! I only marinated the pork for 1 1/2 hours so it was not too salty.  The pork was tender and juicy and the marinade was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

I may have let it marinate too long, as the taste was pretty salty.

Delicious! Takes the hum-drum out of ordinary pork chops. Extremely tender. We really loved this recipe. I would definitely serve this to guests.
