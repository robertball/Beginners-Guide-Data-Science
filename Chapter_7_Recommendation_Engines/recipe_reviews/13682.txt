please dont make this...there are much better pumpkin bread recipes on this site...but if you do not heed my warning and decide to make it...please at least add a teaspoon or so each of cinnamon, ginger, or nutmeg, and possibly cloves and vanilla. w/o these this bread will be very bland.

I made this for Ibby's Pumpkin Mushroom Stuffing and it was perfect for that.  However if I was just having it for a pumpkin bread I've had better.  I added extra cinnamon and it still lacked flavor. But for the stuffing it was wonderful.

It was a little dry, even with custard spooned on top.  However, I think it would be wonderful in a dressing/stuffing.

greatly enjoyed by all the family and friends. I think I have started a new tradition in our family this year. I was even able to use splenda so my diabetic husband could enjoy some of it.

This was the best pumpkin bread recipe I have ever baked!! I baked up two loaves to have as dessert for our annual Oktoberfest. It went so fast and so many asked for the recipe, that I made 4 batches, 8 loaves, to give away at Christmas! A big hit! And the real beauty, I didn't change a thing!

I really do love this bread.... All you have to do is add spices as you like... I made it and it was really good. It was a healthy dessert and snack choice.

For me, it turned out fairly dry, and too much nutmeg. Next time I would stick to just cinnamon.

I made this, but changed it up quite a bit by adding 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup dark chocolate chips, and 1 cup walnuts. It was very tasty (maybe due to the additions?), but was definitely a bit too dry. If I try it again I would half the recipe, but keep the full 2 cups of pumpkin.

I made this for a class project. After reading some reviews, I added a small amount of cinnamon to the recipe. Also, the middle didn't cook all the way so it ended up mushy while the sides were cooked perfectly fine. Everyone in my class loved it though. Overall, it was still a pretty good recipe.
