These are very good. Per previous review I will also make another recipe of sauce. I did use shredded beef instead of ground beef. Will make these again.

Made as written except for the chili sauce. Garlic, chili powder, and water doesn't sound like much of a sauce to me. I used another recipe from this site. So, my review is for the tamales themselves. These turned out really good. The only real problem I had was getting the tamales to hold together during the steaming process. Could be a user error but I will tie them up with cooking twine next time. My dough might have been too wet too? I'm not sure but these tasted fantastic! I will definitely make these again!

Needs help here and there, but over all, a fine basic idea.
Also, garlic + chilli powder + water = not good sauce. At least use blank tomato sauce instead of water...

The amount of fluid list was even close to what it needed, then the dough sticks to the wax paper.
