When AR edited my recipe they left out a few things which I thought should have been included. One is, when you pour the dressing over the fruit, I had the fruit in a large colander so the excess dressing would drain off and when serving the salad, I said to serve in individual servings and top with toasted pecans or you can leave it in a large dish and allow guests to serve themselves. But, just before serving sprinkle the top with the toasted pecans either way.

We really liked this! I did substitute raspberries and blackberries for the kiwi(not a huge fan).  The pecans really add to the salad.

Question: Can I make this ahead of time and keep in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours?

I used the fruit that I had on hand, and the dressing was really good-I liked the idea of serving in lettuce cups also.
