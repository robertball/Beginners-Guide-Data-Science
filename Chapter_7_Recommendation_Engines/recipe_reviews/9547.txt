These are the best brownies you'll ever eat. However, if you use wrapped caramels instead of caramel sauce, it is easier to melt them in a bowl in a microwave for the sake of cleanup. Just stir every few minutes until smooth.

I love this receipe, but I use caramel topping instead of the individual caramels.  I spread it on the brownie part after it comes out of the oven.Then I sprinkle the chocolate chips over the topping.  Continue with the rest of the instructions.

These was AWESOME!!  Rich, oooey and gooey!  The only change I made to this recipe was to substitute ground walnuts in place of chopped pecans (for the kids).  In my opinion,  this recipe was more time consuming than many brownie recipes.  Make sure to cool bars completely, cut into small pieces and have LOTS of milk nearby!!  The only thing I will do differently next time is to melt the caramel in a glass bowl over pan with boiling water (double broiler effect). The caramel made a mess out of my pot.  I had to put water in the pot and heat to get all the caramel out.  However, the preparation and clean up was WORTH every bite!

I made this recipe with brownie mix instead of the cake mix and just made the brownies as the package indicates. Then I made the caramel brownie recipe as it instructs. It turned moist and ooy gooey yummy!

These were wicked gooey and yummy!! I heard the horrors of caramel cleanup so I used the sundae carmel sauce instead of wrapped caramels; in place of nuts I used heath bar pieces from the baking aisle; and Devils Food Cake in place of the recommended one (store didn't carry it). Only thing I would change is use a smaller pan-not the 9x13 because they were very thin and i like my brownies thicker. My students loved them!!

These are always wonderful.  Devil's Food cake mix can be subbed in for the German chocolate and I usually add another cup of chocolate chips to make these extra rich and gooey.

This is one of our favorite recipes but as others have noted, it is quite gooey and can be difficult to clean up after. I found that if you line your pan with parchment paper, it helps immensely. After your brownies are baked, lift up the parchment paper and use a pizza cutter to cut your brownies on a cutting board. Much easier all around!

The recipe for Caramel Brownies is so easy. I first made it for a bake sale at school. Everyone wanted the recipe. I made for another school for a teacher appreciation day and it didn't make to the teachers the office staff kept it for themselves. It is so delicious.

These brownies were gooey and perfect.  I substituted milk duds for the caramel and chocolate chips and it made for less prep time and easy clean up.

I made this exactly as stated although I had a block of carmel so I just weighed out the right amount. For those who had a hard time getting these to cook through, make sure the bottom layer is done, maybe an extra minute or two.  When these are completely cooled they cut just fine.

This got RAVE Reviews from friends and neighbors!  Quite a few people said that it was the best they ever had!  One even said I should become a chef!  The batter was a little lumpy so I added a couple tablespoons of water...but this was fantastic!

Literally one of the best brownie recipes ever! I cannot tell you how quickly people devoured these because I don't think that they have a time measurement for that rate of speed yet. I split the nuts in half (half pecans and half walnuts) and I also use Betty Crocker's Triple Fudge mix and 11 ounces of caramel! Deeeelish!

I have made these brownies several times.  I found I like to use about half the caramel.  They are less gooey and easier to cut and eat.  You can save the leftover caramel for caramel apples.  I also like to drizzle a bit of caramel on top just before it cools completely along with some more chocolate chips.  Great recipe!

These were great and easy! for the batter I used only 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter and made up for the moisture with more evap. milk just so it wasnt too dry. Baking times were very accurate for me, and turned out chewy and moist and very good! Need milk to drink with these, for sure!

Wow.  These were amazing.  My husband said they are the best brownies he has tasted ever.  My batter was way too thick to "pour" also, but I spread it out as best I could in the pan.  I probably would use a smaller pan next time.  Took forever to peel all those little caramels, but it was worth it!

Boy are these brownie's fantastic.  It really was a recipe that took a lot of faith because it states to "pour" the batter but batter was very thick.  There was no "pouring" to be done.  I mixed it and patted it into the pan.  I made changes based on what I had on hand: I used caramel chips (only add 2 T. of cond. milk though), Spanish peanuts and dark chocolate that I chopped small.  Great recipe and versatile.  Thank you.

Love it!!!! I've made this one several times now, but I have to say it's the best brownie I've ever tasted! I actually just made this for valentines day yesterday, and added heart sprinkles to the batter and on top to make it more festive. I'd suggest adding choc. chips to the batter as well, but overall, I can't get enough of these! Plain milk could be substituted in place of the evaporated milk, which is what I did when I realized we accidently grabbed condensed milk (oops!). Next time I might also make my own cake mix... :)

Super recipe that is very rich and extremely gooey!  Made this several times, with and without the box mix.  Both versions are good, but I prefer these brownies when they are made from scratch--not the box mix.  Thanks for sharing.

Don't hesitate to make these brownies---yes there are a few more steps, but very worth it.  I added a little cooking time to mine as well and that helped them to firm up.  If you don't want to unwrap the caramels  buy the bag of "caramel chips" in the baking isle.  The whole bag worked out perfect for me!  Just watch out---they will be gone in a flash!

O...M...G...thank you SO much for sharing!  These were super easy and amazing.  I wasn't paying close attention at the grocery store and accidentally grabbed milk choc. chips instead of semi-sweet...they still came out delicious but I think the semi-sweet would be even better!  We will be making these again and again!

These were good, though I probably won't make them again. I tried the 9x13 pan initially, but there wasn't really enough batter to cover the whole pan while still keeping some out for the fifth step, so I switched to a smaller pan like other reviewers suggested. I should've gone with the 9x13. It was really hard to tell when they were done. They were definitely ooey-gooey thick, but they still crumbled to pieces when you tried to hold one. Wasn't bad, but wasn't exceptional.

I was not sure how these were going to work , as the brownie mix was very thick and was not going to pour and had to be spread in the pan, and once spread seemed very thin... I baked the first layer they came out nice and puffy. I used wrapped caramels and evaporated milk mix, I think it was much thicker/stickier than caramel syrup and not a lot of work. The rest was good.   I buttered and floured the pan well so the wouldn't stick as others mentioned and the brownies were wonderful!

Super recipe, husband & family love it! I've also made it with a yellow cake mix for caramel blondies - nice alternative, just as delicious!

I found this recipe after being pressured into making caramel brownies for my colleagues and they were absolutely delicious!  Everyone loved this recipe and constantly wanted more.

I remember something like this when I was young.  I loved it then and love it now!  YUMMY!!  Only change I made was to use carmel topping instead of carmel pieces.  Still tasted great.

This recipe is very easy to make and everyone at work loved it.  I used caramel sauce instead of melting the caramel/evap milk.  The brownies are very rich so cut them in small squares.  Thanks for sharing!!

These are delectable.  Nothing in the recipe needed to be changed or adjusted.  I didn't think them too sweet at all.  When I need a sweet "fix," this is just the thing.  These would be lovely to use in a brownie sundae with just a little scoop of vanilla ice cream or very lightly sweetened whipped cream on top.  Thank you for this marvelously decadent recipe.

These are delicious! I had my doubts at first, because my batter was very thick and the recipe said to "pour" it into the pan; i ended up more spreading it and the consistency was more like dough than batter, at least for me. But, the end result was great!

I love these brownies!  The only things I do differently when I make them are I omit the pecans and use toffee pieces and I use only a 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips.  They are fantastic!

Pretty good!  I used caramel syrup (ice cream topping) instead of melting my own caramels and it turned out fine.  I would make these again.  Also very easy and quick! Good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

These brownies are amazing, very rich but very good! Mine turned out a bit underdone, but I stuck them in the fridge until they hardened up and no one complained! Next time I'll leave them in a little longer. GREAT recipe!

I have been making this exact recipe for 25 years. Always get rave reviews.  I will also note that the bag size on the caramels has gotten smaller, 11oz now. You'll need to buy 2 bags and my old recipe says to use 50 caramels, hope that helps. I use Duncan Hines German Chocolate cake mix. And you'll need to crumble the remaining batter over the top, way to thick to pour. Once cooled, I store mine in the refrigerator, to soft for me to be left out on counter. Also, if you are cutting your brownies in the pan use a plastic knife so you don't scratch your pan.

They have since downsized the bags of caramels from 13 oz. to 11 oz. so I had to buy two bags then weigh out 2 more ounces. Just a heads up for those trying this recipe for the first time. Was yummy in the tummy and my guys absolutely gave it 10 stars!

These are amazing! I started making these waaaay  baaaack in 1970. I make them AS IS! Something different than so many who rate recipes, most of whom make changes, or so it seems.  They are very rich and delicious. I usually cut them into one inch squares, allowing people to eat one, or several, depending on their preferences. And I do use the German chocolate cake mis. Regular chocolate cake mix just isn't as good. I recommend you make them as written and ENJOY!

I've made this recipe several times but I alter it a bit. I have a friend that can't eat pecans so I only press them into half of the pan. I put them on the left side of the pan.  I also only use half the amount of choc chips, putting them on the caramel but only on the top half of the pan. I use a half cup of butterscotch chips, putting them on the caramel but only on the bottom half of the pan.... Its like getting several different batches of brownies out of one pan. Choc chips w/ pecans, choc chips w/o pecans, butterscotch chips w/pecans and butterscotch chips w/o pecans. You can use peanut butter chips too!  My friend appreciates the extra step taken for her and everyone loves them.  YUM!!!

pretty good, make sure to bake these in the right size pan. I baked them in a smaller pan and even after baking them for much longer they were still gooey, but I still got lots of compliments on them!

These brownies are very yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only problem i had was cutting them.  They are very gooey and difficult to cut into neat squares. We topped ours with vanilla ice cream for a very rich and tasty treat.

I made this recipe as written. They are amazing! Only thing I would change is to use a smaller pan. Because you're not adding all the ingredients like for a cake, there just isnt enough dough to fill the 9x13 pan. They're just too thin. Love them, but would like them thinker. I will definitely make again and again!

Great brownies. I've been making them for years off of my mother-in-law's recipe card. Was so glad to find it here when I couldn't find my recipe card. I substituted two cups (an 11 ounce package) of caramel bits for the wrapped caramels. And I discovered that an 11 ounces package of the caramels you have to unwrap has 40 caramels in it,  A little less than some recipes that call for 50, but it works.   Plus, two thirds of the batter that supposed to go in the pan is a little more than one and a half cups, in case you're not in the estimating.  :-)  One last tip to myself, a small can of evaporated milk is enough for the two thirds of that's required for the recipe

I just made these. Didn't have any nuts so didn't use them but i love nuts so would use them if i had them. Also I only had a brownie mix not a cake mix so that's what I used. And lastly I only had milk chocolate chips but OH MY thay are still so good. I didn't understand how you could bake one layer first & then add another layer & bake some more that the bottom layer wouldn't be too done, but it wasn't. Very good & I'm sure it is great just the way it is written. I didn't change the recipe intentionally, just had to go with what I had on hand. Thank You...this is going in my recipe box.

My teen daughter doesn't like caramel.  She ate more of these brownies than her 3 brothers put together!  They are wonderful!
