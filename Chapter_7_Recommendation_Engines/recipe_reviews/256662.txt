I made this with fresh jackfruit that was a bit over-ripe, but this recipe was delicious nonetheless. I had to search a bit to find that one 20 oz can is about 3 cups. That proportion seemed right. I served it over rice with chopped fresh cilantro on top and some plain yogurt on the side to help me with the spiciness. My husband ate it without the yogurt and he liked it a lot too. It's a lovely combination of sweet and spicy.

I used Detroit spice instead of garam Masala.   I was short on jackfruit so I added Winter squash.  I used a crock  pot for little more simmer and cut back on spice

Made it exactly according to recipe the first time; it was easy and delicious, though a bit hot for my gringo palate. I have made it several times since and have discovered that, for convenience, it is possible to replace the tomatoes and tomato paste with 1 28-oz. can of crushed tomatoes, and I sometimes, when in a hurry, use a good brand of ginger-garlic paste in place of fresh peeled minced ginger and garlic. And the spice heat can be adjusted to taste. A winner!

Excellent recipe!  The spice combo for this sauce is outstanding.  I added coconut milk for added richness.  I also subbed fresh basil for the cilantro.  I've also made it with chicken in addition to the jackfruit and it was a great combo of sweet/savory flavors.  This has become my go-to curry recipe!
