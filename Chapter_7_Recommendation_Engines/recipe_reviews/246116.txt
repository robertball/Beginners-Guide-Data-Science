So delicious and refreshing!!! I used homemade tamarind paste  to make this Agua Fresca. It's just like the one I used to drink in Mexico when I was little. My opinion is than the lime and oranges are only for garnish as tamarind is tangy enough to add more acidity. Sugar has to be adjust to personal taste. Loved it!!!

I couldn't find the tamarind concentrate, but I did find the powder mix that already has sugar added, so I used that. I had never had tamarind flavored anything before, and I thought it was good and refreshing.

I added a shot of Bacardi's White Superior and a tablespoon of sugar for a nice summer cocktail.  It was great!

Just the right amount of sweetness!  I garnished with lemon, lime, and orange slices.
