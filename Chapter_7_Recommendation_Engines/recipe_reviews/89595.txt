Amazing Salsa!
I chnged it up just a little.
4 Avocados.
3 Mangos.
1 Large Jalapeno.
1 Red Onion.
3 Squeezed Limes.
1 'bunch' of chopped cilantro.
Salt & Pepper - very little of each
and maybe 1-2 tsps of olive oil.

Served with some seared scallops.
Was excellent.

I used red and green bell peppers and it was excellent! YUM!! I may even venture out and include a little jalapeno or habaneros peppers next time.

I used this for a Salsa Recipe contest and won.  It is pretty good.  I didn't follow the recipe completely because I couldn't find it before I rushed to the store.....so I used green onions and added 1 kiwi and used some red chili pepper flakes to add some kick.  It was a hit!  I think I will try it with the red onion next time, but still add the kiwi and the "kick".

I made this quickly last night to go along with halibut tacos - it was terrific!  I doubled the recipe and barely had any left.  It is a good idea not to use an overripe mango - very messy.  It wasn't pretty looking (due to mangled mango) but it sure tasted good!

I love this salsa. I threw all of it in a blender to save time. I grilled portobello mushrooms with some cajun season, salt, and pepper...topped it with the salsa and it was delicious. A great vegetarian entre with some flair!

This is excellent.  I made with red spicy peppers instead since I couldn't find habeneros at Vons.  Bit hit.  I did add a touch of balsamic vinegar to the mix.  Definately make this one again and double it.

I admit that my mangoes were very sweet.  Perhaps using less 'ripe' mango would have been helpful.  The sweetness overpowered the dish, especially since avocadoes are mild in flavor.  I used the zest from half of the lime, and ended up adding a bit of minced garlic to try to distract from the sweetness and add a level of flavor.  Thanks for the recipe, but I think the 'tomato, avocado and mango salsa' recipe is a bit nicer due to the addition of the tangy tomato.

This was fantastic! Served it over lime-marinated grilled Salmon, I didn't have any habanero peppers so I added some red bell pepper and used some red pepper flakes, the avocado (nature's butter) and the mango are PERFECT compliments to salmon (or any fish really, Mahi Mahi would be fabulous too!), I made enough for one serving (maybe a wee bit more than one) and I ate every single bit of it! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I used jalepeno instead of habaneros because I didn't want to burn my face off. Also - teeny tip - I recently discovered jarred mango. I am normally a huge advocate of fresh fruit/veggies, but mangos in a jar are fabulous. No peeling, pitting, or wondering if it's going to be a pulpy or bitter little stinker. They seem a bit pricey until you realize how much mango gets thrown out because of the pitfalls. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this to take to our friends sons high school graduation party and it was the hit of the party. Really. It was. With so much other good food to enjoy, my dish was number one. A great, simple recipe with a beautiful presentation with all the pretty colors and fresh look appeal. I will definitely be making this again and sharing the recipe with 4 other women at the party that asked for it! Thanks for a real keeper!

This recipe is aMAZing! It has the perfect amount of habanero. We are vegetarian - so eating it with chips as a starter salsa was perfect. A+

1 lime is too much lime juice, but it was tasty despite.  I used serrano peppers instead of habaneros because I wasn't sure I could handle the habaneros, but the serranos weren't bad either.

Used 3 mangos, 2 avacados, 1 1/2 jalapenos, and one bunch of cilantro w/ 1 onion.  You could really tweak to your liking.  I really loved this salsa and so did everyone else in the fam. thanks.

Wonderful!  I didn't have a habanero pepper, but I did have a jalapeno so I used that instead.  I thought it was going to be really spicy, but the avocado cut the heat.  I tasted this without the avocado and it didn't taste right (and it was extremely spicy)- the avocado definitely makes this salsa!  I also used lemon juice instead of lime.  I added a bunch more cilantro than called for in the recipe.  I even added a pinch of sugar because our mango was a bit on the tart side.  I put the salsa over baked chicken and my husband and I also ate it with "Hint of Lime" tortilla chips.  YUMMY!  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe. I used 2 avocados, seeded & minced jalapenos for the warm glow w/out the bite, added a little olive oil, freshly ground black pepper & way more cilantro. Great in grilled chicken wraps for an easy & heart healthy lunchbox option.

Wow! This was so easy and so delicious.  I forgot to buy a habanero pepper at the grocery store, so I substituted with two teaspoons of chile paste.  I think I might actually like that better because I can make it more or less spicy depending on the crowd.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This salsa is phenomenal.  I have made it twice in the last week and everyone who has tried it has killed it and each time I have doubled the recipe.  Addictive and amazing.

Oh wow, I can't get enough of this salsa!  I served it on top of salmon burgers for dinner and it was amazing!   Really filling too. What wasn't finished at dinner was eaten later as a dip for pita chips.  The only change I made to this recipe was to add a jalapeno pepper instead of a habanero, and I thought that it added a great kick.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

I made this for a party and was given a lot of compliments.  I tripled the recipe, but stuck with one habanero to stay on the conservative. I forgot the cilantro, but I know it would be good with or without.

The family was skeptical...there were raised eyebrows.  I told them to eat it with their grilled chicken.  One bite...and some mumbles...more chewing...they had seconds...and it was all gone.  As my 15yo got up, hurrying back to his computer games, he mumbled, "Really good mom, make that one again."    Make sure you use fairly firm avocado and mango, though, or it gets mushy.  Can be made with a mild jalepeno, or lots of serranos for more heat.  Really, incredibly easy, versatile, and perfect with anything you serve.

Just soooooo good!  I doubled the recipe, but as I only had 1 mango from the season that has now ended locally, I added 1 small, sweet pineapple as it is also a tropical type fruit.  I have never seen habanero peppers in South Africa, so used 2 green chillies with seeds (could have used some more, even red chillies).  I found sweet jalapenos, and added one chopped. I was able to get excellent seeded tortilla wraps, bought creme fraische, stir fried a couple of chicken breasts (sliced), and we filled our wraps with this.  Absolutely delicious!  Will definitely be making this salsa again (and will try the canned mango someone referred to also, until it is mango season again).  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

This is good but a little dry, needs to be made and have the next day so it can develop some juice, but overall good flavor.

We had this on fish tacos and it was absolutely amazing! I used 2 jalapenos instead of the habanero but other than that I followed it exactly. I like the consistency better with the avocado softened so I think its a good idea to stir it quite a bit.

I left out the pepper, everything else according to recipe.  Served it as an appetizer at a dinner party and everyone liked it and complimented me on it.  I'd make it again as an app, but it wasn't  extremely special in my opinion.  I'll probably keep looking for a salsa recipe, but this was a great recipe to serve with fish tacos.

I used a yellow onion (all I had) and ommitted the habaneros (used green blee pepper, all I had).  This was very yummy, will definately make it again.

OMG...this is amazing and super easy! I brought this salsa to every party last summer and people wanted to hide out and eat it with a spoon! I don't add the hot pepper but everyone loves it - with chips or on fish or grilled pork, it's great.

what beautiful flavours.  I made this for a salsa over tilapia(fish) and instead of avocado I used corn.  Next time I will try with avocado though. make a bit ahead for the flavours to mix together

I made this the other night with the "Blackened Fish" recipe found on this site as well.  It was excellent and just what I was looking for to balance out the spice in the fish recipe.  I have tried other salsas similar to this one but they used oil which I didn't find necessary.  I couldn't find habaneros so I used a jalapeno pepper instead.  I also added some diced papaya since I had that handy and I diced up 1/2 of a cucumber that I needed to use up.  Loved this recipe and will definitely make it again!!

I made this to take to a party, doubling the recipe and substituting red bell pepper for the habanero. The red bell added some nice color, by the way, I'd throw one in just for that reason, even if you are using a spicy pepper, too. The guests raved about how good this salsa was! Simple and fresh with a great flavor. Thanks!

I'm not a huge fan of mango in salsa but I made it anyway for my family.  Everybody loved it! I followed the directions, but used 2 avocados, 1 jalapeno pepper (instead of a habanero pepper), and I added pineapple tidbits.

This was amazing. Our fruits were perfectly ripe so that enhanced the overall dish. I used jalapeno instead of the habanero but it was so mild I might add more spice next time. I also left out the onion because I don't care for raw onion.

Fantastic.  I, like others have used jalapenos in place of the habanero, and/or used one of each when doubling recipes.

This is a delicious and refreshing salsa.  I had to substitute lemon juice for the lime and cayanne pepper for for the jalepeno. (Since that was all that I had.)  Made it twice in 3 days.  Served it with salmon first and then on toasted corn tortias and refried beans.  YUM...will look forward to the next time. I'm sure that you'll enjoy it too!

I've been making this for a while now & just realized I have never reviewed it!  I make it a lot, and 1/2 the time eat it on it's own!  This is a fabulous recipe as is - I love it most just after it's  freshly made, when it is refrigerated the texture changes and it becomes a little less appealing.

Excellent!
I quadrupled this recipe (4x) since we were having company over and it was a crowd-pleaser. I didn't have habernos but instead used about 6 of the thin, small Thai hot chillies and it was just perfect.

Yum!  Only change I made was to use a can of mild green chilies instead of hot peppers as I knew my family wouldn't touch it otherwise.  Made the full batch and my 4 guys ate it all.  Will be making again for sure!

I made this last night to compliment some blackened fish tacos, and all I can say is, WOW! This salsa was phenomenal! My local grocer didn't have habanero peppers, so I opted for two small jalapenos (very finely chopped). I can't wait to make this again!

Delicious! I added about 2 Tbs. fresh mint along with the cilantro, it added to the freshness! 
Like others, I substituted about 2/3 C minced red bell pepper, and 1/2 large jalapeño instead of the habanero (we're wimps in my house). Even my super finicky husband loved it!

I make salsa exactly like this but I use a generous amount of Cayenne instead of the habanero.  Much easier and still great taste. Also you can make a delicious salad from the same recipe by adding about an equal part of diced jicama, maybe 2 more limes worth of juice and serve on baby spinach or greens of your choice. YUM!

Needed to make this for a large crowd so I made a test run for my hubby and I to try. It was yummy as written; however, I did make a couple of small changes when I made the larger batch. I scaled the cilantro down to a 'to taste' and used garlic salt to taste. Apparently I didn't make enough as this salsa was one of the first to get devoured. Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was great. I was worried about it being too hot, but the pepper was the perfect amount of heat. This will become a regular in our house!

We absolutely loved this salsa. I used it with the Shrimp Cakes from this site and it was heavenly. I used jalapenos because that's what I had on hand. Other than that, I made it as per the recipe. This one's a keeper!

This was delicious! We used a jalapeno instead of a habanero and added red bell pepper. Also added black pepper, though the recipe didn't call for it. It didn't make very much. I'd probably have to quadrouple this for a family gathering :) Definitely a keeper!

I made this last evening and added pickled banana peppers (sub for the hot pepper) and fresh pineapple.  I LOVED IT.  I am making more this weekend for a summer get together with my friends and family.

Simply amazing. I made this to go with some blackened tilapia tacos, and more people were interested in eating it by itself than with the meal! I would recommend using the habenero. It's not overpowering and gives the salsa a little kick.

Excellent!  Unless somebody is REALLY afriad of hot stuff - dont be afraid of the peppers.  When fully seeded a lot of their punch is missing.  I leave some seeds in for greater kick!

A wonderful, fresh and adaptable salsa!
I used green onion and added a little fresh pineapple diced. The beauty is, if you serve something spicy lessen or eliminate  the jalepeno/habanero. This recipe also works for acid reflux victims without the hot pepper. It's a Keeper.

This was delicious and fresh! I slightly changed and add 2 avocados, 2 mangos, half of a very large red onion, a big jalapeño (removed seeds & ribs)instead of habanero and substitute parsley for cilantro (my husband doesn't like cilantro that much). I didn't put any salt but add some freshly ground black pepper and a touch of chipotle. I also used 2 limes instead of one. Yesterday was Cinco de mayo and I served this along with fish en papillotte; my guests were raving about it. Definitely a keeper for hot summer days. Thank you for sharing. Revised: I added red pepper and I find it's much better. Give it a try

My husband made something similar the other night, only added a small, fresh tomato diced too. Even better the following day! The lime juice and mango kept the avocado from oxidizing making it still pretty appealing. Ate with fish and would definitely make again!

Awesome recipe. Many of the other salsa recipes call for oil or other unnecessary ingredients. I used only half of the lime juice because the salsa seemed really moist already (possibly because the mango was pretty ripe) but that turned out great, the lime is very potent so it doesn't even need the whole lime. I also used a jalapeno pepper instead of the habanero because I've never used habanero and wasn't sure if they were too hot or not hot enough for me. Didn't want to chance it. Next time I'll try them.

AMAZING!! I used 1 large jalapeno pepper seeded and chopped small, did not have habanero at my local store, did not use salt.  Had it with grilled chicken breast, but I would eat this with many things or just tortilla chips, excellent. THANKS for sharing.

So yummy!

I substituted sweet brown onion for the red onion (as they have been bitter the last few times). It was delicious! Dreaming of making it again.

This gets five stars if you are able to have avocado and mango locally. I first made this while at school in Hawai'i with avocados from the backyard and scavenged mangoes. Coming back to a temperate region the flavors in long shipped produce usually can't compare.

Very good!  I had to leave out the hot peppers due to a food alergy of one of the people I was serving, but it was still wonderful.  The flavor and texture were terrific!  I served it with wedges of grilled naan.

Easy and delicious! I used sweet onion, and a jalepeno instead of habenero pepper. Served with tuna steaks and garlic rice--really went well. Next time will use the red onion for a little more bite.

I used only a fraction of the red onion called for, probably 2 tablespoons and it was delicious.It is wonderful on grilled salmon,tuna or almost any fish. I also used jalepeno as it was what i had on hand... wonderful recipe and simple to make!!

I made this recipe twice this weekend and it was a hit both times.  I did not put the habanero pepper in it as I like a little spice, but not too hot.  So, I used a half of jalepeno and a half of a red bell pepper chopped to give it some more color.  The second time I made it, I used an avocado that was not as ripe and the pieces of the salsa were not so mushed up.  I thought that it looked better, still tasted as good and my guestrs liked it either way.  Great recipe.

Be sure your mango and avocado are both just barely ripe. You need a firm fruit or you get a slimy mess (That was my rookie mistake). That said, the recipe is excellent. I soaked the red onion to mellow the flavor and used serrano peppers [because they are in my garden ;) ] This is a go to side for Pork Carnitas.

Added Serrano peppers instead of Habaneros because my family prefer less heat.  I say bring on the heat but i can amp it up on my plate.  We also added pineapple, garlic, olive oil and cucumber and less cilantro.

So good! I would use 1 1/2 limes vs 1 and 1 1/2 - 2 avocados, though. I made this as a side to the Black Beans and Pork Chops recipe. Great dinner!

In all fairness, I cut up and refrigerated everything BUT the avocado for a couple of hours so that may have had an effect on the outcome, but the onion was just too much. That was ALL we could taste. The next time I make it, I'll cut it back to maybe like 1/4 of a red onion. I'll update my review should my opinion change!

This is a WOW dish.  I made it twice, and I prefer it with a seeded jalapeño pepper (milder) and chopped green onion (rather than red).  Guests all asked for the recipe.  You must have very fresh avocado and mango and lime juice to achieve the perfect combination.  I'll make it again.

I did change it a tad.  I did not use cilantro (don't like it) and instead of habanero pepper, I used a jalapeno pepper.  My husband and I loved this on a BBQ grilled pork chop.

While I like all ingredients, when combined they became mush between the time made and time served. Just the texture was a turnoff!  Sorry.

Excellent while fresh, but all tastes marry if kept overnight, making the individual ingredients of this lovely salsa indistinguishable.

This recipe is defiantly a keeper in my house.  We had it with salmon tonight and already I'm thinking of other users--on fish tacos perhaps.  I might even use it for waffle topping  :-D

It great taste and easy to make.  I recommend that you at the avocado last and stir in gently so it does not get mushy. 
Goes great with a fish dish.

Good stuff!  I followed the suggestions of other commenters replacing oil & vinegar with lime juice and fresh chopped cilantro.  Perfect.  Served with Cajun grilled shrimp.  A great pairing.

A refreshing treat!  I exchanged the habanero pepper for a Jalapeño since I didn't want it too spicy.  I also used just 1/2 a lime and it was plenty for one cup or mango and 1/2 avocado.  This was used with Tilapia Fish Tacos and delicious!  I still have some leftover that I will combine with black beans - YUMMY!

I made this to serve with grilled chicken.  The store was out of habaneros so I used Serrano peppers instead.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Was delicious!  The only thing I would change is add another avocado next time.

Excellent recipe!  I brought some over to my parnt's house and put it on top of some grilled Mahi Mahi steaks.  Wonderful!  We ate the rest of the salsa with chips.  They asked me for the recipe and made it for other visiting family who also raved about it.

Delish! I already bought ingredients to make it again. I used two mangos and two avocados, because if one is good, two is better, right? Also, the store was out of purple onions so I used a sweet white one. And, I couldn't find the habanero peppers so I used red bell peppers. I made this to put over halibut; I am going to make it again for dipping chips. Yum!!

This is super yummy, it has a little bit of heat from the habenero. I only used 1/2 red onion, a whole one seemed to be too much. This will definitely be at my next BBQ.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delightful. Maybe my little habanero wasn't ripe (it was bright orange) but my salsa did not have any kick (was still quite tasty) so next time I think I'll add some red pepper flakes as others have suggested.

Everyone I have made this for loves it. I do use jalapeno instead of habanero but that is just personal preference. I serve it on grilled tilapia with mango salsa(I bake it)also from this site. I prefer this mango salsa to the one with the tilapia recipe. We are having this for dinner tonight for several reasons. 1. I found ripe mangos at the store yesterday. 3. Great way to do Friday fish. 3. This salsa and the tilapia taste like spring to me and with -11 degrees this morning I really need to feel like spring. SO delicious, can't wait for dinner!

I made a mellow version of the salsa with red bell peppers and lime marinade salmon and jasmine rice, bottom line outstanding meal. My husband loved it and so did I. I threw the cilantro, onion,lime and a smidge of virgin olive oil in my bullet and blended it to release the full flavor.

I left off the cilantro  because I'm not a fan, but it wasn't missed at all. Still totally tasty! It was hard to control myself and not eat the whole thing in one go. My only advice is to make double.

be careful with the onions 2 much will really rip the recipe.  I also think you should have more mango than avocado (maybe a big mango for small size avocado?), and as written many times, take hard ones so it doesn't get all mushy. To me it was ok but nothing amazing.  My mom could not eat it but you either love or hate cilantro I guess!

This recipe was a hit with the family.  I used a Jalapeno pepper instead.  It was nicely hot but not too hot.

Very good! I used a jalapeno instead of a habanera - I'm wimpy. Everything else as in recipe - it almost didn't make it onto the table. Yum! And healthy, I think.

I used calamari steaks (4) for the meat. Chopped some lettuce placed the the sliced calamari on that and topped with this Delicious salsa. I wasnt sure if he would like it, and was hoping to take extra steak and sauce to work but someone had 2nd helpings and now I need to make this again. Very Good I made something like this 20 years ago with black beans and my friends thought I was nuts for making such a combination was good then before things like this got popular.  I will have to but some prawns for tonights meal!

This is also good with some strawberries chopped into it, if you want to sweeten it up a bit.

I just made this salsa and it was yummy! I did use jalapeno pepper instead of habanero. It's a great combo between sweet mango and creamy avocado.
