This recipe is a fabulously simple idea.  I did it a little differently, brushing the mushroom caps with garlic butter and letting it bake in the oven that way, then doing the blue cheese bit.  It was so delicious, and yet so uncomplicated to prepare.  Great flavour combination - the melted blue cheese is just enough to give it some kick.

Yum.  I made the recipe as is but then added a few finishing touches.  I made a balsamic reduction with balsamic vinegar and a little brown sugar.  Once the mushrooms were done, I drizzled them with the reduction and topped them with toasted pine nuts.  They came out like the mushrooms at one of my favorite establishments.  I will be making these again and again!

I loved this recipe! I toasted a couple buns, sauteed roasted red peppers and onions, and we had awesome sandwiches! The only thing I would recommend would be to make sure that your baking sheet is sprayed with cooking spray, so that the mushrooms don't stick. Thanks--I will definitely be making this again!

FANTASTIC!!  I made this exactly as noted and it was wonderful!  I was so tempted to add other things and decided not to so that I'd really know what the recipe would taste like as written. (Well, I didn't measure the soy sauce - I just held my finger over the top of the bottle and shook it over the 2 portobello mushrooms).  

I will definitely be making these again!

Add'l Note -  I have since altered the recipe by seasoning the mushrooms as noted and then stuffed with a mixture of chopped mushrooms(I buy 4 mushrooms, chop one up and stuff the other 3), 1/2 of a chopped onion and 2 links of turkey sausage (either Italian or Cajun).  I cook them about 20 min in a 400 degree oven.  Topped with the bleu cheese at the end. The are absolutely delicious!!

Love this recipe.  It can be tweaked in many ways and the cooking time is perfect.  I sometimes add a little fresh garlic and Vietnamese hot sauce (with the green cap and rooster on the bottle) to the initial cooking time...yum! I make it at least every other week.

Excellent recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I added some olive oil because I put them on the grill instead of the oven and they came out perfect--the portobello's were tender, meaty and cheesy.  yum!

I made these as an appetizer for my husband and 6 of his friends.  They absolutely loved them! Three even asked me for the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and were a HUGE hit!  Thank you, Dianne, for submitting this recipe.

This is a very nice recipe as is, but the second time I made it I like it even more by using a couple splashes of worshestire sauce instead of soy sauce...it really pairs with the "meaty" taste of this dish.  I also spread on some garlic salt over the top of the mushroom before adding the cheese.  Next time I will follow a few other reviews and add some sauteed red bell pepper on top.  You MUST like blue cheese for this recipe....please don't rate recipes low if a food listed in the NAME of the recipe is one you don't like!!!

Easy to make, and easy to customize.  I used feta instead of bleu cheese and drizzled with olive oil instead of soy sauce.  Also topped with sauteed sweet peppers.  YUM.  Will definitely make again!

We thought these were good but so rich; next time I will use less blue cheese and will experiment with different cheeses such as Asiago, 3 cheese mixture from my deli, etc. and will add garlic.  I did feel the cooking time was slightly too long as I like the texture a little more firm.  I will try cooking a total of 25 minutes.

It has been a while since I LOVED a recipe so much that I would make it every week.  Well, this is it!  I cooked the portobella in my toaster oven on a foil lined pan (easy clean-up) and lightly sprayed the foil with pam.  I also added a little garlic but it would be great without.  The mushroom was so juicy when I pulled it out of the oven, I'm not sure how it would hold up in a sandwich but I could see myself serving it over rice or pasta.  I also think any strong cheese such as feta would work well.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and I think regular soy sauce combined with a salty, strong cheese would result in a dish that's too salty.  (You must love blue cheese and mushrooms to like this recipe.)  Again, I LOVED the recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!!!!

Overall I thought this was good but I think I would prefer it with a milder cheese like mozzarella.  I used lite soy sauce but otherwise followed the recipe.  I will make again but next time I will spray the pan first as they were a little difficult to remove.

So easy, delicious, "comfort food". I try to eat vegetarian, but my boyfriend is a big meat eater, and he found this filling and "meaty". I served it with a side of cous cous, and it seemed to be the perfect mixture. You can even put some soy sauce on the cous cous to tie it in together. GREAT DISH!

If I could give  this more stars, I would. Went over well with both vegetarian and meat lovers.  Small changes, added olive oil and balsamic vinegar to soy sauce before roasting in oven and then added toasted pine nuts with the blue cheese as someone else had suggested.  I cannot imagine this without the pine nuts.  Served with 2 other allrecipe favorite: roasted potatoes w/basil tom & garlic,  and broccoli slaw.

I expected a lot more from this recipe based on the rave reviews it has received. I was quite disappointed. I like blue cheese and I love portobello mushrooms, but this was not the recipe for me. Perhaps it was the soy sauce, but I followed the recipe exactly as it is written, and my husband and I could not even finish our plates. I love the concept of roasted portobello with cheese on top, so I think I will try this with olive oil as someone else suggested, along with some sauteed garlic and onion and a milder cheese that melts better. The blue cheese overpowered the flavor of the mushroom.

Very easy to follow recipe! I did change it slightly however since my hubby does not like soy sauce (lol). I used Worcestershire sauce (teaspoons, not tablespoons) and used applewood smoked bacon blue cheese crumbles (modestly), made into a burger and even though it was a little messy it was simple and yummy. Nothing overpowered the mushroom taste which is what I wanted. Thank you for inspiring me and making a wonderfully easy recipe.:-)

Outstanding - a keeper!  I changed it a little using a balsamic glaze in place of the soy sauce.  Added a pinch of garlic powder and black ground pepper. Brought to a cookout & all raved.  Making again this weekend - just that good.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, although my wife found so much blue cheese a bit too rich for her tastes.  Only changes I made were to add some chopped garlic and then to drizzle some melted butter on top. Yum!

Pretty good recipe.  We may try it with Worcestershire or Teriyaki instead of Soy sauce next time.  Added some roasted peppers and garlic powder.

I found these to be much to salty for my taste.  I will probably try again with reduced-sodium soy sauce or even with just a few drops of Worcestershire.  Easy to make, though, and a good accompaniment to a nice grilled steak.

My husband loved them, but I thought they were painfully salty..but could see the potential. I brushed the bottoms with a good olive oil (and they did not stick to my pyrex).  Way too much soy sauce -- next time I will thin it with chicken broth, perhaps.  I ate it with a bland, creamy pasta--cut up the mushrooms and threw them in--and it solved the saltiness problem

I usually follow recipes to the T when first making them.  1 Tablespoon is way way way too much for this recipe.  The mushrooms bottoms were drowning in soy sauce and we ended up eating just the cheese out of it.

I thought this was really good. I think i put too much soy sauce because the mushrooms were really liquidy. My falt though. Otherwise the mushrooms were so tender and moist, and the flavors went so well together! totally will make again

Really good, the only thing that I added was worchester sauce and I used feta cheese instead of blue cheese. Over all great recipe I will be making this again!!:-)

Easy and delicious! I followed the recipe as is. It does make a mess on the baking sheet, but lining it with foil makes the clean up easy.

How can something this easy taste so good? I served these like steak, with mashed potatoes and carrots, and a little worcestershire. Definitely will do this again...and again...and again!

Delicious, and so easy. I had mine on toasted rosemary focaccia with a mixture of 1 tbsp mayo, 1 1/2 tsp dijon and 1/2 tsp tarragon spread on it. It was heavenly. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I used the cooking times and temps. But I put A1 BBQ sauce instead of soy and grated Parm cheese because I didn't have blue cheese on hand. It turned out great.

Yummy combo of flavours. Next time I will try another reviewer's idea to make a balsmaic vinegar/brown sugar reduction to drizzle on top with toasted pine nuts! Thanks.

These shrink A LOT in the oven so it's best to use GINORMOUS caps.  I grease the cookie sheet, add garlic and a little balsalmic.  Don't knock the soy sauce.  My white bread BF thought adding soy sauce to everything was weird and gross, but now he has seen the light.  I end up baking these about 6 minutes.  I like to serve these with "Pork chops with blue cheese gravy"  and sauteed onions.  I also add a little soy sauce to the blue cheese gravy--Try it, it's good...

This is my FAVORITE!!!  So fast and simple to prepare and SOOOO yummy! I roast the mushrooms in my toaster oven, and then add hamburger buns near the end to toast. That's all you need for a fast and easy lunch!

I'm rating this recipe a neutral three, because I don't feel I can give a fair assessment. I just want to note one thing, though: if you are going to try this recipe you should make sure you like blue cheese first!  I tried this out because it really sounded good to me, but when it came down to eating it, neither my boyfriend nor I liked it at all.  The combination of the mushroom and the blue cheese flavors was just too overpowering (the earthy, fungus flavor). I thought I would like it because I like blue cheese dressing and, you know, the dip for hot wings, but this was a waaaaay different flavor than those.  I'm not sure if it was the cheese I bought or what (used Boar's Head) but I will not be trying this again.

These were OK, but the juice from the mushrooms (I used small portabellos), combined with the soy, made quite a mess on my baking sheets.  I used paper towels to soak up the liquid before putting the cheese on.  They tasted all right, but not worth the mess.

SOOOOOO GOOD!!  Made these for dinner last night (used 4 mushrooms that were small-medium sized) and sprinkled with pepper and a bit of granulated garlic before drizzling with low sodium soy.  Baked as called for and topped with light feta at the end and put back in for 10 mins or so (didn't have blue cheese and hubby doesn't really like it anyway).  Fabulous, easy and DELISH!

I have made this probably a hundred times. If ever I have a reason to make dinner just for me (and not the rest of my family) this is my go-to. I make it exactly as written and then I add two things: Toasted pine nuts (that I toast in the toaster oven while the mushrooms are roasting - you have to watch them closely so they don't burn) and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. SO DELICIOUS.

Fantastic recipe for all the mushroom lovers & wished I could give it 10 stars.  Followed the recipe exactly the first time and tried it the 2nd time with reduced fat Italian cheese blend (health reasons) &  still came out great. Next time I will serve these yummies  on onion buns as a meatless meal.

Portobellos are so good  with blue cheese.  Anxious to try it on a toasted bun for a vegetarian option.

We happened to have 2 large portabello mushroom caps (got them in an organic produce box).  Never having used them before, I looked for recipes.  My husband loves blue cheese, so I made these, substituting olive oil for the soy sauce.  I applied the blue cheese liberally.  We loved them!  Meaty, with the tangy flavor of blue cheese.  So simple!  We ate them on the patio while my husband grilled our dinner.  I can see how other ingredients would add a different twist.

Great in its simplicity, however comes out a bit too salty between the soy sauce and the salty blue cheese.  Lower sodium soy sauce may be of benefit here, and next time (there will be a next time) I may try some Worcestershire instead, or brush with an oil/chopped garlic concoction.

Simple with a ton of flavor. Definitely choose Worcestershire reduced sodium over soy sauce. It will not be as salty and the meaty mushrooms are complimented better with the Worcestershire sauce.
Thank You for Sharing. We really enjoy this dish. Hands Down.

I liked it very much even the after taste of soy sauce and blue cheese was pretty strong. I could taste it all day long (we had it for lunch).

This was really good. I used this recipe, added minced garlic and a bun and made it for my family this past weekend with baked steak fries, they loved it!

The only thing I noticed was the salt, you may want to leave out the extra salt and just add pepper since the blue cheese and Soy sauce is alredy pretty salty. 

Weight Watchers friendly meal - 4 pnts (depending on the bun)

I thought this was good but my mushrooms seemed to shrivel a bit. I don't know if they are supposed to do that, but I would have liked them to be jucier. I also expected the cheese to melt...but that was my dumb mistake.

i think this would have been better if the portobellos were put on the grill.  No flavor except for the blue cheese.  Try adding some worchestershire sauce.  Did not care for this recipe at all.

These were okay.  The soy sauce was fine but not outstanding.  The "Portobello Mushroom Burgers" recipe on this site is better.

We loved this recipe.  I did add more low salt soy sauce and blue cheese than recipe listed.  I believe it us up to the individual on measurements.

These were a Super Bowl party hit!  Because we are watching our carbs, we didn't use the buns and used the smaller mushrooms.I took one of the reviewers advice and used red peppers, which was great.  We've had them three times already!

Really liked this. Went a little to heavy on the blue cheese I think. It just needs a sprinkling to get the right hint of flavor. All in all will definately make this again. Even my two year old loved it!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it came out wonderful! My husband can't have mushrooms so he will be missing out the next time I make it. It's definitely worth trying if you like mushrooms and blue cheese. Great flavor together!
