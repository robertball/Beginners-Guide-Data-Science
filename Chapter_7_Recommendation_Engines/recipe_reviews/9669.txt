These were a disappointment. My concept of gingersnaps is a rather flat, crispy cookie with a lot of "snap" when you bite into them. These exit the oven with the same shape as you put them in with. What you see is exactly what you get.  I followed the instructions and flattened slightly. Wrong. They come out too thick and instead of the crisp, they're just, plain dry. Maybe flattening them more would help, but that's only a guess. Additionally, there is not enough ginger flavor. Gingersnaps are supposed to have a spicy "bite." These don't come close. Even doubling the amount of that ingredient and rolling in sugar laced with more ginger didn't help. They needed more "kick." I suspect that decreasing the amount of flour back to 2 cups, adding a tsp of soda and increasing the ginger to 1 Tb might help. However, that's a little too labor intensive to suit me. I'm going to cut my losses on this one and keep up my quest for the perfect gingersnap.

Very salty, They just don't taste like traditional gingersnaps.
