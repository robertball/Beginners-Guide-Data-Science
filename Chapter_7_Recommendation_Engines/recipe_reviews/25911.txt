Wow! This takes a plain 'ol tomato sandwich to a whole new level with a nice Italian twist! I toasted some thick slices of Italian bread and added a bit of salt to the tomatoes. I decreased the amount of herbs in the mayo mixture a bit to taste. I also added some fresh basil over top of the tomatoes and a bit of mozzarella cheese along with the Parmesan. The balsamic marinade on the tomatoes really adds a nice tang to the sandwich - delish!

A DEFINATE KEEPER! A so simple recipe that yields a so delicious sandwich! My only mods were adding 50% more of each herb, salting the tomatos after marinading and adding more cheese for the "bubbly effect". EXCELLENT WITH CREAMY SOUP! and great for appetizers when served in bite sized pieces open-faced! AND THE MARINADE CAN BE EASILY CONVERTED INTO A NICE VINEGRETTE, instead of having to throw it away or boil it.

This is a terrific recipe.  I made it in August when tomatos are at their peak flavor, but I can see making it in the winter with fresh plum tomato.  Also because it was summer I added fresh chopped herbs to the mayo mixture, parsley, rosemary and basil.  As it was a poolside lunch, I put the prepared sandwiches on a foil lined, thick cookie sheet and put it on the grill and closd the lid for about 5 minutes.  But broiling would give it a bubbly top.  Also, THICK DENSE bread is a MUST!  And remember to toast the bread first.  Thank you so much for this recipe, my daughter the vegetarian even asked for the recipe.

There isn't enough I can say about this recipe. I wish I could give it more stars!! I did change a few things due to not having them. I used Newmans Own Olive Oil and Vinegar (a salad dressing) instead of your sauce but it was close enough. I also used sliced american cheese. It was amazing! My mouth is still watering! And as for the mayo..gosh it was heavenly. I did add some garlic powder like a few others suggested which made it even better. When I put it in the oven I was already waiting for it to come out! It smelt great and was so good! I love it so much that I created an account here JUST to review it. Thank you so much for this mouthwatering recipe!

Great recipe!  I marinated thinly sliced red onion along with the tomatoes, used a little less of the Parmesan, and added a thin slice of Swiss cheese.  Also, since my husband loves BLT's, added a few pre-cooked slices of bacon to his before adding the tomato/onion topping and the cheese -- he loved it!!

These were fantastic!!  The mayo/parmesan mixture is a must.  What a great blend of flavors...I wish I had made more for myself.  When I took it out from under the broiler, there was quite a bit of liquid on top.  I just soaked it up with a paper towel and it didn't compromise the taste at all.  Next time I might try fat free mayo to cut down on the calories, but other than that these were awesome.  Two thumbs up kat!!

Very tasty and quick!  My husband and I loved the fresh taste.  A good quality, dense bread is a must.  Next time will try a mixture of tomatoes and roasted red peppers.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

WOW! My wife about fell off the couch after she tasted these! All she could say was "mmmm...." followed by some mumbling as she enjoyed these tomato sandwiches. The only change was I used fresh multi-grain bread and fresh grated Parmesan. Excellent! We have made it twice in the past week!

This recipe has become a staple for me in the past few months! It is so simple yet incredible. I make it for lunch, serve it open faced as an appetizer and sometimes as part of dinner. The most important part is procuring the ripe tomatoes. If I can't find ripe tomatoes at my produce stand, I won't make it. I slice them thick and only differ from the recipe in that I add a little garlic powder to the mayo spread and salt the tomato slices before adding the parm on top. This recipe is so good that you really should try it as is before you start throwing your own ideas in. I have impressed many a guest with this one. PERFECT!

This was delicious!  Toasted tomato sandwiches have always been a favorite of mine, even as a kid.  I didn't marinate the tomatoes, as I was using fresh beefsteak tomatoes from the Farmer's Market.  I used mayo, parmesan, pepper, Club House italiano seasoning and garlic powder.  Spread the mixture on a bun and broiled until brown and bubbly.  Then added tomato.  DELICIOUS!!  Awesome with a salad for a light tasting supper on a warm summer evening!!  Thanks Kat!  EDITED:  I still do not marinate the tomatoes, but I do use a balsamic glaze that I drizzle over the top of each tomato once I have broiled the buns.  DELISH!!!

I really really liked this.  Didn't make any changes except to drizzle a little of the vinegar over the sandwiches as well.

4/11/03  This time I did make a few changes, marinated the tomatoes in balsamic vinegar only (no oil) and mixed mayo and basil pesto with the parmesan for the spread.  It is really good that way too.  I always use foccacia bread.

We *LOVED* these...my husband gave me a thumbs up and an "excellent!" on the first bite. I followed the recipe exactly, *except* that I added a very thin pan-fried chicken breast seasoned with lemon pepper, dill and garlic to each sandwich. While these would be absolutely fantabulous on their own, I just wanted the extra protein for our meal. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe that I'll use OFTEN! ETA: I never do this, but I had leftover chicken, so we had the exact same meal two nights in a row. These are just that good.

Great open faced sandwich!  We loved the balsamic vinegar in this.  I made the recipe as written with just a few exceptions.  I used one huge garden tomato and made three open faced sandwiches.  I used fresh parsley and I added a couple of whole basil leaves to each sandwich under the tomato slice.  We thought the basil was a wonderful addition.  We enjoyed this one and will definitely make it again!

OH MY --- Are there even words to express the simple yet complex flavors of this masterpiece!!! My tongue was dancing with flavors!!!! It's brilliant this recipe, pretty much have all the ingredients on hand. i do suggest using your own fresh herbs, yum. ALSO, i have tried this on 3 different types of breads / rolls - white sandwich bread, slider rolls, as well as my homeade rolls, it doesn't even matter these come out gooey and fabulous! I also poured the extra oil / vinegar misture over the top, wich the parm seems to dance wtih. I will be making this the rest of my life. It was something you would taste at the million dollar priced Vegas resteraunts!! THAT GOOD! I wanted to add that i used garlic powder as well as a bit of crushed red pepper to the mayo. LOVE THESE!

Delicious! While I love plain old toasted tomato + mayo sandwiches, this was a really nice change! Loved the mayo mix especially, will use it on other sandwiches too!

This was ok.... needs meat. I like steak... so a nice thin cut or left over pot roast or something- ANYTHING would have made this much better. Next time I will add roast beef.

Delicious!  A nice, light summer dish. A great way to use up fresh tomatoes.  I used 4 Roma tomatoes and still had a lot left over so 2 regular tomatoes should be plenty.  Tried it on both Italian bread and wheat.  Liked the Italian, my husband and I agreed we didn't care for the wheat.  Served with soup and made a complete meal.

Yum, it is the best tomato sandwich, especially with a slice of fresh mozzarella underneath the tomatoes. I made them on leftover hamburger buns which was perfect. The second time I made them, I used thin sliced muenster and regular bread (which doesn't hold up well). You definitely need a thicker bread and I'll for sure be getting more fresh mozzarella before making them again. It's a great way to use up home grown tomatoes and have a nice dinner!

Made this on  garlic 4 cheese Texas toast and just put the mayo/parm mix on top of the cheese after I toasted the toast. I added freeze dried basil but fresh would be better and added parmesean on top of the tomatoes. It was very good! If you have someone who has to have a protien a quick fix is a fried egg in between the bread and tomatoes.

Made this for lunch today to accompany some soup. I followed the instructions, but probably used more fresh, grated Parmesan cheese than called for ; ). We had all of the ingredients on hand, and this was quick and easy to assemble (10 minutes total prep/broil time).  It also tasted delicious!!!!  My husband loved it too.  We will add this to our regular lunch rotation.

This was very good.  Be sure to put it in the oven open faced.  I then put the other side in for 1 minute to broil.

These were incredible! The marinated tomatoes were delicious, and all the flavors blended so well. I made them on Dutch crunch rolls, and I couldn't imagine a better choice. I also added swiss cheese. Everyone in the family loved them! The next day I re-arranged the ingrediants and it was even better. I added pesto and spinach, and did an open faced sandwich so it was more like a pizza. I would make them this way from now on, but they're delicious both ways.

We all loved these - the kiddies included if you'd believe it.  Excellent way to use up the leftover tomatoes from the garden.  We ate them on their own for lunch but they would compliment any kind of soup.  Will be making these over and over.

Yummy! This was quite good, but I think it would be even better with a thin slice of cheese on top, such as gruyere. I am going to try this next time. It is essential to use a hearty bread. I used a wheat french baguette.

Yummy, yummy to my tummy. I added a minced clove of garlic. Used Pillsbury French bread that you have to bake. Cut the dough in half so I had to loaves of bread and then just split them open to make my sandwiches. Thanks for sharing!

Used Italian bread, half the tomatoes, and slices of mozzarella cheese plus the mayo to create amazing open-faced sandwiches that made a great small lunch for 3 people.  I did not have the parsley or olive oil, but kept everything else basically the same.  Turned out great!!

VERY tasty. I'm giving it a 4 star b/c it was great, but didn't blow my socks off. However, I will definitely make this again. My husband really liked it, too. Made it exactly as written, only I used vine-ripened cherry tomatoes because the regular tomatoes at the store looked blah. I'd recommend this to a friend:) 

We had this with the Caesar Salad Supreme on this site (minus the anchovies) and it was a great combo!
Thanks, Katia!

Wow! we absolutely loved these! I can only imagine what they will taste like in the summer when tomatoes are at their peak! Somehow I was out of parmesan cheese (don't know how that happened) so I made the mayo mixture without it, put it on sliced hoagie rolls and topped with thinly sliced provolone cheese, then tomatoes. Served open-faced and they were so delicious. I can't wait to make them with the parmesan!

*I* thought this was wonderful - - - of course, I messed up and didn't fully toast the bread before broiling, so hubby's sandwich became soft and squishy and he complained (totally my fault); HOWEVER, the flavors were simply fantastic.  Note to self: you want fully toasted (brown) bread and keep tomato slices meaty, but not *too* thick.  I used homemade honey oat bread which added a nice touch of sweetness.

I wish I could give this recipe TEN stars! This has to be my most favorite summer sandwich...EVER! I will only make this with fresh, homegrown tomatoes. I probably make this 2-3 times a WEEK in the summer and I can't get enough of it. The taste is SO good! You MUST make this sandwich! I use a pie plate to marinate my tomatoes and it works perfectly...since I only make one sandwich at a time (for me!)!

This is a fabulous yet simple recipe.  It tastes just wonderful this time of the year with fresh garden tomatoes.  I am sure you could adapt it to make small appetizer-sized sandwiches by using toasted French bread baguette slices or cutting toasted regular bread slices into quarters.  You could perhaps dice the tomatoes to make eating a little easier on these smaller portions.  Seasonings can be adjusted easily to individual tastes.  This recipe is a definite "keeper".  Great recipe!

pretty good and really easy to make.  The taste is a little bland though, but that may be due to my supermarket-bought middle-of-winter-tasteless-tomatoes.

TERRIFIC! I used one large average sliced tomato and had it on wheat bread. It made enough for three sandwiches so I totated 2 more pieces of bread. This would be great with a little shredded swiss added to the top before broiling.

Delicious recipe.  I made it with thickly-sliced toasted french bread and added some dried basil to the mayonaise spread.  Would be great with fresh basil in between the bread/spread and the tomatoes on top.  Enjoy!

This was an amazing sandwich, but being a cheese lover I used Romano instead of Parmesan cheese and I put it on the sandwich as well as in the sauce. I lasso sprinkled on a little cumin.

I've made this many times and it never fails to impress.  I dice the tomatoes (easier on the kiddos) and use fresh parmesan and have yet to find a nay-sayer on this.  Recipe does not state how long to marinate tomatoes, but I've done everything from 15 minutes to using the leftovers on more broiled sandwiches the next day and it always tastes wonderful.

I made this recipe almost exactly as stated; a little extra parmasan, a slice of monty jack under the tomatoes, Italian seasoning instead or oregano.  My husband raved about it and can't wait for the next time we have this.  We each could only eat one open-faced sandwich, and we had a California carrot and raisin salad alongside the sandwiches.  It was a really great light dinner.

Super yummy sandwich.  Great way to use fresh tomatoes from the garden!  Only change I made was to add shredded Italian cheese instead of the additional Parm on top of the tomato before broiling.

This was awesome! I replaced the oregano with Italian seasoning, and didn't bother to measure anything, and it turned out great. Definately pairs well with a cream soup for a quick and easy dinner after work!

This is incredibly delicious.  I've made it twice and both times my company went home with the recipe.  I've been using a crusty bread such as french or portuguese.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was so simple and delicious.  We used a fresh baguette and added a little mozzerella and fresh basil for taste.  My newly vegetarian 11 year old daughter gobbled it right up! Thank you sharing! Will definitely add to our favorites!

So yummy! only thing i would change is to add a little more sauce, the tomatoes overpowered it.

My mom said she thought she would never like a tomato sandwich!

fantastic sandwich! Followed the directions exactly and I was very pleased with the outcome. As with all dishes that involve a broiler, it's important to keep your eye on the oven because it can burn quickly. Thanks for the recipe!

Just tried this for lunch.  It was very delicious!  All the ingredients are things I have on hand all the time.  Simple, easy, and yummy!  Just make sure you don't marinate the tomatoes too long because the Balsamic  Vinegar can be a little to strong and over power the rest of the flavors.

SO good! I decided after trying it that it would be best by completely leaving out the olive oil. My husband and I are big balsamic vinegar lovers so I soak the tomatoes in only balsamic vinegar for about 10 minutes. I also add extra garlic and some mozarella. Amazing!

So easy to make and delicious too! Add your favorite herbs to the mayo. Try to drain some of the liquid out of the marinated tomatoes before putting it on the bread to prevent it from getting mushy. I just threw mine in the foreman grill and it turned out perfect! There's really no need to marinate the tomatoes overnight, I found that marinating the tomatoes for too long made the balsamic vinegar taste too strong.

Very good, but for my taste I think the tomatoes need to be cooked a bit longer. Also, when I made this recipe for the second time, I used slices of basil-flavored cheese, which I liked better than the Parmesan.

Absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to use light mircle whip instead of mayo. I am not a fan of mayo. I put it on thin sliced pumpernickel.

Let me start by saying that I have introduced this sandwich to a lot of friends and they have become big fans of it.  I tweak the recipe a bit: Slice tomato and place in bowl with the balsamic vinegar (no olive oil needed) while they are marinating I toast my bread and make the mayo mix.  After I put the mayo mix on both slices of toasted bread, put the marinated tomatos on one slice, top with some parmesan and bake it for 3- 5 minutes.  Add the top slice of toast and viola. Drizzle some balsamic vinagrette, top with other slice of toast and its ready to eat.

Very nice. I made this with Home Pride onion buns. I toasted the bun bottom half, spread the cheese mix on it, topped the bun with tomato/paper-thin sliced red onion/o oil/vinegar/s&p, then topped this with a slice of mozz. Broiled this until it was bubbly (my stupid oven's broiler is at the bottom, and has one setting: volcanic. I had to check on it every 10 seconds to make sure it didn't burn). I toasted the bun top half, and topped the thing off. The end result was pretty tasty. I think home-grown tomatoes are the key to this recipe's success - I'll make this again next year when I can be arsed to grow my own.

Delicious!  One of my favorites now.  I use plain yogurt instead of mayonnaise, which makes it a little tangy.  I tend to eat it for breakfast; very filling.

Just made this tonight.   I added some powdered garlic to the mayo (really I used Miracle Whip), and since I had no Parmesan, just put feta cheese on top.  Just the flavored spread by itself on the bread was great.  However, all ingredients together made a wonderful treat.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

N.J. produces the best tomatoes in the country and although we prefer to eat these sweet beauties just sliced with a little salt and pepper, our gardens can sometimes overflow and we need to find alternative ways to use them. Kat, this is a simple and fantastic way to do just that. I loved this great little treat and I thank you for submitting it.!

This was delicious! The mayo sauce added a great touch and the vinegar/olive oil mixture on the tomatoes was fantastic. I topped it off with a bit of mozzerella cheese on top before grilling and it was very nice. I'll be making this again.

What a wonderful way to make a tomato sandwich.  I have never marinated them before cooking, this really held the flavor in.  Love the zinged up mayo.  This is a recipie to use again and again.
And with a little fresh herbs, you have a nice salad dressing after you're done.

When I first read this recipe, I found it interesting with directions easy to follow and ingredients commonly found in my kitchen.  After watching me assemble  the hot Tomato sandwiches, my husband quickly volunteered to sample the goods.  We both loved the taste with the tomatoes being soaked in balsamic vinegar. This recipe is going into my file for "repeat often" recipes.

It was a great snack and light dinner for us. I used an Italian cheese blend instead of just Parmesan. And added dried basil in with the others herbs. 2 medium tomatoes or 1 large tomato was sufficient to cover the 4 slices of bread. And we ate it more like toast than a sandwich.

I've made this so many times now, I lost count. Some people in my family prefer it without the tomato. It's also great with a slice of cheese on top of the mayo and cheese sauce.

The recipe calls for 4 ripe tomatoes for 4 slices of bread, so that's way off.  On the other hand, I needed more than 3 tablespoons of mayo for the  mixture to cover 4 slices of bread.  If I make this again, I will salt the tomatoes, rather than add salt to the spread.  Lastly, this is very sloppy to eat unless you use a knife and fork.  I would slice up a baguette for one- or two-bite appetizers.  It is very tasty and worth trying again.

Tried this for lunch today and my wife and I loved it.  Great vegetarian sandwich for some friends of ours.  This is something light and quick that we will serve to friends we invite over for lunch.

Only thing is that I would make about 1/3 more mayo spread that is put on the toast before broiling.  And I needed to increase the Parmesan cheese four fold in order to have enough cheese to suit my wife and I.

I really love recipes that depend on the quality of the ingredients and this is one of them. How simple; how delicious. I added a side of baby bok choy and made it a full meal. A vegetarian fantasy

These were delicious!  I sliced the tomatoes really thick and also put some herbs in the marinade as well.  I added a little mozzarella and shredded fresh basil on top of the bread/ mayo mixture and it was perfect!

*revised* I made this twice. The first time I messed up and accidentally plopped my mayo into the balsamic mix. I spooned the mayo out and just stirred the extra balsamic into the mayo. I didn't have oregano so I used 1 leaf of fresh sweet basil. That was amazing and here was what I originally wrote "Simply amazing. I could see an italian restaurant selling this for $7-10 easily. I had no oregano so I used 1 fresh sweet basil leaf cut up finely and mixed. I also added shredded moz to the mix. WOW add some wine and you have a fabulous easy meal." Now, I did it the way you are supposed to do it by the recipe...and it seemed blah. So, I suggest you add a tiny splash of balsamic to the mayo and fresh basil chopped up rather than oregano to make it amazing. :)

This was absolutely delicious, especially with the tomatoes marinated in balsamic and olive oil.  It was also a super fast and easy dish to make which was great.  Usually I am not a fan of mayonnaise, but this was actually a perfect small amount and with the added herbs and cheese it was great!

4 1/2 stars. We loved the taste but found ourselves pulling the tomato skins off the slices as we ate these yummy sandwiches. Even better with a sprinkling of garlic in the mayo. I must say I was light with the amount of mayo and heavy handed with the Parmesan cheese on top. I like how the mayo melted into the toasted bread like butter when I spread it on, as I am not a huge mayo fan. I shared this recipe with my mom, who managed to serve it to my mayonaise-hating dad without him noticing.
Sept 2016 I make this every fall using field or homegrown tomatoes. It never disappoints and is always a hit in our house.

This was absolutely delicious. My only problem was the tomatoes were very slippery and they tended to slip off the sandwich. But I didn't care. I just scooped what fell back onto the sandwich. The tomatoes were so sweet and flavorful and the mayo added so much. I used plain french bread, toasted, but I think if I had used a thicker bread, it would have been even better.

I have made this many many times. I use San Luis Cracked Wheat Sourdough and home made mayonnaise from a recipe Wesson Oil Co came out with in the 30s. Also like another reviewer stated I used some mozzarella and then topped that with Parmesan and topped it with fresh chopped basil after it came out from under the broiler. On hot summer days this great for dinner.

Flavor-wise, this sandwich is fantastic. It was super easy to make, as I prepared the tomatoes and spread  ahead of time. When my wife came home from work, I was able to make the sandwiches in a matter of minutes with no clean up.

Absolutely amazing sandwich. This is by far my favorite meal to make. It is especially tasty on a thick slice of TOASTED rosemary bread. Make sure you leave it thick to get the softness still on the inside. If I am feeling especially fancy, I like to make it as a flatbread style and reducing my extra balsamic with cornstarch and drizzling it overtop. Enjoy!

I make these for my husband and I all the time.  It's a perfect, delicious lunch.  I make them as is, except sometimes I add mozzarella cheese on top.

These sandwiches tasted like tomato soup in sandwich form.  We used these to use up some tomatoes from the garden and they were excellent.  Will definitely make them again!

Excellent sandwich!I found this recipe about a year ago so I've made it quite a few times all ready, even my 5 and 3 yr. old girls love it. I use mayo made with olive oil, fresh parsley, I double the amount of spices and also double the parm cheese. Soooo good for something made with a few simple ingredents! Thanks Katia for such delicious recipe! Elvira Silva

These are the best! Try different breads and tomato varieties for change in flavor.

I can't get over how wonderful this recipe is. Only thing I do different is I broil it until the cheese is melted on the top(60-90 seconds). 5 minutes is WAY to long!

very tasty!  i agree with other reviews to up the amount of herbs though.  I also add more black pepper for a spicier version.  besides that this recipe has become one of my favorites!  Should change the name to Daughters best broiled tomato sandwich cause my mother has asked me to make this alot!

I love broiling "pizza bread" in the oven - this is a step up definitely.  I added sliced grilled chicken (had some leftovers) and olives and used some leftover french bread.  I love how quick this is and I usually have all these ingredients on hand.  This will definitely get used again.

Really good! Not much beats ripe tomatoes in good olive oil and balsamic. I think fresh herbs would be awesome in this. I used fresh parsely, but only had the dried oregano. I made ours on a small loaf of black pepper French bread and it was delicious. Thanks!

This was just ok. The bread got a bit soggy. Regular grilled cheese is much better and will stick with that.

Excellent sandwich, I made it exactly as written. Balsamic vinegar made it tangy, mayonnaise mix was wonderful. I might try this with checken next time :)

Sooooooooo delicious!!  Tip to some people - my broiler wasn't working (I think the top coil in my oven is busted which would explain a lot, actually) so I toasted the bread so the level I would normally like it, and I microwaved the tomatoes for about two minutes to soften the cheese. (I added cheddar to it, SOOO good!!!) Then I threw the tomatoes onto the dressed toast, and microwaved the sandwich as a whole for about 30-40 seconds.  Probably not as good as broiled, but it was REALLY REALLY good, will make again!

I put slices of motzerlla cheese on top of the tomatoes while broiling.  I think chibata bread is my favorite.  I have also mixed it up with adding a little pesto.

Not bad, kind of like a warm, cheesy BLT. I'd use less vinegar in the marinade, it was overpowering, and about two-thirds as much of the mayo mixture.

Just got done devouring this sandwich, and I must say that it was beyond delicious! So light and refreshing, just what I craved on a hot summer day. Will make again and again and again for sure!

The flavor tries to resembles true italian food but is off and the mayo combined with the marinade and the juice from the tomato was way too squishy for this family. This was after draining  the tomato and reducing the ammount of mayo.  You must really like mayo to like this and not merely regard it as a condiment.

My husband and I both really loved this, such yummy flavours! It was great to be able to taste the flavours of the individual ingredients while also enjoying the delicious blend all together. I marinated the tomatoes in the vinegar and oil for about 7 hours and the flavour was wonderful. Next time I will add more oregano as we like it and it could be more prominent without detracting from anything else. Can't wait to make this again!!

Yummers.  This was so easy, yet so good.  We ran out of parm, so we just grabbed some cheddar from the fridge to fill the remainder of the cheese element.  The only thing is that we still had 3:10 on the timer when the edges began looking super brown, so we pulled out the sandwich.  It seemed to taste really good as is.  I'm not sure if our broiler is hotter than most, but our sandwich was in there for less than 2 minutes.  Regardless, my advice: constantly watch your sandwich to prevent burning.  Will definitely make again.  Except next time, I think I'll try soaking the toast edges in the balsamic vinegar solution first.  Do you think this would help prolong the edges from burning?  We're always looking for tomato recipes, b/c we have this rogue cherry tomato plant that grew over the neighbors wall and is now taking over garden.  The cherry tomato substitution was so tasty.

Hmmm - I must really be missing something. This sandwich was edible, I suppose but  - This tasted like a pickled peppers sandwich. Really, I would have much prefered tasting the actual fresh tomato flavor. The only thing I can think is maybe the tomatoes marinated too long, since I was also making a salad at the same time.

It might just be me but most highly rated recipes I have tried from this site(barring a few exceptions) have turned out to be total duds. However, this one just blew me and everyone at home, away.  This is a regular accompaniment to soup in our house and a lot of the times I use ranch dressing in lieu of the balsamic vinegar with excellent results.  I have even used this as a pizza topping and have literally been praised to the skies.  Bless the poster for the recipe and bless allrecipes for printing it. My soups are so much tastier since I discovered this.

Awesome!  I knew I would love them, bc I make open faced tomato and cheese sandwiches, and when I have leftover bruscetta I often add to my sandwich and toast.  I used a berry balsamic only bc I just remembered it was in the cupboard and wanted to use it up (it's been there for too long!) and used a bit less mayo bc I am not a fan.  I also had wheat bread, so I used that and broiled a bit too long (5 min was a bit much for this bread I guess), but it was still wonderful.  thanks for the recipe!

My husband was very reluctant to try this sandwich, but after one bite he enthusiastically declared it a "keeper!"  What a wonderful accompaniment it was to a creamy soup dinner.  I slightly increased the mayo spread amounts and used thickly sliced homemade (from the local bakery) bread and toasted it well.  We made open faced sandwiches and loved every single bite.  We also added more cheese and made sure it had browned before taking the sandwiches out of the oven.  This sandwich will be a regular family favorite in our house!

WOW!!  This was fantastic!  I used bakery sourdough bread for these and it was a perfect combination of flavor and held up very well.  I added a little salt and cracked pepper to the (fresh garden) tomatoes. I tossed in a little fresh basil and minced garlic to the mayo mixture &  I mixed all of the parm in at once.  I sprinkled a small amount of finely shredded mozz before topping with the tomatoes.   This is my new favorite lunch!!!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Five stars for being a quick easy recipe and three stars for taste.  I thought it was a little bland like it was lacking something.  I think I should of used better parmsean cheese.  I would make this again because I think it would go better with some soup (I ate it on its own).

I love this recipe.  I doubled the parmesan cheese and used an olive bread for more flavor.  I've also used small slices of italian bread for an appetizer.

Great way to use up tomato's! This is pretty tasty. I marinaded my tomato's in a zip lock bag rather than a shallow bowl and served them open faced. Next time I'll probably double the marinade and serve it on the side as extra sauce. I'll be saving this recipe!

I was hesitant to try this recipe because I don't like mayo, but it had great reviews, so I tried it anyway, and it was very good. Something about the spice and mayo combo makes it taste a little like goat cheese to me, which was great. I did salt the tomatoes a little once they were on the bread. I didn't have any trouble with moisture collecting on top of the sandwich. I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent! I didnt have any balsalmic vinegar so I made thes without it and they were still really good. I used a George Forman grill so I didnt heat up the house. Will definately be keeping this recipe! I cant imagine how good it would be with fresh home grown tomatoes. Mmmmmmmm

I thought this sounded so weird, but I was intrigued so I had to try it.  I tell you what, I'm glad I did.  It is so quick, easy, and TASTY after a long day at work.  You will fool yourself into thinking you are a gourmet chef!

Rather than using balsamic vinegar and oil, I just picked up a bottle of balsamic vinaigrette for marinating the tomatoes because it was cheaper to do it that way.

Wonderful!I only made a few changes to mine: I marinated the tomatoes overnight with the marinade plus S&P. In the mayo mixture, I added some garlic powder. Very quick and easy...I'm going to make another for myself in a couple minutes! Highly recommended.
UPDATE 3/16/2015: I've been making this for years, although now I normally don't marinate the tomatoes for more than five minutes. I still add salt and pepper to my marinade. I've used nice Italian breads before and also your standard whole wheat sandwich bread, it's tasty no matter what. Normally, I use an entire tomato per sandwich and just serve it open-faced on two slices.

Awsome sandwich, we use it all the time. Make sure you toast the bread before putting it in the oven otherwise it gets a little soggy.  Our family and friends love this recipe!!!  5 stars!

Delicious. The only modification we made to this recipe was to add about 1/2 garlic salt to the marinade and then added a dash of the marinade to the mayonaisse mixture before spreading on bread and broiling. We used a ciabatta bread/roll split in half lengthwise and served the sandwiches open face.

Thought this was very good. Have made twice now - once exactly as directed, and once by marinating the tomatoes longer and drizzling tomatoes with some of the basamic/olive oil mix before closing the sandwich. I used really firm small plum/grape tomatoes, sliced. I liked the overnight marinated taste better - more flavour and punch, and I found the tomatoes did not get soggy (the regular large size tomatoes probably would). I gave it 4 instead of 5 only because I found the paremsan cheese starts to blacken and burn under the broiler before the sandwich can get "bubbly", as directed and as some other reviewers said. I have to pull them out after only less than a couple of minutes because the cheese is starting to blacken. Maybe next time I will try adding some swiss on top like other reviewers suggested so that the parmesan does not burn so quickly. I also intend to try some time with bacon, since bacon and tomato sandwiches are my all time favourite.

I just made this with fresh picked tomatos from my greenhouse.  I used an artisan bread that had whole garlic cloves in it and made them open faced.  These are delicious!  I'll be making these often and passing this recipe on to others.

Yummy!  I go to a cooking party once a month where everyone brings a dish based on a theme, this month was tomatoes.  I brought this dish.  It was a hit!  I wasn't so sure when I was making it as it didn't look that appetizing, but I was proven wrong.  I was the only one who left with an empty serving dish and I didn't have to change a thing.

I broiled bacon on top of the tomato and added mozzarella but skimmed on the mayo.  I had some left over potato bread in the freezer, so I toasted the bread extra cripsy.  Very good indeed!

Great flavor.  Only problem: The bread caught fire in the broiler.  Not a good thing.  So I will only broil one slice of bread under the tomatoes and then top with a new slice of bread (as another reviewer suggested).  GREAT flavor though, as I said.  A nice, quick meal when you're in the mood for some flavor!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! It's quick to make and delicious every time. The only problem I had was when I broiled the sandwich, the bread would burn and turn hard easily. I keep one slice of bread on the bottom to hold the sandwich and after the tomatoes are broiled, I top it with a freshly toasted piece of bread. Delicious!

These were delicious.  I decided to cook them open faced instead of making sandwiches.  I thinly sliced some french bread, spread the mayonaise spread, added a few tomatos, topped with parmesan cheese and then toasted for a few minutes in the toaster oven.  They were GREAT!

I had to make a quick lunch, and this sandwich was perfect. Done in just 20 minutes, and my family had a tasty treat. Only additions I made was to add garlic powder to the mayo and salt to the tomatoes.

This was a good, easy to make sandwich. For personal tastes, next time I will omit the oil from the tomato marinade, but everything else I will keep as is.  I could imagine you could adjust this to have a different flavor, such as cilantro in the mayo and pepper jack cheese on top.

I basically followed the recipe as it said. But if I were going to make it a second time I probably would top it with different cheeses in addition to the Parmesan (like mozzarella for instance)! I have to follow the others in saying that this was super easy to make (despite the fact that I had to rope my dad in for some help).

This was just ok.  I'd use less balsamic the next time, as it just took away from the taste of the tomatoes.  I sprinkled some garlic powder in the mayo mixture, I think this gave it a good flavor.  I would only broil fo 2 min.  5 min  was too much, it burned the edges.  Hubby did not like this, so I may not make it sgain.

Hubby & I loved it! It's a keeper! I will definitely be making this again & again! I made it on split apart sub rolls. The only modifications I made, was adding some garlic powder to the mayo/herb mixture & I topped them with some shredded mozzerella. Absolutely delicious! Thanks for this recipie!!!

My husband and I really liked this.  I put it on Texas Toast and toasted it beforehand, which is a good thing because it would have gotten soggy otherwise.  I had to double the mayo/parm mixture so it covered the toasts.  I didn't add any salt, but I did put shredded parm and shredded mozzarella on top instead of the grated.  Delicious!  I'll definitely make this again!  Note, it does get a bit oily because of the oil & vinegar marinade.  I may actually cut back a tad on the oil next time.

I am addicted to this! I've made it at least 8 times since fresh home grown tomatoes have come in season. I wouldn't change a thing. I usually just make a BLT, or a tomatoe and mayo sandwich, but this is.....addictive. Gotta have one now!

I do drain the marinated tomatoes on paper towel.

Love this recipe and so did all of my guests!  I have made this twice, the first time as stated in the recipe but the second time I roughly chopped the tomatoes before marinating and drained them before use and I used a sourdough baguette making them an appetizer with wine, a big hit as well!

Very tasty. I used basil instead of parsley in the mayo mixture. And I topped the tomatoes with a slice of provolone in addition to the Parmesan.

This was delicious. I used a red and orange heirloom tomato each for my sandwich. I didn't tweak much of the recipe, though my Parmesan didn't melt or turn golden.  (Nothing like it did in the photo.) I would make it agan and have it with soup.

Delicious. I highly recommend using half the oil and and half the balsamic vinegar. I did use Italian bread.... Even with half the amount of oil and vinegar,  I would recommend increasing the amount of mayo mixture.

Saw the recipe in the magazine and decided to make it. It is totally delicious!  I did not have Italian bread on hand, so used sourdough.  Otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I would say this is a delicious combination of pizza, bruschetta and toasted cheese sandwich. Will definitely make this again.

Why would anyone even suggest adding "MEAT" ? It's a TOMATO sandwich. It was perfect, as is.. As for meat, post your own recipe and just rate this one. Seeing a recipe posted for a review and people making a whole new one by changing it far too often lately. Review this one and post your own.

This is a tasty vegetarian sandwich! I used mozzarella because I only had grated parmesan cheese. I added an Italian seasoning mix instead of just oregano and parsley. And put some crushed red pepper to taste when served.

It was delicious but make sure to start watching the oven after 4 minutes. I caught it at 4.5 minutes and the bread was already brown. 
Also make sure to double the ingredients of the spread or you will run out after only 2.5 slices. Also,I didn’t have olive oil or  balsamic vinegar so I used canola oil & Apple cider vinegar.

I did not make any alterations to the recipe. We enjoyed this one very much and will make again. We found that two large tomatoes (I forget what type of tomato) was more than enough to do the job.

This is such a refreshing and easy meal. I only marinated my tomatoes for about 5 minutes because I wanted to get the meal done quickly with 2 kids complaining of hunger. I also used cooking oil instead of olive oil, but only because I ran out a week ago and haven't gotten around to getting more. It still tasted good. Since my oldest is put off by a tomato sandwich (not a fan of cooked tomatoes), I added some tuna to make it more like a tuna melt. Instead of Parmesan I used mozzarella, again what I had on hand. I added a little parmesan of what I had left. So so good and easy! Watch your toast, about 5 minutes in the broiler and my toast was starting to burn. Very very good.

It was aboustely excellent, loved every bite about it!! The mayo sauce was to die for and the marinate for the tomatoes added a little Italian taste to it. I will use that mayo sauce for putting on my hamburgers!! Will make it again the exact same!! Great light summer lunch.

This is so delicious it shocked me when I took the first bite. My only recommendation would be to use less tomatoes. I used one tomatoes for two slices of bread, which was perfect.

Made as written. Added some Monterey jack cheese to the top as well. 
Very tasty.. I love what the balsamic does to the tomatoes. Can't wait to try this in the summer using flesh herbs from the garden. Next time will try using Greek yogurt instead of mayo. 
Needs salt to finish to make it awesome.

Delicious. The balsamic vinegar makes this recipe. Since its toasted you can use almost any type of bread. I used wheat bread. 

This is not a meal..use it as an appetizer or side carb.

This was 'knock your socks off' good!  I had all these tomatoes ripe from garden, found this recipe, and the rest is history! Being a Pittsburgh girl, I had a half loaf of Mancini ' s Italian bread left from dinner last eve. I wanted to wait and wow my vegetarian boyfriend for dinner, but I'm on graveyard shift and was HUNGRY! I made it as written, except for 1. garlic powder in mayo mixture, and 2. drizzled remainder of olive oil and balsamic over top layer of cheese before broiling. I devoured 4 slices (3 medium tomatoes) for lunch with a glass of cab. Yum, yum, nighty night! I will definitely make  this as long as the garden allows! Also, used freshly grated aged parm. Holy cow, you gotta try this!! Thanks for the recipe, Katia!!!

I followed this recipe to the letter. We ate these as open faced sandwiches so we put tomato slices on each slice of bread. I'm not a huge tomato fan but want to integrate them into my diet so I thought I would give this a try. Go ahead give this one a try it is worth it and you won't regret it. Don't change a thing. UPDATE: I did ‘t have any bread to make these so I used tostados and made these like a pizza. Very good. I think you could use tortillas and cook them as a pizza too. I loke how versatile this topping is.

I wouldn't broil it again, only because it burned my edge of the bread before melting the cheese.

Love this!!! I absolutely love the taste of vinegar unlike my husband who kind of dislikes it. This recipe is a perfect blend to both of our taste buds. This has replaced the garlic bread that I usually serve with spaghetti. I almost forgot he loved it so much that he asked to have it for lunch the other day.  Thank you for sharing this with all of us!!!

We loved it. Modified the recipe just a bit. We didn't have grated Parm so we used crumbled. You don't get the same look, but the taste is the same. I also think the crumbled Parm works better for the spread. Use dense bread or toast your bread a little more than you usually like.

Very quick and very delicious! One of the best tomato sandwiches I have ever tasted. My first try I didn't have the balsamic vinegar so just marinated in olive oil. It was very good but the next time I used both and it was fantastic. I did use sour dough bread and it really added to the taste. Excellent recipe would highly recommend for the tomato lover.

Great recipe!  I added chopped basil and oregano to the marinaade, used only 2 tomotoes and that was enough. Added an equal amount of shredded mozzarella to the cheese mixture.  Doubled the marinade and used the leftover to drizzle over the finished open face sandwiches.

Dee-lish!   I modified a little, used Italian seasonings, pepercinio infused olive oil, and added shredded motzerrella cheese before placing tomatoes on top of toasted, sliced French baggets.

This was a big hit with my family. It was a big hit with me because it was so easy to make! I bought a loaf of uncut french bread from the bakery, cut it in half lengthwise and then into threes. I toasted them under the broiler, and then proceeded as the recipe called for, using the spread only on the top and using fresh tomatoes from our garden. It was a great side to the pork chops and salad that we had for dinner. I know this will be a frequent request in my house!

This recipe was AMAZING!!! I tried it just as written and was greatly impressed with the flavor!!! Next time I'll try a few of the suggestions posted by others like melting a slice of flavored cheese on top and if you wanted to add meat there was a great suggestion for using a few slices of pre-cooked bacon I will be trying for sure. Thanks for submitting!!!

I tryed the recipe and hubby and I both agree that this is one recipe I will never make again. We enjoy the tomatoes while they are fresh in our county and then wait till they come on again the following year. Our county is known in Ontario for their fresh yeild of tomatoes

This was a great side dish!  I didn't use mayo though, I used a green pepper cashew cheese that I made the other day.  Still added oregano, pepper and grated cashew cheese, no parsley though. Very simple and very tasty.

This was so good! I made it for supper tonight and we really enjoyed it. I made one sandwich exactly like the recipe and changed the rest to suit our tastes. I give it five stars just like it is written, but it really became special with bacon and mozzarella cheese added!

Just mix your ingredients in some olive oil and spread it on the toasted bread. The recipe could also use a little "fresh minced garlic", and a little bit of onions.  Adding fresh ingredients when they are in season, gives it the best flavor, ie, basil, oregano.  and definitely Italian Bread.....Mamacheve

For a lighter version, use low-cal whole wheat bread, farmer's cheese, and a lite mayo. I spread the mayo/spice mixture on 2 slices of bread, top with lettuce leaf, set aside. Put a slice of farmer's cheese on the other 2 slices of bread, top with the marinated tomato slices, sprinkle with parmesan, and broil as directed. Top broiled slices with cold slices. Serve with a fruit smoothie or cup of tomato soup. Very yummy, low-cal lunch.

This is an easy and delicious way to use fresh tomatoes in August.  My husband loved this meal and was so disappointed when I told him the tomatoes were gone.  He went to the store to buy more the next day and asked me to make these sandwiches again.  I used a wonderful organic oat bread--perfect texture for this sandwich.  It's a definite keeper

I had seen this numerous times on the reviews and had some Hanover tomatoes I wanted to use, that I bought plenty of at the end of the season. What made me make it was one of the top reviewers saying his wife fell off the couch after her first bite, it was so good. The only changes I made was using lite mayo with olive oil and a lighter parmesan cheese to reduce the saturated fat. I left out the black pepper just because I don't care for it. The one change I do not suggest is using a different vinegar as I did. I would definitely stick with the balsalmic as it is less tart in my opinion. I was surprised that 4 tomatoes were for 2 sandwiches! I ended up just using 2. I could have reduced the vinegrette to for doing that. Overall, it tasted pretty good, but I did find it very messy!

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this, I must have broiled it too close to the top the first time because the exposed parts of bread got burnt to a crisp, I mean, inedible, after three minutes, lol. I served this open faced and the tomato kept trying to slide off the sandwich every time I took a bite, so I might try dicing the tomato in large chunks next time. Loved it! Thanks :D

A little bland, but there was leftover balsamic/oil mix left on the plate after the tomatoes were gone and it was quite tasty after we dipped it in that.

I was wary of this recipe because I don't care much for mayo, but these were WONDERFUL!! Didn't taste "mayo-y" at all to me. I served them on square rolls. We will definitely be having these again!!

Taking the first bite of this brought me back to Italy... (or it would, if I  had ever been there!) Such a great flavour from the herbs and the melted cheese, and marinating the tomatoes made it so much better than I thought! I just used my toaster oven since I was only making for myself this time, but next time I will made for the whole family! I love this recipe since it's so easy both to make and to remember, and it smells amazing!

Wonderful! And if, like me, you like/make homemade wheat bread - yummmy - what a great touch and even heartier.  Agree that marinating tomtoes too long is not good. We love bruschetta and will still treat ourselves to that occasionally, but this is a great lunch or quick summer dinner idea! thanks for sharing!

These were great. I think next time I would cut back the balsamic vinegar just a tad - I couldn't taste tomato, all I could taste was balsamic vinegar. But the Mayo/Parmesan was tasteyyy.

I made the mayo to pair with a BLT.  It was a nice change, but there was a little too much parsley for my preferred taste.

First time I cooked from any recipe on this site (in fact I'm not much of a cook at all) and it came through amazing on first try. I actually did substitute something because I was eager to try the sandwich but didn't have any vinegar. Instead of the vinegar and olive oil, I used italian salad dressing to marinate the tomatoes. I could actually taste a hint of the familiar flavor in the sandwich I would suggest it if you have some in the house. I'll be sure to try it with the olive oil and vinegar next time to compare. Awesome recipe, and a great way for me to start off cooking :)

Wow ... I wasn't sure what this was going to be like but I loved it. My husband wasn't fond of the "tomato sandwich" idea but he absolutely LOVED this. I used more mayo/parmesan cheese, and I also used shredded parm instead. In the mixture I used basil, thyme, pepper, and garlic powder .... put the tomatoes on top of the mayo mixture/bread and topped with salt and shredded parm. VERY YUMMY! We will be trying this as a BLT tomorrow. Very good!

I like this way better with white than with wheat (but I grew up on white bread).  The wheat drowned out the taste of the mayo/parm mix (so much for the hard work!)  The tomatoes were soooo juicy and delicious after the broiling.  The balsamic marinade makes the perfect kick.  I did sprinkle some salt on top and I had felt like it was lacking a little before, so I added some feta on top this last time, and I think that is they key.  I am addicted now!  Also, toasting the bread first is also key, otherwise the heavy open faced sandwich will never hold up!

These came out better than expected! My family raved about them! Minor changes: while marinading the tomatoes I added a couple of cloves of garlic as well as salt and pepper. I topped the sandwiches off with fresh basil...very good! Easy!

Family really likes and it's pretty quick and easy. With 3 in our family, I can broil in toaster oven which heats up house less than full oven in the summer. Did find that its helpful to let the marinated tomatoes drain a bit before putting onto the sandwich, otherwise it makes it a bit too moist & messy. Very tasty!

Superb!!!!! I didn't use real slice parm cheese. So it didn't melt. I just used the shakable stuff and it was still really good. Will use meltable parm cheese next time.

Has potential but is just too mayonnaise-ey and needs less balsamic vinegar, IMO. Also I suggest using black bread.

Yum, yum, YUM!  I didn't marinate the tomato slices - it seemed like such a shame to hide their flavor under a vinegar and oil blanket.  The mayo is to die for - you still taste the tomato, but it is... just yum.  Hubby loved too.

I don't even care for tomatoes and I loved this recipe.  The tomatoes soften while marinating.  We made the sandwiches like grilled cheese (pan fry) instead of broiling.  Yummy!!!

This was AMAZING! So simple to make, and delicious! I had some extra tomato slices, so I threw in some cucumber pieces while the sandwich broiled, and had a really good side dish to go with it. This is definately something I'm going to make over and over again!

I make this sandwich often since I'm pregnant and craving tomato sandwiches.  Sometimes I'm too lazy to marinate the tomatoes and it still tastes great!  Also I only use good shredded parm, not that powdery stuff.

The brief marinade of the tomatoes really adds to the flavor and juiciness, but toasting the bread prior to  broiling keeps it from absorbing too much juice.  I used Roma tomatoes from the grocery store (actually quite good for winter tomatoes) and thick potato bread.  I will definitely make this again with garden-ripe tomatoes.

This was amazing...I never thought I would say that about a tomato sandwich.  I did make a small change, I used 2 tsp parmesan cheese and I added a little sharp cheddar to the top of each tomato.  I made this for my kids for dinner and ordered out for my husband and I...we ended up putting the take out in the fridge and making these delicious sandwiches for ourselves too!  My husband asked if we could have it again tonight!  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!

This was okay but not great. It sounded better than it tasted. I love tomato sandwiches, but I suppose I liked this one less because the tomatoes were warm. The taste of the ingredients was not particularly memorable.

Painfully simple, but deli / bread company / restaurant quality. Add deli meat and/or sliced cheese for more interest. I wholeheartedly recommend using fresh potuguese rolls as the bread. I also added a sprinkling of onion powder to the mayo mixture. I served this with cream of pumpkin soup on a chilly fall day and it was phenomenal. Looks beautiful too, and tastes like it was a lot more difficult to make. A+ ... you've gotta try this!

Mama knows best!  :)  My husband asked that I please make these regularly.  Delicious and so easy!  Made them on English Muffins because I had a lot and it was the only bread in the house.  Also added a 1/2 slice of Provolone cheese.    Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I did not marinate the tomatoes. I just thought it would be too much moisture. I substituted fresh basil for the seasonings in the mayo. I spread the mixture on toast and broiled it. Then topped it with fresh tomato slices. Yum!

This was pretty good, but a little strong. I liked it better with half the balsamic vinegar, and swiss made a good substitute for parmesean - since its cheaper, at least where I shop.

We prefer sour dough toast for a tastier and heartier bread. After toasting, rub on a fresh clove of garlic, add everything else, and top with some sliced fresh basil (makes a world of difference). In America we call it an open faced sandwich, the French call it a Tartine (tar-teen), are excellent and a way to cut down on eating bread. Once I learned about making toasted Tartine sandwiches, I never went back to making a double-toasted or un-toasted sandwich again. Plus, I lost some weight too!

My boyfriend detests tomatoes, but he LOVES this tomato sandwich! He was reluctant at first, knowing that I was trying to stuff him with tomatoes, but I did force him to try, and was he surprised! I brushed the breads before toasting them with the leftover dressing from the "Portobello Sandwich" recipe from this website. He liked the sandwich so much he kept asking for second bites (he was driving). Though he tried to reason with me that the this would tastes better with meat and how he disapproved the tangy taste of the tomato slices, I knew from his eyes he was lying! He just couldn't cope with the fact that he eventually likes tomatoes!

This sandwich is fabulous with ripe, summer tomatoes.  Since I first made it months ago, my husband requests it at least once a week!  I do make it open faced and put it right up to the broiler to make the cheese golden brown.  I also put in a lot more garlic; because we love garlic!  Great recipe!

I did not care for this. It came out of the oven looking so good but it tasted so fatty and creamy. I guess I should have known it wouldnt be good though, its basicly 4 tablespoons of fat with cheese. 
I ended up taking everything off except the tomatoes.

What a delicious way to use vine ripened tomatoes this time of year!  I added slices of red onion to the sandwich but other than that, I followed the recipe.  My husband LOVED them and so did I.  This will become a regular dinner for us this Spring and Summer!

Very, very yummy! Tip: Cover the entire slab of bread with the mayo mixture, otherwise the bread will burn in the places not covered.

I thought his sandwich was delicious.  I didn't measure out the ingredients for the spread, but I probably added a pinch more than the recipe called for.  Great for a light lunch or dinner.

Absolutely perfect sandwich. I served it with sweet pea soup. The only thing that could have improved it was if I had some better balsamic vinegar. Try this!

WOW! Who knew such a simple sandwich could be so delicious!  It took me less than 5 min. to make and less than 5 min. to eat.  I gobbled it up so fast I didn't even realize until I was done that I was still standing next to the oven...lol.  I followed the recipe exactly expect for the olive oil, I omitted that step.  Mmmmm I'll be making this one alot!

We enjoyed these!  The only change we made was to broil them open face and eat with knife and fork.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is so delicious!  I make it all the time in the toaster oven now.  The time I made it with Garlic Foccacia was definitely the best :)  Thanks for the new recipe.

A really yummy sandwich. Be sure to serve it right away, or the cheese hardens.

Very quick and easy.  I love olive oil and balsamic vinegar so I thought it was great; my grandma and daughter thought it was just okay.  I used a little less mayonnaise than was called for, which I think was the problem for my grandma.  I wish there was a good substitute for the mayonnaise, then it would be a 5 star for sure!

Phenominal..doesn't look like too much but tastes wonderful. I used 2tblsp. light mayo, added ~1 - 1.5 tsp. italian seasoning instead of parsley, added a crushed garlic clove to the mayo mix, pepper and parm. cheese. Didnt have mozz. cheese so sprinkled tomatoes with parm. cheese right  before broiling in toaster over and yummy. Made it on marble seedless rye bread (all I had)Thanks for sharing this one..loved it!!

This was an easy recipe that yielded great results.  I enjoy vegetarian sandwiches, and with this one the combination of flavors was new and interesting.  I used the remaining tomato marinade as dressing on the salad that I made to go with the sandwich.

I used a whole wheat hamburger bun, low fat mayo, low fat mozz chz (instead of parm...it is all I had), and for the herbs, basil, parsley, and paprika. I also omitted the olive oil from the tomatoes. This is good, plain and simple.

I made this on a cheese bread and it was delicious. I do put a really small rack or turkey drip dray under it though in case my tomatoes are too juicy. It's not as good with soggy bread.

This was good.  I only used 2 tomatoes and it was still enough to cover all 4 slices of bread.  I'm not sure what kind of huge bread you'd have to use to fit 2 tomatoes on each slice!  I really enjoyed the taste of the balsamic vinegar.  Very nice!

I didn't have parsley, so I skipped it. I used homemade basil mayonnaise, and Cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan. I didn't think something so simple could be so delicious, but it was!

So this kicked up tomato sandwich is good but I would not say spectacular.  I make toasted tomato sandwiches all summer long, spreading mayo on toasted bread and adding sliced tomatoes toped with salt and pepper.  This version is fancier and tastier. Very good.

Very Very good!  I was waiting till my husband was out at hockey (he doesn't like tomatoes) so I used 2 slices of 7 grain bread and only 1 tomato, which worked out well.  Absolutely fabulous,  healthy and FAST to make! Thanks!

This was way better than I expected.  I used garlic powder with the mayo as we are not oregano fans.  Quite tasty and really simple to fix.  Sliced the tomato fairly thick.  They seemed to hold up well.  Thanks.

Awesome. I used an unsliced artisan grain bread and after slicing, toasted it til golden under the broiler.  I marinated the tomatoes (used half the oil)for about a half hour which was too much and they got a bit soggy, so next time I'll cut it back to 10-15 minutes.  I used Kraft Parmesan in the mayo and fresh grated asiago on top.  It will now become a staple.

I did not like the sandwhich. I think the vinegar runied it. I gave it 3 stars because the mayo was awseome. I can't wait to try the mayo on something better.

This is a yummy, quick and easy recipe.  I used whole wheat bread and half light mayo.  I also cut the marinade mix in half, because I used 2 tomatoes (I just didn't see how 4 tomatoes would fit on 4 slices of bread).  Broiled it on "low" (my broiler has a High and Low setting) so it didn't cook too fast.  Had a bowl of tomato soup on the side.

Delicious! I have made this twice now and the second time omitted the olive oil all together to make it less oily. I also added garlic salt to the mayo mixture and used Sargento brand mozzarella and asiago blend cheese instead of what the original recipe called for. One other change was that I broiled it on whole wheat pita bread. Definitly a new favorite of mine!

Let me start by saying that I am NOT a tomato lover, but I've got them coming out of my ears this time of year.  I thought this would be a good way to use up some of them.  These sandwiches were great!  I even ate some of my toddler's that he wasn't going to finish!  This recipe will be a frequent one in our lunch menu.  The only thing I changed was adding some sliced mozzarella on top of the tomatoes to boost up the protein content.

I made this for the first time last weekend, using bakery bagels instead of the bread called for, and used Original Flavor Mrs. Dash in the mayo. Also, we used sliced mozzerella flavored soy cheese. I toasted the bottoms first, then layered the mayo, tomato, and soy cheese (my husband's had some sliced avocado too), broiled this for approximately 5 mins. until the cheese browned, then put the tops (also toasted) after they came out. I enjoyed it, but my husband ABSOLUTELY RAVED about this! In fact, we are having this again tonight and will be adding some fresh basil this time!

YUMMY!  It was very easy and quick to make.  When I first try a new recipe, I just follow exactly what it says and ended up making for 10 other people whom I don’t have (I live alone).  This was perfect and so delicious, I was able to finish it by myself.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good.  My husband looked at me strangely when I told him we were having "tomato sandwiches" for dinner, but even he was delighted with the results.

I liked this sandwich, and my boyfriend loved it! I am a huge fan of balsamic vinegar, and I have been known to eat plain tomatoes drenched in it. The tangy mayo mixture has an AMAZING flavor! The problems I had were this: a)I used a 7 grain bread, and the single sliced blackened on the edges and the bread ended up being too crunchy b) the bread under the tomatoes got soggy (maybe I used too much balsamic? After reading the reviews I've picked up some tips and will try it different ways. Great summer recipe!

This was really REALLY delicious. I seeded and diced the tomatoes instead of slicing them and cut the marinade and mayo mixtures in half, simply to reduce calories from fat. I topped my sandwiches with lite swiss instead of more parmesan. Yummy! I think that individual herbs could be changed around to whatever you have on hand or you desire, and to make it even simpler a good herb blend would work nicely as a substitution.

I love sandwiches for breakfast instead of a plate of eggs....this tomato sandwich makes a great dish for any meal, but as a good and nutritious breakfast this was truly manna from heaven. Next time we have company I will make this recipe on small baguette slices for appetizer. I can't wait for the tomatoes in my garden to start cropping...fresh garden tomatoes will elevate this recipe to culinary nirvana. (That would be 6 stars +)

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Easy and fast.  I didn't use as much tomato - I found that 2 was enough. Plus I used more cheese.  Why not, right?

This was fantastic! I highly recommend it if you love tomatoes or not.  I can't stop eating them. I make them for lunch and for dinner! I made them for my parents and they loved them too. I will make this recipe from here on out! Thank You.

This is a perfect way to use garden-fresh tomatoes.  We used fresh french bread and it was delicious!
