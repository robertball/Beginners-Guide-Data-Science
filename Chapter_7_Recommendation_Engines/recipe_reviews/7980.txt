OMG this was really good! I used almond extract because I couldn't find pecan liqueur, so it kinda turned into and Almond Pecan cheesecake, but it was still awesome. I liked it so much with the almond that I've made it twice and I'm not worried about ever finding pecan liqueur.

Good but too much liqueur, it tasted too strongly of just the liqueur and not the cheesecake.

This needs to be baked 2-3 days in advance to let the liquer flavor mellow out.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was good, but I just had to make a few changes the second time around.  To make it easier, I used the ground pecan/graham cracker topping to make the crust, and left out the toppings and simply drizzled with caramel.  People raved about it both ways, so you really can't go wrong.

this was a great cheesecake, but i had to substitute frangelico liquor for the pecan liquor. It was impossible to find pecan liquor in Massachussets.

I MADE THIS FOR THE GIRLS IN MY OFFICE AND THEY ALL RAVED ABOUT IT. I MADE SOME SIMPLE CHANGES AS I USED FRANGELICA AND CUT IT TO 3 OUNCES AS SOME OF THE REVIEWS STATED. WILL MAKE THIS THIS AGAIN WITH MAYBE A TWIST! FOLLOW THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN, COOKING TIME IS PERFECT IF YOU USE A 10 INCH SPRING FOAN PAN. THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP TO ALL THE REVIEWERS. MY CHEESECAKE DIN NOT CRACK AT ALL, IT IS ALL IN THE COOING IN THE OVEN.

This was an OK cheesecake.  I have made and had much better.  The cake didn't have a lot of flavor, it was actually to fluffy to me.  I did have to cook it about 15 minutes extra because the center didn't firm up.  So I don't know if my sides were overcooked because there was no way I was going to get anything to stick without smearing the topping on the sides.  (I just put it on the top and it still looked impressive).

This is one of the best cheesecakes I've had. I couldn't find the pecan liquor but I had a white chocolate liquor so I substituted that and a little almond extract. It was delicious and beautiful.

“Better then excellent!” This cheesecake turns out amazingly rich and creamy. I added a little more pecan liqueur to the topping and half cup of whipping cream and made it more of a whipped topping.

Make sure to line the bottom of the pan with parchment or wax paper. It will stick to the pan no matter how hard you try if you don’t!! Delicious!!
