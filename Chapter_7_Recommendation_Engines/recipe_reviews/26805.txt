This recipe needed a lot of tweaking!  It contains way too much flour.  I did get a good idea from the base of the recipe.  I used Rotel tomatoes, not drained, and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also added some garlic powder and cumin.  Then used 1/2 Monterey Jack cheese and 1/2 sharp cheddar along with an additional can of green chili peppers.  Keep on low heat and do not allow to boil.

I found this dip to be very bland & pastey.I had added chili powder & garlic after tasting it but it still had a weird thick pastey texture.Maybe it would be better with salsa mixed into it but I wouldn't waste the ingredients to try it again.

I Really Didn't think This Recipe Was Bad (And Everyone I Work With LOVED It), But I Used It More As A Guideline.  I Doubled The Tomatoes, Chilies, & Corn.  I Only Used About A TBL Of Flour Too.  Also Added Some Oregano & Cayanne Pepper In The First Step.  Next Time I Think I'll Try Using Salsa... It'll Probably Be More Like Salsa Con Queso Then.

This recipe needs a lot of help. I used fresh roma tomatoes since the recipe did not specify canned or not. I also used fresh hatch green chili also, that I sauteed until skin started to brown. I then added tomatoes and corn. I increased corn to 1/2 cup. I then used 1 cup milk (I did start at 1/4 cup but it was pasty and added more to get a good consistency) to 1/4 cup flour and cooked until thickened and then added 8oz cheese. If you like things extra cheezy add the other 8oz. I then tasted the dip and it was pretty bland so I added, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and fresh ground pepper. Fresh cilantro would be a good addition also.
