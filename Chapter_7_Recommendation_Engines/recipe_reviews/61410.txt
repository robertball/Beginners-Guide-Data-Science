First, let me say how annoying it is to me to read reviews that give a poor rating when the reviewer doesn't follow the recipe! I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and this is without a doubt one of the most heavenly chocolate cheesecakes I've ever made.  Just remember, the crust calls for chocolate cookies crumbs--not OREO cookie crumbs. So the butter to crumb ratio is just fine. I used chocolate graham cookie crumbs.  It is very important to not leave out the heavy cream when melting the chocolate. The cream makes the chocolate into a nice, thick ganache. Eliminating the cream would result in a much thinner batter. My batter before cooking was a bit thinner than some cheesecakes I've made, but not significantly so. I was expecting it to be more runny based upon reviews that I had read.  I did cook it for about 5 minutes longer because my oven runs a little cooler. The recommendation to wrap the pan in foil before submerging it in water was key--if you've never done a submerged waterbath and didn't know to wrap the pan, I can see where that would cause poor results. I took this to a St. Patrick's Day party and everyone went nuts--it was completely devoured! I'll be making this again, for sure.

I've been a member for 2 years and this is my first review.  Although I've enjoyed many, many other recipes I've gotten from Allrecipes the reason I'm reviewing this is to counteract some of the negative reviews!  This is absolutely delicious made as the recipe is written!  I agree with those who say people shouldn't change the recipe and then complain because it isn't to their liking!  Make it as the recipe is written and then make changes IF necessary!  Changes are not necessary for this recipe - I made it 2 weeks AS WRITTEN - it was to die for!  I'm making it again this weekend AS WRITTEN! I use a spring form pan, oreo cookies which I take apart and discard the white stuff, Guinness beer, and place a pan of water on the shelf under the cheesecake.  The only thing I do differently is to make a ganache from Ghirardelli 60% chocolate and heavy cream --and that is not a change, it's an addition!  Please try this as written! And if you make it with all sorts of changes and don't like the result, keep your opinions to yourself!  And I also take offense to the reviewer referring to the Holy Mother for a recipe review!!  No wonder your recipe didn't turn out!  Sorry to be so vocal but to criticize someone who is willing to share a recipe is beyond my comprehension.  Life is short - let's be kind to each other!

For the love of God & the Holy Mother, drink the Guinness while you're looking for a DIFFERENT recipe.  Seriously.  This one is horrible.  I cook cheesecakes all the time.  (DH loves cheesecake almost as much as Guinness.)  So I should have trusted my instincts on this one & skipped the beer as the recipe was already too loose.  The person even got the crust part wrong: cookie crusts need 2 cups crumbs, 2 TB butter (hello, the stuff in the middle is already fat & sweet & chocolate); graham cracker crusts need 1-1/2 cups crumbs, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar.  Too much butter leaves cookie crusts tasting like lard & cracker crusts hard.  It's not necessary to reinvent the wheel just because you're going to post your recipe.  No idea what the 1/4 tsp cocoa was for...I've never seen 1/4 tsp of anything called for in a recipe.  Why bother? The eggs, sour cream, cream cheese is all a normal cheesecake recipe...so, it's either the 3/4 cup beer puts the liquidity over the top or its the water bath cooking method.  (I didn't immerse my springform by the way, a pan of water underneath in an oven would be sufficient in a recipe that NEEDS moisture, UNLIKE this one.)  Finally, 90 minutes on 350, I take it out as the perimeter is starting to pull & crust, center looks iffy.  (Left in the oven, turned off, door ajar for another hour.) & oh surprise, surprise crust is soggy, cake completely raw.  I'm so mad at myself because I fell for all the hocus pocus thinking it might be interesting b

I've made this cheesecake twice, both times with stellar results. The first time I didn't make any changes to the ingredients, and followed the instructions to the letter. It was exceedingly good. The texture was silky and crack free, the flavor was a mature chocolate with subtle stout undertones. (NOTE: When I was pouring the batter into my springform, I was nervous because it seemed too thin to set. It wasn't! Actually, I think that's why it was so silky smooth.) The second time I made the recipe, I added an extra 1/4 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder to the crust, and instead of Guinness I subbed Young's Double Chocolate Stout (a heady English Stout in a purple bottle/can that can be found in the Microbrew section of most liquor stores). What a winner! The extra cocoa powder and the Young's achieved the complex bittersweet flavor I had been looking for. This is a Five Star recipe with no changes, and (in my opinion)MORE than five with heavier stout.

Very tasty!  With a family of beer drinkers, this was a hit.  Suggestion to those who had a problem with "wet"-always use the best quality sour cream and cream cheese.  Off brands can affect your results.  Have eggs, cream cheese, butter and sour cream at room temperature before starting.  Always drain excess moisture from your sour cream by placing in a fine sieve or yogurt strainer over a bowl while letting it warm .  These little hints can make a huge difference in the end result!

I came across this recipe while browsing for a fun new cheesecake recipe to make for Valentine's day.  My husband loves Guinness, so I knew I had to try it.  I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, but we both LOVED it!!  So delicious and not too difficult to make.  I didn't have a springform pan, so I used a regular pan, and after the cheesecake cooled, I flipped it onto a piece of parchment paper, and then back to a regular plate.  I made chocolate hearts instead of clovers (because of Valentine's day)- so the presentation was *almost* as wonderful as the taste. 
I admit, at first I thought it'd be weird to try beer in cheesecake, but I'm so glad I did!!

I used crushed chocolate graham crackers, which I increased to 1 1/2 cups, and I used 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa for the crust, not 1/4 teaspoon. I used Ghiradelli 60% cocoa chocolate chips. I also cooked at 325 for about 70 min., then let sit in oven with the door cracked for another hour. Instead of a water bath, I just put a tray of water underneath the cheesecake. After all that, this was the most decadent chocolate cheesecake I have had for some time. It was picture perfect, and had such a wonderfully rich dark chocolate flavor, I was showered with compliments!

I love Guinness so I was really excited about this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly but after waiting forever for the cheesecake to be ready, it was completely raw inside.  I am really upset that this recipe didn't work because I really wanted to try it, but I would have no idea how much longer to bake it for. I think it might have something to do with altitude? Who knows, I don't know what else might have went wrong.

Absolutely fabulous!!  Kudos to the creator of this recipe!  I used a chocolate stout beer and the ghiradelli chocolate chips and after much research...I have all my ingredients at room temperature.  The key is to add everything a bit at a time..One egg at  time, bit of sugar at a time...pause every so often and scrape the sides of your bowl down!  I also LOVE the water bath.  I use the extra long Reynolds aluminum foil and wrap my spring pan twice so that NO water is able to make it into the pan and then put my spring form pan into the pan i usually roast my turkey in!. I baked mine about 15 minutes longer...but still kept it in the oven as recommended.  As for the chocolate clovers?  I put the melted chocolate into my kids medicine dropper and it worked very, very well!!  Will make this again and again!!  No cracks baby!!

I modified this recipe a little bit. I took the advice of the other reviewers. First of all I dont have a spring form pan, so I made my crust in a pan first. And taking into concideration the fact that people said the crust wouldnt cook properly with that amount of butter/cookie ratio I used slightly less butter then called for. I cooked the crust in the pan for about 15 min on 350. I also made the cheese cake filling without sour cream. This happened to be an accident. I had extra cheese cake filling left over after pouring the first pan, so I went ahead and made a second crust. The first cheesecake I put into the oven I did not put a pan of water underneath it. I cooked it for 60 min on 350. Then turned off the heat for 30 min with the door closed. And then 15 more min with the door open. Then I put in the refrigerator for 4 hours. The first cheesecake turned out dry and cracked on top, but the texture and taste turned out just fine. So the 2nd cake I put a pan of water underneath and cooked the same amount of time. This cake turned out very pretty and not cracked. As far as this cheese cake goes, the cooking time and texture turned out great. It wasnt soggy or undercooked or over-wet at all. I dont think its the best cheese cake I've ever had or made. It does have a wonderful hint of the beer flavor that makes it different. I think its a nice manly cheesecake!

I think the people who gave this a bad review must have done something wrong.  Really, this was the best cheesecake EVER!  My husband loves chocolate and Guinness, and he found this recipe for me.  I was skeptical because he doesn't ever cook, and I read a few of the bad reviews, and almost said no, but he insisted I try.  I followed the recipe to the letter, with the only exception that I let it cook 60 minutes, and let it sit an extra 45 minutes in the closed oven.  Turned out FANTASTIC!  Beautiful appearance, perfect texture, and chocolaty goodness with a very slight hint of Guinness.  The batter did appear very runny, and I was scared, but have no fear, it came out perfect!

Made this for myself and my husband (a guiness fanatic) and we loved it.  He is a big guiness drinker and he says he will never have his guiness another way.  While I don't believe that, it is really good.  This was my first time making a cheesecake and I made a couple of errors but it still turned out great.  I forgot to put the pan of water in around it, it took an extra 20 min to cook but did turn out well.

So I just made this cake, I found it took a really long time to bake, but my oven isn't the best either, and I also found it rose up a lot. If I hadn't of lined my cake pan with parchment paper it would have overflowed. I figure it rose up due to the yeast in the beer but I could be wrong about that. I haven't eaten the actual cake yet, it's for a St Patricks day party tomorrow, but the batter was heavenly. I just hope the cake tastes just as good.

Due to others' bad reviews because they didn't follow the recipe exactly, I made sure to follow it exactly.  Well, I tried to.  I had to use Oreos for the crust instead of chocolate cookies since the store didn't have chocolate cookies, so then I used half the sugar for the crust to account for the creamy sugary centers.  I also used half-n-half instead of heavy cream because I could not justify buying it for just 2 T.  BUT the cake came out fantastically!  I made it for my hubby's 40th birthday, and he had two big fat pieces.  The other party attenders gobbled it up, raving about how good it was.  The texture was very creamy, wonderfully chocolaty, and the top came out looking like a professional cheesecake.  I will make this again and again and again!!  Just be sure to follow the directions exactly and also note what the directions don't say:  wrap the springform pan in foil very well to keep the cake dry from the water bath.  ENJOY!

I cooked it in a water bath for longer than stated in the recipe. It turned out delicious! I also melted semi-sweeted choc with a TEENY bit of coconut oil (so it doesn't get crack-you-tooth-hard when it is refrigerated) and drizzled it over the top. SUPER YUMMY!!

A friend found this recipe and asked me to make it so she could try it. I now have a LOT of friends who are constantly asking when I'm going to make it again. A fantastic recipe!!!! One of the best cheesecakes I've ever had (and the only one I ever make). I don't do the garnishes, just the cheesecake itself and I use store bought crust, but it is amazing.

Followed the directions to a T and it was delicious! The cheesecake was a little less dense than my  standard recipe. Texture was similar to a mousse.

Was a big hit this St Patty's day!   some changes i made - left out the heavy cream,  used 1 1/2 c crushed chocolate graham cracker instead of 1 c, and used 6 T butter for the crust.  I didn't have cocoa powder either.   It came out fantastic!!!   I used a 9x13 pan with aluminum foil on the bottom to take it out easier.  I cut it into squares for a party with about 30 people.    I also put a baking sheet with water on the rack below as suggested by other reviewers.

I have made this according to the recipe EXACTLY at least 5 times. The flavor is outstanding: slightly bitter but sweet. The texture is dense and creamy in a "melt-in-your-mouth" kind of way.  My husband requested it for his birthday cake and one friend even paid me to make it for him. I don't really understand all of the negative reviews. This is one of my all time favorite cheesecakes!  ***Only gave 4 stars because you really should wrap the bottom of your springform in foil to protect from the water bath.

I made this *almost* exactly per recipe.    Fist off it turned out DELICIOUS.  I had a lot of the same fears as other reviewers - the batter seemed too runny, it didn't appear fully cooked after 45-50 min with the oven door closed, etc.  But it ended up setting beautifully and had a wonderful silky texture.  
I'm only giving four stars though because the one change I made was reducing the butter in the crust.  I made it with about 3 tablespoons instead of a quarter cup.  Next time I'm going to try with closer to two because the butter leaked all over the bottom of the pan and the crust did not set up nice and crunchy.  
I topped the cheesecake with a ganache after it sat in the fridge overnight and took it to Thanksgiving dinner.
Everyone LOVED it and raved!  It really was delicious and I will definitely make it again... just hope I can get the crust right next time.

It was like mousse and extremely delicious.  A keeper recipe.  The recipe is fantastic. Rarely do I follow a recipe exactly or measure anything.  I usually wing it all with great success but, I did follow this to the letter (minus a few sips of Guinness) and it was perfect.

This is the second cheesecake I have ever made in my life. The first was plain and delicious but this cake... My gawd was simply amazing. I picked this recipe because my husband and I drink Guinness a lot and when his 31st birthday came up I thought it would be perfect and it was. Irish for the Irish. I followed it to the last letter. I was leery because we live at about 10,000 feet. I'm still learning about elevation and cooking. This cake came out smooth, creamy, amazingly delicious but firm enough to set. The only thing I would like to learn more about is the crust and it's consistency. Consistency aside...wouldn't change a thing and neither would anyone else that partook. Incredible. Don't mess with it and don't try new recipes if you apparently know enough to make your own. Good eats:)

I've made this cheesecake three times now and it is amazing! I've gotten so many compliments for it, everyone loves it! I followed the recipe exactly each time. It's incredibly rich and smooth. The center is sometimes a bit loose, but that could be because my oven isn't the greatest. It isn't too loose, though, and it certainly doesn't take away from the taste. Thank you for posting this recipe. I will most definitely continue to make this wonderful dessert. :)

I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfectly!  I used generic Oreos for the crust and separated the cookie from the cream filling and only used the cookies for the crust.  My only word of caution is to be sure that the cream cheese is very soft before adding to mixer.  Otherwise you get cream cheese lumps in your cake- not the worst outcome, but not overly pretty.

This was delicious. I didn't use the cookie crust or decorate it so I'm just rating the cake. The texture was a little too moist/airy for my preference but it held together well and I got nothing but compliments.  My batter was not as runny as some experienced, but the cake was quite jiggly after the recommended time, puffed up to double it's final size while cooking and then fell in.  I'm not sure if it was the beer, using the mixer, or the egg(I usually use less than a recipe calls for due to allergies). I will definitely use this recipe again but I will reduce the eggs and hand mix the batter as I normally do. Thanks for the yummy dessert.

This recipe has SUCH potential - if perfected, it could be one of those "signature" dishes that all of us are looking for, the kind of thing that people ask you to bring by name when they are having a party.  Unfortunately, I did have some problems with this one.  Let me say that the flavor of this cheesecake is absolutely phenomenal - chocolate cheesecake is to die for anyway, but the Guinness adds a little bitter undertone that brings it to another level.  Amazing.  And after making the little chocolate shamrocks (for a St. Patty's Day party), the presentation was unbeatable - people asked if I had stopped at a bakery on my way! :D  The problem with this cake is the liquidity of the batter - it looked very wet for a cheesecake batter when I poured it in the pan, and I baked it just as written.  At the end of the 90 minutes, the cake still rippled in the center.  Put it back in the oven for another 30 minutes at 350.  When it was time to eat the cheesecake, it was cooked through but barely, a little more goopy in the middle than I would have hoped.  I will definitely try this one again, but the consistency of it as written knocks it down a few stars.

This was a fun recipe to make. My husband and I tried out our brand new Kitchen Aid mixer on this. We made two cheesecakes. He took one cake to work and we kept one for us at the house. The first one didn't cook all the way in the water bath and it was a really fluffy texture. So for the second one we didn't do the water bath and cooked it for about 15 minutes longer with the door open slightly. It turned out wonderfully. My husband's co-workers ate all of it and several wanted the recipe. It was just really rich and thick. Delicious!!

only 4 stars cuz the temp should be 375 and the time should be 1.5 hrs.  Other than that this is an amazing cheese(more like Mouse) cake.  
Just a suggestion, I used a chocolate stout instead of Guinness and I'm sooo happy I did.

This cheesecake is excellent!  I will definitely make it again.  I couldn't figure out how to do the shamrocks so I just drizzled the chocolate over each piece.

Amazing!  This is the best cheesecake I've ever made.  I don't have the special pan - I used an oreo crust in a tin pan and filled a big baking dish halfway with water and followed the same directions.  I think I took it out maybe 20-25 minutes into leaving it in the off/open oven, but I don't think that mattered much.  This made enough for me to do 2 cheesecakes in that manner.

Wow! So smooth and creamy and great flavor. Wonderful dessert. Used Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers (in ice cream topping section of grocery). Perfect! Made it for a double birthday: daughter who loves chocolate & cheesecake and her husband who loves Guinness. Not like a typical cheesecake, almost like a cheesecake-mousse hybrid. Didn't know to wrap the pan in foil before baking in the water bath so crust was a little bit soggy but my pan has a decent seal so wasn't bad. Will know next time to use the foil. Didn't look done so baked an extra 10 minutes. Was suspicious that a cheesecake can be done in only 45 minutes! Left in oven, as directed and as I know to do for cheescake. Came out perfect after chilling. Worth the time to make. A definite keeper recipe that will be made again - for my own birthday.

As many people seem to have made this very touchy recipe with good results, I'm sure the problem is just in the way it was written. I'm a pretty experienced cook and was very excited to learn of this water-bath method, certain it would produce an amazingly smooth cheesecake. But it would be very helpful for the submitter to offer hints as to how much water is needed to cook the cake adequately, and how much heat should be allowed to escape with the door slightly ajar. I followed this recipe exactly as written, along with the recommendation that I wrap the springform pan in foil. (As the latter was not even included in the original recipe, I suppose I was not as diligent as I should have been with this step--some water still managed to seep around.) As there are no hints given, I had to wait until the end of the 1 1/2 hour cooking time to know that I needed to make some adjustments. Please let us know what to watch for to make sure it turns out right!

This is fantastic!  I love how the Guinness cuts the sweet of the chocolate.  I made it and brought some to work in March, and now, in January co-workers are STILL talking about it!

Made this for St.Patrick Day I read reviews so I cooked it longer 60 min total, left in oven chilled I did make one change I added espresso powder to crust 1/2t because I find it gives the chocolate a richer flavor, took to dinner party everyone raved and wanted recipe. Will make again! Rich and delicious!

This is easily 5 stars and the people who rated 1 star almost scared me away from it! I used chocolate graham crackers for the "chocolate cookies" (What could that mean???) and I put a pan of water on the lower shelf. Water baths intimidate me. Also, I made this for my Guinness-loving husband and his anti-alcohol family. Everybody loved it.

I made this the other day exactly like it says in the original recipe although I don't like the cookie crust so I decided to change it up a little and make brownies and then press it down into the springform pan. It was so good!! Everone loved it, the texture is not like new york style cheesecake and maybe that's what ppl are expecting

This was a good cheesecake, but not what I was expecting.  The flavor of the Guinness was extremely subtle, which was a disappointment. I made the recipe exactly as posted, and the center did not quite set up despite sitting in the refrigerator for almost 6 hours. When served, every slice split in half because it was simply too wet. But the crowd ate it anyway, and it was thoroughly enjoyed.

My turned out very mousse-like. I followed others advice and wrapped the bottom of my springform with foil, cooked in the water bath for 60 minutes, let it sit in the oven with door ajar for another 60 minutes. Then I chilled it for 8 hours before we ate it... I wonder what the problem was?? In addition to that, I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. I felt it was too sour tasting. I'm a huge guinness and chocolate lover, but this really didn't do it for me, unfortunately. Other people at dinner said they loved it...but I wonder if they were just trying to be nice? I won't be making this one again.

This cheesecake was amazing!  It was smooth, very silky, and was gone in a flash!  Very rich chocolate flavour with just the slightest hint of the beer that was loved by beer drinkers and non-beer drinkers like myself.  I had no trouble with the recipe and it turned out beautifully (though my crust did fall apart while serving, but that probably was due to the fact I used Oreo cookies instead of just plain chocolate cookies - which I couldn't find).  I did have a lot of filling left over after filling my pie tin, but I had enough cookies left over so I could make a bunch of miny cheesecakes in a muffin pan.  Turned out wonderfully!  I will definitely be making this into a St Patrick's Day tradition!

This cheesecake was incredibly rich and delicious. It was probably the best flavored cheesecake I've ever tried. I increased the cooktime to 60 mins. and used used the separate water pan method. I also let it chill for closer to 24 hours since I had to work.....this made the crust a little soggy. Overall, this recipe is well worth doing.

This is delicious! I threw my mom a birthday party and was looking for something a little different to make for dessert, and this seemed perfect.  Every person at the party loved it. It is very rich, and very chocolatey, but to a true chocolate-lover, it is not too heavy.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I will make it again, and again, and again.

Mmmmmmmmmm! I made this for my annual St. Patrick's Day party and there wasn't a crumb left at the end of the night! The cheesecake is easy and delicious. I used chocolate teddy grahams because I couldn't find chocolate cookies for the crust and they worked great. I also increased the cooking time to 70 minutes, and it still needed to be cooked longer. Will definitely save for next year!

I bake a lot of cheesecakes so I have a lot of cheesecake experience with wonderful, successful cheesecakes. This was my biggest disaster of a cheesecake ever. I read reviews and several people addressed the issue of it not setting right. I baked it 10 extra minutes and left it in the oven after it was turned off for an hour. I chilled it in the fridge for a few hours. It looked perfect on top but when I removed my springform pan it completely collapsed. It looked like pudding, with a nicely baked top. I will never use this recipe again.

Sadly, mine did not turn out at all. It didn't set and was a soupy runny mess, a tasty mess though.

Wow! I thought this whole recipe seemed pretty odd to begin with, that's why I tried it. Stay away from this one!! I make cheesecakes quite often and this recipe is absolutely terrible. The crust on mine was very soggy and I'm convinced that water bath did nothing to help this cook because when I pulled it out of the oven it immediately started falling apart as if I'd just poured the ingredients into the pan. Don't waste your time or money on this recipe.

I'm adding my vote to the attempt to make this a 5 star recipe.  I followed the recipe with only two minor alterations.  I used dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet as we love the taste.  Also, based on previous reviews, I opted for the chocolate stout in lieu of Guinness (which I have used in a cheddar cheesecake - yum). 

I used Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers for the crust.  Note-it only covers the bottom not the sides of the pan. Make sure to bring everything to room temp, take your time, and you'll be so thrilled with this cake. I used a water bath (with the pan wrapped in foil). There were a few minor cracks on one edge which I think I caused from a bit of over exuberance in pulling the oven shelf out to check the cake.  I baked for 55 minutes (my oven can be wonky), let it sit for nearly 2 hours until I finally pulled it out, and fridged overnight.  If you're a fan of chocolate cheesecake, you are going to love this cake.

I made this recipe for a "beer feast" that I went to, where all food items had to be made using beer. I am a baker and love desserts and beer and made this delicious cheesecake. When I was making it, it was runny but it ended up baking and having a lovely creamy and silky texture. The only change I made was to add a little more melted chocolate to the batter- you can never have too much, right? Delicious recipe! I am making it again!

I couldn't find my springform pan so baked this in 2 storebought chocolate cookie crusts, baked for 35 min, and they were a big hit! I put whipped cream on when I served it, hid a few cracks in the top since I wasn't able to use a waterbath to bake them in. Everyone raved! UPDATE: I made it in a new heart-shaped springform pan. No waterbath, just put a large pan with some water in it on a lower shelf, and it came out perfectly!!

Made it following the instructions almost perfectly, only one variation. I used a whole bottle of Guinness to add some more flavor to it, as my last one was lacking some. Looks great, tastes great. Thanks for the recipe.

FANTASTIC!!!!!  EVERYONE WHO TRIED IT LOVED IT, & IT WAS EVEN BETTER THE NEXT DAY.  I DIDN'T HAVE A SPRING FORM PAN, SO I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS OF USING A LARGER BASE PAN WITH WATER IN IT AND COOKED THE CHEESECAKE IN A GLASS PAN LINED WITH FOIL.  COOKED UP BEAUTIFULLY AND THE CHOCOLATE DRIZZLE DOVER THE SIDES HID THE IMPERFECTIONS FROM THE FOIL.

Okay so the flavor of this is wooonderful!  The Guinness is subtle but is no doubt what gives that little something something.  I had to cook for at least 20 mins longer than recipe called for and maybe could have used a little bit more.  It does firm up in the fridge...overnight would be ideal.  I agree with others recommendation to just cook over a pan of water instead of putting it in it. Will be making this again and again!

I have never written a review on anything but I had to do it this time! For all of the bad reviews for this recipe I just want to say, you must have done something very wrong! I love cheesecake, have made many and have sampled many more & this by far is the best cheese cake I have had. I used Oreo cookies and cut the sugar in half instead of using chocolate waffers but, that is the only thing I changed. One thing that should have been mentioned is that the cake does not look "done" when you take it out but it it will firm up when you chill it. Also, make sure you wrap the springform pan with foil so the water doesn't get inside. Yummy!

I think this would have been more successful without the water bath.  Although I understand that the water helps to cook and cool the cake more gradually (great for cheesecakes in general), the water leaked into my springform and created a soggy mess.  A waste of good stout.

Was a big hit. I made it for my Dad's birthday and he LOVED it! Actually everyone but me loved it. I think it's b/c I really don't like the taste of Guinness. I'll make it again for everyone else again!  Don't be worried about the "too much liquid". It turned out very similar to the Eggnog Cheesecake also on this site.  Bon Chance! A

Absolutely awesome! A great treat for my beer loving boyfriend.  I used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate graham crackers instead of the 1 cup of chocolate cookies. Used a little more butter in the crust because of the additional crumbs.  Also used 1/2 teaspoon of coco instead of 1/4 teaspoon. In the filling I used an additional teaspoon of vanilla (3 total).  The end result was awesome! The beer is subtle but definitely present in the flavor. This allowed me to enjoy it as well as my boyfriend!

I have made this recipe twice now and it is the best dessert I've ever had! It sets up to be more mousse-like than a typical cheesecake and you must chill it at least 3 hours to set. I couldn't wait and cut into it early and was afraid that it would stay that soft but the next morning it was perfect. I was worried about that the first time as well because the center stayed jiggly even after turning off the oven and letting it cool. I use chocolate graham crackers for the crust and don't bother with the cocoa. I also cook it at 350 for 60 minutes then shut off the oven and leave it in for another 45 minutes. I will make this again and again.

This was my first spring-form cheesecake attempt so I was nervous to begin with. It's pretty straight forward but I will admit that the 'batter' appeared very runny. After cooking it 45 and then letting it sit 45 I put it in the fridge as the recipe said. After 4 hours, I cut a piece and noted that the center did not appear to be fully cooked. Needless to say I was really disappointed.  But, and this is important I think, my fridge was full and I'm sure the air circulation wasn't ideal. I left it overnight and by the morning everything had firmed up well. My guests for St. Patrick's Day tried it and loved it (granted they'd had a few). I think it's an amazing recipe and can't wait to try it again.

I made this recipe for St Patty's Day and it came out looking beautiful.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of cookie crumbs and two extra tbls of butter for the crust.  The flavor of the cheesecake itself isn't as chocolatey as I'd like but it wasn't bad.  I'll probably not make this again.  I don't think it's a bad recipe just not for me.

I made this for a corned beef dinner last weekend. I am not sure if the fridge at my friends was cold enough or what but I went to slice it before serving thinking it would be firm. It was not "jiggly" but very soft. It was tasty and everyone seemed to like it and said the recipe was a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly, no substitutions or anything, but the consistency of the cheesecake was not to my liking. I had to bake it much longer than the recipe required as it came out more than jello-jiggly all over.  This may have been due to our high altitude, but I have baked cheesecakes at this altitude before and have not had this trouble before.

The Perfect Cheesecake! I have been making this every St. Patrick's Day for years and it is always a huge hit! I follow the recipe EXACTLY and it comes out perfect every time. Cheesecake is a hard one to master. Take your time!

It's imperative to follow the instructions exactly.  Seal the pan tightly with foil before submerging in the water bath and make it a full day in advance.  This cheesecake was so delicious, but definitely needed time to set. Will make again and again.  For the crust, I tried putting fudge oreos in the food processor, didn't need to remove the filling, it worked perfectly. DELICIOUS!!!

This is dangerously good! I followed the directions exactly however modified by useing reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. The texture was fantastic. I'd read that using Fat Free would make it soupy so this worked great and preserved the texture and taste! We had it for dessert at home on St. Patricks day and then brought it to work (to avoid the temptation of eating the rest of it) and it was gone in about 5 min with many compliments! My husband- who is a harsh cheescake critic- loved it as well!  Making it again this weekend for a dinner party!

This cake was the hit of our St. Patty's day party. Came out just great. One friend said it should be my signature dish.
I  am making this recipe again for about the 6th time and every time we love it more

I followed the directions exactly but the cheesecake wasn't cooked through.  When we cut it, it was runny.  It was disappointing.  It definitely needs longer cooking time.  The batter tasted good though.

Please ignore the naysayers, follow the directions exactly, and enjoy! It was a huge hit at our very Irish St. Patrick's Day celebration and is certain to become a staple in the future!

This turned out fantastic for St. Patrick's day! Very moist and decadent. I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble. This goes in my file and I will use in the future. I used Smidwich's Irish beer. As a non-beer drinker I could taste a faint "beer"? taste when the cheesecake had been allowed to sit out and reach room temperature.

i love this cheesecake. I made it for st. patty's day and everyone loved it. I changed the recipe a little bit. I didnt use a spring pan. I used and 8x8 square baking dish and didnt do the bath method or open the oven for 45min. I just let it cook the hour and a half and checked it with a toothpick. Then i added a sour cream frosting to the top of the cake and let it cook an additional 10 minutes in the oven. then i finally did the chocolate decoration. It came out so good. Its so good with coffee.

I dont like to post anything negative, but would like to save anyone the dissapointment I had, especially if planning on serving this to guests.  The flavor of the batter was lovely, but I was so upset when I made this.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Cooked it in the bath, etc.  It looked lovely and done when the time was up and I put it in the frig to chill.  I went to serve it the next day and the middle was soup.  My family and I were so disappointed.

Love this flavor. Used Young's Chocolate Stout. Had fun serving it with Irish Stew that had Guinness. (Didn't follow pan directions, so mine was messy, but we couldn't even wait to let it cool.) Used a ganache on top. YUM! I am a big fan and will make it again. I am also a big fan of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, and the Holy Spirit. Now I'd better go exercise. Used full fat everything.

WOWZA!!!! this was amazing and not a bite left the next day!! I had to rate this to help knock this recipe back in the 5 star category. It seems like the people who rated this poorly had problems with the consistnecy of the cheesecake. I am not sure if this was due to error on their part or not, but I made this almost identical to the recipe and it was perfect. I made 2 minor changes. I only used 1/2 cup of guinness because previous ratings said it was too runny. I think if I had used 3/4 cup it would have been just fine however!! I also baked closer to an hour. After it baked, I left it in the oven for approx 30 minutes with the door ajar and then put in the fridge for 4 hours. It set up perfectly!! I to put a pan of water on the rack below instread of a waterbath. I decorated with crushed snickers and chocolate chips and served with cool whip and ice cream...HOLY MOLY!! It was to die for!! I encourage those who rated it poorly to try again!!

Great recipe-first cheesecake I have ever baked. I modified by utilizing Splenda mix instead of sugar and I did use Oreo cookies for crust and it still worked well. I did follow the cooking instructions (did not foil wrap the pan) and it did need more time. I put it into the oven for another 45 minutes-pan of water on rack beneath- and once it chilled it was absolutely perfect.

My coworkers ABSOLUTELY loved this, nothing left out of 2 pies!  Instead of using cookies for the crust, I crushed about 5-6 bars of chocolate graham crackers.  I forgot to put butter and cocoa powder in the mix for the second pie, but it still came out terrific.  Crust was fine without butter added.  Overall, a hit!  Have already made 4 pies that have vanished.

Make it as directed and it turns out wonderful. If you change things blame yourself for poor results.I brought this to a party and everyone asked for the recipe! I'm sick of people complaining about recipes when they change things because they think they know better.

I also ran into problems with this recipe, following the directions, regular altitude. The batter was okay, but tasted slightly sour. The batter never cooked/set properly. Perhaps some of us have oven issues?

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made and it came out spectacularly!  I followed the directions exactly, other than placing a pan of water on the rack under the springform pan, rather than the pan in the water, for the water bath.  Our friend is a huge Guinness fan and so I made this for his birthday. It was delicious and received rave reviews from everyone!  I am not one who spends a lot of time in the kitchen and I impressed myself with this, thanks for an incredible recipe that made this everyday mom seem like a gourmet! I will def. make this again. :-)

Tasted great, yet it is more of a really thick mousse rather than a cheesecake.  Hard to serve.  I reccomend putting it in the freezer before serving to prevent it from falling apart. Very rich.

This was fantastic! I served it for a large group near St. Patrick's Day and got rave reviews. It is incredibly creamy with a delicious chocolate flavor. I did not change anything in the recipe. It did not look done when I was supposed to turn the oven off, but if you used the water bath, you'll be good to go! Fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious recipe.   Everyone loved it!   Yes, follow the directions and bake in a water bath.  I had too much filling for my 9" springform pan.  It was so light and fluffy.  I used low fat cream cheese and dark chocolate chips.   I could taste the Guiness which I love, others couldn't taste it.  Definitely a hit for St. Patty's Day.

I have not made it yet but it’s very important to only use BOTTLED premium Guinness.  I’ve made several recipes using Guinness and learned that if you use another brand or use canned beer it will be bitter.  Also it needs to be room temperature.  I’ve gotten lots of compliments on my Guinness Irish Stew.

I submitted this recipe as part of an Irish dinner for our local gourmet club.  It was amazing with a wonderful, complex taste and an almost mousse -like texture.  Be sure to either wrap the outside of the spring pan in tinfoil or place the water bath on the rack below or water may get into the cake batter and water things down.

I made it and it never did set up properly. The crust became soggy overnight in the fridge and the filling actually started to run. I think if I made it again, I would cook it longer and cut down on the amount of beer. I made it exactly according to the recipe.

This cheesecake sounded amazing, but the execution was seriously off. I followed the instructions to the letter. The batter was pretty loose but I hoped it would firm up. I cooked it for 45 minutes at 350, then left it with the door cracked for 45. The only difference is I put the pan of water on a row underneath the pan, rather than setting the pan in it. The cake collapsed like a soufflé! I've cooked a lot of cheesecakes and I normally let them sit in the oven for 45 minutes with the oven closed. Anyways I pull the cake out of the oven and there is water or some liquid in the edge of the springform! It also appeared raw in the center. So I put it back in the oven at 35 for about 30 minutes and let it sit in a closed oven for 45 before putting it in the fridge. I pulled out this morning and as I removed it from my fridge more liquid spilled out of it! I've never had anything like this happen before. I cut into it and  the taste is great, but the center STILL feels raw. This has potential to be amazing but it's just not there yet.

Don't even waste the Guinness. You can't even taste the beer, but if your looking for a great chocolate mousse cheesecake then this is it. I love Guinness, but this was a waste of my beer, the chocolate overpowers the beer.  I made it for St. Patty's and my family(huge guinness drinkers) were pretty upset you couldn't taste the beer, but it was a great cake other then that. I put peanut butter in the second one I made and it was amazing! Should be renamed Peanut Butter Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake

This is my favorite cheesecake recipe. Typically, I make it with a chocolate stout instead of Guinness, it adds to the richness! Also- I always have to bake it at least 30 min longer than instructions say.

I made the recipie exactly as it was written and it was delicious! My future daughter -in-love just asked me for the recipie. My only complaint was that the crust was moist, it may have been condensation. I will definitely make this again.

Adding Guinness to chocolate is like adding coffee... it gives it a nice dark flavor.  No one would know the Guinness was in there unless you told them.  I have made many, many cheesecakes in my time and have found lots of different cooking them; I wasn't surprised to see yet another method and I had faith that the author would not steer me wrong.  I was nervous when I removed it from the oven and it was still pretty jiggly in the middle, but after refrigerating it came out just fine.  It was just slightly looser than I liked in the middle, so I may cook a touch longer before turning the oven off.  FYI, for 1/2 pound of chocolate chips, I used 1 and 1/3 cups, melted the rest of the package and spread on top of the cake after it baked.  I accidentally put more cocoa in the crust than called for and it was still yummy.  I didn't use crushed Oreos, but instead the chocolate wafter cookies and the crust was wonderful.  Next time I'm going to replace the heavy cream with Bailey's... why by an entire carton of cream for 2 tablespoons when I always have Bailey's around?

Alright I've made this twice now....first time, it cracked but I cooked for 60 min and oven door open for 60.  My water bath was a 9x12 pan of water on the lower rack.  I was too afraid to put a springform pan in a pan of water.  2nd time, I did the recipe 45 min and 45 min and while it didn't crack, it was not cooked in the middle and I was embarrassed as I served at a party.  But the flavor is delish!!!  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  I think Oreos would be too sweet by my preference.

I went searching for this recipe after enjoying a slice at our local brew pub.  I am pleased to report that I prepared it exactly as written and the result was perhaps the most delicious cheesecake I have ever prepared.  The chocolate flavor was nicely balanced and the texture unbelievably smooth.  I will be replacing my old holiday cheesecake recipe with this one!  I used Famous Chocolate wafers for the crust and I did increase my oven temp to 365f to compensate for our high altitude.  It is always helpful to cross check your oven temperature with an accurate oven thermometer.  Please try this recipe regardless of what the previous negative reviews stated.

After reading the reviews, I tried to be very precise about following the directions and buying the specific ingredients mentioned.  I also just put a 9 x 13 pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake in the oven; I didn't actually place the springform pan inside a pan of water, and this was the first cheesecake I made that didn't crack!  Everyone loved it and thought it was storebought!  Loved the leftover Guinness too :)

Have made this twice to rave reviews, once for son-in-law's birthday, then requested by our son for his. Followed recipe exactly first time (except for increasing crust ingredients by 50% since It didn't seem to cover bottom of my pan) and it was excellent.  I considered adding some mini chips or extra chocolate to crust but stayed with original recipe second time too. The Guinness gives it a richer flavor, does not taste like beer though.  Highly recommend.

It was OK, not impressive.  I didn't taste much beer flavor in it so might as well drink the beer instead of putting in the cake lol.

I wrapped the springform pan in foil for the water bath bake. I baked it 45 minutes and it was set up. It is a little to creamy and not as firm as I had hoped but the flavor is wonderful! I made little molded chocolate flowers to garnish (my attempt at clovers did not do the cheesecake justice but would have entertained my guests!).

We followed the directions to the letter, with the exception of using chocolate graham crackers for the crust instead of chocolate cookies, and it turned out fairly well. After about five hours in the fridge, we tried it and discovered that it was about the consistency of a mousse. However, after some time in the freezer, it became its true cheesecakey self and was absolutely delicious. The one thing that I would change is double the amount given for the crust to make it thicker.

BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!!!
I am not good at baking. I rarely bake at all. I have NEVER made a cheesecake before. This was my first one! It was PERFECT!!! I followed the directions exactly except for 2 things. I didn't have a pan big enough to put my springform in so I just put a baking dish of water on the shelf underneath it, like someone else mentioned. And the second thing was when the timer went off I looked and thought it was too liquidy so I left it in for another 10 mins which I should NOT have done, because that made it crack on the sides while the middle was still the same jiggly. Its supposed to be that way! it sets over night to be the SMOOTHEST most decadent cake EVER!!!
I work at a very nice restaurant and all the chefs there died over it! Thank you thank you thank you for sharing this recipe! Making it again today!!!

Amazing!!!  Just amazing.  I made it as writen, didn't change a thing.  It turned out great.  I took it to a birthday and got raves.  One guest (a professional pastry chef) said it was to die for.

So to that person with the mean review, I have only make two cheesecakes in my entire 51 years of life (this one included) and it came out perfect.

Everybody LOVED this, including me and I am normally not a chocolate cheesecake kinda person.  I tried shortening the amount of time to make it by buying an oreo cookie crust pre-made.  I don't suggest that because it was not big enough for all the ingredients so there was a good amount leftover.  But we managed to use the leftover stuff by dipping strawberries in it which was equally a fave.

the flavor was awesome, but the batter was waaay too liquidy. i thought maybe it was due to the fact that i had consumed a fair amount of guinness before i made it, but after looking over some other reviews, i feel a bit vindicated in my complaint. i used to cook 6 cheesecakes a week commercially and prolly make ten or so at home annually, so i feel VERY comfortable with making them, and this recipe was off. will tweak it and definitely make it again tho.

I have to say I've never heard of this, as cheesecake wasn't really common in Eire, but it came out good and I stuffed myself full without sharing!
