I tripled this recipe so it would make a nice layered salad for 6 people. I also used a slightly larger amount of grape tomatoes . The recipe was delicious and looked great as a layered salad.

I loved this recipe.  I make fried chicken very similar to this but I never used Cajun seasoning and it was so good! This dish is great because the chicken can be hot or cold. I was having friends over for dinner last minute and I was able to whip this up quick and actually get all the bowls set and ready on the table for when they arrived.  The only things I tweaked was using  vegetable oil instead of olive, added cucumbers and I used multi colored grape tomatoes. It was delicious, fast and beautiful to look at!

This was great! The one change I made during prep was to slice my chicken prior to breading. The reason I chose to do this was so that I wouldn't lose the breading while slicing and also so that I would have breading on all sides of the chicken. I also chose a spring mix over lettuce simply for the fact we prefer it better. This is a fast and easy recipe and one that is easily adaptable to what you like on your salad. Thanks for sharing!
