Creamy and fluffy frosting, yet still perfect for piping/decorating. One recipe, however, was barely enough to frost ten cupcakes, so keep this in mind for any of your frosting or decorating needs. I used this for coconut cupcakes, so I flavored it with some coconut oil flavoring, then topped with toasted, shredded coconut. I would call this one of the more exceptional buttercream frosting recipes.

I'm a novice cake decorator and this is the first time I've ever in my life reviewed a recipe, but I was so overjoyed I had to do it. I have been trying buttercream recipes for 4 months now, and it's been horrible. I wanted something that did not include the nasty shortening, and was easy to make. I didn't have any luck with any meringue buttercreams either, which just tasted like a big block of butter and requires refrigeration, re-whipping, etc. I was THRILLED to find this recipe! First I made the initial recipe as written, which was a small batch. Then I quadrupled the recipe to make 32 servings to frost/decorate a 9 x 13 layer cake. I found that it's EXTREMELY important to cream the softened butter for several minutes first, then I added the confectioners sugar (after sifting it first) a cup at a time until combined. Then added clear vanilla extract, and for the 4x recipe I only used 1 Tbsp skim milk. Then really important: continue to beat for another 4 minutes! Came out SO fluffy and light and snow white colored. Extremely easy to frost and pipe decorations. Got a nice crust as well. I had several "foodies" taste it and they gave it 2 thumbs up as well.  THANK YOU!!!!!

This is a great buttercream icing recipe.  I followed it fairly closely, thought I did add extra vanilla, which then necessitated adding some extra 10X sugar to make up for the extra liquid.  It does not make all that much, so I will prob double it when decorating a cake.  It made enough for me to not-over-generously ice 18 cupcakes.  Great taste and consistency.  GO BULLDOGS! ;)  TY for a great recipe!

This icing recipe is my absolute favorite out of all that I've tried!  I used it to pipe on decorations for my daughter's horse birthday cake.  I needed to add almost 2/3 cup more powdered sugar to make it stiff enough to pipe on. To decorate a 9x13" cake, you will want to double the recipe.  (Make sure you use clear vanilla if you want white icing.)

This recipe is for REAL frosting not the garbage that comes from the store. I followed the recipe without changes. This was served with SCOTTLEY'S BASIC YELLOW CAKE and the filling from ALMOND CREAM-PUFF RING. My brother ate two pieces and took half of the rest of the cake home with him. I will never buy frosting again ever.

This icing was just what I was looking for as I didnt really want to take the time to do boiling icing.  Not too too sweet but very creamy. I will use this again. Alot of flavorings can be added to this.

This recipe was good. I didn't love it, but I usually dont like any plain buttercreams. If you're going to pipe the frosting, don't add the milk. If you are going to add food coloring, add it before the milk (or else it might get too liquidy).

This was the lightest fluffiest frosting I have ever made at home. It was as good as the bakeries use for sure! I used this for soft sugar cookies and it made them over-the-top great, but truly this would fabulous on a cake. I will have to remember this one the next time I need birthday cake frosting, this is that special. This dried perfectly for stacking decorated cookies too! Thanks, this is awesome!!!

This is so much better than store-bought icing!  Just be sure to use real butter; it makes all the difference.

I was a little disappointed with this icing when I first made it. It was good and easy, but there was just a little lacking in terms of flavor. I made it again and this time used salted butter instead of unsalted (as a previous reviewer suggested), doubled the vanilla (previous reviewer again), and used evaporated milk (next time I might try cream, but I didn't have that on hand) instead of regular milk. I used extra sugar to compensate for the extra vanilla and the thin texture it had the first time (don't want to reduce the milk because I needed every drop of frosting) and it was perfect. I doubled the recipe and it was just enough to frost a 3-layer cake. I'm giving the original recipe 4 stars.

Perfect! Only change was to use fat free half and half in place of the milk because I needed to use some up.  Frosting came out sweet and satiny, and piped nicely onto my cupcakes.  I didn't bother with food coloring this time, as I wanted an ivory/white frosting.  This recipe made enough to frost a dozen cupcakes generously.

This is the best buttercream I've ever tasted.  My recipe is close, but the extra vanilla puts it well over the top.  I used salted butter, and added a little pinch of salt which I think helps balance out the flavors a bit.  Amazing texture, perfection.

Followed the recipe exactly. The butter is a nice change from shortening, and it is just as beautiful. I doubled the recipe and had no problem frosting 3 dozen cupcakes. I even did the little swirly thing on them....and that takes a lot of frosting! I used gel food coloring, and it turned out vibrant without affecting the consistency.

Made this yesterday and I think it was gone before we even got to frost the cupcakes with it! Everyone wanted recipe and LOVED it....it's sooo simple and yummy! :) Making it again today! :)

Be sure to let your cake/cupcakes COOL COMPLETELY before frosting or it will melt and not look fluffy! :) The frosting melts in your mouth. I also doubled ingredients to be able to frost 24 cupcakes!

I made this to frost my big cookie cake I made. I used 1 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar instead of 2. I also reduce the milk to 1 tbsp. It turn out just right for me and not too sweet!

Wow!  What a great frosting!  Due to health issues in my family, I made it dairy free by using Earth Balance instead of butter and rice milk instead of milk.  It's still an awesome recipe!  Tastes amazing and is light, fluffy, and creamy.  Thank you!

all below are right.  I LOVE frosting, but I know some people don't like it toooo sweet.  this is sweet, but not so much as to turn people off like some frostings.  8 million times better than store bought.  EASY to make.  When I first put the powd sugar in with the butter, I thought "this is too dry" it's not gonna work, but then by the time I added the vanilla & the milk, per instructions, it was perfect!  
I used this a couple of times, both to color and decorate character cupcakes by frosting and piping.  It made great Diego cupcakes ! and it just made awesome, Cookie Monster, Elmo, and Oscar cupcakes last wkend !

This was a good recipe, one of the better I have used.  I had trouble getting it to peak though, and it wasn't quite to the sweetness I was expecting, so I had to add a little extra sugar until I got the consistency and sweetness I wanted.  it tasted great on the Buttermilk Cinnamon Rolls I used from All Recipes.

I was in a fix when I realized one of my children broke the seal on my can of frosting tonight.  This is the first time I've made my own icing.  My husband loved it.  I didn't add or change any ingredients.  I gave it four stars because it was a little runny.  (which could be a mistake that I made.)
Thank you for helping me out of a fix. 
Cheers.

The instructions don't really give you much to go on. After a bit of research, I found that the icing comes out perfect if you do the following; 1) allow your butter to be room temperature (about 3 hours in my area did the trick. I am in Vancouver, BC). 2) Whip you butter for at least 5 minutes (more if you can) to allow enough air to form in the butter. Make sure to use the whipping extension on your mixer. 3) Switch to your mixing paddle on your stand mixer and add half of the icing sugar and whip for about 3 minutes before adding the other half of the icing sugar. Then whip again for 3 minutes. 4) Don't add all of the milk at once. Add a tbsp. at a time until your buttercream is soft and fluffy but not falling off the paddle.

My first go at making buttercream frosting, and boy am I pleased! I followed the recipe exactly, to make my version of oatmeal cream pies. My hubby is normally not a huge fan of buttercream, but he couldn't stop eating this kind! I'm excited to add other flavorings in the future!

First time making frosting and it was all a success! I am not a big fan of buttercream, and neither is my husband, but this one we all loved. My child cannot have enough. And my husband and I are for the first time interested in the frosting! (I don't know if this is good or not for us, but definitely says a lot about the frosting.)
My tweaks: I made this with MARGARINE (salted, in sticks), and I cannot imagine the result getting better. I halfed the milk (1Tsp). This recipe frosts 12 cupcakes (without piping).

Best icing recipe I have found. Everybody raves about it. It makes an incredible chocolate icing when you add cocoa powder.  The recipe doesn't make a lot, so you may need to double or triple, depending on how much you need.

I must first say that I do not like frosting.  At all.  But I'm making cupcakes for a bridal shower coming up and I thought I'd give this a whirl.  It was very very easy.  I used the KitchenAid instead of gently stirring with a spoon.  I also only had salted butter in the house.  I added a little extra milk (I used skim) and added some chocolate syrup and cocoa and it came out terrific.  For someone who doesn't like frosting, this was pretty darn good.  ...  Don't use salted butter!

I made this for the middle layer of a layer cake I was making and I followed the recipe to the T. It taste really yummy and made the perfect amount that I needed. So if you are needing to frost a lot then I would adjust the recipe.

Great great buttercream recipe, taste just like our local bakery's buttercream! I use it for filling and icing cakes and it stands up perfectly. I always add pecans to it for the filling and get complimented on it every time I make this icing!!!

I have never used butter instead of shortening in frosting before. I made it in a pinch and it turned out better than expected. Frosting stiffens up in the fridge, so if you make it ahead of time or refrigerate your cake, leave it out for a while before using/serving.

Soooooo good!  I am personally not a huge fan of buttercream frosting to start with but wanted something simple to use on a V day cake.  This was the perfect recipe!  I had to add more milk to the recipe and next time I will probably double the recipe because my husband loves a lot of frosting.  This is definitely the recipe to try.  Very easy and very delicious!

This was a great recipe for a fluffier, creamy buttercream. It does, however, need salt. Most buttercreams call for some salt and this was too sweet without it. I multiplied this recipe 6.5 times for 55 cupcakes (had lots leftover) and added about 1 tsp of salt and cut the milk in half. It had a great flavor and was the right consistency for piping cupcakes. I did put them in the fridge to set a bit before serving as it was a bit soft. There were lots of compliments and most people ate more than one. Will definitely use again. Will probably add food coloring before milk, and may use a little less milk than I did, for a slightly thicker result.

Tasted great, but it was impossible to use for piping. If you add any food coloring, it becomes really runny and just slides right off the cake. I added almost 2 cups of confectioners sugar in addition to what the recipe called for to try and thicken it up, and I still wound up scraping it all off the cake and starting over with a different recipe.

I dislike shortening so much.  I try never to use it.  So finding this recipe, that uses butter instead, was such a lucky find!  We loved it.  I made the "simple white cake" here on Allrecipes, cut it in half, and made a two layer cake.  A double-batch of this frosting covered it all with VERY little leftover to decorate - so increase the recipe accordingly.  This is a definite keeper for me.  The only complaint I can see is if someone needs a true white frosting - this won't work.

This is the ideal recipe for piping decorative borders and for piping cupcakes. Best icing recipe I have found on this site! 
I too doubled the recipe as I made 12 very large cupcakes and was afraid it would not be enough. The only changes I used half and half instead of milk and used 1tsp of almond flavoring and 2 tsps of clear vanilla. 
Excellent! This will be a keeper for all occassions

This was a delicious icing that I colored rainbow and used to top matching rainbow cupcakes. However, I still felt that it was missing something. The taste was good (though I could still detect a hint of the powdered sugar's flavor), but the texture left something to be desired. I will tweak next time but this is acceptable in a pinch like I was. Thanks so much!

2nd time making it, first time used pure vanilla extract and 2tbs of french vanilla coffee creamer instead of milk, was amazing, 2nd time used Madagascar vanilla paste was very good but my preference is your old club house brand.

This is my favorite buttercream frosting.  It's simple to make and never fails.  I follow the recipe exactly except I sometimes add a little extra vanilla or sugar.  I most recently used this to frost Red Velvet Cupcakes from this site (the recipe that uses instant chocolate pudding) and it was perfect for piping on the cupcakes.

THE BEST!!!! I've never liked buttercream frosting because it's usually too sweet and greasy tasting for me, but this is absolutely MARVELOUS! Not too sweet, delicate flavor, and light. This is now my recipe to cover all upcoming birthday cakes. No more canned frosting for me. There is no comparison between the two. 

If frosting 3 dozen cookies, 4 servings of frosting is about right.

This is delicious and the texture is fluffy. It does not leave a gross coating in your mouth, unlike the frosting recipes that use shortening.

Super tasty and really easy. I gave it 4 stars because it didn't fluff up as expected but that could be due to the fact that I mixed by hand instead of an electric mixer. Will be making this again for sure!

Very good!  I think I beat my frosting too long because it has lots of large bubbles in it, but a quick beating with a wooden spoon solves that problem.

It was amazing! I will never buy canned frosting again!! I made this frosting to decorate a cupcake cake in the shape og a 1 for my daughter's first bday. I needed 3 batches! But I think 2 would be plenty if I were just frosting 48 cupcakes, and not having to fill in the spaces between the cupcakes to make my shape. TRY IT!!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! I got so many rave reviews on this.

For the longest time I wouldn't even make cakes because I dis-liked store bought icing and couldn't find a home made recipe I liked.  Well, I found it and I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.  It is one of those that I could just eat it all out of the bowl recipes!  Thank You

This tasted exactly like the buttercream you taste on cakes from stores.  Followed this recipe to a T, and it came out great.  I personally don't care for plain vanilla buttercream, so I think needs better flavoring, but this is the best base recipe I have found so far.

A 5 star buttercream icing for sure! Super easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe, and as far as the consistancy goes if you want it thicker then just add less milk!! And, most definately use SALTED SWEET CREAM BUTTER! One thing I did that pushed this icing over the edge was I added a splash of cold French vanilla coffee from this morning. Wow!! SO delicious! Added red food coloring for my strawberry cake. Thanks for this recipe!   :)

Really like this - really is better than store bought!  It does seem a tiny bit thinner than some of the stuff you'd get at a store (but I'm a home-made nut; much prefer home made as compared to store bought); but if you refridgerate your frosting for an hour or so prior to use; it does thicken up the frosting a bit (if you're going to eat it as is, as my kids wanted to; it works fine either way); makes it more the consistancy you'd need for piping; and it stays put once you have, too;  So if you'd want an easier to spread option; use it strait away after you've made it; if you want a thicker icing better for modling and piping; put it in the fridge for a while first.  Definitely a keeper!!

I didn't like this recipe at all. I followed it exactly and made it twice as I needed a lot of icing. I was looking for professional icing like you find in the bakery, needless to say I was very disappointed.

Great texture and super easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a tad too sweet for me. I will make it again though, and try with a little less sugar.

this recipe saved the day! i originally found another butter cream recipe on this site but it turned out like doughnut glaze. and so, i continued to venture through pages of butter cream recipes that had a good star rating and were simple enough. finally, i found this recipe. it was almost perfect! smooth, thick, and not too buttery. :) i will be using this recipe again :)

I LOVE this recipe!!! Very fluffy and creamy and not too sweet. I added about 2/3 cup baking cocoa to make chocolate and it turned out so good. Like another reviewer>> I could sit and eat the whole bowl and I'm usually not a frosting person.

I absolutely love this icing! I always get a ton of compliments on it and it has the perfect consistency for decorating cakes. I always have to double it, or tripple it in order to make enough for my cakes, but it's fantastic! (:

Perfect! I made a batch of this to use for cake pops but found myself sampling it a few extra times... yum! I used vanilla bean and I loved how pretty and speckled this was! I don't know how far this would go for icing a cake, but it worked perfectly for 24cupcakes worth of cake pops.

Terrific!  Will never use canned again.  This is easy and delicious.  I did use salted butter because it is all I had in the house.  It still tasted great.  I creamed the butter and then added the powdered sugar and vanilla.  I used a bit extra vanilla.  Then after everything was mixed I added milk to get it to the consistency I wanted.  Ended up using very little milk.  I doubled the recipe and only used 1 tablespoon.  Partly because of the extra vanilla I am sure and I wanted it a little stiffer.   The recipe doubled allowed me to frost my 9 x 13 cake and have extra to pipe with.  This frosting was excellent for piping!  Definitely recommend.  Thank you for sharing.

This icing was pretty good. I used it on snickerdoodle cupcakes and threw in (a little too much) cinnamon sugar and it was very light but very sweet(probably due to the cinnamon sugar). Next time I will mix mine more and use a little less milk because it was not as fluffy as I had liked. I love that it uses all butter though.

This was wonderful in that it made a perfect amount to frost 12 cupcates and 1 8" round cake, and used ingredients I have on hand.  About the only time I have heavy cream or shortening, both common ingredients for these types of frostings, is during the holidays.  It went together like a dream, and it's just sweet enough!

I LOVE this recipe! I am very picky with frosting and usually leave it on the plate....but not this one. The flavor and consistancy is perfect. It's so smooth and creamy. The recipe does yeild a small amount if you're trying to ice a cake. With one recipe I was able to spead a generous amount between two 8" round layers and crumb coat it but didn't have enough icing left to properly spread between two 10" layers. I did doudle the recipe and it too turned out perfectly. Thanks for the PERFECT buttercream recipe!

WOW! I had all of these ingredients on hand--this tasted soooooooooooooo wonderful. I added a cube of almond bark to the mixture...I dont know if made the texture better or worse, but man it tasted good! I had to MAKE MYSELF STOP eating the icing. Will definitely use this again!

Extremely to sugary. I follwed this recipe exactly how it is stated. I've been searching for a good buttercream frosting and have yet to find one. Typically if it was too sweet i wouldnt mind because i like sweets, but it was just not appealing to my taste buds at all. It also only made enough to ice the middle and top of the cake.

Wow - this is really, really good icing1 I followed the recipe exactly with one minor exception - I used salted butter instead of unsalted. Using my Kitchenaid mixer, I whipped this up in no time. The end result was absolutely delicious and a double batch easily covered 24 cupcakes with some to spare.

Love this recipe!! Especially with added coco to make it chocolate frosting! I put this on the 'Best Chocolate Cake You Have Ever Eaten' recipe from this site, and brought it to work for a birthday party, and it was gone, with the icing scrapped from the pan! lol! :)

This was a great recipe!! My friends and I made Mickey Mouse cupcakes with this frosting and it was delicious! (Even though some of it started to melt...) I added double the amount of vanilla extract and a little bit of almond extract. Amazing!

Great icing. Couldn't be easier and I didn't change a thing (other than doubling the recipe to frost a 2 layer cake).

I used real unsalted butter. This is the best frosting! Growing up as a little girl there was a bakery that made the best cakes, I have yet to find anything similar to their frosting until now! AAA+++

Really nice crusting buttercream recipe - you just need to TRIPLE this at least in order to decorate a cake!!!!!!!  This icing was delicious because of the butter in it.  I doubled this recipe and could barely coat a 9x13 inch cake.  I wish I would have tripled it but I ran out of butter!!!!

This is my first time attempting buttercream, so I decided to try this one since it is very straight forward.  I was going for an orange flavor, so I substituted orange extract for vanilla.  It is very tasty.  I can't wait to frost my pumpkin spice cupcakes with it once they've cooled!

This was inedibly sweet and not "buttercreamy" at all. I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted like pure sugar. It was so overpowering I had to add way more butter and milk just to cut some of the sweetness. It also started going goopy after about a half hour so I had to refrigerate the cupcakes. I doubled this recipe based on the reviews, and it was twice as much as I needed for 14 cupcakes. I think it'd be more than enough as is. This was a really disappointing recipe - maybe others like tons of super-sweet icing, but I was hoping for something more buttercreamy.

I was not a fan of this frosting and neither was anyone else. Too sweet and not in a good way, either. The consistency was not anything like a buttercream that you would find at a bakery. Very disappointing.

Wow!  This icing is great!  It holds up very well in the humidity, although, I did add 1 egg white to a doubled recipe.  I used it on my brother's birthday cake.  It did not melt as most icings do and it didn't harden.  Perfect!  The cake had so many complements.  I will be using this recipe again.

After reading the ingredients on a carton of Pilsburry buttercream frosting, I decided to try this instead. It was delicious, and I will never buy store bought frosting again with all it's food chemicals and trans fats.

This is the best buttercream icing I've made!  The key really is to beat it for at least 3 minutes - such a wonderful fluffy texture.  I've never done this with frosting before, but it really makes the difference!  I used Mexican vanilla extract, it adds a great flavor.  Using real unsalted butter is important too.  I whipped up 1/2 batch of this recipe to frost "banana oat bars" from this site. ***** UPDATE 01/28/11: I doubled the recipe and it was just perfect for 24 cupcakes.

Whip the butter for 3-4 minutes before adding other ingredients. Added a pinch of salt & about 1/4 to 1/2 c more powdered sugar, & used salted butter. To die for!

This is definitely my go to. Sometimes I add a little extra butter because I don’t like super sweet buttercream. I use shortening for some of the butter ONLY for frosting I need for piping, which is rare because I’m not into cake decorating- just delicious cakes and their paired frostings :)

This is quickly becoming my go-to frosting recipe.  The first several times I made it was just for cupcakes and I had enough to frost an entire batch, but I rarely get 24 cupcakes out of a box mix.  I just recently used it for my husband's birthday cake and to be safe I doubled the recipe and also added 1 cup of sifted cocoa powder.  It made a large amount - plenty to generously frost a 9x13 cake with about 1 cup left over, so I expect for a layer cake it would be just about right.  Amazingly, it doesn't get too thick with the extra dry ingredients...even with a single batch adding in 2/3 cups cocoa powder (as suggested by another reviewer).  Flavor is overall very good - not too sweet, but you must use REAL butter.

Just finished making this recipe and it was great! I used salted real butter because that's all I had and it still tasted fabulous! Used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer and got a very smooth, creamy texture. Thank you for sharing!  Wonderful!

The taste was terrific.  I used salted butter.  After creaming the butter and vanilla, I added half the powdered sugar and half the milk, mixed for a minute then the other half powdered sugar and milk and mixed for another minute.  If anything, I could have added maybe another half TBSP milk but this worked well piped on cupcakes.  I'll use this recipe again.

I made this buttercream as a tester for an upcoming wedding cake. Everyone, and I mean everyone loved it! I'm so excited to use it in the wedding cake.

Excellent buttercream!  Sweet but not overpowering, rich and creamy.  Great base for any flavor you'd like.  Defintitely double if you're frosting a double layer cake.

This is the same recipe that I have been using for 50 + years from my mother's Betty Crocker cookbook.  When I want chocolate frosting I just add cocoa powder.   I have never tried using it as my decorator frosting but now that I know other's have used it for decorating, I will try it.  It's a lot easier to remember how to make this than regular decorator frosting using Crisco (which I don't keep around any more.)

I was a cake decorator during college and this icing was no where near the thickenss it needs to be.  It was too runny, doesn't stand up well for decorating.

Perfect....freezes like a dream and comes back to buttery goodness in just a few minutes left at room temperature.  When I'm done frosting my cake with several different colors of this I put them all in a pastry bag and make tie-dyed cupcakes...nothing goes to waste!

I have made this several times and I've been happy.  Yesterday hubby bought margarine instead of butter so I had to go with it.  Runny goopy mess!  *You must use butter on this* or it will separate and if you put it on cake/cupcakes it will just run off.

THis is the only buttercream recipe that I will use, and have been using it for 5 years now.  I do usually have to atleast double the recipe to cover a cake or 24 cupcakes.  This buttercream will not fail you.

Very good frosting, but I wish I'd read the reviews before hand, as it barely made enough to frost a two-layer cake.  Taste and ease are definitely 5 star, though!  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Great recipe!  The key seemed to be the 3-4 minutes of beating once all the ingredients are in, so don't skimp on that.  I thought it needed a bit of salt to balance the sweet after the 1st try, so i tried salted butter the next time, and that seemed to do the trick.

Very tasty and perfect consistency. I had 36 jumbo cupcakes so I quadrupled the recipe with no problem. If you're piping, I suggest making a double batch to have enough.

I used this recipe to frost lemon cupcakes for Easter. I subbed lemon juice for the vanilla extract and I doubled the recipe for 22 cupcakes. I ended up with maybe 1/2-3/4 c leftover frosting. This is the best frosting I have made to date! YUM!

Fantastic frosting, super light and fluffy.  Very yummy taste, not at all like your typical homemade frosting.  I frosted my cake (I made a double batch), then I colored some frosting and put it in to piping bags. Since the frosting is softer I put the piping bags in fridge to firm up for a little while. I was able to make a great border and write on the cake with it.  I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks!!!

Great, easy recipe. I am not someone who cares for icing/frosting very much but even I like this one! I just needed to frost 9 cupcakes and it was enough to heavily frost with a piping bag with a bit left over. Thanks so much!

this was absolutely delicious and a big hit with my family... my little brother kept trying to steal the icing out of the bowl before i could decorate the cupcakes. I doubled the recipe and added a little less sugar than the recipe calls for and in addition used salted butter (i couldn't find anything else) it came out wonderfully!

Very light, creamy, and fluffy. Easy to spread. I DID use unsalted butter. Makes just enough to liberally ice the top of a 9 x 13 cake! Thanks!

This frosting is just great for cupcakes! It's wonderful, light, and fluffy and it holds its form very well on top of cupcakes. It's also completely not sticky! For those wanting a less sweet and more "health conscious" version, try replacing 1/3 of the sugar with Splenda. It cuts a lot of calories and retains the consistency of the buttercream -- the only slight difference is it's a touch stickier when eaten straight out of the bowl. On a cupcake it's not noticeable, except for a noticeable decrease in sweetness. I increased the recipe by 1.5 -- using 3 cups of sugar (2 confectioner's and one splenda), creamed the butter for about 3-4 minutes, then added the sugar mixture and followed the recipe exactly. Brilliant!

I love this recipe I doubled the recipe and it frosted 36 cupcakes. It is GREAT for piping and it tastes AMAZING. It is easy and doesn't use that much powdered sugar! I love this recipe!!!

I made this recipe as is (I did double it) and it was great.  It does need to be refrigerated - but I always put my cake in the refrigerator anyway.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to use unsalted butter - I only had salted butter on hand it it turned out fine - but I can see it having a different flavor with the unsalted.  It's a great recipe and does taste professional!

Since I prefer the all-butter, no shortening version of buttercream frosting, this was very good.  As mentioned by others, you really have to double the recipe in order to ice a whole two-layer cake or a dozen cupcakes.  A big hit with my family and the neighborhood kids.

This is great for things like cinnamon rolls and cut out cookies.  It wasn't quite the 'professional' taste I was looking for for cupcakes and cakes though.  Will likely use for Christmas cookies.  I doubled the recipe and added 2 tbsp of vanilla to tame the overly sweet powdered sugar taste.

Made blue icing for a chocolate cake - Tip: Don't add any more liquid. I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and ended up using a 2 lb. bag of confectioner's sugar! Turned out great for my cake and tasted good! Thanks! I will definitely make this again!

This was fantastic and a huge success for my first time making buttercream frosting.  I doubled the batch and had more than enough to frost a two layer cake.  It's nice and light.  And, had great consistency.

Used this recipe to frost a batch of 33 cupcakes for my son's 2nd birthday party. I doubled the recipe and ended up with just a little bit left over. I used my stand-mixer...which wouldn't work with just a single recipe (too little butter for the attachment to reach). So if you just need a small amount of frosting, use your hand mixer. Yielded a fluffy, sweet frosting that got lots of compliments.

I used regular instead of unsalted butter so the taste was very good, but it was way too unstable in the proportions given in the original recipe.  It was not firm enough at all - it melted right off my well cooled cupcakes and it was not a hot day or anything.  I added more powdered sugar - a lot more probably another cup and that did it.

Love this recipe b/c it is quick, easy, and tastes great!  I ended up only using 1 tsp of vanilla (for a yield of 2 1/2 cups) instead of 1 1/2 and it was still fluffy and wonderful to use for piping.  I used it for my daughter's two tier 1st birthday cake and our guests loved it as well.  :-)

Wow this is super yummy, and as advertised, VERY easy to make. I followed direx exactly and the texture was perfect for frosting. Very, very buttery, actually more so than I prefer. It reminds me a lot of the icing at Whole Foods. I am going to experiment with 1/2 crisco next time.

Delicious & easy!  Made enough to top 24 cupcakes (no piping).  I loved this recipe and will definitely use it again, if I were to pipe with it I'd refrigerate it for at least 15 minutes.

This is a nice Piping icing, I managed to get 16 cupcakes piped with a Wilton 1M tip. I followed the ingredients to a T, I found that the vanilla was a bit stong for my taste.  However, the kids gave it two thumbs up.

This is my new go-to recipe for vanilla frosting, and I've used it to make fancy cupcakes twice in the past month. For some batches I've had to add extra sugar, though, as the creamed butter became too soft to decorate with.  I made my first batch with real butter, but then discovered that using vegetable-based butter spread didn't negatively impact the flavor -- it was less fattening and still delicious!

I made this to frost chocolate cupcakes today and it came out delicious. I don't usually like buttercream (too sweet for me) but this was really good. I will definitely make this again. The only thing I did differently was replaced the milk with half and half since I only had skim and didn't think it would be as good with the skim milk. The half and half worked nicely. I also doubled the recipe and it was just enough to frost about 24 cupcakes (however, I piped on the frosting so it used a little more than it usually would - I barely had enough that way). If you plan to frost and fill a cake, I recommend doubling the recipe as well.

This icing did what I wanted it to: stand up for decorating cupcakes.  I am not a huge icing fan in general, and didn't necessarily like this more or less than the store bought kind - it was just different in flavor using butter rather than the shortening used in the canned stuff.  I gave it 4 stars because it's buttercream, it was easy to make (and adjust flavoring as needed by substituting the vanilla), and it made enough to crumb coat 44 cupcakes.  It has a STRONG butter flavor, which I supppose is the nature of the beast, but be warned.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was fantastic! I only had salted butter on hand, but it turned out great nonetheless.  So smooth and creamy! I doubled the batch for 24 cupcakes and had a liberal amount for each. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!!

I have made numerous icings before, and for some reason they turn out like a glaze or some other weird consistency. This icing is the best one so far. Its very simple (doesnt require heating or anything). I was about to resort to just buying store icing again after my failed attempts, but not anymore. thanks for sharing :)

Good, quick frosting, but this will really only frost an 8-inch, single layer cake--and just barely.  I made the mistake of making it while the cake was still in the oven and it started to melt pretty quickly.  I refrigerated it and it deflated.  I tasted it right after making it and it was perfect, but after it deflated, it tasted really sweet.   Still, I'd make it again if I'm in a hurry to eat a cake!

This icing is super quick and easy.  I doubled the recipe and was able to frost lots of cupcakes for a school event.  I did not have any food coloring on hand, but the crisp white icing was the perfect palate for my son decorate with colorful sprinkles.  Gradually added a few additional drops of milk to get the right consistency.  I didn't bother sifting the sugar.  It was buttery good!

Incedible! I realized, too late, that my homemade cream cheese frosting wasn't enough to cover a very big layer cake.  I whisked this Vanilla Frosting up in less than 5 minutes and used in between the layers. Next time I'll use it for the whole cake, I love that extra vanilla tase!

very good icing. Add a bit of sifted cocoa, and you have chocolate icing! A bit too soft for piping roses, but can decrease amount of liquid, or add more sugar to make it stiffer, and that would work great.  Very easy to make, and great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was terrific! I made the powder sugar myself and used rice milk. I had to add more than 2 cups powder sugar, but it was still delicious. It was fluffier than other recipes I've tried. I made mini cupcakes to go with it and there was more than enough for samples, tasting, and 24 mini cupcakes. There was some left over after all that. It tasted like the frosting that is on the bakery cake that have too much frosting. It was very easy to spread. Everyone should try this!

It was even good with salted butter, I bet it would have been out of this world with unsalted! Came out smooth and creamy. I didn't have much powdered sugar so I cut the recipe in half. It was so tastey and doesn't make you feel sick like store frosting made with hydrogenated oils does.

Because of a time crunch, I made a white cake from a mix to take in to work for a co-worker's wedding shower.  I don't like the taste of ready-to-eat frosting, though; so I perused Allrecipes to find a frosting recipe I thought would work. I'm glad I landed on this one!  It worked beautifully; a wonderful complement to white cake.  I did multiply the recipe by 1/2, according to other reviews stating that it didn't make very much, as I like a thick layer of frosting on cake!  I also substituted solid shortening for 2 Tbsp. of the butter.  I like the consistency that shortening lends to frosting.  I'm sure it still would have been perfect with all butter used, however.  Great basic recipe!

YUM! I made this frosting for my husbands birthday cake. it was my first time making home-made frosting, and WOW!! it tasted great!!! i gave my 15 month old son a tiny taste and he said "mmmmmmmm" right away!! I do think the recipe needs to be doubled or even tripled for thoes who like a lot of frosting, which I do. I think next time i make it i might set aside a little bit and add a little more powdered sugar to make the frosting have a stiffer consistancy for piping decorations. I might also try adding some cocoa powder to make chocolate.  Over all this is a great easy frosting that tastes great! And I honestly think it tastes better than bakery frosting. No more can store bought frosting for me!  As Rachel Ray would say. its "Yum-O"

FINALLY!!! A wonderful-tasting recipe without the nasty vegetable shortening! I followed this recipe to the letter and will definitely use it again, but must admit that it is not "tough enough" for cake decorating.   It's wonderful for icing cupcakes and roughly icing cakes for very casual occasions, but in my humble opinion, this won't do very well with piping and decorating.  Nonetheless, you owe it to yourself to try this recipe!

This was so easy!  I really wanted a recipe that didn't call for shortening, and this was perfect. It spread beautifully. My only complaint is that I should have made it a bit stiffer for the piping - next time I will set some aside before I add the milk.  I doubled the recipe for my layer cake and used coconut milk and coconut extract and used it for "Coconut Cake IV".  Everyone loved it - thanks for such a quick and easy recipe!

Wow.  This was really good and very easy.  No need for heavy cream or anything I don't often have on hand which was the most appealing to me.  It was also really great piped onto my halloween cupcakes.  I doubled the recipe because I wasn't sure how much one stick of butter would make for a cake mix recipe - 24 cupcakes - and I didn't want to have to make another batch with different colors of icing.  I had extra icing leftover.  Can't say how much the leftovers would cover but I piped it on really heavy, so I'm not sure if it would cover another entire cake mix or not.  I'll use the leftovers it to frost some cookies.  Thanks!

I’m not much a cook but can follow a recipe. I only had salted butter so I used that. I couldn’t find my sifter so I did not sift the sugar. It was amazing anyway. My household were raving. They said I was as good as or Aunt that had the recipe in her head and was a great cook!!  It is a small amount but oh so worth it.

I loved this recipe. It was so easy to follow and it came out great. It can be modified very easily too; I whipped in melted peanut butter and made it a peanut-butter buttercream. It was my first time ever making frosting, and it was a HUGE success.

The buttercream looked amazing and delicious while I made it, but when I tasted it, all I tasted was sugar. Once I put it on the cupcake it looked great but then almost immediately started to soften and drip. The cupcakes were completely cool, so it had no reason to do so. The amount of sugar made me sick to my stomach!

How dare the market still yet sells processed, expensive frosting--in the presence of this sweet recipe?! Smooth and satisfying, it is difficult not to wipe the bowl clean!  Especially when you meddle with extra vanilla . . .                                                   Invite approximately 1/4 cup of dutch cocoa powder (or more, if desired) into this recipe . . . and you have whipped up chocolate frosting.  :)

Came out perfectly! I normally really mess up frosting recipes. This one is practically fool proof. Make sure you use real butter and whole milk.

Allrecipes are usually my go-to recipes and never fail. When it was in the mixer, I thought it was rather sparse. Well, it may frost a few cupcakes or cookies, but it will not frost an 8-inch, two layer cake. I would double or even triple the recipe to frost a cake. As it is, I will have to make a new batch of frosting and refrost the cake to cover the sides. I think the taste is perfectly fine as is the consistency.

It was amazing before I added the milk in, but after I added the milk in it turned to a gritty  mess. I tried to salvage it  with flour it  worked and tasted amazing with my chocolate muffins, but don't add the milk it will ruin everything!

Wow, best looking frosting I have ever made!   Would have been best tasting too, but...I switched to clear lemon flavoring I had on hand, so the frosting wouldn't turn yellower than it already was.  I forgot I had doubled the recipe & couldn't figure out why it wasn't tasting very lemony.  It's still good, though, and doubling recipe generously covered my 13x9 cake (no sides). Be sure you're using a good quality butter, because it gives it a good taste even if you don't add the flavoring. Also, I skipped the sifting without it creating any problems.

Yummmm!!  Frosted a layered loaf perfectly.  I split my cake loaf in half and filled with homemade lemon curd (perfect lemon curd from this site).  Super easy....and tastes just like bakery buttercream.  Make sure you first beat your room temp butter like it stole your money......you won't be disappointed!!

I've made this twice now, and the first time I increased the confectioner's sugar to 3 cups for proper consistency. It still was too greasy, so the second time I decreased the butter to 1/3 cup, while still using 3 cups of confectioner's sugar. That's about perfect!

So delicious! It doesn't yield much so next time I might double it. The consistency was good until my four year old went crazy with food coloring. Even though she added way too much the frosting sort of turned into a pretty glaze and we just poured it on the cake. Will definitely make again!

This was my first try at homemade icing. We needed gray cupcake icing for Halloween. I doubled the recipe to cover 2 dozen cupcakes. I had extra left over. I had compliments all night. I'm not a great cook but this was fun and easy to do. I will never use canned icing again.

I made a birthday cake for my 6 year old daughter today and she hates frosting that is from a can or even on store bought cupcakes.  So, I decided to make her home made frosting.  She really liked this frosting, but I had to scale back on the sugar. I made one batch and it was way to sweet for her.  When I realized that one batch was no where near enough to frost and decorate her 9 X 9 cake, I added another batch, using less milk and sugar.

I probably used about 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cup of sugar per batch.  I had to beat it for awhile to get the consistency and then I refrigerated it while her cake cooled and it was easy to frost with.

Make sure to double this recipe unless you are only making a dozen cupcakes.  It's a decent recipe.  If you are a hard core decorator, you probably can't scale back much on sugar because it is a bit too creamy.  But, I just needed to write her name and I put some other decor on her cake, but nothing fancy.

This is the best recipe I have found yet. I read some other comments and made sure to follow the directions to a T. i did make a couple changes.  I didn't use all the vanilla or milk, I make a 3x batch and used 2 tsp vanilla and 4T milk. The consistency was still very nice and fluffy, I was going for a little stiffer frosting for some cupcakes for an outside party.

Amazing texture, tastes great!  Not too sweet but I did add a dash of salt like I always do to cut the sweetness.  I've been looking for years for a good buttercream that doesn't include shortening due to taste, and I've found it!  This will be my go to for cakes and pastries from now on!  I only needed a cap full (from gallon) of milk-not the reccomended 2Tbspns it calls for for the perfect consistency for decorating.  For a large cake I recommend doubling the recipe.

This recipe is by far the easiest and most delicious buttercream frosting ever.  It truly does taste like an actual professional cake maker made it.  It does not taste like the gross store bought buttercream, it's light fluffy and sweet but doesn't have a gross  processed sugary taste to it. Also, like many other people said, it was super easy to decorate cupcakes with! The recipe doesn't make a lot. If you are just quickly frosting your cupcakes with a knife, there will be plenty of frosting, but if you plan on piping the cupcake, you probably will have to double it.

I love buttercream frosting - although I do seem to get more compliments when I use heavy whipping cream in place of milk, and that actually does make a really noticeable difference even though you aren't adding much.

ORIGINAL (3/12/2016): Wow! I frosted some spice cupcakes with these. It was really good. Acceptable, yet watery, texture. But it was a bit too sugary, so I'd recommend putting less sugar. Overall, really good!

EDIT (8/22/2017): I made this again! The texture was nicer,  probably because I mixed it for longer. The last time I made this frosting, it was watery because I didn't mix it for the required time. But today, I mixed it for 3-4 minutes.

I made this recipe today to use as a filling for some gingerbread sandwich cookies I made. I read most of the reviews so I was pretty excited. I made this frosting, and it was delicious! Instead of using 1-2  tablespoons of milk, I used about 1-2 teaspoons and it was the perfect, thick consistency. The only thing is that it's pretty sweet, so some people may not like it. But otherwise, it was amazing and I will totally use this recipe again!

Great recipe! I used whipping cream instead of milk, as it makes it much lighter and fluffier. Also, it's a very small batch, so depending on the size of your cake, it needs to be doubled, possible tripled. Everyone loved the cake I made and I've been asked to make cakes for others since then.

Excellent.  I tinted this recipe green and unlike other buttercreams that "break" this one held up beautifully.  And I love that it is an all-butter recipe and does not include shortening.  I think it needs to be refrigerated since it is all butter.   I only had buttermilk on hand and it worked out fine.  It piped like a dream onto cupcakes.  This yielded enough to frost 12 cupcakes.  A keeper!

Perfect for frosting a birthday cake. Make sure you freeze the cake first. If you are cutting shapes, spread a first thin layer, let the icing harden (the beauty of real butter!!!) and then, spread another layer to hide any crumbs. MUCH much tastier than royal icing.

Very good! I add 1-2 tbsp of cream cheese, not really enough to taste like a cream cheese icing, just enough to add to the creaminess. I used a little extra milk to make it almost a drizzle consistency for cinnamon rolls. Recipe is also delicious as written.

I used whipping cream instead of milk but otherwise followed the directions. It was great! A light icing that was great on white cake. And easy to spread.

I felt like this was the first buttercream I've made that I actually liked! It is like the kind of frosting you get from the grocery store birthday cakes (meaning it's super sweet and crusts after piping), but that's what I was expecting, and the flavor was wonderful! I would definitely use this as my go-to buttercream recipe. No changes were made.

To die for! This is only the second time I've made icing from scratch. Omigoodness! So very tasty! The guys loved it! Definitely will make again and again. It was a bit too stiff for piping (I'm not experienced so I put the icing in the bag, and I just couldn't squeeze it out). Saved it for a few days later. Brought it to room temperature. Added a couple more tablespoons of heavy cream. Perfect!!

Did this recipe for cupcakes tonight.  I tripled the recipe and had just enough to do 2 dozen using a large star tip decorator.  It could be that I had tripled the recipe that did it, but I found it a bit runny for cupcakes, in fact, I have put them in the fridge for fear they will melt before my bake sale tonight.  It is a sweet butter cream, but butter cream is supposed to be sweet.  I think I will stick with my cream cheese frosting from now on!

This icing was amazing! It was so smooth and creamy. There were no lumps at all.  The icing was fluffy and piped onto the cupcakes very well.  I will be making this again very soon.  Can't wait to try it on a cake!

Love, love, love this recipe.  I've used it to make a princess dress cake with all sorts of piping and flowers and it held up beautifully.  It has a great flavor.  Like many have said, watch your amounts depending on what you are using it for.  I did change the serving size to 20 when making cupcakes.  It generously frosted 35 cupcakes with the frosting being piped on.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I don't know why anyone would use store bought when this is so easy and sooooooo much tastier!

This buttercream was amazing!!! I doubled the recipe to frost a layered cake. I would add the milk a tablespoon at a time till you got your desired consistency. I also added 3/4 cup cocoa to a doubled batch, SO GOOD! This is my new go to recipe for buttercream icing and chocolate buttercream icing. Thanks for sharing.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I was looking for a good icing that didn't use eggs, and this is perfect.  I've made it several times, and it always turns out great.  It made a boxed cake mix taste wonderful (and I'm definitely a snob when it comes to cake mixes that aren't from scratch).

The icing tasted wonderful however it needs to be thicker to be able to decorate with it especially after adding color to it...I would also double the recipe because it doesn't make enough icing for one of the cup cake, cakes.

Turned out perfect. Great consistency. I did end up doubling the recipe based on suggestions from other reviewers. I used it on a 9x13 cake and had a little extra leftover. Will use this recipe again! :)

This is a GREAT buttercream frosting recipe(even using margarine since that is all I had).  Just be sure to let the butter soften before you mix it up and it will be a perfect consistency.  This uses less confectioner's sugar than others, so I think it tastes just right (not too sugary).  The next time I made this recipe, I mixed in a cup of marshmallow creme (fluff) for chocolate cupcakes, and it was amazing.  This does make the frosting a little more runny, but tastes great.

Multiplied times 4 for my 3 layer round cake.  I think times 3 would have been enough.  This icing held up really well.  With the unsalted butter, I found it to be too sweet so I added a dash of salt and used half and half instead of milk.  Very good!!

Made it pink for Erin's baby showerby adding strawberry jello. Andrew loved it. I think he wanted to take all of the leftovers home with him. I made way too much, though. Loved all the buttery flavor!

I used this for my kids' birthday cake and it turned out great. I doubled the recipe as it was a pretty big cake. It is quite sweet so I don't recommend frosting the cake with a heavy hand. I just used enough to cover the cake with an additional 1/4". Highly recommended!

Just like my Grammy used to make! I did double the recipe, which worked out fine. As is, it is great for straight frosting. For piping, I do recommend tossing it in the fridge for 30 minutes or so.

This icing was fantastic tasting and it had no after taste like using shortening can leave. It might not be the best as far as having that 100% perfect wedding icing look but it gets the job done. It's great for piping swirls, grass/hair, etc but it looked just ok on the practice roses. Maybe others can have better luck making really good roses with this but we didn't. Thankfully, we didn't need roses. We used this to pipe a swirly cone on the cupcakes and then topped the cupcakes with a fondant flower. We also used this recipe as a crumb icing for the fondant covered belly cake my sister made.  The difference was, for the crumb icing, the recipe was made exactly as called for. 
For piping, I made 2 batches of this recipe w/o any milk at all. For one, I left white. For the other, I added 1/4 packet of Duncan Hines Frosting Creations Strawberry Shortcake flavor and a little red coloring to make it a little more pink. I then put pink on one side of the piping bag and white on the other and swirled the two-tones icing onto the cupcakes. It would have been a lot easier had I used two separate bags & stuck them inside one bag than trying to get the 2 colors to go down one bag evenly. I had icing all over me but it got the job done. The two tone color was very pretty.

Thought the frosting flavor was good but hubby and I thought it was too sweet. I ended up frosting 24 cupcakes lightly with this recipe. Also the consistency wasn't very stiff for me to spread on the cupcakes. Will probably use a different frosting recipe next time.

Tastes amazing - but the butter separated after I added my colouring. I am thinking I over whipped it, but will try again soon.

This was really way too sweet for me. This recipes makes 8 servings, but I was able to frost 24 cupcakes with it and still have some left over. I couldn't put much on the cupcakes - just too sweet!

This was by far the best frosting I have ever had!! Let me start by saying I am not a cake or frosting maker this was my first go at this type of frosting. I ended up tripling the recipe because other reviews said one batch barely covered a batch of cupcakes. That is so not true! I generously frosted two nine inch cakes (stacked) and one 9x13 pan and still had leftovers. I think what may have yielded a much fluffier frosting was leaving the stand mixer run for longer (I had a distraction). I brought them over to my in-laws for a party and EVERYONE was in love with this frosting. It is sweet and rich but it really made a cake from a box (Pillsbury) taste like it was from scratch.

This was lovely, quick and easy.  I left the milk out in order to have a stiffer frosting.  Worked beautifully for piping.  I made 1.5 times this recipe -- 3 cups sugar, 3/4 cup butter.  It was JUST enough to cover 2 layers of a 9-inch round cake, with a tiny bit left over for piping.  If you're doing a lot of piping (multiple colors, etc.), you might want to make a double batch.   Definitely keeping this one for future cake-baking; no more store-bought frosting for me!!!

Used this to decorate a birthday cake. Great for piping! Flavor and texture were great. I saved a bit for the white parts of the cake and added vanilla to the colored parts (fyi: vanilla will turn your icing light-brown).

This was great! I had to add more 10x sugar because I added lemon juice and rind to make a lemon-flavored frosting, but when it looked right, it was right! Thank you for this recipe!

For some reason my frosting didn't fluff up. I felt this recipe was average. I did half vanilla and half lemon.

This is a great frosting recipe & simple! Used 1/2C butter as directed then 2C sugar. I used 2tsp banana extract instead of vanilla for a banana cake & frosting & ended up only using 1tbl of milk for the right consistency. Covered a 9X13 cake without need to double it like other reviews. Made this by hand! It's a keeper! Thank you!

Loved the flovor of the icing....my only complaint is you CAN NOT let this stuff get warm, since it is all butter it WILL melt!!  Otherwise, tastes great!!

Very good. I used to frost and decorate a double layer cake. I used 2.5x the standard recipe and had leftover icing. I followed someone's advice of chilling the icing in the piping bag. Held its shape and tasted great.

Excellent!! Wonderful buttercream frosting and easy to make--just remember to make a double/triple batch if you have a lot of frosting to do, it's a pretty small recipe. I love it!

I just made this for some coconut cupcakes.  I made one batch vanilla and one batch chocolate and the chocolate was AMAZING!  I added about 2/3 cup cocoa as was suggested by a previous reviewer.  It turns out thick and almost fudge-like.  Best frosting I have EVER made.  I added too much milk to the vanilla and it was a bit runny, but still good.  It was also my first time piping the frosting onto cupcakes so it was a milestone baking event.

I made this again for tye dyed cupcakes.  It was vanilla flavored and awesome. Absolutely awesome

delicious! But i think i accidentally made mine a little more liquidy than i wanted :/  and i also like it because it doesn't need shortening or vegetable shortening, ingredients that i don't have in my house hha. Cuz i'm just an 18 year old girl

Good, but I found it extremely sweet, and I normally love sweet. I'll try it again using a different flavor next time, because I think the vanilla added to the "too sweet" factor, and overpowered it. I prefer more butter flavor to my buttercream icing. It was easy to spread, though!

This is probably THE best icing recipe! It tasted REALLY good, and it is perfect for piping! You can cut some of the sugar and it is still firm enough to pipe.

This had good flavor.  Maybe I use less frosting than most, but I was able to liberally frost 16 cupcakes and still throw out enough for about 3 more.  I'd use this again.

This was perfect... AT FIRST! I ended up ruining it by trying to flavor it with chunks of fresh raspberries. The butter separated, and made it a bit runny. It was totally my fault, though. I will definitely use this recipe again. however I will only use flavored extracts to flavor again.

Finally... I have found a simple buttercream icing recipe that has real vanilla & real butter in the list of ingredients.  I couldn't believe imitation vanilla & imitation butter (whatever that is) were key ingredients in so many other recipes.  If you use 'fake' ingredients, most people will notice.  Can't wait to try this one.  You can't go wrong using the real stuff!

This recipe was great! Not too sweet but still sweet enough, and it went great with "extreme chocolate cake", which is also on this website. I had to make another half batch of this frosting though because it wasn't enough for my two layer cake. But this is a great buttercream frosting and it's super easy to spread!!

This frosting is delicious!  I made a few modifications.  First, I doubled the recipe.  I used 3/4c shortning, 1/4c butter, 2 1/2 t vanilla, 5 cups of powdered sugar and 1/4c of milk.  Very good!!!

WOW!!!  This icing was amazing!  I have NEVER made icing before and this was super easy, quick and YUM!  I used real vanilla, so I only used 1/2 tsp.  ENJOY!

I'll be honest.  I thought this would be good.  It was a good tasting recipe.  It just doesn't do well if you are going to make it and wait to use it.  The butter gets very soft.    i would use this again; but, would use it right away.  You can't let it sit.  The butter doesn't hold up as well.  My roses flopped massively.

The consistency was runny, but it wasn't smooth either. Slightly grainy, even though I mixed it well without over-mixing.  Like another reviewer posted, it tasted like "sweet nothing"- sugary and bland at the same time. I used it anyway to frost cupcakes, hoping the actual cake part would make up for the frosting, but several people mentioned that the frosting was not good.

Brilliant. One of the best, simplest toppings I've ever used. I'm all about "homemade  - fast and easy" and this "took the cake". (So to speak.)  :-)

I rarely give out 5 star ratings but this deserves it. Perfect consistency, buttery taste. Overheard someone saying "this is the best icing i've ever had in my life" at a recent bday party I made the cake for. Enough said.

I doubled this recipe.  OMG it was so good.  I usually just buy the Betty Crocker icing, but decided to get a little "fancy" for my oldest son's 7th birthday.  This icing is so good.  Will definitely be making this for all my cakes in the future!

I just tried out this recipe for some cupcakes and it turned out great!  It is so light and creamy.  I did have to refrigerate it for awhile as suggested by another review.  I was piping it on and needed it to firm up just a bit.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a very good recipe, although it was not enough icing. I used it on 2 9inch cakes but found it was not enough icing while I was in the middle of icing it. I made another batch of icing and it worked wonderful. Thank you for sharing this recipe but it should be at least doubled. :)

I just found my go to "vanilla" frosting.  The frosting is so light and creamy, not what I expect from a buttercream.  I did have to make 1.5 times the recipe to frost 24 cupcakes, but we do like a generous amount on them.  Thanks for the fast, easy and delicious recipe!

I love this Buttercream recipe.   I found that I have to add a little more milk to mine to give it the texture that I'm happy with.  I love how easy it comes together and will be using this all the time now when baking.

very delicious. i tried the other "Buttercream Icing" and it was terrible. it separated and ran down the cake. i scraped that one off and tried this one. so awesome!!! I will use this recipe and only this recipe from now on. You may need to add a few more drops of food coloring though. I tried making a blue frosting and it was so pale it still looked white. but other than that this recipe is awesome!!

This icing is delicious! I was a bit nervous at first b/c it didn't look like there was going to be enough liquid to turn it into "icing".  It was very powdery before adding the milk. This doesn't make alot. I had just enough to cover a 2 layer 8" cake. If you have a larger cake than that, I'd suggest making more than one batch.

This was delicious frosting!  But then I'm a vanilla lover all the way!  I brought the butter to room temp, actually sifted the powdered sugar, and used only 2 teaspoons of milk.  It was perfect!  Yum!

FANTASTIC!  This is a great recipe. I halved the recipe and it was enough for a 8x8 cake. What is so nice about this frosting is it doesn't have the grainy texture that a lot of frostings made with confectioners sugar have. It had a nice white satin look to it without coloring. This is my only buttercream frosting from now on. Update: The second time I made this was the whole recipe. I found that I needed to add more milk to get the desired consistency. I also added about a 1/2 cup of peanut butter which made it even better. Everyone raved about it!

First time making buttercream and this was so easy and worked out great. Added yellow coloring to match our cake for Easter and it was pretty. My daughter had fun frosting her frist cake. We will use this from now on instead of store bought.

This is a wonderful icing. Fluffy, smoth, sweet (my eldest thought it was a little too sweet so 4 stars) I  accidentlally dumped the butter and sugar together and it still worked out gorgeously. So quick to prepare.

Made exactly as directed.  One of my beaters broke while making the cupcakes, and I had to make by hand, so didn't turn out as fluffy as I would have expected, but the flavor is perfect.  This frosting is just sweet enough and light.  It might sound weird, but it has a 'clean' taste to it.  I think this frosting would also work very well for cookies.  This is my new favorite frosting!

I loved this recipe!  I made some changes to enhance the flavour: 10% cream instead of milk + SALTED butter + REAL vanilla extract.  The little bit of salt in the icing helped curb the yummy sweetness.

I have been on the hunt for the perfect icing recipe for months now and this is the best one! All I can really say is THANK YOU!!! Its lovely and light and not too sweet. I would agree with you as it being almost-professional standard. Easy to make with common ingredients. But tastes and looks so good.

Smooth and creamy!  Easy to make as long as you follow the recipe.  If your icing tastes granular, you didn't give it enough time to incorporate the butter and sugar.  I added cocoa powder to make a chocolate buttercream and it came out great.  Thanks for a great recipe that was so easy to make.

This is really good frosting and it's really easy to make. Make sure that you continue to whip it for a while after its all combined, so that all the powdered sugar dissolves.

*** I made this again last night and added 3 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder. Delicious!

*** This time I ommitted the milk, and thinned it out with Blueberry Jelly instead! Oh my goodness it's amazing!

This is my go-to buttercream recipe for cupcakes and cakes, unless I'm decorating, in which case I sub the butter for shortening so that I can work with it and not worry about the "fat" getting to warm to hold its shape.      Not sure how much milk I use, I just add gradually until I have the right consistency.  And I usually double the recipe, so I have plenty, as I like LOTS of icing!

Awesome recipe.  What more is there to say?  I used it to frost yellow cupcakes (David's Yellow Cake recipe) and i love it.  The only part I hate about making this frosting is softening the butter.  When you don't have a stand mixer, your butter is not soft enought, and you're doing this all by hand, it's pain-staking work.  It's still a superb recipe, though!!

Very easy to make but it was too sweet for my family.  Even my 4 yr old didn't care for it.  Looked great but I won't make it again.

echoing what others have said, this recipe is WAY too sweet & is a bit grainy. i appreciate that it calls for all butter (as opposed to butter + shortening), but it just didn't do it for me.

Fabulous! I was looking for an all-butter frosting recipe and this will be my new go-to icing.  Light, but very flavorful. Do use the full amount of a good quality vanilla -- you won't be sorry! I scaled the recipe to make 32 servings so I could use a full pound of butter and a full 2 pounds of powdered sugar (didn't bother sifting and didn't have any lumpiness), just scaled back on the amount of milk a bit.  I had plenty to frost a 9" layer cake, 12 cupcakes, and a 5" cake and still had leftovers with that amount.

Fantatic basic recipe. Customise to your heart's delight. I've also made it with icing sugar instead of confectioners' sugar. Note that the measurements don't have to be exact but should be within this general range. Like people mentioned, the recipe doesn't make very much...I doubled it for 24 cupcakes.

I found this to be grainy - not smooth - not sure why.  After sitting for a while it crusts on top.  Used half & half instead of milk - probably better to use 1-1/2 T. instead of 2 T.  Recipe made enough to generously frost 12 cupcakes.  Taste is sweet, but nothing special.

I've been making this frosting for years and without a recipe.  I add about 1/4 tsp. almond extract and the flavor is wonderful.  This is the frosting my mother always made, she never measured, just put 1 stick of butter in a bowl, added a little milk, enough powder sugar to thicken and about 1 tsp. vanilla.

Very good!!  However, is *very* sweet and only makes enough to frost maybe a dozen cupcakes.  Make sure to double the recipe if you are making 24 cupcakes...

I followed the recipe to a T, and this icing was delicious.  However, I decided to follow the advice of several reviewers and double the recipe for a two-layer cake, and I ended up with enough leftover icing to cover another entire cake.

This is such a delicious, quick, simple frosting! It definately salvaged some brownies that were nearly disastrous for me! It was just perfect frost a 9x13 inch pan of brownies. All I had on hand was salted butter, but in terms of taste and texture, it did not seem to make any difference.

Love this icing! The best go-to icing recipe and tastes WAY better than the canned variety. I often add 1/2 t of lemon extract if I am using it on a citrus (orange or lemon), vanilla or berry flavored cake. Thank you!!

Lovely recipe.  Following others advice I tripled this recipe to ice a 3 layer chocolate cake.  It was enough for a thin crumb coat and a nice top coat.  I omited the vanilla and added 2 tbsps of Concentrated OJ.  I also reduced the milk in order to compensate for the added liquids.  This gave my icing a beautifully subtle orange flavor which complimented my chocolate cake wonderfully.  Wonderful consistency.  Heres a tip...if you don't have time to wait for your butter to soften, shred it with a cheese grater.  This really speads up the softening process:)

On the advice of Red Apple, I did half butter and half shortening. I added and added xxx sugar until things were getting pretty crumbly before adding any of the liquid. I think weather was working against me, and that buttercream roses are parked somewhere on the fringe of my patience's limits, if not my talent's STILL, the taste of this was good even having gone with half shortening. For a tasty buttercream, this is nice. For roses, I'm not the one to ask.

This is a great buttercream recipe. I always use the same one, but I decided to try a few others. This one is different because you use unsalted butter which results in a lighter, slightly less sweet flavor. I liked whipping this icing for an extra few minutes as well as the butter in the beginning, it is a keeper!

This was great, paired it with my mom's bisquick cake recipe from years ago. Everyone loved it. I did double the recipe, except I accidentially only used 1/2 C of butter and had to add another 1/4 of milk, it was great. Would definitely make again. I would recommend a double recipe for a 9x13 cake.

My first frosting attempt, and it was good. It does taste quite buttery, but thats probrably my fault I used the cheapest butter you can buy = ). I also made it in my food processor, and I doubled it. Next time I want to use the good butter and see how that goes!

It was awesome and delicious.  I doubled the recipe for a 13x9 cake and I had some left over.  Not too sweet and delicious.

This is so delicious! I used salted butter, as that is what I had, and half and half instead of milk. Hard to stop sneaking giant spoonfools into my mouth!

Very good icing.  I will definitely make it again.  I think it may have been a little sweet for some people but I really liked it.  It did not make nearly enough though.  I had to make three batches to ice one sheet cake.

I wanted some frosting for a cake my dad bought. The cake itself was delicious but I have an extreme sweet tooth so I just had to have frosting. I looked through many of the buttercream recipes here and finally came across this one. It is delicious! and lives up to it's name (i.e. It came together very quick!) Thanks for the recipe.

I had a frosting disaster yesterday when I tried to make seven-minute frosting that is cooked....big mistake. I needed something quick to save my husband's coconut bday cake, and this was the one. Instead of vanilla, I used coconut extract. I was even out of butter and used margarine and it was perfect!!! Love the consistency. I doubled the recipe and frosted the top and sides only of a nine-inch cake and had a little leftover. Yum!!!

I tried this recipe tonight after reading a bunch of them the other night.  My mission: ice 4 dozen cupcakes for a bake sale.  It really needed to work and it did, beautifully.  I give it 4 stars instead of five only because even after doubling the recipe I had several cupcakes left over un-iced, which was not the end of the world, but I would have liked to have been able to ice the rest of them a little bit heavier, too.  Other than that, it turned out perfect. I creamed the butter and confectioners sugar with an electric hand mixer, keeping it on low so I didn't overhead the butter.  I thought the proportion of sugar to butter was good, and I used salted butter because I like that salt taste to balance the sweetness.  After adding half the called for amount of vanilla extract and mixing some more, I divided it into four smaller bowls.  To two of the bowls I added the cream, plus a gel food coloring to make it pink in one.  In the other with the cream, I added nutmeg and cardomom to make a slightly spicy icing which was yummy!!  That one got no food coloring.  To one of the remaining bowls I added an organic peppermint extract and about a teaspoon (more or less) of peppermint syrup that I had on hand, and some green gel food coloring.  The last bowl got yellow gel food coloring, some organic lemon extract, and the juice of half of a lime (no lemons on hand).  I didn't use the cream in these last two bowls being mindful of other reviewers' complaints about it being too runny

I have used this twice now, and I got different results each time. The first time, I made a single batch and it turned out great. The second time, I doubled the recipe, and it turned out yellower than the first time and not as creamy. However, I liked the taste. Advice: Don't double the recipe!

A very light and fluffy frosting. Great for decorating. Instead of using milk, I used heavy whipping cream. Very tasty. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I tried this and didn't think it worked too well. It kind of seperated after beating it for only a few seconds. Looking back though, one of the reviews says how important it is to use real butter, and I think that I used some sort of light butter, so maybe that's where I went wrong. It tasted good regardless, and I did get some compliments on it.

I have been decorating cakes for about 9 years and I'm now moving away from using solid shorting.  This is a great icing and it held up really well with a detailed cake that I made.  I added a bit more sugar for consistency.  Health food this is not, but it is tasty! :D

SO GOOD!  This frosting is very smooth and silky!  I probably won't ever buy frosting from the store again, either!  I made 1 1/2 batches to cover a 9-inch round, double layer cake.  (1 batch wasn't enough to cover it)  I'm anxious to try to make it with chocolate next time!

LUSCIOUS RECIPE if you like it sweet. I could only eat one cupcake with about a teaspoon of icing. Of course - the kids love it. Good consistency - not thick at all - made it good for spreading.

I wish I could give this 10 stars.  Like some other reviewers, I have always used canned icing, just because making it myself intimidated me.  This was quick and easy, and so delicious!!  My daughter wanted an angel food cake for her birthday, and this icing was wonderful on an angel food cake.  People were coming back for more, and within minutes the whole cake was gone.  I will never purchase another can of icing again.  Thanks for sharing this!!

Wow. This is a great icing. I followed recipe exactly and it made my cake taste even better. I made a little einsteins cake for my daughter's birthday and froze the frosted cake in a cardboard box 2 weeks prior. I used a color paste to color the icing and it was perfect!! I am letting my kids decorate their own cake using this icing. Also, use REAL BUTTER like land o lakes. DO NOT use shortening or margarine. Wonderful!!!

I messed this up because I didn't have enough butter and substituted butter flavored shortening.  Taste was fine but didn't the yield was a little light for a cake.  Over all nice texture and flavor, however net time I will not skimp on the butter and I think this would be ideal

Better than mom's!! Don't tell her shhh.... I made the vanilla just as directed and it was perfect for icing and piping, it stacked between layers well. I cooked a 1/4 cup of cocoa and 1 and 1/2 tablespoon of butter for just a few min on low heat then cooled and whipped in for a light chocolate version and it was awesome too!!

Very pleased with how this turned out. I substituted half and half for the milk and flavored it with instant espresso In addition to the vanilla (2 tablespoons espresso crystals  activated in the 2 tablespoons of  half and half before adding to icing) for an amazing coffee flavored icing to go on a chocolate cake.  I can’t attest to piping it on, however it seemed thick enough to hold its shape for basic application . May have not been stiff enough for the fancy details, but if you’re a novice baker like me I think you’ll be happy with this recipe.

Nice and thick but i could still pipe cupcakes with it, slightly hard to work together because last time I made it, I used a KitchenAid beater and it didn't cream the butter; the butter just got all stuck up in it and the icing sugar didn't help but when I poured the milk in, it all came together!
DO NOT ADD TOO MUCH MILK; YOUR ICING WILL NOT HOLD!! It goes chunky.
I made it again last night, this time for cupcakes and no food coloring (turned it blue (I think?) last time for sugar cookies) and it was great! My dad ate FOUR cupcakes with icing. He waited for the icing. He wanted nothing but icing on his cupcakes.
It worked great and it's not too sweet! Will definitely be using again.

I don't know if it was just me and my family's taste buds, but either the recipe has too much vanilla or I added too much.

Great recipe ! You will definitely have to double or triple the recipe depending on what your using the icing for. I made a layer cake using 8 inch rounds and had to double it.!! TY

This was just what I was looking for - a creamy icing that doesn't include shortening (taste and mouth-feel of shortening-based icings is nasty).  As others recommended, I beat this at high speed for several minutes each time I added an ingredient.  I also added milk a little bit at a time.  Made enough to frost an 8" square cake.

Easy to make and always turns out perfectly. I reduce the sugar as my kids don't like too sweet, but this is simple, flawless and done in 5 minutes.

It worked great! It tasted so much better than the recipe I was using before!  The consistency was good, but I added a bit more powdered sugar just to meet my preference.  I would make it again! (I recommend using land-o-lakes butter)

Very disappointed with this frosting! It doesn't taste like a real buttercream. It tastes like you're just eating butter with sugar and oddly missing something. I added a few pinches salt and another 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and some chai spice to make it into a chai vanilla frosting. Despite that it's still way too sweet and has a grainy texture. Yuck. And I made this cake to give to someone now I'm embarrassed.

Not the best recipe. Should have doubled this recipe to frost 24 cupcakes. Didn’t make nearly enough. Annoying to have to redo the whole process. Taste was nothing spectacular. Will keep looking.

I agree with another advisor, it needs salt.  Great recipe.  Use salted butter or add a teaspoon of salt. I like sea salt for this.

This recipe is a good start but it definitely needs a few changes. It is way too sweet and I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup.  I also added cocoa to make it chocolate buttercream.  I added 3 tbsp very good unsweetened cocoa along with 1 tbsp instant espresso.  You can't really taste the espresso; it just brings out the chocolate flavor more and I added it to the milk so it dissolves before you add it to the butter and sugar.  I also used an extra tbsp for a total of 3 tbsp of milk for a smoother texture.  If it gets a little to runny, just add a little more powder sugar to stiffen it.  Also, be sure to sift both the powder sugar and cocoa.

This is a soft buttercream frosting that holds its shape if in the right temperature. I made the recipe exactly as instructed and it’ll be a frosting I’ll use again in the future. The flavor was light on vanilla though, and I think it could have benefited from a little salt. On my next round of sugar cookies, I’m going to use salted butter instead to see if it brings out some complexity in flavor. I didn’t have any issues with the frosting being too wet adding up to 30 drops of due to the frosting.

I made it just like the instructions and it was good, piped well onto our cupcakes, kids loved it, but it was a little too sweet for me and a little bland. To be fair, I have never had frosting or icing that I would rate at 5 stars. Maybe I just don't like the stuff!

Been looking for a recipe and this one was very good. Thanks!  It came out not too fluffy (next time I'll  beat it longer) and was easy to decorate with.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and let it whip for quite a while, possibly 5 minutes. Then I whipped it some more right before I scooped the frosting out of the bowl. I have made buttercream frosting before but did not like it because it had a strong butter taste. I think this frosting did not have that strong taste because the butter was whipped up fluffier than when I made it in the past. My frosting was a little grainy. It is possible my sugar was a little packed when I measured it.

I got so many compliments on this frosting.  It was delicious and it easily stayed in place on the sides of the cake. I made it for my kiddos 1st birthday party. I used a box cake and because the frosting was so on point, everyone thought it was all homemade. I will be using this again! Thank you!

I made this, fully intending to add color and pipe some cupcakes. I used vanilla paste, which contains flecks of vanilla beans. After beating it for several minutes, I realized how absolutely gorgeous it was with its creamy color and the vanilla beans, so I left it natural. It tastes as good as it

Followed some of the suggestions from others and I have to say i am amazed how creamy and delicious this frosting turned out. At time of beating the creamed butter, i made sure to incorporate and cream every single ingredients thoroughly every single time. It came out perfect consistency.

I may have had to make the recipe a couple times to make my cake, but I absolutely loved how simple it was to make, and it was quite smooth. It spread easily, didn’t tear the cake, and it tasted good. Thank you for the recipe.

Amazing! Usually I’m not a fan of buttercream, but needed some to decorate cookies. It taste great not to sweet or taste to buttery. Only problem is it didn’t make a lot so I’ll have to double the batch next time.

Never really made icing before but this one is easy and delicious. I refuse to make one with shortening so if you are like me you need to try this recipe. Play around with food colouring before you add all the milk so you don't make it too runny. The first time I made it I added the juice from a jar of maraschino cherries for flavour with a chocolate cake. It was ah-mazing!!

I doubled the recipe using four cups powdered sugar, one stick of butter, three tbs of vanilla and heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I just poured and blended the whipping cream till I had the consistency and quantity I wanted. Looked and tasted great. Very happy with it.

It's a good buttercream as far as American baking goes. I put in a little less sugar and a pinch of salt as I found it very sugary and sweet the first time. I made very sweet cupcakes so didn't want to make anyone sick with sweetness. It only got me a good eight cupcakes frosted nicely so I'd definitely maybe make more next time.  It went down really well and I'm definitely adding this to my faves

First time ever reviewing a recipe, but well worth 5 stars. In our mixer, this recipe was quite easy. Creamed the butter, added liquids, added powdered sugar....though we lessened the sugar to 30oz for a quadruple batch instead of 32oz that the recipe would have you use.  We used the whip attachment at the end to really fluff it and it came out lovely and very smooth. At room temp (meaning we didnt chill it) it was the perfect consistency for kids to use on cake without being too stiff and breaking the cake. The little I put in a ziplock to pipe letters worked really well too. 

It was plenty for 2 cakes of 2 layers each by quadrupling this recipe and with our lessened sugar amount was creamy and still sweet without hitting you over the head sweetness. (We are not fans of how overly sweet store or regular buttercream is and found lessing the sugar amount was great and sweet and you could still taste your cake!) We split the batch added 2 gel food colorings which both mixed in well. I will definately use this recipe again!

I will probably not make this again... I ended up with a slimy and grainy and too sugary mixture. The only substitution i made was a 1/4 teaspoon of peppermint extract in addition to the vanilla (because peppermint is so overpowering) ... Anyways the only reason it was ok was because my Cake itself was so bland. I made it into a mug cake...

This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I work as a cook at a retirement facility, and I use this for our many desserts we make for our residents. Of course, I make it in bulk, so it wields a lot, but making that much can be enough to frost an entire cake or be enough for multiple cupcakes. The most important thing you have to do, though, is NEVER EVER refrigerate homemade frostings (it solidifies when chilled, making it difficult to handle).
I use 1 lb. of butter, 8 cups sifted powdered sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla, and 2 Tbsp. milk for my recipe. I add a little more milk if necessary to make the consistency easier. It wields a big amount.

Good texture but waaay too sweet. Am nervous to use less sugar in case it changes the texture too much, but will have to find a different recipe.

First do not add more powdered sugar to try to thicken it. It is sugar people. Sugar only makes it runnier.
My only complaint is that there is too much vanilla extract. I did cut it in half (the whole recipe) because I only had a few cupcakes to frost. The 3/4 tsp of vanilla, for half the recipe, overpowered the frosting.
Other than that this had a beautiful consistency. It is a keeper but with less vanilla extract.

Tastes just like an icing from a bakery I used to shop at back in my home town.  Everyone if you like the taste of almond in your dessert then try adding about 1/2 tsp. to the icing.  It is really good.
Thanks for this recipe.

Really good recipe. I would add just a little less sugar though. It was quite sweet, but overall awesome recipe and I would totally use again!

I made this and it is good. I like the consistency. It covered 12 cupcakes. The only thing I didn’t like was that it was way to sugary for me.

This was delicious! The only change I made was that I used cream instead of milk. I have tried so many different buttercream recipes, and this one is the best.

I've never thought of making Butter Creme icing before. I was tryna find reasonable prices in stores, but then I thought, why do ALL of that if I'm making everything else from scratch. I'm looking forward to continue making everything as I should. Thanks!!!!

It was good but it made barely any. Not ideal for when you’re needing to ice a large quantity.

I love the recipe, it is fantastic! The only problem I have is that it is not enough, I had to double and sometimes triple it to be able to frost everything.

came out great and I was able to make my sons pokemon theme birthday cake over in brazil. I doubled the recipe 3xs total to finish the whole two tier cake. What I really liked was how it didn't make the inbetween layers to thick or nor was it to sweet. just right and it held up to brazil heat quite heartily

Absolutely delicious frosting. I agree that you have to double the recipe to get enough frosting for a few dozen cupcakes. I got rave reviews from many people after they tried my cupcakes. Thank you!

Loved it on an angel food cake, although it barely made enough to frost it.

I get requests for this from people all of the time!  Here's the key to success whip the butter before adding any other ingredients. 
 I mean beat it for a solid two - three minutes on high before you add anything else.  ALWAYS sift the 10x sugar first.  Use a quality vanilla and double the amount of vanilla.  Also, save the milk for last.  Sometimes you don't even need to add it.

And - double the recipe.

I have been making this for 60 yrs & have added almond, rum or any flavoring desired.
A drop of Lemon or orange oil works good but always use a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk.

I had pretty much given up on making my own frosting. I tried this recipe, and it turned out great. I actually substituted orange extract for the vanilla. It is yummy! I read another post that said it was only enough for 10 cupcakes, so I doubled the recipe. I made 24 cupcakes and had plenty left over. I froze it to use later.

Easy, yummy, and kid-friendly! I used it to decorate rainbow cupcakes that I made with my little sister. Had to make 1 and a half batches, which was enough to decorate 18 cupcakes.

Very creamy, thick and fluffy. Not too sweet. I put it right into a ziploc bag and piped a beautiful swirl with it. I double the recipe and covered 12 cupcakes heavily with it and I still have a ton leftover. I think one batch would have been good, but one of the reviews before mine made me think it wouldn’t have been enough. Will definitely make it again!

This was my first time making frosting from scratch. I loved this frosting! I added a little purple to it and paired it with a carrot cake. The only issue I had with this recipe is that it only made enough to put a really thin layer between the cakes and a little bit on top. I was looking forward to having a beautiful pastel purple cake to show my husband. I can barely call it a naked cake lol. But it tastes amazing!!!

Sooo good. Easy and simple to make. I didn't add milk, had a tiny bit of whipping cream left in fridge so used a splash of that and a few drops of almond extract and a tsp vanilla. Accidentally melted the butter but after mixing everything together with hand mixer, I put it in the fridge to harden up some. I couldn't stop snacking on it! Really need to double recipe for a two layer cake.. now I know. Thank you for recipe! Yum!

I gave this four stars because of the substantial changes I made. First, I added only half the amount of sugar the recipe called for. I also added quite a bit of salt (1-2 tsp). I didn't want my frosting to be overwhelmingly sweet and found that the salt helped bring out the sweetness of the frosting considering I put half the sugar in. I also added a teaspoon of almond extract. With these modifications, the frosting turned out perfectly sweet and fragrant.

I love that this is super light. I was worried it was going to be SUPER sweet and heavy, but it is light with just a touch of sweetness even though it is made with 2 cups of confectioner's sugar. This will be great on the GF cake I am making tomorrow.

I’ve tried a few recipes and this is my go to! 
Simple, quick and a crowd pleaser. 
I have tried adding heavy or whipping cream instead of milk and it does increase the fluffiness. But mostly I stick to the original.
 I’d say The only down fall, according to my wife, is the mess I make when I’m done.

I doubled the recipe to generously frost 24 cupcakes. I used margarine rather than butter, increased the sugar by one cup, added a dash of salt and half a tsp more vanilla. The margarine was so soft it didn’t require any milk. Loved it.

delicious! I didnt have vanilla, so I used torani sugar free vanilla syrup, excellent result. Makes me wonder how using other syrups as flavor would work? Guess I'll have to try.

It turned out okay.  I wasn't a huge fan and neither was one of the kids but it was better than the store bought stuff.  I 2.5x'd the recipe and had just enough to frost a 3 layer cake but had none left over for piping any decorations.  I might have liked it more if I had added an extract other than vanilla...

I doubled recipe except for powdered sugar (only used 3 cups) 
 & added 1/3 cup Cocoa Powder to frost a 9X13 Chocolate Cake.  Be sure to cream the butter for a full 3-4 minutes first!

All I can say is yum , other reviews say it’s too sweet but my six year old totally approves of it for her birthday cupcakes to be frosted with this icing  and I have never tried making butter cream icing , I did not even have a sieve for the confectioners sugar so used as is ! Thank you for sharing this recipe!
Made this recipe again and it turned out perfect, it’s a great recipe !

I doubled the recipe but used less powdered sugar (approx  1.25 - 1.5 C.) because I didnt want it too sweet. It was delicious and everyone loved it with lemon cupcakes  topped with raspberries!

This makes a very small amount, so I would suggest doubling or even tripling for a cake, even a small cake. You can always freeze any leftover frosting. This is really good and does taste very close to the bakery cake frosting. My daughter who doesn't like sweets even said it's really good! I did add some himalayan white salt, I always add some to frosting. I will keep this recipe and would highly recommend.

I didn't use the milk after about the third time. if needed add butter or milk to get the consistency just right. a little too runny for cupcakes.

Turned out better than expected!!! My niece loves store bought sugar cookies with clouds of colorful frosting. She loved this frosting with the no roll sugar cookies from “all recipes.” Thanks to you my niece thinks I am a baking genius.

Fantastic buttercream. I usually think buttercream frostings from many stores are too sweet and lack depth of a really good frosting. I made this twice - I followed the original recipe faithfully the first time and the second time I substituted heavy whipping cream for milk = FANTASTIC. My only edit.

OK so i made this for a cake but it was   to sweet so i would put only one cup of sugar. I put a little bit more butter in to.  ( I think it was like 4-5 tablespoons)  But other than that it was a good  recipe. No recipe  is going to be perfect. Just keep cooking and keep getting better! :)

I made the recipe as is, but found that I needed a bit more milk to get the consistency I wanted for a Russian ball tip. It is a great frosting recipe!

I really did like this recipe. I would recommend doubling it since this recipe will not make enough frosting for  24 cupcakes. I also feel  that it is not necessary to use unsalted butter. salted butter will give a nice contrast to the sweetness of the sugar, but not too much that it tastes bad.

Excellent! I don't change a thing. This is my go to recipe for frosting. I don't buy store bought anymore. Great taste and consistency. Thank you for sharing!

Very tasty.  I wanted a recipe that didn’t use shortening, so this was perfect.

I have made this many times as a backdrop and layer filling for my grandkids special  fondant birthday cakes .  I had to triple this recipe for a 2 tier cake with thin frosting middle & very thin outer shell ( just enough to hold it all together for fondant ). So the recipe as stated would not give very much frosting at all .  The taste is good a bit more sugary than others I have made , so if I was making for adults maybe I would choose another , but with kids party's they always love it  ! I cut back a bit on the milk & and just a bit shy of the sugar amount  .

I made this frosting to go on cupcakes. It was delicious! So much better than store bought frosting! I only used 1 tablespoon of milk because I used more than 3 drops of food coloring (appx. 5) to make bright pink frosting. This recipe was only enough to frost 10 out of the 18 cupcakes I baked, but well worth doubling the ingredients next time for a larger batch. Also, I made it all by hand (I don't have a hand mixer or counter mixer) and it still came out really smooth.

Quick, easy, and tastes great. Will be making it  again for sure. If making a two layered cake make sure to triple.

The recipe was great.  I tweaked it a little.  I added 2 heaping tablespoons of Crisco Shortening. Instead of unsalted butter, I used 1 stick of Land O Lakes salted butter and a little over 2 heaping tablespoons of vanilla (I love vanilla).  Sometimes I add 2 to 3 dashes of cinnamon.  I didn't this time.  Adding the Crisco Shortening will give it a lighter texture.  You may need to add additional powdered sugar based on how thick you want the icing to be.

I made the icing, the consistency was good until I put the milk in, I don’t recommend using milk, it seperated and turned the icing grainy.

The frosting came out AMAZING. I used margarine, because that's what we use in our house, I sifted the sugar, creamed the margarine and added 1 tsp vanilla extract at the end. I don't know if it was because of the margarine, but I didn't even need to add the milk (which would've been almond milk). It came out airy and fluffy but held its shape perfectly!

I changed the milk into heavy whipping cream, added a bit of strawberry extract and added extra vanilla. The frosting was almost too sugary, and I could only frost 14 cupcakes. It is still a great frosting though, and I enjoyed my 14 frosted cupcakes

I made this to use on a cake for my daughters school.  I followed the other reviews and made sure the milk and flour mixture were cool before mixing all together.  I mixed it for 5 minutes.  Everyone loved it.  It’s going to be my normal icing recipe moving forward.

It works perfectly! I've been struggling to find a good buttercream recipe and this is great! I do suggest toning down the amount of vanilla used as it gave to much of a strong flavor

Pretty good recipe! This recipe makes enough to fill one piping bag. Just a tip: mix with an electric mixer until the icing forms stiff peaks. Then it’s easier to frost cupcakes

I have made this several times, and it is exactly what I want a buttercream to be. The most recent time I used coconut milk instead of regular milk, and that was even better! It added a wonderful richness of flavor. Yes, this frosting is extremely sweet.

Really loved this icing - used pure vanilla which worked perfectly for my cupcakes. Since I'm not a die-hard decorator, I'd rather have a less white frosting and pure vanilla.

Fabulous! I'm going to admit my first time making it wasn't that great... It was grainy... And I didn't sift the powdered sugar... .. But I tried it again following the recipe exactly as written! And we have a winner!! I  can bake a lot and make all kinds of goodies, but I have NEVER been able to make frosting... Until now ??

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! I Just made this frosting and it’s the best butter cream frosting I’ve ever had. Could totally be used professionally. I read the recipe, then I  read the comments and followed the instructions however, IT IS VERY VERY important to whip the butter well so it’s light and fluffy, then sift the powder sugar in to the butter, mix with hand mixer till blended then add the vanilla, mix some more, then add the milk - BUT for me,  I doubled the recipe and I only added 1/2 TBSP milk and it was absolutely perfect. After adding the milk, I continued to whip the frosting with a hand mixer about another 4 or so minutes till it was fluffy it turned out so good, I will never need another recipe, this one is amazingly fabulous.

Just made this icing for my cupcakes and it turned out beautiful. I tweaked a little of the recipe and used salted butter and a little extra vanilla. Other then that the recipe was exact. Thank you for adding this awesome recipe. I'll be using this one for sure in the future.

It started out great...looked good. But as soon as I added the milk it turned into soup. I would have loved it without the milk. I'll probably use this recipe without the milk

I didn't measure exactly on everything but the powdered sugar and I found that using 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar works best. I most definitely will make this recipe again.

This recipe came out well. I confess I had to triple it to make enough to just barely be able to frost and decorate a quarter sheet cake. No bottom border. I did sub 1 half cup of shortening to make up butter shortage. Came out fine .Will use again.

This could not have been easier and was pretty tasty.  You can use this a great base and add almond extract or other flavoring or colors.  We used it to frost gingerbread cookies. It was very good for being so easy a monkey could make it.

I used this icing on “Rosemary shortbread cookies” I’d made without rosemary. They turned out amazing, and the icing dried as another reviewer had stated. Overall great recipe!
Update: I used this to decorate a cake for a college football championship game party, and it also turned out amazing!! Very easy to pipe and adjust to the correct thickness!

My girls and I made it exactly according to recipe. We doubled it - a MUST. It was the perfect amount, I was so glad we made that call.
The girls each took their own bowls and added whatever color they chose. We frosted mini chocolate cupcakes and I was so happy with the taste results. This will be my go to recipe from here on out.

I added merange powder like I'm used to when using Crisco. I'm not sure on the taste as it has a salty after taste, but the consistency of the receipt is very soft and fluffy. I think I would love this if I didn't try to change it on the first go around.

You may need to make a double batch!  I replaced a half teaspoon of vanilla with almond flavoring, which my husband declared to be amazing.  This allowed an adequate amount of icing for 12 cupcakes iced in a basic manner, but I did not pile the icing high for a fancy presentation.

Did not care for this at all. Sweet beyond repair. A waste of good organic butter and vanilla. I can’t get the taste of it out of my mouth.

Very happy! My first experience with buttercream, and it tasted amazing! I used a little less powdered sugar, since too much sweetness hurts my teeth, and I used strawberry extract with a little splash of vanilla, but that’s only because I was using it on chocolate cupcakes! Sooo good! I also made it in a 3x batch, and I didn’t load up on the frosting, so I’ve got waaaay too much! I hope it keeps in the fridge well with plastic wrap on it until I make another batch of cupcakes!

You would need to either double or triple the recipe if you were making a cake. Makes about 2 cups maybe 3.

Didn't make any changes. Only downside is that I could feel the confectioners' sugar just a tiny bit if I were to taste the icing by itself.

This is the first buttercream icing I have made..It was easy to make and tasted delicious !! I had a little less than 2 cups of the powdered sugar but it was the perfect sweetness...My family loved it...Definitely a keeper for all of our cupcakes and cakes in the future.
 THANK YOU !!!

I just baked this and oh my! It is so light and fluffy and yummmmmmy.
I didn't add nuts (I'm waiting on a crown for a molar) and just added the chocolate chips into the mix.

This was way too buttery.  I even added more milk and another cup of confectioners sugar to kill the taste but it did not work.  It tasted like I was eating butter.  If you try this recipe, maybe start with a couple tablespoons of butter before using the whole stick.

It's a great recipe I accidentally added more milk  than it said it is a little extra creamy, and was a sweet frosting over all, but as a 13 year old I think it was quite easy and tastes good so if you don't have frosting make it or if u  want to make it home made good luck it taste great ??

I followed the recipe as written and it was great!  I did need to add a little more powdered sugar after adding the food coloring.  Otherwise, an excellent recipe that I plan to use again.

I was searching for a recipe that didn't have shortening or margerine in it. This was perfect! It's important to beat the butter until fluffy and THEN add the sifted sugar and then after the milk beat for at least 5 mins.  It turned out so fluffy and light. I doubled the recipe for my needs and it was perfect.

This Recipe is one of my VERY VERY favorites. I most recently used it for my sisters birthday cake, and I had to double the recipe twice to be able to frost the whole cake, two 6 inch (I think) cakes stacked on top of two 9 inch. The flavor of the cake is wonderful, and it colors well, if you put enough food coloring. I found that 3 or more drops works best, if you have any less it looks grainy. Like I said, it’s a small recipe, but it tastes good enough to quadruple it. It’s easy too, so it’s not a huge sacrifice to make that much. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone in need of an easy delicious buttercream.

I will try it again. It wasn’t very fluffy, was a bit flat and grainy. Followed the directions. Next time I will try a different attachment.

I used a 1/2 cup measuring cup and sifted the sugar directly into the butter. Each 1/2 cup was mixed on low speed and blended well before the next 1/2 cup was added. I added an additional 1/2 cup of powdered sugar because I felt the mixture was thin. Even with that addition, the frosting was still light and fluffy. The vanilla was very strong so I will decrease it to 1 tsp next time. I had more than enough frosting for 24 cupcakes and was able to slather it on. (I didn't pipe it.)

I replaced half the vanilla with banana extract and that was the perfect amount of banana flavour. It also needed a bit more icing sugar to get the consistency I needed.

This is the easiest and best recipe to use that does not involve crisco.  Not only is it easy, it's delicious and taste just like it was bought from a bakery. It sits well in the fridge and is best the day after you make it. I added raspberry preservatives to the mixture.  It made an excellent tangy + fruity frosting. Absolutely delicious. I highly recommend adding a little extra flavor of preserves to the recipe for a delicious twist.

This frosting is AMAZING! We made a homemade chocolate wedding cake, topped with this frosting for about 15 people. It was a huge hit! Everyone was asking for seconds as well as the recipe. The frosting covered the cake so perfectly that no one could tell it was chocolate underneath. I doubled the recipe and substituted condensed milk for regular milk. It was so rich and creamy. Just be prepared to do a bit of taste testing while you're making it, it's impossible to resist!

I’d say 4.5 stars because it was really good, just a little too sweet (but that’s just my opinion).

I followed the recipe exactly as it is. I doubled the amount of I ingredients to use for 24 cupcakes. I had some left. It was a bit sweet for me. I am a particular case though. I am from Peru. I am not used to super sweet desserts but I think it was tasty and easy to work with :)

The consistency was wonderful -- airy and fluffy and easy to pipe with. Almost as fluffy as whipped cream, but much easier to control. The trade off is that it's EXTREMELY sweet, like so sweet it kind of made my head hurt, like you're basically eating spoonfuls of powdered sugar sweet, and it doesn't have a lot of flavor. Unless you count sweet as a flavor -- then it has a LOT of flavor. I'm still going to bookmark this recipe in case I want to try to tweak it to my own tastes, though, because the texture is just so nice.

This is a fantastic recipe for piping!! The only thing I did different was double the recipe. No need for changes or substitution. Beat the butter extremely well, when you think you beat it enough, beat it some more. Do the same after you add the powdered sugar. The more you beat it the fluffier it becomes! Awesome!!

I made this in a food processor--creamed the butter for ~ 1 min. before adding sugar, then processed with the sugar, milk (only used 1 tsp half and half), and vanilla for 3-5 min. I used salted butter and was complimented by a party guest for the hint of salt to cut the sweetness. It frosted a 9X13 sheet cake (not too thickly, but adequately).

I was surprised this called for 2 Tbs milk. It seemed like a lot. My frosting came out too thin so I had to add more confectioners sugar. It was still too thin but I didn’t want to add too much extra sugar and change the flavor. Did anyone else have this issue? Any ideas about what I might have done wrong? In the future I think I’ll just add the milk a little at a time. Also maybe I needed to beat it longer? It tasted amazing!

I ended up adding 5 drops of food coloring and it came out great. The key is really making sure your butter is still slightly cold. Not shiny but matte. It tastes great. Not too sweet but sweet enough.

I struggle with anything baking related but this frosting was delicious!  Had a little bit of powdered sugar taste to it; perhaps I under-mixed something.  
I'll definitely try it again.

Love this icing! It has a very silky texture.  Have tried it on vanilla, strawberry and chocolate cupcakes and it was great on all of them. If you’re piping keep in mind that the butter softens after being at room temperature too long and you may have to chill it on and off as you pipe.

This is the perfect frosting recipe. It’s light and fluffy and not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. I’ve tried many but this is my favorite. It does have a professional quality to it and it was quite easy!! Loved it!!

My go to icing for almost everything.  I did do some personal taste changes though,  I use 1 1/4 stick butter plus a dash of salt and adjust the amount of the other ingredients.  Instead of beating I whip it so it ends up very light,  fluffy and buttery (this is not for decorations though).  This is enough to do a thin layer of icing on a 2layer 8" round cake. 
I do use salted butter(no real flavor change)  and change the flavors for what I need instead of only vanilla.
  If  the icing is too sweet add a bit of table salt to even out the sweet taste.

I tripled this to do a double layer 9" round cake it doesn't make very much. I like butter but split the butter amount in half and used shortening for the other portion. Cuts the heavy butter taste if your not a fan like us and keeps it very creamy. I also added a bit more vanilla (not extract) and a bit more icing sugar to thicken up. I use only 1 tbsp of  milk at a time while mixing as it whips quickly. Also on a bakers note ALWAYS pre sift your icing sugar to avoid any lumps

Used some of the review suggestions regarding whipping the ingredients thoroughly to allow air to form in butter.  Turned out excellent.

Very good frosting. I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and 1/4 tsp of salt (for double the recipe) which seemed to take away the almost too sweet taste (and I love sweet!). I needed about 6x this recipe for a 3 layer 9” round cake.

I added a bit of lemon juice instead of vanilla extract and it came out perfectly! Amazing when paired with vanilla cupcakes and lemon curd.

Great frosting and flavour. Easy to make. Taste is way superior to storebought whipped oil frostings.... and kids loved this icing but scraped the store bought frosting off another person's cupcakes at the party. 

As another reviewer said. You may will need to double the batch if you are doing a 2 layer cake. 

Also great tip by another reviewer that its super important to cream the butter for 4 mins. Then after adding the sugar mix for another 4mins. The texture and taste really does change after that mixing time!!

A bit too sweet but it was fine. Sugar has to be a really soft powder so you don't feel it in the frosting.

Great recipe! I used it to frost a cake made from two 9" pans, so I doubled the recipe based on the reviewers' comments. I frostedin between the layers and all of the exterior and had about a half cup of frosting leftover. It mixed up and frosted beautifully. This recipe is going in to my tested keeper file.

It was easy to make, but it tasted too sugary and wasn't enough to frost 12 cupcakes. The consistency looked a little watery and was runny.

It was OK not like some of the better bakery frostings. What it tastes like is butter and sugar, not some fantastic frosting. Its totally fine for a casual cake,  but I'll keep searching for that "perfect frosting".

Best buttercream frosting ever.  Perfect sweetness without the heavy butter taste.  Beating the butter until fluffy in the beginning is key.  Thank you for sharing!

I cut the recipe in half as i didn't need a lot.  I used heavy whipping cream and added 3 or 4 tbsp of whipping cream.  So I'much better.  Just eyeball the cream to what level of creaminess you want.

Made exactly to the recipe, except I slowly added milk and found I only needed a single tablespoon. I imagine on a dry day I'd need more. I made a double batch, then split it into three parts. I colored each to my liking, then plopped them into Gladware containers and put them in the fridge overnight. The next day I took them out about two hours before icing. Then, when they were at room temp, I mashed them up really well with a fork. The frosting pumped out smoothly from the bag with a no.2 tip, and I had JUST enough for 24 cupcakes (remember: double batch). Tasted perfect with chocolate cake.

Awesome!  As the other reviews said, you have to beat it for quite a while.  My kitchen looks like I was trying to remake Scarface, but it was worth it.  The amount works well to cover one regular sized bunt cake.

Great recipe! My only advice is follow the recipe and make sure you whip the frosting for the right amount of time! Too little will make it melt and too much will break it!

What a great recipe! I used this for a coconut cake so instead of using vanilla extract, I substituted coconut extract. Also, I only used 1.5 cups of sugar as I found that was sweet enough for my liking. Definitely double the recipe to have enough for a cake.

Edit: Nov 5, 2019
Use only 1 tablespoon of milk

Great recipe!  Made it to use on a cake for a gender reveal party!  Definitely a hit.  I will say though that if you have someone who doesn’t like a lot of sweet,  this is not the frosting for them!  It held tint well and piped well.  Also, to frost a 9”, four layer cake took four batches of frosting.

We loved this for a white cake we made.  Made a couple double batches a day ahead then added  a little extra milk and whipped it up again in the mixer for a few minutes so it glided right onto our cake!  My son used it for a cake contest for his Cub Scout to Boy Scout crossover banquet.  Judging is tonight, and I think he’s got a good shot at the win!!

Creamy and delicious!  The only change I made was using part salted butter, and part unsalted, based on what I had on hand.
I agree with those who have mentioned doubling the recipe, depending on what you’re making.     
This is a winner!

I’m definitely in the minority’s, based on the reviews here but I would not make this again as it’s written. I followed the recipe as written and the consistency turned out terrible, very grainy and loose. I had to double the amount of powdered sugar to get a decent consistency and still

Made as per recipe except added a little less than 2/3 cup Guittard Red Dutch Processed Cocoa so added a little bit more milk.  DELICIOUS AND FLUFFY!  Yum.   

Iced a dozen cupcakes, had a little leftover and will mix with peanut butter, nuts, etc. to make a lazy 'fudge'.  :)   Thanks for posting this great recipe!

Loved this frosting. My friend and I made this frosting in the hopes of putting it on a cake. Of course after tasting it we put as much frosting as we could all over the cake! It was so good I wanted some just to eat by itself but alas the cake needed it more than me. I will certainly be making this again in the very soon foreseeable future.

I used this frosting to frost a box mix.  The texture was perfect.  It was a little sweet for my taste.. But what did I expect, using 2 cups of powdered sugar!  Overall, it was worked just as the recipe said it would.  I used salted butter, and added a couple of shakes of salt.  Just to cut some of the sweetness.  Hubby thought it was perfect.

This is an amazing recipe. When I make frosting it always somehow turns way to buttery or just into a lumpy mess but I love this recipe. All I did was add a bit of extra milk and it was the perfect consistency. However, I recommend doubling the recipe I I definetly didn't end up with enough frosting.

Not the delicious butter cream frostings that I remember, but it was beautiful and easy and easy to keep everything on hand. I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and will need every bit of it. 
I'd only make this again because I had everything on hand. It is better than the vanilla frosting in a can but not by much

The taste is so good.  I'm not a big fan of canned frosting or icing as it can be way too sweet for me, but sub salted butter for unsalted and it will tone the sweetness down in this and it is quite tasty.  However, I doubled this recipe and I doubt I'll have enough for cookie decorating with 25-30 cookies.  We'll see.  It really does not make a lot for what goes in it.

Also, make sure you have a reliable mixer.  My old hand mixer died in the middle of making this, so I had to finish it off by hand.  My arm is still sore.  The mixer is your friend.

I will definitely use this again. I needed a cookie icing for Christmas cookies. Initially I followed the recipe as provided. If I were icing a cake, it would have been perfect - very creamy, light and easy to spread or pipe. Since I was icing cookies, I needed one that was more dense and would “set up”. Added 1 more cup of powered sugar. BTW, I sifted the powdered sugar for a smooth consistency.

Easy and delicious!  I added Coco to make a chocolate. I love this recipe because it was easy and I always have those ingredients on hand. 
 I would double it next time though because it wasn't enough to cover two round cakes.

Awesome!!!!! I quadrupled the recipe and piped 6 dozen cupcakes. I measured then sifted the flour and used 1-2 tablespoons of milk.  I mixed for a total of 8 minutes. Great frosting.

This is the first time I have ever been able to pipe any homemade frosting. I used Earth's Best Soy free butter. Because I colored the frosting with beet juice to make it a pale pink, I omitted the milk. Tasted delicious. Definitely a keeper.

Loved this recipe! I was looking for an icing that didn't require shortening, and this one was great! I had to triple the recipe for a two-layer cake, but it was worth it. This will be my go-to for future cakes.

Light and delicious. I wasn't paying attention and creamed butter and sugar together at first, vs adding butter to creamed sugar, and it still worked out ok. Very light and just the right amount of sweet.

Very good recipe.  Made a double batch to frost 24 cupcakes, based on another review, but had half left when I was finished.  I think there is enough in the original amount for 24 cupcakes if you have regular sized cupcakes and don't overload them with frosting.

I used the vanilla buttercream and also tried 1 cup cocoa with a double batch. Yummy! Great for pipping-may have to add a little extra powdered sugar if it’s to soft. Really good recipe that won’t disappoint.

I used this frosting to decorate my own wedding cake. It came out beautifully, and tasted delicious! Everyone raved about how much better it was than a bakery cake's frosting. Definitely a keeper! I tripled the recipe to frost a three layer 6in cake. I did a crumb coat, some between the layers, and then the top coat.

My go-to recipe for cupcakes and cakes. Always a big crowd pleaser. Tastes great, looks fantastic, pipes well and holds its shape.

I love this recipe because it was super easy, quick, and tastey. I used salted butter because that's what I had in my fridge and it came out perfect.

Tastes really good, but when I made it with the amount of milk specified in the recipe, it turned out too runny and didn't work for decorating cupcakes. Tried with only a splash of milk and it turned out perfect! Also tried it with salted butter and it made it tasted less sweet, which was nice. Had to times the recipe x4 in order to decorate 24 cupcakes.

Excellent recipe! I've tried a few Buttercream recipes and this one was by far the best. It's light and fluffy and tastes amazing. Not a complicated recipe either. Wonderful!

I give it 4 stars. It may be my taste but seemed slightly  gritty, a bit too sweet, (but still taste good), and slightly too soft. For one cake you will need to quadruple  the recipe for a 3 layer cake with upper and lower edge border piping.

Excellent recipe. Absolutely whip the butter for several minutes before adding sugars etc. You can use this base recipe, and add additional flavors (coconut, chocolate, etc.). My mother's tip was always to heat the milk before you add it - it makes the frosting even more luscious looking.

I used organic vanilla almond milk. This was delicious on top of a 2 layer chocolate cake. I had plenty to frost between the layers and the rest of the cake. It's not a thick frosting, but is simple to make, easy to spread, and absolutely delicious. A great compliment to chocolate cake!

This is definitely the best buttercream icing I have ever used and I have tried several.  Great decorating icing and delicious as well.  This is a keeper.  I read several notes from people who used this recipe and incorporated their slight modifications, i.e., whipping the butter well before and after sifting the powdered sugar and adding 1 cup at a time.

It's an amazing butter cream frosting. I have been making it ever since I got into baking. The only thing I change is the amounts depending on the number of cakes or cupcakes I'm baking.

Very good and easy to make with ingredients most have on hand. My son helped me make it for his birthday cake. It is a small batch - just enough to frost a double layer cake lightly.

Wow - what a great recipe! This buttercream is perfect and will be my go-to recipe from here on out. I made this for a birthday cake on which I piped ombre rosettes. I needed to make 5x the recipe in order to cover the 9 in. round cake adequately. This recipe isn't sickeningly sweet like other buttercreams can be. Also, I used regular vanilla extract (not the clear vanilla extract) and the frosting was still pretty white!

I made this and it turned out nice. I added a fourth tsp of almond extract with vanilla and a pinch of salt so the flavor was great! I doubled the recipe and was able to frost and decorated a two layer cake. Next time I will add more conf. Sugar,  less milk. I believe the piping would hold up better and look sharper. Good go - to butter cream.

The taste is very good; however, compared to recipe i used to utilize it was very thin imo. For a double layer 8.5" make a double batch. Adjust accordingly if using liquid vs dry coloring. Again very tasty.

Made this, this past weekend. Very easy to make. The only thing I would change is not so much Confectioners Sugar. I felt the 2 cups made it too sweet. So on my next batch that I made, I took it to 1 1/2 cups. And it was perfect. Also you cannot put this icing in the refrigerator. I put mine in there to hold until I was ready to use it, and it turned into a weird clumpy mixture. And was only in there for maybe an hour. Other than that. It is a great quick recipe!

I made this for cupcakes! I ended up adding way more sugar and only 1 tsp of milk. I did t have any vanilla so I used just a tad of coconut and butter extract and it was amazing! You do have to keep beating/whipping for several minutes to get a stiff "peak" consistency...but, overall I loved it!

I had to quadruple this recipe to get enough to frost and flower a 9X13 cake. The frosting was delicious and an absolute DREAM to pipe with. 

A few tips:
-You really have to whip the butter for a good 3-5 minutes before adding anything else.
-Sifting the powdered sugar and also adding it in small batches makes a HUGE difference also.
-I did add less milk because I knew that I would be adding liquid food coloring later and did not want the food coloring to make the consistency too runny, so keep that in mind if you plan to color this frosting. If you are using gel food coloring that will not water down your frosting I would recommend using the full amount of milk.

 I had multiple people come up to me after this cake was dished up asking me what made this frosting so darn good. I had to tell them that it's basically just butter and sugar - and those basics work!! 

This will be my go-to frosting recipe from now on!

Great recipe. I made this exactly as written. 
It was easy and the result is a beautifully fluffy frosting that was really easy to pipe onto my cupcakes. 
For some reviewers who are not getting fluffy results, you may want to try beating your butter a *lot* more before beginning to add the sugar. 
My only criticism is that is is a little too sweet for my tastes - even for frosting.

This was perfect, we added prickly pear juice and it made the best frosting I've ever had. Would definitely recommend.

Delicious, but too thin for me. I think adding the milk was the main reason.

This is the same recipe my mother used in the 50's and 60's when I was a child. It was on the box of the powdered sugar. Always a winner and you can change the flavor to anything you like including making it a chocolate frosting by melting some bakers chocolate and adding it once it is fluffy.  You can also add food coloring to make it even more special.

The Quick and Almost Professional Buttercream frosting was delicious. It has a nice, creamy texture which made it easy to decorate my cake and the flavor was really good! I will make it again and again!

So easy and so quick to make, I love this buttercream recipe! It's easy to adjust the flavor, consistency, and the color without a lot of hassle. I've used it for simple cake decorations, and for more intricate designs. and it holds up very well for both. It forms a nice crust, and I had no problems with it melting or getting to soft while piping it (even on a warm summer day!). I've also gotten a lot of compliments on how it tastes---I usually add slightly less powdered sugar, a good hefty pinch of salt to offset the sweetness, and heavy whipping cream in place of the milk (I highly recommend doing this, not only for flavor, but it also makes the frosting really smooth and easy to spread/pipe). It holds color very well, but will not be a "true white" frosting due to the butter (but it's pretty and tastes good, so who cares?). Thank you, I have used this recipe multiple times, and I will continue to do so! Note: to crumb coat, fill, frost, and decorate a 9" layer cake: 3 cups butter,  10-11 cups powdered sugar, 1/2-2/3 cup heavy cream, 3 tbsps vanilla, 1 tsp salt.

Easy, easy, easy! A nice rich tasting frosting. This recipe makes about 2 cups, a perfect amount for 13x9" desserts/sheet cakes that I frost as I don't like a thick layer of frosting.

Whipped the butter for a few minutes in my mixer til light and fluffy. After adding other ingredients, whipped for a few more minutes. Also added about a scant 1/2 teaspoon of salt since I use unsalted butter.. Doubled the recipe for a 13X9 cake which gave me a little more than 1/4 inch thickness of frosting. Delicious.

Fluffy and delicious!  I made this recipe exactly as written (with servings adjusted), and it was exactly what I was looking for to frost some white cupcakes that my boys decorated with candy, mini chocolate chips and sprinkles.  I was concerned that there wouldn't be enough frosting for 12 standard size cupcakes after reading one of the reviewers comments indicating that she barely had enough to frost 10 cupcakes so I adjusted to 12 servings (additional half recipe); this made a lot of frosting so I think I would have been fine making the original amount (8 servings) to frost each cupcake with a good amount of frosting. I find that a lot of bakery cupcakes have way too much frosting which I end of scraping off and throwing away; I like enough frosting to add some sweetness and creaminess but not overwhelm the cake.  This will be my "go to" buttercream frosting.

Dee licious icing.  Great consistency, nice and fluffy, great flavour, and really easy, tho' I made it even easier because I didn't I didn't read the directions first.  I put everything in my KA mixer bowl and started beating at a low speed, gradually increasing the speed as everything was incorporated.  I could eat this stuff by the spoonful.  Tried a batch with 1/4 c. French Vanilla Coffee flavouring (made from scratch) and it's added a lovely subtle flavour to the icing.

I had no icing for a cake that I was making. I came on here and found this recipe. I just made it and I took one small scoop with my finger and it tastes like something you could buy at the store, but much, much better. I honestly don't think I will buy icing anymore, I will just use this recipe because it is that good.

I tried several buttercream recipes before I made my daughter's cake, and this one was heads and tails above the rest!!  I'm not normally a baker, but found this frosting to be light and fluffy and creamy (and the only change I made was to use cream instead of milk).   The key for me was to let the mixer go for several minutes until it became light and fluffy.  This will be my go-to frosting recipe moving forward.

Delicious! Triple the recipe (for a triple layer cake) using 1 stick salted butter and 2 unsalted, don't add table salt as it can make a grainy texture. If a lighter flavor is desired only use unsalted butter. Use whole milk, possibly cut out 1/4 of the milk depending on humidity and add a small amount of meringue powder (about 1/2 tsp/recipe)  for a stiffer decorating consistency. I may occasionally add an additional 1/4 or so of powdered sugar, but i try to avoid making it overly sweet!

This recipe was just what I was looking for. This buttercream is  SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!! I cut down a little on the sugar and only used 1 3/4 cups and used half and half instead of milk (because that's all i had in the frig). I did't use all the milk because i wanted a little stiffer frosting. Also used a little extra vanilla. This will be my go to buttercream frosting.

This is the best buttercream I've ever made!  The only change I made was used 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract and a pinch of salt.  I like the almond flavoring and wanted it for a white cake and a raspberry filling but I'm sure it would be awesome with just vanilla, also.

This buttercream had a nice consistency and looked good, but it tasted like pure sugar, just overwhelmingly sweet. I'm talking tooth-achingly sweet, like a punch of sugar to your mouth. I couldn't even taste the butter (I'd used a good Irish butter) or vanilla. It essentially ruined the layer cake I made. Most of my family members, including all the kids(!) scraped off the frosting. The only person who didn't scrape it off ate his with chocolate ice cream and said the ice cream made it palatable. It's a shame because this recipe is easy to whip up and really does look nice on cakes. Just can't get over the flavor.

A wonderful recipe that doesn't require cooking anything.  Perfect just the way it is.  I've also changed the vanilla out for other extracts.  And I've tried the chocolate variation posted in the comments by another user.  This doesn't make a lot of icing so be prepared to make more than one batch.  For an even different variation I combined this with cream cheese icing for rave reviews at work.  2 parts butter cream to 1 part cream cheese icing.

Best Buttercream Icing recipe!  I used my kitchen aide mixer with the whip attachment and it was perfect!  U probably have to double recipe to frost a 2 layer cake,  but this is not a problem.  Definitely a keeper!!

I've made this twice now, once for 10 cupcakes and once for a 2 layer 8" cake. There was just enough frosting both times, however if you like a lot of frosting, or wish to do extra decorating, you may want to bump the recipe up a little. It's creamy, buttery, delicious and very easy to work with. It's a great base recipe with room to play around with (i.e. sub a little cream cheeses, add lemon juice, etc..).

Like others, I have never managed to find a frosting recipe that I truly love.  This recipe is AMAZING!  I made not alterations and it was perfect.  Not too sweet and oh so creamy.  I used gel food coloring and it didn't change the consistency.  Keeper for sure!

so many times when making a buttercream, it can be greasy. this is not it turns out nice every time i make. works beautiful on a cake or cupcake. to fill and frost a 9 inch round you will need to double.

I am going to use this recipe again and again!

I had to make some adjustments this time, based on what I had on hand, because I didn't have enough butter to make this times 6. I needed a lot of frosting to put on an 11x17 cake for my daughter's birthday party. 

I also did not have any clear vanilla, but I had two Lor Ann Buttercream flavored drams. So I used those with the rest of the 12tsps being vanilla extract. I am guessing this changed the flavor quite a bit. 

Finally, I did add cream of tartar to the powdered sugar (like 3 tsps), largely because I had used it in buttercreams I had made before.  I didn't sift the sugar, but rather wisked it all together. I followed the advice here to add it a cup at a time to the butter and Butter Crisco (even mix of those).

So, next time I make this, I will try to  follow the recipe more exactly. But, I have no idea how you could possibly whip the butter fast enough by hand. Still, this recipe is a keeper! (I had no idea how much food coloring to add, and that was helpful to note.)

Followed this recipe to a T, did not work at all. Consistency all wrong, tasted gross. Hate writing negative reviews, and really needed this recipe to turn out, but it didn't :( Keep thinking I did something wrong, but until it turned out bad and I had to make alterations, I did exactly what instructed to do. Bummer :(

Wow! This is by far the best butter icing I've ever made and beats the bought ones hands down. I made it as written with the exception of using 1/2 lemon extract and 1/2 vanilla. The consistency was creamy and fluffy and perfect for piping onto my cupcakes. This is my new favourite icing. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy basic buttercream icing.  Easy to pipe and nice gloss.  I doubled the vanilla as it was too plain. Would be a great base for chocolate or flavoured icing too. I used it fresh from making so not sure I YOU can make ahead or not. Yummy.

Great basic icing recipe... have made it dozens of times by now.  A single recipe doesn't make a whole lot.. for example, I have to make about 1 1/2 of the recipe to pipe 12 cupcakes in a basic swirl pattern.

You can omit the milk if your cake/cupcakes are not going to be refrigerated, which I often do when taking things to work because frig space is limited.  Your icing won't be QUITE as smooth, but it's still good.

If you are piping something that really requires your frosting to hold a design, then up the sugar and/or omit the milk.  Your frosting will be sweeter, but you want a stiffer icing.  

I haven't tried making it chocolate yet, but have read reviews about adding 2/3 cup of cocoa and will be trying that next.

Good luck!

I made this frosting for the white cake.  It was easy, it was good and fluffy.  I had JUST enough for the cake which I baked in 2 9" rounds.  I put preserves between the layers, if I hadn't done that, I'm not sure there would be enough to frost the entire cake with in between the layers.  It was good though, thank you for sharing!  I'll be making this again

The best buttercream recipe I've tried so far. I was able to ice about 20 mini-cupcakes with one batch. It was creamy and easy to work with. The only change I made was using about 1/2 a cup less icing sugar to keep it from tasting too sugary, but that's more a personal preference than an issue with the recipe.

Just made this for a 9x13 birthday cake. So far I licked the spoon and it tastes awfully yummy. Can't wait to taste it with the cake later. I followed the recipe and it made just enough for the entire cake. That was just spread on though.  No fancy edge piping or anything. If you are looking to do that then I would double the recipe.

I was looking for an easy frosting without too much butter or shortning, and one that didn't have to be cooked. I doubled the recipe to frost 2 nine inch layers. I put the frosting on the chocolate cake on the hershey's cocoa can. Perfect combination, I now a new favorite cake.

Wonderful and I'm not even a big fan of buttercream. No weird aftertaste and residue on my tongue which I typically encounter with store bought buttercream! I think the big diff is the stores must use some shortening instead of all butter. anyway this was easy and yummy. Definitely follow recipe to the letter for great results (esp beating for the specified # of minutes). everybody raved over my cake!

Loved this buttercream frosting.  It will be my go-to recipe for buttercream now!  I doubled the recipe & had plenty for a 2 layer round cake.

After failing to find a good recipe for buttercream frosting I came across this one and will definitely use it again and again. It requires the minimum of products and makes a gorgeous frosting to pipe onto cakes. My 3 year old loved it! We added just a touch of pink food coloring to it. I would definitely recommend this recipe! Thank you!!!

Don't be shy with the butter. It helps make it creamier obviously. Also if you're using cocoa for chocolate icing don't worry about the vanilla.

This frosting is divine! Silky and rich, texture practically like the butter it's made of. I've made this once according to recipe strictly, and the second time I made it there were a few SMALL adjustments! (For a milk-chocolate buttercream that'll blow your mind.)

1. Take a tablespoon or two of the powdered sugar out of the recipe to make way for the cocoa powder, so as not to make the frosting too dry or powdery.

2. Use 1 teaspoon vanilla instead of 1 1/2 per recipe. This is for the regular AND chocolate, as I found this icing to have an overly-intense vanilla flavor that left an aftertaste. (I used real vanilla.)

3. For the chocolate (MILD, milky chocolate flavor and color! This isn't a dark chocolate substitution.), after removing 2 tablespoons or so of the powdered sugar from the recipe and blending all ingredients according to recipe smoothly, mix in 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder or to taste.

TIP: For the chocolate variation, I use salted butter. It works, because salt and chocolate go together so well! I feel this really makes the recipe. Best chocolate frosting of any kind I've EVER had! Docked a star for the intense vanilla, but that can easily be cut in half!

I made this exactly as written and it turned out fantastic!  I made cupcakes for my son's 5th birthday party (crazy cake recipe from here) and frosted some with this and others with "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" also from allrecipies.  Both were delicious, but this buttercream was my favorite.  4 of the moms asked me to send them the recipes.  I am so glad that I didn't use pre-made frosting.  It was so easy to make and so much better than store bought.  This is my new go-to forever!  Thank you!

I'll have to work with the cocoa recipe, but the vanilla was super! I trippled the recipe  and it made more than enough for 54 - 58 cupcakes. I followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the vanilla by 1/3 and adding 1/3 of almond extract. I had many comments on how great the cupcakes were . Many complemented on how fluffy  and delicious the frosting was! This recipe is a keeper.

I used this recipe as a starting point and altered to my liking. I added 1/2 package of cream cheese,  1 tsp almond flavor,  and about 1/2 -  1 cup more powdered sugar to get to the right consistency.  It frosted 24 cupcakes. There was only one left by the end of Christmas day!

Excellent recipe!  Perfect proportions - the recipe as is isn't enough frosting if you're like me and need to test things out ahead of time.  I doubled it and ended up quadrupling it for 18 cupcakes (I messed up a little).  Overall, great recipe.

I made this frosting exactly as the recipe instructed. I also made another batch for chocolate frosting--add 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and beat with a mixer. For both I  used my Kitchenaid stand mixer with the paddle attatchment. For the chocolate I beat it an extra 3 minutes. They both tasted great. 
I used the chocolate with the Hedgehog cookies from mamakittyto3.

I was in the middle of making some cupcakes when the recipe called for a lemon whipped topping. I tried whipping it over and over and I suppose I'm still too novice to master whipping cream without creating butter and disappointment. I ended up fretting that I wouldn't have anything to top the cupcakes so I found this quick and easy recipe. It has ingredients that almost every baker (or really anyone with a nicely stocked kitchen) can pull and it was so easy, simple and fast to make. It was a bit melty at first although when put in the fridge it hardened to a nice marbled look. 

I also used salted Kerrygold butter instead of unsalted but it still tasted delicious.

I followed other reviewers advice and used salted butter, whipping cream rather than milk (as I had that on hand), and also doubled the amount of vanilla (I used two tablespoons of vanilla in a doubled recipe) and halved the amount of cream to make up for the extra vanilla.. For 23 cupcakes I used every single bit of that double batch of icing, (next time I will use the full amount of cream and a little extra powdered sugar for the additional bit of icing) but it piped absolutely beautifully and tasted amazing.. This recipe is a keeper, probably the best vanilla buttercream I've ever had and I'm giving it 5 stars with the changes I made.

Since I'm virtually poor and have to use whatever I have on hand to make things I had to use the store brand country crock to make this.  It's a little runny but real butter is thicker so this was expected.     I wanted this for a microwave mug cake that I made.   It definitely served its purpose and was delicious.  Hey, beggars can't be choosers! ;-)

This is my go to for icing as far as I'm concerned.  This held up very well the only thing is it has to be kept in a cool place once you used it. I doubled this recipe because I had to Frost lots of cupcakes. I also added more confectioners sugar to get it to the consistency I needed because I was working with food coloring too.

Frosting was very good but it doesn't make that much.  I doubled recipe as I wanted to frost 9 x 13 inch pan cake.  I did have leftover frosting (never a bad thing)  but would not have enough if I did not multiply recipe.   While not overly sweet I think next time I would cut back on sugar more

Best frosting I've made to date!! Fluffy tasty and great to decorate with. I have tried so many recipes over the years and was never really thrilled with my results. I  just made this tonight to decorate my daughters cake and I'm extremely pleased. My husband, who is my official taste tester agreed this was my best frosting. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 cake and made the recipe exactly as written. I used Wilton cake coloring gel to add color to the frosting.  A keeper. Thank you!!

very good recipe but doesn't make a large batch so you might want to double if using on layers.

Easy to make. Just right- sweet , can taste the vanilla, and not too buttery.  Our whole family liked it.

I made this buttercream frosting for my granddaughter's cake on her 6th birthday.  I doubled the recipe because I had 3 layers to frost and this was the perfect amount!  Between frosting each layer I mixed the frosting on high for 15 seconds or so.  Turned out well!

Simple and easy; the richer the butter, the better result. I added a tablespoon of bourbon and liked it.  It was a tad too sweet; will reduce the sugar and possibly try vanilla bean next time.

Way too sweet and too much vanilla extract for such a small amount of icing. If you double the butter, I think it would be much better, but as is, not so great. :/

This frosting is perfect for piping onto cupcakes and cakes. As for flavor, it's sweet and buttery just like American buttercream should be! If you are looking for a smooth, creamy, and delicious buttercream, this is for you! *substitutions and tips:* 1. I didn't need any of the milk because my butter was pretty soft when I started. 2. I like to add fresh berries to the frosting while it's mixing. (Unless the berries are really soft like raspberries and blueberries, you might want to chop them up or pulse in a food processor.) 3. You can make this chocolate frosting by adding cocoa powder and some extra powdered sugar (to cut down the bitterness.) 4. To make AHHMAZING mocha frosting, throw in a spoonful of cocoa, a little more powdered sugar, and a few tablespoons of cold brew coffee (cold brew coffee is important because it is concentrated. Sometimes cold brew is called coffee concentrate.) Thanks for the great recipe!

This was perfect! I followed the advice of others and used salted butter  which was amazing. I hate icings that are too sweet so I left out the vanilla and added a small amount of salt in addition to the salted butter. It turned out amazing and everyone loved it. Worked perfectly for cupcakes.

Quick, easy and awesome! Would have been way more fluffy but discovered my stand mixer's motor apparently died on me and I had to mix this by hand.  But it still mixed really smooth. 

I doubled the recipe and I think I'll have more  than I will need but thank goodness frosting freezes.  

I added about 1 TSP cinnamon {I didn't measure}  right at the end and that was exactly enough to give the vanilla a tiny kiss of cinnamon flavour.  

Will DEFINITELY be making this again.

I made this per the recipe but substituted some Crown maple whiskey for the Vanilla extract. I did not add any milk. It came out great! The consistency and texture were perfect for piping.  I used it to frost some chocolate espresso cupcakes.

This is hands down the best vanilla buttercream frosting I've ever made! The consistency is fluffy and perfect for piping. The taste is incredible! I doubled the recipe and it frosted 34 rosette cupcakes. I think next time I'll try with almond or orange extract.

I am not a big frosting lover and I especially do not like frosting that has shortening in it. I needed to find a frosting that would hold up well on 48 cupcakes for my grandsons birthday. This was it!!  This is a very tasty frosting that is not too sweet. I quadrupled the recipe and had enough left over for about 4-5 more cupcakes. I decorated with swirls which takes more frosting. Nothing worse than running out of colored frosting. I used paste coloring. This will be my go to frosting.

This is a fantastic recipe for a simple buttercream. I have used it making macaron fillings and also to ice a cake. Being a very simple recipe, it is easy to tweak certain things in it. For example, for almond buttercream you can use almond extract instead of vanilla, or even add 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to make it chocolate. The only recommendation I have for making this icing is to take your time because if you do not beat the ingredients long enough, the consistency is off.

My first time ever making icing and I Loved  the simplicity and ease of how it was to pipe . But like a review said earlier that it makes a small batch so you may need to double if you need more, which I ended up doing.

I've never made buttercream frosting until now. This recipe was quick and easy and is the perfect consistency and flavor! I do agree with other comments though that this makes a vedry small batch so you might want to double the recipe if you're making more than a dozen cupcakes :)

This is delicious,  creamy and fluffy. I made it pretty much as written. Only change, but really was a delay not a change.  I made the icing late at night and didn't feel like icing cupcakes, so I made it all the way except milk.  Since, I new it would be hard in morning from the fridge. I added icing back to mixer and added milk one tablespoon at a time as I added coloring.  The icing turned out better than my cupcakes did! Totally saved them. It make enough icing to ice 24 cupcakes with abundant amounts!!!!!

It was okay. There was separation from some of the items so it didn't look very appealing. Tasted okay, quite sugary. Most likely won't be making this again, but was fun to give it a try.

Enough to frost the top of a 10 x 13; I personally like a Lot of frosting so to double to actually decorate would be perfect.
it started to loosen while decorating so more sugar was needed

1st time: Yum! Turned out SOOO creamy! But if you're going to double it, don't double your extract! (I used almond and there was way too much.) Just add a bit at a time, to taste.

2nd time: Also, don't add pineapple chunks...I guess citrus + dairy = sad frosting.

This recipe was much too salty and I will not make it again this way. After we made the regular buttercream frosting we tried to make it less salty but that did not work. I will not use this recipe again.

If I did make this recipe again i would put less butter. I changed the recipe from 1/2 cup of butter to 6 tablespoons. My family did think it was too sugary and they got headaches.

This is great for a simple buttercream, works well for piping however not in warmer conditions. As others have said though, you defiantly want to double or triple the batch as it is tiny :)

This frosting saved me! No really, someone had eating the entire batch of frosting I was going to use and this frosting was quick and worked. Maybe even better than the original, much more time-consuming recipe. Very fluffy and great for piping.

I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out perfectly as pictured. It held is shape super well and stiffens within minutes, so I loved using it for decorating. Unfortunately, it was far too sweet-- and that is a lot coming from me. I would use it again, but not on a cake that is already pretty sweet. Thanks for sharing!

I just did this recipe but made one curious change... Upon adding milk, I saw my mom had some coffee creamer stashed in the back of the fridge. I used 2tbsp of white chocolate mocha coffee creamer (from international delight) it added such a good flavor to it and I will no doubt experiment with other creamer flavors now too in the future. Seriously, give it a try. So tasty.

Excellent. I have made this several times but found that it turned out best when my butter was extra soft, to the point of almost melting, and whipped it like nobody's business. I also used slightly less powdered sugar and it was plenty sweet. It turns out light and fluffy when you whip it good! Idoubled this recipe for 24 cupcakes & had a little left over.

I didn't change anything with regard to recipe ingredients however  I did take other's advice in doubling up recipe.  The taste of icing is as described...consistency and ease of spreading on cake with enough hold worked out great as well.   This Recipe is a keeper!

I used this recipe for my sons graduation cakes and received a lot of compliments on how creamy and smooth it was. I made sure to blend on lowest setting on my stand mixer and blended it a few minutes. It was amazing! Thank you for putting this recipe on here. Will definitely use again. I did double the recipe and was able to frost 3 cakes(2-11x17s & 1-9x13)

This was fantastic. I'd tried a couple of other buttercream recipes in the past, and this was by far the best. I doubled the recipe to frost 24 cupcakes. Also used half-and-half instead of the milk, and added it gradually  so it wasn't too soft.

This Icing was wonderful!! It was so creamy and the  icing held up so well! I like the fact that if it comes out too thin or you want it to be a little stiffer you just add more powdered sugar. I put half almond extract and half vanilla so it would complement the cake I made!! Love it!!

Good basic starter recipe,however need to double it if you are making even a regular 9×13 cake.Also would be nice if there were a way to make it a little less sweet.

Me and my sister made this for the first time, it tasted amazing but it came out to runny, it may have came out like that because of a mistake on our part but i feel like you may need to use more powdered sugar or less milk. Other wise i would definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing! It is by far my favorite buttercream icing recipe. And it is the one icing that I could eat by itself and never get tired of it. I made sure to cream it for a while to get it nice and fluffy. But keep in mind that if you like piping the icing onto your cupcakes in nice tall swirls one serving is good for one cupcake. Love It!

It was delicious.  A little thinner than I thought it would be, but good. I added a few dashes of ground sea salt, and it reduced the sweetness, and enhanced the creamy rich flavor of the icing.

This really is the perfect buttercream. It instantly melts in your mouth! Instead of two tablespoons of milk, I added just one, I felt like that was enough. Adding two tablespoons made it too runny.

Instead of milk I used almond milk and added 1/3 cup of cacao powder -- end results were amazing. Almost fudge-like flavor and silky smooth consistency (not as fluffy) and great for icing a cake and cupcakes.

No changes, made 2 double batches to ice 12 cupcakes and a 2 layer cake. (One 8 inch round, halved and filled, and one 4 inch)
The 2nd batch I used 1 cup less powdered sugar , just because I liked the buttery taste to go on a caramel/red velvet swirl movie theme cake that had caramel corn on top. I ended up whipping the 2 batches together in the end. There is a pic I submitted before adding the birthday girl's name.

This was amazing!  Used it for a carrot cake because someone requested NO cream cheese.  I added just a splash of almond extract, and this frosting was perfect with carrot cake!  Can't wait to try it for other cakes.  

It did get a little soft, but a little time in the fridge firmed it right up and still tasted fresh

This was super easy & super creamy but it's incredibly sweet, so I didn't pile this on cupcakes like I do with some frostings.  I was able to frost 12 cupcakes with this recipe.  Thank you for sharing :)

Perfect. I used half and half instead of milk, as I had it in the fridge, and a scant pound of powdered sugar, as I was too lazy to measure. This frosted maybe a dozen cupcakes. This will be my go-to buttercream recipe. Delicious and easy.

It was absolutely delicious, but it definitely wasn't enough for ten cupcakes, I had to make it twice. Also, I would recommend using just two cups of icing sugar, it's more than enough.

The frosting was delicious but what I suggest is that you lower the milk down to 1 tbsp because that's what I added and it came out nice and creamy! Also, if you think there's too much sugar, or its too sweet, just substitute some sugar for cocoa powder to get chocolate buttercream.

I decided to try this in lieu of a family recipe. Since I had a beloved recipe to compare it to, I wanted to offer my observations! First off, the use of unsalted butter seemed to dull the taste of the recipe somewhat. I decided to try making it both ways, and if you have ever baked brownies with and without salt, you will identify the difference I am describing. That being said, the lack of salt doesn't seem to affect the outcome of this recipe. Try it both ways to see what you like best. The only change I made was when adding the milk.  I added a full tablespoon right off, but waited to see what the consistency would be.  I'm glad I did as I never had to add the second tablespoon. I was able to frost 16 cupcakes with the recipe's yield.

I originally followed the recipe, tasted it, and just was not flavorful enough. Added just a few extra drops of extract and tasted better. Will try again but adding more touches. Was a little fluffy but not like they make at a cupcake shop. This was my first time ever making a frosting though. This was just enough to do a bakers dozen regular sized cupcakes. The biggest problem I had was using a hand mixer and adding the sugar. Lots of mess. Kitchen looked like a bakery. LOL. Wife said it tasted very sweet at first, but that it mellowef out quickly on the second bite. All in all, great recipe for someone that is making it for the first time and wants to get a handle on how to start out.

It was OK. I doubled the recipe but it was still lacking. So I added an 8 oz. brick of cream cheese (softened) and it turned my frown upside down!!

This icing is great!  Next time I need to not use as much sugar.  I doubled the recipe to frost the cake but should not have doubled the confectioners sugar so much.  Also, next time, when making a lemon cake, I'll try lemon extract or pure lemon in the icing.  However, the husband says it is a "keeper" recipe.

I had to add a lot more powdered sugar to this recipe in order to make it thick enough to hold when piping it out of a pastry bag (to stay on top of a cupcake) otherwise it would have dripped right off...and I had followed the recipe exact.  Added a lot more powdered sugar - needed almost double.

This was perfect! I made a double batch for some sugar cookies and it was easily the best buttercream frosting I've made. 

Full disclosure though, I did add some heavy cream and honey to my frosting.

I don't have a mixer but this recipe is really easy to do by hand. It doesn't make very much and  it's very sweet. I'm using this for my daughters first birthday cake so I didn't like how sweet it turned out.so I took a container of cool whip and added it to the recipe at the end.  It's perfect now! Light and fluffy..not too sweet...perfect amount and holds up well with decorating a cake.

Made this recipe as is. It was perfect. Even my husband liked it and he is hard to please when it comes to frosting. ?? Nice and fluffy. I will use this again.

I only had salted butter, but this still turned out wonderfully. My husband said, "Can we just have some of this frosting on hand all the time?" :) The perfect combo of fluffy yet firm. Thank you!

Pretty good! It's basically the recipe on the back of the powdered sugar bag I used, lol. I had to double it to ice an 8" round double layer cake comfortably. I also did 1/2 tbsp vanilla and 1/2 tbsp almond extract. It turned out perfect. Very easy and doesn't take long. It could be a bit "stiffer" imo. But it tastes awesome.

My son's favorite cake is peppermint, which is unusual, but very yummy. I double this recipe, and it really is creamy, fluffy, and delicious.  I use unsalted butter, but add a small pinch of salt.  Also, even though I doubled everything else, I only used 3 T. of milk. Doubling this recipe is the perfect amount to ice a 9" cake generously.  Thanks for a great one!

I made this and it is super light, fluffy and delicious! Perfect for icing and decorating! But make sure to beat the butter enough, otherwise your icing will be chunky, have butter specks in it and it will not hold the shape you pipe it into.

Exactly what I wanted, just like Mamma used to make--very creamy, but has body. I use buttermilk, because it's what I have, so add a bit extra milk if using that.  Also, anytime you make something sweet, add a pinch of salt to  bring out the sweet, but take off the edge.   Thanks for such a great recipe.

Wow.. this was perfect buttercream frosting.  I added a little bit of butter flavoring to give it the perfect buttery/vanilla taste.  It was easy, had lovely texture, and tasted fantastic.

I make buttercream frosting quite often, but I have to say that the consistency of this frosting is very nice and it has a great flavor, too.  The key is to whip the butter and to continue beating the frosting after the milk has been added.

Perfect for my chocolate cake I just made.! My kids helped and it came out perfect. I doubled the recipe to frost a 2 layer 8-9" cake. Had enough to pipe around the base and do a swirl design on top.

I love this recipe, but you need to double and sometimes triple it to get the amount you need. Other than that it is the best frosting recipe I have ever found. And I have found a LOT.

This is absolutely the best recipe for buttercream that I have ever used.  It was fluffy and smooth and so delicious!!  I used it for cupcakes for a Valentines day dinner at my church and they looked beautiful.  I piped the icing onto the cupcakes and it was a perfect consistency for piping.  I will always use this recipe from now on.

This frosting is just great as is - what's so perect is that it can be adusted to add any flavor you want.  I added more vanilla and a couple of tablespoons of mascarpone. Really delicious. Will definitely make again.

The flavor was awesome. In the 1970's I made my sister's wedding cake and used a buttercream icing on it. Over the years the recipe I had was lost and I have been trying other recipes recently, never finding one that quite made it. I am so disappointed in the texture and taste of canned buttercream. This was awesome! I made two recipes to frost a double layer cake, there was a little left over but I was happy that there was enough to put a thicker than usual layer between the cakes. I won't be looking for the perfect buttercream any more.

Unbelievably good. Perfect. I will never buy store bought frosting again. I ran out of the Betty Crocker frosting mid way through icing my cake, so I hopped on my app and pulled this up. I made it in a jiffy and it was so good I slathered my whole cake with it, covering the nasty Betty Crocker stuff! I followed the recipe exactly. Perfect taste, texture and color. Thank you for this recipe!!!

OMG!  This icing is super!  I didn't change a thing and it was sweet  but not  sickeningly sweet.  I took another trusted user's advice in it not being sufficient to ice more than 10 cupcakes and tripled the recipe for  60 cupcakes ...however, I ended up with enough left over to ice a round layer cake !   
The only thing I did for variety was add 1/2 Cup of Dutch cocoa to half of it.  Delightful!  I have saved this recipe for future use.

I made a few modifications and really liked the end result. Changes: increased the butter to 1 cup, increased the confectioner's sugar to 2 1/2 cups and decreased the vanilla extract to 1 tsp.  This was enough to cover 18 regular cup cakes and 22 mini cupcakes using a butterknife with plenty leftover. I wanted half my cupcakes with vanilla frosting and half with chocolate icing - once I iced the first half I then add 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder to the remaining icing and used a mixer to blend for a few more minutes to incorporate the cocoa. I loved the light flavor of the chocolate.  I will make it again!

Just made this tonight as a quick icing for some cupcakes.  I followed the directions precisely (except I used SALTED butter) and got excellent results.  I also divided the batch in two and added 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder to half of it, again with really great results.  Both tasted great and spread beautifully.  I'm a little surprised at the many reviews that say it doesn't ice very many cupcakes.  I was able to cover 22 of them nicely with the full batch, though I didn't spread it extremely thick.  I would say it's definitely good for anywhere from 15 to 20 cupcakes, unless you're really piling it on there - lol.  This recipe is easy to make and seems quite versatile.  I will definitely make it again!!  Thanks for sharing it!!

This recipe tastes like it came from a professional cake decorator.  I left out the vanilla  since I don't prefer the strong  flavor, and  thought it was absolutely perfect.  Doubling the recipe made enough for 2 dozen cupcakes, which were a huge hit at a church potluck.

Perfect buttercream!  Amazing as is, I wouldn't change a thing.  I was so happy to find a buttercream that called for real butter and not shortening.  Thank you!  REVIEW UPDATE 6.13.17 - I double this recipe to frost 24 cupcakes with a large star tip (with a little extra left over).  To make this chocolate buttercream, add in 1/4 to 1/2 cup of cocoa powder to a double recipe.  To make a mint buttercream, substitute mint extract for the vanilla extract (I use about 2 teaspoons for the double recipe).  Such a versatile recipe I use for all of my cupcakes and have received many requests for it, as it is not an overly sweet buttercream, but perfectly complements the cupcakes.

For the comment mentioning it's too sweet, well it IS made of just butter and SUGAR so, keep that in mind ;)
This is a great quick and easy butter cream frosting that's super easy to fix - too moist? add more icing sugar .. too sticky for your liking? add a smidgen more milk. Take the measurements with a grain of salt, as this is one of those 'how you like it' recipes. It's so yummy. I'm never buying another can of that pre made stuff again.

Definitely double the recipe to cover 12 cupcakes. You will have extra but one batch is likely not enough. Great recipe though.

I have now made this buttercream twice. The first time it was good by itself but when paired with a cake it was entirely too sweet.  The second time I made it, based on other suggestions, I used salted butter instead and it turned out AMAZING.

Pretty good for my first attempt.  It wasn't as pretty or as smooth and fluffy-looking as the photo, but it tasted great.  I doubled this recipe for a 2-layer 9" round cake.

This was quite sweet but smooth.  Was told "tastes like powdered sugar"-that's not the type of reaction I like to hear when I bake for friends.  It was ok but prob won't make again.

My daughter and I found this recipe as I didn't want to go out and purchase the store bought kind. Luckily we had the ingredients on hand. We followed the recipe exactly,  but decided to add a touch of peppermint extract to give it a little zing! You'll have to double the recipe to frost a batch of cupcakes or a double layer round cake.

This tastes so good! I made triple the batch to frost cookies since one batch of this doesn't go far. I have to say though, it calls for a LOT more confectioner's sugar than needed. I had to scale back and add milk because it was just too stiff and crumbly. Also add more vanilla.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe, but used 3 cups of sugar instead of 4, and also substituted the milk for heavy whipping cream. It turned out perfectly, and was very easy to make. I will be making this again!

The first time I made this, I used  salted butter (because I had it on hand) and did not care for it at all! Tasted like I was eating a stick of sweetened butter. I decided to try it again, this time with unsalted, and it was MUCH better.  It was good! Nice addition to the cake. I made a quarter sheet and doubled the recipe. I could have tripled it to make it cover better but it wasn't important. Although I don't "love it' for a five star, I do "like it" and would make it again.

Awesome flavour, good amount of vanilla, I used HALF the sugar and found it very sweet (but a good amount of sweet). If I would add the recipe amount I would say that is WAY too sweet like many frosting recipes. So, half the sugar and it's perfect. :)

Light and easy for decorating any cake, this recipe is truly one of my favourite frostings. It was however a little bit too sweet and it was pretty hard to enjoy completly the cupcakes I made. At first, I used 2 tablespoons of icing for each cupcake, and very quickly, I noticed it was not enough for 12 cupcakes. But the rest of the recipe is far good enough.

Didn't make any changes This is in no way enough to frost a typical 8 or 9 inch layer cake or 2 dozen cupcakes.  Tasted fine but honestly not that different than other buttercreams I've tried.

LOVED this recipe! Better than any other frosting I've ever used. Perfect consistency for frosting cupcakes. I tripled the recipe and worked out perfect for 4 dozen cupcakes... had a small bit of frosting left over. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

Loved this recipe, i t was beautifully fluffy, almost whipped! The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar. I took it down from 1 cup to 2 cups. 2 cups just seem like a lot!

I found that the frosting was to sweet for my taste. Does anyone know how to make it less sweet? Do i add more butter?

My only changes were I used salted butter because its what I had and I was a little under 2 cups of powdered sugar.  Didn't prepare properly. I have to say this is the creamiest butter cream icing I've ever made. Mine usually has a slightly gritty feel from the sugar and couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. This is my new favorite recipe

Best buttercream frosting I've ever made! I used regular salted butter & it tasted amazing. I doubled the recipe so I'd have enough to frost and fill a 2-layer round cake.  I creamed the butter very thoroughly first, added the icing sugar gradually with plenty of mixing and at the end, the fluffy, light, smooth texture was really great. 
It looked like it might not be enough so I added a little more than 1 cup of extra icing sugar to stretch it out. I ended up with yummy frosting leftovers after frosting the layer cake. I'll do the same next time!

Only used about half the milk and then added food coloring for a nice stuff consistency for decorating. I've used this for several large events and everyone loves it and thinks it comes from a cake shop.

I've made plenty of buttercream recipes over the years but couldn't find the right fluffy consistency and not too super sweet taste. I also hate shortening, so I figured I'd give this one a try. Fabulous frosting.   I used 1 tsp cream cheese emulsion and 1/2 tsp vanilla for mini brownie bites. I loved the taste and the fluffy, not over powering taste unlike traditional cream cheese frosting. This is a keeper.

Perfect!!! It set up perfectly and remained stiff enough for pipping decorations. I doubled the recipe  to do a cake and left off 1 cup of confectioners sugar to cut down on sweetness. Still tasted great. Thanks!!!!

With just a few tweaks, I will use this frosting on all my cakes and cupcakes from now on. I cut the sugar back to a cup and a half and used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. It was a hit!  You'll need to double the recipe... at the very least if you like a good amount of frosting.

Made this recipe last night for a sponge cake that was cooking, despite having to franticly make two more serving ending in 3 total, the frosting tasted great and frosted well. I was frosting two mini cakes and the amount of frosting the first batch made was hardly enough to frost a single layer of the cakes. I would say this recipe makes about 1 cup, not near 2. However I didn't measure so I can't be sure. Other than that the recipe tastes amazing.

Great! And everyone else is using the other buttercream recipe, complaining about the shortening... They should've used this recipe first! I added a handful of chopped cherries and extra powdered sugar to compensate for the moisture from the cherries.

I made this icing for a giant Mother's Day sugar cookie for my mum and she loved it. I used SALTED butter, let it sit at room temperature until just soft enough to work with but not too mushy, followed the directions exactly, and it was PERFECT! Light, fluffy, not at all grainy or too sweet. Just. Right.

Great recipe, thanks! Took me all these years to find this kind of frosting. I always thought cream cheese frosting was the way to go and also always failed at it -- like soup, melting, too sweet, various methods to try and fix it. Sigh.  Anyway, for this recipe, I only used a teaspoon of extract. To compensate, I added a tad bit of vanilla sugar. Also, didn't have a sifter so ran powdered sugar through small metal strainer with spoon. Oops yeah, I also doubled the butter to 1 cup. Turned out perfectly! My daughter and her school friends scarfed them down. I am STILL trying to resist the very few leftovers. :) Generously covered 24 cupcakes by doubling butter and it was gorgeous, very professional frosting like. 
p.s Only put 4 stars because I had to change it to really love it. Good basics though -- thanks!

Very good icing and perfect to pipe on cupcakes. The consistency was just right to pipe easily but hold its shape once on the cupcake.

As others have said, a single recipe is barely enough for 9-10 cupcakes so adjust accordingly.

It looks good...but it tastes horrendous. I tried making it exactly as the recipe called for and it just tasted like biting into a stick of butter with a weird powdered sugar aftertaste. I used organic butter & Domino's cane sugar confectioner's sugar. Yuck! Then I tried making a 2nd batch with tips from reviews-- making sure to really cream the butter and sugar, and then beating it for longer. I tried extra vanilla. I tried it with condensed milk. I tried toying with the ratios. I tried adding salt to cut the sweetness. I tried adding hot condensed milk to cook the sNo experienced baker would use this.

This is my first attempt to decorate a cake.  Typically, I use cream cheese icing and never decorate the cake.  My grandson's first birthday is coming up so here I go.  Found this recipe and my daughter liked the taste.  We tried our first two small cakes and it was not a disaster and the icing actually tasted good, which was a surprise to us!  We plan to go pick up food coloring and make his cake this week.  It's a smash cake so we don't expect it to be perfect. Thank you so very much for this recipe.  Because of this recipe, I may continue to attempt to decorate cakes. Like other reviewers, you will need to add extra conf. sugar to make sure it's thick enough.

I mixed in brown food coloring and it separated and looked terrible. So I tried a bunch of fixes I found online and none of them worked, just made everything worse.

Next time: after beating butter add in liquid ingredients first, if that doesn't work then I'm not trying this one again.

When I made this buttercream I doubled the recipe and it came out a little grainy, but added more powdered sugar and beat it a bit more and it was delicious! Everyone loved it and I could pipe it easily. I will definitely use this again!

I've made many great buttercream recipes and thought Wow! this one looks quick and easy.   It was so well reviewed, I decided to try it.  When I followed the recipe exactly, it was too runny and way too sweet (and I like sweet!)--without any depth of flavor you expect in a buttercream.  I added more confectionary sugar to make it less runny but that made it even sweeter, of course.  I tried some extra vanilla but in the end, it could not be saved.  My children really liked it but they also think straight sugar is delicious, so they aren't the best judges of flavor.  :)

This was my first attempt at homemade icing and it was perfect! I followed the recipe without changes and it was very easy to use for frosting and decorating-- and it was also delicious!

Loved the thickness of this recipe! Really sweet, perfect for a cake. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon for extra taste. Followed the recipe carefully with a little extra vanilla. If you were to compare this butter cream with the store junk....this would win by FAR! Loved it!!

The icing came out very watery so I had to add more confectioners sugar to thicken it up so the taste was overwhelmingly sweet for me and it wasn't this nice white as the pictures show I guess I'd have to use like a clear color vanilla extract. So I only ended up using it as a crumb coat cover and made a different frosting.

Very fluffy and quite delicious!  Must say this is probably the best buttercream frosting I've ever made.  I did use salted butter because that is what I had on hand, but I would have added a bit of salt anyway because I always use a pinch just to tone down the sweetness.  Many thanks for this outstanding recipe!

I was able to frost both mini and regular sized cupcakes with that one mixer without doubling it. (just I did add a little bit of store bought frosting that I had on hand because I did run out of this delicious frosting within about half way throw 40cupcakes with a generous amount.

Not sure if it was me or the recipe, I'm assuming I did something wrong.  I made it according to the recipe instructions and put it in a piping bag.  First 1/4 cup or so came out so running, I couldn't even make a shell border.  Then I couldn't squeeze hard enough to get the "hard" icing out.  I'm talking stiff as a board!  I also found it rather gritty and VERY sweet.  I will stick to my regular buttercream recipe next time.  The only reason I used this one, is because I didn't make enough of my own and didn't have more high-ratio shortening to make more.  I won't use this one again.  Sorry.

The taste was good but the consistency with using a whole stick of butter (or 1/2 cup) probably wouldn't work. I used only about half a stick of butter, melted which is half of what is listed above. The consistency was good with this version but I would add maybe more confectionary sugar or less butter to stiffen it enough for cake deorating.

Fantastic buttercream!!!  I don't like the taste of icing with shortening in it?  This whips up beautifully and if you are decorating a cake, this works great in a piping bag and holds up well!!  I cut out a little bit of vanilla and substituted with almond oil.  Great flavor! I highly recommend this one.  I refrigerated the Bday cake I made and pulled it out the next morning.  It warmed up well too.  Doesn't make enough.  You should definitely double, if not tripple the recipe.  I trippled the last time I made 2 boxes of cupcakes.

I use this frosting with Scottley's yellow cake recipe and a cream puff center for the middle layer.  Really buttery..but good.  Would also be good using 3/4 cup of butter and a 1/4 cup of shortening to lighten the buter taste.

Excellent recipe!  I'd definately recommend doubling it as it's so easy and you really want to make sure you have enough.  I used this recipe for a double layer 8" cake and doubled it.  It made over 900ml.  Enough for me to have some left over for a future batch of cookies or cupcakes.

Doubled the recipe to frost 24 cupcakes and had plenty left. Flavored with kahlua. Piping shapes was okay as long as they were pretty flat. When I tried for more volume, the shapes sagged.

very delicious frosting...but VERY rich! i have to say, the butter in the frosting was a touch too much; it made the frosting very greasy. so i would just reduce the butter amount. other than that, this was great!

This turned out bad for me. The consistency was grainy - as if I had used granulated sugar. (I followed the recipe exactly, however.) I kept needing to put it in the fridge to harden up so I could spread it without it melting - and my kitchen wasn't even warm. I added extra powdered sugar and it helped a little. Even after the additional sugar I needed to chill the bowl of frosting and the half-frosted cake every 5 minutes or so to keep it's shape. The taste wasn't bad - but it was just so hard to work with.

I made a two layer cake (peanut butter chocolate, on this site) and used this as both the filler and frosting. The first batch I made I tried to make it darker by adding some black food coloring and a little bit more cocoa, which I guess was a mistake because when it hardened it was really hard (but worked for the filling, I guess). The second batch was perfect! But it only covered the top of my cake, so then I made a THIRD batch for the sides of my cake. Well, it tasted great! Really rich and looks gorgeous. Great frosting/icing, will definitely use again!

Good frosting. Not overly buttery.  It is a little on the sweet side. I paired frosting with a chocolate cake and it cut the sweetness a little. Will make again.

The first time I made this recipe it was too runny for spreading. The second time I only added as much milk as I needed until it reached the thickness I like, which was less than 1 tablespoon. I also reduced the vanilla because it was way too strong.

This  the best buttercream recipe by far! No need to spend $1.49-1.89 for store bought icing ever again. What's great too , is that this recipe can be "doctored" up to make different flavored icing! I used a half tub of 10 oz frozen strawberries (drained)in a variation just this morning. (be careful of how much juice you add from the strawberries, may make your icing too runny) Goes fantastic with the Strawberry cake recipe that's on  here too!

Really beautiful, delicious frosting/icing.  Make sure you beat for the 3-4 minutes after adding the milk to get it fluffy.

Stuck to the recipe as I usually like to do the first time and it was delicious! I used it to decorate a birthday cake and it was easy to work with. Perfect in my opinion and everyone loved it. I will use this from now on!  If you plan on icing an entire cake and having some to decorate with, might want to double . There wouldn't have been enough to ice a 13x9 cake plus decorating. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe!  I didn't have confectioners sugar, so I used granulated sugar, and it worked fine!  (I blended the sugar in a food processor for a few minutes first)  The only changes that I made were that I used a little more butter and 3 tablespoons of milk.  I added 2 tablespoons dark chocolate cocoa, and it's delicious!  Great recipe!

WILL ALWAYS USE THIS- I'm nevr buying store bought again!! I've always had problems making my own icing (usual came out too runny or way too sweet)... but I decided to give it another go, and boy am I glad I did. Super light and fluffy. I had to ice the cupcakes quickly for fear of me eating the entire bowl of sugary-goodness!! HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!

Be sure you use white vanilla if you want white frosting.  The frosting was good.  Nothing special.  I used it on a boxed Devil's Food Cake and really the whole thing was pretty tasteless.  It added good moisture to the cake and was not overly sweet.

I didn't have unsalted butter so I'm giving this an additional star based on not following the recipe as directed.  My results were more like a 3 star recipe.  The flavor wasn't that great.  The consistancy wasn't what I was looking for.  I doubled the recipe and I still didn't have nearly enough to pipe icing on 24 cupcakes.  I was laying it on thick but I still only covered 12.

I love this recipe!!  It does not leave a greasy film like the buttercream recipes with shortening.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla and it still turned out great.

I never made icing for a birthday cake before--it came out great just like the store kind.  I made it for my boyfriend's "jeep" cake and it's great for sticking little pieces of things to the cake to make it look like a real jeep.  Even the "side mirrors" hung on nicely.

This recipe is the best basic sugar cookie recipe there is. Make sure that you use PURE vanilla extract for a great tasting cookie. Almond extract and coconut extract are also very delicious, too!

It's average, at best. Maybe I just don't like buttercream. I found the taste too sweet. However; I did find that this was definitely good for piping...not runny at all (as some of the other reviewers said). Will not likely make this again.

It's the "real butter" that makes this so good, smooth and yummy.  It's the base I use for all frostings.

This was just right! I used to to frost a hedgehog cake that I topped with chocolate buttons, so I did add about 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder to make it chocolate (and I used almond extract in place of vanilla). I used the rest on some cupcakes because I wouldn't dare throw it away, it was that good!

Great frosting recipe! I wasn't sure it was going to stand up against my "former" buttercream icing recipe, but it was a hit with myself and my husband who doesn't like overly sweet icing. My kids couldn't get enough of taste tasting for me--enough said. Awesome!

perfect! instead of vanilla i divided the consistency into 3 bowls and added some mint flavouring, orange and also strawberry, along with some food colouring. They turned out really pretty and the taste was great! I doubled the recipe and only got to frost 16 cupcakes though. will definately use this recipe again !

I really whipped up this frosting. Added cinnamon and nutmeg for a chunky spiced apple cake. 1x recipe will definitely frost a 9x13 cake. If you whip it well, it is not greasy at all. I used 1/2&1/2 in place of milk. Excellent.

Very tasty and easy as this was my first attempt at my own icing.  However, I had to double the recipe in order to ice a small cake.  Next time I'll add more sugar to make stiffer...my piping was scary!

Consistancy was awesome.. but i didn't like the taste of the heavy cream!!  Still yummy, but I am going to try to make it even better!! Thinking about maybe using a chocolate or vanilla creamer instead!

perfect and easy! in order to give the icing a little more structure without taking away from taste, i substitute a small portion of the butter with crisco, that way it hold shape better but still has that homely taste butter adds to icing.

GREAT RECIPE! I made a few changes to meet my childrens dietary needs. Instead of butter I used spectrum organic all vegetable shortening...palm oil, and I used confectionary sugar with tapioca flour instead of cornstarch, (found at whole foods) Then milk I used rice milk! My kids have never had frosting, this was great for my daughters 4th birthday! Thanks for posting it!!

I really didn't care for this icing.  It lacked any flavor, and I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I gave it  2 stars because the texture was perfect and the finished cake looked very lovely.  But it's lacking in flavor.

Thank you so much for posting this.  I am a good cook but have no experience baking.  I tripled this recipe, divided it to add color, and made a perfect Elmo cake using the Elmo cake pan they have every where.  Everyone loved the cake.  This is great buttercream.  Since there is no shortening it doesn't taste gross -like Crisco.  This recipe is a keeper.  Again I tripled it without a problem and had maybe 1 1/2 - 2 cups left over which I froze.

i used this recipe on my daughter's 11th bday cake.  It was a hit.  My daughter's practically fought over the leftover cake.  It was so yummy and simple to make. I will never use store bought frosting again.

Used this as a trial buttercream icing for my daughter's castle cake. I'll more likely use it because it doesn't include shortening. :) *UPDATE* Used this buttercream to make my Santa and Frosty Frozen Butter Cream Transfer. Worked great and I used regular sandwich bags.

Awesome!  I didn't have to make any changes and it turned out well.  I poured it over a chocolate zucchini cake.  Delicious!

Delicious, not too sweet icing.  Easy to make.  I didn't need the full amount of milk-- it always works best to add a little at a time with frostings.  I made 1.5 times the recipe (12 servings) and had more than enough to frost 12 cupcakes.

I made this recipe as is to ice a batch of cupcakes, and it turned out perfectly.  It's MUCH better than store-bought icing, and I will make it again.  Thanks.

I really liked this recipe, but the frosting came out too sweet. Since I was making a larger batch. (32 servings) I had to add a teaspoon of lemon juice to get rid of some of the sweetness. You can not taste the lemon and the frosting is delicious.

This recipe is definitely a five star for flavor and quality but I gave it four stars because I tripled the recipe just to ice a two layer 9 in round cake. Although, as a request I made my dad a raspberry jam filled cake for his birthday and this recipe worked perfectly! I used 4 tbls of icing and 2 tbls of red raspberry seedless jam, stirred them together and put them in the fridge for about 20 minutes and it was a hit! I used the recipe for "Heavenly White Cake" as well everyone loved it and I already have requests for more lol! Thanks for the amazing recipe and God Bless!

This is the first frosting I have ever made and it was simple and delicious! It was enough to adequately cover a small cake, but in the future I might double in as well just to be on the safe side.

Great frosting. I am a novice cake maker.  This frosting had such a wonderful consistency that I was inspired to fire up a bag with a tip and it piped beautifully.  I've never had success with that before so thanks for the recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly except I added chopped Oreo's at the end to top a chocolate cake.  Result was a delicious icing of perfect consistancy and taste!  As stated in the recipe, I used a wooden spoon and I think that helped give the recipe the right consistancy.

Very good!  I use this recipe all the time.  Only change is that I put in less milk so that it's stuff enough to pipe.  The recipe makes a very small amount. I usually make 4x for a cake

I am a novice baker, but I found this recipe easy to follow with wonderful results.  The icing was fluffy and delicate, I used it on cupcakes and my kids loved it.  For me, it was a bit too sweet and I am going to try reducing the sugar the next time.  Otherwise, wonderful recipe.

This is my first time giving reviewing, but I must thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I made the icing for my baby girl's birthday cupcakes and it turns out really nice and yummy. The icing holds very well and I was able to leave it in the open for 3 hours and it was still of a good consistency for piping, the kids at the party was able to  decorate their cupcakes effortlessly.

This made perfect icing for the birthday cake I made for my husband today.  He LOVES buttercream icing and this was smooth, tasty, and just right for the chocolate cake.  It wouldn't work for decorating very well because of all the butter, but it is delicious and easy to smooth out on the cake

The taste was okay, but the icing was way too thin, even with adding extra powdered sugar.  And like another reviewer said, the icing seemed to seperate if you stop mixing it.

The Kids and I made cupckes and were looking for s mock-buttercream. This was perfect! Due to some little heavy-handed vanilla & milk helpers we ended up with a frosting that was a little too loose, but some extra sugar would have fixed that. It was very easy and tasted great!

Excellent recipe. I made this for my husbands 50th B-day along with a cake from this site and This was the 1st time I made homemade frosting. Followed it exactly but added SMUCKERS strawberry preserves to it. Came out perfect. It's a keeper-got rave reviews from the hubby and family! Thank you for sharing.

Well, I am only giving this recipe three stars because of the taste; if I were judging strictly on the consistency, I would have given it at least four stars, if not five. For some reason, the taste was just not what I was expecting, as it didn't have that "professional" flavor that I was looking for. I am wondering if the taste would have been better if regular butter had been used and not unsalted. I would like to try that method and see what happens.

Great recipe!  I followed exactly and it tasted wonderful.  Also tried it with 1/2 tsp almond extract added to the recipe, and that was great as well.

I tried this recipe and only added half the precribed vanilla and the other half almond extract.  The flavor was good but there was WAY too much of it.  I will try it tonight with only vanilla and see the difference.  Otherwise it was perfectly delicious and I will use it as a base for my own icing recipe!  I will probably half the flavor, add salt and add sugar to pipe decorations

Followed the recipe exactly, using a stand mixer. The icing turned out rather fluffy and smooth. Great for icing cakes, but probably not the best for piping/decorating. Of course, with a little adjustment I think it would work fine. The consistency I came up with was kind of like out of a tub, of course it tasted much better!

I thought this was excellent just the right amount of sweetness. It was not quite enough to cover a 3 layer cake. Very easy to make thank you.

I have always used canned frosting to ice my cakes and cupcakes GASP i know! haha so this was my first try at making buttercream icing and I have to say this was so easy and came out perfect! I am going to be using this from now on! I am waiting for my cupcakes to cool and have my frosting in a bag with a tip ready to decorate. I am going to recommend this to my friend who is also an avid baker. I followed this recipe exactly and it was the right consistency. I would recommend refridgerating after because it seemed like it would be too creamy to frost a cupcake without getting it everywhere!

This was absolutely delicious. Other frosting recipes I have tried on here have tasted too buttery, but not this one. When I tasted it I literally yelped it was so good. A couple of things...one batch is NOT enough.  You need double for a two layer cake, and probably two and a half if you plan to do alot of piping/decorating.  Adding food coloring will make runny so add more sugar to account for that. Other than that, this is the best recipe ever!

Wow, this one was pretty good. I think I added too much butter so that was an error on my part. Very tasty, creamy, and very good texture. They were great on the cupcakes I made. The name says it all. Nothing wrong with 'almost' :)

I found this frosting to be really thin, and difficult to use in a frosting bag... However, it could be because I added 10 liquid food coloring drops to get the lavender color I wanted. At any rate, this tasted and worked great after I added about 1 cup more confectioners sugar.

In a pinch I quickly whipped this up and it was divine!  Reminded me of the icing on the cakes from the expensive bakeries.
Will keep this one!

This is a wonderful easy recipe that will make any dessert taste great.  I used this for sugar cookie frosting but will be using it for cakes as well in the future.  For the cookies I doubled the recipe and it was enough to cover about 5 dozen large sugar cookies (by kids so probably used more than was needed for each cookie). The kids all loved it and it was creamy and easy for even a 3 year old to spread on cookies.  I may try adding a bit of peppermint extract next time to add some holiday flavor but it was great just as is.  The only concern I have was with the coloring of the frosting.  I used food coloring but frosting colors would make it much more vibrant.

I just finished making this one minute ago.  I tried a sugar cooking icing recipe and thought it was disgusting.  You saved me!  I've been looking for the perfect butter cream recipe.   This is so awesome!  I couldn't even wait to put it on my cookies.   I had to post a review right away.   Thanks so much!!

It was really runny, probably because I only had spreadable butter, so I ended up adding way more sugar than the recipe says.  As a result it tasted too sugary.  I added cocoa powder to cut the sweet and it made a nice chocolate icing.  I saved some of the running icing and it made a nice drizzle. The flavor was really good, so I am sure real butter would have fixed everything.

After reading the reviews, I was excited about the icing, but the end result is your standard buttercream.  I was a little disappointed, but maybe that's my own fault for psyching myself up for it.  It's good icing, but not phenomenal.
