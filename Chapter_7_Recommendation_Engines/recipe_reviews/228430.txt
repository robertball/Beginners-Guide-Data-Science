These turned out really well. Even with half whole wheat flour, they rose nicely and my family all enjoyed them!

I used 2 tbsp olive oil instead of the shortening, and "baked" the pita bread two at a time (to avoid running the oven in the summer), covered in my electric skillet for a couple minutes on each side till they got browned spots. 

They came out read good and disappeared in a day.

I just made these and followed the directions to a T.  It was a little waiting game but the result was the freshest, tastiest pitas we've ever tasted; my 6 y.o. ate 2 and wanted more!  Thank you!

The trick to puffing up is using your hands not the rolling pin! Don't press them out with your fingers! They will not puff up.

Nice, simple recipe!  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, and I sprinkled corn meal on the baking sheet which worked out really well.  After throwing the first few pitas in the oven I accidentally realized that allowing the individual pitas to rise for a third time (after rolling out) ended up making nice, solid pockets and a firmer outer shell.  Definitely tasty and will save this recipe for later!

I could only get 3 of these to "puff" up in the oven.  The others were flat. Taste was great!

Great dough. I used 2 tbs of active dry yeast and added 1 tsp of sugar. I made them on the stovetop, on a hot oiled griddle. Taste it great.

Great recipe. I have not changed a thing and it all turned out fantastic! Better served fresh since they tend to get brittle after a while.

I *almost feel bad giving this four stars because it does taste really good and would be great for dipping in hummus or tzatziki however, most of mine didn't have a pocket which was a let down since I made them to fill with falafel. I'm going to continue hunting for a recipe with a better chance of success in the pocket area.

My kids really loved them. They were easy to make. The only change I made was replacing vegetable shortening with lard because it's the only thing I had.

This is a great recipe! I was so impressed by how the pitas turned out and so easy! My brother came home and saw them on the counter as asked if he could try one. He could not believe that I made them! Great recipe!

This was my first time making pita bread!These were defiantly easy enough to make! mine turned out ok a little to fluffy. I thought I rolled them thin enough but I guess not...:(  they tasted Fantastic! Im going to try making them again because im sure it was my fault they didn't turn  out as thin as I would have liked! but they sure are yummy!

Perfect pitas! Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. Have been searching for a pita recipe through all my traditional cookbooks.  Thanks Dennis!  My search is over.  So simple to make.

I used compressed, instant yeast.  Worked like a charm.  The pita tasted great.  Unfortunately, baking the pita doesn't produce the nice burnt spots that I'd like.  My only complaint was that they were difficult to peel open after slicing them down the middle.
