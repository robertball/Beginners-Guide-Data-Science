I thought this was incredible!  I did make a few adjustments to the original recipe.  I used a three pound rump roast, only two packages (.67 oz each) of italian dressing mix and I put the entire jar and juices of the pepperoncini in with the roast from the get go.  I cooked it on high in the crockpot for 4 hours and then on low for 4-5 hours.  The meat just fell apart!  It was absolutley incredible!  I used french bread instead of buns, which I buttered and placed in a pan to brown.  I put some juice into a small bowl to dip the sandwich in.  Thank you for the recipe!

I've tried this twice, once using the recommended ingredients, and once cutting the Italian mix to 1 oz and draining the pepperoncinis thoroughly before adding. I also used beer instead of water. The changes made a delicious Italian beef. The original recipe is far too salty.

We loved this recipe!  Extremely easy.  Changes for our tastes were:  We like spicey foods so I added another half jar of pepperoncinis--juice and all.   Added all peppers in half way thru the cooking process: after about 3-4 hours so the flavor soaked into beef.  Used 2 instead of 3 dressing mixes (from the advice of others). Brushed the hoagies very lightly with olive oil,   spinkled a bit of garlic powder & salt on them, toasted then added shredded meat and provolone & broiled until melted--(toasting the hoagies helped prevent them from getting too soggie when juice was poured over them) .  Put the hoagies in a bowl, added pepperoncinis to taste and laddled the unbelievable great juice over it.  Excellent!!!  I did go to great lengths after the meat was done to pull it out and shred it to make sure all the fat was removed and this took a LONG time. But this is not necessary just my preference.

WOW - so simple and so delicious! This has to be one of the easiest and tastiest crock pot recipes ever! What's great about it too is it's very inexpensive and makes a lot. I added about 2 tsp. of minced garlic from the jar and used only 2 (1 ounce) packed of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix. Instead of a whole cup of water I used about 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar to cut heat from the peppers and to cover more of the roast. I also added two vidalia onions that I quarted and added half way through cooking. I cooked this on low for 8 hours and the smell was heavenly. We served this on toasted hoagie rolls with provolone cheese. Everyone loved it! Thanks Randi for a great recipe!

This is it! I'm from Chicago and since I do not  live there now, I forever crave THE Italian Beef sandwich. Only Chicagoans know what I'm talkin' 'bout. This recipe is as close as it gets. I read the other reviews first and altered the recipe accordingly. I bought a 1.75 lb. chuck roast. I used 2 C of Beef stock instead of water, 1 packet of dry italian italian salad dressing mix, 1/2 jar of pepperoncini juice (served the peppers on the side), 3 bulbs of garlic and I threw in some italian seasoning and addt'l Oregano. I could not insult this recipe by putting it on a hamburger bun, so I found some great pane rolls at the bakery and they were perfect. I cooked on high for 4 hrs and 2 more hours on low. My husband said this was the best tasting roast meat he has ever had. I will be making this recipe again and again. Thank you!!!

Really Good!  I used all 3 of the Italian seasoning packets, which were .68 oz each, and it was perfect for us.  I used a cup of beer instead of the water.  I don't like real spicy food, so I added about 1/3 of the jar of peppers and a couple tablespoons of the juice.  This was just right for our tastes- a little kick at the end, but mellow enough for the kids. Club rolls suited the beef perfectly. I'll be making this again for sure.

This recipe really rocks - it was so good that we made it twice in one week. 3 packs of dressing mix seems like a lot, but do yourself a favor and just follow the recipe - it turns out great. The 2nd time we made this, we did as some reviewers suggest and added the pepperoncini right at the beginning. It was not as good, so we will follow Randi's recipe as it is written going forward. Try it on top of baked potatoes too. Very Good!

My mom found this recipie on here a couple of years ago.  We do it a bit diffrently and have amazing results.  In a crock pot place the roast cover with 1 pkg of Italian dressing mix 1cup beef broth and add the peppers juice and all. Cover and slow cook all day.

I used 2 packets of italian dressing seasoning and it came out strongly (but perfectly) flavored. 3 would have been an overkill! Made this for my husband and his friends. After it was done, I broiled the hoagie buns, topped with this beef, and then a slice of provolone, and then put it back under the broiler till it was bubbly and done. Yum.

This is a great recipe for a base for italian beef.  I only use 2 packets of the salad dressing, 1 12 oz beer, 1 cup beef broth, can of french onion soup and 1/2 jar of mild banana peppers.  We like alot of broth in our italian beef and I find if you don't use much liquid the next day when reheating it can be quite dry.  I also use my nesco for this dish.  Delish

This recipe is very easy and it is absolutely delicious! I made this for my family and they asked me to make it again right away. The first time I made it, I used the beef in a meal along with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. This time I'm making the sandwiches with it. Thank you for this great recipe, it has become one of our family favorites.

My husband and I LOVED this!  My roast was around 2.7 lbs. and I only used 2 packets of Italian seasoning and added the peppers to taste, no juice.  We put provolone cheese on some hoagie buns and broiled them to toast the bread and melt the cheese.  We raved about them all through dinner!  I served it with a spinach strawberry salad and homemade baked french fries.
ALSO:  I try to share this secret with as many people as possible - when your meat is ready to be shredded, if you have a stand mixer (kitchen aid, bosch, etc)  put your meat in your bowl with your basic paddle attachment and turn it on low.  Your meat will be shredded in 20 seconds instead of slaving away with forks.

I've used the dry Italain dressing mix in recipes before and found it way too salty for my taste. So, I made this recipe with a 2 lb roast, a 12 oz jar of pepperoncini, 2 cans of beef broth (can be low sodium), 1 TBL of Italian seasoning, 1 TBL oregano, and a few garlic cloves. I seasoned the roast with a little salt, and more generously with black pepper and granulated garlic. I cooked it for about 7 hours on high and it fell apart nicely. Try serving it on toasted French or Italian rolls brushed with garlic butter. I also add provolone cheese and sauteed sweet peppers. YUM!

One suggestion that I would make to others is to use a sirloin tip roast rather than a chuck roast, making sure to give it plenty of time to slow cook. Using a sirloin tip roast eliminates all the fat and gristle that is common with a chuck roast, while still being a juicy and delicious piece of meat. As for the recipe, I’ve had better Italian beef in my day. While it was palatable, it was also little on the salty side when made as written. Next time I would add some dried herbs (oregano, Italian seasoning, etc) and back off of the dressing mixes by at least one packet if not two. Loved the peppers though!

Excellent recipe and easy.  I use a can of beef broth instead of water and I add the peppers and juice at the beginning instead of at the end.  I also use Hoagie rolls instead of hamburger buns. We top the sandwich off with Mozzarella and sliced up peppers. Perfect every time!

YUMMY!  Everyone in the house loved it.  I made own italian dressing spices from this website, and I added two beef boullion cubes. This is the one your looking for.   Here are the spices in case anyone else needs them. 2 T garlic salt, 2 T  onion powder, 2 T sugar, 2 T oregano, 2 t black pepper, 1 t red pepper, 1/2 t thyme, 2 t basil, 2 T parsley, 1/2 t celery salt (i used celery flakes), 2 T salt.  1/2 t lemon pepper (someone else mentioned it so I threw it in) I used these on a 3 pound roast,and it was perfect.  Fed 2 teenage boys, 1 hungry husband, 1 hungry 8 yr. old, and 1 picky meat eater...it was delicious.

This is really good. I modify it just a bit by using Campbell's condensed beef broth, sauteed onions and half a jar of the pepperoncini peppers with half the juice. I serve this on toasted rolls with provolone cheese melted over the top. NOTE: If you have extra "au jus" from this recipe, it makes a great base for beef stew so don't waste it. Either make your stew the next day OR freeze it in a marked container for when you do make stew.

this is always a crowd pleaser. I can't wait to put a hunk of sharp provolone on my sandwich later at pot luck. I am thinking it will be great on my super spicy italian beef sammie.

I've made this same recipe several times and I love it. I do add my whole jar of peppercinis at the start with the juice and all to help flavor the meat. This is also a great way to cook deer meat roast. I'm not a huge fan of deer meat but slow cooking it with the Italian seasoning makes for NO gamey taste at all. I also serve mine with provolone cheese and mayo on a hoagie bun. I've never toasted them but I will next time!

So easy and so delicious!  I use an entire can of beer instead of water and put the entire jar of pepperoncinis in at the beginning.  Serve with a crusty bread.

This was FREAKING AMAZING. Do yourself a favor and make this--exactly as written. Don't change anything. You won't be disappointed. I used a rump roast and served on toasted hoagie buns! We ate this 3 days in a row until it was gone, and STILL wanted more! I used about a quarter of the juice in the jar and it was perfectly spiced for us.

this was so yummy, my husband couldn't stop eating! I added the pepperoncini right in the beginning along with about 1/2 the juice. You have to like a spicy meat because it was definitely that!

Fantastic!  We let it cook on the stove over night and it is so tender and falls apart. We sliced a half jar of pepperocinis and added the juice from the whole jar.    Highly recommended

Used beef broth instead of water, but other than that followed as written and it was out of this world yummy.

Loved this recipe, easy and delicious:)  Had my parents over and my dad had 2 sandwiches.  I used 2 packets of Italian dressing as most had suggested.  I added the peppers in with a little juice right away and cooked on medium for 7 hours, in my slow cooker.

Wonderful!!  I cooked the pepperocini's with the meat and seasoning the whole time though and it gave the meat a great flavor and we dipped the sandwiches in the remaining juices like au jus.  So good!  Thanks for sharing!

Great flavor and super easy.  I used 2 dressing packets and a full jar of peppers.  Although the meat was flavorful, there was very little au jus.  I'll add some beef broth next time.  Thanks!

I really wanted to give this 4-1/2 stars, but there's no button for that. I know real Italian Beef from Chicago and this is pretty close, but not quite there. I made a few modifications and that knocked down my rating. Instead of water, I used a full 2 cups of beef broth. Real Italian Beef is very wet. I also used a rump roast instead of chuck because it was on sale. I don't think there was any difference. I used only half a jar of pepperoncinos and only about half a cup of its juice. I'd rather allow diners to add some heat if they want. Also, I added some garlic and a little oregano and basil. And finally I recommend using hoagie or deli rolls instead of hamburger buns, that would make it more like the real thing. By the way, my favorite place in Chicago is Mr. Beef on Erie. Beats the beter known Al's in my opinion. This is a good version. I look forward to trying it again and adding my favorite extra - an Italian Sausage link.

This stuff is amazing!  Instead of water I used 1 can of beef broth.  I also only had 2 packages of italian seasoning so I added about 1/2 cup zesty italian dressing to it.  Served it on rolls with swiss cheese.  This will be made often! Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  The flavor was great.  I did use only 2 packets of the Italian dressing mix as others suggested.  I didn't use the entire jar of pepper, probably half.  The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star rating is because my juices were gone and it was a tad on the dry side.  I will had a little more water next time.

I had no idea what pepperoncini peppers were and it took awhile to find them (check by the pickles & jalapeno peppers), but it was worth it.  Great flavor, but very spicy - we picked out all the peppers and even still it was a bit much for the kids (elementary & high school age) but just about right for me.  I put the peppers in at the beginning just for ease.  If you're not sure about the flavor you might try adding half the amount of peppers.  It got rave reviews from those we shared it with too.

Super easy recipe! My husband 'prepared' everything before leaving for work and when we got home, the delicious aroma was waiting for us. Fantastic meal for those nights you know you won't have the time or energy to prepare anything else. Super easy cleanup also! We'll be keeping this one for sure.

I wanted to love this recipe, I've been dying to make it for awhile. Unfortunately, I don't think the flavors worked very well together.  I want to play around with the idea of this recipe though, I think it could be a wonderful dish.

I absolutely loved this...it was awesome. I made it exactly as posted except that I added the pepperoncini and juice right at the beginning. I cooked it on low for 10 hours overnight while I was at work and when I came home, the  aroma made my mouth water. I was not disappointed!! The meat just fell apart and there was plenty of juice to serve on the side for dipping if desired. The only other thing that I did which the recipe really didn't specify was that I seared the meat all over to brown it before adding it to the crockpot. Thanks for an awesome and easy recipe!

This has been in my recipe box for some time, and I finally decided to give a try - I am so glad that I did.  It is wonderful!  I used the Italian Salad Dressing mix recipe that is on this site, and a little zesty italian dressing - mixed in half of the pepperoncini & juices halfway into cooking, and then the rest right after shredding, then let it cook about 30 more minutes.  I served it on the Soft Onion Sandwich Rolls from this site & some melted provolone, and it was sensational.  I do not think that standard hamburger rolls would do this recipe justice.  I strained the meat from the juice, and served the juice alongside as an au jus, and it made it even better.  I will definatly be making this one again and again!

Sooo good.  I made a few changes based on a friend's recommendations on how she makes hers.  I used one Italian seasoning packet since other reviewers said it was salty.  I added part of the jar of pepperocinis at the beginning of cooking then added the rest later  to taste.  I also cooked it on low for 12 hours.  It was like butter.  Another friend suggested a rump roast - I'm going to give that a shot next time.  The chuck was fantastic though, and I've having trouble giving away the majority that I promised to a friend.  Definitely a keep recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe that has garnered raves!  Have made a few tweaks.  I only add 2 packages of the Italian dressing mix and reserve the third, use beef broth in place of the water, and add 4 to 5 cloves of garlic before slow cooking.  Once the beef is tender, I remove it from the slow cooker and shred it and mash the garlic cloves with it, adding enough of the cooking liquid and the reserved dry Italian dressing mix to taste (thus avoiding the "too salty" dilemma).  I slice onions very thin and put in a shallow bowl with enough of the crock pot liquid to cover, put plastic over the top and nuke for 1-2 minutes (until tender) - great flavor!  Melt provolone cheese on toasted rolls and serve with onions and pepperoncini - perfection!  Thanks, Randi!

There aren't enough stars to rate this.  I suspected it would be good, but this was simply amazing.  I did put the pepperoncinis in the pot from the beginning.  I also used the Itallian Dressing Mix from this site.  The results were amazing.  I ate way too much and my husband absolutely loved it.  So simple to put together too.  This recipe will definitely become a staple. Thanks!

Awesome and simple recipe.    I have made this twice and found that adding the water was not necessary.    I make a double batch and put the leftovers in the freezer which tastes marvelous.

This is the recipe I've always used w/ a couple small changes - I use two seasoning packets and rub them into the meat before putting in the slow cooker. Instead of water, I use one can of beer. Gives it a little extra kick. I also put everything in the slow cooker all at once (instead of waiting to put the pepperoncinis in later). Instead of hamburger buns, I serve the beef on those little Pillsbury french rolls from the freezer section. They make the perfect sized hearty finger sandwiches. Add on a 1/2 slice of provolone cheese, and you're set!  Also, you should note that different brand names of peppercinis have different spicy-ness. I usually go for the mild one, but some brands don't offer a mild version.  People ALWAYS ask me for the recipe and it's SO easy!

I felt very generous giving this recipe 1 star.  It is NOT Italian beef, at least not the real stuff.  The real stuff originated in Chicago and if you ever had it, you'd know just how far off the mark this recipe is.  
I will thank my roommate for his attempt to cook Italian beef.  I made him the real stuff and he couldn't believe the difference.  
If you're extremely hungry and have a chunk of beef on hand, then maybe try this recipe, otherwise, stick to the real thing.

Since several people complained about the salt levels, I only used one package of Italian dressing mix.  I browned my roast before placing in the slow cooker.  I then added 3 smashed cloves of garlic and 1 onion sliced to flavor the drippings.  This gave the beef a lot of flavor without being salty.  I used crusty kaiser rolls instead of hamburger buns; they can hold up to the juices better than the buns.

This really is a winner.  I make enough for 60 people when I make it at my Elks lodge and they rave.  I get my bread from a local bakery or from Philly.  I substitute beer for the water and add some canned tomatoes, onion soup mix and garlic.  I also serve it with provolone.

We've tried a number of 'italian beef' recipes from this site, and this is by far the easiest.  And it's absolutely delicious too.  I used four 0.7oz Good Seasons packets (the biggest I could find).  We spooned the au jus into individual bowls and added a little of the pepper juice then dunked our sandwiches.  The other recipes have called for the peppers to be added early in the cook time, but I liked them this way, still crunchy and zesty.

Pretty good! While not my favorite Italian beef and not nearly as good as the stuff I can get locally (I live in Chicagoland, home of the original Italian beef), this is decent nonetheless. I like to use my slow cooker when I am planning to be gone all day. Because my hubs and I spent most of our day car shopping, this suited us perfectly. :) NOTE: I did not find this to be overly salty at all (and I used the full amount of seasoning called for). I pretty much followed Randi's directions to the letter with the exception of one minor substution - instead of water, I added a 12 oz. bottle of Fat Tire beer (to add a little more depth / flavor). NOTE: If you plan to top your sandwich with a few pepperonicini pepeprs, BE SURE TO REMOVE THE STEMS BEFORE ADDING TO YOUR SLOW COOKER! Served on toasted onion rolls with melted provolone cheese on top, these were not bad at all. I actually think I liked the leftovers better! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Randi!

Being from the Chicago-land area, I had high hopes. They were dashed a bit, but I think the recipe is GOOD, but I read the reviews and used some beer instead of water. Also, I was not happy w/ the French bread I used. Those 2 things were certainly not the fault of the recipe. If I could get a Gonnella bread here, I think that would work well. But, it was pretty good!!!!  Leftovers tonight were just as good!

Randi,same as you I've had this recipe for years, from mom!  I have changed it over the years and thought I'd share.  For those of you with last minute meal plans, the chuck roast can be put in crock pot frozen, 2 pkg. Italain dressing mix, 1T. Oregano, 3/4T. basil, 2 Cloves garlic, minced,1 can beef broth instead of water and 3 whole pepperoncinis.  7-8hrs on med/low.  Served on any crusty roll with melted mozzarella and sliced pepperonci's!  Yum...

I was actually a bit surprised at this recipe. I really expected to love it, as I'm a SUPER fan of roast beef...this had all the right "stuff" for me, all the ingredients are favorites of mine. It just didn't come together in the end in a way that impressed me much. I still ate three sandwiches, though, so...!

Ummmm ummmm good! I couldn't find 1oz pkgs. of italian so I used 4 .07 oz of Good Seasonings Italian. After reading some of the reviews, I also added half the peppers while cooking and added the rest the last hour. Brushed sub buns with a little butter on both sides and melted provolone cheese. My family stated this is one of their favorites. My husband took leftovers to work and they all requested the recipe. Oh, one more thing.... this is great for a larger family! It's not often I have leftovers with four teenage boys in the house. It's also inexpensive. Ten stars!!!!

I've made this for my husband a few times (I am a vegetarian) and he LOVES it. He's used to eating the roast you cook in the crock pot for hours, and season through the day - and he said this is better. I am from Chicago and have seen/smelled a lot of Italian beef. This looks and smells just like the real stuff! This recipe stays on our FAVORITES - recipe made exactly according to the instructions.

This was really good. The French bread is a MUST. Any kind of soft bread like a hamburger bun or a soft hoagie will just get soggy and turn to mush. French bread is perfect for sopping up all of that delicious juice and it doesn't turn to mush in your hands while you're trying to eat it. I followed the recipe but made the following changes. I added two packets of no-sodium beef bouillon to the first cup of water, and only two packets of Italian dressing. Halfway through cooking, I took the meat out and shredded it. Added another pack of no-sodium bouillon, about a half cup of water and half of a third Italian dressing packet. I kept sprinkling it to taste. I cooked it from 11am until around 7pm, occasionally stirring and checking the broth to make sure it was not overly salty. It was perfect! The bouillon adds a good richness to the broth. Also, I added the entire jar of peppers with their juice, but I pulled the stems off first. This was a hit, will definitely make it again.

Love this but did tweak a little.... Added a can of beer, a beef bouillon cube & a jar of green olives as well as the pepperoncini's..... Only used 1 packet of Italian seasoning.  You can use a can of French onion soup or good ole can of beef consommé... It's a NO fail recipe, Dump all in crock pot & waaa lah

Yes, I would make this again. But its not exactly like chicago's Italian beef. It has the texture of pot roast. Also, next time I will cut back Italian dressing mix to        1 1/2 packets.

I have used this recipe for years....the only thing I do different is I prepare it in a pressure cooker, takes but 25 minutes and is as tender as if you cooked it for hours!Great if you want Italian beef in a hurry! Also I use the juice from the pepperoncini's.

This was pretty good. I used a package and a half of italian seasoning since I used a smaller roast, there are only 2 of us,but I think it could of handled the full two packages. Very, Very easy to make!

This was great, but way too salty with all those seasoning packets- we had a 2.75# chuck roast, and used qty. two .7oz packets of Italian dressing mix- agreed next time we would use only 1 packet. The flavor was fabulous- the saltiness was not. In all, will make again though. UPDATE: Made again with 3# chuck roast & 1 pkt of Italian dressing mix- best Italian beefs EVER!!! 10 stars!!!

Great recipe.  I forgot to get it started before work and my husband ended up making it.  Followed previous comments and used 2 packs of dressing mix.  My husband also added a bottle of beer and about half a jar of mild banana pepper rings, half jar of the juice and a whole medium sliced onion.  It turned out great.  Will definitely be making this again!  Hubby thinks it needs more spice so maybe we'll use the hot pepper rings next time.

I make this at least once a month. Instead of water I add in beef broth. I put everything in crockpot, set and forget it till I get home. I serve it on hoagie style rolls usually.

I've been making this recipe for YEARS, but have never added the peppers - need to try this version.  I do make the change of using a can of chicken broth instead of water (tried beef, but we think the chicken adds a wonderful flavor).   We serve on crusty rolls with provolone and use the broth for dipping like french dips.  Makes great gravy for hot beef sandwiches also.    My grown sons all make this and I tell them chuck roast is a must!  Great recipe!

This is how my mom and I make it.  I love it.  We have never attempted to put the peppers in it to cook, but that sound like a plan.  Don't be afraid to use more water.  I add enough water to cover the meat.  Once the beef is shredded it absorbs alot of it and makes it juicy.  I live in the chicago area and this recipe can compete with the best of them.  Sure it's shredded but the flavor is as good. I cook a bunch and freeze small portions to be eaten later.

This is a sandwich that I crave! I LOVE it. I make it with 1 packet seasoning, fresh garlic, no water and I add the peppers right at the start. Shred and put back in crockpot for half and hour. YUM!! Put in roll, provolone over the top and stick in broiler until cheese bubbles...

I used two packages of italian seasoning (one zesty, one regular) and one package of onion soup mix.  I also added 8 oz. of hot banana pepper rings along with the pepperoncini peppers.

Fantastic! I did take the advice of some of the other reviews and cut down the amount of italian seasoning to one packet.  You can always stir in a little extra after it's all shredded if needed.  

Served it on some crusty rolls w/provalone cheese and extra peppercinis.

Excellent!!!

After reading the reviews here is my take on this recipe.  First I put sliced onions and green bell peppers on the bottom of the   slow cooker.  Then the roast on top.  I also added some fresh mushrooms, the banana peppers and half the juice from them, minced garlic and just one packet of the italian seasoning.  When done cooking I shredded, piled high on some good quality buns topped with provolone and ran under the broiler for a  couple minutes to toast the bread and melt the cheese.  So good!

I've never had italian beef before so I didn't have anything to compare this recipe to. My family went nuts over this. Next time I will add garlic ,oregano, and basil for more of a italian flavor.

Only added one packet of the dry dressing but did use zesty italian and we added the peppers in the beginning, juice and all - beef turned out kinda hot from the peppers but yummy.  Serve on crusty rolls with provolone that we 1st spread with a garlic butter mixed with ranch dressing and it was fabulous.

This was very good! I used a two pound london broil, and after reading the reviews I only used 1 packet of dressing mix and 1/2 jar of pepper juice and 1/2 jar of peppers. Not enough flavoring for us. Next time 2 packets of dressing! My hubsand and 3 year both loved it so it's going to be a repeat for us! I like spice so I added extra peppers to my sandwich.I also seared the roast with a little crushed garlic before throwing in crock pot. Served on toasted rolls with low fat provolone and best food light mayo...YUM!

I made this for an office party today. Only a couple of modifications: I lightly browned the beef first and cooked it in the crock pot overnight on low. (Per other reviews, I put the jar of pepperocini (with juice) in at the same time as the meat. YUMMY. Everyone is asking me for the recipe.

Outstanding recipe. This couldn't be any easier! What a perfect recipe for having a party... after shredding, just leave the beef in the slow cooker on low and let guests make their own sandwiches. I also made Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I from this site and found the cool, sweet slaw to be an awesome match with the spicy sandwich. You can even eat these cold (although they are much better warm. Thank you!

Fantastic and incredibly easy! Since there are only two of us, I used a 3 pound rump roast, 2 bags of Italian seasoning and half a large jar of peppers, liquid included with the water. It simmered for probably a little over 6 hours and shredded like a charm. I'm going to search for a brand of low sodium dressing, but we'll do this again soon. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

I just saw this recipe (08/05/16) on AR, but had a version of it given to me by my D-I-L, which I have made.  It is my favorite sandwich now.  However, I now prefer it made with a pork loin.  It keeps us away from red meat and is awesome!!  The recipe that was given to me, was different in that it called for a 4lb chuck roast, 15 oz can beef broth, 1 pkg Good Season Zesty Italian, 1 T. garlic powder, 8oz jar pepperoncini and 1 stick of butter.  Cook 8 hours on low.  Shredd and put back in pot.  Serve on bread of choice and top with provolone cheese or cheese of choice.  The next time I make it though, I will not use the butter for health reason...don't think it will affect the flavor that much.

I have not been feeling well so my mom made this Italian beef for me. She took the time to trim the fat and it still came out super moist and tender (she did use a better cut of beef which made a huge difference- cuts from the chuck are all hugely different- this was probably a blade roast-not to be confused with the under blade roast-You can remove the connective tissue, which is ugly but perfectly fine to eat. It is tender, full of flavor, and juicy).  She cooked it for four hours on high and the meat was still very tough, so she finished cooking it on low for five more hours, adding the peppers and all of their juice when switching to low. My boyfriend makes a similar recipe, but cooks it overnight for 10 to 12 hours on low, then warms it when time to eat. His just falls apart in your mouth (though it's quite a bit more oily). The flavor is amazing. I  told her that I wanted her to make it again and again. Wonderful recipe!.....ok, she made it again with a lower quality chuck cut  and it wasn't nearly as tender, but the flavor was good-still, this time we were disappointed.******** One note on chuck roasts: if they are cone shaped, they are probably the mock tender muscle - and an inferior cut of chuck, tougher, stringier, and less flavorful.  Another inferior chuck cut is the shoulder-it's chewy and grainy and also lacks flavor. A chuck eye roast is another choice that is juicy and flavorful, but also very fatty. Finally, one more decent roast to try: the top sirloin.

Super Easy and taste amazing! We live in Chicago so we are very picky about our Italian beef. The only thing I changed was using beef broth instead of water other than that I followed the recipe and everyone raved about how good it was. A must try recipe you will not be disappointed.

I always get asked for this recipe. I now carry a copy (took a picture) on my phone. Easy to send to people on the fly. I too put the whole jar of peppers in there from the beginning. I also substitute beef broth for the water. This is so great to freeze the extra in small containers for a quick fix.

This is just excellent. Two Italian seasoning packets are plenty. Before serving, we then toast out buns with butter and garlic powder in the toaster oven. Then we add provolone and broil it until the cheese melts. After that.... Game-time!

This is by far the best Italian beef and the recipe I use.  I do tweak it by adding very thinly sliced onion and several cloves of crushed garlic.  I also add 1 1/2 cups of beef broth for lots of juicy goodness for the buns to soak up.

I make this at least once a month. I use two packages of Italian mix and I put the jar and juice in the beginning. I use a pressure cooker and put it in for about an hour. I toast rolls brushed with olive oil and garlic salt. Amazing!

This is the recipe I've made for years and is hands down the best!!!!  Only thing one should do differently is cook the peppers and the ‘juice’ from the jar in from the onset along with the beef.  Would also suggest serving on a kaiser bun vs hamburger bun which would good get soggy.

I have made this twice. It is very good! I reduced the salad dressing pouch to two instead of three because three pouches made the dish a too salty for my taste.

Tasted awesome & was so easy. Double recipe & used two different kinds of roast was great! Used the recipe for Italian dressing mix on this site & only ended up using what was equal to 4 packets only cause I ran out of certain spices. Still was great!

This is great Sunday meal!  VERY EASY! I put the peppers in when I started it and cooked it on low all night. My family dont like the peppers so I just picked them out and noone was any wiser. My children 4 and 7 asked for me to make it again before they even finished lunch.

Pretty Good.  Added peppers 1/2 way thru cooking.  A little too tart.  Might add less next time

I made my version of this recipe for my Dad this weekend and he absolutely loved it.  I use beer instead of water, and it gives the meat an extra level of flavor.  Different types of beer can be used per your taste (i.e. stout gives it a more intense flavor than a 'light' beer).  I also sliced 2 large vidalia onions and added to the pot along with chopped garlic.  Served on toasted ciabatta rolls with swiss cheese.  Unbelievably good, and so easy!!

We loved it - made it with 2 packages of dry seasoning, and slow cooked it (starting from frozen) for an hour on high, then on low for overnight.

Very good recipe... The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it's a bit too salty with 3pkgs of seasoning mix... 2 would have been fine. Thanks for a great crock pot meal.

This was great!  I made this with the following modifications:  I used two  packets of Italian dressing mix and I used a rump roast.  I'll be making it again. Thanks for a super recipe.

This recipe was nice, very flavorful.  I made this for my family and thought that reducing the peppers to two with no juice would omit the spicy side of this dish, but I was wrong.  My kids could not eat this so I had to make another meal for them. I think this recipe is perfect for crowds. Would make again for a football party.

Yum!  Thanks for sharing!!!
I too cut back on the amount of Italian dressing mix and only used half the jar of pepperoncini peppers.  It turned out very good, and my husband who likes milder foods will love it while I would prefer it just a little more spicy.  Next time I will follow the ingredients more closely to the recipe.  Either way it's an excellent recipe - just depends on what you prefer.

my husband really liked this. Best roast I ever made he said. I didn't shred the beef to go in a sandwich, I kept it as a roast with potatoes around it. It was tender and juicy with lots of flavor. Next time I make it I won't use quite as much pepper juice as I didn't know my own tastes for it. Great great recipe. Thanks!

Very, very good! My roast was about 2 pounds, so I used 1.5 packs of dressing mix and that seemed sufficient. I added the pepperoncinis at the beginning, juice and all (do be sure to remove the stems so you don't eat them later in your sandwich). Served on toasted hoagie rolls. Yum. Thanks :)

This was very good!!  I didn't use the pepperocini's because hubby didn't want them.  Used toasted hoagie rolls and provolone cheese.  It didn't taste like the Chicago italian beef I remember but it was still excellent!  Meat could be eaten as is for main dish.  Will definitely be making this again.

You must be careful, adding the pepperocini's and/or their juice really spices this up, like really.  I love it, but my family really won't eat it at that heat level.  To de-spice, stem the peppero's, remove the seeds and stem "meat" from the inside of the pepper and rinse well with water.  Drain and add during the last hour or so.  I add my own spices instead of prepackaged dressing mix, basil, oregano, fennel seed, thyme, juniper berry, peppercorn, bay leaf and whatever else strikes my fancy, couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce and brown the meat first.  Also I add carrots, celery and onions (browned) and half a dozen garlic heads, smashed but not browned.

I made this after reviewing several Italian Beef recipes.  Came out awesome!  Used 3lb Round Roast (cut off visible fat), 2 packages Italian Dressing mix, one can beef broth, one can french onion soup, 2 Tsp minced garlic and a 16oz can of sliced pepperoncini (juice only, added peppers halfway through.)  Put it in around 3pm and took it out at 5am before work, chopped it up and put back in juices.  It was perfect!  Spicy and yummy.

This was excellent!! I trimmed the fat off and used .7 ounce italian dry mix  per pound. Also reduced the water to half a cup. I added the pepperoncini's half way threw but if you like them crisper add them later. Put the meat on an onion bun with some pepper and mozzerella than put it in the oven for a few mins. Im def gonna be showing this one off to friends and family. Thanks for this recipe:)

This was very good. I was worried about the saltiness some other reviewers talked about but didn't find that to be the case. I only used 2 packets of seasoning but next time will do all 3. I used half a jar of the mild pepperoncinis along with half the juice and this gave just the right kick. The smell of this cooking drove me crazy all afternoon!. I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!! One of the problems I have w/ trying slow cooker recipes is that they never quite taste as good as they smell. They always need more spices, and I'm not the type of cook that can say, "Oh, it needs a little bit of this...". I need to find recipes that taste great as they are. This recipe was VERY tasty! I prepared it exactly like the recipe. It was salty and spicy, which my husband and I both really like. However, if you want a little less salt, maybe decrease the italian seasoning mix until it fits your taste. If you like it a little less spicy, decrease the peppers, the juice, or leave them out entirely. I thought it was great as is!! I will definitely make this again!

You are not going to know what hit you! This was by far the best sandwich we have EVER eaten! I used three lbs of chuck steak instead of the roast and it turned out so juicy and tender. I cut the fat off the steak before putting in the crock pot. Then I threw the fat in with the meat to give it some juiciness. I added the peppers halfway through. I baked the hamburger buns with mozarella cheese. This was remarkable and incredibly low maintenance too--thank you!

When you look at the list of ingredients in this recipe it is deceptive, who would imagine that such a short list of things would create such a wonderful flavor!  Really loved this.  I used two packages of italian dressing, and did half the jar of peppers about half way thru and the other half at the end, with all the juice.  Used better quality rolls and everyone loved it!

Excellent, very easy.  I am always looking for good crock pot recipes and this fit the bill.  We used a leaner cut of meat and trimmed to our liking and used extra pepperocinis!

Although my husband seemed to like this and he ate all of it.    I thought it smelled wonderful, but it just didn't look good to me.  The meat looked to soft and fatty.  I was hopeing the meat would be tougher, I HATE soft meat.  My husband might have liked it but I'm never making it again.

Great flavor! Used 1/2 the peppers and 1/2 the juice as the wife can't eat it real spicy. Easy and delicious. Freezes well for leftovers that seem to be better than the original. On Dutch crunch w/ provolone.

My family absolutely loved this dinner! I doubled the recipe in order to feed everyone. I wasn't sure how it would come out, since I took some of the others advice and lessened the italian dressing mix and I also put half the pepperocinis and juice in with the roast while cooking on low for 7 hours. Then I put the rest of the peppers in during the last 20 minutes or so. Some of us ate it on italian rolls with provolone while some of us just ate the meat and veggies. Our 6 kids (ages 1 to 8) loved it and some wanted seconds (not common in this house)! My husband and sister-in-laws thought it was great as well! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks so much!!

Wow! I only used one packet of salad dressing and put a few pepperoncinis and juice in the crockpot while the roast was cooking. Also, we used toasted english muffins. Yummy! I highly recommend this recipe!

It was wonderful! In fact so much so that my husband and I ate it for three nights in a row and didn't mind at all. I used ciabatta bread as I am not crazy about plain buns.

Made this the other night as we were craving Chicago Italian beef. It turned out really well. Reading other reviews I did make adjustments. I put 2 packets of Italian seasoning and put the peppers and juice all in the beginning. I did add a little bit of oregano and garlic powder. My husband loved it and said this is as close as it can get to the Chicago Italian beef. Making it again today :)Thank you!

I made as directed. When meat was done, put it on hoagie buns with provolone cheese. Broiled it until brown. I also made au jus to dip it in since we like it sloppy. The recipe was sweeter than anticipated, so will add some heat the next time we make it. Overall very good!

I made it exactly by the recipe and it was perfect. This is one of those recipes that needs no changes. This is one of those recipes if you know how to cook and do have to/or want to change will still be perfect. Thanks.  Great recipe.

I use two packets of dressing mix. I add in a jar of whole pepperocini in the last hour. I usually add about half of the liquid in the jar. I use a cup of vegetable stock instead of the water. This is a huge favorite in our house. We have it at least once a month.

Love this! I followed some of the tips in the comments & I agree, I use 1.5 packages of Italian seasoning, omit the water & add the peppers w/juice at the beginning. Use beef broth in lieu of water & use 1/2 the amount. Delicious!!

I am definitely keeping this one! I followed some suggestions from other reviewers. I used a can of beef broth instead of the water and I used two seasoning packets. It was delicious! The next day I used the leftover beef to make beef and cheese enchiladas and those were delicious as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this using some of the suggestions of others. I used 3 lbs of arm roast, trimmed of the excess fat. I only used one pack (1.2 oz) of Italian dressing mix and two cups of beef broth. I added two cloves of garlic and a quartered sweet onion while the beef cooked. I drained the peppers and added them the last two hours of cooking. This was delicious! I never would have attempted making Italian beef if I hadn't found this recipe.

I tried this last week and it was a big hit! I followed the recipe with one slight change. I substituted the 1 cup of water for Beef broth. Spices were perfect. With just the 2 of us, I had some to freeze. My husband is already asking for it again! This is a winner!

I used the full amount of Italian salad dressing, and it was perfect for us. Slightly salty, but we like it that way. I also used half of the pepper juice. I added it about halfway through. YUM! Super easy to make as well. Thanks!

Like other reviewers, I made a variation of this recipe which my whole family enjoyed: I used two packets of Wish Bone Italian Dressing mix, three beef bouillon cubes, and approx a tsp give or take of oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  Brought the water and seasonings to a boil and dissolved bouillon, then poured over meat in crock pot.  I set my device to high and after three hours, I cut the meat into approx 1-2 inch slices and submerged them in the liquid at the bottom of the crockpot.  After another six hours or so on low, I shredded the beef and returned it to the pot.  I set aside enough to feed my younger children, and then added one jar of pepperoncini's, including the liquid, to the meat in the crock pot.  The mixture was left uncovered on low heat until served, about 45 minutes.  I buttered and toasted hoagie rolls under the broiler.  I put the meat on the rolls and topped it with provolone, then slid them back under the broiler to melt the cheese.  Served these gems along with steamed beans and a cucumber salad.  A new recipe to add to the rotation, everyone loved this meal and it was super easy to make.

Best thing by far I have made from this site so far. I was pretty skeptical, but it had almost the exact taste and texture of my favorite Italian beef from back home. I had a slightly smaller piece of meat than the recipe called for, so I reduced the amount of Italian dressing mix and I used half a jar of the peppers and juice, instead of a whole one. I also cooked it on low for about 10 hours, instead of high, just because I think meat comes out more tender that way. Agree with those who have said it's a waste to serve on a hamburger bun. Get yourself a good crusty roll of some kind. I topped mine with some sharp provolone and stuck it in the oven to crisp up the bread and melt the cheese. Fantastic.

Absolutely delicious!! I put the peppers in at the beginning though. My opinion it tenderizes the meat more.

I love how easy this recipe is and its delicious. The only thing I do different is instead of water I use beef broth. (I hardly ever use water with any recipe.) My son is the pickest eater and he loves it. Thank you so much for sharing.

Bad instructions. 

5-6 hours on high made the meat very tough and impossible to pull apart with a fork.  I will try again using the low setting for 9 hours as other Italian Beef recipes suggest.

This was a hit with the whole family, even my five year old. I only used two 0.7 oz packs of the dry Italian dressing mix instead of the 3 1oz packs it called for and I cooked it on low all day instead of high.

I really liked this one.  I asked my husband what he thought and he liked it but thinks it needs a few tweeks.  He loves the French dip so he wants me to try this recipe with beer instead.  I think I will reduce the number of Italian dressing mix packages to 2 as well. I also Salted, peppered and used some Garlic powder on the meat before I put it in the slow cooker.

Easy and delicious. I use half a jar of pepperoncinis and about 3 TBS of the juice at the beginning (so it is not too spicy for the kid), and only 2 packets of dressing. We like it juicy so I also add about 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar. It is perfect.

Amazing! I made this for a party and it was gone before I could blink. What a hit! I added 1 cup of beef broth and a 1/2 stick of butter to make it more like a Mississippi Roast. You could use a packet of aus jus instead, but I prefer the broth. I also used a larger jar of pepperoncini as well. This is a keeper!!!

This was ok, I only used one package of Italian dressing mix and a cup of bruschetta Italian dressing in place of water.  Next time I will make exactly as the recipe states.

Wonderful and so easy.  We have used this recipe about 4 times, and it never fails. Only modifications are we use 1 pkg. dry Italian dressing and 1 pkg. dry Zesty Italian, and we cook our 3# roast on high for 2 hours and low for 3-4 hours (my crock pot is 6 quart and cooks faster than some others).  We particularly like this open faced on French bread. So good! Thank you for the recipe Randi!

The family LOVED this...including three small-ish kids!  I only used the 2 packets of seasoning and just used about 1/3 jar of the pepperoncini juice (only).  I sauteed onion, red peppers and green peppers to serve on top.  Being a vegetarian, I was the only one not to enjoy it!!

We made this recipe on a busy Saturday.  It was super simple to put together, and there is no comparison for crock-pot-house-smell.  When it was time to eat, we were blown away by the taste.  This recipe has earned a spot in our monthly rotation for sure.

Changes:  Cooked for 7.5 hours on low, high for 30 minutes after shredding and adding peppers.

Made this on Saturday and ate then then kept leftovers until Monday reheated and it was even better. Everyone wanted to know my secret but I wil never tell them. Very easy prep and cooking time was spot on. I served it with a special sauce I make with Horseradish,Mayo,Dejon Mustard,and Sour cream. What a treat on a Home made bun with Sweet Potato Fries

SOOO good. I add a couple cloves of minced garlic and about an hour before we eat, I throw in some sliced onion. Serve it on a nice crusty roll, toasted with butter and garlic...this is a staple at our house.

Very easy, delicious with or without the pepperoncini.  The meat just falls apart and is delicious!  Sometimes I’ll add minced giardiniera for flavor too.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

Easy and good. I added some pickled banana peppers to the last hr and I think that help it a little. Drain off the liquid and pour it through a strainer and then separate the fat off the top. Then you can dip this unto your bun. Man that's a meal my family loved.

My boyfriend and I loved this when I made it the first time.  The only thing I did was use 2 packets of Italian dressing and I added only about 5 or 6 peppers and a little juice and it was perfect.  The only thing that wasn't, was there wasn't enough left over!  I got it cooking now, with 2 roasts this time.  :-)

This is delicious! I used 3 packets of dressing but only 1/2 a jar of peppers. It still had a kick and was almost too spicy for the little ones but everyone ate every bite.

Easy - delicious recipe- I used a 2 pound london broil -just because it was on sale- I didn't have Italian salad dressing so used Italian herb seasoning and followed the rest of the recipe - it came out just great - I'll try with the Italian salad dressing and see if it is better - can't see how but maybe.  Thanks much for this recipe

I saw these sandwiches featured on a Food Network show.  I have never eaten this before, but thought they looked delicious on TV.  I came across this recipe and read reviews etc and thought I would try it.  This meat was delicous and we absolutely loved it!!!!!    I had to make some changes since I decided to make it last minute, and will follow the recipe more closely next time, but it was still excellent.  I only had 1pk of dry italian dressing so I added bottled italian dressing from the fridge (about a cup) instead of the water.  I also added the pepperoncini's and juice 1/2 at the beginning and the other 1/2 at 4hrs in.  Cooked for 4hrs on high and then turned to low for about 4 hrs.  Toasted some delicious rolls under the broiler for about a minute, then piled some of the shredded beef and a thick slice of provolone cheese, back under the broiler for a min and serve with a salad.  My hubs went nuts over it!  I know he will be asking for this one again really soon!

EASY easy easy!!!!! I put it all in at once and cooked on LOW 10 hrs. Refrigerated over night and removed fat from top of pot and meat and shredded the next day. Then back in the pot on warm so it was ready for Super-bowl guests. What a hit.

I thought this was an excellent way to do a roast a bit different from the norm.  Good flavor and awesome if you're a fan of wet sandwiches.  Used 2 packets instead of 3 and thought it was just the right amount of flavor.  Thanks!

Tried this after not being thrilled with another recipe for italian beef on here. My husband is a huge fan of Portillo's italian beef in Chicago so I'm always trying to recreate it for him. This came the closest so far. As reviewers suggested, I did use a can of beer instead of the water, and cut back a bit on the salad dressing mix (if memory serves..I made this a few weeks ago). Anyway, it was outstanding, thanks for a great recipe... a true crowd pleaser.

Have tried multiple versions of Italian beef from the site and this is the best. Used the Italian Salad Dressing mix from the site as it allowed me to control the salt. Also used 1 bottle of beer as was suggested by others.

The flavor seems good, but the cooking time is just too long.  The Italian beef we are accustomed to is very thinly sliced.  I would reduce cooking time, allow to cool and then slice.  After sliced place the meat back in the juice and let it keep cooking.  As written this is more along the line of a pulled pork consistency.

Very good.  I made this w/1 pkg of zesty italian seasoning and only half the jar and juice of the pepperoncinis.  I also used a chuck roast that was 2.66lbs.  I used beef broth but I think I will try it with beer next time!

I added 1/2 cup of vinegar and two beef bouillon cubes DELIGHTFUL!  The BEST Italian beef I've ever had.  (And I'm Italian!) I made it for our "Lost" night and it disappeared in about 3.5 seconds flat. This is definitely a new favorite.

This recipe is so DELICIOUS! I didn't change the process at all, but I did split kaiser rolls brush them with evoo and garlic, then broil them. I topped the rolls with beef and added a slice of provolone and broiled again for a min. or so. This is my new favorite meal!!

This meal is so easy and delicious, I've already shared it with a number of friends. It's perfect for a working person to throw together in the morning. When you come home, just a few moments shredding with the fork, toasting up some hoagie rolls, and you're ready to go. The leftovers are fantastic as well.

Loved it!  And hey I don't even have a slow cooker...I had a 1.5 lb. chuck roast, rubbed it down with the Italian seasoning first, placed on a rack in a roasting pan, in the oven 300 degrees for about 2.5 hours...tightly covered with heavy duty foil...it was a pretty fatty piece of beef, so the rack helped "drain" some of the fat.  Like others, I just dumped the whole jar of peppers and juice, along with some beef broth into the pan at the start.  Served on french hamburger rolls with some of the peppers chopped up...we were in heaven!  How Pittsburgh-y is this!

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used only 2 .7oz packets of Italian dressing mix.  I also used a slightly larger roast (3.5 lbs) and used more than the recommended amount of water by 2-3x.  Unfortunately, it was still incredibly salty--maybe it was the brand I used?  That's not to say it wasn't extremely tasty, though!  Will definitely be making this again, but with further adjustments.  Will probably use just one (or one and a half) packet of Italian mix and more water to give ourselves more juice to dip in.  Also, I used only half a jar of pepperoncinis,  because I wasn't sure how spicy it'd be and I have a toddler to feed.  She isn't a beef eater, and this she actually ate most of!  Turns out the brand I used wasn't too spicy, so I'll probably use the whole jar next time since having more peppers in there might've been nice.  Even if this is or isn't close to authentic italian beef (I wouldn't know) it's still good!

So easy!!  Very good.  I didn't as much of the italian dressing packets as it called for just because I didn't buy enough at the store; I definitely will next time.  Love the peppers at the end and will add some of the juice next time (not knowing if I wanted it or not this time).  Wouldn't change a thing.

My husband and son loved it. I added a whole jar of the peppers with the juice and it was too much for my taste. I would go half next time.  It's the consistency of pulled pork (shredded) vs. the traditional italian beef (sliced).

I was very skeptical when I saw this recipe but after looking at the other reviews I decided to try it. I followed the recipe, with a small change, using beef broth instead of water and a 4 lb.  roast instead of 3 lbs. It was outstanding! Everyone raved about it but the best part was the simplicity. Thank you for a great recipe that will now be in regular rotation at our house.

Awesomely easy! I can't wait to make my sandwich when this is ready, so I just shred enough for my meal (on a toasted roll, with melted provolone or mozzarella).  When I'm done, the rest of it has cooled off enough to handle easily.  I drain the meat pretty thoroughly, and reserve the liquid in the fridge for my sandwiches (after I pick off the cooled fat) and then use the extra next time I make the recipe.  This is also FABULOUS with pork tenderloin.

I made this recipe just as stated, only I had a larger cut of chuck roast.  I used 3 packets of the dressing and I added a whole jar, juice and all, of the peppers.  I added just a little water,and cooked it all day on low. It tasted great, not too salty.  The peppers just smashed into the meat easily.   I wouldn't recommend using the juice because it was very greasy, but maybe if you chilled it and scraped off the fat, it might be better.  It is easy, not too spicy, and both my kids don't complain when I make it.

This is a regular in our house -- you can easily tweak the spiciness to suit your own tastes.  The leftovers freeze well, too!

I cooked the meet in about half the jar of pepperoncini and this came out absolutely delicious. I served on this site's "Soft Onion Sandwich Rolls" and it was a feast. One thing I like to do is cool the crockpot in the fridge with the meat in it so the fat hardens on the top and it's easy to take off. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

This was very tasty.  I took the advice of putting on some provelone and melting under the broiler.  Delicious!

I used two packets of Italian dressing, as many others suggested.   It was not too salty at all. I added the peppers and juice halfway through, which was also a suggestion.  If you like it with a little kick, I would suggest that you do the same.  If you want a more subtle spice, then add it near the end. My husband loved the recipe. We will definitely do it again! A serving suggestion...toast the buns with a slice of provalone cheese  before toping with beef.  Yum!

Made a few changes - add the peppers from the beginning, use french or cuban bread (the hamburger bun just doesn't do it.)  Also, toast the bread a few minutes in the oven and then broil some provolone on top, don't forget to pour the juice on! - The recipe is then RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS!!!

Definately season this to taste.  I used one packet first and when it was done, I added some more until it was just right.  But, I do love this recipe.

I didn't think this was going to taste as good as a BBQ flavor, but I was impressed with the taste!!  Easy to make! I won't give up the BBQ, but I welcome this change for the family!

Fantastic!  I did make some changes though.  I used one packet of Italian dressing, 2 cups beef broth, and 1 cup zesty Italian dressing from Kraft.  I also added in some minced garlic and oregano.  These were wonderful!  I served it on toasted french bread with some of the broth on the side for dipping.  We will certainly have this again!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I used  beer and reduced sodium broth instead of water.  I too would suggest using just 1 packet of seasoning.  It would be way too salty with 3.  I added onions as well. Served on ciabatta bread with meunster or mozzarella cheese.  Delicious.

This was a bit salty. I only added 2 pkgs of the italian seasoning and did not add the pepperocini. In place of the pepperocini I put in red pepper flakes and green peppers. Maybe that's why we thought it was just ok?

Good recipe. Not exactly like the famous Chicago Italian Beef, but good nonetheless.  If the peppers are too spicy for your family, just add big chunks of green or red bell peppers the last hour or so of cooking instead.  More authentic, anyway.

I printed this recipe for the ease of preparation, and it lived up to my expectations in that department, and exceeded my husbands expectations in taste.  I usually have to probe my husband for his opinion on the food that I cook...with this roast, he told me over and over that he has a new favorite and that it was the best roast he has ever had!!!  We are not big on eating our leftovers, but he made sure that our poor dog didn't get any of this one.  I did not work hard to try and shred this, as I planned to serve it as a roast, but I don't think my roast would have shreaded too easily...nonetheless, the flavor was incredible.

This is how my mom makes her italian beef. It's killer good. She uses onion soup mix sometimes instead of the italian. Try that instead if you need to sub.

Ok, this was tasty, and easy, and we really liked it. BUT... and this is a biggie...does NOT taste like Italian beef, maybe a 5 out of 10 on the Italian beef scale. Tasty... but i'll keep searching. I've consulted my husbands mom (she lives chicago area) and i'm going to experiment with her recipe... maybe i will post if i can get it right!!!

Served at a Super Bowl Party and twice since.  Oh so easy and Oh so good!!!  Had several requests for the recipe and they wouldn't belive me in how easy it really was.  This recipe was just as good if not better than my previous recipe given to me by a good friend and it was half the effort and ingredients.

Amazing! A kicked up roast! I made this in my pressure cooker, added the pepperoncini early.  What great flavor!  Served on a kaiser roll with lots of peppers and a slice of mozzarella or provolone.

My recipe for Italian beef is just the same.  The only difference is that I put 1/2 of the peppers in while the beef is cooking.  It has been a hit with many different people, usually make this one when a group is coming for a get together.  Cooking the peppers with it adds a little extra zip.

So flipping good! This is always a crowd-pleaser! I only use 1 packet of the dry Italian season, most of the entire jar and juice of the peppers. Let it go for 7 hrs in crock pot and it falls apart. We serve it on gently toasted rolls under the broiler and put a slice of American cheese and one of provolone put it back under the broiler for a few minutes and then serve it with a little mayo and the rest of the pepperoncini peppers. It makes delicious and cheese. This is great idea for parties or even when you are out all day at a sport tournament!

This is really easy and came out really good! I followed others' suggestions by paring back the Italian seasoning - I used 1 , .6 oz. packet on a 3 lb. roast.  I quartered two onions, placed them on the bottom of the pot, then added the roast, sprinkled the seasoning, added three cloves of smashed garlic,  8 oz. beer, 1/4 C red wine, and about 12-14 oz. of beef broth. Cooked on high for 6 hours, it shredded in the crock pot super easily, then cooked for another hour.  Toasted the buns, served with provolone and au jus. It was delic! Thank you Randi!

Fantastic!  I used 2 packs of Italian dressing (mostly because the meat I had was only 2.2 lbs) and a full jar of sliced pepperoncini's.  Amazing!  Best beef sandwich I've ever had!  (Yes, I buttered the buns, put garlic salt on them and put them in oven.)  
I served with French Fries and beans.  Just out of this world.

This was really good but I won’t use any water next time. And I added minced garlic and only 2 packets of Italian Dressing.

This was absolutely amazing - so flavorful, juicy, tangy, with a nice mildy sweet finish.  It was ridiculously easy too. We actually cooked it for 8 or 9 hours due to our schedule & it was still juicy as can be. My husband put some on a hoagie bun with a slice of provolone & then lightly toasted in the toaster oven.  I just ate it plain & enjoyed it immenseley (& I am not a big meat eater).  We are probably going to make this again before the week is over!

Very flavorful sandwich.  I used only 2 pkg Italian seasoning - did not affect how meat cooks, just a personal taste preference as is the addition of the pepper juice. 
Toasted buns and provolone was nice addition as well.

I have been making this on Christmas Eve for huge family gathering for serveral years. I don't change a thing. Serve with some Italian Giardinieara. Of course, I provide French Rolls, but have recently learned that some people like their Italian Beef on Hawaiian rolls (not traditional, but if you like it, why not?!!!?) Anyway, this is a GREAT dish to serve a large group (what I lovingly call "feeding the masses."

One of my go to favorites!!!  Minor adjustment is to use 2 packets Italian dressing mix and we only use 1/2 a jar of peppers.   Great on a plate for “low-carbers”, but use soft sub buns for delicious sandwiches.  We like provolone cheese, but pepper jack is nice too.  Simple and foolproof.  There’s something about the dressing mix that tenderizes the meat. Guarantee your family will enjoy.

Delicious and easy! I made a little over three pounds, and based on others’ suggestions, used two packets of Italian seasoning, a can of beef broth instead of water, and threw in the whole jar of pepperoncini from the start. Cooked on high for six hours, shredded the beef and cooked another half hour or so. Also, use good French rolls and toast them. Buy the hot and sweet peppers and use the juice to dunk your sandwich. Yum!! 

 We had no leftovers! It was delicious, tender and flavorful and authentic.

I can't speak to the authenticity, but it's a win! Didn't have Italian dressing seasoning, so I used this recipe: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25171/italian-dressing-mix/
Also used ATK potato bun recipe so everything was from scratch. Finally, I made this in my instant pot on high pressure for 60 min with a natural release. Will make again!!

My family loves this.  Very easy to make and really good.  I prefer it with the Italian dressing mix and a pack of Au jus gravy mix but I have also made it exactly as the recipe states and its great as well,  and it is  a really nice alternative for a roast. Its such a favorite with my teens that I have made this at least once every few months for a couple of years now. 5 ++++++ stars.

This recipe came out really well for me. I didn't find a 3 lb. roast so I used one that was slightly over 2 1/2 lbs. which worked out just fine for me. There was plenty of meat in this. I also used 2 packets of the Italian dressing mix instead of the 3 called for just because I felt it would be too much. I did not miss the third packet at all. I think two is definitely enough since I do not like my food too salty. I used a jar of sliced pepperoncinis because that's what I happened to have on hand. This came out really great tasting. I left all the juices in with the meat after shredding it because I didn't want it to be too dry. I would definitely make this again.

Extremely yummy!  I used nearly 6lbs of beef and kept the original amount of dressing mix.  We made Philly cheesesteaks out of some of the meat.  For this we pulled out the roasts and let them rest/drain on a baking rack over a cookie sheet.  Once completely cooled we shredded and put half the beef with about 1/2 jar of pepperoncini's and pepperoncini juice in a slow cooker.  We removed most of the original liquid from the original slow cooker, then added the other half of the meat and the rest of the pepperocinis.  Everyone was able to make the sandwiches they desired from that point on.  I was one of the Philly Cheesesteak folks as I don't like the way Italian Beef sandwichs can be really soggy.  We also used bolillo rolls in place of hamburger rolls.

We will be making this again.  It was fabulous!

If I could give this recipe a 10 star review I would. This is DELICIOUS. I read heaps of reviews and these are the changes I made:
I only used 45 grams of Italian dressing mix otherwise it would have been too salty. I made my own dressing mix using a recipe I found in this website. I used beer instead of water. I used half pepperoncinis jar and a little bit of the liquid and put them right at the beginning.  
It was absolutely incredible. Making this again next week :)

It was really good and simple. Two of my favorite things. I did change one thing, I happened to have a London Broil and used that instead of the Chuck Roast. Recipe is worth trying people.

Took advice and used 1 package of Italian seasoning mix, ! T. Oregano, 3/4 T. Basil and a 1 tsp of garlic powder. Also used 1 bottle of beer instead of water. Cooked the peppers with the roast for 8 hours on low.  Used 4 lbs of arm roast.

I made it as written, and it was too salty for me. But it gave me the idea. So next time, I just used minced garlic, a jar of pepperoncini peppers, and a couple tablespoons of italian seasoning instead of the salad dressing mix. It was cheaper and tasted good without being too salty. I didn't add any salt at all, just the salt in the pepperoncinis.  now this is a regular in our rotation, and it's also good with chicken breasts by the way!

I thirded the whole recipe. I'm a single guy after the first big cook it is an easy late night snack to whip up.
This turned out real tasty that I had to eat it 2 days in a row. First day I just added Mozzarella. But the second day I added Mozzarella and Mayo and it was much better with the mayo. Also I sliced the pepperoncini so the flavor was throughout the sandwich.

Love this and make it often when company comes from out of town since it can sit in the crock pot while we are waiting on them to arrive. After reading all of the reviews and making it several times my favorite method is to rub the chuck roast with 2 pkgs of the Italian seasoning, cover with one cup of beef broth, add the pepperoncini and the juices and cook on low for 8 hours. Shred the beef and stir back into the juices in the crock pot. Serve on toasted hoagie rolls with provolone cheese.

This recipe is amazingly easy and delicious! As others mentioned, I did reduce the Italian dressing packets to 2 and instead of water, added beef broth. For a cheaper alyernative and because I was feeding a crowd, I used 2 pork shoulder roasts, cooking them separately as they wouldn't fit into one crockpot and used the same ingredients. Absoluyely delish! Oh, I did add one sliced onion and 3 minced garlic. Everyone goes crazy fir this recipe. Thank you!

Just stupid tasty!! A new family favorite, for sure. My method was two packages of the Italian dressing mix rubbed on while putting it in the crock pot, half juice from a jar of mild banana pepper rings plus all the banana peppers themselves. After cooking, I removed the roast and shredded the meat, strained the juice and returned some to the crock pot but held some out for dipping. Took the cooked and drained peppers and mixed with the meat and juice back in the crock. Served on buttered and toasted hoagie style rolls and it was a mad raving hit with everyone!! WOW!! Good stuff. I’ve also made this with a pork tenderloin and it may be better than with beef, no joke.

First time making Italian Beef, and everyone raved at the flavor!  Followed the recipe for ingredients but opted to pull the beef after around 8 hrs on low and refrigerate to run through my meat slicer as real Italian Beef from Chicago generally comes sliced not pulled.  Returned Beef to crock pot and juices on warm until ready to serve on a baguette.  Will definitely keep this one!

Turned out great !!!  I’m glad for the reviews and tweaks people leave here. Taking it out and flaking it apart and putting it back in for 30 minutes made a world of difference.

OK...my husband is my biggest critic.  IMMEDIATELY he told me I have to continue making this! :)  He absolutely loved it.  My entire family did! I barely made any changes too.  As a ranch owner I have a huge freezer full of deer meat so I used deer stew meat instead of the chuck roast.  PERFECT! I poured the entire bottle of pepper and juice into the crock pot at the beginning and cooked it all with the meat.  The juice in that jar is almost a full cup so I just added about 1/4 a cup of water to it.  That's it!  Cooked on low all day until we got home from work and put it all on toasted buns with Provolone cheese and called it good.  SO GOOD!  :)

I normally hate it when a reviewer says it was amazing but I changed 17 things....unfortunately, I am that reviewer today, lol. We were having a snowstorm and I didn't want to go to the store. I stuck a frozen chuck roast in the pressure cooker with some beef broth and ran it for about 30 minutes to thaw and tenderize the meat. Then I put the meat and some broth in the slow cooker. I didn't have pepperoncinis, so I threw in a spoonful of minced garlic, a sliced onion, and a sliced bell pepper and the 3 packets of italian dressing seasoning. It was a huge hit - we all loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I cooked this according to directions....it was terrible! what a waste of beef! I don't understand why it had so many good reviews.  I am sure that real Italian beef from Chicago does not taste like this one...They would probably laugh at this recipe.

Its a good recipe when my daughter loved it!  Put the peppers on the side for less spicy and it was still great!  Can't wait to cook with the peppers next time!  Comes really close to sandwiches from Chicago.

Very easy and very delicious.  I used 1.5 lbs of cubed beef for stew.  As such, I used 1 packet of dry Italian seasoning, 1/2 jar of mild sandwich pepper rings (plus some juice) and Campbell's canned French onion soup (added some water too).  Let this cook on low in the crockpot from 10PM until 8AM.  I bought Kaiser rolls and toasted the rolls topped with beef mixture and provolone cheese until the cheese on top was browned.  Open-faced sandwich that was incredibly good!

Base on the previous reviews, I ended up using 2.5packages of the seasoning (0.7oz each) , 1 bottle of IPA, and whole jar of the pepper +only half jar of its  juice. Cooked on low for 8 hours.  Turned out perfect!

I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of using  Italian dressing in place of water because I bought only one dry mix (my mistake).  I used the pepperoncini for the first time and used garlic parmesan  bread.  It is awesome, this recipe is in my Top 10 list to make again.

We made it as listed, but didn't find it to have a lot of flavor.  I don't know that there is anything wrong with the recipe...more that our family's tastes may run a different way.  It's always good to try new things...thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe is delicious and everyone that I have served it to raves about it.  As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the packets of dry dressing mix to 2. I put the the peppers and most of the juice in at the beginning, placing them on the bottom of the slow cooker. It adds great flavor and cooks the heat out of them. You can shred them along with the beef, discarding the stem. It's also a great finish to melt cheese on these under the broiler.

I never had "real Italian Beef" so i don't know if this is like it should be. However it is really good. Followed the recipe as submitted except i only used 2 packages of seasoning  and 1/2 jar of peppers (sliced). It was something different to bring to a club meeting and it went over well. I agree with another poster that you need some sturdier buns than  hamburg buns.
This is a  keeper.

This recipe is outstanding! I had low expectations for it, I'll admit, but it was one of the best things I've made from this site in awhile. Absolutely delicious. 

I halved the recipe, cooked on low for 9 hours then added the pepperoncinis and let it go another hour. Served on soft hoagie rolls with provolone cheese. Can't wait to make this again.

This was out of this world.  My whole family was addicted to this beef.  So much so I didn't have much leftovers.  The only thing I changed was I only used 1 pack of the italian seasoning mix.  Based on personal experience and other reviewers I was worried about it being too salty.  To compensate I added about 3 tsp of minced garlic, 1 T of dried oregano, 1/2 T dried basil, 1 T dried minced onion.   Also I drained the juice from the jar of peppers (it was a 12 oz jar as that was all I could find)  into the crockpot at the beginning and added the peppers the last 2 hours.  I wanted to make sure peppers weren't to soft or overcooked. Definitely going into our rotation!

My family loved this!  I did take a few reviewers suggestions and only used only 1 packet of dry Italian salad dressing mix and substituted low sodium beef broth for the one cup of water.  I also added the jar of deli sliced pepperoncini and its liquid in the beginning of the cooking process so the flavors would saturate the meat.  (The recipe has a little kick to it so kids or people that don't care for 'spicy' foods may not care for it. )

I've been using all recipes for a couple years and never reviewed until this recipe. Made this for my work and it was a huge hit. Everyone raves and wanted to know how to make it. Stuck pretty much to the recipe except for adding a 1/2 tablespoon of red pepper flakes, 1 beer and 1 cup low sodium beef broth in place of water. Next time I'll add more water too, just to have more dipping sauce. Use good sturdy sub rolls that can stand up to the dipping and it's as good as Al's Beef in Chicago.

To make this a 5 STAR recipe, forget the cup of water, add half the number of Pepperocini's but ADD them at the beginning of the cooking process and add a couple of Tbsp of butter.  It's called a Mississippi Roast, but tastes like Italian Beef like Aunt Lou use to make.

Will definitely make again. Loved it, everyone else said they did, too (trusting they are being honest). I didn't trust 3 envelopes of dressing mix, so started with two for my 3# chuck roast, but after tasting halfway through, went ahead and put in the third pkg; it was not too salty.  Next making, I might drain the pepperoncinis and put the liquid right in, but save the peppers for later in process. We toasted the buns and slathered some horseradish on them because that's how we roll here.

Deeeeeeelicious...but...I did only use 1 pkg of Italian dressing,  used beef broth instead of water and half jar of peppers with some liquid.
I also recommend making it the day before so you can refrigerate and skim off fat before reheating for sandwiches. It always tastes better the next day anyway! thanks...be making this a lot for the football season.

Really good
Changes: used 3 lb chuck roast with 2 packets of Italian dressing
DO NOT ADD EXTRA WATER!  IT GETS TOO SOGGY!
The key is to lightly coat buns with olive oil and garlic powder and then broil for one minute.
After shredding the beef do not put it back in the pot!!!  Put it directly on the bun.  It will be dry, not soggy.  Then top with provolone and broil for approx 45 seconds.

I usually make this during the colder months and football season. Everyone loves it! The changes I made is instead of using water I use a light beer, I usually buy two packets but it only takes one to one and half packets of the dry salad dressing to run the meat with it. When putting into the slow cooker I first add the beer, half a jar of peppercini's then the meat. I let it go for six hours then I add half a jar of hot peppercini's and let it go for another hour to two hours depending on the tenderness of the meat. Once it's done I pull the meat apart with two forks and out it back in the slow cooker and mix it up and turn the slow cooker on low. I found through trial and error that either brioche buns and Kaiser rolls work the best. I like to use a garlic spread on the roll then meat then a slice of either provolone or add some mozzarella. Mmmhmmm it's the best!

I make this with a pork butt or shoulder roast and it is awesome - I have tried with the beef as well but we like the pork much better. I adjust the pepperincini according to the crowd I'm serving and it always turns out delicious.

Was great!  I added two cups water (total) for more liquid, and cooked up some mild Italian sausages and added that to the sandwich.  Went for hoagie rolls and do yourself a favor and either make some giardineira or buy some to add to the sandwich.  Chicago's finest, and I'm a fan of deep dish as well.

I was a little skeptical that this would turn out okay. I don't usually eat Italian beef or pepperoncinis. However, it turned out  to be delicious! I thought it might be too spicy for my kids but the spice level was perfect. I used Italian dressing from a bottle as I didn't have a dry packet and it still worked just fine.

Growing up in Chicago and Italian Beef sandwiches , this recipe is good but..................The one critical item that makes this sandwich GREAT is the Italian Crusty Bread, it makes a huge difference! And then you can make it wet Dip the whole sandwich in the Au jus for a sec. Turano bread is great and it can be found at Wal Mart.

This was amazing.  I used a little over 2 lb. beef chuck steak, slow-cooked it with the pepperoncinis and 1-1/2 Italian dressing packets and a cup of beer.  So easy and so so so good.  Served on Italian bread loaf with melted provolone.

I LOVE this recipe!  Quite frankly, it's delicious as written, but it is also a great base recipe to use as a starting point to make it your own.  I like to add onion, garlic, red wine, beef broth, 2 Italian seasoning packets, one jar of Pepperocinis all at the beginning. I cut off all the fat I can see before I cooking purely as personal preference and then cook it low and slow all day in the crock pot.

This was absolutely amazing. Very flavorful! Thank you for sharing the recipe. I also made slight changes to it.
1 12 fl oz bottle of Sam Adams octoberfest beer instead of water.
Half of the peperoncinis in a 16 fl oz jar, and poured all the juice into the pot. We like dipping juice! I also put it in in the very beginning.
My husband said it was the best Italian beef he's ever had :)

Absolutely delicious! I did only use 2 packets of dry dressing but only because I had a smaller piece of meat. I also added a little of the pepperoncini juice at the beginning of cooking along with a beef bullion cube. Turned out great! I can't wait to make it again.

Just made this last week for just H and I.  We like leftovers so I used a 4# rump roast and 4 c. of 'no sodium' beef broth, taking advice from other reviews that it can become too salty.  I then added 2 packages of the dry Italian Dressing mix and about 2 T of powdered garlic, 1 T more of oregano, and one of Basil,and about 2 tablespoons of the juice from the pepperocinnis.  Allowed it to cook in the crock for the allotted time, shredded the roast and put it back in the crock with the juice.  I then added 2 green peppers and let those cook for about 20 minutes. (more time and they may have been mush)  Served on French rolls made for Italian Beef and H said it was absolutely the best he's ever eaten.  Ugh!!  Now wants me to make this once a week!  As good as this was, I do agree with others that the next time I will skip the pepperocinni juice until the end or even just add the peppers on individual sandwiches.  Somehow it altered the taste somewhat to throw it in at the beginning, for it to cook for hours.  Other than that this was absolutely excellent!  Thanks for the great recipe

I "accidentally" made a very similar version of this. I only used 1 package of Italian seasoning, added a 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, enough water to cover the roast, and added the peoperoncini peppers at the beginning. The peppers did turn out very tender (stems were easy to remove) and had great flavor. In hindsight, I will most likely up the seasoning packets and apple cider vinegar (1 packet and 1/4 cup respectively) and add a jar of banana peppers. Regardless, was delicious!

We have made this recipe several times since first discovering it a couple months ago. We enjoy it so much that I'm planning on serving it for an engagement party this coming weekend.  On toasted french bread with provolone cheese it is absolutely delightful.

Perfect!!!! Made this for company and nothing but rave reviews.

I've not had Italian beef before, so I have no idea if this is authentic.  Nor do I care, because this recipe is delicious! Like others, I only used two packets of dressing, and I used a bottle of dark beer for the liquid in addition to a bouillon cube.  In my opinion, the star of the show is the peppers.  They complement the beef and the seasonings perfectly.  This one will go into heavy rotation at our house.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used almost 4 lb of a lean roast, 2 packages of good season Italian dressing mix.   I think that was perfect.   I used almost a 16 oz jar of peppers and juice (had to save some for those who wanted them fresh on sandwich since I take the cooked peppers out after cooking the beef before I serve it.)  I also use a sturdier bun.

This nis my go to Italian beef recipe. I throw a beef boullion cube in and some roasted garlic for my taste and I'll top the sandwich with some hors radish and roasted red peppers. Left overs (if there are any) make great Philly cheesestake sandwiches the next day.

I mixed the dry Italian dressing mix with the cup of water before adding it to the slow cooker.  My family and I thought this was delicious.  I even received a compliment that it was better than a famous chain restaurant's Italian beef sandwich!  I was also told this was my son's second favorite meal - second to pizza.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I'm really sorry, but this was extremely salty.   It smelled wonderful cooking.  But after we out it on our buns....couldn't even eat it.    Way way too salty.  Sorry won't make this again.

Easy awesome recipe! My husband is an executive chef, which means I do all the cooking at home, raved and raved about this recipe.  I used the 3 packs of dressing mix but my store doesn't sell the pepperonici peppers so I subbed with banana pepper rings (the hot ones) and put it all in together. Thanks for sharing, we will be having it again!

Used 2pkgs Italian dressing mix, Sam Adams beer instead of water and the entire jar of pepperoncinis 1/2 way through the cooking. Toasted the Italian hoagie rolls, added the shreded beef and slices of Provolone then put under the broiler until the cheese melted. Great, easy recipe and will definately make again! Thank you Randi for sharing!

I was skeptical how this would turn out, with the ingredients.  Following other suggestions, (like using the crockpot) I also used a beef bullion cube and beer for the liquid.  It was great and we'll be having it again.

Excellent idea to add Italian seasoning to this dish. However, I only used about 1 packet and that was plenty. I also drained my peppers when adding. This made popular and easy "football fare."

Easy to make. I use 1 1/2 cups water + 1 1/2 pkt's of dry Italian seasoning. I've made it several times, & that concentration of water/seasoning always had the best tasting turn-out in my opinion.

After the meat was done there seemed to be a lot of liquid left.  I did double the recipe.  So I poured that into a container and set it aside.  I then dumped the jar of peppers liquid and all into the bottom of the crock pot, covered them with the meat, and turned the heat back on low for another hour.  I'm glad I set the broth aside, as when I used some the next day to reheat the leftovers it was more like gravy, which wasn't what I was after.  Great recipe.

Easy and wonderful recipe.  Used the other reviewers tip.  Used my kitchen aid to shred the beef.  Quick and easy.  Used bottle of dark beer instead of water.  Will definately make again.

Amazing dish.  I added a second jar of peppers the second time I made it because I love the zing they give the beef.  I added the peppers in at the beginning though and let them cook all day long with the beef. I I shredded the beef at the end then served with crusty hoagie rolls and a bowl of the juice as au jus.  Not too spicy, even for the kids.

What a great recipe...  Like some suggested I used two packets per every three pounds of meat and it came out perfect.  So perfect not a bit was left.

I make this very similar but I put a jar of Mild Gardiniera instead of the Pepperoncini peppers at the very beginning. (I live in Chgo and don't know if this is available in other parts of the country).  I also use beef broth instead of water and only 1 envelope of Italian dressing. I buy a loaf of French bread and cut into sandwich sizes.  For anyone who likes a lil spice on their foods, I put Hot Gardiniera on my sandwich.  Everyone who has eaten it loves it and I am constantly being asked when will I make it again. This couldn't be any easier.

i LOVE this recipe!!  I've made it several times, so at this point, I have started to make a few adjustments based on my own tastes.  I prefer sirloin roast, b/c I hate beef fat.  It's usually lean enough, but I trim it if necessary.  Instead of water, I use beef broth and red wine.  I also add a couple of garlic cloves and a sliced onion to the liquid.  I also apread some of the Italian seasoning into the meat before I put it in the crock pot.  When it's cooked through, I pull it out and shred it with forks, then put it back in the crock pot and pour in 1/2 of a jar of pepperocinis.  When I used a whole jar, the juice was too spicy for me, even though the meat still tasted fantastic.  I like the roast aus jus to keep the meat moist.  After about 30 mins of additional simmering, it's ready to serve.

Ok, I've been using allrecipes for several years and I'm too lazy to write reviews, however, this is truly amazing! I chose to use only 2 Italian seasoning packets and a whole jar of Peperincini (sp?) and I've made twice this week. It is amazing!

I have made this recipe twice in the last 2 weeks.  So good and so easy!  When I made it for the kids, I added just the pepperoncinis without the juice and the spiciness was just right.  I used less than half a jar.  Served on fresh bread with provolone cheese slices.  Delicious!

This was amazing!!!  Can't wait to make it again!  I cut down and only used 2 packages of the Italian dressing mix. I also added some garlic cloves at the beginning (can't have anything without garlic!). About a 1/4 cup of the pepperocini juice and just a few peppers about half-way through.

Great flavor overall. Goes well with kaiser rolls or bratwurst buns, dijon, and cheese. Next time I think we'll try a jar of hot pepporcini peppers instead, give it an extra kick.

We liked this. I used half the Italian dressing mix and replaced the water with juice from the pepperoncini and we thought that was not too salty. This really needs a crusty, not soft, bread, to do it justice. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was so good!  My mom said she likes the beef better than pulled pork.  I started mine the night before and let it go all the next day.  It was perfect.  The only change I made was I threw in a sliced onion and toasted some kaiser rolls.  I also served it with the option of adding sauteed onions, peppers, and mushrooms.  I will definitely make this again.

AMAZING! I made a few changes. I too used only 2 packetts of italian dressing. After I shredded the meat I added an onion and green pepper and let it cook on high for 30 more minutes. Toss the meat onto a sub roll and cover with swiss cheese!

This was very good. I followed the recipe almost exactly but finally got around to reading the comments while it was cooking. Since we are not "salty" people, I added a cup of beef broth. Also, I had to cut my meat by hand after 8 hrs. of cooking. I will be making this again, thank you for the recipe!

Very delicious.  I used a 5 pound bottom round roast, one full can of low-sodium beef broth in place of the 1 cup water, the 3 packets italian dressing mix, the jar of pepperoncinis.  I lightly misted steak rolls with olive oil and seasoned very lightly with garlic powder and celery salt (I also tried without, and much prefer it with the celery salt, trust me on this).  Sprinkled on some shredded provolone and mozzarella cheeses and toasted.  Served with some mild horseradish sauce.  Mmmm.  Leftovers were perhaps even better.  My family loves this!

Very good! Some people thought this recipe was too salty but I disagree. I used a 2.5 lb roast and only one evelope of italian dressing mix. I took someone else's suggestion and used buttered french bread and provolone cheese broiled first then placed the meat on top.  What an excellent sandwich!!!!

Awesome!  I'm a single guy and like to look for easy recipes.  I like some kick, so I added black pepper, ground red pepper, garlic, and oregano.  I put a a cup and 1/2 of water, so I could get a bit more juice.  The chuck steak came out perfect.  The stuff nukes up great for another few days as well.  The sandwiches are amazing!  Good recipe.  I will use this one again and again.

This is absolutely wonderful.  Lots of flavor.  I pour part of the pepperoccini juice out so that it is not so spicy hot but then I add the juice and peppers at the start.

This was a hit!  We had never tried anything like this before and we loved it!  My husband had to take the recipe to some co-workers of his so they could try it.  He had been talking about how good it was and they just had to see for themselves, and, well, it was a hit there too.  My mother-in-law even enjoyed it.  Now that's saying something.

Used only 2 packets of dressing mix and beer instead of water as suggested by some readers.  Not sure what I did wrong, but the meat was extremely salty.  Won't make this one again.  :-(

One of my hubbys favs of all time - spicy yummy!  Make sure you get a nice hardy roll to serve these on.  I wouldn't use hamburger buns, something more substantial is better.  I even take the left overs and make up sandwiches on buns and wrap them in foil.  So easy to take out and pop in oven for lunch or dinner.

My family loves this Italian beef.  I follow the recipe as originally posted and do not find the seasoning to be overwhelming, just the opposite - perfect.  I did find that using a store brand seasoning pack was not as good as using a name brand but I'm sure the store brands vary.  I just found the "generic" too salty and not as flavorful.  I add all the juice from the peppers and it is not spicy to us, in fact my toddlers eat it.  Then we just add the actual pepper to our sandwich for added heat.  We just love this, it's a new staple in our house.  Frugal ingredients and it makes enough for two dinners in our home.  Leftovers are even better!

Couldn't have been simpler and more tasty!  I would suggest, as I served this at a party, if serving on heavy bread, like a ciabatta roll, to either suggest to your guests (or do it for them), to dip the open face of their bread roll into the juice!  The juice and slices of provolone absolutely make this sandwich scrumptious!

Very good, I was looking for this recipe that I had made some years earlier, pumped up the peppers and the flavor was perfect.

This is AMAZING!!!I made it different because I didn't have the right peppers.  So, I used 1-7oz can of diced green peppers.  I also , per other reviewers, only used 2 of the dry Italian packets. Hubby raved and raved.  Making it again today :)   LOVE IT!!!

I loved this recipe.  One of the best things I've ever made in my crockpot. I used the whole jar of pepperoncini, a little beer instead of water, and I added a small onion, sliced.

Two Italian Dressing Packets or Three?  The great thing about this recipe is it is so adjustable and easy.  You just can't go wrong.  My personal taste is Two Italian Salad Dressing Packs and add the jar of Peppers in with the meat to start.  You really can't mess this one up.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this several times now and it's  a regular in our rotation.  I make it exactly as written. If you add the peppers they tend to overwhelm any leftovers eaten the next day.

We loved this recipe! I went with the reviews and only used two packets of italian dressing mix and I didn't feel it was salty at all. I also used a whole jar of mild pepper rings and about 3/4 of the juice (which I added in at the beginning with the meat) and a whole can of beer to replace the water called for. It had just the right amount of flavor and my family really enjoyed it. I will be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

This is AWESOME! I made it exactly how the recipe shows and it was a bit too salty however my boyfriend LOVED it. I made it again yesterday using suggestions from other reviewers and used only 2 packets of the Italian seasoning packets and it was PERFECT! My boyfriend also agrees that only 2 packets does the trick. This is a favorite for us! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a simple and amazing recipe. For those who like it a little more spicy, I just let the meat cook according to recipe, adding some jalapeno juice and pepperocini juices as well. Then once the meat was ready to shred, I shredded all of it up in a seperate bowl, without au jus, and added in some cumin, crushed red pepper, paprika, a half dozen drops of tabasco brand hot sauce, and about a half a dozen drops of a chile habanero hot sauce we had as well. After I poured in some of the au jus and mixed it all up. WOW. I unleashed on my guests and the look on their face was simply priceless. Best Italian beef they've ever had. So thank you for this recipe!

I had this at a shower a few weeks ago,my co-worker got the recipe from this site and it was FANTASTIC!!  So I made it for a get-together today and pretty much followed the exact recipe except I used two 2-1/2 lb chuck roasts and cooked them on low overnight (about 10 hours)due to a timing issue, when I got up in the morning, I added the pepperoncini and juice and cooked it for about another hour.  I reheated it to serve later in the afternoon.  Everyone LOVED IT!!  People had to have seconds (and thirds).  This was just different enough from most slow-cooker beef recipes to make it special and especially mouth watering; and the difference was so EASY.  I will absolutely make this again and again!

Great recipe and pretty similar to one of my friend's! I made the following changes:  I added only two packets of Italian dressing, added one can of beer, some Italian seasoning to taste, and added the actual banana pepper juice at the beginning of cooking so that the flavor cooks into the meat.  I added the peppers and shredded the meat during the last hour.  Also, I found they taste best when served on Hoagie buns and with some pepper jack cheese.  Delicious!  My husband loves these!

I cooked this recipe and my family loved it.  They want to know when I will make it again.  Instead of using the mix in recipe I used and crookpot Italian seasoning.  and 1 hour before turning it off I sliced green peppers and add to juices, it tasted like the real thing.  thanks for getting me started

Meh, this was not bad, but not for me.  I thought the italian dressing packets gave it an odd taste, and yes, it was very salty.  My husband liked it, but I don't think I will make it again.

This eas great.  I used three packets that were .6 ounces each.  It could have used the full amount.  Next time I will use 3 ounces.  I dont like spicy foods, but I have to say that this would not get the five stars if the peppers were not used on the sandwich.  This would also be good with banana peppers.  I did not put the peppers in the crock pot like some others.  Just follow the recipe and it will turn out great!

This was absolutely delicious! I was very hesitant to use so much Italian seasoning (it came in 0.6 oz. pkgs at the grocery store so I had to add 5 to get 3 ozs), but I am so glad I did! The meat was so tender and delicious! I added my pepperoncini an hour before it was done cooking with its juice. The beef was pretty spicy, and I couldn't give it to my 2 year old, but the husband loved it. I would make this again but I wouldn't add the pepper juice!

Amazing! I have never made Italian beef before, but I have eaten plenty of it. This was by far the best I have had. I followed the recipe, only I used 2 packs of seasoning instead of three. It was perfect and tender. A big hit!

This was FANTASTIC! I added a small amount of meat tenderizer (which I always do when cooking with tougher cuts of meat). I also added the jar of peppers(and all their juice) at the beginning. Served this at my 4th of July party and EVERYONE raved about it. Couldn't be any easier to make, too. A definite keeper.

One of our all time favorite recipes - everyone loves it!  We split hoagies, butter and broil them, then add the cooked italian beef followed by slices of provolone and quickly broil them again - DELICIOUS!

I made some additions to this.  I used a small can of beef broth in place of water.  I took the advice of some reviewers and used 2 packets of mix rather than 3.  In the end, I added some garlic, seasoned salt, onion, oregano and basil.  I used all of the peppers and about half of the juice.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used broth instead of water and it seemed to need a lot more then 1 Cup. I used 2 packages of dressing mix as suggested and the combination was pretty salty. Maybe next time I'll use low salt broth. The taste was delicious, the texture a little funky because I'm use to sliced beef. No one else complained about the saltiness, but I did have a couple complaints about the buns instead of italian bread.

This is a receipe my aunt in Chicago makes and I was so glad to find it here on the website. My husband LOVED this recipe! I bought sourdough rolls from the local bread store and it was fabulous! I only used 1 package of italian dressing and probably should have used at least 2, but it was still very flavorful.

Very Good!! Easy, just like I like. If you watch your salt, use one less pack of italian seasoning.

This was great! The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I made some changes to the recipe.  I only added 2 packages of italian dressing mix, then added 1 package of onion soup mix.  I also added the peppers at the beginning. It turned out absolutely perfect.

Very quick and easy, only used two season packets, but my husbnd and children love the taste. Took some of the juice and made a light gravy and placeed it on toasted bread for them and they ate it all up.

Wow, the best italian beef ever!  The only change I made was using beer instead of water.  I topped the sandwiches with provolne cheese and toasted them in the broiler.  They were so YUMMY!!

I made it with sliced roast beef from the deli and served it with onion rolls and provolone cheese.  A MAJOR hit with the men in my house...so tasty!

I've made this 1000 times since I first reviewed - with whatever roast is on sale.  I've even used venison.  Everyone loves it and many friends have put it in their regular dinner rotation.  

I now make it every year for my brother in law's March Madness poker tournament - he requested 15 pounds this year!

This was a delicious recipe, although even with slight recipe modifications, it was still a bit too salty. I used 2 packages of Italian dressing seasoning and Hot pepper rings. I added some of the pickled juice, which probably added too much salt! Worth trying again to "get it right"!!!

After trying this recipe, I came to the conclusion that I just do not like Italian Beef. I'm a huge fan of "Spiedies" - so I thought this would be a slow cooked take on that using beef. But, my family really didn't care for it. Found it to be too salty and not good enough to even try again with modifications. For beef, I think I'll just stick with barbecue briskets.

This is a keeper for sure.  Used beer instead of water, didn't cook the peppers (wanted the crunch) & served on french bread with the au jus for dipping.  They were great!

I made this and it turned out great. I added more water than the 1 cup it asks for, and I added diced tomatoes (from the can),  minced garlic and  2 beef bouillon  cubes. It was not salty at all.

My boyfriend asked me to bring him and his crew lunch this week.  I  made this recipe (with half the italian seasoning recommended...I was afraid it would be too salty) and it was amazing! This is an excellent recipe.  They all loved it!
I will definitely make this again.

Didn't care too much for this recipe. I think I just don't like the taste of the peppers. The meat shredded easly, but it wasn't for us. Hubby didn't like it either.

I am surprised something this easy could be so delicious.  My husband said it was the best roast beef sandwich he has ever had.  

I did as the other reviewers suggested and cooked the peppers and juice with the meat.  I only used about half the juice and it was wonderful.  The beef shredded easily after about 7 hours.

I've been making this recipe for a long time.  I use 1/2 of a can of beer instead of water.  It adds something a little different.  We like it on crusty rolls with provolone cheese and peppers.

These are REALLY good! Everyone went back for seconds and some even thirds! I used three (.7oz) packages of dressing and put half the peppers and juice in at the beginning and the rest an hour before they were done. I also served them on hoagie rolls which I think really *made* the sandwich! I will be using this recipe again and again!

This was so excellant!!  I can't wait to make it again!!  I would definately recommend good crusty rolls from your bakery as I feel they make a huge difference.  I added some of the pepperocini juice initally to add a little extra flavor (and more when I shredded it) and it was perfectly spicy.

I used three packets of seasoning like it said and it turned out incredibly salty. I will make again but probably with only 1 packet.
