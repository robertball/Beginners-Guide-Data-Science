Wow! This was delicious!  I was skeptical of using that many raspberries but definitely worth it.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  Tart and sweet taste that captured the fresh taste of the red raspberries!

I used Fat Free Half & Half, substituted the heavy whipping cream for Vanilla Almond Milk and did not put in the corn syrup for a low calorie Raspberry Ice cream... It is good! It's 166 calories for 1/2 cup :-)  Then I put my individual servings of 1/2 cut into the freezer so it's all ready to go when I need it.

I cut down the sugar to 1 1/8 cup and didn't include the corn syrup, and it ended up being wonderful for my mochi, it also had a beautiful color. I think that adding the amount of sugar and corn syrup called for in this recipe would make it way too sweet, but that's just my personal preference, I like my ice cream light, creamy, and refreshing.

I made a sizeable change because I wasn't comfortable with the raw eggs. I used my custard base of 1 c. half and half, 2 eggs, 1 c. sugar and 1/4 c. corn syrup brought to a simmer on low heat. I cooled it and added 1 c. of heavy cream, 1/2 c half and half, 1 tbsp. lemon juice and the raspberry puree. I used my Kitchen Aid attachment, then froze the ice cream for about 8 hours. It was a Valentine's Day surprise for my husband. I plan to make it for 2 more occasions in the next few weeks.

I doubled this and made it for a large party. I left out the corn syrup and it was awesome. A double batch filled up my old school ice cream maker.

This recipe was DELICIOUS. So smooth, creamy, and tasty. It remained scoopable after freezing, at least in my ice cream maker. I did substitute the corn syrup with 1/4 of sugar that I mixed with 1 tbsp of water and boiled, then simmered till the sugar completely dissolved.  I also did not have lemons on hand for the juice, but I just substituted crystallized lemon for it. The true lemon shaker that I have for teas, has a lemon juice substitute chart on it. I believe it called for 1/4 of a tsp for a tbsp of juice, but don't quote me on that. I just mixed it in right before I put the mix in the ice cream maker.

I'm giving this 5 stars based on what I did, not the original recipe because I didn't make the original. :)
My changes were to omit the corn syrup, and I heated the half and half before adding it to the egg and sugar mixture. 
This was AMAZING. I am planning on using this same base with assorted berries for ice cream in the future. 
Complete keeper!

I made this for Easter family dinner. I did not have fresh raspberries so I used frozen fruit of various kinds. Made to much for my machine so I made in two batches.It was so good and very easy. I will be making again all summer long.

Those who left out the corn syrup, professional ice cream makers use that small amount to prevent crystallization, ice cream stays smooth longer without the icy crystals. I use 4 yolks instead of whole eggs for creamy custard base and I temper the yolks using traditional cooked custard method. No need to use raw eggs when method can be adjusted easily. Add the puree and lemon juice when the custard cools. No other changes in ingredients. Two stars off for the unnecessary cooking shortcut eliminating tempering and cooking custard for safety.

I made this along with a bunch of other raspberry desserts for my Dad's 90th birthday and this is all he wanted to eat and take home with him!

This turned out amazing.  I made 3/4 of the recipe based on ingredients I had on band and The size of my ice cream maker.  It was the first recipe I made in it.  Couldn't be happier with results.

This turned out amazing.  I did have to make a few substitutions - I didn't have half and half, so I used 1 cup milk and 1 1/2 cups cream, and I didn't have light corn syrup so I used dark.  And I added a few drops of red food coloring.  Simply delicious, we'll be making this all summer.

This is EXCELLENT! We used fresh picked raspberries. This ice cream is tart, sweet, creamy, smooth and so delicious! It has the flavor punch of sorbet with the extraordinary creaminess of gelato. It is incredibly flavorful!
