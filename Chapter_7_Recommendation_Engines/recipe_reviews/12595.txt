the recipe title says it all!!! I made this because I had some peaches I HAD to use. I took it to a party and everyone wanted the recipe. I did sprinkel a little cinnamon on top for that little something extra! Great recipe!!!

Yummy!  I made this with canned peaches and it was a little too sweet.  I'll make it again, but if I use canned peaches, I will cut down on the sugar and I'll add a little cinnamon.

This is a great recipe!  I was skeptical about the bread as a topping but it turned out delicious and it is so easy!  This is definitely a keeper!

I tested this recipe out on my daughter and boyfriend yesterday and they really liked it (as did I).  Easy to make and yummy.  I made a few changes - I used a large can of sliced cling peaches in Lite syrup (drained) and used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also used honey wheat bread (it was all I had) and I topped the whole thing with a nice sprinkling of ground cinnamon.  I served warm (not hot) and topped it with whipped cream, which was good, but my boyfriend thought it would be great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This tasted like pure butter and sugar. I've come to learn that there is no substitution or shortcut for a good peach cobbler made from real dough.

i used canned peaches, and it still tasted amazing! BUT, 1 1/2 cups is WAY too much sugar!!!!! i love sweet desserts, and i only added 1/3 cup of sugar and it was still extremely sweet but it was the right amount of sugar if not too much

Wonderful! My family loves it.  I reduced the amount of sugar, but that is tempered by the sweetness of the peaches.  Try it!

We liked this a lot, but I halved the sugar, butter and flour -- used 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter and 1 TBSP flour. Even then it was still pretty sweet -- you could probably go with 1/2 cup sugar.

This was so simple yet tasty. I am a widow who likes to cook, but baking was no fun without someone else to appreciate my efforts.  Recipes like this give me some motivation to prepare a varied and better variety of food for my self.

Wanted to get in one more dish before the Georgia peaches are gone.  Followed the recipe to the letter except for reducing the sugar to 1 cup and I'll most likely reduce to 3/4 cup the next time.  I think the key to the cobbler topping is using a really flavorful, good quality bread.  I used Publix Bakery Homestyle Bread which is buttery, and IMO the best white bread available in this area.  I tried to do a little bit of a lattice weave with the bread strips on the top which helped its presentation.  The only time-consuming part of this recipe is peeling the peaches.  The peach filling was juicy, and the topping buttery and crisp. Thumbs up in this house, and definitely will make again.  One final comment...ain't NO way this 8x8 cobbler will feed 12.  In this house, it's more like 6 (or maybe even 4, YUM).

This was pretty good after remaking it. I took the suggestion of several others and cut way back on the sugar. I cut my bread into bite sized pieces and dipped them in a french toast type mixture of milk egg sugar and cinnimon. I layered it over the peaches and baked for the same amount of time. If you're using canned peaches make sure you only use about half the juice that comes with it.

I loved it! I thought the bread in it would make it not taste good but it makes it great! It's easy too. When you have the peaches and the bread in all you have to do is put in a mixture of sugar  an egg and some flour. when I ate it, It did not last long at all. some advice would be to double the ingredents and you will have 24 servings! I think everyone should give this recipe a try!

Quick & Easy! I used canned peaches and frozen mixed berries. Instead of white bread & flour, I used wheat and it still turned out yummy. I used a casserole dish and doubled the recipe but only used 3/4 cup of sugar, anymore would have been too much! Don't forget the vanilla icecream, this really completes this dish.

This was sooo good. I used cinnamon bread instead of white bread. Very simple and everyone loved it. I did not find this recipe to be too too sweet, but just right. Will make again!!

This is one of the easiest and best dessert recipes I have tried. My family loves it. We are watching our calories so I cut the sugar in half and used light bread and Light butter. It is still wonderful. I even tried apples and pears. So far the pear is winning followed by peach. Thanks for a great flexible dessert. I am bringing it to someone's house for a Christmas visit.

This recipe got decent reviews from the family, but no one was lining up for seconds.  This was good for a easy, quick dessert when you have extra peaches lying around and you're looking for some way too use them up before they go bad.  Just not as good as the real thing.

Very good & easy.  I only used 1/2 cup sugar and it was great!  Would have been even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I don't how an 8 x 8 pan can serve 12 people.

I LOVE this recipe.  It is the exact recipe and recipe title that I grew up with, from my grandma.  The only change I make, although my grandma made as the submitted recipe, is I don't cut off the crust.  I leave it on as I like the chewiness that the crust gives the topping.  This is my favorite recipe to use fresh peaches for a delightful summer dessert.  I have also made this using a peach/mango combination.  We like it best served slightly warmed with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This was de-lish! I used 4 very large peaches which were close to turning too bad to eat... and 1/2 cp of white & brown sugar each. I think when I make it again I will place bread on the bottom & the top. All 4 of us really enjoyed it!

Loved this, made a few changes based on other peach cobbler recipes.  I tossed the peaches (I actually used nectarines) with about a 1/4 cup of sugar with cinnamon and about a tablespoon of corn starch.  used about 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 cup melted butter and the egg.  tossed the bread in that mixture and layered it on top of the fruit.  followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out very well.

A friend/neighbor brought some fresh peaches over to her always-busy friend. (me)  Before I had a chance to "put them up", they almost went bad.  So, I got on the internet for a quick peach cobbler.  Lo and behold, I found this one!!  Excellent surprise!!  I never would have dreamed this would work, but even my "Yankee" husband who has a palate for exquisite tastes enjoyed it!!  WOW!!  I cut the sugar to 1 cup; had 10 small peaches and added an extra 2 slices of bread. (covering it w/bread)  I also added cinnamon on top and about 6 club crackers(crumbled) to butter/sugar mix.  Try it and enjoy this easy recipe!!

I did not think the white bread trick would work...But it did! I used white peaches and drizzled honey on top of everything before baking.It was delicious!

I thought this was delicious! I made it for my grandma and she raved as well. I added cinnamon on top and that added a nice scent/flavor to it. I've been reheating leftovers for a couple days and it's all very yummy still! Will def make this again! Also- I made it with peaches that were firm and not quite fully ripe yet, so I think the sweetness was perfect, but had they been really ripe peaches, I may have cut the sugar content.

I don't like to change the recipe the first time trying one however I didn't have real peaches so I used a 29 oz. can of peaches and I left the crust on the bread and cubed it, and one cup of sugar since using canned peaches with syrup.  I thought this was a great simple recipe. My 40 year old son & I  loved it.  Will definitely fix again for a quick yummy dessert.  Thanks for sharing!

I tweeked the cobbler I made a little, just so it would be enough for my family of 6. I also used canned peaches in syrup. I love peach cobbler. The only way it could have been better, is topped with vanilla ice cream.

I made some changes added a teaspoon of cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice. after reading some of the reviews I thought it was going to be to sweet. It turned out to be the perfect peach cobbler recipe of all times. It was really easy to make and Delicious. My husband took some to work and shared with his co workers they were asking him to tell me to send them the recipe. Wow I had fun making it. And I used Georgia peaches that I bought last weekend when we were visiting in Georgia.

The heck with cutting off crusts!  I made it with french bread, and the crunchy texture on top adds to the delight of peaches.  Also added fresh blackberries, and cinnamon.  Why made regular cobbler - this is amazing!

Just as billed - too easy!  Great recipe.  I hate when users change a recipe and then rate it, but....I was short on fresh peaches, so I added some canned, reduced the sugar by half and sprinkled the top with cinnamon.  Was yummy warm with ice cream on top!

Absolutely delicious!!  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the peaches and on top of the cobbler prior to baking.  I also added a touch of vanilla to the egg mixture.

This was so easy and delicious. I used canned peaches, cinnamon swirl bread,  added vanilla and cinnamon. I had to drain off the excess juices from the baked dish even though I strained the cans. Sure beats prepping fresh peaches. Will make again.

Pretty tasty.  I had peaches to use up, but was short on time and only had a few ingredients, so this using bread was a good thing. I did cut the sugar to 1 cup and probably could have went to 3/4 cup.  This was super easy to make and good if you're looking to make something quick without a lot of fuss.

This was delicious and simple. A great dessert choice for large groups as the peaches and bread can be prepped ahead of time and the butter mixture takes minutes to make and pour over. I modified my cobbler like many others by cutting the sugar down to 1/2 a cup and I also added roughly 3 TBSP milk to the mixture and 1 TBSP vanilla, as the mixture was far too thick to pour over. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a drizzle of honey when it came out of the oven. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again!

Lost my favorite cobbler recipe and found this and decided to try it. It was not only MARVELOUS but is even better than my old one. I did decrease sugar to 1 cup and a little less butter; because of the reviews from previous "users". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!

This was the first cobbler I ever attempted to make. Like many others have mentioned, it is way too sweet. I have made notes and will be playing around with this recipe until I get it right. Also, be sure to use more peaches if the ones you are using are small!

Cut out in pieces from pan to serve. Top with whipped cream or ice cream.

REALLY GOOD - but can't give it 5 stars because with the amount of sugar in recipe, it would be WAY too sweet.  I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and FRESH peaches, perfectly ripe (didn't peel them).  It was sublime.  Do NOT use canned peaches, but if that's all you have, then perhaps no sugar is the best solution.  The bread soaked up the egg mixture and got nice and custardy and crispy.  Sooooo delicious.

The filling was okay but neither my husband nor I really cared for the bread. It wasn't bad but I guess we just prefer a more traditional cobbler.

This recipe was great!  I doubled the recipe and followed some of the recommendations to cut back on the sugar, butter and flour.  I used 2/3 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup butter and 4 Tbsp of whole wheat flour instead of white. I sprinkled the top with cinnamon.  The result was delicious! This will be a repeat recipe for sure!  I was skeptical with the white bread, but it was great for not having the time to make old fashioned crust!

I will make this again, and again.  Delicious and super easy to prepare.  My changes were to add one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to the batter and I only used 3/4 cup of sugar as the peaches that I used were sweet already.  The bread that I used was a farmhouse style bread.  As suggested, I will double the recipe the next time.  Serve it with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream!

Easy and good. I'd cut back on the sugar a bit. And maybe add some flour to the peaches because it was s but runny.

I made a few changes that previous reviewers suggested.   My changes:
 whole grain bread - I like the hearty taste of wholegrain
I used a combination of nectarines and  peaches,  teaspoon of lemon juice to fruit to prevent browning, for texture pecans, added sprinkling of cinnamon to the fruit and also a little on top along with a sprinkling of sugar.  Sugar gave a nice crunch when eating.  Used 3/4 c sugar on the fruit.  
 It was amazing.   Thank you to Joan.

So so easy and delicious
I'd maybe cut a little of the sugar for the topping. Maybe it was because our peaches were sweet an spot on riped.

I have used this recipe many times, always with excellent results. The two things I did change, however, were adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the sugar, butter and egg mixture and I sprinkled the peaches with a little ground nutmeg before adding the bread over the peaches. This cobbler is especially good when serving it warm, but it is not too bad the next day by warming it a little in the microwave. I have also used strawberries instead of peaches, leaving off the nutmeg, and it turned out really good as well.

I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and added some cinnamon. This turned out AMAZING!!! It took longer to peel the peaches then to put this together. Already added this to my recipe box.

I really like this quick easy dessert. I did make some changes though. Drained canned sliced peaches and cinnamon. I was surprised that there was no cinnamon in this recipe! I didn't even measure it, I just sprinkled what I thought was an adequate amount onto the peaches and also the sugar mixture. Fantastic with vanilla ice cream.

My family loves this any time of year.  I use canned peaches packed in pear juice or no sugar added peaches.  I usually use Splenda instead of sugar due to the fact that I've had gastric bypass and excessive sugar is a no-no.  I also sprinkle cinnamon on too before putting it in the oven and make it in a 9x13 pan

Delicious and as the title says, EASY. I made a half recipe and when I saw the amount of sugar required for half, I knew there was no way I could put that much sugar in. I used slightly less than 1/3c for a half recipe.  You can't tell that it's bread under the coating.  I didn't bother to cut off the crusts.  As to serving 12 with the full recipe!!!  Let's be realistic: 8 at the absolute most, but 6 is more likely.  I'll be making this again.
