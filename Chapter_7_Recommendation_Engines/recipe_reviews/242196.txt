This recipe looked so good and I was excited about trying it for my guests.  It seemed as if the custard wasn't quite enough for the amount of bread in the casserole, and, I wish I would have gone with my instinct because it was a little dry in the morning and top of the casserole was more like a dry crunchy toast.  It is possible that the size of my french loaves were larger than what the author of the recipe used, but, since it just said (2) french loaves that is what I used. I did top with a homemade blueberry sauce, so, that definitely helped with the dryness.  I would make this again, but, just use less bread or more custard next time.

First- This is NOT French Toast; its a bread pudding.  I liked the cream cheese addition, and would encourage readers to use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of  milk. If too dry, just add more milk. Its important to make sure the bread is completely covered by the liquid before you place it in the refrigerator.

For those of you who want the original recipe (mentioned by betty), please go to www.tasteofhome.com and ask for the Blueberry French toast recipe from a 1996 magazine .  It calls for 12 slices of day old bread (crusts removed) and cut into 1 inch cubes!  I have not made the recipe yet but I will certainly give it a try.  It looks delicious!  Hope this helps solve the bread situation.

Halved the recipe and made it in a bread pan. Did not use vanilla or nutmeg (ran out) and subbed real sugar for powdered sugar (half the amount total). Also used 2/3 cup blueberries total (could probably use more if you want). Turned out delicious. Baked covered for 45 minutes and uncovered about 5. I think I'll butter the pan next time the exterior turned out crispy in my nonstick pan.  Oh and I only used enough French bread to fill the bread pan so I had about half a loaf left over. I could see this turning out dry if I used the whole loaf.

I made this for  breakfast for a long holiday weekend.  After reading some of the reviews, I increased the number of eggs, and I used half and half instead of milk, more than what was called for.  I used only 1 very large loaf of bread.  I scattered extra blueberries over the top of the casserole, and I put weights on top of the plastic wrap to ensure that the bread was covered by the liquid.  Also, I bought some blueberry syrup and poured that over it when serving it.  Next time I make it, I will remember to spray the dish with non-stick cooking spray.
This was over the top delicious, and I'm planning to make it again for our Sunday brunch at church on July 31st.

My family loved this! We make a french toast soufflé for for most major holidays, and this was a fun variation. We have someone allergic to blueberries, so I subbed it for a combination of strawberries and raspberries. I also listened to a few other reviews that said the recipe was dry, so I cut down the bread. I used like 1.3 loaves.

I've made this a couple of times and both times it was loved by all. It makes a batch for a bigger group, (or save it for a second breakfast of delicious leftovers), so you may want to cut it down for less servings. It is a bit rich with the cream cheese, but absolutely worth every bite. The last time I made it I was asking myself why I didn't make it more often - it's so easy.

Excellent and everyone loved it !  I doubled up on the cream cheese mixture so that it would cover the French bread.  I added  extra blueberries because we had just picked 7 pounds of them from our 4 blueberry bushes ! This dish did not need a topping of any kind when served. I will definitely make this again and again, and  most certainly on Christmas morning ! 
Thank you for this awesome recipe !

I've made this twice, following the recipe. The second time I used strawberries because there weren't any blueberries at the store. Strawberries = 5 stars, blueberries = 3.5 stars.

Made this the morning of the 4th of July.  Pay attention to the amount of bread.  Although I did buy 2 loaves of french bread I ended up using about 1 1/2 otherwise it would have been to much for the eggs and milk to absorb.  Delicious and recommend drizzling pure maple syrup over it.  Great recipe!

I loved it! And I used the bread mentioned but still added an extra egg because my oven gets very hot and it came out perfect, topped with a cinnamon apple crunch . It was gone in 10 minutes.

Stuck to the pan.  Need to spray the pan first.   Odd texture, spongy and soggy.  I won't be making this again.

We often make  French toast casserole when many family members are home but his was a real change. To meet all  requests I ended up using  drained frozen cherries which I had not blueberries. It was really good as voted by our group of 10.

This was ok, yummy with flaws, but I would not make again. As others have stated, it was dry, and the crust/edge along the pan tasted burnt. 
Changes I made: I cut down to 1 loaf of break after reading reviews. I also used over 2 cups of strawberries instead of 2 cups blueberries. I greased the pan too. 
This was still dry. I think the "overnight" part ruins it. It had an odd too dry, but in some parts too soggy texture. My husband did not care for the soggy bread texture.  and all long the pan the crust it formed did not taste good. Overnight the cinnamon and nutmeg settled to the bottom and was all concentrated there. When we ate this fresh out of the oven it would scoop out without the crust easily enough and I just didn't eat it. For leftovers I found myself pouring some milk on top to compensate. 
It was still really sweet and edible. If I were interested in making this again I would look up the original non-overnight recipe (someone mentions it in a review) and make that instead.

I wish that I'd gone with my first instinct to grease the dish in preparation! My Casserole dish will never be the same. This is a very tasty recipe, and it will feed an "army"!
I used one store bought French baguette, and one was all it took! Can't imagine using two. It would simply be too dry. I did add an additional cup of berries on top. Glad that I did!  It was a hit with family and friends. Certainly will make it again!

I thought this was a good recipe, but next time I'll use more cream cheese mixture and a little less bread. Plus, the bottom came out a little burned. Would some non-stick spray help due to it being refrigerated overnight?

I had to cut the recipe down since it was to serve just my husband and myself and still had a lot left over. I agree with the reviewer that said this is really a bread pudding. Since I don't really care for bread pudding I thought it was just okay. Hubby liked it a lot since he loves bread pudding. Pretty much stuck with recipe as written but used good quality white bread instead of trying to figure out the French bread quandary. Too much trouble to make again since only one of us really liked it.

Made it exactly as the recipe directed. But it took so long to bake in the morning that it wasn't worth the effort. You have to let it sit at room temperature before baking, then bake for an hour or more. It wasn't that impressive for the time it took.

The first time I made this I found the top layer of bread cubes to be hard and crunchy. So to not have that happen again I changed it up first adding a layer of dry cubes to the baking dish then covering them with half of the egg mixture, then added the blueberry cream cheese mixture (which I doubled the amount of) then before I added the remaining bread cubes I poured the remaining egg mixture into the bowl with the bread cubes to make sure they were good and saturated then spooned then on top. I also cooked the dish covered for one hour and uncovered for the last fifteen minutes. It came out perfectly!

I am not much of a cook but this went together easily. I read the reviews and reduced the bread to 1 loaf. Next time I would almost double the custard for my taste and definitely add more blueberries. It was nice and moist after baking. I used a glass pan. I served it with fresh blueberries and an option to add pure maple syrup. It was a hit.

This is a tasty recipe however, the main recipe calls for to much french bread.  I used only one loaf of French bread and still found this recipe to be more like a bread pudding.  The first time I ate it I used maple syrup as a topping which was good but upon warming it the next morning I poured milk over it and found it to be pleasing to my palette.  I definitely make this again but as a dessert.

I will definitely make it again! I made 2 servings, rather 10, as it's just two of us in the motorhome, and added chopped walnuts on top for protein. Yummy!

It was so yummy, moist and delicious! I will be making it, again, soon. I like the fact that the blueberries cut some of the sweetness, giving it a nice balance.
I did make one change, though. I used blueberry breakfast bread instead of plain bread. It added an extra kick to the blueberry flavor.

I made this for Christmas morning.  I did make 2 changes.  I used raspberries instead of blueberries and subbed mascarpone for the cream cheese.  We didn't think it was anything special.  Hubby said he would have rather had the breakfast casserole with hashbrowns and sausage.  To keep the bread submerged overnight I put a smaller dish on top of the foil and weighted it down.  We just didn't care for this and probably won't make it again.

This awesome granted used the recipe as guidelines. I used brioche bread and French bread. Added mascarpone and ricotta cheese with the cream cheese and spread that over the first layer of bread added pecans for crunch. I get asked to make this for holidays or weekend vacations with family and friends. Absolutely love it.

Not only was it a huge hit, all three grandkids begged for more.
I bought two very long loaves of bread but only used one.  Other than that, I followed directions. FABULOUS.  I'd even serve it as a dessert. It's that good.

I’ve made this several times now and people love it! I prefer to use half and half, but I’ve done it with milk, and even heavy cream if that’s what’s on hand. It always turns out fine. Also, I like to add a handful of raspberries and/or strawberries to the equation. Great recipe!

Fantastic recipe; we've prepared this on Christmas eve for the past 5 years and we just love it. Easy to do the night before and then put it in the oven as we sit around the tree opening presents while the french toast cooks. We make a blueberry sauce for it while it finishes cooking.

I don’t know how this recipe only has four stars. It is amazing! I have made it several times and always get rave reviews. I do reduce the cream cheese to one block because to me two is a little much, but other than that it is great as is!

I thought this recipe had great flavor.  The bread was a little dry on top.  So, next time I will add a few more eggs and extra milk.  I also added cinnamon to the egg mixture just because we love cinnamon.  I will make again

I made this and it is delicious. If some of these reviewers are seasoned cooks then they should have known to decrease the amount of bread or add more milk or half and half.  I used those small long french bread loafs (baguette). It was perfect. All it takes is a little common sense people. Great recipe Joshua, thanks for posting.

Has become a special requested brunch item!  I use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, & sometimes have substituted bread with day old bakery cocktail size croissants. I also used 9 eggs.  It has a luscious consistency, but is not "sickening" sweet.  I agree with the author of the recipe, Joshua;  It's great with maple (pure) syrup, whipped cream or nothing at all!! I have also tried it with blackberries.  Yum!!

It would have been helpful to know how many cups of bread cubes rather than how many loaves. Mine turned out dry because my loaves must've been too big, but I'll definitely try again.

After I made this, cut it into serving pieces and put half in the freezer for another time.  It warms up nicely and does not need syrup but I did add more fresh blueberries when served.  Cream cheese make a nice filling.  Barbara Glass

Made this for breakfast today, the only thing I changed was I used gluten free bread. It was good we liked it. It was more like bread pudding. Next time I would spray or butter the bottom and sides of the pan. Was really good will make it again.

I made this and it was delicious! What I especially loved about it was that it wasn't too sweet and it had a wonderful flavor! However, I did change quantities of the cream cheese mixture.  I one and a halved the filling and added extra blueberries on top!

Tasted great. My fault i hadn't noticed tip at end so had lots of trouble trying to get cream cheese mixture spread. Definitely needs more milk.

I made mine in the Tupperware Microwave stack cooker this morning.  Because it's so deep I used 13 eggs and almost 1/4c cup of milk for the cream cheese batter.  I used 1-1/2 loaves of French bread and omitted the nutmeg and added a little extra cinnamon.  I am letting it sit and set up firm before inverting it onto a plate or pan.

I halved the recipe, since there are only 2 of us. It was a hit. 
We grow blueberries so I'm always looking for ways to use them in recipes. (we also make wine from our blueberries, blackberries & raspberries. But the blueberry wine is the best)

This recipe has tremendous potential, but the measurements need to be tweaked in order to make it a five star dish.  Having read comments from other reviewers that the casserole turned out too try, I followed the recipe exactly but used only 1 French loaf rather than 2.  The blueberry/cream cheese component was a little much (dish came out a touch soggy), in this case, but the egg "topping" part was just enough.   My husband and I did really enjoy the dish, and I will be sure to make it again.

I was not impressed with this recipe at all.  It was okay but not nearly as good as just plain ole blueberry crisp.  It was not at all like French toast.   This was very doughy and actually kind of dry.  I even doubled the amount of blueberries and it still wasn't enough.
