My fianc√© requested Black Forest Cake for his birthday, and I had never made it from scratch before. This was uncomplicated and delicious. I did use Cherry Pie filling instead of canned Cherries. Next time, I think I will use less liquor throughout and more whipping cream and powdered sugar (the alcohol could be tasted, and there wasn't enough filling / icing to cover the cake).
