Caution: This recipe calls for caesar dressing, which is not vegetarian, as it contains anchovy paste. Look for anchovy-free caesar dressing at your local health food store. Whatever you do, please don't make this with anchovy caesar dressing and feed it to your vegetarian friends, asserting that it is vegetarian!

I served this as a dip but the crowd was spooning it on their plates and eating it as a side item.  I didn't get a chance to taste it for myself.  The reviews were, WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS GREAT, IS THERE MORE?

I served this dip with wheat thins and french bread. I also left out the hot sauce and it was a big hit at a party. The bowl was clean by the time it was over.

I found this recipe a few years back and made it on a whim. I'm glad I did because since then, it has been the hit of every party and is a traditional snack for New Years Eve celebrations. I love this dip! There is nothing bad about it at all.  It's really quite tasty and easy to make. If you have a taste for good things and can follow simple directions, this dip will turn out fantastic!

Sorry, don't see what all the fuss is about.  The dip was soupy and salty....I added extra cheese to make it firm enough for a cracker.  Will not make this again.

I liked this recipe. I substituted cream cheese for the sour cream to thicken it up. I also had to add garlic because everything tastes better with garlic :) Overall good recipe and I will make it again at my next get together.

I thought this was pretty good...not the best but pretty good. I would make again except not another person in my family liked this.  I guess I'll just have to finish the leftovers by myself tomorrow.

doubled the recipe with ease, used lo-fat dressing, mayo & sour cream, a can of diced toms w/ garlic & onion but no swiss cheese (forgot to purchase).  super good.  i suggest using a good quality caesar like cardini's.

This appetizer goes great with cold beer and good friends.  Just what I was looking for!  I used fire roasted diced/canned/drained tomatoes, and served the dip with Triscits.  Yummy!

I made this for my Bunco night and everyone commented how good it was.  I didn't put the sour cream in (because I forgot & used all the sour cream for my veggie dip and it was too late to run to the store) and I FORGOT to put the hot pepper sauce in! ugh. But it tasted great!! I will make it again.

This was another dip that I didn't bother measuring the ingredients. The salad dressing sounded like it would be a bit much for the amount of artichokes, so after adding the other ingredients, I drizzled it in until it looked right. Instead of the tomatoes, I used bruschetta which added a nice garlicky flavor. So good Evie and thanks!

Although this tasted pretty good, I won't make it again bc it came out of the oven a soupy brown ugly mess.  Thankfully I took it to a small gathering, it looked awful, but everyone gave me a pity try and said it tasted good.  It finally firmed up the way I would've liked it around the time it got cold.  For clarification's sake, I added way more cheese to try to thicken, I won't try this one again.

I increased the hot pepper sauce and used canned diced tomatoes---looks great, tastes even better and several commented that it tasted like it had salame or meat in it.  Gee, great idea to add some chopped salame in it!

I absolutely love this recipe, and I don't even like artichokes! My friends and family rave about it everytime. It is creamy and filling and the tomatoes add great color. I use vine tomatoes instead of plum. Make sure you chop those artichokes well so that you get a piece in every bite.

This recipe is crazy good!  That caesar gives a great tang, slightly different from all of the other artichoke dip recipes.  Will definitely make again & again!

Made this last night and everyone loved it.  Only thing I didn't like was all the oil from the cheeses that separated from the dip.  Stirred it a couple of times but it seperated eventually.  Will definitely make it again tho.

I've been trying various artichoke all have been fairly good, but the family really likes this one.  Followed the recipe as is and turned out great.  Will be doing this one for the Super Bowl Party.

I like this better than any artichoke dip I've made.  The Ceaser dressing is perfect and I was able to use a favorit fat free brand and it was delicious, even my husband enjoyed it who doesn't care for artichokes!

AWESOME!!!! I read the reviews regarding the dip being "soupy," and became concerned because you should never make a dish for the first time, when serving to a party.  However, I was sure to PIT THE TOMATOES and drain the artichoke good.  This includes not only draining the artichoke, but squeezing the excess out after chopping.  I also added green onion chives.  Note, this isn't really spicy...if you want a kick, add more than what it calls for, but I love a bite to everything.  I could have made double or triple the single recipe because it was gone before anything else.  Highly recommended!  Will make again soon!!

After reading the rave reviews I decided to make this for a Christmas get together. Not a hit at all. In fact after trying unsuccessfully to 'doctor it up' a little we resigned the battle & threw most of it away.

YUM!  Made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  The next morning, we were eating it cold for breakfast.  Made a few modifications.... added spinach (wonderful color!) and increased the hot sauce.  Served it in a chafing dish to keep warm.

I brought this to my girlfriend's halloween party. It was gobbled up before I could try it! It got RAVE reviews and the bowl was practically licked clean...so, I simply must give it 5 stars! Thanks!

This went over VERY well at a recent get together.  The only problem was that it went too fast and the guests wanted more.

This dip was pretty good but it wasn't fabulous. It tasted better the next day. It
is very rich and heavy and is somewhat overpowered by all the creamy taste. The
part I liked the best was the caesar spin. Not sure I'd make it again.

After reading all of the wonderful reviews, I was disappointed in this recipe.  It came out really greasy and it didn't look very appealing.  It just tasted okay.  I was expecting alot more.

I would lessen the amount of the Ceasar dressing, but that is my personal preference.  Very tasty.  Everyone liked it.

I prepared this recipe for my Supper club and it received great comments!!.  This appetizer is very easy and quick to make and is highly recommended.  Everyone was asking - "who made the artichoke dip?"  I will share this recipe with all of my friends!

Not a fan, sorry! Made this for my family early Tgiving and it’s too salty and too much artichoke. We all tried but didn’t go back for seconds.

wasn't sure why it called for an 8x8 dish; it barely covered the bottom, when it came out of oven it was "oily".

This had good flavor but I do have to admit it did separate and become a little greasy. We enjoyed it for dinner but isn't something I would serve at a party because of that greasy appearance on  the top. I did use a higher end dressing in this but it could be thats what caused the issue I'm not sure. I would make it again for us to eat just not to serve to company.

I don't like artichoke dip but I took this over to my sister's and everyone really liked the flavor.  It did start to seperate due to the cheese I guess.  I also added some cream cheese (a couple TBSP of the chive variety...needed to use it up)because I was afraid it'd be too runny but was pleased with the consistency.  I think the quality of caesar dressing is important for this dish, I used Marzetti's Simply Caesar (in the refrigerated case in produce section).
