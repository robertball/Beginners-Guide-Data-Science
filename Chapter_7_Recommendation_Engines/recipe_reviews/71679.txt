I added finely chopped chicken and used cilantro flavored tortillas. I cut them into 8 slices and served them as appetizers. Delicious!!

I thought these were good. I used pepperjack instead of mozz. and feta, and added a little canned corn on top of the beans. Extremely fast to make and handy for a weeknight dinner.

These were very good and the sour cream was definately the best part of the meal!  I left out the feta and actually added corn and tomatoes.  Very light and easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love, love, loved!  We love mexican and quesadillas at my house!  This was a great twist on the classic quesadillas.  I served them for a bridal shower and they were a big hit.  The sour cream portion is just great too.  My husband kept complaining that he wasn't allowed to use it as I was saving it for the shower:)

Really good--I used this recipe to make 4 quesadillas instead of 2 (held together better with less bean/salsa/cheese filling).  Also, left out the feta/mozzarella mixture and subst. co-jack cheese, which tasted great.  LOVED the cilantro sour cream, which also goes great with the taco bake recipe listed elsewhere on this site.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  Even though I love to try new things, I much rather prefer the traditional Mexican toppings in this case.  The mozzarella/feta didn't sit well with me.  Sorry!

The first time I made this recipe, I used 2 10" tortillas folded in half.  The second time I used 4 8" tortillas, which made flipping & cutting a mess.  I left out the feta cheese (didn't have any) and used Pace salsa with Cilantro.  I've made this using fresh and dried cilantro, and fresh is definitely the way to go!

Cilantro sour cream was light and refreshing.
