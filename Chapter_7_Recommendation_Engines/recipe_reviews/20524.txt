I don't understand the poor ratings that this recipe has been given!  This flan is great.  It's definitely not the over-dense, over-syrupy-sweet American flan, this is real, fabulous flan.  It's sweet without being overpowering, and holds together tightly without being dense.  It's light and beautiful when it's done!  Definitely party-worthy.  I did make some changes: (1)Doubled the recipe and used 8 eggs (didn't differentiate between whites and whole eggs).  (2) Added 2 t. of vanilla.  (3) Put it in two large ceramic dishes. (4) Added 1 c. of heavy cream (1/2 c., if you didn't double the recipe).  It turned out absolutely marvelous!  I'll definitely be making it again.

So easy and so perfect!  I wanted to make flan to go with a Mexican dinner, but didn't have condensed or evaporated milk, (which most of the flan recipes call for).  I followed the recipe (adding NO vanilla) and both my husband and I thought the caramel flavoring was all it needed.  I had no problem melting the sugar.  Just remember to use only medium heat so it doesn't cook too fast.  Thanks for a great, simple flan recipe!

As a poor college student, this is the easiest and cheapest recipe for flan I've come accross. It's hard to make flan without a fully stocked kitchen but this recipe works well. I would recommend adding vanilla or almond extract as it can really only add to the flavor of the recipe.

I personally had my doubts being a sweetened condenced milk user.  However i was out and needed some flan for dessert so I gave this a try. I found it works out GREAT! The 2 changes I made were to add butter to the melting sugar, 1 cup sugar to 1 Tbls butter. This helps it to not turn hard immediately. Second I traded 1/2 the milk for heavy cream. It turned out better then my usual kind. This is out new "Family and Party Favorite"

Flan is one of my favorite desserts but I didn't enjoy this version as much as another recipe I've tried from this site.  It didn't set up as I'd hoped and I really prefer the kind made with condensed milk.  Glad I gave it a shot.  Thanks anyway Bobby.

This is easy to make and tastes great. Instead of melting sugar, though, which i didn't like, you can use maple syrup too. I tried that the second time i made this and I thought it was better than the time I used sugar.

First try:  as written.  Found it rather thin.  2nd try, used half whole milk, and half heavy whipping cream.  Increased eggs to 2 whole eggs, 3 egg yolks.  I used 1 tsp vanilla per recipe.  I think it could actually stand another egg yolk.  Added the heavy cream at the end and just blended it in so it wouldn't whip or turn to butter.  After much reading about the caramelized sugar, I agree that it should *NOT* be stirred at all.  IOW, you don't set the pan on the burner and stir until it's melted.  I used a small saucepan and shifted the sugar around by moving the pan, over medium heat.  When it started melting, I turned the burner (gas) up on high and moved the pan around above the flame.  When it turned the color of amber (no darker or it will burn), I poured it into the pan and had enough time to swirl it around before it hardened.  Warming the dish first also gives you time to swirl it.  I let it cool to the touch before putting in the custard mix.  I made 2 recipes for guests: one with sugar and caramel, one with Splenda (less than called for) and sugar-free marmalade in the dish so it would be on top when flipped. No appreciable difference in taste between sugared custard and Splenda.  I used 1.5 qt Pyrex dishes to bake; took about 1.5 hours.  It curdled sligthly at the bottom and around the edges but was set and creamy in the middle, and really delicious.  Several experts pronounced it superior to the recipes made with sweetened condensed milk.

An excellent flan recipe. Easy to make with all ingredients you probably already have in the kitchen. Make exactly according to "preparation" directions and it comes out perfect. However I did "tweak" the recipe a tad. So I will demerit 1 star. I Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 cup of half and half in place of one cup milk for a richer flavor. Very delcious. :)

Didn't care for it much. I've made plenty of flans before (I'm puertorican, this is a staple dessert down there) and this one is so-so. Adding hot milk to eggs is not such a great idea either. You have to be really careful or you'll end up cooking the eggs with the hot milk. Caramel is the easiest thing to do. Use the microwave!!! Add some water to the sugar in a glass container and heat it up in high for a few minutes (until you see it turn that beautiful amber color). Have done it countless times that way, believe me.

SMOOTH & CREAMY!  This was my first time making flan and it was so easy.  Perfect instructions!  I used 2% milk by mistake but couldn't have had better results.  I will use it next time too!  Thank you Bobby Kleinveld for sharing your recipe!

Great recipe. I added some vanilla essence and served with fresh berries. The one lesson I learnt was to not stir the sugar while caramelizing - it will crystalize. Had to toss my first batch of sugar.

Easy and delicious, but the recipe should've included a flavoring measurement, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I was definitely glad that I added about 1/2 tsp. vanilla otherwise it would've been quite bland.  I didn't notice any excessive "egginess" that some other reviewers mentioned.  It IS a custard, after all, so you have to expect a bit of egg flavor!  As an FYI for folks trying to save calories, I used 1 3/4 C. skim milk and 1/4 C. half-n-half (that's what happened to be in my fridge), and it still set up just fine and had a lovely silky texture.

I loved this recipe!  My finished product still had some crystalized sugar left in the bottom of my custard cups, but it might be the way I melted my sugar.  Next time, I do think I will add a bit of water to the "caramel" and a little vanilla extract to the custard to give it a bit more richness.

This is a great recipe! The custard is so smooth, and the caramel tastes great. This recipe is also known as Creme Caramel. The only problem was that boiling the sugar didn't work out well, so I put in the same amount of water to sugar. This made the sugar turn golden and syrupy, which worked great. Also, I added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla to the custard. I would definitly use this recipe again!

I admit it, I'm a Flan Fan.  The recipe has potential and definitely need a tsp of vanilla.  If you make it in one big pan, I think it needs to cook longer, 40 minutes can give you a soggy mess.  This is good, not too sweet.

This is a beautiful flan with a great texture - smooth and creamy, but firm enough to cut with a spoon. I added a tsp of good quality vanilla, but it wasn't necessary, if you prefer the sweet eggy flavor. For ease of preparation, I heated the milk in the sauce pan with the caramel residue, which dissolves the caramelized sugar into the milk, adding to the custard's flavor. This recipe is a keeper. By the way, if you're going to bake the cups in an aluminum pan, you should sprinkle a little cream of tartar into the water (NOT the flan) to keep the inside of the pan from oxidizing (turning dark).

THANK YOU!!!  I spent over an hour combing the internet looking for a milk-only custard/flan recipe.  All the others have evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and/or heavy cream -- none of which I have on hand today.  My craving for my mother's baked custard has been satisfied!  I substitued 2 tablespoons of Kahlua for equal amount reduced from milk, per another recipe found here on AllRecipes.  YUM!

I made it today. Perfect! Finally, an authentic recipe that starts with fresh milk and eggs! Tasty, easy, wonderful!  Make sure you use whole milk and large or extra large eggs. Constant stirring at every step until you put it in the ramekins is important to keep it from burning or lumping.

With ingredients that are normally found in our house, this recipe is a keeper.  I used 4 eggs so I wouldn't waste any yolk and it came out just fine. Thanks for recipe.

Loved the custard, but did not do well with the melted sugar, no one complained about the melted sugar tried to make it three times came out with hard crack candy (immediately) when I poured it into the ramkins, so just went to the maple syrup and put a little brown sugar and all was fine. Will make again with the brown sugar and maple syrup, that is why I gave it a four.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Thanks for sharing it, Bobby.

I've found that 6 minutes in the microwave leaves my milk at the perfect temperature with zero fuss, just in time to pour the sugar (which seems to work best when added to an already hot pot with a thimblefull of water).

This flan came out very good. The consistency was nice and light and tasted great. I did add a little vanilla and a slightly generous amount of rum, lol. The caramel, unfortunately, did not turn out very good. I'm assuming I burnt it a little. It's not horrible, but it definitely has that burnt flavor to it and some of it hardened in all my custard cups (which was kind of hard to clean up :P). So you might want to have the custard mixture ready to pour in right after the caramel is in the cups? I think next time I might try that maple syrup/brown sugar thing I saw mentioned, or just be careful not to cook it too long if I experiment with the sugar caramel again. Definitely would make this again. Also, this is probably not for those that think of flan as very sweet and rich.

Beautiful and easy! I was also looking for a recipe that didn't require evaporated or condensed milk, and this got a resounding thumbs-up from the whole family. I added a bit of cream to my nonfat milk, and a dash of vanilla (I'm sure it would taste fine without). Will definitely make this again.

Pretty good considering how easy it is. I like it as a base recipe you can dress up however you like. I added a tsp of vanilla, some orange zest and  subbed in 1/2 a cup of sweetened condensed milk for a 1/2 cup of the reg. milk, turned out great! My mom suggested a bit of rum next time. But my friend Leah's suggestion of Grand Marnier sounded really yummy :)

Fast and awesome.  What more can one expect?  Thank you, I truly enjoyed this flan.  I remember when my nana used to beat the egg yolks for hours and cook the milk for hours too...

This is hard to mess up!  I used 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch instead of 2 egg yolks...came out flippin' fantastic!!  You must be a fan of this type of dessert to appreciate it. My boyfriend didn't like it, but he isn't a fan of desserts with the custard type texture. I didn't use a dishcloth underneath and it still came out perfect!

This was awesome! I didn't have custard cups so I did the flans in two glass pie pans. I just did two recipes of the sugar topping and put one in each pan. Be careful not to overcook the sugar... I did in one of them and it came off with a wee bit of a burnt flavor to it. The only thing about doing big ones is that you have to be super careful taking them out of the pan. One of mine fell to pieces... but the family still devoured it :)

I love flan and mine didn't turn out as well as I hoped.  Next time, I will use someone else's idea of using maple syrup.  I think it will be easier and will have the same taste.

this came out wonderfully, i was able to use basic ingredients and 2% milk. You can get away with even less sugar. I think traditionalists miss the richness of crema and other canned goods. But for a quick easy light dessert its good. If your just making it for family you can skip the water bath and it just won't be as pretty.

While it may not be authentic, amazing flan, you cannot find an easier recipe!  I had company over for a Mexican-themed dinner and realized I didn't have any dessert prepared.  It was a risk trusting a recipe that didn't call for any of the usual dairy fats, but this worked very well and came out deliciously.  

ADD A TEASPOON OF VANILLA EXTRACT.  That's my only tweak.  Really, it's good for what it is!

Caveat - It's a great recipe if you don't have the ingredients to use a different recipe.  If you have more time to think ahead or are thoughtful enough to keep things like condensed/evaporated milk or heavy cream around, use a different recipe.

This was an easy recipe and it looked great when I turned it out. I doubled the recipe and added orange zest, juice and a little almond extract to put a twist on it, but even so we all thought it was bland.  It needs to be a bit sweeter and I possible may have had the sugar a little too dark.  I might try this again.

I used cage free brown eggs (which have a thicker yolk) and I also used 1/2 and 1/2 rather thn mile so that may have had something to do with it but this was so creamy the texture was great! Also, I've never used a wet towel in the bottom of the pan, I didn't have any bubbles in my flan! I should add that using white sugar for the carmilzing is a must. I used organic cane juice sugar, which is silghtly brownish and more coarse than white sugar it burned badly.   I will use this recipe again!

This is a very good, simple recipe.  It also helped to have the step by step instructions about how to prepare the pan with water etc.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract and it turned out perfectly.

I'm a Cuban America.  My family has a long tradition of making flans, bread puddings, and Spanish custards...  Avoid this recipe.  The amount of eggs is not sufficient for the custard to set.  I tried making this recipe because I'm no longer in South Florida and flans are difficult to come by where I attend college.  I was attracted to the resourcefulness of recipe, no special ingredients only whole milk, eggs, and sugar... this will not work.  You're better off using condensed and evaporated milk.  Sadly, I wasted 4 whole eggs, two cups of milk and sugar...

This was absolutely gorgeous. I was wondering if it might need vanilla, but it totally did not. Wonderful as is! (I used goat milk b/c I am allergic to cow milk -- that's the only thing I did differently. I'm sure cow milk would be just as good.)

I almost gave this four stars, but it just didn't have the flan flavor I was looking for.  I made it because I had all of the ingredients, which wasn't the case for the other flan recipes.  It was okay, but it tasted too egg-y.  Not bad, and worth a try if you just really want to make flan and can't make a run to the store, but I will be trying a different recipe this time.

This was so delicious!  I did follow a couple of other reviews and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and used 1 cup of cream and 1 cup milk, since I was using 1% milk...  This was such a treat and will make it again....

Light. I did use 2% milk with a little less than a full can of evaporated milk. Beat the eggs whole. Added some vanilla cognac (Navan) but didn't taste it much. Made a dulche de leche sauce from AR and used that instead of the caramelized sugar. Would make again.

This was a nice alternative to a traditional flan recipe.  Not quite as rich and creamy, but certainly tasty!  However, did make a couple of changes.  First, I have a bottle of caramel syrup from a Cuban market in Florida and used that instead of cooking the sugar.  The syrup is perfect for flan, and very simple.  For the custard, I used one extra egg yolk and added a teaspoon of vanilla after reading reviews here.  I only had 2% milk, and also added about 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  The flan was quite good, came out of the ramekins easily and had set up nicely.  I plan on keeping this recipe for whenever I want to make flan but don't have the usual ingredients on hand.  Thanks!

Perfection, a great dessert for those who don't like a whole lot of sugar in their dessert. For me the hardest part was working with the caramelized sugar. At first I decided to microwave it with just a bit of water but it burned too quickly. I ended up making the caramel on the stove and it turned out fine. Work with it quickly because the caramel hardens fast! I'll probably make it again and again because it doesn't require too many ingredients and overall the recipe is very simple

Flan for the purist.  I made it exactly as described.  Creamy texture, just the right amount of sweetness -- and because it called for very basic ingredients I could make it with what items I normally have on hand.  I will definitely be making this again.

My whole family loved this recipe! I used skim milk and it still tasted rich and sweet. I also used vanilla and rum extracts, as someone else suggested, and baked it for 45 minutes, using the 6-serving option. It set up perfectly and unmolded beautifully. I will use this low-fat recipe often!

I have tried this a few of times, the sugar that is melted and put in the cups hardens immediatly (God help you if you spill it COS IT STICKS AND BURNS!!!) My husband thinks the the sugar is bitter(tried both white and brown) so tried maple syrup wasn't alot better. So think will put sugar on top and put in grill for couple of minutes until carmalized as a creme brulee really should be done. Other then that change it is quite nice

This is the mangiest flan recipe ever. Try Creamy Caramel Flan instead. It's not traditional but it is way better.

I did not like this recipe at all. Flan was blan, and the only strong taste was that of eggs. There needs to be something added to this recipe to help out the flavor. It was a real waste of perfectly good ingredients. I will not make this again, and neither should you.

This was one of the easiest recipes to follow. I am more than glad to have this recipe by my side that really came out to the best final touches. I would recommend this to anyone who just has eggs and 2 percent milk, and no evaporated and condensed milk. There was an altercation to my recipe that I had prepared with this one, which was that I added Chocolate Caramel coffee creamer to my milk, and added cocoa powder with the sugar that was for the caramelized topping. This is just a generic flan recipe, but it was the basic one. If you want to make a different kind of flan, like the Mexican-style custard, or even a cream cheese flan, this really wouldn't be the recipe to go ahead and start on. Also, be ready to make sure your flan is cooked right, in order to be able to set it on the platter correctly. If you use PAM spray all over and coat with it on your metal or glass pan, the flan comes right out in perfection. Really glad I found this recipe, did not let me down and I would do it again.

This tastes exactly like flan from a restaurant and it came out perfect. I didn't have white sugar, just raw sugar and it worked great.  Also I wasn't about to make it out of condensed milk. I don't even know what that is so I was very happy to find this recipe.  Yay flan!

Simple, CREAMY, and totally satisfying.  WHO needs all the fancy-pants recipes that call for cream or condensed milk?!?  NOT ME.  This is old-school, perfect baked custard with caramel that your grandmama used to make.  I was hesitant to try this, but once made, me and my co-workers were happily reminded that sometimes, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) works best.

Loved this! I added vanilla and used brown sugar. I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and warmed it in the microwave and smeared it on the bottom of a single 8 by 7 Pyrex dish. I used 3 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs and 2 cups of 1 percent milk. Other than that I followed the recipe. Turned out great!! U can definitely make more than 4 servings out of this!

I chose this recipe because I could easily substitute the ingredients for a healthier version. I doubled the recipe and used 11 packets truvia and unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of sugar and milk. . Very nice! Of course it would be wonderful with cream or half n half (and if you are on the "belly fat diet" I guess that would be ok) I used my own sugar free maple syrup instead of melted sugar and it was nice. Next I'll try melting truvia to see what happens. Basic flan that helps the dieter get by with sweetness and protein.

A great recipe. It is creamy, rich, and delicious, but it doesn't use many ingredients. A keeper! Just be sure not to burn the sugar, or it will taste bitter and you wont be able to wash it out of the ramekins.

This recipe is fantastic!  I add a teaspoon of vanilla and I use skim milk.  So good!  Makes me look like a real pro.  Just one thing about the baking time, I leave it in the oven for an hour.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and just used 4 whole eggs for this, along with half whipping cream/half milk, and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  Superb!  I am so happy to find this recipe that doesn't use canned milk.  The texture and flavor was much better than another recipe I tried before.  It was so smooth and creamy.  Did have an eggy flavor, but that's to be expected.  Thanks so  much for sharing the recipe!

I also added vanilla, turned out great. Its not as rich as other recipes but still good. I strained the milk and egg mixture through a metal strainer before baking,as i would recommend with any flan,  it makes it much smoother.You'd be surprised how many little egg chunkies you get out.

Delicious and not too sweet.  I chose this recipe because I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk on hand.  I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream, and 3 egg yolks + 1 whole egg.  I had a few bubbles in it, but it was still a hit.

I wonder why people had such a hard time with this one.  It worked fine for me, and I even used mostly 2% milk. I had a TINY bit of evaporated milk left over from making sweet potato pie, so I used some of that as well. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I did have a hard time melting the sugar, it started to burn before it was melted so I had to throw it away and start over, adding a little bit of water like I usually do. The only thing I would do different next time is to mix it better, it came out really ugly. Everything else is fine. I think I will use this one from now on so I don't have to buy condensed and evaporated milk.

I've never made flan before, because the caramel part was a little daunting. I made this (with fresh goat milk, even!) and it was as delicate and sumptuous as could be! I've also made the recipe as a savory, with leeks and bacon, omitting the sugar and caramel.

We call this recipe Creme Caramel and it is indeed the easiest dessert to make, i always add vanilla to offset the "egginess" of the custard, alternatively you can use a small amount of orange essence and a bit of grated orange rind to give it a different flavour. But anyway you look at it, this is delicious and easy to prepare and cook.

This dessert was a flop. I made it for guests and the egg seemed curdled in the dishes. The consistency wasn't smooth at all, and when I attempted to flip them out of their cup-cake shaped dishes, they fell apart and made a big mess. Also, the original amount of sugar called for in the caramelizing step is too little for the amount of flan mixture that is made. There needs to be about double the amount of caramel to suit the amount of flan mixture. The taste was ok, but a little too eggy. The texture was worse. Next time I'll follow a recipe that uses condensed milk.

I love the simplicity of the ingredients, and loved substituting New Hampshire maple syrup for the melted sugar to give it a little New England flair.

This recipe reminds me of the flan my family made when I was a girl. It was perfectly, delicately sweet. The texture is silky smooth. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla because I love the flavor.

The only change I made was adding a splash of vanilla.  I added it only because my partner ALWAYS wants vanilla in desserts.
The one worry I had was when, after melting the sugar and pouring it into the little dishes, it immediately hardened.  I couldn't let it run to cover the bottom.  I soldiered on and followed the instructions.  It turned out fine.  The sugar returned to liquid and my partner declared it a winner!
I will make it again as there are so few ingredients, it's easy to make and it is a winner

This flan recipe is better than any I have tried, because it wasn't too sweet, and you don't have to make a special sauce for it.
I have made it about 5 times now, and I hope to make it a lot more in the future. Love it!!!

Caramel burns!  I have the blister to prove it.  That being said, it is a new favorite recipe for my family  and I will be more careful next time.
I made this the first time for a party of 20, in multiple batches.  Burned myself in first batch.  Second batch was much easier to deal with because I knew what to expect.  When working with the caramel, pour small amount into the ramekins, then swirl to cover sides when done pouring.  It is a little more forgiving than you would think.  OR>>> instead of the caramel, sprinkle brown sugar to cover the bottom of the ramekins.  You can turn it out and use the torch to caramelize or leave as is and eat from the ramekin.

Amazing recipe. Mine turned out great. And to be extra fancy I melted some additional sugar at the end and poured it on the baking mat into various shapes to stick them in the finished desserts. Everyone was in awe

If what you are expecting is the heavy solid flan typically served in america this isn't it.   This is very light, delicate and dissolves in your mouth.    OK if it's what you wanted.    None of my group cared for it.

This was my first time making Flan . . . and it turned out pretty good! I think I did make a slight error in that while I was melting the sugar, I think I let it cook a little too long. I had stirred the sugar, which created sugar clumps, and in order to get the clumps to dissolve, I had to cook it a little longer. I wonder if you're not supposed to stir it?? Anyways, it still turned out fantastic! The only adjustments I made was to use half & half, as I had exactly 2 cups that needed to be used up, and I added a tad bit of vanilla. This makes a beautiful presentation on a plate with fresh berries on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good. Picture I posted didn’t do it justice. I couldn’t wait till it cooled to eat. Left one in the fridge overnight and it turned out looking like restaurant quality. Best tasting Flan I’ve ever eaten. Best of you let it cool properly, but I’m weak, so there...

I made this with 1/2 cup Swerve sweetener instead of using sugar for the keto diet. Turned out nice and better than other recipes I've used. Nice it doesn't require sweetened condensed milk. Didn't do any sugar glaze/syrup as I just wanted the custard part. Will be making this again.

The best flan, without the calories. Can be made in one dish. On top of stove in a double boiler or baked. Optional, top with Cool Whip or cream. Good breakfast dish with some fruit.

I honestly loved this recipe. The taste was so close to an Asian flan which obviously, fit my tastebud completely due to my craving of an Asian flan taste when I came to America. I did add about a small spoon of vanilla extract and a bit of condense milk just to make it more flavorable. I also added one more egg just so it can be more dense. although I had some trouble with the caramel base, after I baked the flan, 1/3 of my caramel was still hard. Any suggestions for the caramel to melt easier?

This is a good basic recipe. Flan is an egg custard dessert and this recipe is using the simplest basic ingredient to make custard. The texture is just good. The only thing I would add for this recipe (for people used to eat commercial made flans!) is putting some vanilla extract or seasonings like cinnamon in caramel. The pure egg custard flan is perfect for children and people who trying to eat healthy(by simple ingredients) with no additional heavy cream in the ingredients list. Also, next time I make it for kids, I would omit caramel part for them??

This was so simple to make!  This was my first time making flan and I followed the recipe pretty much exactly - the only change I made was that I used 1/2 cup cream for 1/2 cup of the milk (I had some cream I wanted to use up).  I wondered about putting the damp cloth in the bottom of the pan - I guess it has something to do with regulating the temperature around the custard cups?  anyhow, I did as the recipe said and it worked out perfectly.  The flan was delicious and a real treat!

I made this flan in one big pan instead of smaller individual ones. The flavor was great but the texture was too much like eggs. Maybe it will work better in a flan pan?

Simplest most delicate, decadent Milk Flan/Custard on the planet.  Of note, please do NOT stir sugar that will coat your ramekin(s) and don't over darken.  To add "flavor" to your Flan, use "light" flavors, remember this is a very light dessert.  Use a little vanilla, almond, orange, anise or other type flavoring.  I use the skin of a Lime after incorporating the sugar when "scalding" the milk.  I also completely chill the milk prior to adding the 4 "whole" eggs.  Never failed me yet.  Good Luck.

Although I haven't made this exact recipe, I have a recipe that is almost identical to this that was given to me by a vietnamese lady except everything is upped to make 13-14 servings and with the addition of rum and vanilla extract. I will say that I prefer the recipe with whole milk (like this) instead of condensed milk. It's much less dense than the Spanish style flan.

This is so good. Made Mixture of Milk and Sugar to add Egg, then used a strainer to make it silky texture and dropped Vanilla bit. Baked about 50 minutes.

This was great! The only thing I changed was add a teaspoon ish of vanilla. Made it for my dad's birthday and he loved it!

This flan is smooth.  I'm a new cook so I wasn't  clear on carmelizing the sugar ( I added 2 tablespoons water and a drop of lemon)

The recipe is so easy and still one of the best flans I've ever eaten.  Thinking I'd messed it up anyway after I added the sugar to the dishes I added a tablespoon of amaretto to two of them.  All four turned out amazing.  

I will be keeping this recipe for sure. Thank you.

Turned out great. Hubby & father-in-law devored it. This was one of the few flan recipes I could find w/o sweetened condensed milk, which I didn't have and didn't want to go to the store. We had lots of half-n-half, so I used that for the "milk."

Wow this awesome flan. It is just like how my mother's taste. I used brown sugar instead and used a little bit less sugar and also strained the liquid after adding the egg so no cooked egg would be there. The taste was amazing too, not too sweet but not too dull and really smooth. Thanks!!!

Really liked it.  Per the reviews and what I had in my kitchen I tweaked the recipe. Replaced: white sugar for organic brown sugar.  Added: 1/2 cup non-fat greek yoghurt, 1 tbs chia seeds, and 1 tbs starbucks hot chocolate mix.

I give this 5 stars for the flavor and texture, although I messed up and tried to make a large flan instead of individuals.  It didn't unmold too well.  Next time I'll do individuals for sure, but this is as good as any flan I've ever eaten in Mexico, maybe better than most.
