The BEST taco seasoned meat recipe that I have come across.   I have even made a batch where I added the juice of a half a lime...and that was a fantastic taste experience.  I also used only 1/4 tsp salt and omitted the onion powder and added shallots (only because of personal sensitivity to onions).  Try it , if you haven't!  This recipe also makes an excellent base for chili.

I already had cooked ground turkey in the freezer, so just added the spices and water and simmered as directed.  The brown sugar & vinegar added a subtle flavor that I really liked!  I used the meat to make a salad of leaf lettuce, grape tomatoes, chick peas, avocado, cheddar cheese, cilantro & ranch dressing.  Have saved this recipe to make again!

Delicious! The brown sugar adds a nice dimension to flavor. I added a tbsp of cornstarch to help thicken the mixture. Throw out those sodium-laden premixed versions you buy at the store and try this. You'll get hooked on the taste and you'll be surprised at how easy it is. Thank you for the recipe.

Phenomenal!!! I followed it exactly with no adjustments. I do serve fresh lime on the table and encourage my guests to use a few however! I prefer this to ANY ground beef dish! Turkey Tostadas are a new favorite with this recipe. Thanks!! ??

This was quite good. I usually hate the taste of turkey, especially turkey burgers, but this had good flavor. I thought the amount of apple cider vinegar listed would be too much, but that wasn't the case. The only thing I changed was that I added capers, which actually elevated the dish. I also think a little tomato paste would make it taste even better.

Loved it! I didn’t add cayenne because of my lil one sharing with us, but still super yummy! I tasted it as I went, and loved how it tasted without the sugar too. So next time I might omit the sugar as well, but it was delicious with it. Saving this recipe for sure.

I made this tonight. I didn’t think it was possible to make taco seasoning at home. I grew up thinking it only came in a package from the store. Wow was I in for a pleasant surprise! This recipe was better than ANY package from the store. The best part is I substituted Stevia for the sugar and it still turned out amazing. I used cabbage leaves as a taco instead of an actual taco, but it was awesome! Thanks for the recipe whoever you are.

I try to follow these recipes as they are,  otherwise how can you give an accurate review when you change half the recipe.  I thought this was delicious exactly as it is and will definitely be making this again. I brought leftovers to work for lunch but didn't get to it until 2 days later but it was just as good as when it was first made.

I didnt have any apple cider vinegar and so left that and the brown sugar out. I was very surprised how good it turned out. Also, I had a 40oz package of ground turkey and it was perfect. Not bland at all despite a much larger quantity of meat. Like they said, I could not tell I was eating turkey. It also didnt have the greasy taste that ground beef has. I made burritos and garnished it with chopped onion, cilantro, green salsa, sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. Definitely gonna save this recipe!  I recommend it.

will make it again. instead of onion and garlic powder, I diced and sauted 1/2 onion and 2 cloves garlic before adding Turkey. Spice was great. I served the meat in a sliced tomato with shredded cheese. Yummy.

Delicious flavor but way too much salt. And I was already using 16 oz turkey, not 12. I ended up having to curb the saltiness by adding some plain  cooked oatmeal to soften the salty flavor. It also helped to add some bulk to the taco meat. Next time I'd use only 1/4 tsp.  otherwise I will use this recipe again

This recipe has great flavor. It was VERY spicy, but I also added jalepenos from our garden, and I had to use chipotle powder since I didn't have any regular chili powder on hand. I also sautéed some diced onion along with the turkey and jalepenos, and added a splash of lime juice with the vinegar and brown sugar (only used 1 teaspoon of brown sugar instead of 1 & 1/2).

Not a fan, would not make again. 'Twas a wee sweet for my taste.  'Twas good until the bit about the brown sugar. To be quite honest i thought it was a bit nasty. Thank you for your time.

Pretty good! I added about 5 cloves of garlic and an onion prior to putting the ground turkey in and I loved it!  I had to substitute the cider vinegar with rice wine vinegar and it seemed to do the trick!  Ate this with rice and a sunny side up egg on top.

Pretty good recipe except next time I make it I think I will cut down on the salt. Other than that I liked the overall flavor. Not your typical taco meat but still good.

I was a little hesitant about the amount of spices used but I followed the recipe exactly - even down to the brown sugar & cider vinegar.  It was delicious...none of the bland taste typically found with ground turkey.  I served it with seasoned black beans, grated cheese, chopped onions, avocado, sour cream along with sour cream on the side.

I tried this based off the many positive reviews but beware - the reviewers that state that it is overpowering are very correct.  If you make this, cut back on the chili powder and cumin to balance the flavors better.   Famous Taco Seasoning Mix, on this website, is my favorite and I will not stray again.

Very flavorful for ground turkey!  I omitted the salt, oregano, and cayenne pepper.  I swapped out the onion powder for 2 tablespoons of dried chopped onion and added one 8-oz can of tomato sauce.

Delicious, but way too spicy!!! We love extremely spicy food and put hot sauce and jalapeños on just about everything. This recipe should come with a warning and glass of milk. This is one of the spiciest dishes we’ve ever eaten!

Loved! Super tasty, very easy, I had all ingredients in my pantry. I didn’t change a thing and it is definitely a do-over. Initially I thought it would be too spicy for my kids but after adding all ingredients for a big fat taco, it was perfect. My picky kids lapped it up. Different taste than your typical taco seasoning. I’m a fan.... thank you for the recipe!

This is our go-to turkey taco meat seasoning! It’s so easy to make and the ingredients are always in our pantry. We love it! I make the recipe without the cider vinegar and brown sugar and think it tastes perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!

I needed something quick & easy for a lunch taco salad.  This recipe was perfect--I had all the ingredients on hand.   My package of turkey was 16 oz vs 12 oz and I omitted the paprika as mine was old.  Came out great!

This was tasty! I did cut back on the spice and salt the second time around but it was very good. It is so much better with the juice of a lime added.

I used ground chuck b/c I was looking for a beef recipe when I found this one. But, I must say that this recipe with ground beef is really nasty tasting - very bad spice/flavoring combination apparently,
I thought about leaving out the dry mustard b/c it just didn’t seem to fit in a taco recipe and I probably should have left it out.  I also cut the cumin in half b/c I’m not a big fan of cumin, but probably should have left it out altogether too. I finally had to put two extra tablespoons of brown sugar and a couple dashes of seasoning salt into the mixture before I could deal with the bad taste the original mixture left in my mouth. And then, I could only eat half and put some tomato sauce and more chopped onion in the remainder to make hotdog chili out of it.
Would not advise using this  recipe to make taco meat of any kind - it’s nasty tasting!

This taco seasoning is so tasty!  I added chopped red peppers, onions, and sweet grape tomatoes for visual appeal.  Yum!

Left out the brown sugar (low carb) and it tastes amazing! Will make again. Also used 1 LB of turkey instead of just 12 oz -- perfectly spiced.

Hands down the best taco meat seasoning. The brown sugar and apple cider vinegar are important.

My husband didn’t even know it wasn’t beef! Excellent recipe! Thank you for sharing. Of course I also cooked 1 onion with it b/c we love onion (still used the onion powder).

Super flavorful and juicy tacos! I  sautéed some onions and added garlic before I added the turkey to brown. I served made mine on lettuce and added avocado and tomatoes on top. They were SO good! I will definitely make these again!

You cannot tell it isnt beef ! this recipe is insane for real i have no idea how it works but it does!! a staple for my recipe box ! cant wait to share this recipe with family and friends! I always up the garlic, and use smoked paprika ontop of the ingredient list for a nice spice. Also, i add dried onions (sometimes we just dont have enough time), and towards the end i add fresh chopped parsley to the pan as its shimmering for a nice pop of color. BEST TACO RECIPE EVER

Probably the best taco recipe I've ever made. I usually don't like adding sugar to my recipes, but decided to do it since I added the vinegar... I thought they probably needed to go together. And it didn't seem like too much. In the end, a really great blend... VERY VERY good. Kids loved it. BTW - I don't like turkey!

I didn't have any cider vinegar on hand and I opted out on the brown sugar.  I added drained diced stewed tomatoes instead of water. Yum!  I will be making this again.

Amazing!  Best spice mixture for tacos I've ever tried.  I half the sugar but keep everything the same. When I make the taco, sometimes I put quacamole, a little cilantro, sour cream, and a little squeeze of lime.  Heaven.

I was very nervous about making ground turkey taco meat but  I was very impressed with the flavor of this seasoning. The seasoning had just enough heat and i did not thing it was too sweet. New family favorite.

Cut back a bi on the cayenne if your chili powder is hot like mine.  Also added a table spoon of tomato paste.  As Taco salad meat this was a success

I always look at the pkg of pre-mixed to determine the ingredients but did not have the measurements. Thank you for this! I added some black beans to mine and instead of onion powder, I added some fresh chopped onion. Delicious! I'll never go back to the pre-pkg mix!

I didn’t make any changes. It was quite good.  We used it for tacos and taco salads. Great to keep in the refrigerator for a couple days. It was a little dry, but that’s expected with ground turkey.

I prefer my chili a little bit spicier, but you can make that to taste. This was so good and such a delicious comfort food!

Excellent, but I would decrease cayenne next time just because we love to add pickled jalapenos and Cholula hot sauce to taste on our tacos. Also, I simmered it a bit too long and it was drier than we like, but that was my bad. Will definitely make again. Saved to my favorites!

Definitely will make this again. Loved it. This will be my go to taco meat now. I added fresh squeezed lime juice at the end and instead of taco shells used lettuce wraps. I served with a side of pineapple and salad which made for nice flavor combination.

Good basic recipe. Flexible uses. My chili powder is way too mild or off, the only problem.

My whole family loved the tacos I made with this recipe.  I only added a dash of cumin, only because we don't prefer the flavor of cumin generally.  I also only added 1 tsp of brown sugar, and it was not too sweet at all - it was a perfect blend of flavors.

It was very spicy. But I like spice I added onions, pinto beans, diced chilis. Made it into a burrito. I could over eat this.

I made it with no changes and it was delicious! I was Leary of the brown sugar and cider vinegar but it really worked. Thanks for the recipe, I will make it again
