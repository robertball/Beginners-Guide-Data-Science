Well, it was tender and edible.  Made this dish exactly as the recipe says, and it smelled good while cooking, but otherwise, we found it very bland.  The meat had no taste, even though it was tender and juicy.  I'll not be making this again.

Is it me or shouldn't a Lemon Chicken recipe have lemon?! And what about seasonings like salt and pepper? I found this recipe to be rather lacking, even though I added all the above. I think the thyme just isn't enough of a spice to carry the dish. I won't be trying it again without altering significantly.

I added one table spoon of Less Sodium Soy Sauce and  1 1/2 tablespoon of Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce. I do not have the Lemon Cooking Wine, I used Holland House Red cooking wine plus 2 tablespoon of flesh lemon. I used fork to get the marinade into the chicken and marinate it overnight. I cook in skillet, taste wonderful. My family love it.

My family liked this chicken. I added lemon to the marinade and marinated the meat for 4-5 hours. I also discarded the marinade after putting the chicken on the grill.
