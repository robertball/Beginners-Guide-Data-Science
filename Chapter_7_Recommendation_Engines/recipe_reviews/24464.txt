I have a small dessert business & have made these cookies 6-7 times over the past few days for clients who wanted cookies for parties or to decorate with family.  After several batches, I made a few changes.  I increased the vanilla to 2 - 2 1/2 tsp & only used 1/4 to 1/2 tsp lemon extract.  I also reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Also, don't overmix the dough after adding the dry ingredients.  After making a batch, I usually refrigerate for 1-2 hours.  I also rolled the dough balls in sugar before flattening the cookies.  I baked the cookies for 8-9 minutes depending on the cookie sheet.  Clients went crazy over the cookies, especially those who like a crisper sugar cookie. Also, clients liked the reduced lemon & increased vanilla changes.  I use the Chewy Sugar Cookie recipe for clients who like a chewy cookie.  These cookies are great for decorating with frosting, cinnamon/sugar or colored sugars.

Very good recipe!  One thing I would be sure to add, though, is NOT to substitute shortening for butter, and to be certain to keep the butter cool enough to not melt it while mixing.  Without the emulsifying power of the lecithin in butter, you're basically going to have an oil slick on top of your wet ingredients, and nothing is really going to bring it back together.  Margarine probably works as a substitute, as it also has lecithin in it.  Some cookie recipes benefit from shortening or melted butter -- not this one!

These cookies are wonderful!  I first tasted them 27 years ago (1976) when my my Grandma Grace made some for us. My (then 6 years old) daughter loved them so much that they became a family tradition. They are crispy and light, and melt in your mouth good!! Keep them in an airtight container - if they last that long! : )  I've varied the flavorings over the years, too. Lemon, vanilla or almond.  All are great! Perfect for grandma's to keep in the freezer to bake when the grandkids come. I have rolled the balls and frozen them on a cookie sheet then bagged the balls for baking - just thaw on the cookie sheet - when you want just a few.  A wonderful cookie - but be careful, they are addictive!  Enjoy!

Very light with a slight lemon flavor.  I do not recommend this recipe for cookie cutters, the dough is to soft and airy.  But otherwise very tasty, didn't use a frosting, just put some white sugar on top.  This reciepe does make the amount specified.  I forgot to cut it down and ended up with 50 cookies!

Delicious cookies.  I made the full recipe, but baked only half.  The other half I flattened with the glass, then flash froze on wax paper lined cookie sheets.  Then put in bags.  Baked from frozen and they were great!

Excellent and easy.  I made these omitting the lemon extract--delicious!  I also used this recipe and included pecans and/or chocolate chips.  With the pecans, my husband said they tasted like the commercial Pecan Sandies Cookies.

Best sugar cookie recipe I've made.  Instead of lemon extract, I squeezed one half of a lemon into the dough and added a tad more vanilla as other users have suggested.  These really are great.  I am craving some as I type this...

mmmmm, very tasty.  Like others, I added a little extra sugar and didn't have lemon extract, so I added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and uppped the vanilla.  No frosting necessary.

These are wonderful home-type cookies.  They are a crisp cookie but melt in the mouth much like a good shortbread.  I loved the lemon flavor, and I think you could use some other flavorings successfully for some variety.  I used a small scoop, 1 1/4", instead of rolling into balls, then flattened the cookies as noted.  This made the process very easy.  Or, I think you could use the scoop and then drop in a bowl to roll in sugar which would really coat it with some pretty colors.  I got almost 6 dozen 2 1/2" cookies.  Reduce your baking time to 7 to 8 minutes.

These were great cookies although not being a sugar cookie fan it took a couple to convert me. Also they taste even better the 2nd day.  I did 1 teaspoon each of the extracts and the texture of the dough was perfect.  I wouldn't have minded more lemon flavor even but I was following the advice of the other reviewers.  My husband loved the cookies.  Also I did not have red sugar but as it is Christmas my husband decided to improvise and mixed some red food coloring with some white sugar and although it was wet & you had to kind of crumble it on like a topping, it turned out yummy.  I only chilled the dough for 30 minutes, wish I had had more time.  It did seem to be a very greasy dough when I was rolling the balls, probably due to the liquid crisco.  The presentation of the cookie was beautiful, they spread out just enough and looked like a bakery cookie to me.

These are very good and easy sugar cookies that melt in your mouth.  I left out the lemon extract and rather than dipping the bottom of a glass in sugar, I just rolled the balls in sugar ... then flattened them.

I have to say these are just the best sugar cookies I have tasted.  They are so simple to make also.  I made these for a gathering and several people commented and asked for the recipe stating that they were the best.  Thanks for sharing your cookies.

So yummy! I didn't have any lemon extract and I wanted to use cookie cutters so I added about a cup more flour. I also didn't have any cream of tatar, so I just used baking soda and baking powder. They turned out SO soft and fluffy and delicious! I think my oven is just super hot, I only baked for about 7 min! But AWESOME nonetheless! Definitely making these again!

An AWESOME cookie recipe--TEN STARS-- and very easy to convert for gluten-free.  I simply used a rice/potato/tapioca blend (such as Bette Hagman's recipe, which is: 2 parts white rice flour + 2/3 parts potato starch + 1/3 part tapioca flour).  As many gluten-free cooks know, you do have to add more flour to get a decent consistency, but if you add it an 1/8 cup at a time, I find it always comes out perfectly, once you get it to cookie-dough consistency.  I love these cookies after refrigerating the dough, then making dough-balls and dipping them into sugar before flattening and baking.  Make sure to put them onto parchment paper to avoid them sticking.  These are the best sugar cookies I've ever had--even when made gluten free!

All I can say is Awesome! Finally an excellent Sugar Cookie Recipe that does not require rolling, refrigerating, mess.  My son and I made these cookies yesterday and they turned out great. They were so easy to make and we couldn't stop eating them.  I did not add lemon extract since we aren't partial to lemon.  We made half of them with red & green sprinkles and half with granulated sugar and a little sprinkle of cinnamon. Thank you Angie, I will use this recipe every year.

I wasn't terribly impressed.  These were an awful lot like Snickerdoodles. And the oil was just way too much.  I ended up needing to add additional flour just to keep these from spreading everywhere.  But hubby and kids liked them.

I am a very experienced baker of 40+ years. I have been making this recipe for many years, but mine did not call for lemon extract, I only use vanilla & you can substiture margarine (make sure it is MARGARINE, a lot of them are now "Vegetable Spread" ) but if you do substitue, make sure they will be eaten within a day...best make with butter...I put my dough in a pastry bag & squeeze out in a mound & flatten with a glass dipped in suger, very fast...this is also excellent with added Holiday M&M's...always disappears at the school bake sales.....

I usually dread making sugar cookies for Christmas because they're so much work, but these were some of the easiest and tastiest sugar cookies ever.   Didn't have lemon extract, so I just put in about a tablespoon of lemon juice concentrate.  I also substituted a teaspoon of almond extract for the lemon in one batch which everyone seemed to like.  Very good.  I'll definitly be keeping this recipe for future use.

Sugar cookie perfection!  Delicious taste and so easy to make!  The only change I made was to switch the amounts for the vanilla and lemon extracts (1.5 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon).  I could eat a whole dozen of these, easy!

Absolutely amazing - I consider this the best cookie I have ever had! Makes lots, though and if you follow the directions, you'll have 4" diameter cookies. Next time I'll do a half batch and make the cookies smaller.

This is the recipe I have been looking for!  I have been searching for over 10 years to find a sugar cookie recipe like this one!  Perfect!  Not cakey, not dry, but light and crispy, melt in your mouth sugar cookies.  We ALL loved them.  No icing required!

I made these cookies today and my 4 year old and her little friend decorated them with can frosting and sprinkles.  They are very good and the description of light, crispy and tender fits them well.  I will make them again.  I found that it was easier to mash them down with a glass bottom when I put wax paper between the cookie and the glass - No sticking.  Thank you Angie.  Angela

I was very skeptical of these based on the cake-like batter, but they truly are amazing!!  Sweet enough; nice slight crispness with plenty of softness.  They're so good they don't even need frosting.  I was never confident making my own sugar cookies in the past...but I am now with this recipe!  I didn't have the lemon extract but I don't think they need it.  Mine turned out perfect; maybe some of the other reviewers baked too long? I only baked them for 9 minutes and put them on a cooling rack a minute after removing them from the oven.  I learned that trick when I first made snickerdoodles many years ago.  Hope this is helpful!

These cookies are so good! I've made them twice already and always popular. For Christmas, I used exra flour and rolled the dough flat and cut out christmas shapes and my brother put colored sprinkles on them. I've made them round too and either way they are delicious!

These cookies are the best!  I make these every year for Christmas....I substitute Almond extract for the lemon, and make a frosting with powdered sugar, milk and butter and add the almond extract to it too...De-Lish!

This is more like a shortbread cookie, but it's wonderful!  The lemon extract makes them very tasty.  I make really big cookies with this recipe and frost them with canned vanilla cake frosting that I've colored and heated in the microwave.  Then I add sprinkles.  They sold really well at my daughter's Girl Scout bake sale.  The kids go nuts for them, but the adults raved too!  Terrific recipe!

The rolled thickness of the dough makes a huge difference in the taste and texture of this cookie. The dough handles well and is easy to use. 
My family liked it rolled very thinly and cooked until golden.It has an almost shortbread taste but retains the sugar cookie crispness. This is an excellent recipe and has that full flavored old fashioned taste of my childhood. Perhaps my 4-H daughter will try this recipe at the county 4-H/FFA fair next summer and we will see if it wins a blue ribbon....we think it will. Thank you Angie for sharing this great tasting treat with us.

this recipe turned out good.  1/8th inch thick makes the cookies crunchy, but still surprisingly soft on the inside.  We'll probably make these again as one of an assortment for a holiday gathering.  Also, we resorted to squishing the cookies with our hands as using a glass consistently resulted in torn cookies.  Oh well. Thanks for the recipe!

I just had to say that these cookies turned out absolutely wonderful!  I did not have any lemon extract, so I added a little lemon juice and more vanilla.  I made my balls a little larger, so the cookies turned out HUGE!  If you like crispy sugar cookies, this is the recipe for you

These were very good. Took another reviews suggestions and added 2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp lemon. Tasted great, any more lemon would be too much i think.  These were VERY greasy though. I accidentally melted the butter instead of creamed it so maybe that was why???Either way I will definitely try again it tasted good even though i added more flour to combat the greasiness.

I didn't have any lemon extract so I used a splash of lemon juice and almond extract - then topped them off with an almond icing/glaze when they were cool. They were WONDERFUL and a really big hit! Not only am I going to make these again but I'm about to go and make a batch right now!

The dough has a wonderful flavor, however it is deceiving that the picture has what appears to be rolled out cookies. Rolling out the dough was a nightmare. It does not work very well to just add more flour- the dough crumbles. I used very fresh butter though so maybe this is the reason. Otherwise a good recipe, but three stars because it really made a situation for me to not be able to roll out the dough.

I used a Wilson holiday baking sheet instead of rolling them, and they came out perfectly!  The flavor was fantastic.   I didn't have any lemon extract, so I substituted extra vanilla instead.

These were so easy to make, light, and crispy.  I made a butter cream icing that I put on some and those became softer cookies for those who prefer them like that.  Not one cookie was left, they were refreshingly light.

Perfect! Crunchy bottoms, chewy inside.  I don't like to roll and cut cookies, and now I don't have to! These are pretty and delicious.    I used 2 sticks of butter (easier than cutting a softened stick in half) and 3/4 cup oil.  I took the advice of several other reviewers, and cut the lemon extract to 1 teaspoon.  Next time, I'll use the full amount. The lemon flavor is a little too discreet for my taste.  Another thing I did that was a little different than the directions was to dip the balls of dough into sugar, then flatten with a sugared glass.  No sticking, no tearing, and extra sugar!

WOW! These cookies are so easy & they taste great!  The lemon adds a little something extra.  I've never had good luck with sugar cookies, but these turned out perfectly.  My 5 year old daughter had a great time rolling up the dough & smashing it down with the glass :)  We used green & red sugar for Christmas.  So cute!

Let me just start by saying...I am not a big fan of sugar cookies.  These however are sooo good! I followed the recipe as stated but made a frosting to put on them instead of rolling them in sugar crystals.  They are the perfect texture & so easy to make. I've made them several times & will be making them for years to come!

A very good sugar cookie! With the advice of TLBRAN,  I increased the vanilla to 2 tsp & only used 1/2 tsp lemon extract. I chilled my dough, then scooped by tablespoons, and rolled them into balls, and flattened with my hand, then sprinkled with red and green sugar crystals.

Well, this seems to be a good recipe for those who like a crisper cookie.  It wasn't what I was looking for in a sugar cookie but I loved the lemon flavor.  They were very oily and my little girl had a hard time eating them because it kept falling apart.  Was a good tasting cookie but not what I would use for a sugar cookie.

OUTSTANDING cookies!! I also left out the cream of tartar (saved a trip to the store anyway) and used extra vanilla extract in place of the lemon extract (ditto on trip to store). Definitely follow the timing recommendations; remove them from the oven as soon as the edges start to turn golden brown. Absolutely divine... crispy and flavorful and so easy to make!

I have modified it by adding two cups of finely chopped Sun-Maid Tropical Trio (a mix of pineapple, mango, and papaya) and two cups of white chocolate baking chips. When we donate them to a bake sale we call them "Tropical Sugar Cookies".

This cookie is very moist, but holds its shape. It is also very good if you add nutmeg, cloves and allspice. This gives it a very spicy, rich flavor to an already wonderful cookie.

These are great!  I needed a sugar cookie recipe for my son's class Valentine's Day party,  and these are perfect.  I used orange extract instead of the lemon,  and everyone seems to like them.  Thanks!!

A wonderful crisp/chewey cookie.. great for gift packages--but because of the texture, these cookies do not make good cut outs.  Sprinkle with holiday sugar instead...NEW COOKS keep in mind--NEVER REPLACE BUTTER WITH MARGARINE>>> it changes the entire cookie.

If you're looking for a drop style sugar cookie like the bakery has...This is it!!  We Loved them! I also LOVE, LOVE, LOVE lemon, and made another batch with 3 tsp lemon extract and a little yellow food coloring for effect. Then i drizzled some lemon frosting on top.  Lemon perfection!  Great spring/summer cookie when you still want a "cookie" but chocolate is too heavy.  Wonderful!

This is the PERFECT sugar cookie and very close to what you find in the bakery. The have the texture of a shortbread cookie.They do spread a teeny bit when baked. Not too much so that they still retain the thicker size when squished with the glass.I used another teaspoon of vanilla instead of lemon. They were gobbled up before the nights end. I will look no more for another sugar cookie recipe. Thanks for sharing

Great tasting cookie - Made a mistake on the first batch and put them too close together, they spread a bit more than I expected.  Coated some with colored sugar and imbedded some mini-chocolate chips in others.  They were loved by all.

These were really great! I have an everlasting qeust to find the perfect sugar cookies, and this has come pretty close to being it. Straight from the oven they are soft, but after the cool they get harder and crispier. So, I took them out a little before they looked done since I like soft cookies. Also, the recipe calls for lemon extract,and because I am not wild about the lemon taste (just my preference)though they were still pretty good, I used 1/8 tsp almond extract. I think they might be even better without it, just vanilla extract. Thanks sp much!

All I gotta say is delicious these were so good and delicate i did notice they were a little greasy but i don't care they were so good i cooked for 10 min and broiled 2 min they came out perfect texture and browness the lemon was really worth it i only added 1 teaspoon trust me thats all it needs just to give it that little extra flavor also what i did was rolled the dough ball in sugar then flattened with the glass the whole cookie was crystalized i definetly reccomend these please try them they are sure to become a favorite cookie.

They were good, fun, and easy to make.  I would have to say that it was a bit lemony but they're still really good.  I made them pink and added yellow sugar, flower and pastel sprinkles, and pink and muti-colored ball sprinkles to make it look Easterish.

Makes a good lemon cookie, but sorry, too "lemony" for a sugar cookie. Also, I had to add another 1/2 c. flour to correct the consistency. If I were ever to use this recipe again, I would decrease the lemon extract by about half.

I thought these sugar cookies did taste good but I wouldn't say they are the best. I also noticed that after eating one my hand are very greasy, maybe the recipe calls for a little too much butter. I also didn't put as much salt or as much lemon extract as the recipe called for. Probably wouldn't use this recipe again.

Thank You!  These are wonderful.  The Cream of Tartar makes all the difference.  I didn't have lemon extract so I used a little Almond extract and the cookies were delicious.  I almost hated to frost them, they tasted so good plain!

These cookies turned out PERFECTLY!!! My family LoVeD them!!! The texture was slightly chewy and crisp on the outside and i am going to make them again!!! I will try to write another review to say what happens but i guarantee you now that these cookies ARE blue ribbon sugar cookies!!! I chose to do this recipe because it had some of the same ingredients my grandma's cookies have: cream of tarter, lemon, and it all works together to give you a fantastic result. Try mixing multicolored round sprinkles in this. They make colored dots and the cookies look great, also use only egg whites and add a little more sugar and OHHHHH, HEAVEN!!!

Excellent, Kids love eating them and helping to make them. I replaced cream of tarter and lemon flavor and with 1 Tbsp vanilla and they were sooo buttery and delicious (and easy!).  Thanks Angie for the recipe (but not the extra pounds).

This recipe is mine, but I'm going out on a limb to say they're the best sugar cookies I've ever had :)  They're not "chalky" like some sugar cookies, and they have a great lemony flavor. If you don't like lemon, you will not like these.

Just a quick point of update for those who find them too sticky to roll out...they are a drop cookie so they would definitely be too sticky to roll out. They are also a little delicate, especially if they are underdone. I never ship these guys, but I think they're worth handling with care.

Very light and tasty.  Used the suggestions from the first review.  Made them with the colored sugar, which was less time consuming than frosting.  They looked very good with the colored sugar.  Combined colors which was attractive.  Will try with frosting in the future.

I love sugar cookies, but my family did not enjoy these cookies.  I found them extremely 'touchy' to make, and they tasted burnt if just slightly overcooked (one side of pan done, the other side overcooked).  I found them 'dull,' Hubby says they taste like cooking oil.

This is a nice light cookie. I am not a fan of lemon so I substitute orange instead. Everyone always raves about them. Definatly a crowd pleaser. Good for kids to make too. Very kid friendly as they even frost well.

I just finished baking the 2nd of four trays of this recipe. We have all indulged in these straight off the pan and they are delicious! So far, this recipe is exactly what I was looking for in a sugar cookie recipe. One slight edit for my version was that I didn't have vegetable oil, so I melted butter flavor Crisco sticks and used these. I think its a winning substitution and am placing this recipe in the "keep and make these over and over" file. Buttery, soft, and a wonderful texture. I can't wait to see how they are the second day---if I can keep some around that long! I also only put in 1/2 tsp lemon extract and 2 tsp vanilla, knowing that I prefer a more vanilla centric sugar cookie.

The holidays are my baking season and I make these cookies for co-workers. They were a big hit and one of our experienced bakers asked for the recipe stating she had lost the tea cake recipe she loved. She said she couldn't wait for her next day off to make them. I thank you and my co-workers thank you. They couldn't keep their hands out of the cookie jar. This one is a keeper.

I've made these cookies about 5 times now- they are sooo good! I used more vanilla and less lemon extract. Becareful not to overcook.

nice cookie, I did cut down quite a bit on the lemon extract as I was looking for more of a vanilla flavor.  I'm not even sure I would use the lemon at all next time.

I don't know that I will ever bother trying another recipe for sugar cookies. I can shorten the time and come out with soft cookies or leave them in a minute extra and get them good and crunchy. Delicious.

My husband and his co-workers loved them. Finally a sugar cookie without a floury taste. Four stars because cannot use dough with cookie cutters. They are good though. This will probably be the only sugar cookie recipe I'll be using from now on.

I made this recipe tonight and it is awesome.  The cookies are to die for, so light and crispy.  My family loved them.  My son is stationed in England and this will be in a care package every month for him.  I did cut the recipe in half and used almond extract.  I also chilled my dough and rolled the ball on sugar before I flattened them.  It was so easy!  Thanks for this special recipe. It will be a Christmas tradition.

This was a very simple, quick, but delicious crispy sugar cookie.  I was trying to replicate the Voortman's Tea Ring cookie and this came very close.  Instead of using the lemon extract I used 2 t. of vanilla extract and 1/2 t. of almond extract.  Delish!!  I refrigerated the dough about 10 minutes between each batch and baked the cookies on parchment paper.  I used a small cookie scoop and dropped the dough into a bowl of sugar.  I patted them into balls and flattened with my fingers on the cookie sheets.  I sprinkled with additional sugar and baked for 8 minutes.  (4 minutes on each rack)  They came out PERFECT!  I took some to my mom and she ate 3 right away and said they were even better than Voortman's!  Great recipe!

Crispy and light and since you don't have to roll them out, they're also not as labor intensive as many sugar cookie recipes.  This is definitely a keeper.

I have made these 4 times in the past month- they always disappear in a flash. I use both almond and lemon extracts with vanilla, and a couple of the times have adjusted the butter up and the oil down for fluffier, rollable cookies. They are always yummy!!

I have made these several times and they are always devoured in no time.  I like to let the dough sit in the fridge for a bit, makes the cookies rise, they are even fluffier and thicker.  I cut them off of cylindrical tubes I make by rolling clumps of dough in wax paper.  The last time I made them with some Betty Crocker icing, strawberry and lemon. The strawberry sugar cookie was compared to a kids cereal, and was by far the most desired. :)

Thank You for the recipe, it is easy and delicious.

The oil saturated the recipe.  Cut it down to 3/4 of a cup and you should be good to go.  I also didn't use the lemon extract.  However, I wanted this recipe so that I could make ladybug cookies.  I added some black food coloring (Wilton's) in the recipe and my cookies came out black.  I decorated with half circles of red icing, smoothed out with a knife and used mini-chips for the spots.  Use the canned icing with tips for ease of use. These are the best tasting sugar cookies around!  Tip: Don't let your cookies cool too long on the pan because they break when you take them off.

I am not a big fan of sugar cookies but I made these for some friends and when they started to rave about them I had to try.
What a suprise.  They were delicious with a great lemon taste.
I recommend if you like sugar cookies and you like lemon this recipe is perfect.  If not a lemon fan use vanilla or almond extract instead.

These were wonderful!  Nice and crispy yet tender.  They taste better the next day for some reason.  I made them for Christmas and everyone loved them.  I originally tried this recipe to make cutout cookies, but this dough couldn't be rolled out.  The best way is as the recipe says, to roll in balls then flatten.  Excellent!!!!  Easy too!  (My first batch I halved to make only 24 cookies and it worked well)

Light, crisp? yes. Tender? no. I found these cookies to be so crisp and light that they were dry and sandy. A little strong on the lemon extract too. Not a winner for me.

These were excellent. They are so simple and good. My family and I have been snacking on them, my children love them. You can use all sorts of flavorings. I did use only 1t. lemon extract and 1 1/2t. of vanilla.

These are the best sugar cookies I ever tasted.  Most sugar cookie receipies taste like baked flour - these have a wonderful buttery taste with just a slight hint of lemon.  The only problem (which may be due to my lack of baking experience), is that the dough is hard to work with for cut-out cookies.  Otherwise they're A++.

I have to agree.. these are excellent.  I substituted orange extract for the lemon, and my boyfriend ate four cookies before he stopped to breathe again. Good thing I did not have to employ the Heimlich! I will definitely be making these for him again, since real love starts with a full tummy! :)

These cookies worked for the whole family.  My parents, who don't really have a sweet tooth, enjoyed the non-frosted ones, and my brother and I really liked the ones I spread with Sugar Cookie Frosting, also from allrecipes.  I found the dough really easy to work with and not too greasy.

This was a great recipe, except I felt they were too salty.  I cut back on the lemon to 1 tsp. and increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp.  After baking one sheet of these I added more suger to the dough to see how they would come out.  I'm surprised no one else commented on this, maybe it's just me.  Next time I will omit the salt all together.

I made these into cookie lolipops and gave them out as party favors for my son's birthday party.  They were perfect!  Not too sweet, not too bland.  Not too dry, not too tender.  I even caught several parents looking through the kids' party bags for cookies to steal!

These were quick and easy, and DELICIOUS!  I am not fond of lemony flavored sugar cookies so added extra vanilla and left out the lemon extract.  Thanks for the great recipe Angie.

Thank you for the wonderful sugar cookie recipe.  They were easy (mixed, baked and put away in an hour) and they tasted better than any sugar cookie I've made.  I dipped a cup in red sugar and pressed each ball.  They looked great for Valentine's Day.

An Absolutely fantastic tasting cookie! I didn't change a thing about the recipe, it's perfect! They are light,buttery, with a delicious lemon taste! I used the "Decorator's Frosting" submitted by:P.Oakes and then covered them with sprinkles. My son helped me make them and it was unbelievably fun and easy! They start off a little crisp and then work their way into a softer, "tender" texture. However you like your Sugar Cookies this recipe is guaranteed to please!

I made these cookies so my God-daughter could cut them out, and when they were done, they were so good I ate them all myself, without even icing them.  Best recipe for sugar cookies I have ever tried.

This was the first time I've ever made sugar cookies and they turned out perfectly!  I was told, "they are so good, they taste like they are from a professional bakery."  Thanks for the recipe.  This one is a keeper!

We made these and then decorated them with the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe.  They came out great and were super easy to make.  I actually made the dough back in October and then froze it.  We then used it to make Christmas cookies!  You'd never know that the dough was frozen for 6 weeks!  I will definitely make again.

Super light and surprisingly delicious cookies. My two young boys said these cookies were better than chocolate chip cookies. The first batch disappeared in two days.

The BEST!  I never rate anything, until now.  This recipe is easy, and produces a tender and great tasting cookie!  My 11 year old daughter made these herself easily!  We substituted almond extract for the lemon extract and they were still really, really good.  This is my new go to sugar cookie recipe!

The key with these cookies is ALWAYS use a COOL pan when baking. They're less likely to spread.

I gave this 3 stars because the lemon flavor was bit too much. The cookie was a nice texture, although a bit oily from the vegetable oil. I was a bit surprised to see that ingredient, as I have never made a cookie with vegetable oil before which is why I thought I would try it. But I think I will stick with all butter recipes the next time. It almost tasted store bought with that oily flavor. All in all its a tasty cookie, but maybe it should be called Lemon sugar cookies instead.

The taste was very good, but too crumbled too easy. I would try to pick one up and it would just break into pieces, this is after they cooled also.

Results in light and crispy cookie.  Not for cutouts.  Followed another reviewers advice and used 2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp lemon extract.  Kid's like these better than sugar cookie cutouts.  We've coated in cinnamon & sugar and got rave reviews.   That version is especially tasty with coffee.

These cookies were a hit in my Christmas cookie trays this year. I followed the recipe exactly, using red and green sugar for decoration. They were simple, basic and delicious! I will be making some dough to keep in the freezer for "cookie occasions" throughout the year.

Love it, love it, love it!
I did not have any lemon extract so I used almond.  The dough was too soft to roll into balls but I used a cookie scoop and they came out perfect!  I was looking for a sugar cookie recipe that you didn't have to refrigerate and roll out and cut out.  This is the one!

Found this recipe just yesterday and tried last night with my two children.  Fun and easy to make, my children enjoyed flattening and decorating, and they are a huge hit. Love the results!  Now, if they only will last until Christmas.  All evening my children said "mommy, may I just have one more?"  Great recipe - will make again and again for sure!

I normally don't like sugar cookies, but these have a YUMMY chewy/crispy texture, instead of the usual crunchy yuckiness. And I love the lemon extract in it!

This is a very good, quick and easy recipe. I just finished baking (and tasting) a batch.  I followed the directions 100%. I had the recipe reduced to half the amount and it's a good thing I did because I would eat way to many.  This is a keeper!

well I hate to say this but... these cookies did not go over well at all, in fact ended up feeding some to the birds. Followed the recipe as stated, but the cookies were very dry.

Way too much lemon.  Makes a killer lemon cookie though.  I didn't sift the flour and dry ingrediants, so maybe that's why I didn't have the 'too cake like' complaint some other people had.  I added about a half of cup more sugar though.  I didn't find the mixture too doughy either, although I wasn't trying to cut them out; I flattened them with a glass as suggested and made them very big (a little larger than golf ball sized).  Next time I'll use 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract and 2 teaspoons of vanilla and I think they'll be the best sugar cookie I've ever had.

I made these cookies as a drop cookie. It was light and crunchy yet soft in the middle. However I did not care for the flavor, but I think I will make them for christmas when my kids and I make our sugar cookies with frosting. I think they will be great then.

Great cookies. It took way less times than stated to make these. about 25 minutes from start to finish... with a 2 year old. ALthough I DO have a Kitchenaid and I think that this reduces prep time by a lot. Anyway, these cookies were fabulously easy and delicious. But next time I'd do 1/2 a recipe. I didn't look at the yeild before I started.

These cookies were great!! We didn't use the cream of tartar and we used half of the lemon recipe, but it still turned out really well. This is our favorite cookie recipe. Thanks Angie, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This recipe made the best sugar cookies.  At first I was skeptical because of its consistancy but they cooked perfectly.  I hope everyone tries this one it will be a favorite of ours for a long time.

This is the best sugar cookie I have ever eaten.  The texture is incredible.  Starts light and crispy and then melts in your mouth.  There goes my diet...
I did not have cream of tartar so I left it out and only used 1 teaspoon of lemon extract, like some other people advised.  Cooking time is critical.  If underdone or overdone, the cookie loses it's great texture.  Easily five stars!!  Thank you! Even my fiance loves these and he (normally) wont eat anything but chocolate for desert.

A really easy recipe and the flavour was great too.  My only caution is the consistancy of the dough.  I found it really soft, and tricky to work with.  I didn't have lemon extract, so I just added extra vanilla. The cookie is very light, with a nice mild flavour.

GREAT COOKIE!! This recipe is excellent! I didn't change anything. Made them twice already and they turned out great both times. I don't like to cut out cookies, so I just scooped them out with a medium cookie scoop (about 1 1/2 in.) Perfectly crisp on the outside, tender on the inside. This one will definitely be my only sugar cookie recipe from now on!

Absolutly wonderful cookies.  I dont know what the reviewer who gave this one star did wrong to the recipie!  They are flaky and light.  don't worry if the dough is a little soft, just handle them gingerly.  I will cut the lemon extract by 1/2 teaspoon next time.  They are delightful!

Very good.  I like softer cookies so baked barely 9 minutes.  Just till a light gold around the edges.  I didn't have any lemon extract so I doubled the vanilla.  Still wonderful.  Will be using in holiday gift boxes.  Thank you.

Awesome recipe!!! I couldn't even wait for the first batch to cool before I had poured myself a glass of milk and ate 3 of these delicious cookies. The name says it all. I didn't use the lemon extract, though I am sure thae added flavor must be amazing. I rolled out balls of dough between my hands and flattened them with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. The edges cracked giving them a flowered look. I already made a second batch and shared the recipe with my sister in law.

Add these cookies to the Christmas tins!!

What a terrific recipe! I was looking for a mint sugar cookie recipe so I modified this one easily by adding Mint Extract instead of Lemon, baking them as drop cookies then adding a colored "melty mint" to the middle. My mint-loving step daughter went crazy over them.

I love these cookies - actually everyone who tries these loves them. They are ADDICTIVE! I've never had a batch last more than a day and a half. The recipe is very versital which I love, and is super easy - makes it easy to make with kids.

I thought these cookies were a bit to floury for my taste. But my kids sure did have a blast decorating them. And the cookies held up really well. They didn't break up like some do.

One of the best sugar cookie recipes I ever tried.  The lemon extract added a nice touch. It's nice not having to roll out the cookie dough.
I used red, white & blue sprinkles for the 4th of July party I was bringing these to and they almost didn't make it to the party!  They were a hit.

These cookies are very good. I really like how crispy and delicate they are. Also, good lemon flavor. I like not having to roll them out. I did have to put in the freezer for about thirty minutes to get the dough stiff enough to roll into the balls. Otherwise, this is a very good recipe and I will make again. I mae them yesterday and they are nearly gone tonight.

I tried using this recipe for cut out cookies and it didn't work.  The dough is far too sticky.  I even tried adding up to 4 cups of flour and it still wouldn't roll out.  I ended up rolling bite size Snickers in the middle of each cookie and they turned out pretty good.  The extra flour made them really fluffy.

yum delicious. I eggnogged these! I subbed rum for the lemon and bumped it up a bit and added cinnamon and nutmeg to dough. Then I made frosting, where I used eggnog instead of milk, added some nutmeg and sprinkled with cinnamon. The cookies came out great. but the icing I made was too sweet/much so I think an eggnog glaze would be better.   Will  make these again

Great, light cookie. Instead of dipping glass in sugar, I used a small piece of parchment between glass and dough. Worked out beautifully.

This was my first attempt!  I had the ingredients and gave it a try!  The compliments keep coming in.  GO FOR IT!  The 1 1/2t. of lemon extract was the perfect measure for the subtle lemon flavoring.

It has an okay taste, but after baking the first batch for 22 minutes (note 3 minutes LESS than how long they say to bake it for) the cookies were practically entirely brown, extremely crunchy, and smelled burnt. Likely will not make again.

I made these cookies following the recipe exactly.  These were for an order for sugar cookies, however, I think all the vegetable oil gave the cookies an off flavor.   The lady who ordered them swore they were snickerdoodles and wanted a refund.    I won't be using this recipe for sugar cookies again.

I did not make any changes. The taste of oil was too strong.  I think I'd use less oil and more butter next time. Other than that, I liked them. I made them with my 3 1/2 year old niece. She said, "I love them"!

Great recipe.  The dough was a big wet so it was difficult to use cookie cutters on without augmenting some extra flour when rolling out, but it didn't affect their overall taste and texture.  They also expand quite a bit so if you are using cookie cutters, make sure you roll the dough really thin (maybe 1/8 inch max).  Other than that, they were great.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Absolutely delicious sugar cookies!  Made per recipe with one change per reviews; reduced lemon extract to 1 tsp. and increased vanilla extract. The hint of lemon is what makes this sugar cookie soooo goooood.

We were hoping to use cookie cutters and make some lovely holiday cookies the kids could decorate.  After trying to roll them out for cutting a few times  with no success I read some of the other reviews.  Yup - not good for cookie cutters.  We rolled them into balls and used the bottom of a crystal champagne flute to imbed a nice imprint. They came out nice and tasty.  We also used almond flavoring instead of lemon - kids choice!

I'm always sceptic when I find a recipe online so I tried this one after looking at all of the reviews. And I have to say I love this recipe.  I always add extra vanilla just in case when I don't have any extract and it turns out great. Everyone loves them and so far I have made them for a quince, 2 birthdays, and just for the heck of it. =)

These sugar cookies are a tradition at our house. We make them every year and they are always a hit on the cookie tray. Just to make things easier, I use 1 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of oil. Also, when I want a true sugar cookie, I up the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons and omit the lemon. But sometimes I want a lemon sugar cookie, so then I will add it in as written along with some zest from a fresh lemon, then when cool, I drizzle with a lemon glaze! - yummy!! These cookies are easy to make, fun to decorate and delicious to eat. What's not to love about them?? :)

These sugar cookies have great flavor, but be sure to make the balls of cookie dough VERY small. Also, if you flatten them too much, they will turn out like pancakes.  I didn't use any lemon, only vanilla, and I think they still tasted great.They are very crispy.  I personally would prefer these with frosting. 
Very tasty!!!!!

Very good recipe. I rolled dough balls in white sugar before flattening on cookie sheet. The cookies turned out perfect and looked very uniform because of flattening with the bottom of a glass.

These were delicious!!  I only made a couple of slight changes because I didn't want to use vegetable oil.  I upped the butter to 1 cup and used 3/4 cup of coconut oil and increased the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons and omitted the lemon extract.  Wow!  Delicious with a hint of coconut!! Got rave reviews from family and friends!! They baked up beautifully!!

We've made this recipe several times! We dip the unbaked cookies in colored sugars (that we make ourselves) and they bake flat and come out all funky colored! Huge hit with everyone, especially the kids!

Texture is ok, flavor isn't bad, over all its kinda a middle of the road cookie. I probably won't make this recipe again. It's rather salty and the lemon is a bit overwhelming. My son doesn't like them.

Awesome sugar cookie recipe. I didn't have lemon extract so I used orange extract . The flavor of these cookies is great! I used it as the crust for my fruit pizza so I cooked it until light brown so it would be crispy not soft. I used a cream cheese frosting which is the best flavor with the fruit toppings. A big hit!

These cookies came out very yummy. I used almond extract instead of lemon though, because I didn't have lemon extract at home. But the change made it taste better to us:)

Man, these were a huge hit. My family of three snarfed the whole batch down in about two days. The first batch was a little thin, so I adjusted the thickness of the rest of the batches, and the rest turned out perfectly. I was not able to get the sugar to adhere to the bottom of the glass, so I just sprinkled a little sugar on top of each cookie after smashing them down. I used Shiny Cookie Icing, a recipe available on allrecipes, and it was a perfect match. I see no reason to deviate from this recipe of cookie perfection, so I will have it available every Christmas going forward.

These were so good!  I replaced half the vegetable oil with coconut oil because I didn't have enough veg oil and it was such a good substitute!  There was the perfect hint of coconut flavor that made these cookies.

I followed the advice given of using 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract and 2 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla. Also put the dough in the refrigerator for 1 1/2 hours. I still had a hard time with the dough sticking to the glass when I was flattening the cookies.

I usually prefer a softer sugar cookie, but these were very tasty.  My hubby and I liked them best while they were hot, straight out of the oven.  I took some of these to my parents and my dad loved them.  He said that they reminded him of Lorna Doone shortbread cookies.

Very good!  I was a little scared because of the oil and butter, but they turned out great.  Very light and tender.  Not too sweet.  I didn't have lemon extract, so as another poster suggested, I added 1T lemon juice.  They were delicious.  Will definitely use again.

These are pretty good cookies! No complaints about them, but I've had better.  I didn't have any lemon extract, so I used orange. I also added some orange extract to my icing.  I will very likely make these again, but this will not be my only sugar cookie recipe.

One word describes this recipe....FABULOUS!!! Not only is it easy to make but it also satisfies the taste buds.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoy cookies.
