This was very tasty. It was nice and thick and very sweet, in a good way. I couldn't really taste the cucumber, but typically can't taste a little celery or carrot added to a smoothie either. I made a 1/2 recipe which yielded 1 serving and not 2. For 1/2 the recipe I did 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries, 1 small frozen sliced banana, 1/4 cup sliced English cucumber. I didn't bother to peel it. It doesn't have a tough skin, 1/4 cup of Trader Joes Greek nonfat vanilla bean yogurt, 1/4 cup of water, and 1 ice cube. I blended in my Vitamix blender about 30 seconds on speed 10 and 20 or so seconds on high. Just needed to tamper it a bit. Calories came to 175, as typed above, and using 1 small banana. I will make this again. TY

This smoothie went down easy, but I wouldn't say I really enjoyed it. For me, it needs to be sweeter. Maybe my banana wasn't ripe enough? If I make it again I will probably add more banana, maybe some strawberries, and see if that helps.

I was happy with how this turned out. I didn't have any cucumber so I used strawberries instead, I thought it still tasted really good. It was a nice treat to have after a long day at the beach

I was very hesitant about the cucumber in this smoothie, but it's just barely detectable and actually gives it a really fresh taste. I can see making this on a really hot day to cool off...it's that refreshing. Since the calorie count is so low, I actually drank 2 servings (cutting the recipe in half for just me).

When I was making a smoothie I realize I didn't have any bananas so I used one cup of frozen strawberries instead of a banana. I also added one Hersheys chocolate bar blended it altogether and it was great. I suggest using have a small cucumber too much cucumber it can make a wonderful smoothie, we'll lets say not so wonderful!

I will definitely make this smoothie again. The ingredients are every day ingredients that I always have in the house! Everyone who tried it loved it! I didn't peel the cucumber, causing it to taste a lot like cucumber (which was actually VERY refreshing).

Loved this smoothie! It turned out a little thick (I had Greek yogurt) so I used it as a base for a smoothie bowl and topped it with fresh mangoes and strawberries!

HAd this smoothie this morning.  It was pretty good, but I thought the cucumber flavor was a bit heavy, which really surprised me.  I thought it would be heavily a blueberry flavor.
Don't think I'll make this mix again.

I enjoyed this smoothie. The first time I made it, I think I had too much cucumber as the taste was overpowering. The second time I made it, I didn't use cucumber, nor crushed ice- liked it better. However, I don't think the amounts are correct based on the serving size. I really only got maybe two servings from it (I can't imagine that the cucumber and crushed ice would make up for that). Still, I recommend it.

You just have to be aware that if you let it set too long, the yogurt rises and it is very thick. A quick stir or shake  shall make it easier to drink.
