I made this for dinner tonight.  I made a few cooking changes, but followed the recipe as created.  I live in Michigan, Christmas Eve is not the best night of the year to grill anything.  So instead, I put together the marinade, and place the meat and the marinade in a bag and placed in the refrigerator for several hours.  Placed on a roasting pan, coated w/non stick cooking spray, and roasted at 350* for until internal temp reached 170 ~ about 2 hours.  I made some additional marinade and basted twice during the roasting time.  This seared the meat nicely and kept it moist and juicy.  Everyone raved over it and agreed that it needs to be made again next year for our dinner.  What a perfectly wonderful recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing with us.

Yummy! I didn't want to do it on the grill so I just put in a roasting pan. It does take 1-1/2 to 2 hours to get to the right temp. I made up the sauce and glazed the meat with some of it and then heated the sauce before serving and served the meat with it. It was delicious.

This was soo yummy.  A different twist that the whole family enjoyed.  I mix up the ingredients and marinated my tenderloin in that for a few hours..then I grilled and basted with additional sauce I made and it stuck to the meat so nicely.  What a great flavor.  Without marinating and basting often..I'm afraid the delicious flavor wouldnt be as prominent.  Will make again for sure!

It was too cold to grill when I made this, so I roasted my tenderloins at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes then glazed them for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Delicious!  The Italian seasoning provides a nice contrast to the sweet fruity BBQ sauce mixture.

My husband said my best pork tenderloin to date.  I didn't have blackberry, so I used grape jelly instead.  Marinated it for an hour before baking it in the oven at 350 for 1.5 hours.  delish!

My husband fixed this pork tenderloin recipe for Christmas dinner and it was a hit all around.  Even our grandchildren loved it.  however I didn't care for the barbeque sauce he used, it had to smoky of a flavor for my taste.  Next time we will use a different barbeque sauce.

I am a big fan of blackberry so I had to try this.    I really liked the flavor but wish it had more flavor in the pork.  I marinated it for about 3 hours but plan to marinate longer next time so that the flavor will be bolder next time.      Great idea!  Will repeat!

This was wonderful!! Absolutely delish! I grilled it on a Cuisenart electric grill since it's still cold out, but that worked fine. It was moist and juicy and the sauce added plenty of flavor. Not-so-easily impressed hubby loved it. :) 
Only reason i give it 4 stars is because I thought the sugar-free jam wasn't so good. I actually bought it by accident, then saw that the recipe called for it and just went with it. I thought the barbeque sauce and meat would overpower the flavor of Splenda, but it didn't. Some people are used to it and don't mind it but not me. An easy fix, though! 
Also the sauce is not a marinade. A lot of people try marinading in the sauce and the reason it doesn't work is because it's... a sauce. If you want to marinate the meat, put it in a sweet brine or a soy-based marinade. Just a suggestion. :)

I didn't have access to a grill so I can't say if grilling would have changed the flavor. I marinated this for nearly two days and barely any flavor was infused into the pork. That part was disappointing.  I did save some of the sauce and served it with the pork. When served with the sauce, this was yummy. Without the sauce, not so much...

I am going to give this recipe a 4. I altered it too much to know how the actual recipe turns out but this was a GREAT dinner. I love cooking but i have been in a slump lately. This recipe sparked that fire again and i am so thankful for that! 

Here are my alterations.

It was too cold in Ohio to grill so I marinaded my pork in italian seasoning/dressing for 35 minutes. I cooked it for about 45 minutes on 350 in a greased roasting pan. I dumped the marinade in the roasting pan with the pork so it would have some extra time to infuse the flavor.

while it was roasting i took the blackberry jam and my homemade chipotle bbq sauce and put it in a sauce pan and brought to a boil. i reduced the heat, addded a few pinches of cocoa powder, 1 tsp honey mustard and let reduce for 30 minutes. For the last 5 minutes of the cook time on the pork i basted the loin with the blackberry sauce. 

I added fresh apple slices to the blackberry reduction.

Let the pork rest for 5 minutes, sliced on the diagonal and drizzled with the blackberry reduction and top each plate with an apple slice.

This was AMAZING!!! I'm having my parents over for dinner tonight and this is what I am making. I am serving it with a garlic and white wine orzo dish!

This was very good. We added a chipotle pepper to the sauce for a little zing, and baked it in the oven. Very tasty, thanks for sharing your recipe- we will make this again!

Very bland.  I marinated overnight and it still had no flavor.  Perhaps if you just use the sauce to dip the meat in it wouldn't be too bad.

I have made this twice. The two first times I made it in a roasting pan in the oven. Kids devoured it.. no leftovers!  Doing on the grill tonight hoping it is just as awesome!
