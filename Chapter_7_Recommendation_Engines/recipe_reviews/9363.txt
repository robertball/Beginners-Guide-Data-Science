Fantastic!!! This recipe came out great.  I used a honey dijon mustard and added the Worcestershire sauce to the mustard before spreading it on the leg. I also added parsley, rosemary, and garlic powder under the mustard.  Even my family members who said they do not like lamb, loved this recipe.  Plus it was SO easy. Thanks!

This was very good, but I did make some changes.  For mustard I used a sweet hot mustard. It worked very well.  It gave some of the heat of mustard with out overwhelming the taste of the lamb. I skipped the flour.  Instead of just laying garlic slices on it, I cut pockets into the lamb and put the garlic slices in there.  I also added a bit of Rosemary, Basil and Thyme.  Not a lot, just enough to add a hint of herb flavor.    I also added the herbs and mustard and everything about an hour before cooking so it would have some time to soak into the meat.  My husband loved it, as did I.

this was my first time making lamb and this was an easy recipe that was very good. I used a 6 lbs leg and used only as much mustard as was needed to cover the leg completely. I also used garlic powder when I used the salt and pepper. Yummy.

I loved this recipe, but I also altered it a bit. I added all ingredients minus the flour and plus 1 T. lemon juice and 1 T. white wine and mixed a paste to spread on lamb. I lined the pan with sliced carrots and potatoes. I started the lamb at 425* for first 25 minutes.

I found some sweet classic dijon and loved it so much I added a lot more than was called for here. It was a hit. Very easy to make, delicious and satisfying.

A Friend of mine did this and it was Fabulous!! She used Dijon & Wooster, then smeared it with crushed garlic -- she forgot about the flour, it was so yummy!!

I used a boneless butterflied leg of lamb for this instead of a whole leg and it turned out great and cooked much faster, about 15 minutes/lb.  CHANGES: We love garlic so in addition to the fresh cloves, I mixed in garlic powder with the flour to add extra flavor.  Used dijon mustard instead of prepared.  Added several "dashes" of Worcestershire sauce. GRAVY TIP:  I added about 1/2 c of water to the roasting pan about 15 minutes before the roast was done. It will slowly cook with the flour and juices already in the pan, so that when the roast is done you can just sieve the remaining liquid and get a really great "jus" to serve over the lamb.  Served with roasted lemon potatoes and tomato salad.  Will make again.

I thought this was fabulous! I used dijon and mixed about 1/2 t of the Worcestershire into it. Didn't flour, as I'm low-carb and it still made a lovely sauce after the addition of cream at the end.

Very. very good.  This was a hit for Christmas dinner!  I also had a butterflied boneless leg of lamb.  I put regular yellow mustard on one side and dijon on the other.  I made slits in the meat and stuck pieces of fresh garlic in.  I did the dusting of flour . . .it made a beautiful coating.  Everyone loved it.

This is so good.  I changed it a bit.  I first rubbed with salt and pepper.  The after combining dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, olive oil and fresh garlic, rubbed the lamb and let it marinate on the counter for about 2 hours.  Then baked.  Awesome.

Good flavor, but couldn't taste the mustard at all on the lamb after cooking.  Next time I'll just use more, or stronger mustard.

We normally make our lamb with a Greek Marinade and wanted a change.  My teenagers were a little skeptical at first, but ended up loving it.  My roast was only about 6 lbs. and I should have adjusted the mustard a little, but we really did enjoy the flavors!

This is by far the best leg of lamb I've had, outstanding.   I thought it used too much mustard, so I went a little light on it.  Could have used it all.  I have told many people about this recipe.  We raise and sell lamb at markets and this recipe is a keeper.  I think this would work well on pork loin too.   I followed the advise of another review and added garlic in the leg and some extra herbs, not too much, just enough.

I had a 7 lb leg of lamb.  I salt & peppered the leg, rubbed Worcestershire sauce then rubbed a generous amount of powdered mustard all over the leg.  I roasted it fat side up It was my first time cooking and eating lamb.  It browned beautifully and the mustard crust was delicious.  It was a bit hit!

To add more flavor and seasoning, I injected the leg of lamb with a garlic creole marinade, cut slits in it and stuffed it with garlic and refrigerated it over night. I followed the preheat setting and roasted the lamb for about  2.5 hours.  I then basted it and reduced the heat to 275 and slow cooked it for almost 3 hours.  It was fork tender and juicy with great flavor.  I never used the mustard and worcestershire sauce.

We used an entire bulb of crushed garlic, just because we could.  Made tiny slits all over and pushed the garlic into the meat.  Also added fresh rosemary, plus dried thyme and sage to the mustard before brushing on meat.  It was cooked perfectly and deliciously tender.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It tasted awesome. We pared down to 3 pounds because that is all we could buy and the cooking time was way off. We used a meat thermometer cooked to 165. Next time I would do 160.

The garlic adds amazing flavor.  I used fresh rosemary, chopped it, and mixed it with sea salt, black pepper and olive oil, then rubbed that on just before putting it in the oven.

It was excellent.  I used a combination of  bold'n'spicy and classic mustard - about 50/50.  Everyone enjoyed and I made stew with the leftover meat.

Used yellow and brown mustards, and added a little honey. Crushed the garlic into the mustard and mixed in the Worcestershire as well as small amounts of rosemary and marojam before spreading onto the lamb. Delicious!
