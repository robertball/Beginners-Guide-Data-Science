I'm not a huge fan of asian cuisine but my boyfriend and his mom are so I made it for them, and surprise, I liked it too!! I used apple cider vinegar instead of white and brown sugar instead of splenda.  I halved the liquids since I wasnt cooking as much chicken, but then forgot to halve the seasonings- so only 3/4 cup vinegar and 1/4 cup soy sauce, but still used full amounts of red pepper etc, but it still came out AMAZING and extremely flavorful! I did have to add about another 1/4 cup of brown sugar to tone down the tang of the vinegar (so 3/4c brn sug, 3/4c vinegar, 1/4c soy sauce). Also used baby portabellos which I already had instead of button mushrooms. Served with white rice, will try adding chopped carrots next time for more color.

I love finding recipes when I have all the ingredients in the house. Very easy, step by step to make, and everyone really liked it. I used an electric frying pan and used broccoli instead of peas.

The product was satisfactory;however, I am inclined
to revise the recipe to reflect no more than 3/4 cup of vinegar and to change the sweetner to granulated white sugar of about 1 cup. You can mix the vinegar, soysauce and sugar together and the sugar will dissolve without heating. Other than that the recipe is intriguing and has plenty of upside. I purchased spring rolls to be added as an accoutrement.

Little too sweet and tart, Try half


 the vinegar and sugar and add 1 cup chicken stock. The first time I made it by recipe about half my guest would'nt eat it. The second time w/ changes everyone wanted seconds.

Made this recipe for my family earlier this week and they loved it. I made some modifications, which includes using 1/2 cup of regular sugar, adding real garlic (yes in addition to the garlic powder), used baby bella mushrooms and different types of vegetables. 
This was an easy dish to make and made plenty of sauce that went well with rice.

Made the recipe and the flavors were great.  I would have liked the consistency to be less liquidy, so next time will hold back on the vinegar (3/4 instead) and work from that...will definitely try again soon.

Made it for my wife, whose favorite foods are spicy, sweet and tangy. She really liked it and has asked to add this to my "list." I added broccoli and yellow bell pepper and similar to other reviews, the veggies really just cooked down. Could barely tell there were mushrooms in there.

I liked the sauce on this a lot, but the veggies really just cook down.   My kids liked the chicken in it.

Delicious! Even my picky teen loved this meal. The only change I made was that I used granulated sugar instead of Splenda. Will certainly make this again.

This was very good, however next time I would cut the red pepper flakes in half.  A little too spicy for my family's taste.

OUTSTANDING!!!  I have tried quite a few recipes I found online, and other than Giada's turkey recipe, this is by far the best!!!  I made it last night -- with just a couple of minor adjustments.  I only used 1/8 tsp. of red pepper flakes (I'm a sissy), and I cut down a little on the vinegar and Splenda.  I also added some chicken broth.  After it was all done, I added cooked thin spaghetti and stirred.   EXCELLENT !!!!  I want to make this recipe again tonight!!
