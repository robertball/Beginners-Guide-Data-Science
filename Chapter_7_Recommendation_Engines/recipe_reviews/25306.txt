I've made this twice now.  This first time it was good, but too spicy!  The second time I used mild italian sausage, cut the italian seasoning in 1/2, used just a pinch of crushed pepper, used a whole bell pepper & onion and added 1/2 to 1 Tablespoon of regualr sugar (still used brown & confection as well).  It was soooooooo good!  Probably the best spaghetti sauce I've ever had.  Hard for me to say, cuz Spaghetti has been my favorite since I was a kid!  You'll love the waves of sweet and spice... Enjoy!!

Very very awesome sauce.  Really unique with it's sweet and spicy taste.  I made it last week and my boyfriend said he is craving more. I used 5 roma tomatoes instead of 4 and simmered it for 4 hours or so. For the last 20 minutes I added meatballs. the family loved it and says i now make the best spagetti sauce they ever tasted. If you don't like overly thick sauce add a little bit of water.  Will definitely make again.

This sauce is definitely unique.  It wasn't bad, but it had such a strong flavor from one of the spices, it was hard to eat too much of it.  I think it was the allspice, had a strong clove taste to it.  I followed the recipe exactly except used mild Italian sausage.  I would try this again, but cutting down on some of the over powering spices, and adding some garlic. If you're looking to wake up your taste buds, this sauce is for you!

This spaghetti sauce is fabulous.  I didn't add the confectioner's sugar since the sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy after adding the brown sugar.  From now on, this will be the only spaghetti sauce served in my home.

OMG, this is fabulous--just like my Sicilian step-grandpa used to make.  All my life I've been looking for a recipe that lives up to his sauce--and this is it! I used Newman's organic marinara instead of the tomatoes/paste, and more red (& green) peppers. Now THIS tastes authentic!

Sorry, but it just wasn't good.  The consistency was very thick--looked like someone had left it on the stove for 10 hours and the liquid had evaporated, even though my daughter followed the recipe to a "T".  The closest description I can come up with is that it tasted like someone had mixed up a stuffing recipe with their sauce recipe and this was a result.  Guess to our family, sage, thyme, marjoram, etc. are for stuffings and poultry instead of Italian sauce.

This sauce ended up tasting exactly like a brand name sauce, which was not what I expected.  The sauce itself tasted very good, but was too sweet for our palate.  As I said before, it comes off tasting like it came from a jar.  We prefer more traditional, rustic marinaras.

This is one of the best spaghetti sauces that I have ever made as I have never been a real fan of make-it-myself sauces.  I really never found one that I was crazy about until this one.  The closest I get to homemade is to buy the Spatini packages at the store.  While this recipe is time consuming and probably better made on the weekend if you are one of those busy working moms like I am, it really came out great, especially if you are a person that likes spicy food! (my family loves spicy:)  The only change that I made to the recipe was to add some water to thin it somewhat.  We tend to like thinner sauces and this one is most definitely thick!  It smells wonderful while it is cooking and will certainly become one of my recipe box recipes:)

Great sauce!  Everybody loved the mix of spices.  I will absolutely make it again, but I will probably change the amount of the sugars to 2/3 of what the original recipe calls for.

Anytime you are adding tomatoes to a sauce, be sure and check for their sweetness.  Some tomatoes have more sweetness and others are more bitter.  Sugar is normally added to counteract the bitterness that tomatoes sometimes have.  So, again, depending on the sweetness of your canned or fresh tomatoes is how you should add the sugar, and also to your own taste.

Great Sauce.  I only added red wine didn't have any white on hand, added extra garlic like another suggeated. I left out the rosemary (allergy) let it simmer or about an hour and half. My 5yo loved it ate 3 helpings even my hubby who is not a big pasta fan enjoyed it.

I didn't have enough red wine for my normal sauce, so I used this as a base to make a different sauce. Very good. It felt like it was missing something, so I added a pinch of cinnamon and some sugar. Great!

Too Sweet,too thick, and too many different flavor combinations going on. Bought a lot of extra spices and wines that I wouldn't normally buy just to make this recipe.

I've made this twice, both with ground beef and it is fantastic! I used to use a bunch of spices in my sauce, but lately have been sticking to the basics.  One of these days I'll get around to making it with the spicy sausage!

This recipe is very tasty, bold and spicy, you will definitely need a good bottle of Chianti or some other red wine. Will keep this one on top til something beats it. Delish!!

This was one of the most fabulous sauces I've ever tasted-thanks Jeremy! I've made it several times trying both the ground beef and the spicy italian sausage for friends and family alike and it's always a big hit-whichever version.  The only modification I do is to use fresh garlic and more green pepper and mushrooms.  Definetly a keeper!

oddly sweet and a muddy flavour from the spice mixture fighting with itself.

Hard to imagine that crushed tomatoes, garlic, basil. black pepper and bit of red wine isn't going to be a much happier combination - if necessary do some mushrooms and onions in a bit of olive oil (boiling them in wine is going to make them slimey) if that's what you'd like and a touch of oregano.

It was good but it had a little too much herbs in it for me. It had a sweet and spicy taste too it. I used didn't use the hot sausage because of my kids and cut back on the hot pepper seeds.  I probably won't make this again.
