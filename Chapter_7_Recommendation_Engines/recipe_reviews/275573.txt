This was so incredible and delicious! My parents raved over the flavors! We were all equally impressed by how tasty the cauliflower pizza crust was!

I didn’t think I’d like this. I used caulipower and I was surprised my kids and husband tried it and thought it was pretty good. I don’t think they’ll give up regular pizza but at least sometimes, they will let me make this!!

I wasn't sure my husband would eat a pizza out of cauliflower. However, the pizza disappeared in minutes. He loved it.  The CAULIPOWER crust was not soggy. The crust was crispy and cheesy. I  did cut the sausage thin and the fresh mozzarella thin.

This was a great recipe, my family and I truly enjoyed it and the best part was that my kids never knew the crust was made from cauliflower.

I made this when we had a friend come over that has a gluten allergy and I was looking for gluten-free pizza crust. I saw the CAULIPOWER frozen crust and decided to give it a try using this recipe. I was a bit hesitant to try a cauliflower crust so imagine my surprise when it baked beautifully. It was light and crispy and with the cheesy toppings and flavors no one could tell it was cauliflower, not even my picky children who can spot anything remotely good for you a mile away.

This was delicious-tasting! I was hesitant on the tomatoes but my sons and I all enjoyed this. They loved how cheesy it was. Neither had any idea it was made with a CAULIPOWER crust. The fact that it is gluten-free is another perk, as we can prepare it for when a close friend of mine visits. Thanks for the great recipe!

What could be better than a tasty, cheesy pizza?  I used my homemade pesto and plum tomatoes from my garden.  I chose to use Johnsonville sweet sausage as a personal preference.  I'm impressed with the gluten-free alternative CAULIPOWER crust which  held up to the flavors and remained crisp.

We loved this crispy and delicious tasting Margherita pizza built on the CAULIPOWER crust.  I actually made two of these pizzas, because the first one tasted so good.  I used half of and Asiago Chicken sausage thinly sliced. I also used pre-sliced mozzarella, but found that I need to slice them thinner to ensure they melted into a nice cheesy pool.  This pizza was was simple to make yet the ingredients combined to make this taste like a gourmet pie!

Delicious combination of ingredients, on a better-for-you, thin and crispy CAULIPOWER crust! I didn’t find the exact sausage, but used an Italian smoked chicken sausage that was delicious with the other toppings.

This pizza using the CAULIPOWER crust was absolutely amazing. First, you could not tell it was gluten-free or made with cauliflower!! The crust was crispy, and the recipe was delicious and cheesy. Very happy with how this turned out and I think we've just found our new go-to pizza crust!
