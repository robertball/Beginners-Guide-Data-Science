I made the recipe as written with the addition of the optional sugar. I love that this drink become frothy once blended but it is overall lacking flavor. In my opinion it is a bit too milky and I would likely use 3/4 orange juice and 1/4 milk next time.

I used Sunny D and skipped the additional sugar as Sunny D is sweet enough. Kids said the flavor was good but they did not like the ice as it seperated from the liquid and floated to the top. This is possibly because I have a horrible blender.

I made this drink this morning and actually like this recipe. What I did instead of adding the optional sugar was just using honey instead. I think it's not too orange and not too much milk flavored, so the flavor was very subtle. If one cuts back on the milk as 3/4 cup and uses the 1.25 cup of orange juice it's still good. Thanks for sharing!

Very good smoothie but the orange is overpowering so I added 1 tbsp of vanilla extract and was perfect. A little too liquidy for my liking.

I was really disappointed with this smoothie. It had too much milk which made it very flavorless. There's a better one on this site, with better proportions - Easy Orange Creme Slush.

Made as directed.  It was okay but not that great.  I will try it again with cream to see if that will give the cremesicle  taste.

5.24.16   I accidentally only used 1/2 cup of skim milk (instead of 1 cup), found the OJ flavor dominating, then added a little vanilla.  Think this also might be good with a little almond extract.  Probably would have been better with more milk, but I still liked it and will make again.  And I also like that this is a low-cal smoothie (many aren't).  Garnished with orange zest.
