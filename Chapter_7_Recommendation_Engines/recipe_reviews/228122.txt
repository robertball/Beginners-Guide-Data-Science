Very, very good.  I didn't use 5 large potatoes, since there are only two of us, but did use all the sauce.  They were delicious, creamy, and smelled great while baking.  I love recipes that take a long time in the oven just for the ease and terrific aromas.  Thanks for a keeper!!

These aren't your mothers scalloped potatoes!  I will definately make them more often!  I only changed a couple of small things.  I carmalized the onions and added the garlic to them as they cooked.   I also added porkchops as a Layer in the potatos and used a dutch oven instead of a cassarole.    When I was ready to crisp the top I added a layer of shredded cheder cheese.

These were pretty well received.  Everyone gladly ate them and would have gone back for seconds if there had been any leftover.

I was skeptical but I had heard about using mayo and stock instead of milk and this worked great. I prefer a little more salt and pepper but that is my taste and I can't find a fault with this alternative to the cream/milk versions we're all used to having.

My only warning is be very prudent about the mayo and butter usage. It doesn't take a lot extra to make the result a little fatty looking.

I have been looking for the recipe under Scalloped Potatoes and Onions as was originally submitted by Taste of Home's Fast Family Favorites.  This is duplicated and the garlic, poultry seasoning, parsley, black pepper and chives have been added to the original recipe created by the above mentioned.  The original recipe is awesome without these added ingredients I thought as did my family.

Amazing recipe!  My family couldn't stop raving about it when I made it for a family gathering. We used white potatoes with the skin left on and they added an extra creamy, melt in your mouth texture.  Left garlic out due to sensitivities to it in our family, but didn't lose any flavor at all.  Also baked it with a layer of shredded cheese on top, just until the cheese started to crisp.  Definitely making this my go to recipe for Scalloped Potatoes from now on.  Would also make a good main casserole dish if you added shredded chicken or pork.

I made these potatoes last night for dinner they were in one word fantastic.I followed the recipe amounts as written with the exception of adding a layer of sliced onions in the middle of the potatoes as well as adding some chopped onion to the butter while it was melting before adding the flour . Had to have a generous layer of cheese to top it off too . This will be the only way I will make scalloped potatoes from now on :) Thankyou for this awesome recipe !

I was looking for a scalloped potato recipe that was not cream or milk based and I really love this! It came out tasty and the sauce was creamy and delicious- I had to taste some before I put everything in the oven to bake. The only thing I did differently was use red potatoes and leave the skin on- it turns out really pretty that way with the red and the green chives.

I tried this recipe last night and loved it. So did my husband. I used one less potato than called for, only one clove of garlic and substitued the mayo with Miracle Whip as it's all I had in my fridge. It didn't take as long to cook as the recipe indicated - about 1.5 hours in total and I put my oven on broil for the last 10 minutes to really turn it golden brown. Will definitely make it again... great comfort food.

Very good. Please note the "low sodium chicken broth" or reduce/omit the salt. I made the mistake of using regular broth, (loaded with sodium) and the result was almost too salty. That was my fault, not the recipe. We really enjoyed this recipe and I will definately make again. Topping with cheddar cheese and bacon is good too. Thanks!

Always had a problem with scalloped potatoes and the "separation" factor. Tried this recipe and it turned out fantastic. Used red potatoes and sautéed my onions before baking, but otherwise followed the exact recipe. Hubby and I loved it. Our toddlers asked for seconds...and thirds!

These are delicious!!  I was afraid they would taste strange without any cheese so I added a handful of shredded cheddar but they didn't need it.  Will definitely make again and again!  Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I read some people added cheese, I did not. I was happy to find a recipe without it to cut back on the fat.  Didn't miss the cheese at all.  These were delicious and creamy as is.  I fried up a serving for breakfast the next morning.

The first time I made this as written with the exception of substituting beef broth for the chicken broth since that was all I had at the time. No complaints. I have made them twice with beef broth since. I also have used red potatoes and red onions since the first time I made this recipe  and this dish was still delicious.

This was a wonderful, creamy dish.  I was looking for something that did NOT have cheese or milk.  The sauce in this recipe is delicate and so tasty you don't miss the extra fat of the cheese. I will make this over and over again.

This was great! Took it to a potluck dinner and it disappeared fast! I was in a hurry so I microwaved the potatoes and onions to get them started. I used fresh parsley and sage. Easy and really good!

I gave this three stars. I prepared it ahead, and it was easy to prepare, but it was both bland and odd tasting at the same time. The poultry seasoning gave it a really strange aftertaste and was the only flavor that stood out - couldn't even taste the garlic.

Made this at an altitude of 9500 feet. Next time I will double the white sauce since things dry up at this altitude, and this was very dry. Tasty, but dry.

This was excellent! I followed the recipe ingredients exactly. I only thing I did difference was in the prep. I cubed the potatoes and browned the onions and garlic first for some caramelization.  I served it at a potluck and everyone loved it.

Wouldn't say that these were my favorite scalloped potatoes, but we still enjoyed them.  I sliced the potatoes in the food processor, and if I were to make again, I think I'd slice them a little thicker and also slice the onions rather than chopping.  Two hours in the oven is a long time on a scorching hot summer day.  The length of time it takes to cook this dish is one thing that I don't like about it, regardless of what time of year it is.

Great alternative to cheesy potatoes, which I'm not fond of.  To cut down the cooking time, I parboiled the potatoes and sautéed the onions in a little butter; they only needed 30 minutes in the oven that way.  I only used three potatoes since there were just two of us, but didn't reduce the sauce.  They were amazing.   I normally eat one portion of food, but went back until they were all gone…three times!  They do have a bit of a sweet taste, especially if you keep going back for more.  In the future I think I will replace the mayo with sour cream and see how that turns out.

Made this tonight, and the whole family loved it. I don't like mayo so I substituted it out for cream cheese and add a bit of heavy cream for good measure. I also subbed out the chives for scallions. Creamy goodness!

In the past I've not had great success with scalloped potatoes. I used four large potatoes instead of five as I was concerned they would be too dry considering the ratio of potatoes and sauce.  The only other change was that I used my trusty freeze dried chives instead of fresh.  This dish turned out fabulous and worthy of serving at a formal dinner get together.

This was tasty! Everyone, kids included, ate everything. I omitted the poultry seasoning, however.

I sliced the potatoes and kept them in cold water the night before.  Mixed and added the sauce just before cooking the next day.  The flavor was delicious, but I didn't care for the color (looked grayish to me).  Will probably top it with cheese when I make it again.

Made this for our Christmas dinner. I used 5 large potatoes and it was two to many. It's and easy recipe to prepare and make. I used the mandolin to slice the potato.  I also sautéed the o ion and garlic together before layering. I did make extra sauce and I'm glad because it wouldn't have been enough otherwise. I also increased the spices because it seemed a tad bland for our tastebuds but didn't add salt due to the broth. I also added shredded cheese to the tops the last 20'. These turned out so soft and really good. But one pan fed 8 people and I have the other pan left. I would make these again. I loved that it didn't use cream but was still creamy. Thanks for the recipe.

These potatoes were the best no milk scalloped potatoes ever.  The only thing I changed was used less flour.  Highly recommended for those who cannot eat dairy.

This recipe was just ok and a little bland for the amount of effort it requires. I used 5 medium/large yellow potatoes and there was not enough sauce for our taste. The potatoes also came out a little too mushy/soft, so I think the cook time was too long.

I made this for supper this evening and it was very good. The only thing I did differently is omit the poultry seasoning. (just for personal tastes of family) I will be making this again!

Very good. I only used 2 potatoes and baked it in an 8x8 pan and cut the sauce in half. I didn't have chives so I used scallions and fresh parsley. I cooked it for about 2 hours then broiled it for 5 minutes or so to give it a nice color. I also grated some Asiago cheese on the top. It was really good

Delicious side dish for Easter dinner!  The only issue I encountered was the "5 large potatoes."  I could only fit 3 large potatoes in the 2.5 qt dish.  I figure that the large potatoes I chose were actually extra-large.

Made this last night after reading many reviews. I took advice from other reviewers and customized the dish for my family. I carmalized 2 onions along with the garlic (thanks GEOMASON) and layered in the potatoes.  I didn't use low sodium chicken stock so I omitted the salt.  During the last 15 minutes of baking, I uncovered the dish, sprinkled the top generously with shredded cheddar cheese then garlic croutons.  My family loved it! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the grayish color. I didn't think it was all that appealing.  Anyone have any suggestions to brighten up this great tasting dish?

OH MY!  I made this last night exactly according to direction.  (except I didn't have any chives).  I was so creamy, so delicious.  My husband said he may explode from eating so much, and I couldn't stop either.  Wow is this good.  I'll reheat the leftovers tonight(only the two of us)and I'll bet it will be awesome too.  It stays really really hot so allow some cooling time before you indulge in this wonderful dish.

This recipe was great! I let out the poultry seasoning b/c I didnt have any. everything else was done exactly to recipe! I don't think it needed to be cooked quite as long b/c the potatoes were a tab mushy and I like them a little firm. But other than that, it was great! The green onions on top made the dish for me. I almost skipped them and I'm glad I didn't!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I'm up in the middle of the night and cannot sleep, so I decided I'd use up some potatoes and onions and make this recipe.  Just tried it and it is delicious and easy to follow. I like it because it utilizes common ingredients anyone would have on hand.  Can't wait till my mom wakes up and tries some. :)

My lactose intolerant husband loved these along with his family. I made these for the in laws and my father-in-law (who only eats to survive) couldn't get enough. These were a big hit and were easy on my family's digestion. I was a little worried about the mayo because no one likes it at my house, but it was a big hit defiantly worth the time they take. I did not change the recipe at all, which is rare.  I will be adding this to my recipe rotation for sure.

Super good and so easy to make! What a great way to make an economical side dish with things I usually have in my cupboard.  I followed the recipe exactly, but sliced my potatoes extra thin with a mandoline. I cooked at 325F for an hour and half, but believe the dish would have been ready in just an hour since my slices were so thin. Thanks!

great flavor I think this is a 4 1/2 star! hardly believe there isn't milk or cheese. doesn't even need it. can be slightly oily, so don't do more butter or mayo than called for.

I was pleasantly surprised at how creamy these potatoes turned out.

I did add a cup of heavy cream and some sharp cheddar cheese, as well as finely chopped fresh oregano. I also bulked up the rest of the seasonings a bit, and sprinkled smoked paprika on top.

Smelled, looked, and tasted great!

My wife has many dietary restrictions (FODMAP) so we're always looking for dishes she can eat that everyone likes. I used garlic oil instead of fresh garlic, green onions and organic broth. I also used some shredded mozzarella & cheddar. It  was very good and I'll definitely make it  again.

This is an amazing recipe! I was looking for a potato casserole base for a Spanish-style dinner that could cook while I was finishing work. With the layered potatoes and onions, I layered refried beans and (leftover) taco meat. I substituted chili powder for poultry seasoning and sprinkled cheese and green onions on top. I put it together the night before. My husband popped it in the oven while I was at work and when I got home, I prepped a salad to go with it. Rich and delicious!

I missed the instructions to keep the foil on at first so they were a little brown but delicious!  I added Parmesan cheese on top before baking

Soooo Good! Only change I made was add thyme and rosemary since I don't use poultry seasoning  and used mushroom broth instead
 (I'm vegetarian) and it turned out perfect!  Definitely making this for my family again,  they loved it just from smelling the aroma during baking. It got two thumbs at the table...thank you for sharing

I substituted 1 tsp fresh parsley for the dried.  I also increased the chopped onion to approximately  1.5 cups because that's how much half an onion worked out to be.

I made these for a family dinner as my grandson-in-law is lactose intolerant so couldn’t serve regular scalloped potatoes. They were surprisingly good, and my granddaughter even asked for the recipe. There were no leftovers for me to take home either.

awesome. Next time, I might make it in a wider dish to get more crispy topping. 15 min was not enough to crisp the top, so I broiled it to a golden brown. This is a keeper recipe.

I added shredded nacho cheese between the layers of potatoes and I did not have poultry seasoning so I used Spike vegetable seasoning.  My hubby loved it and I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe only adding salt and pepper to each layer.  The potatoes were good, but they were missing a little something.  I may make this again, but I’ll add cheese!

Excellent dairy-free Scalloped Potatoes recipe.  I added some chopped ham and probably used more herbs than indicated. I will make it again. It will be good with or without the ham. I am thinking about if there is anything else that I might want to use the sauce on.

So I followed this pretty darn close, as I had to make 1.5 times the amount for a big Easter brunch.  Not sure if I messed up my calculations or what, but it had way too much onion for our taste.  It super over powered the potatoes.  I also thought the herb flavor from the poultry seasoning was too strong.  So I'm not sure I would make this again.  I'm willing to say I could have messed up, but I was trying pretty hard to do it right, as I didn't want to disappoint 12 people for my brunch.  Everyone ate it, but I got zero compliments and nobody had seconds.  So, that's pretty much a fail.

This is a very tasty recipe and very easy to make. I doubled the recipe..The sauce was a perfect consistency. The only I might do next time is add cheese to the top and crisp it before taking out of oven. There were no leftovers!

We enjoyed the flavour of these very much. Since I am not able to consume dairy, it was a delicious alternative to the traditional. The baking time was too long, and ours came out over-cooked therefore, next time I will give them a test around 1 hour 10 mins, considering there is additional baking time without the foil. There will definitely be a next time. Thanks!

I made this exactly as written—no added cheese.  It was basically tasteless. I was trying for a less-rich version and ended with less taste.

Very good. I used half an onion, large clove of garlic, and cooked them in the butter before adding flour, broth, mayo and pepper. I also added some thyme and rosemary, and omitted the poultry seasoning as I didn’t have it on hand.  I pre-cooked the potatoes a bit to make them softer per personal preference and kept the assembled dish in the fridge and put it in the oven for about half an hour. It was a hit.

My review got cut off.  Even though I was so looking forward to these, I thought that they were terrible.  I followed the recipe to a T and I just didn't like them. Even with all of the yummy seasoning I thought that they were pretty tasteless. Will find another recipe.

This dish was delicious as a part of our Easter ham dinner.  I did caramelize the onions in the butter, & added the chopped garlic for the final minute or two.  I then proceeded to make the sauce .with the flour, etc.  I adjusted the recipe for 10 servings and it nicely filled a 9x13 baking dish.  I sprinkled shredded cheese on top during the final few minutes.   I was leery of trying a new recipe on our dinner guests, but thankfully they all wanted seconds!

By far the best scalloped potatoes that I've ever had!!! I did however add 2 1/2 cups of shredded cheese and a 1/2 cup of bacon bits to the top after baked and then the chives. I will definitely be making this again!

Really liked it.  Just added more salt/pepper - was a tad bland for me. Will make again. No leftovers!

I think I may have goofed. I needed to make a larger quantity so I added more ingredients and added additional flour. The sauce wound up sitting on top of the potatoes instead of flowing down through them. The potatoes were tender, and the sauce had good flavor, so next time I'll use less flour and hope that does the trick. I'll definitely try this receipe again!

I used cornstarch instead of flour so I had to add the cornstarch to the broth and mix before adding to the butter. I also added another cup of broth and 4 oz of Gouda. Delicious!!!

I made this vegan by using Better than Boullion no chicken base, Just Mayo, and olive oil. It was fabulous!
I did use  rosemary, sage and thyme for the poultry seasoning because those are my favorites

Scallop potatoes better than mom used to make, certainly a different twist on them but for the better!  I like to add Parmesan cheese to brown them the last 20 minutes of baking-if we have any left overs they are even better the next day.

I used a dairy free butter substitute. It was wonderful to have scalloped potatoes again. I didn't miss the cream at all! Very flavorful and rich.

These were AMAZING!! The whole family loves them and I loved that they relied on chicken broth and seasonings for their flavor rather than heavy cream and cheese.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I made no changes except I topped with panko after removing foil.

My family loved it, however I would put some of the sauce in between the layers as it did not seep down into the layers like I'd hoped.  But the flavor and smell were amazing.

OHH YEAHH!! Been looking for a substitute for cheesy versions, not a fan, this TOPS all lists! Didn't have poultry seasoning so I used 1/8 tsp fresh chopped rosemary, couple leaves of sage (torn into small pieces), and 1/8 tsp dried thyme. My only mistake, I used sea salt and didn't cut back, still Scrumptious!! The ONLY scalloped potatoes I will EVER make!! Keep in mind, even using the low sodium ckn broth, the mayo and butter provide significant salt. THANK YOU!!

I love that this recipe isn't loaded with cheese, butter, and cream yet is still has the same rich taste! I recommend using 4 potatoes versus 5, otherwise you can not have enough sauce. I would absolutely make this recipe again!

This recipe is amazing everyone including my very picky 2 year old loves it! What I like besides the amazing flavour is that this recipe does not use dairy, so no milk, I however, did add some  grated parmesan to the sauce and topped my with cheddar for that classic scalloped potato look. I also sautéed my onions and herbs in the butter instead of adding them in after the flour. I have made this recipe twice now. The second time around I substituted the potatoes with breadfruit as it is locally grown where I live. This herbed sauce tastes and looks a lot like a Campbell's cream soup so I will be making this sauce for recipes that call for a cream soup. Again, delicious, easy, quick. Also, I used a gluten free flour mix instead of the flour and that did not affect the quality at all

I thought that these potatoes were just ok. They didn't have a lot of flavor (although I did leave out the poultry seasoning). They didn't look appetizing either, because the sauce was the same color as the potatoes so there was no color besides white-ish. And then because of all the cooking time, the potatoes were a little mushier than I would've liked. Not worth all the work.

These were great!  They did took a while to make, but I loved that they were in the oven and ready to go a couple of hours before company arrived.  I carmelized the onions beforehand as another writer recommended.  Deelish!

These were delicious!  It's amazing what the addition of a few herbs and some mayo does for plain scalloped potatoes.  Great for leftovers, too.

Lacking something, too onion-y, and too much cooking time.

This was really good. I needed a dairy-free recipe of scalloped potatoes and this did the trick! I followed the recipe exactly although sprinkled some crumbled feta on top just before serving. Everyone loved it!

It was edible, seemed to lack flavor, my family considered this boring. So we had tons of left overs and just dumped chedder cheese all over it the next night and heated it up. I think we even ended up throwing it away.

Yum! I followed most of this recipe except for the garlic powder and poultry seasoning. I don't like garlic in potatoes and the poultry seasoning didn't sound good to me. It was easy to make and put together. For my own tastes, I think it could have baked about ten minutes less. Regardless, the flavor was awesome. I was hesitant about the chicken stock (vs. milk), but it imparted a really good flavor to the potatoes. They were a hit as part of Christmas dinner! I will definitely make these again - but first I have to finish off the leftovers.

Everyone dining at my home on Christmas loved this!  Didn't have poultry seasoning in my pantry closet, but used Sazon Goya Sin Achiote instead.  I will be making this again!  TY

Very very yummy. Made the recipe smaller since only two people, but this recipe is so very good. Will make it again and again
