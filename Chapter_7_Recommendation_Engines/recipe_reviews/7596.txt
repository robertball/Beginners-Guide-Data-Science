This recipe is very good and correct. If you, as other reviewers, can not make this, try something simpler first, like boiling water.

This was luscious. I doubled it (except the gelatin; I left that the same) and used it to layer and top a yellow cake with sliced strawberries. The gelatin kept the cream from going weepy, and was stiff enough for a nice thick layer of strawberries and cream in the middle of my cake.

This recipe didn't make very much at all.  It also does not smooth out on the cake,

I have this same recipe but I use 1tbsp white sugar, its not sweet but only to give some taste to your already sweet cake or pie. You may want to add more sugar if you want it sweetened.. I admit its a tricky recipe. Before you start :You need to cool the bowl that you are going to use for the whip cream and the beaters for at least 15mins before using them. (I usually put mine in the freezer). In another small bowl;Sprinkle gelatin over water, mix and let it soften for 5 mins.( I microwave mine for almost 1 and half maybe 2 minutes total and I stir it every 30 to 60 seconds)..but not too hot as to a hot bubbly boiling because it will harden when it cools..only till it the liquid looks clear. let it stand room temperature and not too warm when you add it to the heavy cream.. use immediately. I have used it for shell borders, stars and basket weave, for decorations on cakes. It doesn't fall apart like the average whipped cream.. its not a smooth frosting but I think it depends on the long you cook the gel. I hope this helps. :-)

I am not a beginner when it comes to baking or making frosting or icing, but apparently I have no clue how to use gelatin.  I ended up picking out the gelatin chunks and frosted my cake with the whipped cream.  Like others have suggested, there should be some clarification on how to do the gelatin for those of us who have never used it.  The gelatin was nice and smooth and after whipping it  into the cream it was just stringy and didn't blend.  I'm sure it is my fault, but I can't find one recipe online that explains how to do this properly.

The quantities worked very well for me. I didn't follow the instructions completely as written - I bloomined the gelatin in a small bowl, then stuck it in the microwave for about 8 seconds (it had set, so I just needed it to liquify). Then I beat it in to the whipped cream. Since this was a filling for a cake roll, I also incorporated about 1T passion fruit puree. Worked like a charm!

This recipe did not give quite enough info on what to expect regarding the speed needed to handle the gelatin; I doubled it for a layer cake. Except for the gelatin, it turned out ok, but had to pick out the chunks of the gelatin.

Really good as is, but it doesn't make much. I prefer to do the same as other reviewers and double everything except the gelatine. This way you not only get more, but the consistency is a bit lighter.

I attempted to make this and it came out tasting great, however the instructions could use a bit more detailed info about the gelatin. I did as was directed and the gelatin turned into strings in the whipped cream mixture. it stood well though!!!!! no weeping!!!!

This recipe definitely needs a little clarification.  I had to do the gelatin twice in order to get it right!  Mine still didn't look as nice as that in the photo!

Gelatin clumped when added to the cream mixture. Had to pick out the clumps and then was left with just whipped cream. Not what I wanted at all.

I'm not very experienced with gelatin so each time I made hot it didn't workout , but when I added while mixing the others it turned out fine. Still wasn't what I was looking for.

I'm a decent baker, I know how to make whipped cream, I have a Kitchenaid and I STILL had problems with this. Instructions are not clear. Even following recommendation, my first batch of gelatin turned into boogers before I could use it. Tried again microwave method. Added t a thin stream but still ended up w globs on the bottom of my wisk attachment, so I'm not sure how much gelatin actually made it in there. There were some strings. Flavor was ok, needed a touch more sugar. It is NOT a smooth frosting, but worked on a Banana Cream Pie which was what I was looking for. It piped ok as a border. I hope we don't find globs when eating it, what I tried was ok.
