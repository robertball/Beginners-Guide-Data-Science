I've been searching for a good clam dip recipe that didn't have that preservative flavor like the ones you buy. This was absolutely delicious! Let this chill several hours before making any changes, it tastes great as is after being chilled.

This is a super recipe, however I added 2 tablespoons of Kraft mayo, a few dashes of parsley flakes and deleted the hot pepper sauce.  Everyone loved it!!! It was gone in minutes! My son who is four really liked it too! A++++++!

This same recipe has been in our family for years.  However, we add more drops of worcestershire than the recipe calls for, and more drops of Tobasco.  Our recipe says a few drops, to taste.  We probably use 5 drops tobasco and 8 drops of worcestershire.  Wonderful for summer afternoons, especially if you're at the beach!

My oldest son and I made this together and after we finished, we decided that it needed more clams. He added one more can without juice. We did use reduced fat cream cheese. We snacked on this at lunch with broccoli pieces, carrot "chips" and celery. The kids and I really liked it.

Clam dip is loved by my family.  Whipping the cream cheese first makes for a nice consistency.  We ad a half cup of sour cream, a tsp. of celery salt and omit the tobasco.

This is just the recipe I was looking for.  The other flavors don't overpower the clam flavor.  I served it with Fritos and it was great!

Pretty good, but not great.  I have made this and tried out all sorts of variations.  So far the best I've found is to definitely add Worcestershire sauce.  Let your wild side come out.  Try a few fresh herbs.  Add and taste.  Then add more… I tried a combination of fresh garlic chives…onion chives, and also some parsley.  Add the lemon juice, a few drops at a time until you get the taste you want.   I don’t remember the exact amounts, but that’s how you can make cooking fun.  I also use yogurt to stretch the batch if need be.  Plus it helps to blend all those garden herbs.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was way too bland.  I started reading hte reviews and added parsley, garlic powder, a little lemon juice and sour cream to try and add some flavor.  It's still just not edible and is going down the drain.  :(  The best homemade clam dip I've had was cream cheese, 1/2 c sour cream and a hidden valley ranch seasoning packet.  Super easy, really decent.

Not a favorite for my family, unfortunately.  Wish I had read the reviews first and tried adding the garlic as suggested by a few reviewers; this was definitely a bit bland and adding garlic and/or green onion might have helped!

Excellent recipe.  I used cayenne pepper and just a pinch of salt.  I had to thin it a bit with some sour cream until it was soft enough to dip a chip into without breaking.

I used several "dashes" of W. sauce, omitted hot pepper sauce b/c I hate the flavor of it, several dashes of ground black pepper, and added several dashes of Lawry's season salt.  I also used a 10 oz can of clams and chopped it up in my food processor.  Terrific!

This was very good. It gets better after sitting in the fridge a few hours. However, I still thought it needed a bit of a kick, so I added chopped green onion. That did it! I'll definitely make this again.

Also, add the clams last.  I omit hot sauce.  Add salt & pepper.  Rub the bowl with chopped garlic before you start and add more Worcestershire sauce and about 2 tsp lemon juice.  Really good with kettle cooked potato chips.  We have this every Christmas Eve,

The cream cheese seemed to hide the flavor of the clams.  I added an extra can of clams (chopped)in hopes by the next day the flavor will come through.  Sorry, not impressed with the recipe as it is.

This was SOOOO simple and went over REALLY well.  Made it as written - it went fast and was a great fill-in item with things that I always have.  Great emergency recipe for a dip that doesn't involve sour cream and an envelope of soup mix.  Classier.

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit as I found  it to be a little bland. I did add 2 tablespoons more or less of mayo and I also added considerably more Worcestershire sauce as well as the hot pepper sauce. Still needed something else, so I added garlic powder and salt and pepper and that seemed to do the trick.

For something so simple, it is so good. From my viewpoint, it matches the clam dip my mom used to make for her parties at the house, and I got to taste before the guests arrived. (In my time, the kiddos did not attend adult parties, I guess that dates me!!)

This was just ok. When following the recipe as written and even letting it set overnight, it was still bland to me.  I added more Worcestershire and some garlic salt and that helped, but I will likely not make again.

Very  yummy!  Coming from Oregon to Kentucky we can't find clam dip in any stores. This is better than any store clam dip we've had. I did add some garlic and onion powder to taste. Also, some lemon juice along with clam juice to make it less thick..so .you don't break your chip when you dip ;) Thanks for a good start to a great clam dip!

I  chose this recipe because of it's simplicity, and I had the ingredients already.  It was bland for my taste. Although I added about twice the amount of hot sauce and worsterchire, then some of the reseerved clam juice, lemon juice, salt and extra fresh ground black  pepper.  Then it was delicious.  My only other comment would be when it says to "reserve the clam juice, it doesn' say what for.  I saved what i had left to make New England Clam chowder! overall, it was a good basic, simple easy recipe.

Kind of bland as written.  I definitely added garlic to taste, I grated it to have a fine consistency, added chopped green onions, 1/2 cup sour cream, a splash or two of lemon juice and a little of the clam juice.  Served with ridged potato chips - addicting!

As written with the addition of two tablespoons of mayo to make it extra creamy.  
Thank you for sharing, we make it often.

This is the same recipe my mother used for YEARS!  After her passing I have just now stumbled upon it again, thank you!  
Tip: Make this dip the night prior to enjoying it, you'll appreciate the flavors coming together.  Perfect with Wavy Lays or even Pita Chips!

Its a great recipe and very Simple.  Ours is very similar.  We add a Tbsp. of fresh lemon juice (or more) to taste.  Ithe lemon really enhances the flavor.  We often add more clams and Worcestershire and serve it with ripple chips.  I've seen it with both cream cheese and cottage cheese.  Its thinner, but fewer calories and still ver tasty.

This is pretty good. Ive made it a couple time but its missing something. Cant put my finger on it, maybe some green onion, but it needs more of a kick. I'll keep trying! Thanks for the recipe!
