This was really good and I would definitely make it again!!  However, I didn’t see the point in salting the chicken and putting it on a rack and refrigerating it for 30 minutes.  Am I missing something?  I seasoned my chicken and lightly pounded it, but not to 1/4” thick – mine were closer to 1/2”.  I made the sauce as the recipe indicated with the exception of cutting the brown sugar to about 2-3 T.  I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch, just enough to give it some body and nice “cling.”  And darn, even though the Marsala wine was sitting right in front of my face, I forgot to put it in.  I’ll remember it next time!  Made as written I think it would have been excessively salty and way, way too sweet.  But with my minor changes, this is a five star!

I actually really liked this recipe, as did my 2 year old girls.  It gets 4 stars because my husband didn't like it.  But I think anyone that likes sweet dishes would like it.  I substituded 1/8 cup cider vinegar and 1/8 cup water for the sherry and added a bit of additional sugar.  Delicious!!

What an awesome recipe!  I never write reviews, actually this is my first.  I made this dinner last night for my family and what a hit.  Pleasing teenagers can be very difficult and they went back for seconds.  I doubled the recipe and it worked perfect for my family of 4.  It was really easy to make.  It will continue to be made in my household for years to come.  Thank You!!!

Thanks for sharing this recipe! It turned out great! I didn't have sherry so I used white wine and a gala apple figuring the sweeter apple would balance out substituting with the wine. It did, and was great! I also used a dash of cognac since I also didn't have Marsala wine. Followed everything else the same. Will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This recipe is delicious!  I found it one night when I was in need of a quick meal, and my husband and I immediately became big fans.  I only had cooking sherry, so I substituted white wine for the Marsala wine and it worked well.  Splenda brown sugar also cuts down on the carb count.

Delicious recipe! I didn't have Marsala, but I used a Riesling and it worked great. I also used gala apples since I had those on hand. It came out wonderfully, and my husband loved it.

This tasted great and like nothing I've ever made before; so good I'm writing my first review for it. I omitted Marsala, as I didn't have any on hand, put a bit less brown sugar and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce as another review stated.

Delicious, and truly a restaurant quality dish!  My husband made this for Valentine's Day and couldn't have made a better choice.  Wonderful with basmati rice!

Very tasty. Definitely one to make for guests. I didn't have any sherry or Marsala on hand, so I just substituted some Shiraz for both. I didn't have a Granny Smith, so I used a Macintosh, but since it's a softer apple, next time I would add it to the pan at the same time as the chicken, so there's still some firmness to the slices.
Update: I've also made this recipe with two pork chops. The sauce and apples go great with them too !

Hmmm....you can't say you followed the recipe to a T but skipped the sherry and marsala.  I actually did follow it to a T and it was great! A little sweet for my liking so will eliminate the white sugar and reduce the brown sugar next time. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This is not a hard recipe to make if one is organized in the kitchen. I found it rich, and very tasty. I served it on brown rice  cooked with olive oil in it, and the taste was off the chart. Using fresh cracked pepper left a very good taste. None of the individual items were overpowering, but when put together served each other well.

This is a very tasty fast meal.  I did a custom version for myself, as another reviewer said, the sugar can be cut way back, 2 TBSP is what I will use next time.  I did omit the salt, I used thin sliced Chicken breast and skipped the refrigerator and mallet parts.  I also sprinkled with Montreal Chicken spice first.  Next I will try adding raisins and omitting the sugar.  This is really worth making.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I will make this often.

Made this recipe for my family. I was so tasty and everyone loved it. You can replace apple juice for the alcohol, if you have none on hand.

The flavor is good enough but the chicken would have been much better IF it had been salted immediately before cooking (the salt makes the juices run out of the meat). As soon as these leaf thin meat slices have been cooked in butter, they are ready and any cooking after that only serves to make them tough and dry. Keep warm for as short a time as possible while the pan is deglazed with the sherry etc. I also find the dish too sweet, omit the white sugar.

Good recipe with just a little modification.
There's really no point in salting and refrigerating the breasts, it does nothing but make it too salty. Skipped.
Marsala is rare here in Mexico, so I used a Riesling, as other reviewers did, and it turned out fine.
Also cut down on the brown sugar, and added a bit of corn starch to thicken sauce.
My wife likes dishes a little sweet, and we both liked it.

I thought the recipe was simple and delicious.  It has a sweet taste to it, but it's not overpowering.  It's very easy and will be nice on a warmer day when I don't want to turn on the oven.  I served this with roasted potatoes and potatoes au gratin and both times it was delicious!  It is n ow on regular rotation for dinner parties.

Super good...skipped the 30 min. refrigeration and used water in place of sherry, canola oil in place of butter for browning.

Very nice, easy recipe.  I followed it with no modifications to ingredients.  I didn't refrigerate my chicken (next time I will purchase thin cutlets instead of breasts in order to save a step).  Will definitely make it again.  :)

This was OK- the whole family agreed it was good but not great. I followed the recipe exactly except- pay attention- I doubled it because the servings said two but really it was four. So I ended up with eight.
I also didn't think it was all that easy- might have been because I doubled it. 
Probably won't make this again.

Delicious.  I used brandy because I didn't have sherry.  My husband and I loved it.  Because we are not red meat eaters, we eat a lot of fish and chicken. This is a wonderful very different way of preparing chicken.

I was pleasantly surprised how good this was. Although, almost anything with brown sugar should be. It is harvest here in the Pacific Northwest, so I substituted the Granny Smiths with local Honey Crisps I had on hand. The sweet/tangy flavor really complimented the chicken. I served it with Couscous and fresh asparagus. I will definitely serve this again.

One word - delicious!  After reading the reviews about frying and using the oven and blah blah, I just decided to do the recipe as written. I did double it because chicken breasts I buy come in packs of 3 not 2.  I had no issues with the breading come of like others seemed to, it came out perfectly golden in the pan.  Once that was warming in the oven, I had to improvise with the sauce. I only had one apple and one can of chicken broth and no Marsala. To make up the difference in the chicken broth I added 2 ounces of white wine. I didn't worry about the Marsala. Once done I poured some of the sauce and apple chunks (I cut each slice into 2 pieces to make up for only having one apple) onto 2 of the chicken pieces and poured some of the sauce on top of rice pasta. It was yummy :) I will make this again.

This was DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper. I used a red delicious apple because that was what I had on hand, but I could see how the Granny Smith would add some tart to the sweetness. Will use one next time.

This is a great recipe.  I made it tonight as written, except for adding a little cornstarch to make it thicker. It was delicious with a brown and wild rice mix and broccoli.  Next time I think I will reduce the brown sugar, but it is good as is.  My husband liked it too, and we normally don't like fruit on our meat dishes.

Made according to recipe with the exception of using white wine instead of sherry and Marsala just because that's what I had in the fridge. Served with rice.

This was very good! My wife loved it! She ate more than she usually does and said "you can make this again". Followed the recipe...just did not add the pinch of white sugar.

Made this for a weeknight dinner.  It was indeed easy and so very tasty with a touch of fancy.  I didn't have any sherry or Marsala wine so I did what another reviewer did and used white wine (Riesling).  Turned out great.  Will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe with pork instead of chicken - my husband loves apples with pork.  I used thick pork loin chops and sliced them to about 1/3" thickness.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written, except that I did add some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken.  Next time I will not add the salt to the breading mixture.  We liked this very much! Thanks!

I give this recipe 5 stars. I just made it for supper and it was great. I did put in alittle more sugar and at the end I used a sweet red wine. The sauce with the apples and wine were tangy and sweet at the same time. I encourage everyone to try it for something different than the normal chicken dishes.

chicken very moist and sauce tasty.  Wasn't sure what a "dash" of marsala was so added too much but still very good, but space did not thicken.  Everyone said to make it again

My mom has owned 4 restaurants and is always teaching me new recipes. I made this for her and she was very impressed! She always asks for it as does my sister.  My in laws are visiting from England and I’m making this dish for them right now. I always make extra sauce and bacon wrapped potatoes to dip in that sauce. Amazing!!!!!

Home run!  What a delicious sweet and savory chicken with a well-balanced group of ingredients.  My teen loved it, and I can't wait to make it for my husband.  I made it as directed, except that I added two pinches of corn starch for thickening before putting the chicken in the sauce at the end.  The only thing I might change the next time is that I'll increase the sauce ingredients by a half.  The pan was fairly large to accommodate all the  flattened chicken.  Thus, the sherry and all the ingredients following it spread out and cooked down quickly.  I would have preferred having more sauce to spoon over the chicken when I served it... so the next time I will.   Nonetheless, I can't thank this cook enough for sharing the recipe!

This chicken was fantastic!  I always have a problem getting the coating to stick to the chicken while frying it, but one reviewers suggestion to dip in milk, flour, egg, then panko worked perfectly!  I used thighs instead of breasts and vegetable oil instead of corn oil because it was what I had on hand. My kids who don't like "meat" ate it up!  Will make this again!

Yum!  With a couple of modifications. I added cornstarch to the chicken stock.  2 chopped greens onions, too.  Next time I will add minced fresh ginger and a couple of cloves of garlic. (Doesn't everything need garlic?) Served with Basmati rice. Super good and I will make this again!

New favorite recipe! 
Skipped the marsala wine and putting chicken in fridge.  Also just covered chicken and put in microwave.  added a 1/4 cup extra sherry. Served with baked sweet potato and asparagus. Sooooo good!

Very good.  My son liked the apples especially.  I added a little cinnamon with the apples and brown sugar.  One thing I will do is make the sauce and apples, pour over the chicken and bake it for another ten minutes in the oven, for next time.  Make sure your chicken cutlets are thick enough for this first, otherwise they will overcook.

This was very good. My husband does not like apples but I do and loved it. He liked it but not with the apples so I took the apples out since there was plenty of leftovers and saved them as a treat for myself. Thanks DEUXMAC!

This was like soup.  I followed the recipe closely, but I ended up boiling chicken in "souped up" chicken broth from all of the sherry.

Easy and really tasty! I was looking for a new recipe to use with boneless chicken breasts and this turned out great. Followed recipe as written, except left out the white sugar as suggested by another reviewer. I used gala apples because that's what I had, and they worked fine. Will definitely make this again. The flavors of the sherry and marsala wines and the sweetness of the brown sugar blends really well. Chicken came out so tender and juicy!

Really good recipe. We had apples to use up and this was perfect for our family of six.  Picky eaters gave it a thumbs up. However they still wanted it separate when it came time to eating at the table. We paired it with rice, green beans on side. Great dish! Oh and we skipped the marsela as didnt have any, and used what I had of sherry and diluted apple cider vinegar per previous post. drank  moscato wine making it, wasnt brave enough to add it to recipe!

I love meat with fruit, so this was great. Added a lot more apple and only a tablespoon of sugar and even that may have been too much, next time I'll skip the sugar.

This was GREAT. I don't really cook with apples, but thought that my son would like it. I had an impromptu visit by a co-worker last night. I served this over rice and he said it was VERY good. I enjoyed it also. It was tasty. Will make more sauce next time to serve over the rice. I made substitutions based on what I had on hand: Asian rice cooking wine instead of sherry and white wine vinegar instead of the marsala wine (I have no idea what that is)... Still tasted GREAT. Don't hesitate to make this. The pan-fried chicken is also very good without the sauce...
