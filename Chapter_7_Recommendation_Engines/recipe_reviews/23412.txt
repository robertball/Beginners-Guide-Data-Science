I gave this four stars only because I made changes. I took advice of others and added 1 tsp. thyme, 1 tsp. more sage, 2c. more broth which I used to baste during baking and used 1/2 croutons 1/2 bread. I also added a can of mushrooms and let it sit in the fridge overnight. It came out so moist and so good people kept going back for more. One person told me it was the best stuffing he had ever had! That meant a lot because he thinks stuffing is the best thing on earth! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!!

This was a return to "yesteryear". A recipe that my Mom used to make. However, to indulge my wife's Mother's recipe I made couple of addtions in ingredients as well as sequence steps:

Within the celery volume I added cellery leaves.

I added 1/2 cup of minced parsley.

I shortened the drying time by first toasting all the bread to a light brown color...and then placing the slices in a large casserole dish in the microwave on a medium setting for 5 minutes. Then repeating it as needed until the bread was rigid when the microwave power was interrupted by opening the door and checking. That saved the 24hr drying time and brought it down into about 20 minutes.

I did not use a rolling pin to crush the bread into total crumbs, but crushed it by hand until there were crumbs and pieces in the bowl. Pieces were never larger than the average thumbnail and there were a lot of crumbs.

After placing the crushed bread in a bowl, add the dry ingredient-spices and thoroughly mix them together before adding the eggs and chicken broth.

Then mix the eggs and chicken broth together before adding to the crumb-spice mixture.

Then add the results of the sauted onion-celery mix without draining it.

Add more water if needed at this point so the resultant stuffing is moist and clumps together, but is not a mushy mess.

Four family traditions loved it!!

Absolutely incredible!!!!!!!
My mam-maw used to make this and unfortunately she never wrote down the recipe. My mother have tried to duplicate it with no luck! I was determined to find this recipe for Thanksgiving this year, and here it is.
I will say that I changed it a little: I used about a tablespoon of sage, and I did half and half fresh bread and the herbed Pepperidge Farm bread crumbs. Mam-maw used to use cornbread as well, but I was too busy to make any--next time I might add that as well.
Again, thank you so much!!!!!!

This is a good starter recipe for homemade stuffing - the hardest part is prepping.  The end result is good, but lacking substantial flavor.  We added 1 cup more chicken broth and upped the dose of sage.  (The called-for liquid amount is already too low, so more chicken broth makes the bread more moist and flavorful.)  It's hard to give up Stove Top, but making your own is worth the effort!

I loved this recipe, and so did my family.  I should have made a double batch, because they scraped the pan.  The only thing I did differently was to baste this dressing a couple of times with a turkey baster full of juice from the turkey I had roasted earlier in the day.

I was invited to my bf's sisters house for thanksgiving last year and was asked to bring the stuffing, I used this recipe and followed it to the T...and I don't know about you guys, but when the grandmother stands up and says this is delicious stuffing, I don't know what other compliment can be better.  Mind you, she made her own stuffing too...and she actually like mine better.  Thanks for the recipe, this year, they are all coming to our place for thanksgiving. ;)

This is exactly like my mother in law's recipe except that she didn't include celery and garlic and did add giblets chopped up.  I just wanted to chime in about dry stuffing reviews.  When she taught me to make this, there was no measure on the broth.  Her instructions were to add the broth in, cup by cup and when I could take two hands, grab some stuffing and form a softball size ball that held together, that was enough liquid.  I have used the same "measurement" for 30+ years and everyone loves it.  Always moist.  Enjoy!

I used rye bread and added mushrooms for a twist. It really gives it that extra flavor everyone says this stuffing is missing. It's been a favorite of my entire family for years.  Great recipe.

Good basic stuffing.  I used brownberry seasoned bread cubes.  I cut the recipe down to serve 6 and stuffed a perdue oven roaster with it.  Since I scaled the recipe down, I omitted the egg, which would have been 1/2 of an egg, so my allergic baby could enjoy some as well...and he did ;)  Thanks Lynn.

Oh! Something else I forgot to mention! Perhaps another reason some have found this to be dry could be because they are toasting the bread? I just lay my bread slices out on a cookie cooling rack for a couple of hours & then turn them over & let them sit for a bit more. I don't let them get totally dried out. Hope all of this helps!

Great recipe!  I made it for a Christmas dinner for friends here in Japan who had never had turkey or stuffing before, and they loved it!  I didn't have sage, so I used rosemary instead.  It was a big hit!

This was awesome! I cubed the bread instead of smashing it and I used poultry seasoning because I didn't have any sage. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! Used this recipe for the first time I've ever stuffed the turkey. I did add a little extra broth to make it the right consistency before stuffing it, but it turned out perfect. I cleaned and stuffed the turkey the night before Thanksgiving and in the morning, it was ready to go straight in the oven. Had a little stuffing left-over, pressed it into a 8x8 glass dish and cooked for about 1 hour. Great recipe!

This was very tasty.  The only thing I did differently, and it's because I like chunky, not creamy stuffing, is instead of toasting and crushing the bread with a rolling pin, I cut the bread into cubes and toasted them in the oven, then put them on the counter to dry out some more.  Everything else I followed as directed and it came out great!

This recipe is fantastic! I made a few adjustments to suit my preference. I used 1/2 stick of butter, used mostly whole wheat bread, and also added the extra teasp. of sage, about 2 Tablesoons dried parsley, and 1 teasp. of thyme.  Got a compliment immediately. Oh yes, I almost forgot, I took the advice on 'staling' the bread. After toasting, 4 slices in microwave for 1 min. will take care of making your bread nice and stale (I chopped easily with a large knife).

I love this recipe.... because there is room for your own personal touch..  I did everything Cindy Rae did (including the Mushrooms) I am a mushroom freak...  And I added a 1/2 cup of white wine, to the celery/onion/ butter Mix, near the end and let that reduce, then added a bacon & fried walnut (Yes, fried & drained together) mixture as well (Christmas always seems to have nuts?)  As well I added my spiced to the Bacon mixture while it was cooling down, this seemed to let the spices meld better..In my opinion of course..  Thank you for this great recipe all! (Including all the Mod/-ers)

I am not going to give this recipe a four or five and then say what I changed. I thought it was bland and dry. Why give a recipe a high score when it does not deserve it. I wished I would have researched others first.

Good stuff...just like Mom's.  Of course, she could never give me a recipe with amounts, etc.  I like the sauteeing the veggies first, that's how I grew up making it.  Only change I make is to used cubed bread--another preference (or cheat and use bags of herbed bread from the grocery!).  I play with liquid amounts to suit but this recipe as printed is generally spot on.  And I like to add a little evaporated milk bc that's how mom did it.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving and it turned out great, I made about 30 servings and it was enough for 16 people comfortably.  I also added the extra tsp. sage and 1 cup extra chicken broth. Great recipe, thanks!

This was really good.  I think it would have been better if I would have stuffed the turkey instead of cooked separate.  I followed the recipe exact.

Great stuffing!! I bought harded cut Artisan Bread in a bag from Safeway and used that instead of doing it myself and it was great! You need a BIG bowl to mix all this in and i had to add some water to it too! Its very easy and taste sooo much better than boxed stuffing!

Utterly delicious and so simple to make!  I've wanted to try my hand at homemade stuffing, and am so glad I found this.  My daughter has a gluten allergy, so I'm looking forward to tweaking this to suit her.

This recipe was good but onlyafter i added more sage and some tyme. I baked it for one hour but mid way through i pulled it out of the oven to taste it and it needed more flavor and it was dry so i added more chicken broth. After putting more flavor into it it was very good just like good ole stuffing that i am used to eating.

Ok, so I gave this 4 stars because, like others, things needed to be added to make it the BEST!
I too added more sage and I used 1/2 my homemade wheat bread  and 1/2 organic garden herb croutons. I also used organic cream of chicken soup for my extra flavor and liquid. Turned out awesome!
Thanks for this wonderful starter recipe.

Loved this recipe.  Everyone enjoyed it at our Thanksgiving dinner.  I made it for 6 servings.  I used about 7 slices of whole wheat bread.  I toasted the bread in the toaster and tried to use the rolling pin to crush it but it wouldn't work. It probably wasn't dry enough so I used the blender and that worked nicely.  I did have to double the broth content and the amount of sage.  It turned out amazing!

Thought this was delicious. The only thing I changed was to add carrots as well. I also used a little more stock because I didn't want it to be dry, I just kept adding more stock as it was cooking. Also save some stock if you are reheating it or making this in advance, the stock really helps the flavor to stay in and the stuffing to not dry out when it is reheated.

made this exactly like the recipe says and took to my family's Thanksgiving potluck today.  About 1/4 of it got eaten.  Probably won't make again.  I thought it tasted okay, but I've had much much better.

My family and I were REALLY pleased with the way this turned out--even my 4-yr-old said it tasted good. Sorry, Mom, this is better than yours (it's a good thing she doesn't use the internet, huh?) I halved this recipe, as this was just to be served as a side dish for our "Thanksgiving in July" dinner (3 adults and 2 picky kids), and we had enough left over to freeze for another meal--I hope it freezes well! Anyway, I only made a few changes (as usual): I used homemade corn (flavored) bread from the bread machine, which I cut into small cubes rather than crush w/rolling pin; I added chopped celery tops with a small, diced stalk, one finely diced med carrot and 1/2 a diced green apple, I also used 1/4 red onion and 1/4 reg onion. When sauteeing the veggies, they looked so colorful and smelled so good, that I might end up creating some type of salad that I serve just as is. I ended up having to use 1-1/2 cans of chicken broth to get the right consistency, which when cooked came out perfect-not too mushy, not too dry. As suggested by BobL, DON'T drain the veggies mix, mix the egg in w/broth before adding, and I just mixed this w/my hands, as it's the way I always saw my mom doing it, and seemed like the easiest way. Great taste and really pretty easy to make--I'll be using this for the real Thanksgiving meal this year, as my mom doesn't cook the family meal anymore and my husband says his mom never could make dressing that wasn't from a box (thank goodness she doesn't use this si

I followed this recipe to a T and it came out very dry and flavorless. I would suggest more broth and sage. It was a disappointment on Thanksgiving.

I made this recipe for a Thanksgiving lunch at work.  I had to make enough for 40 people.  I should have made enough for 80, it went so quickly.  Everyone loved it.  I did add grated carrot to the onions and celery though.  Thanks Lynn for the recipe

I gave this recipe 5-stars because it is exactly what it says: old fashioned stuffing. Like Grandma's. With that said, some people might find it somewhat unspectacular for exactly that reason. I did add some poultry seasoning in addition to the sage that was called for in the recipe after tasting the final mix.

This recipe is great, but i did also make a couple of changes.  I was looking for a recipe similar to what my mom used to make as she has passed and no one had her special recipe.  i had, however, remembered her addition of Tennessee Pride sage or mild sausage and chicken bits.  I added 1lb of mild saugage, cooked and crumbled and i crockpot cooked chicken breast.  another change was that i used a sage mixture that included thyme and majorine, (sp).  I also ended up having to use 5 cups of broth in order to make the mixture more wet. Overall, a great starter recipe and i'm glad I found it so I can tweak it a little here and there to make it just like my mom used to make it!

I also added more liquid, but I used half and half as the extra liquid.  It make it so moist and rich tasting.  I upped the sage a bit as well as added a couple more eggs.  But this is a good basic recipe!

I didn't like stuffing before I found this recipe, but gave it another shot for an upcoming potluck.  Instead of using sliced bread, I picked up a loaf of French bread at the market.  Didn't have time to dry out the bread the night before, so I sliced it up, laid the slices flat on a cookie sheet, and stuck it in the oven at about 200 degrees for an hour or 2 to dry it out.  The French bread made all the difference, and gave the stuffing a fabulous, chewy but not wet texture.  Friends at the potluck raved about it.  I did add some chicken broth halfway through, like others did.

This was a good recipe..I used a little gravy and added in to make it a little more moist when serving..but that was my fault because I had to wait for the turkey to finish and everything else was done ! WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!

This stuffing is really great. I used it to stuff my 15 lbs turkey and had "leftovers" for another caserole which I baked separately. The one cooked inside the turkey turned out beautifully, but the caserole one was a little bit dry. I think I will either cover it more or put more broth. The veggies need to be really soft before you mix them with the bread. I used a mix of rye and sourdough. Simply wonderful. Thanks for sharing this one!

This stuffing was great!!  I changed a few things. I used half a roll of Bob Evans sage sausage instead of the turkey liver, and used dried cherries instead of cranberries, just because thats what I had. I also added a bit more chicken broth, as it seemed a little dry, but the flavor was spectacular. Everyone loved it.

Okay you know you aren't getting anything jazzy when you make plain old bread stuffing... but this is delicious and just tastes like memories. I used my own homemade stock for this and I made it up the night before, pressing it into a pan and covering it to sit overnight. In one hour at 325, it was crispy on the top and bottom, soft in the middle, and full of that traditional flavor. Homemade stock really seals the deal on this keeper!

I have a feeling that with practice, I will be rating this higher!!  It came out very dry for me.  I've never made my own stuffing before, though, either, so I have a feeling that was the fault of the cook.  I love the taste, however!!!  I stuffed some in a chicken, and baked the rest.  I liked the flavor of the stuff in the chicken more.  I am going to keep trying this until I get it right!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

I used this recipe because it sounded SOOO very similar to the stuffing recipe my parents made EVERY holiday when I was growing up.  I have since lost that recipe but was having my mother over for Thanksgiving and wanted things to be just right.  She LOVED the stuffing and thought it was a FABULOUS recipe.  That comment from a woman who has cooked her fair share of Thanksgiving feasts.  What a compliment!  THANKS!

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I followed it exactly as written, but found that the finished product was very bland.  I have since read the other reviewers and will definitely add more spices if I make this again.  I even went out and bought rubbed sage, but maybe I should have also added thyme or poultry seasoning.  Like I said, very disappointing.

Thank you Lynn!!!!!! This was just like my Gram used to make!! Since she wasn't here with us this Holiday season, it was so nice to be able to carry on this great stuffing tradtion for my kids! I did use the shortcut method for drying the toast in the microwave....but other than that followed the recipe exactly and it was WONDERFUL!!!! Thanks again!!!

This turned out wonderful. I have tried several recipies looking for a Dressing that’s a keeper.  I did add more chicken broth during cooking.  But it turned out just the way I like it. My search for a Great Dressing recipies is now over.

I thought I did everything right.  But mine turned out really dry!  The flavor was good, but it was way too dry.  I'll do it differently next time!

This is a simple but very delicious recipe. I used it as a casserole top crust and the excess I baked and topped with shredded cheddar cheese just long enough to melt the cheese.

Made this for dinner tonight...and delicious.  This is my grandma's recipe (with a slight variation on the sage).  We also only add 1 egg and a little bit more onion.  Delicous.  Everyone ate this up with very little left over (bit disappointed....wanted to bring some home).  Thanks for the post.

This was okay.  I think it would be good with double the celery and a few more spices (like marjoram, thyme...) and maybe some more onion.  Of course, I cooked mine outside the turkey so keep that in mind when deciding whether to try it for yourself.

As a transplant from St. Louis via Shreveport to the New Orleans area, I have been to many Thanksgiving feasts offering oyster dressing or dirty rice as the stuffing!  This recipe was easy and came out perfectly!  I use chopped garlic in oil (my hands are seriously arthritic) instead of powdered garlic-I think it tastes better and is certainly easier!  Great memories!!!!!

This I the recipe I grew up with. I used to love be to tear up the bread when I was a kid and not get into trouble for doing it. Only variation is we didn't toast the bread pulled it apart out of the wrapper and we didn't cook onions and celery it cooked as it baked . Don't make to wet or it will be tough and for added hight add a teaspoon of baking powder to the broth and mix until smooth then pour it in bread. It's the best dressing. Love to cook it still today. My kids always ask for it at family get together

My mom is 78 and she has been making her moms stuffing all my life. Her recipe is almost like this one. The only difference is, she doesn't toast her bread, and she adds poultry seasoning.  We cut each slice of bread into squares and let it sit out overnight.
I eat that stuffing as a snack and as a meal. Lol
I pour gravy over my plate of stuffing. Lol

Similar to mine except I add cream of chicken soup for more flavor and creamier texture. I do not crush bread or toast it, but let it sit out to dry for a day, then cube it. I like moist stuffing and I leave out sage because not everyone likes it.

Nice, basic recipe.  I used more onion, sage, thyme and instead of chicken broth, used my mom's secret ingredient - Lipton's cup of soup - noodles and all!!!  So yummy.

This is very similar to my father's family recipe, and the changes that I've made have served to make it even better.  I use half and half--Pepperidge Farm country loaf, cut into cubes and left out overnight and a bag of sage-flavored prepared stuffing mix.  I also buy some turkey parts (legs and wings) the week before and make my own rich turkey broth, browning them with onions, carrots and celery in a 500 degree oven until they're very brown and then adding chicken broth and baking overnight in a 250 degree oven.  This makes all the difference and I have the juices from the turkey to use in the gravy ( I also use the leftover broth that I've made if I want a lot of gravy).  I'm told my dressing is always the best part of the dinner!

This old sage and onion  recipe is the same as my Grandma's... I've had this every year for 51 years. It's absolutely delicious. We've had it with fresh bread or Pepperidge Farms Bread Stuffing as well. Both are great! We never used cornbread, we always used regular toasted French bread when we made it. We always cooked it inside the turkey and the rest was cooked in a casserole dish. It's the best stuffing recipe hands down. It even gets better the next day!

Great dressing that I am so glad to have found.  My adult son came along just as I was about to crack the egg and insisted I leave it out so I added a bit more chicken broth and some walnuts.  otherwise I  followed the recipe as stated and it was great. Tasted like my mothers from so many years ago. Everyone loved it. Thank you so much for a great recipe.

This is so very close to my grandmothers dressing, but it did turn out a little dry in the pan, but what was stuffed into the turkey was great. if you bake it in the pan i would add another egg or some more broth. other than that it was great.

I love this recipe! It didn't turn out soggy like the box ones! The only difference I did was make it with gluten free bread since my husband has celiac disease and can't eat gluten.

Sorry, I have not tried this recipe, but gave it 4 stars because it is close to the one I've used for years. I use more broth...3 to 4 cups, and the best results come from using broth and drippings from your baked turkey. I also add about two cups of diced turkey...those little tender niblets you can get from the neck and wing meat. Our "clan" family always made a huge pan of plain dressing plus a pan of oyster dressing on Thanksgiving day. My grandmother never wrote down her recipe either, but one day I stood in her kitchen with paper and pen and asked her to tell me the best she could. So glad I did. Been making it for years!

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site. It was a big hit this Thanksgiving. There's a lot more work involved than busting out a box of instant stuff, but it was so worth it. Great flavor and texture. I never imagined adding eggs to stuffing but it so works! My only concern is that the recipe didn't seem to make as much as I thought it would. I recommend doubling it if you have a houseful coming over for turkey day!

I thought it was good, but lacked spices. I will try it again and use more to see if i get get the taste right. BTW, I used everything Gluten Free. I used the Udi's Gluten Free Multigrain. The consistency was great I just thought it lacked flavor.

Became a rock hard brick. Perhaps if more liquid was used it would have worked, but I could not even bring myself to taste it.

Recipe got rave reviews from my Thanksgiving guests, but I did make adjustments:
-Used 4 c. broth instead of two
-Added another egg, meaning 3 eggs instead of 4
-I didn't drain the onions and celery before adding to bread
-Added 3 teaspoons fresh sage instead of two
-Added 1 teaspoon thyme
-As well, I cubed the bread the day before and toasted, then left out all night

If you want to make this ahead of time, have some extra chicken broth on hand to baste the stuffing for reheating - the stuffing can easily dry out.

Just like my Mimmie made except we broke the bread up in peices and let dry for a couple days tossing gently. You can put in 200 degree oven to toast the bread also. Very gently mixing ingredients to keep fluffy and we used 3 eggs. Very good recipe and good oldfashion southern eaten.

I also altered this recipe. I baked it inside turkey, used celery carrots little but of chopped dill, couple loafs of bread (rite off shelf) Campbell's chicken broth, onions n whatever other veggies I had.
Chop all veggies into tiny pieces
In a frying pan place onion, celery , and other veggies.  Couple tbsp of butter. Add oil fry veggies and add spices to veggies...again I used what ever spices+ onion garlic seasoning salt Italian spice whatever....once fried add 1/3 chicken broth and add bread pieces either cut or rip into pieces add to pan. Stir mix add more spices ...add more broth amd more bread as wanted....once fully coomed n fluid absorbed and mixture damp not soaked. ..make a tinfoil envelope to place in bird cavity or if extra room outside bird place there. Bake with turkey remove when birds done. Baste as needed enjoy

Tried this recipe on the weekend, I made roast chicken and used this recipe to stuff it. My kids and husband couldn't get enough, my youngest even wanted it for school in his sandwiches. This is defiantly a keeper

I put mine into a stuffing bag then put it in the turkey and it turned out really mushy but maybe it was because the bag. Flavor was great though! I wll try this recipe without the bag next time.

Nice flavor, but really dry.  I even doubled the chicken broth.  The middle section turned out fine, but the sides were left to throw away.  If I make it again I won't use as much bread.  I did take another reviewers suggestion and leave some fingernail-size chunks along with the crumbs.  I did like that.  I also added 1 Tablespoon of sage.

This was my first attempt at making home made stuffing and it turned out well.  I used home made bread and had to add twice as much chicken broth as it called for.  I also added a little poultry seasoning and thyme to spice it up a bit.  Yummy!
