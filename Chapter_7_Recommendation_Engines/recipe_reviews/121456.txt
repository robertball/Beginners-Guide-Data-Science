WOW!  This is a huge hit at our house.  I followed all directions, but added minced garlic.  I made muffins and a 8x8 pan the first time and didn't really care for the muffins.  The next time I made 2 8x8 pans.  It kind of reminds you of the cheese bread from Red Lobster.  Yum!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a life saver! I wanted to do bread but had no yeast. I used the baking mix recipe from this site, and I also didn't cook the onions first, I sort of like them par-cooked and they came out tender but still with some white color. I used 2 rectangle bread pans, and it took more like 30-35 mins in my oven to firm up. Delicious, buttery goodness and certainly worth a try.

I made this bread on a snowy stuck in the house day..I followed all the directions but added garlic and not having 2 8x8 pans dumped it all in a bunt pan..10 minutes longer..fantastic
Everyone loved it..Still next day used it for grilled cheese for breakfast..really really a family favorite now

Needed a quick baked item for Holiday gift giving at the office.  I modified the recipe by using 2 medium onions which I cooked until caramelized (10 minutes), increased the cheese to 2 cups (sharp cheddar), and added 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning to the dry mixture(no fresh herbs available); I then sprinkled the top lightly with grated cheese. Using mini bread pans (4x8) I cooked 3 at a time for 25 minutes. 3 batches made 10 loaves. The bread came out super moist, and the caramelized onions are a major 'wow' factor in your mouth. Perfect as a side to a hearty dinner, soup & salad or even toasted as a snack.

Fantastic and very simple to make! My whole family loved it. I halved the recipe, baked it in an 8" pie pan and used fresh parsley instead of dried. After baking for 15 minutes, sprinkled the top with reserved parsley and cheese and gave it another 5 minutes. My two sons already want to know when we can have it again!

Super easy and we loved it. I even substituted onion flakes for real onion and it was still yummy.

This was really good.  In fact, I messed up and didn't pre cook the onions...ended up just putting them in the mix raw with the cheese.  I cooked the bread at a lower temp (325) and cooked it a bit longer, probebly about 45 minutes, and the onions turned out tender.....tasted really good, especially with melted butter and garlic powder on top!

I really can't find a reason to not give this 5 stars.  I followed the recipe as printed, only changing to fresh parsley instead of dried since I had some.  I cut the recipe in half and did only one 8" pan.  It not only tasted divine, it looks really good, too.  Nice and cheesy and crusty on top.  It was a nice accompaniment to some potato/corn chowder that I made.  My husband said "you can make that again".  High praise.  Thanks for the good recipe.

Made this bread with a few changes, used red onions 1.5 cups, added fresh garlic, and a cup of fetta cheese, and skipped the butter. Will make again; but next time I will add some cumin and some dry rosemary.

I made this in a muffin tin rather than a loaf pan.  The texture turned out nicely, and my husband said he liked them, although I thought they could have used a bit more flavor.  Will definitely make them again, but may play around a bit with the recipe...thanks!

Wow!! This was a fabulous bread! The only reasons for not giving it 5 stars was I had to bake it double the time(40 mins) and I am glad I didn't put the cheese on the top right away or it would have burnt! I plopped it on top after pulling it out of the oven and it just melted beautifully. I followed the recipe, but used a mix of cheddar cheese and pepper jack for a little zing! I also added 3 cloves of garlic and 1/4 tsp of cumin. It is delicious!!! I will surely make this again!!
