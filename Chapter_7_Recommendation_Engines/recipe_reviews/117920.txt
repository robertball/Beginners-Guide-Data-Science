The first time I made this, I made it exact.  From there I knew what to add.  Me?  I don't care for much heat, but I did use 3 cloves of pressed garlic and used a lot less oil on the veggies.  I love it! It's pretty healthy, low-fat and filling!

I was really excited about this because we love couscous. It was actually pretty bland. My family had to add soy sauce at the table. I would spice up the chicken next time and maybe use basil or thyme instead of rosemary on the veggies.

My goal in making this was a quick, light meal for two people and it fulfilled all my expectations.  Having no squash and no oven I adapted it slightly - I stir fried the peppers, garlic and onion together with the rosemary until slightly wilted before adding the chicken and stir-frying everything. Besides that I followed the recipe.  Altogether, it was 45 minutes from start to finish and my husband (who hates couscous) said "This is actually not bad! I'd eat it again!"

This wasn't bland for me at all!  I had added an extra garlic clove because of reviews claiming blandness, but I don't think I needed it.  Other changes include accidentally using cilantro instead of rosemary (I didn't realize it until the veggies were broiling haha), and replacing the minced onion with diced green onion. I just find that dried onion doesn't give enough flavor for me.  The couscous I used was some sort of roasted pine nut flavor. It was the only kind Acme had and I'd never had it before, so I was worried, but it was great!

Very simple and reasonably good recipe. I found I had ran out of rosemary so used a mix of basil, thyme, and oregano. As other people have said it's a little bland on its own BUT this can be easily corrected. Use a flavored couscous (or better yet flavor it yourself with a dab of butter and some extra broth and some seasonings!) and put the chicken 1/2 cooked in with the couscous so that it gets some of the flavor. The end product should be a more flavorful chicken.

I love this recipe!!!!!!! This is one of my wifes favorite dishes that I make. The great thing about this recipe is you can make it as written or you can just use whatever vegetables you have available, and it tastes delightful either way.
