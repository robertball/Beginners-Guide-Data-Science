I love sweet potatoes, but I do not want added sugar.  Not because of any dietary restrictions - I just think sweet potatoes are sweet enough without added sugar.   I did not stuff these.  I just  used the roasted sweet potatoes with the other ingredients and put them in a casserole.  Mostly because I was having  14 people and no one really wanted a whole sweet potato.  A few delicious tablespoons were plenty and very appreciated.

These came out fantastic!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (I'm vegetarian so I omitted the bacon and just sauteed the green onions/jalapeños in olive oil) and they were incredibly tasty.  I wasn't sure whether the recipe called for fresh jalapeños, but I used pickled slices in brine and they worked great.  The only note I have is to allow for a lot longer initial cooking time for the sweet potatoes: I had to bake them for 50+ minutes before they were tender enough to mash.

This recipe is awesome! We have made it several times and it is always so delicious to the point of being addictive. The savory/salty of the bacon with the sweetness of the potato along with the jalapeno (who knew that would be great!) is a great combination. My oldest daughter and I fight for the leftovers (I am currently winning as she is away in the Air Force but she can't wait to come home to Chef John recipes!). Another Chef John hit!

These were great, but I made the following changes:
1. I cut the yams in half after softening so I could use both top and bottom rather than throwing out the top third.  The skin slides off really easily, I didn't worry about leaving a base of yam, just used a bare skin. 
2. I used a full 8 oz. block of cheddar
3. I cooked the bacon in my air fryer and just used a small amount of the fat to sautee the scallions and jalapenos.  I thought the grease from that much bacon was just  too much to put into the yam mixture
4. I used a full 4 oz. of sour cream

I cooked them ahead of time to bring to our family Thanksgiving, and just reheated then when we got there. Everyone loved them. I'm going to make them again for my Christmas party!
