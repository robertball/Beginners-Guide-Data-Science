I increased this recipe to serve three. I did NOT have coconut cream but I did have coconut extract--I used a tablespoon of that. My bananas were frozen which eliminated the need for ice. What's great about this drink is it gets really frothy which makes you think you're drinking bananas and coconut that have been folded into whipped topping. We were divided on this smoothie. The youngest and I really liked it but my oldest did not. I'll make this again, if just for me.

Wow, this tasted soo good! I went to make it and realized the calories seemed really high though. I ended up buying lite coconut cream and using low-fat milk, and getting 2 servings instead of 1. That helped the calorie count some. However, the sugar and saturated fat count is still a kind of high from the coconut milk, even though there is no added sugar in the recipe. I did not know that about coconut milk. The drink doesn't get real thick, but the taste is awesome anyway! I used 5 ice cubes as it did not indicated how many to use. I did enjoy it though. ty

My coconut cream wasn't sweetened, so I added a bit of honey. Fantastic!

I normally have at least one smoothie a day. Since discovering this recipe, I've been having 2-3 a day... all of them banana coconut. The flavor is very tropical and perfect for a summer afternoon. I freeze my bananas and add a decent amount ice to make it thicker. So yummy!

I use unsweetened coconut milk for all of my smoothies. Just freeze bags in singles servings of your  favorite fruits, 1 cup of unsweetened coconut milk, blend it all in my Ninja and that's it!!  No ice needed

My 5-year-old daughter loved this smoothie with whole milk maple yogurt, honey, cinnamon, and a little bit of sugar!

I absolutely love this smoothie recipe. It's sweet, but not overly sweet. I added almonds to the ingredients and topped it off with coconut flakes.  

I saw that a few people said it didn't get thick.  All you have to do is keep adding ice until it gets as thick as you like. I also used the whip cycle on my blender.  Mine turned out nice and thick.

It came out really runny. We used the coconut milk in the can.
