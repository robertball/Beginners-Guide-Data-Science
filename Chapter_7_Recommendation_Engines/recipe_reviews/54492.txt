Well this site is very kind: it won't let me give this recipe "no star." I have never rated a recipe so low. With the familiar ingredients, easy technique, and my own experience, I thought I couldn't go wrong, despite the not-so-hot reviews. One reviewer questioned the addition of corn starch so early in the cooking: good question. That seems to be what went wrong. The flavor wasn't TOO bad, but all in all, this was a failure. I have used all of these ingredients in the past, mostly together or in similar dishes, but in this dish, it all went terribly wrong. Thank goodness for rice and a salad on the side.

Just to clear up confusion: adding corn starch to the marinade is a common technique known as "velveting" -- it keeps the chicken from drying out during cooking. I've come across recipes for beef using the same technique, and the more AUTHENTIC Chinese recipes you make, the more often you'll see it.

This recipe did not have enough flavor to it. I also don't feel the cornstarch should of been added to the first part of the recipe. Annette Jensen...Canada

This is very good -I added different vegetables BUT DO NOT add 1 1/2 tbsp of chili paste with garlic. I like hot food and added about 3/4 of a tbsp. and it was WAY TOO HOT!!

I pressed all the liquid from the tofu first then fried in peanut oil and set aside. I added more garlic ,carrots and baby peppers with the chicken.

We loved it and the kids did too.  Next time I will add more veggies.  Could never find the chili paste so used chili seasoning and it turned out very good

This sauce really had no flavor- I had to end up adding many more ingredients to spice this up.  Not the best recipe for Stir Fry.

I used cooking sherry instead of rice wine, doubled the amount of soy sauce and chili sauce and also added salt and pepper in marinade.  Also only added mixture of water, corn starch and oyster sauce at the end.  It’s a typical Asian stir fry recipe with added chili sauce / garlic.  First time using chili sauce w garlic and it’s good.

I will definitely make this again!  Since I did not have chicken breast, I used boneless chicken thighs cut into bite size pieces.  I used Seasoned Rice Vinegar as I did not have Rice Wine.  Vegetables used were yellow and red bell peppers, snow peas, and carrots.  Deeeelish!
