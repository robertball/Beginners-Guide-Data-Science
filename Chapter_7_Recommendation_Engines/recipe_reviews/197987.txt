Very good and easy to make. Substituted brown rice syrup for lite corn syrup and brown sugar for healthier snack.

Easy to make. Loved by non-gluten free eaters.  used only 3.5 cups of Rice Chex instead of cinnamon Chex.

I needed to make a dessert for a gluten-free friend, and chose this. Instead of dried apples, I used a dried tropical fruit mix, and I thought it turned out very nice.

This was really good.  Made it for a gluten-free friend, but had to taste test it first and we all loved it and will add it to our snack recipes.  Left out the cranberries as mine weren't sweetened.

I absolutely LOVE these - and they have become a smash hit overseas with my husband's group during deployment! The cinnamon Chex is a MUST! And I get a dried fruit mix of apples and mixed berries - so it has a very nice tangy & sweet combo! Make sure to have the dry mix in a more narrow, glass bowl when you pour in the hot syrup-y stuff as it makes it MUCH easier to coat evenly - I made the mistake of using a very wide plastic bowl the first time and the coating was extremely uneven and hard to deal with. The next time, I used the glass bowl and it worked like a dream!

Super Simple! And amazingly yummy.
Excellent just as the recipe calls for, but my brain started ticking off possibilities such as banana chips instead of the apples, chocolate chips and pecans instead of the cranberries and almonds.  Or how about dried pineapple, coconut, and pecans. 
I'll be making these on a regular basis.

These tasted great, but were very crunchy, not chewy.  I think I might double the syrup next time for a chewier treat.
