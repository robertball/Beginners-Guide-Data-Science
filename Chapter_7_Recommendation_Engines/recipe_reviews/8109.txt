When the correct ingredients are used this recipe is 5 stars and very easy.  This is very similar to my family recipe, except (as others have noticed) it's missing the most important ingredient MOLASSES.  Split the water into two containers, disolve the baking soda in 1/4 cup and disolve 1cup molasses in the other.  Mix as per recipe discription.  Batter is very liquidy, but cake is not.

I make this cake from my mother-in-laws recipe. She is PA Dutch. You really need molasses - use instead of oil. Will taste more like shoo-fly pie. I rated this recipe using molasses not oil.

The cake tasted too floury and was somewhat puddingy.  My family did not like it.

Did not taste like shoo fly at all. Made again with black strap molasses (half oil/half molasses) turned out much better.I kept the oil unlike others to keep moisture in the cake.

This recipe did not taste at all like shoo fly pie....probably because there is no molasses in the recipe.

I've never tasted Shoo Fly Pie, so I can't compare to that. But instead of just oil, I put a little bit of oil, and a lot of maple syrup (didn't have molasses). It tastes good to me! The consistency is more like a bread than a cake, though.

Easy to make. Floury taste. We added maple syrup and it turned out great, though.

This cake was kinda dry, and not molasses tasting like a shoo fly pie has.  The recipe didn't have any molasses in it maybe that's why it didn't have the shoo fly pie taste / flavor ? Most of the crumb topping fell to the bottom of the baked cake. Only a little circle in the middle of the cake did the crumbs stay on top of the cake. Maybe i will try again ?

My mother got this recipe from a friend a long time ago and lost it.  I finally found it here and remember it as a child.  It's great for breakfast too!

I found this recipe and changed it a little to make something kind of like a coffee crumb cake and it was amazing. Thank you so much!
