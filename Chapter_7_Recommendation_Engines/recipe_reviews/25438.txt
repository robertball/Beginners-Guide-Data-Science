Well normally I am a firm believer in using the BBQ sauce that you are familiar with and love but I changed my mind after this recipe. My go to BBQ sauce is a tomato based vinegary Kansas City style sauce however in this recipe I think it would have been better if I would have used a more brown hickory sweet sauce. My go to sauce with the addition of the can tomatoes resulted in a very acidic sauce. I think you really need the sugar in the sweeter sauces to counteract the tomatoes to make this one work. I recommend going with a brown/brown sugar-y BBQ sauce for this one.
