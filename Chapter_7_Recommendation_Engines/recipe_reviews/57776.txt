I chose not to use this as a dip, I actually used it as a salad dressing for Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad. This was exactly what I was looking for. It was an excellent addition to my salad. The longer it sits, the better it gets. VERY good and insanely simple. I'll use this "dressing" recipe again. NOTE: I cannot stress enough how important it is to use a quality balsamic. Mine pours out almost like molasses and the flavor is incredible. Using a cheaper balsamic will give you inferior results. Trust me.

Fabulous!  This makes a great appetizer served with warm italian bread.  I love to get this in restaurants and it was nice to be able to do this at home.  I decreased the amount of balsamic vinegar (and I love balsamic). I also used minced garlic from a jar.  I added a little kosher salt and if you like a little kick try adding 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes.

This was just okay for us.  I made the recipe as written.  Although the dip was flavorful, we felt there was too much garlic and oregano added which tasted very spicey.  Maybe we are just used to the olive oil dip at the restaurants that they pour from a bottle and the spices are marinating in the bottle, not ending up on the bread.  I will try again making adjustments to the oregano and garlic.

Awesome dipping oil for bread.  I used the left over oil and bread to make the most delicious croutons.  Take left overs a put into a gallon sized zip bag.  Shake to cover bread evenly.  Place on a cookie sheet under a low broil.  Broil for about 1 minute on each side.  YUM!

We really enjoyed this.  I found this at the last minute when i decided I wanted a dipping sauce for my fresh baguettes for a dinner party.  I was searching for the recipe I usually used, but this new one caught my eye and I decided to give it a whirl (I love trying new recipes w/just a few reviews)!  I followed the recipe (w/the exception of subbing pre-minced garlic for fresh pressed), but I split it on 3 saucer sized plates.  TY for a great recipe, Jill!

Yum, we really liked this. Very flavorful. Might be a tad too much balsamic for me, but that's easy to adjust. I'm a garlic nut, so you can't have enough IMO. I used my garden grown, dried oregano and more fresh parm. I even used some of this mixture in my Garlic & Herb Cream Cheese stuffed mushrooms.

I found this recipe after looking for a bread dip. I have a heart condition and shouldn't have bread and butter so this fit the doctor's bill. I didn't measure the ingredients, mixed them all together, omitted the cheese and added oregano (I love oregano) and it was great. I would recommend this to all who are eating a heart healthy diet. But be sure to use whole grain bread.

This was Okay. I did not add as much garlic...5 cloves just seemed extreme (cut to 2). Make sure you use a really good olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the best taste.

OMG! This tastes just like the restaurants oil!! I used pre-chopped garlic (the one in the glass jar sealed w/ water) and powdered parmesean as opposed to the fresh stuff- it was still delish!! And super easy too. I had enough for the next day's lunch and it tastes yummy the next day as well. This is one for the recipe book- great if you are making a romantic/special dinner!Super quick (like one min.) and easy!!

The oil/vinegar/spices combination was good, but the parmesan turned into a gloppy mess with a very strange texture.  I used grated parmesan (not shredded), maybe that's the problem - the recipe did not specify.  Will try again, but leave the parmesan out.

Super simple and fast way to dress up a loaf of french bread, and very tasty! We especially love the flavor of the balsamic vinegar.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  This would be great for a dinner party since it seems "fancier" than plain garlic bread.

To be honest, I really didn't see the point of pressing the garlic all over a plate and pouring the oil and vinegar over it, since there was just two of us.  I just whisked everything together in a bowl.  I used only two cloves of garlic and substituted tarragon vinegar instead of balsamic, since I was out.  It was very good, and if I ever prepare it for a group, I'll use the plate as stated in the recipe.

Very easy to do.  I cut down on the garlic cloves so I would reccommend only 1 or 2 but just be sure to taste it before you add all the garlic

I've tried a similar dip but the garlic and fresh oregano were toasted in the olive oil, giving a better all-around flavor.

I had a delicious herb bread on hand and was craving some EVOO Dip. So glad that I came across this recipe :) I  used 5 large cloves of garlic and it was perfect! Will definitely be making this one again soon. Thanks for a fantastic recipe :)

May be better with sun-dried tomatoes and an additional spice......not sure what though.  Still, not too shabby.

I really like garlic, used TWO cloves, and still thought it was very garlicky, nearly overpowering the other beautiful flavors.  Otherwise, 5 stars!

This was really good! I had company and wanted to have something to dip the french bread in.  So, I doubled this recipe.  I did mince the garlic, reduced the vinegar by half, and used 2/3rds of the oregano.  The cheese stayed the same, and I did add salt and a lot of fresh ground black pepper. I put it all into a jar, shook it really well and refrigerated it overnight.  GREAT!  They actually used it on their salads, too!  Good recipe here....and EASY!

Easy, quick and good.  don't know if it's really like the restaurants--this is more of a balsamic salad dressing to me, but we both liked it.  helped us use just a little bit more of our italian bread.  thanks for the recipe1

I came upon avocado oil as a sub for EVOO. Wow! Dropped the balsamic because avo has a full mouth to it and was just taken by its' flavor. Parm/Romano is a nice blend. (d'avo was the brand, and local Italian market has the cheese blend)

SO good! My garlic was sprouting :o( so I was forced to use the powdered stuff. However, I was still impressed by the awesome flavor of this dipping oil. I only made half of the recipe and cut the balsamic vinegar down a tad. I figured I could always increase it if I felt it needed it but I wouldn't be able to take some out if I felt it was too overpowering. So, I suggest you do the same and adjust it to taste. Oh, I added a pinch of kosher salt. Awesome!

Good recipe and so easy to make.  I had extra rosemary one time so I sauted it and added olive oil to it.  I also added some roasted garlic.  I use that olive oil to make this recipe.  Yum!

Loving Italian cuisine I was surprised I didn't like this more. Now, it could be me &/or my ingredients at fault (hence the 3* rating), but I found the balsamic overpowers some of the milder flavours. I'm going to remember what I do like about this recipe and experiment with a few other recipes. Thanks for posting.

Magnificent ! Better than any restaurant  or store bought, because you can add more or less ingredients to your preference. I leave out the balsamic sometimes. It is good with or without it.

I did not care for this recipe. We love garlic, but even with only two cloves of grated garlic, it was too much garlic. If it were roasted garlic it might be ok, but the flavors were all wrong.

This wasn't what I was looking for. It was a little tangy (even for me and I LOVE all things vinegar.).  It wasn't horrible though.

I was eating leftovers from Carabba's and i just wanted a little something for the bread. I decreased the recipe to 1/4 and it was fantastic! I ran out of garlic but even with that ommited this was very flavorful. I can't wait to make this with dinner for the family! It's in my recipe box now!

Excellent!  I have been using the same dipping sauce for years, and I decided to switch it up with this recipe.  My boyfriend glared at me when I said I was trying something different, but once he tasted it, he loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly, except using 4 cloved of garlic instead of 5.  It was great!! Thanks!

I have to say this is now one of my favorite recipes. This is so easy to make, most people probably have all the ingredients right in their pantry, and it whips up in minutes. It was definitely a crowd pleaser. I made the recipe exactly as it was written, then after dinner, added another 1/4 cup of oil and 2 TB of balsamic vinegar as there was a lot of the other ingredients remaining. The second time around batch was as great as the first. Delicious!

Served to a group of high schoolers, and received yummy feedback from all.  I usually don't care for olive oil dipping sauces, but this recipe changed my thinking on that!  Fabulous!  I used freshly grated parmesan is an added touch.  And pretty on the plate when done as recipe states.

I'm giving this 4 stars because my husband loved it, but I didn't find it to be anything special. I have to say not to make the mistake of refrigerating it if you make it ahead of time. It turned into a big gloppy mess. Adding more oil seemed to help it though. My husband said it tasted as good as in a restaurant. I think it's good enough, just a matter of personal preference.

This is really good.  The only change I made was using fresh oregano.  Fresh herbs totally change the flavor if you have them on hand.

VERY good dip.  I only made some minor changes; used more oil and omitted the vinegar. I used about 3/4 cup of olive oil as 1/4 did not seem like enough. Since I used more oil, I used all of the garlic.  The first time I made it, my husband didn't like the vinegar taste. The next time I omitted the vinegar and he loved it.

I thought that this had way too much balsamic vinegar in it; next time I make it I will probably only use 1/2 tbsp. I only had three cloves of garlic so that is all I used and I thought that was plenty. Overall though this recipe is a keeper.

I made it mostly according to the recipe.  I used garlic cloves from a jar and added some ground sea salt with the ground pepper on top.  It was an outstanding way to use some homemade bread we had on  hand.

We have a little local Italian restaurant here in town. The owner moved here from Italy and started the restaurant. They make a bread dip that tastes almost exactly like this! I LOVE this dip!

There used to be an Italian restaurant near to my aunt's house that served a "bread dip" as a appetizer. The restaurant sadly closed down due to the bad economy, which led me to google "Italian bread dip".
This is the recipe I found.
I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I made it just the way it is, all though I sometimes add red pepper flakes or cut back on the garlic. 
It's sinfully delicious with my mom's home-made white bread.

This was good. I liked it, and my husband loved it. To my surprise I found it a little plain. I may try it with a little less oil next time and see if that doesn't concentrate the flavor a little bit.

I really liked this dipping sauce. Especially with a good rustic bread.  Next time i will make with three cloves of garlic and one tablespoon of the balsamic vinegar,  then add some kosher salt. I'll also try it with gorgonzola cheese. Yum!

Changed NOTHING. It was very, extremely, awesome! The man, who never eats bread before a dinner, gobbled the whole thing up with bread and asked for seconds before the entree! AMAZING! Do balsamic to taste.

Delicious!  I omitted the balsamic vinegar and added red pepper flakes. Brought this to New Year's Day dinner and as requested I am sending the link to many of my family members! Thanks for the recipe Jill!

Waaaay too garlicky for me, but this recipe has potential.  I will try cutting the oregano back to 1 teaspoon, maybe even substituting it with Italian herb blend and omitting the garlic completely (I'm not a garlic fan anyway) to enjoy the fruity oil more.  As written, unfortunately it's not for me.

Very good recipe- only changed a few things: only one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar (which was more than enough) and garlic powder (no garlic gloves on hand). Still seemed a bit strong/bitter, but still pretty good.

The guys really liked this the other night. The flavor was great, just like at a favorite restaurant we go to. Next time, I will have to double the bread on the table because it was gone in a flash!!

I used minced garlic so maybe that's why it didn't come out as good as it should've...It was just way too much garlic for me though. Thanks for the recipe all in all!
