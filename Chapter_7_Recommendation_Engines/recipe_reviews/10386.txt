appropriate to make today since it is snowing out.  I must say I have tried several recipes on here w/the same concept of rolling dough made from cake mix in 10x sugar and these by far are the prettiest with the best effect.  I used a D.H. dark chocolate fudge mix.  **TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE WANTING TO MAKE THESE...IF U BUY AN 8OZ CONTAINER OF COOLWHIP AND REMOVE 3/4 CUP....DUMP THE REST IN THE BOWL...THAT IS EXACTLY 2 1/4 CUPS**  It makes it easier to use a cookie scoop and just remove them into the bowl of 10x sugar and roll around.  No sticky fingers.  I didn't refrigerate dough at all.  Very attractive cookie.  They taste soft and chewy like a brownie almost.

These are less like cookies and more like bites of chocolate cake. I always read the reviews before I make a recipe and in this case I am so glad I did. The batter is definitely sticky and I burned up my hand mixer and had to finish mixing by hand. Very difficult. Another reviewer suggested dusting your hands with confectioners sugar to prevent the batter from sticking to them. That was invaluable advice because, again, the batter is very sticky. I would not go through the trouble of making these cookies again. If I want chocolate cake bites I will simply make a chocolate cake.

Everyone I know loves these cookies!  Most asked for christmas cookie that I make.  I make them one batch at a time because the batter is so sticky, and I've burnt out a couple of handmixers because I tried to rush it.. I also stopped using handmixers with this.. lol!  My favorite is using Lemon Cake Mix.   Tip for fluffier cookies: Use cold Cool Whip out of the fridge, I found out that if I used warmer Cool Whip the cookies turned out flatter and not as chewy.

Awesome and so easy!  Yes they are a bit hard to handle but I used a tablespoon to gather the dough which after I molded each cookie in the tablespoon,  I dipped it back into the powdered sugar after each cookie.  I also coated my fingers with the powdered sugar. No problems after that!  Delicious!

This recipe is quick and easy, but even more important, it makes an exceptionally good cookie.  I like them even better after they have been sitting overnight.  I made two batches (1 lemon with almonds, 1 chocolate with milk chocolate chips and walnuts) and it only took 1 1/2 hours from start to finish (including clean-up) Even after sitting for a week, the last cookie was as good as the first.  This Christmas for the neighborhood cookie exchange I plan on making a selection of variations - in addition to the two listed above, I will also do orange with pecans, white with crushed peppermints, and spice with raisins.  I plan on having fun with this recipe!

I didn't have enough whipped topping so I substituted a cup of plain lowfat yogurt for the extra cup of whipped topping. I thought they turned out really good.

These were a good cookie and definately went fast. It helped to put the dough in the fridge before working. Lightly dusting your fingers with powdered sugar prevented sticking to. Next, I'm going to try it with a lemon cake mix.

Very good recipe.  The review right before mine suggested white cake with crushed peppermint.  DO NOT TRY THIS!  I did.  The candy melts and then get hard again as it cools.  It makes a huge mess.  I did try the chocolate & am going to try carrot cake with walnuts today.  Very easy recipe.

Pretty easy to make. You must refridgrate dough or else you have a huge mess on your hands, Also use Pam or some kind of spray to prevent sticking to hands. I loved the fact that I had all the ingredients on hand too. My 2 year old son helped me make these. He thought he was an awesome baker.

I used double chocolate fudge cake mix instead and had rave reviews last year. With requests for them already this year I think I'll have to make 2 batches!!

While I thought these were "okay", a lot of other people really enjoyed them.  I did not really like making them as the batter was SO stiff!  My arm was aching trying to mix this stuff!

The Pros: Good flavor, simple recipe, inexpensive handy ingredients.  The Cons: the texture is a little odd.  I found these to be a bit chewy and "marshmallow-y."   All in all good in a pinch, but not the best ever.

These were very yummy.  The only complaint that I may have is that they weren't as chewy as I would've liked them to be.  I was hoping for a more brownie like consistancy, but mine came out more cake like.  Maybe next time I would opt for a brownie mix instead of a cake mix.

Family liked these and they're so easy!  We used the 15.25 oz. Holiday Fun-fetti cake mix and they looked so pretty!  Removed 3/4 from an 8 oz. cool whip container and used the rest as someone else suggested.

I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening, and these turned out all right.  I cooked them for 9 minutes instead of 10, as another reviewer suggested. I used devil's food cake mix, but it just wasn't sweet enough for a cookie.

These cookies were awesome!!  Being a diabetic I chose to use a devil's food cake and added sugar-free instant chocolate pudding.  I also included 1/2 c. of chopped walnuts and used fat-free Cool Whip.  I made a thumbprint in the top of some of the cookies and added a chocolate chip before baking.  I also made some of the cookies with a Rolo caramel rolled in the middle.  I took the advice of a previous individual and sprayed a small amount of PAM on my hands before rolling the dough.  This made for much less stickiness.  I will definitely put this recipe in my favorites.  Thanks Samantha.

These cookies were a total hit--I did improvise a tiny bit, though: I bought devil's food cake without the pudding and threw in a box of chocolate pudding and I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the mix.  The preparation was a mess, comments on the stickiness of the batter were definitely true, but it was totally worth it and I will certainly make them again!

The dough is goopy but when dropped into confectionary sugar and rolled over isn't sticky any   more. My 7 and 2 year old loved making them and even more eating them! Definitly a new family favorite. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

What an easy recipe! Had limited time & guests on the way. I experimented with recipe as listed (great) and tried rolling in cocoa powder & rolling in finely chopped pecans. I also added choc chips and 1 Tbl espresso powder. Fav was pecans. Very nice! Left them a little "undercooked" and they came out fine. They look a bit undercooked when done. perfectly light, crisp & chewy. All varieties were eaten before I could get a pic. Prettiest were powdered sugar, then pecan...then cocoa. All delish!

Made to recipe.  They are good but need more chocolate flavor.  Think I'll try a tablespoon of cocoa next time.

I read this recipe yesterday and decided that I'd make them this morning before work, but had forgotten to bring the recipe home with me...so I used what I thought were the correct ingredients.  I forgot the egg and used an 8 oz container of whip cream, and what are chocolate cookies without chocolate chips, so I added a bag of those as well.  I used a cookie scoop (a must for these as far as I'm concerned) and they turned out fabulous!  A couple of folks here at work refuse to believe I didn't buy them at the bakery.  And by the way, when people comment on the sticky batter...its an understatement.  It's VERY STICKY, but so worth it.

These were quick and easy, but kind of bland. Cake mix doesn't make for a very flavorful cookie in general. I added some peppermint extract and that made them pop! Dough is very very sticky, I used a mini ice cream scoop and that helped. Do not omit the powdered sugar step, or you'll never be able to handle the dough balls!

These are awesome! I had to watch them very carefully though because my oven cooks really hot. A nice chewy cookie, that look so pretty. I can't wait to try them with different cake flavours, maybe a cherry. I get them all to myself because my husband is not a huge fan of cookies. Oh well. I am trying to eat them slow. 
Next time I will use the light whipped topping.

I used a 1-inch cookie dough scoop, which made dealing with the very sticky dough simple. It also had the advantage of ensuring that the cookies were pretty much all the same size. Easy and delicious. Will make these often!

Very good and easy.  When they say that the dough is sticky it is very sticky.  Will make again.

This is quick and easy but not my favorite cookie. I would make it again because it is so easy to make but only as a quick treat.

Super easy and tasty. I used lemon cake mix instead of chocolate. No other changes. Be sure to put powdered sugar on your hands when rolling.

I made this @ work for our cookie swap and it was a complete hit. I'm not a baker although I love to cook and try new things. My 17 yr old commented me on these cookies looks like I will be making these from here on out. Kudos for this recipe !!!!!

Very good cookie to make when you are pressed for time. Sticky it is, but worth it. They will stay for weeks in an air tight container. Friends at work loved them. Will try other mixes!

Be sure that your cake mix does not have any lumps. Sifting the dry cake mix prior to adding other ingredients would solve this problem. Otherwise, it is very difficult to get a smooth mixture. Great taste and so easy. Don't worry about the stickiness of the dough. Once your hands have confectioners sugar on them, the dough will not stick.

These are delicious, and very low fat.  They satisfy a chocolate craving, without making you feel guilty!!  They're great!!!  The dough is gooey, and a little hard to work with, but otherwise these are really quick and easy.

These were wonderful!  I added a cup of finely chopped pecans because I'm a nut freak.  They are even better the next day if they last that long.

It certainly doesn't get any easier than this! I was a little concerned by how dry the mix was, despite having read the reviews that warned me (I thought - "surely, this is not going to turn out well")...I tried using a scoop as one reviewer recommended, but it didn't work for me. I ended up refrigerating the dough between rolling a few balls out, and that seemed to work best. These are immensely addictive if you like soft, chewy cookies.

There is nothing better than a cookie recipe that only uses one bowl and ingredients you already have. Except of course one that your family also loves. I made these for the first time yesterday and we only have about 5 cookies left. Both my daughter (not normally a cookie eater)and my husband have already asked me to make more. The great part is, they are so easy I agreed to make another batch tomorrow!!  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!

This is fabulous!  The cookies are really soft and delicious.  Definitely do not overcook them.  11 minutes worked perfect for me.  I can't wait to try the other cake mixes.  The ingredients couldn't be easier, however, the dough was tough to work with.  Still, a very neat recipe.  Thanks!
