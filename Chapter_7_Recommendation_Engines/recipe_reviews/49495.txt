This recipe is wonderful!!!  It is just like the spread that we had at the Texas Roadhouse Restaurant.  I made this at Christmas and put it into small "glad ware" reusable containers and gave these out as Christmas gifts.  I have been asked for this recipe more than any other!  My kids and husband beg me to make more when we run out.  This is highly recommended!!!

I cut this recipe in half and took another reviewer's suggestion and used pumpkin pie spice instead of ground cinnamon. I spread this over homemade "freezer" waffles. Holy frijoles, is this GOOD! The kids um-nomed all through breakfast and asked for more.

Wonderful recipe! I cut it in half to give it a try and am glad I did - but instead of using the full amount of confectioners' sugar I used only 2 Tbsp. I also added a splash of vanilla. This was great on cinnamon raisin bagels but I can definitely see many uses for this!

Excellent! I took a honey butter recipe from this site that was 1/2c butter to 1/3c honey. I used what was leftover from the other night and therefore, only added 1/3c confectioner's sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. OHHHHH GOOOD!!! I served this with popovers this evening and when those were gone, I still had the craving for this and made some toast.  This is awesome!! I can't decide which I like better...honey butter OR honey butter WITH cinnamon (and sugar). Both delicious and melt in your mouth! Thanks Karena!!

This was soooo good.  I made biscuits for breakfast and was running low on jelly.  My picky 4 year old loved this.  I added a splash of vanilla extract...I usually do that when I make honey butter.  This was the first time I've tried adding cinnamon, and it tasted great!!  Can't wait to try this on pancakes.  Thanks Karena.

I love butter, so I knew I'd love this recipe!  I decreased the sugar and honey to about 1/4 cup each.  I served it with freshly baked bread and it's really, really yummy!  I'd definitely try this spread on the typical toast and bagels and I also think it would be great in oatmeal.

I found this to be much tooooo sweet for my liking, and I usually have a VERY high tolerance level for sweets :)  But maybe that's just because I used Manuka Honey from New Zealand, which is extremely rich and VERY concentrated with sugar. The sweetness completely overpowered the cinnamon and butter...I'm sure that if I'd used a different honey, the result would have turned out more pleasing to my taste buds.  Personally, I don't recommend using it on waffles or pancakes because it's more of a spread than a syrup.

Sweet (maybe a little too sweet)and delicious. Great on any bread, rolls etc.   Not very pretty for gift giving, though. It's a brown color, from the cinnamon. I like the honey butter recipe from this site better.

This was wonderful on our cinnamon raisin bagels this morning! Nice way to start the day. This could also be a good spread for cinnamon rolls just out of the oven. No need for powdered sugar glaze. Great recipe Karena.

WELL I MUST SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL AND SO EASY AND QUICK TO MAKE.  JUST WHAT YA NEED TO SPICE UP THOSE ROLLS OR BISCUTS....GREAT JOB THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!!! DIFFENTLY WILL KEEP IN MY RECIPE BOX WITH THE OTHER RECIPES FROM THIS SITE.  I WOULD THOUGH LIKE TO MENTION THIS.....FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T LIKE IT AND WROTE A POOR REVIEW IF YOU DISLIKE SOMETHING SO MUCH WHY DOWN GRADE SOMEONE'S RECIPE!!  JUST KEEP IT TO YOURSELF AND MAKE NO REPLY.  FOR THOSE WHO'S DIDN'T TURN OUT WELL ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU JUST DON'T READ DIRECTIONS OR YOU JUST CAN'T COOK.  BUT MY PERSONAL OPINION IS IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT SOMEONE'S RECIPE THEN DON'T POST ANYTHING BEING RUDE SHOWS YOUR IGNORANCE.......THANK YOU....WVGIRL41

This tastes very good!  I would recommend using margarine or tub spread though.  I used regular sweet cream butter and it gets really stiff when refrigerated.  So I will def use a softer type butter/margarine next time!

What can I say but absolutely fabulous!  Put this on the old fashioned pancakes recipe from this site (another fabo recipe) and my five year old couldn't stop licking his lips all through dinner.  Can't wait to try it on english muffins, in oatmeal, on a bagel, oh the possibilities are endless.  Yes, it is very sweet, but in a smooth honey sort of way.

This would have been way too sweet, at least for me, if prepared as written.  I eliminated the sugar entirely and it was perfect.  The cinnamon truly made this special.  I made this to spread on bagels, but I can only imagine how delicious this would be on warm, toasted French or Ciabatta bread.

CAUTION: very sweet! I only added 1/4 c. honey & 1/4 c. powdered sugar and it came out perfectly light and fluffy without being overly sweet.

I served this with Christmas dinner that included baked sweet potatoes. Our family's picky eater (an adult) not only ate her potato, but put this on her seasoned turkey, green beans and rolls. She had a clean plate. First time ever! Leftover butter was put on pancakes the next day.

It tasetes nothing like the butters at steakhouses like some reviewers mentioned.  It oozes honey, literally, the honey seperates and oozes.  The honey taste totally overpowers everything else.  I gave one star incase you are looking for a flavored honey, but this does not come out like a 'butter' at all.

I love the 4 ingredient simplicity of this recipe. Without meaning to be critical, I was surprised to read  how some reviewers commented that it was "too sweet" Of course it's going to be sweet. This recipe halves well. (Good if you want to pace yourself.) A small amount spread on toast is still delicious tasting. If you really love it, indulge not too often and use just a little.  Enjoy in Moderation!

So yummy!!  I did double to 2 sticks of butter and left the powdered sugar and honey the same, but doubled the cinnamon amount.  Also added a good dash of vanilla!  Cannot wait to serve this Christmas day!!

I LOVE this recipe.  It is good on just about any breakfast bread, waffle, pancake, muffin, etc.  I make it any time I want to dress up breakfast a bit.  It brings raves at church brunches and such.  Yum!

Great concept, but I think the ratios are way off. I did half the honey and none of the sugar and it was still sweet enough. Also, I like the idea of the pumpkin pie spice, so I tried that and it was great!

Easy to make!  My family thought this was amazing on white toast.  On a biscuit was a bit too heavy.  Saves well in the fridge.

We ate at Texas Roadhouse a couple of days ago, and my son requested that I try to duplicate their honey butter spread.  I saw that a couple reviewers thought this was like TR's so I decided to try it.  However, it was way too sweet, more like syrup.  TR's is fluffy, lighter and paler.  So I threw in another stick of butter (1/2 c.), and it was closer, then I threw in another stick of butter (1/2 c.) and it was perfect.  I'm going with 4 stars because as written, I'm sure it would be great if you were putting it on pancakes in place of syrup or something like that.

I have been looking everywhere for a homemade recipe for Cinnamon Honey Butter similar to the way my mom used to make it and found this one. IT IS EXCELLENT!!! Tastes just like the one my mom used to make! Also, it's quick and a no brainer to put together! Thanks! :)

This recipe is delicious.  I probably added more cinnamon than the recipe called for because I like the taste so much. We ate it on whole wheat bagels--and it was terrific.  I will definitely make again. Thanks!

I've made this more times than I can count and it is always such a hit. I always keep some in the fridge for those days when I don't want to cook breakfast, but still want something yummy. It can be a little sweet, but if you have a high tolerance for sugar like I do then you'll adore this.

I am giving this five stars for the ease of preparation and the taste. It was really easy and delicious. However, I used margarine. Don't. I highly recomend butter. With margarine it simply got runny rather than fluffy. I have a feeling using real butter will make all the difference.

Delicious!  I used 1 cup of butter and then left the honey & powdered sugar as directed.  I also added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!

We LOVED this! It was great on fresh,warm, homemade bread. Heck, I'd even lick it off a dirty spoon. Thanks so much- I've made it at least a dozen times, and each time it tastes amazing.

This was a very tasty recipe once I doubled the butter.  As written, the recipe has an equal ratio of honey to butter, which results in a very strong honey flavor.  I also at least doubled the cinnamon, if not even more than that, once I added the extra stick of butter.  But I think this recipe depends entirely on your personal taste, and I was very glad to find it, as I was looking for something similar to the cinnamon butter at a local bread store.  Once I doubled the butter and cinnamon, it was pretty close.  Thanks, Karena!

Awesome on a warm freshly made english muffin!  I am not a huge fan of sweets so I did cut the honey and sugar in half, but kept the cinnamon and butter as directed in the recipe.  Everyone in the house was pleased with this treat.

I would add half the amount of confectioner's sugar this recipe calls for (1/4 c vs. 1/2). As the recipe stands, you can tastethe sugar too distinctly, even after blended. Additionally, I would probably add a little less honey as well. I think overall, with these tweaks, this recipe will be delicious.

I reduced the sugar a little and the honey to 1/4 cup, and I used pumpkin pie spice as others suggested. 
It tasted awesome! It certainly didn't need to be any sweeter; it was very good on yeast rolls. Several of my guests commented on it and one said it was really good on the ham, too.  However, it had a very strange texture after being in the fridge for two days.  I stirred it and let it sit out on the counter for awhile, but it still wasn't especially smooth.  Good, but I maybe wouldn't make it until a few hours before serving next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband liked the cinnamon butter served at a local steak house, so I began a search. This is what popped up, so I made it. I really didn't expect it to knock my socks off, but boy was I wrong! This is delicious! I served it with homemade rolls, and my hubby actually liked it better than the steak house! Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make this again!

This recipe needs a little tweaking to work properly. Made according to the recipe, the mixture is the consistency of molasses. Next time I'll try 1/3 cup each of sugar and honey to make a more buttery consistency. Fantastic flavor!

Waaayy too sweet as is. Changed proportions to 1 cup butter, 1/2 cup honey, and a few spoonfuls confectioners, 1 tsp cinnamon. Delicious on Cathy's Banana bread from this site! It is to die for!

My husband loved this! Just like the butter from Texas Roadhouse.  I whipped the butter so it was nice and fluffy, and I probably used a little less honey because I didn't have enough. Turned out wonderful anyway! Now I just need a great dinner roll to go with it.

I saw this mentioned on the Popover recipe here, and knew I had to try it! It is SO good! I also adjusted the ingredients as follows: 1/2 cup butter, softened,  1/3 cup confectioners' sugar,  1/4 cup honey,  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon.  It comes out smooth as silk, yum!

This was great, sweet but great. I ran out of cinnamon so I used pumpkin spice instead and the extra flavors went great with the honey. We use this on toasted banana bread.

This recipe has too much honey in it.  The honey overpowers the cinnamon and causes the spread to be extrememly runny.

I tried this and it is excellent!  It is very sweet, so next time I may reduce the sweetness to my taste.  I like butter with a hint of sweetness to it.  I served this on the Banana Sour Cream Bread on the site.  I did use margarine with vegetable oil in it and it made it curdle slightly and didnt look to pretty.  So next time Ill make sure to use regular butter so it wont be like that.  This is definately a keeper!

This recipe was ok.  I tasted mostly honey, not butter.  I would cut back on the honey and sugar.  Didn't really pick up the cinnamon flavor either. Might try again with alterations. It was nice on the AR Fluffy Whole Wheat Biscuits though.  It helped because the buscuits were so so.

WONDERFUL! The only thing I measured was the butter (since it comes in sticks!) but the combination was incredible. If guessing, I would say I used about 1/4 c. powdered sugar and 1/4 c. honey. I just sprinkled in the cinnamon until I liked the color. I whipped this for several minutes in my stand mixer. It was FABULOUS on top of the apple strudel muffins on this site. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty, although the honey was a touch overpowering, I will probably halve it next time.  I will definitely make this one again, it was a hit with freezer wheat dinner rolls!

Very good recipe. Livens up ordinary dinner rolls. I piped this into a festive dish for a holiday party and it looks very pretty. Also tastes good with a pinch of nutmeg and ginger. Only used 1/4 c honey and 1/4 c sugar, because I wanted to bring out the spice flavor more. Very good stuff!

We love the rolls and whipped cinnamon butter from Texas Roadhouse restaurant. On a whim the other day I made the recipe for Grandma Rita's Soft Butter rolls. My husband bit into one and commented that they tasted like the rolls from Texas Roadhouse. So I immediately went on the hunt to recreate the whipped cinnamon butter too. I came across this recipe and whipped up a batch, it came out great! They aren't an exact replica of the rolls and butter from Texas Roadhouse but it's pretty close and very delicious on warm in rolls. I can't wait to try it on other breads and muffins.

The look of this butter is a little weird, but  I LOVE the taste. I used cinnamon and not pumpkin spice seasoning like other suggested, and it was still yummy.

This recipe is delicious!  I used only 2 T of honey AND 2 T of the confectioner's sugar.  We ate it on top of pumpkin pancakes, but will be making rolls, bread, and anything else I can think of to put this delightful concoction on!

Whew! This is pretty good, but a bit too much honey for my tastes. My boyfriend made this and he and his family loved it. Made some with pumpkin pie spice and some with cinnamon.. I couldn't really taste either with so much honey :( Will make again but with less honey.

I made a loaf of bread yesterday and made the Cinnamon Honey Butter.  It was great.  My husband wants me to make some and another loaf of bread today so he can take it to work.  My granddaughter ate it on her waffles this morning...will always keep on hand.

This recipe is easy & delish!  I made it the 1st time as instructed.  I love the Texas Roadhouse honey butter, so that is the taste & consistency I was looking for.  This was close but a bit too sweet & the consistency was almost "frosting-like."  The next time I made it, I used half the amount of confectioners' sugar.  It was perfect!  Just like Texas Roadhouse.  Goes great with cornbread too!

Absolutely delicious!  Did you know you can leave butter out of the refrigerator for 30 days without it spoiling?  I just left a stick of butter on my countertop all day long, and prepared some rolls from the frozen yeast roll dough you can buy at the grocery store.  Right before dinner, I mixed this up and we had rolls and cinnamon honey butter before dinner just like you do at the restaurant!  It is soft and easy to spread so you can slather it on thickly if you like.  I highly recommend this, and may buy some of those tiny canning jars and fill them with this butter for Christmas presents.

This is so good! I love the combination of flavors, but I did change the recipe a little....I didn't want it to be as sweet. I used 1 cup butter; 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar; 1/4 cup honey and 2 tsp. cinnamon...perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

Holy honey. Next time I will cut the honey in half or more. I will also add vanilla. Someone said this tastes like TX roadhouse butter, but I do not think it even comes close.

Based on the reviews, I tweaked this recipe to make gifts for my children's teachers.  I used 1/2 c. honey, 1/2 c. confectioner's sugar, and 4 tsp. cinnamon for 1 lb. of unsalted butter.  I think the ratio of sweet to butter is much better than what the original recipe calls for.

Wow! This is sooo good.. Watch out or you're going to find yourself spreading it on anything you can! I used it on the Popovers (also found on this site) and the combo was perfect together.

The consistency is not like butter, but more like a thick sauce. I followed the recipe exactly, but it really just tasted so strong of honey, I added another stick of butter and another teaspoon of cinnamon. I might end up modifying it even more... we'll see how the family likes it on homemade bread.

Wow! this stuff is addicting. I too used pumpkin pie seasoning and added extra cinnmon on top of that. The consistency wasn't great just mixing with a spoon-even after using room temp butter, but the electric mixer made this light and fluffy and delicious! So far we've put this on dinner rolls,bagels,biscuits,cinnamon raisin bread, and banana bread. Whoever came up with this recipe should seriously be rewarded =)

Like many other reviewers noted, it was much too sweet. Overall though, the taste was good. I want to try it again but next time with more butter and much less sugar. The honey I used was already very sweet. It seems that the result of this recipe is highly dependent on the honey used.

This was a good recipe. Since I didn't want it too sweet, I omitted the powdered sugar and just used the butter, honey and cinnamon. My boys said it tasted just like the Texas Roadhouse. On my next batch, I am going to use a little less honey, though. I will definitely make this again!

LOVED IT! I was looking for something similar to the honey butter served at most Roadhouses and this was perfect! I did add a tsp of vanilla after seeing it in some of the other reviews and I think that helped in making it so good! I am sure I will most likely always have this sitting in the fridge ready. Thanks!

This butter was fairly good, and I may make it again someday, but I'll cut the confectioners' sugar back by half -- I found it to be a little overwhelming.  (Or, maybe I couldn't get past the fact that it felt like I was eating icing.)

Wow!  This is the first time I've ever eaten or made honey butter, but it certainly won't be my last!  This is truly delicious.  I only added half the confectioners sugar and, I say this as someone who LOVES sweets, I honestly don't think you need it at all - even with half added, it's heading down the 'sickly sweet' road.  Oh, also added a smidgen of nutmeg and allspice.  Absolutely amazing.

This is delicious on toast, poundcake, pancakes, and muffins.  It is a little on the thin side though.  When I make this again, I would like to add a little more butter or a little less honey for a thicker consistency.

Yum! This Butter was delicious. I made it as written but then added more butter to help thicken it and cut down on the sweetness a little.  If this is your first time making it I would suggest making it as written and then change it to suit your needs. YUM!

How perfect-looked for a recipe to replicate the awesome butter on the Texas Roadhouse buns, and this is it! Use cinnamon, not pumpkin spice if thats the flavor you want-deeeelicious!  Great on any kind of bun/bread, but slightly warmed is definitely best.  Goes great, oddly, with steak!

YUM! I used this on cinnamon belgian waffles recipe - it would be great on so many things! I'd really recommend using a mixer and actually whipping the ingredients. I just mixed with a spoon (since I did it randomly while waiting for the waffles to finish) and it separated. I'll use this again though for lots of things! Honey and butter are wonderful together--and the cinnamon gives it just enough spice! You won't be disappointed!

Good, but very, very sweet.  (And I love sweet!)  On the second batch, I adjusted it a bit: same butter amount, 1/4 cup honey, 1/3 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Turned out fantastic second time around.

I only gave 4 stars because I had to change the recipe. The first time I made it as-is and it was waaay too runny. I re-made it using the tips from others and it came out great! I used: one cup butter, 1/4 cup confectioners sugar, 2 Tbsp honey, and about 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. It kept the consistency of butter and wasn't too sweet. I'll defintely make it again!

way too sweet!  you'd be better off starting with the butter and slowly adding a very small amount of the other ingredients at a time, tasting it as you go... once you add everything in there's no going back!

My review is 10 stars for my final outcome, but 4 stars for the recipe because it would not have had the consistency of butter if I would have added all the honey the recipe suggest!... I added about 2T honey and it was so wonderful on my pumpkin muffins!  I will definately make this during the holidays!!!  Yummy!!!!

Delicious! I used it on my homemade rolls and it was a huge hit for Sunday dinner.  The next morning we used it on pancakes. It made my pancakes a little sweeter than I normally have them but still really yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

I dont like giving a three  but this for me had waaaayy to much honey in it.  I made a second batch and just squirted in maybe a tablespoon or two of honey and added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and MAN-OH-MAN..I must have buttered up three sweet dinner rolls(from this site) in a five minute time frame.  So sweet, yummy and delicious.

Wow. I made this recipe to go on some pumpkin bread and my husband said he could eat the butter with a spoon, by itself! It was awesome. I will definitely be making this again!

This is really good, but I agree with others that the measurements are off.  If made to exact specifications, all I can taste is honey.  Needs more butter or less honey.  Either way, it is really yummy.

Mmmm.. this was absolutely DIVINE on cinnamon raisin bagels. I only used 1-2 tsp of powedered sugar (mainly b/c I didn't really like that powdery texture) and reduced the honey to a little over 1/4 cup (just keep adding until you reach the desired taste). I stored this in a small jelly jar, would look great for  a gift... thanks!!

My boys love this on baked yams.  It is similar to one used by a Texas steak house chain.  It's really great on anything we've used it on.

I found this recipe to be too sweet and its appearance was not that appetizing.
I started over and gradually adjusted the amount of confectioner’s sugar and honey until it suited my fancy. I ended up only using a few drops of honey and a few teaspoons of confectioner’s sugar.

This went really well in Claire's Crepes! It was also quite good on toast! But as good as it is, don't overload it or the bread gets mushy. Phenomonal on pancakes!!

Only used a tablespoon of the sugar because as I was tasting, it was certainly sweet enough with the honey. This was so good on a nice toasty corn muffin. YUM and thanks!

I was hoping for something like served at Texas Roadhouse Restaurant.  It was way too sweet, too much honey.  I added double the amount of butter and very, very good.  Make this adjustment and you will be very happy.

I made this with no powdered sugar (because I was out of it) and it was still really good.  I was trying to duplicate something I had on a baked sweet potato at a restaurant recently, and I was baking a sweet potato last night so I made this.  It was AWESOME!!  I love the taste.  It was a little pasty, but for what I use it for, I didn't care!  It all just melted together and tasted heavenly!

Excellent, but I  used two sticks of butter instead of one.  I think using all the sugar/honey with one stick of butter would be way too sweet.  I made this to go with homemade crescent rolls (also from this site) and it was a hit!

This is wonderful! The only thing I did different was added more cinnamon & cut back the honey. It was wonderful on homeade dinner rolls & has become a new staple in our house. Thanks for a great recipe!

Although a great mixture of ingredients, I thought that the end product was way too honey-sweet.  I made it a second time, and cut the sugar, cinnamon and honey amounts in half...WOW!  Just like the butter that you get in popular restaurants!

This was very good on my toast with a great spreadable texture. I expected more of a cinnamon toast taste but it didn't taste much different from plain honey. I think I'm going to try adding more cinnamon next time and a little less honey.

This recipe is simple yet awesome! I made it for some biscuits I made, and my family loved it! I did too. The honey stands out a bit more than all the ingredients, so I added a little less honey. I also made half the recipe and still had more than enough, but that's just my preference. It tastes amazing with everything!!! Definitely going to make again soon.

I made this with 2 TBS of honey and 2 TBS of powdered sugar and it was plenty sweet. 1/2 cup of each is unnecessary for 1/2 cup of butter.

It was very sweet. I made it with only 1/4 cup sugar and honey but it was still too sweet.. I added an extra stick of butter and it was great. Next time I will reduce sugar and honey to 1/8 cup of each.

I followed the recipe and thought the honey was too overpowering. I recommend cutting the honey in half to make it  1/4 cup, or maybe even 1/8 cup.

I adjusted to my taste, not big on honey. I cut the honey out completely, and since I was making a triple batch, I used 1/3 cup of powdered sugar  (1 cup total) per batch.  I received no complaints.

I took advice from others and used half the sweeteners and the pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  It's just the perfect sweetness for me, but I think next time I'm going to add more spice!  Such an easy gift!

This recipe is awsome, It reminds me of the spread they serve at Texas road house. I did not make any changes. I will make it again. Thank you for this  recipe.

I was nervous about making this (it sounded a little too sweet) but tried it anyway to make a topping for baked sweet potatoes. Made it exactly as written, and it was absolutely delicious! It has to be restirred whenever it's used, because the honey tends to separate from the rest of the mixture, but this one is definitely a keeper. Used the leftover butter on raisin toast... I may have to keep a supply of this butter on hand just for that. Thanks for an easy and very tasty recipe.

This was excellent and stores so well, but I did have to halve the sugar in order for it to still taste like butter. After that slight adaption, it's a five-star staple for sure!

It is very, very sweet, and doesn't taste much like honey.   I love sweets, but this was too much, it was more like frosting. 

 In fact, when taken out of the refrigerator it has the consistency of frosting, actually more like thick glue, and won't spread until it warms up (or melts onto a hot biscuit!)  

I didn't throw it out, but I won't make it again.  


 (I don't know if it's like TX Road House or not, because I've never had it)

Couple days ago was the second time I went to Texas road house and I remember how delicious their butter and rolls are, it's all I wanted to eat! I searched online for a recipe and found this one and gave it a try. However I used brown sugar instead.  AMAZING! I can't tell the difference. I hand whisked it for a long time to make it blended and fluffy. With an electric whisker would of taken a lot less time. I use it on almost everything. Especially warm Hawaiian rolls!

The was very good!  I did cut back a little on the honey and the powdered sugar but it tasted really good.  I made this to put on the rolls..  Dinner Rolls, FIve Ways recipe on another site. I saw reviews for those that said something was missing....this butter was just the thing.  A little sweetness but not too sweet!

Excellent!  I made a double batch for Christmas as we were expecting quite a few people. I used only half the sugar and honey since concentrated sugars are an issue for some of the guests, but it was still super delicious. I think it was sweet enough with half and I didn't feel cheated. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

When you decide to make this, be sure to look at the photos, that way, you can get an idea of the consistency. I thought the honey butter would be a bit more of a whipped texture, but it is quite smooth. I ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, and a dash more cinnamon.

This is pretty good. It is a bit sweet, so I'll try halving to powdered sugar next time. It is also a bit gritty due to the sugar. I used natural honey from a local orchard.

This recipe was truly amazing and very easy to make! The only change that i did was that i did the recipe to taste and it was wonderful. It has a smooth creamy texture and just a hint of cinnamon.

I thought this was OK. After making it, I decided that I prefer regular honey butter - I guess the powdered sugar made it too much like frosting. Also, I have to agree that the 1:1:1 ratio for butter:sugar:honey made it much too sweet. It really did taste like a super dense frosting. I added another 1/2 cup of butter to mellow it out, and that worked for my guests. While my guests enjoyed it (served it with Eggnog bread), they were not raving about it, like they do with the honey butter. Thanks for an interesting spin, but I'll stick with the classic.

I made this exactly to recipe.  It's very very sweet, but everyone raves about it.  I have tried it with less powdered sugar, also with pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, and lastly with a little vanilla extract on the last batch.  Each of the three other ways I tried it, none were near as good as the original.

Okay.... So I'm completely addicted to this butter!!!! Its absolutely delish on rolls!!!! Honey was a little overpowering .... So my second batch I cut the honey in half!!! Boy did that make a difference! I would have to say the second batch tasted almost exactly like Texas Roadhouse!!!! This will be in my fridge for years to come

I eliminated the powdered sugar and added a tiny bit of stevia.  I increased the cinnamon to 1-1/2 tsp.  I'm not a huge honey fan.  Next time I am going to use maple syrup.  It was great on sweet potatoes and the nut roll we had for Easter dinner.

Oh this is so good! I made this for Easter today to eat with potato rolls, and it was amazing. I was a bit worried about the sugar plus the honey, I thought it would be sickeningly sweet, but I was pleasantly surprised. 
I made the recipe as written, no changes at all.
I will make this over and over again.

So yummy!  It is great on everything from pancakes and waffles, to English muffins or dinner rolls.  I used a little less honey than the recipe called for, only because my family does not like strongly honey flavored anything.  I used just enough honey to get a faint hint of it and everyone raved about how great it was.

Can you use margarine? 
That's all I have. 
I made it with that, and it turned out curdled...
And "all" (Honey & margarine)were not expired. 
What butter is good for this? 
My mom always used to use Blue Bonnet Margarine, and it came out perfect. lol 
What happened to mine Mom? :( R.I.P.

It was delicious~ BUT. I highly recommend people to add a little less honey. I ended up having to add a little more butter and cinnamon. It tasted EXACTLY like the Texas Roadhouse Butter. DELICIOUS (:

The honey separated from the butter and ended up looking kind of gross. This was also too sweet for us.  We played around with the amounts and found that we really liked it much better with just a drizzle of honey.

This was very good the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I thought it was a little too much cinnamon I think 1/2 teaspoon would be better. Other then that its very yummy.
Thanks!

This was a good substitute for the T. Roadhouse butter. I made as written, it didn't seem to hit the spot like I wanted but it was a good spread though.

Great recipe.  I "discovered" a tub of Land O Lakes cinnamon butter at my local grocery store and tried it.  Very good.  But when I ran out, I thought to look up the recipe on Allrecipes and voila!  Sure you may need to tweak it to your liking.  I used 1/2 cup butter, 1/3 cup honey, 1/3 cup confectioners sugar and two teaspoons of cinnamon.  Tasted and looked just like the store bought with almost the same consistency.  I even saved the original tub I bought and reused that to store my new love.

Made as stated, this recipe is very runny and horrifically sweet. I had to remove half of the bowl and then add one additional stick of softened butter to what remained. This made a very good butter. So, I think my advice would be to double the butter and cut in half all remaining ingredients. Not my favorite recipe - it took way too much tweaking.

Wow! This recipe is soo good, everyone ranted about how good it was, and was super easy! Next time however, I think i'll use half the amount of honey, for the taste was very prominent. Otherwise I was soo happy with this recipe, It was amazing :D

We thought this was FABULOUS as the recipe calls for!!! My 5 stars are for the recipe as is. Me adding pumpkin spice was just a nice twist to an already fabulous recipe. I think the cinnamon and pumpkin spice compliment each other.

Outstanding.  Made it to go with the popovers by J Miller also from this site.  Fantastic pairing!  I did take the advice of another reviewer and use pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon.  This is a keeper.

So far I have only tried this on toast, but it is amazing!  Next time, though, I think I will cut the confectioner sugar in half.  I really think it is sweeter than it needs to be.  Excellent recipe, though.  The cinnamon is the ticket!

Really good. Next time I may reduce the sugar, cinnamon and honey just a bit for a more subtle sweetness.

YUMMY...Will definately keep this one in the fridge.  Tastes like the butter from Country Crock, but its hard to find in the store.  Great on corn bread, biscuits, and banana bread. This is a keeper!!! Thanks.

This was good but tasted much more like an icing than butter.  It would be good for cinnamon rolls.  I think the sugar and honey were too overpowering of the butter.

FANTASTIC!!  My mom got us cinncamon honey butter when we went camping in Canada, and I've wanted it again ever since.  I'm so happy I found this very simple recipe.  I can't wait to make it and package it up as Christmas gifts with homemade bread!

Real good.  I served it at thanksgiving for people to put on their sweet potatoes.  The kids were slathering it on the rolls and some people were putting in on the carrots.  I cut the sugar and honey in half and i'm glad i did.  I think the honey would have overpowered everything.

I wound up adding 3 extra Tbs of butter during the mixing process along with a lot more cinnamon. It was a huge hit though! Next time I might just tone done the amount of honey and confectioners' sugar used.

Tasty but next time I will do half the amount of honey and powdered sugar.  I LOVE sweets and this was just a little too sweet as is.  Was a very good companion to the recipe on this site for Louisiana Sweet Potato Pancakes.

This recipe is great without any changes, but if you think it's too sweet, than just add more butter. I added another 1/2 cup to the existing recipe and it cut down the sweetness, but not the flavor. Awesome!

This was just OK for me.  I used it on dinner rolls thinking it would recreate the Texas Roadhouse butter but it was no where close.  Too much honey.  If I make it again I will cut the honey in half.  Google "Texas Roadhouse Cinnamon Butter" and you will get a closer tasting version of their buter.

It was ok I guess, but when my friend and I tried it it had a really weird taste. We thought we put too much butter in, so we put more other ingredients in. It was getting better, but still not so good I'd eat it everyday.

OH SO GOOD!!!!  I took other's suggestions and cut back on the powdered sugar and honey.  Tastes like Texas Roadhouse Cinnamon Butter.  Can't wait to serve it with the Honey Bunny bread I purchased at Great Harvest Bread Co tomorrow.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was pretty good, and I was surprised at how close it came to this cinnamon butter used at a local restaurant.  The only thing I didn't like was that it tasted a little too sweet.  I'd probably cut back on the sugar a little.  Still delicious though.  UPDATE:  Tried this again, this time I only used about a tablespoon + 1 teaspoon of honey, 1/8 cup of confectioners sugar, and a little extra cinnamon.  I thought this tasted great; the butter is what shined through.  Just how I like it.  This is now a five!

This was ok, but it doesn't taste like the cinnamon butter from Texas Roadhouse, as suggested. I think this had too much honey and covered up the butter taste. Next time I would not add as much honey, if any at all.

Definitely 5 stars for the idea but 4 stars for the recipe itself. I did like a few other reviewers and reduced the honey to only half the amount listed and left everything else the same. I didn't add vanilla to it but I may try it next time. Overall this is a delicious butter but with the full amount of honey I think the taste would probably overpower the recipe (or it just may be the honey that I used which has a strong flavour) Just using half the amount of honey gave me a perfect balance of all the other flavours. Very good on pancakes or with soft rolls.

With a little bit of adjusting this was great! Even with half as much honey, it was still very thin, but the taste was just excellent!

Very good. Added slightly more than the required amount of vanilla. Perfect. Used it on the "Waffles I" recipe from this site and my husband was sad he couldn't have more of the butter because he was too full to have another waffle. This is the first recipe that HE declared a keeper!

This was really good. I was a little tired of having biscuits with butter so I was looking for an easy change, using what I already had on hand. 

This was definitely a great find. With a full 1/2 cup of honey and confectioner's sugar, it would have been way too sweet for me but I followed the suggestion of another member and halved them both to 1/4 cup each. 

The honey still had a very strong flavor so next time I will start with 2 tablespoons, taste and go from there.

Based on the reviews that it was too sweet, I only added 1/4c of powdered sugar and that was plenty for me.  I also added another 1/4c of butter because I used up all the honey I had left and it was slightly more than I need.  It was delicious on the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread and the Easy Morning Glory Muffins from this sight.  This morning we had it with our french toast and it was great too.  Thank you so much!

Very good....although I made it the way the recipe states and all I could taste was the honey. I added another stick of butter which made it much better.  Will definitely keep this on hand at all times.  Thanks!

As much as I love honey, I have to agree with some previous reviewers that there should be more butter & less honey. Still, it is delicious, and I enjoyed it on Banana Nut Yeast Bread, from this site.

I hosted a dinner party and served this butter along with biscuits.  I omitted the powdered sugar, used 1/4 cup honey and only 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I only wanted the butter to have a slight cinnamon flavor.  Everyone agreed this butter was fabulous!

This spread is delicious.  I served it with Pumpkin Waffles and the butter was the bigger hit!  I used 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/4 c honey and omitted the sugar.

OOOO this is so good!  This reminds me of store bought cinnamon spread I used to have when I was a kid.  I wouldn't advise doubling the butter as others had suggested though...it's plenty buttery enough.  I also doubled the cinnamon and halved the icing sugar but it could've used the whole amount.  YUMMY!!

SO so so yummy! I made this for my homemade bread for dinner tonight. My 3 yr old son LOVES it! Melt in your mouth delicious. I DID use 2 sticks instead of one and per husband's request added an extra tsp of cinnamon. Thanks so much for sharing.

I agree with others who said double the amount of butter (or decrease by half the amount of each sweetener).  With that change, the recipe was fabulous with the Cold Oven Popovers from this site for breakfast and a baked sweet potato with dinner.

A bit too sweet for me.  I'm a cinnamon lover..so I doubled the cinnamon (next time I'd still add more).  Everyone else loved it though. I also used low-fat Becel instead to lower the calorie and fat intake.

This butter got rave reviews at my dinner party, and it kept in my fridge for weeks.  I took the advice of others and doubled the amount of butter, and it was just what I wanted.  I'll definitely make it again.

THis recipe was really sweet.  I was looking for something to taste like the butter from Texas Roadhouse and this didn't quite live up to it.  I also had trouble keeping it in the refrigerator, the ingredients would seperate apart within a day.

Although I didn't really follow the recipe (I didn't use specific amounts, nor did I put any powdered sugar in it as its sweet enough with honey), I really liked this combination. One of my favorite restaurants serves this butter and I thought it just had cinnamon and sugar in it, but this matches it better. Yummy!

I thought this was waaaay too sweet. Maybe if it were put over a dessert or served for breakfast it would be okay but it just doesn't go with dinner. I even cut back on the honey and the sugar (to 1/3 c each) and it ended up tasting just like plain honey. I will probably try to make this again but use significantly less honey and sugar.

YUMMY! Get out the hot buns, muffins, toast, whatever from the oven and slather this all over! Sometimes I use a bit less sugar. This is awesome and tastes great on so many things. Addicting! This also is a great gift in a ziploc disposable plastic container with homemade muffins or such. Enjoy!

took this into work with mini bagels.  Everyone loved it and had to print out the recipe for them.  Thanks,
