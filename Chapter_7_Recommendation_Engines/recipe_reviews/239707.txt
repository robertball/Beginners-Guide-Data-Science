A Mary Poppins of recipes this one. I used it to make gravy for creamed chip beef on (gluten free) toast and it was nice and didn't steal the show too much. I then used it to make breaded veggies and a cutlet and liked it more. I made my own seasoning due to needing a no-sodium version so in the end I just added 4 Tbsp of my seasoning. Make sure the cornmeal is fine. Mine is course and after the gravy I decided to give this mix a spin in the blender and the cutlets and veggies came out less "sandy". Definitely a keeper flour blend for those times you need some kick. Thank you Gluten Free Jeannie for this nice blend!

MAGIC GRAVY!!  That's what my family is calling this recipe.  Since we've been gluten free for over a year I have been sadly disappointed in all the gravy alternatives I've tried.  (Although cornstarch make gravy look right, it use always missed something to be desired.)  This recipe has what I've been looking for in a gluten free gravy!  Flavor.  I used this mix in a bacon gravy that we smothered on hash browns and biscuits.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  Yes, we splurged on the bacon, but it was for Sunday brunch.  I have since tried this recipe with a basic beef gravy for mashed potatoes, and a chicken gravy for lemon thyme rice, and it was fabulous in both.  Thanks for submitting such an awesome recipe Jeannie.

I have tried every GF flour mix recipe I could find and none of them have worked as well as this one! I was raised on good old fashioned gravy and homemade hot biscuits and that's what I miss about being on a GF diet ( a life saving necessity for me!) It also makes a wonderful coating for baked chicken. Just add a bit more masa harina and  some grated parmesan cheese in the flour  coating dry mix and use milk for the liquid coating. YUM!
