loved this recipe!!  I did not use the mint or the sherry -  instead I added a slash of balsamic vinegar.   My Italian husband (whose mother is THE BEST COOK) loved this - as did all my guest.  I will make this again and again.  Very easy and YUMMMMMMMY!

This is our household favorite pasta dish! I always make it for guests, and everyone always wants the recipe. I read the other reviews, and don't let the cheese melting problem some people mention deter you from trying this delicious recipe. 
TIPS FOR GETTING THE CHEESE TO MELT:
1. Add cheese to pasta as soon as pasta is drained.
2. Use a stainless steel bowl when mixing the cheese with the pasta so the heat from the cooked pasta will be retained, aiding in a quicker melting process.
3. Use two forks and go back and forth in opposite directions right after adding the cheese. This helps to distribute the cheese more evenly.

I didn't have any fresh tomato's or basil, so I used 2 cans of the new Aylmers tomato's with olive oil and garlic and I used a TBSP of McCormicks Basil in a tube,otherwise followed the recipe as printed, the taste was wonderful.  I did not drain the canned tomato's but allowed the pasta to absorb the excess juice before I served it.  I also did not like the look of the cheese and found it made clean-up more difficult (the cheese really coated the forks etc), next time I am going to skip adding the cheese and just serve the pasta with a shaker of parmesan so that everyone can add their own at the table, also will have a shaker with red pepper flakes so that the teenagers can spice it up as much as they like.  I think the parmesan will be sufficient for us without the 2 1/2 cups of fontina and asiago which really add a lot of calories not to mention expense.

This pasta is incredible.  I made it for my mother over Christmas, and she went bonkers over it.  I used Angel Hair pasta and about 3 cups of shredded asiago & fontina cheese.  I also made the marinade and let it set the day before I made it.  TRY THIS RECIPE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.  I could live off of this stuff.

I did make alterations to the recipe to suit what I had on hand, but BOY oh boy was this delicious. Instead of the sherry, I used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar. I only had 1lb of Roma tomatoes, so I used a 14oz can of Italian style chopped tomatoes, which I added to the fresh ones after they marinated. I omitted the mint. Because the cheese this recipe calls for add so much fat and cost, I used about 1/2 to 1cup grated Parmesan. While the water for the pasta was boiling, I sauteed some red bell peppers, fresh baby spinach, white mushrooms, and zucchini to add when I mixed the noodles with the tomatoes. The veggies added a lot of flavor and textures. I found I had a lot of extra sauce/tomatoes with 12oz of pasta, so I cooked 16oz. I toasted some fresh bread, and it was almost like eating bruschetta with my pasta! My boyfriend loved it too. Highly recommended.

I really liked this a lot, but I also played with some ideas that turned our really well. I don't like fontina cheese, so I used all asiago, which was great. Also, tomatoes in our area aren't very good, so I used plum tomatoes instead: they worked really well and were so sweet! I also added broiled shrimp at the end. I took another person's tip and substituted balsalmic vinegar instead of sherry. The mint was a great, unexpected addition, though!

My biggest problem was that the cheese (probably the fontina) didn't melt well.  I kept tossing it but it ended up staying in some smaller "blobs."  That's OK on a pizza but I didn't like it in this dish.

Really good and so easy! Skipped the mint & the sherry.  Did use some lime juice and a little red wine vinegar.  Also used fresh parmesan and feta.  Chopped a little red onion in too.  Will make all summer with homegrown basil and tomatoes.

Possibly the best pasta sauce I have made or eaten.  It's that good.  I used tomatoes (about 4 medium) that we bought at the farmer's market in the morning, and basil and mint from my garden.  I like mint, but it can quickly overpower the other flavors, so I'd suggest chopping it very fine or skipping it. I didn't have cream sherry but added a splash of balsamic vinegar as another reviewer mentioned.  I made it about 2 hours before as directed.  After cooking the pasta, I tossed it with about 1/2 cup or so of shredded mozzarella and grated fresh parmesan over the top to serve since those were the cheeses I had on hand & I didn't think it needed so much.  I made some artisan bread with olive basil dipping sauce on the side, and we were too stuffed to finish.  I'm planning on serving the leftovers tomorrow as a side dish with some grilled chicken.  Delish!

We prepared this last night with grilled Italian Sausage and whole-wheat sourdough rubbed with garlic and olive oil drizzle then broiled. My husband said he thought we were at a high-end restaurant in Italy! It helps that we grow fresh herbs, too. The 2nd photo is my husbands' actual dinner plate.

I also used balsamic vinegar instead of cream sherry and would highly recommend that.  This recipe is super easy and is absolutely delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

This is heavenly!  I hate it when people change the recipe and then review it, but I am going to do it anyway.  I didn't have any sherry on hand, so I used an aged balsamic vinegar and this dish came out absolutely amazing!  It is a weeknight staple for my husband and I.  I use grape tomatoes, halved, because it's much easier.  Also, the fresh mint, basil, and garlic are key ingredients!

Super delicious Italian style! Garlic and herb flavors compliment this recipe. I followed the directions with the exception of sherry cooking wine instead or cream, and we used more garlic. This recipes does take a longer prep time because of the dicing and marinating the tomato mix. It is more expensive than I normally would spend on a dinner for 2, but totally worth it. Needs a good bread to compliment the pasta. Recipe exceeded our expectations, and can't wait to make again!

I LOVE LOVE this pasta!  It tastes like something you would get at a fine restaurant in my opinion.  I had my own fresh basil and mint which was nice.  If you feel like you need to have meat, grill chicken would be good with it as well.  Overall it's a somewhat light, very fresh, summer dish!

My new favorite pasta recipe. Very refreshing, rather than rich. Used red wine vinegar and omitted the mint. Added the cheese to the dish after it was on the plates. Thanks for a lovely recipe.

SO good! instead of the sherry i used a balsamic vinegrette, instead of mint a bit of cilantro, cheddar and parmesan cheese, and chicken/fontina/basil sausage. and it's true, keep the pasta over a low heat when stirring in the cheeses and it will all melt together. Delicious!

This was just okay for me.  Adding the cheese to the hot pasta just made it clump up on the fork not melt nice throughout it.  It would be better to just add it to the top.  I must admit I did not use the cream sherry but used balsamic vinegar so I can't really comment on the exact recipe I just know the procedure for adding the cheese and room temperature tomato mixture wasn't great.

I thought this was very tasty even without the fresh mint and sherry cream (didn't have any ). Followed other ingredients the same. I reserved a bit of the pasta water and added to the cooked pasta and tomato mix. The cheese did tend to clump a bit while melting. I mixed with a fork until mostly melted and tomatos added. The pasta water helped that. I used angel hair pasta. This will definitely be on my meatless Monday menu again!

The reviews sounded great, but I followed recipe to the tee with the exception of sherry and adding balsamic, however it did not turn out well for me. Tasted like basil with olive oil.

I make this for a group of friends and instead of Asiago and Fontina cheese, I use a combination of Brie and Mozzarella, and sprinkle gnerously with pecorino romano before serving...delicious and always a favorite.

Awesome recipe.  I added fresh salad shrimp and a few chopped kalamata olives and I didnt add the mint.  Turned out fantastic and everyone who tried it gave it rave reviews.  Served with crusty rolls, green salad and red wine.  Easy and delicious - what more could you ask for!

I was looking for a recipe that used lot's of tomatoes and basil and I struck GOLD!  You have to try this one.  I didn't have sherry or mint or the special cheese.  So as suggested I used a 1/4 cup of balsamic and I mixed in one cup of jack and a half cup of parm with two forks.  It melted prefectly.  Oh, and I added two tablespoons of toasted pine nuts.  Mahalo for this tastey recipe!

Wow! This simple recipe is awesome! I wondered about adding the cheese to the pasta, but it made it even more delicious. Once the pasta was drained I put it back in the pan, added 1/2 cup of the juice from the tomato mixture, tossed it, then added the cheese. I did use two forks as someone had suggested while mixing and had no problems getting it to melt all around. Oh, and the cheese I had used was Costco's Havarati sliced cheese and didn't add the mint, nor the sherry.

This was delicious.  We had no leftovers.  I didn't add the mint though.  The only problem was that the kids didn't like it.

I loved this. Made it for my husband and he loved it also. I did change it, I took out the mint and I replaced the sherry with the balsamic. Had no problems with the cheese melting, and the cheese where excellent for that dish.

I used balsalmic vinegar since I didn't have any sherry.  The dish was pretty good.  I have made it a few times since.

I thought it was going to be incredible but it wasn't. The taste of the marinade was very tasty aside from having so much garlic it overpowers everything else. And I love garlic. I love fontina, but it was gross in this dish. The marinade changed to a strange garlicky liquid after it was added to hot pasta. It is beyond me why anyone would rate this 5 stars. It would be better if the herbs, garlic, and oil were pureed and the tomatoes were peeled, but that doesn't solve the problems that the sauce is too thin to coat the pasta and the globs of cheese sticking to everything,including a horrendous cleanup experience afterward. It stuck to the dishes like wax.

I just finished making this and had to stop and write a review, amazing!! Like some of the others I used balsamic vinegar instead of sherry and I didn't use cheese since I didn't have any and come to find out that it didn't need any cheese at all! All of you that are having a hard time with the cheese melting, just try it with none or maybe Romano or Parmesan would be good perhaps. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've been making this for years and it's divine!  I like it with fresh mozzarella and my husband likes as is with grilled chicken thrown in.  Thank you, Gayle!  Any leftovers are gone at lunch the next day.

Really good. Next time I would half the recipe since there is only two of us. I didnt think it was a good leftover dish. However I might consider only mixing half the full mixture the first night.

I would love to like this, but I can't.  The cheese melted fine at first but as soon as I added the tomatoes, it all clumped back together.  So I put it back on the stove to heat it up so the cheese would melt again.  It was edible, but I didn't enjoy eating it.  In fact, the leftovers are being thrown away.  The cheese was still clumpy and it was pretty bland.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It seems like a waste of good tomatoes, basil and cheese.

Delicious!  I made a couple of small changes, not for any reason other than that I didn't have the required ingredients.  I didn't have mint or cream sherry or fontina cheese. I omitted the mint and added extra fresh basil, made my own cream sherry by adding a teaspoon dark brown sugar to cooking sherry, and used mozzarella in place of fontina.  My husband, who really loves his meat, could not get enough of this dish.  I will make this again!

This was fantastic! I used a couple dashes of balsamic vinegar instead of the sherry and I didn't have fontina cheese so skipped that. I grilled chicken (using Montreal Steak seasoning) and served the chicken with this. Delicious summer meal!

Made this for guests on a Friday after work.  Wanted something showcasing garden goodies, delicious and quick!  This was fantastic!  I followed advice of others and used balsamic, adding shrimp sautéed in butter and olive oil-- tossed shrimp and buttery oil in with tomato marinade over pasta.  Rave reviews!

My boyfriend usually won't eat raw tomatoes, but, we really enjoyed this side.  I did cut the oil and cheese way back to make it healthier.
