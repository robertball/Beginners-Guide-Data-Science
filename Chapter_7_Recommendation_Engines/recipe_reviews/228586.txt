sorry i mixed up between my mom's recipe and grandma's recipe . it should have been ( 1/3 cup rose water - 1 2/3 cup of water ) instead of 1/2 rose and 1 1/2 water ...

you can also replace rose water with orange blossom water .. but as for me , i prefer the rose one..

last time i did it was with slices of strawberries (after adding couple of table spoons of sugar and let it rest for 15 min ) 
it was amazing ^_^

The amount of rose water seems excessive. I decreased the amount to 2 tbsp of rose water and traded out the dry milk powder for 2.5 cups of milk and I liked it better.

easy recipe, but however, I couldn't get past the smell of rose petals in my digestion. Something about eating what I normally smell on potpourri and perfumes, wasn't something I could handle after I made it. I really am trying to be subjective here. While I love the fragrance of roses...this totally took me to a new level when trying to down it in this recipe. Had I been accustom to eating this growing up, I would probably have enjoy it. But putting it in my mouth and swallowing it, was very off-putting when I did. I couldn't get past the one spoonful. But you don't know these things until you try them. And now I'm experienced to know, I won't be making again. My apologies. This recipe will probably suit others that are accustom to eating and drinking rose water, just won't be making it again in my household.
