As written, this recipe is worthy of two stars, as there is not much flavor going on here. The recipe noticeably is absent of any seasonings, including salt and pepper. With my modifications, however,  I'd call this 4 stars--much better. I dredged the chicken in flour seasoned with Montreal Chicken Seasoning before browning, but added no flour to the sauce as I knew it wouldn't be necessary.  After removing the chicken from the pan, I sauteed shallots and minced garlic before adding the broth, half and half, some white wine, and the Dijon. As the sauce reduced I added some chopped, fresh tarragon for added dimension and flavor which really worked nicely. I admit the end result was probably a different dish, albeit a better one.

I'm sure this is a great recipe alone, but I used it as a base to recreate one of my favorite restaurants dishes.  I seasoned the chicken with lemon-pepper seasoning & then followed the rest of the sauce prep.  I then placed the chicken on a bed of cooked spinach, topped with the sauce & provolone cheese.  Then I baked it for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  To die for!

As I stands, I think it's an "okay" recipe.  As a chef, if you really want to make this a stand out dish, then leave out the flour, use heavy cream (although if you're cutting fat, you can get away with fat free half and half, but it's not as impressive), add stone ground mustard (gives it some oopmh in texture and flavor) and tarragon to taste.  Serve it with some type of potato (Duchesse or croquettes are perfect) and a delicate green veg like asparagus.  Preparing the dish this way is not only easier, but these small changes make it a truly French dish that's wonderful in both taste and appearance.  You can also switch it around a bit and use beef tenderloin!

Although there was no reason for the chicken to be placed on a warmed plate, or in the oven afterward, this recipe was wonderful! Once the chicken was sauteed, I merely set it aside and made the sauce. Once the sauce was done, I put the chicken back into the sauce pan and let it simmer. I did, of course add, onion and garlic powders along with black pepper and fresh rosemary. Great Janet and thanks so much for a fantastic recipe that my family loved!

I rate the recipe as is, 4 stars.  However utilizing others comments I made it into a 5 star recipe.  Here's what I did to make it extra good...  1.I pounded the chicken to 1/2" thick and seasoned it generously with lemon-pepper  2.I doubled the sauce, I had a little extra, but wouldn't have had enough if I hadn't doubled  3.I added 2 tsp of minced garlic and 2 tsp of minced shallots to the pan once chicken was done cooking, and sauteed til tender  4.I cut the chicken broth down to 3/4 c and added 1/4 of an oaky chardonay  5.I used honey dijon mustard  6.I added provalone to the chicken before putting the sauce over it.  I cooked as directed, though my oven would not go that low.  It's great to prepare this meal in advance and then pop it in the oven at a higher temp for the recommended time when your ready to eat.  My boyfriend loved it, and it was something new to both of us that we both enjoyed.

I marinated the chicken in mustard and balsamic vinegar overnight.  A very good meal.

That was absolutely fantastic! :)  I've just finished eating, and ran to the computer immediately. ;)
The only things I changed were: I sliced the chicken to increase the cooking time, and didn't put it in the oven - instead I added the chicken pieces back to the sauce once it was ready and reheated.  I also used taragon mustard as I didn't have dijon handy.
Absolutely excellent recipe. :)

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Tasted like something you'd get at a fancy restaurant, and the preparation was easy.  Very good served over rice with peas and mushrooms, or try with mashed potatoes.

This dish was wonderful and easy.  Cooking the chicken breasts is the longest part of the process, but you want it cooked thoroughly!  The butter, as opposed to margarine, makes for a much richer sauce, as does using heavy cream.  I served it with broccoli and wild rice - yum!

I added a little salt and pepper to the chicken while sauteing and added an extra 1/2 T of dijon mustard to the sauce.  I also didn't see the point of heating the chicken in the oven after adding the sauce so I just served it.  It was pretty good.

With a few modifications you can lighten this up and make it tastier too.  First of all, lose the butter and replace with canola oil, then replace the half-and-half with the fat-free version.  Now, brown a chopped onion with the chicken, and use some salt (I use lite salt) on the chicken too.  Finally, salt the sauce in step 3 to taste, and add some garlic powder too (try 1/2 tsp to start).  Suddenly a bland and fattening dish becomes healthy, and the flavor really pops out.  Enjoy!

I've made Chicken Dijon for my family for years and this recipe lacks a few key ingredients.  Season the chicken first with some lemon pepper and garlic or onion powder.  I also pound/tenderize the breasts before seasoning as well so they cook evenly.  I don't use butter any longer, using a cooking spray and non-stick pan works just fine without the additional calories.  For fool proof gravy, whisk the 1/2 and 1/2 with flour in separate bowl before adding to pan (I even just use lowfat milk sometimes).   Add chicken back to the gravy mixture & serve over rice.  My husband and kids request this meal every couple of weeks!

My family really liked this recipe. I doubled the sauce and served it over egg noodles. It made just the right amount. I ran out of half and half and had to use a little milk and it still turned out good. I did not put it in the oven, I just combined everything in the skillet at the end and let it simmer

I thought this was a great recipe. I took suggestions from others but also tried replacing the half and half to make it healthier. I ended up seasoning the chicken with a little parmesan and italian bread crumbs before cooking. To make the dijon sauce, I replaced the half and half  with FAGE greek yougurt. I also added a little bit of white wine. Finally as suggested by others I melted a small amount a provolone melted on top. Thanks for sharing this great recipe... a keeper for sure!

I have been preparing an alternative to this receipe for a while. This receipe seems to cook the chicken far too long but I digress. My steps are to flour the chicken,sautee for about 4 minutes per side, remove the chicken to a warming station. Deglaze the skillet with white wine stirring up all of the bits left in the pan.  Reduce the wine by half and then stir in a big dollop of Dijon and reduce until you have a sauce that will coat a wooden spoon.  I don't add cream to my preparation but you could add cream in the last few minutes. AND THEN zest of 1/2 lemon to brighten the dish. Viola!

The sauce is yummy.  I took the advice of precious reviewers and coated my chicken first in bread crumbs and then browned in olive oil, not butter.  The I baked the chicken first for 18min at 350.  I topped with the sauce and baked for anoter 5min.  Good with a side of roasted garlic mashed potatoes :)

My family loved it but I added course salt and pepper as I browned each side of the chicken. I will make this again the same way except I will add a little white wine when deglazing the pan for depth.

I made several adjustments following other member's advice. I pounded my chicken to 1/2" thick and seasoned with poultry seasoning. I added some kosher salt, fresh cracked black pepper, and seasoning salt. I did not put in the oven. Was very good and we liked the flavor.

As is the recipe is a bit bland, I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper and thyme before cooking, I added an additional tablespoon of the mustard and used heavy cream. The result was a nice dish everyone liked and the sauce was not overwhelming at all, really a nice compliment to the chicken. I will make this again with these changes.

We made this recipe for dinner last night and it was very good.  I will definitely make it again!  I salted and peppered the chicken before sauteeing it in the butter, just because I always do that.  The sauce was really thick, so next time I think I'll add a splash more chicken broth.  I served it with buttered egg noodles and green beans.  I wish I had doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers today!

my gut told me to dredge the chicken first in flour or bread crumbs before browning, but i decided to stay true (or very close) to the recipe.  BIG mistake.  the chicken was so, SO bland and tasted like an afterthought.  the sauce was really good, and i added a little more broth and half and half once i saw how little it made.  the sauce is what saved my rating this a 1 star recipe.

We found this recipe bland (we love mustard), if we were to try it again we would add garlic, more mustard, and salt.  Some cheese (as other reviewers suggested) would probably be great too!

EXCELLENT dish.  Remarkably easy and quick to prepare.  I made it for the first time last weekend for some friends of ours.  I was skeptical, but one of them asked me to prepare it again at our next dinner.  I did, however, add 2 small cloves of garlic.  Femeril loves garlic.

My family loved this--every one of us!  Definitely add salt and pepper, though, and I did add a bit more Dijon for more "punch".  I will absolutely make this again!

I had some reservations about this recipe when I first began making it.  I tasted the sauce before I poured it over the chicken and it seemed to be bland.  But after I poured it on the chicken and baked it, all the chicken juices really flavored it up.  I did have to bake it at 200, since that is as low as my oven goes.  I kept it in there more like 30 minutes, while I prepared the rest of dinner.  Served it over amish egg noodles and it was delicious.  A nice, delicate sauce with just the right amount of flavor.

I made it as written and totally agree with other reviewers that it needs some serious seasoning, at the LEAST salt and pepper!  My 2 year old loved it though!  "Naples" comments may have been a better alternative but maybe could have been presented in a less superior way?

This recipe was a good base.  It just seems to be lacking something.  I did add the provolone prior to adding the sauce.  I sauteed the chicken with a garlic pepper seasoning and then added minced garlic before the flour.  Everyone liked the finished product.  I do believe I will use stone ground mustard next time.

My mother makes a similar dish that is my favorite way to eat chicken... dredge the chicken in flour and seasoning of your choice, brown in butter and oil. Take chicken out, to the pan add dijon and vermouth (around half a jar and 1/4 of a bottle, can be played around with to your tastes, I like a lot of mustard) add a dollop of sour cream. Mix, simmer and add chicken. My mom covers at this point and cooks until the sauce is thick, you could also serve now. We like this with cheese potatoes or rice.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I cut my chicken into chunks and sauteed it with some mccormick chicken seasoning added to it.  Once it was done, I removed it from the pan and left it on a covered, heated plate while I made the sauce.  I doubled the sauce ingredients to serve this over pasta.  I added the chicken back in at the end just to make sure it was still warm enough, but I skipped the baking part.  I also added broccoli flowerets into this by tossing them into the pasta water for the last few minutes of cooking time.  That added some nice color and additional flavor to the dish.  My husband, six year old and four year old all cleaned their plates and they all had seconds too, so I will definitely make this again!

I cut the chicken into chunks instead of whole breasts, and didn't put it in the oven afterwards, but this was a great recipe. It really impressed my boyfriend who's a very finicky eater. I will definitely use this again.

This was so good.  The other raters said that the sauce may be too thick, so I added more chicken broth.  I also didn't put as much dijon, because I didn't want the flavor to be 
too strong.  I made fresh mushrooms with garlic in butter and added this to the sauce.  I served this with thin spaghetti. Ummm yum yum.

This dish was very good. I used a just little less dijon mustard than was called for and I added some tarragon to the sauce. We ate it over whole wheat pasta and it was wonderful. I might throw a little white wine and some mushrooms into the sauce next time I make it. Definately a keeper!!!

Very tasty, but my sauce separated when I added the mustard, and turned out a bit goopy. I didn't really understand the purpose of letting the chicken sit on a warm platter for 10 minutes while making the sauce, then in a warm oven for another 10-15 minutes after pouring the sauce on it. I preheated the oven (with the platter) while cooking the chicken. When the chicken was cooked, I put it on the platter and left it in the oven while preparing the sauce. After I topped it with the sauce, I just left it in the oven long enough to make a salad, and I thought it was fine. I'll certainly try the recipe again.

Love this dish!!!!  My 10 year old finicky eaters love it too!  The sauce is what makes the dish stand out.  I've used both the stone ground mustard and smooth dijon (I do NOT tell my kids there is Dijon mustard in it, they wouldn't eat it!).  Both mustards create equally as tasty results.  Really!!  The stone ground makes it a tad more flavorful.  Always double the sauce, since there isn't quite enough to put over potatoes, rice or noodles.  This is one of my favorite recipes and I'm so thankful to have found it.  I'm an above average cook and know basic sauce techniques.  I haven't tried other suggestions to use olive oil I stead of butter; I'm afraid to change the recipe as it's great as is.  I like other reviewers input on adding seasoning to the chicken prior to frying.  NOTE: tastes way better if you use the jarred condensed chicken broth (you add tablespoon to a cup of water.  It is not bouillon!  It's called "Better Than Bouillion", I think.  You refrigerate the paste after opening. This dish gets a richer flavor from this broth, as opposed to canned or cubes versions.  I also cook at 350 for at least 15 minutes after browning chicken.  Modern ovens don't allow such low heat as recipe calls for.  Plus, I want to ensure chicken is cooked through.  Great with fingerling potatoes, green beans and a salad!  Tastes even better the next day, reheated!!  Thanks again for a staple recipe we will continue to make!  I'll try the white wine reduction to reduce amt of cream.

My family and I enjoyed this one...very easy too! I did change it up a little. I added about a tablespoon of honey and some rosemary which added a different dimension to the flavor. My hubby and daugther liked the honey-mustard flavor! I also added heavy cream instead of half and half...only because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up.

I used this recipe for the sauce which was excellent.  I prepared my chicken differently.  I pounded my breasts, dipped them in seasoned flour, dipped in egg and then coated them in a panko/parmesen mix before I browned them.  Turned out to be exactly what we wanted.  Thanks!

This was a great recipe!  Quick and easy, too.  I rarely use half and half in recipes, so I subsituted with milk and cut the amount in half, to 1/4 cup.  It was just enough to give it a creamy texture and still thicken into a sauce.  I also used a garlic pepper seasoning on the chicken, prior to making the sauce.  My family enjoyed it, even the picky ones!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe as it stands is bland, bland and bland...I used a creamy dijon "maille" brand from France thinking that any more "rustic" mustard would be too much for this dish.  Use the spiciest, hottest dijon that you can find.  It is a nice cream sauce just waiting for some more flavouring.  Take the advice of other reviewers and add a rub while frying up the chicken or add something more to the sauce.

I've been making this dish for 20 years. For anyone who finds this recipe a little bland, it will make a big difference in flavor if you add 1/2 tsp Lemon Pepper and 1/2 tsp. Onion Salt.

I thought it was Yummy.  My finicky kid thought it was OK and hard to please husband thought it was good.  I added a piece of Provolone cheese on top of each chicken breast and put it under the broiler till melted before I put the sauce on.

LOVE IT! I added dried dill and cilantro to it, and it was fantastic. I also just used milk instead of cream to lower the fat content. I skipped all those pots and steps, I just mixed the sauce, threw in the chicken, and put it all in the oven. I baked it for about 45 min...perfect!!!

Excellent and easy. Great with beet salad with goat cheese. I just cooked 2 breasts and same amt. sauce, baked at 170. Very moist.

I make this recipe often but have a couple of changes.  Before sauteeing the breasts I flatten them with a meat mallet to ensure they cook throughout and then salt and pepper them before dipping in flour. I use 1 1/2 T. butter and 1 1/2 T. canola oil for sauteeing the breasts.  For the sauce, I add 1/2 c. cooking sherry.  This is a family favorite.  My kids love this.

I'd say an average flavor. I thought there'd be more of a kick. I ended up doubling the mustard, adding a touch of red pepper flakes, and letting it marinate overnight.

This was okay.  It made a lot of sauce which I liked, but I found the sauce to be bland. I think it's a great starter recipe and that you should not be afraid to add your own seasonings to it to make it your own.  I served it with rice and broccoli.

I don't think I ever make a recipe without altering it in some way (except when I'm baking).  This recipe was delicious.  The sauce was creamy and smooth, what I would consider comfort food.  Was it the most flavoful dish, maybe not, but we all know how to add spices.  Spruce it up however you would like and enjoy.

The chicken was good, and the sauce was pretty good, but together, the two didn't seem to give off much flavor. If I did it again, I would add more dijon.

This sauce was so quick and easy and yummy.  I used normal cream and perhaps next time might try a smidge of garlic powder, and definitely will do some pasta to mop up some of the sauce.

The sauce had a very nice taste.  I would thin the sauce a bit with more chicken broth, or with more half and half -- chicken broth is healthier.  Thanks Janet for a good and easy meal.

Yummy sauce, Janet. Due to our love of Dijon, I added an extra tablespoon and a small amount of garlic powder. I preferred to use a second pan for the sauce and left the breasts on warm stove with cover. I poured sauce over breasts, then topped with 3T finely grated parmesan cheese and stuck it under the broiler just long enough to melt the cheese. Yummy!

This was okay--I took the others' advice and didn't set the chicken aside and THEN put it in the oven.  I took the chicken out of the pan when it was almost done and tented it with tin foil and popped it in the oven (since the chicken still cooks after removed from the pan).  I found the sauce really goopy and thick.  It wasn't very flavourful and I was a little disappointed.  I probably won't make it again.

Sauce tasted wonderful, but I didn't like the temperature. After sitting to the side for 10 minutes, then sitting for 15 minutes at 150, the chicken just seemed to be cold when it was served.

HAD THIS DISH TONIGHT.  IT WAS VERY TASTY. SERVED IT WITH RICE AND IT MADE A NICE SAUCE FOR THE RICE. I DID NOT SEASON THE CHICKEN WHEN SAUTEING IT AND THINK I WILL DO THAT THE NEXT TIME.  A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER WOULD ADD A LITTLE MORE FLAVOR TO THE CHICKEN. ALL IN ALL IT WAS AN EASY AND TASTY DISH AND I WILL CERTAINLY HAVE IT AGAIN. THANKS FOR THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE ANOTHER WAY TO SERVE CHICKEN.

Delicious.  If the chicken pieces are not the same thickness, it may be good to flatten or otherwise trim so that they cook evenly.  I added a tiny sprinkle of poultry seasoning to the chicken, but it really wasn't needed.  The butter, mustard, and cream added plenty of flavor on their own.

I just finished eating this chicken with my hubby.  MY GOD!!!!!  It was amazing.  The only thing I did different was bake it in the oven longer than it said to and at a higher heat, 325 deg. F for about an extra 30 minutes.  I must say that both my hubby and I admit..it is one of the BEST chicken dishes we have ever had.  So moist and delicious.  Thankyou for this recipe.

This was pretty good. It's a very delicate flavor, therefore the sauce does need a bit of a kick, next time maybe some lemon juice or I may just use spicy mustard. I did use the stone ground. I also went the way of some reviewers and put provolone on the chicken before the sauce, and it almost seemed TOO creamy! As I said the sauce was pretty good, but it needs something.

A quick but very good chicken dish for dinner.  I'll add one suggestion which I used tonight.  After cooking the chicken I added another 3 TBS of butter and then doubled all the rest of the sauce ingredients.  I cooked a pound of mini penne while I was stirring the sauce.  I ladled about 2/3 of the sauce over the chicken before putting it in the oven as instructed and then put the remaining third over the penne.  The sauce I mixed with the penne was just enough to coat the pasta not to make it soupy.  After dinner I mixed the extra sauce and leftover chicken from the platter in with the leftover pasta and it was GREAT as leftovers the day!

Very nice recipe that was easy to prepare and cook. Next time I'll add a little more dijon to perk it up just a bit more for my taste.

I used a whole grain dijon mustard and added a few cloves of garlic while cooking the chicken.  In addition I preseasoned the chicken with Adobe seasoning.  Put on a bed of Basmati rice and surrounded with blanched spinach.  The end result was absolutly scrumptious!!

Just about everything we cook needs a little seasoning- I don't want to put any words into the contributor's mouth, but I'd be a bit surprised if Janet didn't do something to it- even just a little salt and pepper would be almost automatic when doing the browning. I did, plus a little garlic, as others have done as well, plus a dash of Mrs. Dash's lemon poultry seasoning. But what really made it quite delicious for myself and Dad was adding tarragon to the sauce while simmering. Tarragon, dijon and chicken? A marriage made in heaven (well, you get the drift...).

I followed the recipe exactly (something I rarely do) and it was very good. My guest enjoyed it enough to ask for the recipe. I may make it again but I would season the chicken and try adding sautéed mushrooms to the sauce before serving. Thanks for the recipe.

Greetings from Shizuoka, Japan! Being born in Dijon, it was a great pleasure to read your recipe! Back home we just take the whole chicken, season it with salt and pepper inside and outside. Then we cover it competely in Dijon mustard and bake it whole in the oven with a lttle oil and butter we baste it from time to time! Now have you tried drinking Cote Chalonnaise white like Rully, Bouzeron, Montagny or Givry with it? Once again congratulations! Robert-Gilles

This is a winner! The taste is wonderful, and it's easy to make! I served it with pasta, but rice would be good too. Definitely want something to soak up the terrific sauce. My family raved about it. I was out of chicken broth, so I used a teaspoon of powdered chicken boullion to one cup of water.

This chicken was excellent and quick to make. I seasoned the breasts with lemon pepper before pan frying. When the gravy/sauce was ready, I spooned a little over each breast then topped them with a slice of mild white Cheddar cheese. I broiled them until the cheese melted and was bubbling. I served this with rice and used the extra sauce to spoon over the rice.

I dredged my chicken in egg and flour and fried it up in a pan. I made the sauce in the pan using the browned bits as a start for the dijon sauce. It is a tasty dish.

I made this for my husband and his friend and they ate all of it before I had a chance to taste more than one bite!  It is definately one I would try again.  I added a little more mustard.

This was good!  I only made 5 chicken tenders but made the whole amount of sauce.  It made a lot of sauce, and it was thick!  It got a little too thick actually; I thinned it with a little skim milk and it was still super thick.  It makes me think the cream isn't needed- you could probably get the same results with milk.  The broth/flour mixture got really thick in the first place.  I used half regular dijon and half whole-grain dijon.  The mustard seeds gave a nice look to the sauce.  A little extra mustard would be good in this.  I didn't bother doing the oven thing (what's that about?).  Instead I put the cooked chicken on a dish tightly covered with foil until I ate and it worked fine.  Served with whole wheat fettucini and Pan-Fried Asparagus from this site.

This is really a quick yet fascinating recipe. I brown the chicken with a little bit of rosemary, so it gives a different flavour in the chicken.
I also added a little bit of hot spice (I like spicy/hot food).
Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!!  I'm glad I saw the comments about doubling the sauce... I wish there had been even more left over.  I agree that it's not a very colorful dish, but hey... close your eyes and dig in!!  (or add pimentos or red pepper pieces)

The sauce is absolutely delicious! i did not put the chicken on an oven safe plate, but per other users suggestion set it aside and then mixed in after the sauce was ready. i also cut the chicken into cubes and sprinkled garlic/onion powder/pepper on it while cooking. very yummy! hubby will have a delicious lunch tomorrow with the leftovers.

Very good! I seasoned the chicken with some salt, pepper and garlic powder while browning it. Other than that I followed the recipe to the "T". The sauce came out tasty and very rich and was great over some egg noodles! I might try adding just a little more dijon next time. SO EASY TOO!! :)

I didn't like this recipe at all.  The sauce was SUPER strong and not very good.  That's my opinion though.  My husband said it was "very good, but not his favorite."

Very good dish. However — I found it a little flavorless as it’s written. I added white wine to give it a little more flavor and it complimented the mustard well. I also added some garlic for extra flavor and I used low-fat plain Greek yogurt in place of the heavy cream. It turned out very good but I think it was a bit better with a few adjustments.

This app is driving me crazy!     .... as I was about to say... this recipe turned out DEELISH!  However I made some - very minor - adjustments.   I added about 1-2 tsp tarragon and a few sprinkles of dill weed.   In addition to chicken stock, added about 1/2-1 c of white wine to the cook down, prior to adding the cream.   I served it with saffron rice and stir fried green beans.

We love it with asparagus. Sometimes I add mushrooms. I never use step 4 in the oven. 
 I printed this recipe in 2007 in order to put in my folder. 
I am know adding it to my computer menu folder.

This is in our regular rotation. I don't bake it, though. I brown the chicken in a skillet (sliced very thin). Remove from pan, make the dijon sauce and add the chicken back. I let it simmer for 20-30 minutes. Sometimes I add a little more chicken broth if it gets thick too quickly. It is soooo tender.

I made a few modifications to the original recipe. First, I doubled the sauce and allowed the chicken to simmer in it for a bit. Second, I used double the Dijon, and lastly I added artichoke hearts.

This was very good! I chopped up the chicken breast, used half/half fat free, so I added a little bit more flour and some cornstarch to thicken it up. I also added some portabella mushrooms ( I LOVE mushrooms!!) and garlic to taste. I backed it at 200, for about 20 min, and then added panko crumbs and parmesan cheese on top, then then broiled it on high for about 5-10 min-watching it. Turned out great, thanks!!

This recipe was extremely easy to make and tasted wonderful!  My wife really likes Dijon Chicken and pronounced this the best I have ever made.  The only change I made was to use a little heavy cream with the half and half.

The only ingredients I added to this were, per another suggestion, a little spice (salt, pepper, garlic powder), and some chopped fresh tarragon (about 1 Tbsp). I don't know what I'm going to do with the other 95% of the tarragon I bought. But it was worth it.

This is a weekly meal for us. The only alterations I make is I slice the breast thinly and brown them in a cast iron skillet. Remove, deglaze and return the chicken to the thickened sauce. Simmer for a while, 20 minutes or so. Add the half and half and turn off the skillet for around 10 minutes...PERFECT!

I used a few tips from the reviews including seasoning the chicken before pan frying, substituting white wine for some chicken stock, and adding tarragon. This made a great Sunday dinner paired with oven roasted potatoes and steamed green beans.

This turned out great.  I did change some things.   I floured the chicken before putting in the pan. I put salt and pepper in the flour. When that was done I  sautéed mushrooms and shallots and added 2 cloves of garlic at the end of this step so it wouldn't burn. I then removed that from pan and used flour and butter to make a quick roo (I don't know how to spell it so I wrote phonetically). Added chicken stock to deglaze.  Added the cream, and reduced. Add capers and mustard and simmer.  Add back in chicken and mushrooms and served over noodles.

Made this in morning, cooked the chicken in pan then transferred to crockpot for meal later in the day. The crockpot kept the chicken warm and finished the cooking process. I cut the breasts into small bite size chunks for ease in serving. To the pan with raw chicken, I added lemon pepper, red chili flakes, poultry seasoning and salt and cooked chicken till no longer pink. I then removed the chicken from pan and placed the chicken in a crockpot on warm. I added a quarter cup of white wine to the pan with chicken dripping and simmered till the wine reduced to half. I then added several mushroom to pan and a few cloves of garlic, along with a T. of dried tarragon and let cook through. At this point, I then followed the recipe starting with step 3.  I served with white rice cooked in chicken broth. (I did make extra sauce because I like to drown my rice in the sauce)

Eeek couldn't eat it I ended up brushing it off. I guess I just don't like that flavor/texture combo. I followed others suggestions and it was super bland even with that, added salt afterwards and still bland. Just felt like I was eating unnecessary extra fat for the sake of eating fat.

Good recipe, but you do have to add some spices. I added a bit of garlic powder and onion powder. It is a good recipe though.

Based on Kat's review this recipe was 5 stars!  I changed this quite a bit using 3/4 cup of broth and 1 1/2 cups cream no flour, I also seasoned the chicken before pan frying, I sprinkled with salt pepper and garlic.  I also added about a teaspoon of tarragon. My oven will only go to 170, so that's what I used to keep everything warm while the potato croquettes and brocoli cooked.  Everything was fantastic 

Huge hit!! My husband had seconds and took leftovers in his lunch. My 1 year old ate every bite.  We used some of the sauce to 'flavor' her broccoli and she ate every bite.  She's always a pretty good eater, but last night she ate EVERY single bite, without feeding the dog any!

Yum!  Hubby agreed that this was pretty tasty!  I only made slight changes - salt, pepper, and taragon on the chicken after pounding (these breasts were gigantic) and before cooking.  I doubled the sauce per another's suggestion but that was too much sauce.  Next time I'll make 1.5 times the sauce but still 2x the dijon as we both thought the dijon flavor could have been more intense.  I also used fat-free half and half.  Still yummy.  Will be adding to the rotation.

I have only made Chicken Dijon using heavy cream and the mustard. I will try this but cutting back on the chicken broth and using extra cream. The chicken broth I'm sure will give a subtle flavor.

I agree with the majority of reviewers that this recipe needs a little "something" to build on the basic recipe.  I added salt, pepper, and then a little sherry to the sauce.  Hubby loved it!  Can't wait to make it again.  Next time I think I'll add some sweet vidalia onion.

I was concerned the sauce would be overpowering, but it was very good, with just a hint of dijon.  I only used 3 chicken breasts so there was a lot of sauce left for the rice.

This recipe was very good!  I did dredge the chicken in some Grandma's Garden poultry seasoning and flour, and I added some green onions and tarragon to the sauce.  I also didn't let the chicken and sauce sit in the oven since I was using it for something else, but the sauce is amazing.

I thought this was a great foundation recipe. There are so many ways to alter it to keep it fresh tasting even if you make it a few times a month. Tonight I made it for the first time and my husband and I both loved it. The only things I changed was a slight decrease in mustard (I used only about 2/3 of what I'd measured out) and I added a tablespoon or two of brown sugar.  The consistency was fantastic; very thick and rich even though it was half and half instead of cream. I'll definitely be doing this one again.

The sauce on this is super delicious.  I felt like a French chef!  A little lemon pepper and dried basal brightened it up in a lovely way for even more flavor.

Solid family fare.  Very tasty.  I flattened the chicken breasts slightly since they seem to cook more evenly that way, and sprinkled them quite liberally with Lawry's Chicken Seasoning and Rub before browning.  This recipe is a keeper.

I also add fresh sliced mushrooms and salt and fresh ground pepper.  For those not wanting to mess with the sauce, jarred chicken gravy saves that step.  My sons love it served over wild rice.

This is a keeper mainly for the sauce.. I spiced the ckn up but it needed more texture... maybe panko breading next time. My husband raved about the sauce and was eating it by spoonfuls! I added a bit of garlic and jane's mixed up salt to it... mmmm

Oops. I forgot that my husband hates condiments. He smelled the mustard and refused to eat it. However, I enjoyed it. It was a little bland, so next time I'll add the onion and some rosemary like another person suggested. Really easy and quick.

The whole family really loved this recipe. I did follow some others advice and added spices while cooking, such as pepper, salt, garlic and onion powder. I cooked the chicken in a skillet then moved it to a plate while I made the sauce then added the chicken back into the skillet and put it on low with the lid, instead of in the oven and it came out really well. I, too, also doubled the sauce which I highly recommend doing. We had it over wide egg noodles.

This recipe was good, but I did follow the others advice to add salt and pepper while cooking the chicken. I didn't have chicken stock, but I did have beef stock and it still turned out fine.
