This recipe works great for hot evenings and a quick dinner.  I add chunks of cucumber for a fresh taste.  This recipe works really well as a appetizer by slicing wrap into small pieces and holding together with toothpicks.

Delicious! Perfect when you just don't feel like cooking dinner!  I used flour tortillas because that's what I had on hand.  I added a little sliced tomato and some shredded lettuce.

What a fabulous lunch I'm having today!  I made just one for myself, and it's delicious!  The sun-dried tomato pesto and cream cheese really make this wrap.  I used smoked deli turkey, swiss cheese, tomatoes, shredded romaine, and red onions.  I wish I had made two! Thanks for this recipe!

This was fast and easy.  I didn't cook the tortillas cause it makes them hard.  I like the soft ones-use the big burrito kind.  Bring salsa to dip and buy more than one avacado.

Since we smoked our turkey this year I thought these would be a good change from the usual sandwiches the day after.  Added the salsa right to the sour cream with a little extra garlic salt, also some shredded lettuce - Yum!

This was delicious! Excellent flavor. I used Mesquite smoked shaved lunchmeat turkey and American cheese slices. My only complaint is that it was "mushy" because all the textures were soft. It really needs some crisp lettuce or sprouts and maybe tomato or other veggies. For taste alone though I gave this a 5. I added some freshly ground black pepper.

I wasn't too impressed by this.  Not enough flavor by itself.  When you add other ingredients, it turns out pretty tasty.  I only gave it 3 stars since I had to add so much.

Looking for a simple but elegant lunch time meal?  I've served these wraps to family and friends - it's always a big hit.    Recently I've started adding pear slices.  Tastes great.  I usually serve this with a ceasar salad.  When I'm feeling lazy I've used store-bought guacamole (rather than peeling and slicing avacado)  but don't overdo it or it will ooze out the end of your wrap!

Enjoyed this for lunch today! Yum. For more flavor I put lime juice, cumin & chipotle powder in my sour cream sauce. So many possibilities with this one!

I made 40 of these (cut into halves, so there were 80 on the platter) for our "Last Days Of Summer" party.  Half done in deli ham, the other half in deli turkey.  With my 'fraidy cat group over here, I used typical sandwich toppings:  Meunster Cheese (Watch out, guys - It's not Kraft Singles!), Leaf Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion, and Light Mayo.  Didn't warm the tortillas - just left everything cold, and wouldn't you know?  There weren't many leftover.  I am DYING to try these as written, but it will be me only who eats them.

Followed the recipe except added fresh spinach suggested by another reviewer.  Would love it with or without.  EASY meal. Didn't want to cook.  Hit the spot!

This definitely gets plus points for speed and easiness and it's quite tasty too. I do think it was a bit bland, even after I put some salad dressing mix in the sour cream, and it needs more avocado. But an easy, light and interesting wrap to have for dinner when you're too tired to cook. Tumbs up.

We were skeptical on how the turkey would blend with the cheddar cheese. We were plesantly surprised.

This is a very simple recipe that you can easily customize to your taste!  I omitted the sour cream and substituted sliced provolone cheese for the cheddar.  I also added bacon and drizzled with ranch dressing before rolling up the wraps.  Next time, I think I'll add some roasted red peppers for a little kick, or maybe try the cream cheese with chives as others suggested.

I used Coby/montera cheese like from deli and then used carrots and rasins with a little mayo. I think next time i will also add lettuce. Everytime you find a sweet rasin It's like a great sweet little surprise. It's really good. I may even add mustard.

This is very good.  I added some precooked bacon strips and green pepper slices.  It's a great fast summer meal when I don't want to heat the kitchen up by cooking (I don't brown the tortillas first)

I enjoyed this, but my kids didn't like it at all.  I thought it was a wonderful mix of tastes, a great change from our usual lunch menu, and very filling.  I'll just fix the kids pb&j next time.  Leaves more for me! ha ha

I make these all the time but add a few strips of bacon, some shredded lettuce and tomato.  I prefer mayo instead of sour cream but either way they're great.

I actually made this for dinner with a Cesar Salad.   I was out of sour cream so I used ranch dressing.  Also added a slice of microwavable bacon.  Next time I'll add a little lettuce.  The recipe sounds so boring and basic but we both thought it was really tasty!  I'm on the hunt for some quick and easy dinners and this is a keeper!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars even though I didn't follow it exactly. It is a very good base recipe.

this is a very good base recipe I also used pepper turkey and instead of sour cream used the whipped cream cheese with chives as one person suggested this would be very good with bacon

These were a little bland for our taste, so I mixed cream cheese with pesto and horse radish, added cucumbers and fresh spinach.  Since I made them the day before an event, I omitted the avocado.  I also used the spinach wraps, which gave it a great flavor.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe. Now that I'm reading my review, I guess I made a whole new wrap.

I felt the measurements were a little off.  I used 30 thin strips of turkey, 1 cup of cheese, and added 4 diced roma tomatoes.  I still only got 8 wraps out of this.  Great base recipe though.
