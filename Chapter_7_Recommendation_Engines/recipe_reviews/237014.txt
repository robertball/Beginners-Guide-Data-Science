Had to make a few alterations due to health issues. Used gluten free broth. I have to be dairy free so I used coconut cream. Cilantro tastes like soap to my husband and me, so left that out. Used a bit of Stevia instead of sugar to keep simple carbs down. Tasted wonderful!

What a great recipe.  Like many of you I tweeked it a bit.  I caremalized the onions and added some garlic.  I subbed out the cilantro for basil and added 1/4 cup of parmasian cheese while the soup cooked.  After is was all prepared I sprinkled some more parmasian on top and served it with a grilled pimento cheese sandwich on rye bread.

This was really good.  I'm trying to get away from prepared canned soups with strange ingredients and are high in carbs and salt.  I made this for lunch today and we really liked it a lot.  I followed the directions pretty close except I cooked the onions more - till they started to caramelize.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable because that's what I had on hand.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe sweetiewoman!

Loved i! Very versatile would may be consider roasting some red bell peppers, adding a little more stock. The blender stick worked well for pureeing soup.

This soup is great! Super tasty, and has quite a kick. I didn't measure the red pepper flakes so that might be why it why so spicy!

I subbed parsley instead of cilantro and added a bit of fresh Parmesan cheese in the bottom of my bowl. I used fireroasted tomatoes with garlic so I didn’t add any extra garlic.

5.13.18   Love the versatility of making this soup either Italian or Mexican by using basil or cilantro, respectively.  Creamy, deep rich tomato flavor with just a hint of sweetness.  Wouldn’t change a thing in this recipe, it’s that good!   And did I say how easy this is???

I didn't add cilantro (none of my family likes it) but used basil as someone else suggested. It tasted very plain.

Fast and easy cream of tomato soup, perfect with grilled cheese sandwiches on a snowy day! I used 4 small onions, which I sauteed until they started to caramelize, then I added the garlic and other ingredients. I used basil for the cilantro as my son doesn't like it. I used Better than Bouillion vegetable base and evaporated milk for the cream. I definitely recommend doubling the recipe as it just made 4 bowls with no leftovers, served with Parmesan shreds on top.
