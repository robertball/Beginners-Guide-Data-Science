Omigosh.  This cake is superb!  I used fresh dates which were lovely and sticky when pureed, and the cake perfumed the house beautifully when baking.  We had this warm with cream;  a bit of caramel sauce (butter, brown sugar, cream) on the side would have gone well too.

We have been making a similar recipe for over 40 years.  However, our recipe is much more nutritionally friendly.

Very easy to make and turned out well too.  Looks a little more appealing with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

I never made Food for the Gods, never even heard of it - but all I can say is WOW - delicious!  Had my doubts when I was putting it together, but it is awesome - very simple too.  Will definitely make again!

This was absolutely delicious!! I made it for a church pot luck the morning of. No adjustments. My dates came prepackaged and pre-chopped, so I put them in the food processor; I couldn't quite pur√©e them, but I came as close as I could - smaller sticky chunks I had to break apart. I did the same with my walnut halves. The result was awesome!!
By the end of the pot luck, there was almost none left, so I'm making more right now - except that I'm out of dates, so I'm trying a mixture of raisins and dried cranberries.  We'll see!

Um, wow! it was pretty good, but my dates only were choppable, so it was like adding raisins to the batter. Still good, but not a very heaven-bound dessert - more of an end-of-beach-day treat.

Tried this with a few adjustments for a healthier option and it was a hit! Reduced sugar by 1cup (to 1/2 cup) and added 1/2 cup semolina for a crunch. I chopped the dates and soaked them in 1/2-3/4 cup boiling water with the bicarbonate soda and didn't puree them. If you prefer moist, you can bake it for 10 mins less.
