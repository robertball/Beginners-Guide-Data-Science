This recipe was great!  It is very versatile, I like that the measurements of the ingredients can be adjusted to your preference (adjust the curry and chili sauce for level of heat).  I didn't have the toasted sesame oil, or the rice wine vinegar on hand, and it was still very good!  I served it over noodles, topped with chicken, water chestnuts green onions, red bell peppers, chopped peanuts, bean sprouts and cilantro.  It got rave reviews at our dinner, and I've referred 2 people already to this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

This is a relatively easy recipe with authentic flavor.  I didn't have pickled ginger so I just used a bit of fresh.  Tastes like the restaurant down the street. Thanks!

The natural style peanut butter works well in this sauce, and like other reviewers, I added more coconut milk because the can is barely used when prepared as directed, it doesn't hurt it and it make more.  I used equal parts peanut butter coconut milk.  Also, I did not use the sweet chili sauce but the red chili paste because we use sweet chili sauce as the other condiment with the chicken skewers which we marinade with... did not use rice wine but substituted with red wine vinegar.  This is *excellent* in a meal with chicken bentos, rice and edamame, super easy too (though it does have some ingredients that you might have to shop for).  thanks to the submitter!

Made exactly according to the recipe except I didn't have any rice wine so I doubled the rice wine vinegar.  Served with spaghetti noodles and  chicken.  It tasted great, but the leftover sauce was a little thick and gloppy so I thinned the leftover with a couple Tbsp. of coconut milk.  This is almost identical to J. Alexanders' restaurant peanut sauce that they drizzle on their Thai Kai Chicken Salad that has already been tossed in honey-lime-cilantro viniagrette.  YUM!

Great recipe.  Better if made ahead to allow flavors to meld.  Added some red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Served with satay chicken skewers from Costco that are ready in 20 minutes.  Great condiment.

I didn't follow directions, my bad. I put everything in the sauce pan and looked back and it was thick, like sour cream.   SO...I added the whole can of cocount milk and added another t. of curry and 2 T of sambal, one would probably suffice for tamer tastebuds, then ran it thru the blender. Perfection!

Followed the recipe except for omitting the fish sauce and using dried ginger instead of pickled, but something about the amounts seems off.  The peanut butter/coconut milk was way too thick. It didn't get melty as it heated, just seemed to get thicker (more so than the peanut butter right out of the jar. I used Skippy Natural). I ended up having to add lots more coconut milk just to get it close to the right consistency.  I think the extra coconut milk may have diluted the other flavors too much though because I found this pretty bland for peanut sauce. I like the ingredients and I will tinker with this recipe again, but I wonder if I'd be better off with doubling everything but the peanut butter?

Believe it or not, I had all the ingredients for this sauce in my house.  But my peanut butter never melted, after I stirred in the coconut milk, it turned a dark caramel color and sat there looking lumpily up at me.  So I had to whisk in quite a bit more coconut milk to thin it out.  I increased the amount of Asian curry powder, garlic and sesame oil.  And I added some red pepper flakes, lime juice, cilantro and green onions.  The sauce came out great, and I'm serving it with Thai Chicken Balls from this site.  Thanks for the post!

Thickened this up after using it to marinate chicken and served it as a sauce with sprinkled chopped peanuts as a garnish, very nice indeed

Great peanut sauce recipe -- tastes just like the one my Thai friends make for us.  I added twice as much coconut milk for a more "runny" sauce.  My kids loved dipping their sticky rice balls in this sauce, and so did I!

I made this as a dipping sauce and I thought it was great!  I added fresh ginger along with the pickled ginger since I love ginger so much.

The taste was perfect ! I added cilantro which worked really well, the only problem was it was too runny.

The sauce was extremely thick and just tasted a lot like peanut butter.  I would recommend cutting the peanut butter in half, but I am pretty sure there must be a better recipe out there for this sauce.

This peanut sauce is divine!! I omitted the pickled ginger and while it simmered on the stove I did add a cup or two of water so it didn't get too thick. It turned out perfect! I served it with chicken satay skewers that had marinated in the same sauce overnight for guests and they raved about the dinner! Definitely a must make again in the future! :)

Seemed too thick with recipe here so I added almost 1/4 cup extra coconut milk and the consistency was much better.
