I liked the idea of this soup, but I didn't like cooking all of it together.  The meat stuck to the bottom of the pot at first, so I had a tough time getting it all mixed together.  So, for a second time, I would brown both meats together and then drain them, then saute the veggies (onion, carrots, both peppers, and garlic)on their own, and then finally add everything together and simmer for 30-40 minutes.  That would still only take one pot, and you can drain off more fat and not worry about a mess on the bottom of the pan!  The taste was great, however.  I used beef stock because that is what I had, and also added 1 can of great northern beans for more fiber.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe except I used bulk sausage instead of links. I'd even be willing to skip the ground beef altogether, the sausage seemed to be enough.  If you like it hot, don't remove the ribs and seeds from the jalapeno but if you don't make sure you clean them out well. Our family loves heat! Two out of the 4 of us have the sniffles and this was great to help clear those sinuses. Yummy!

Has a really nice kick to it for a cold day.  I didn't put corn in (my Hubby is getting tired of corn in all the soups) and I accidentally minced everything instead of chopping it ... but it really is an excellent soup.  The one thing I will do differently next time is used ground sausage ... the fresh sausage is too tough to cut and make look good.  The flavor will all be there, but I will just have to brown it grounded together.  We will be making this again.

Soup is very good.  I altered it though and the prep time took me about 30 minutes.  I took the sausage out of the casing and browned it with the beef.  Added some black pepper with the meat while browning.  Added 1 and 3/4 cup carrots to increase the veggies and added a can of black beans to the mix (rinse the beans with cold water).  Very very good - had my co-workers all try it and had very good reviews.
