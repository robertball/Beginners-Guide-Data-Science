I've been drinking this for years and it's SO refreshing and the perfect vitamin boost when you're feeling a little under the weather. It has the perfect amount of sweetness, so no need to add anything else. I often cut down the recipe (1/2 pound of carrots + 2 oranges)and its just enough for one serving. Also very tasty with a small piece of ginger added. Delicious!

This was my first juice recipe and I love it! I added 3 large pieces (about 1 inch in diameter) of peeled ginger root. So good!

Not bad at all. Certainly not what I had expected juicing the carrots with the orange so to my surprise it was a perfect juice! Thanks for the recipe :)

I really loved this- my first time with the juicer.  We had 3 oranges and 3 carrots total and it had good balanced taste.

I have been doing this recipe for a long time but I add Ginger! it makes a big difference.  Also always add more carrots than oranges. I actually store in a big juice container, it's good for 2 days.

This was alright. Although  I peeled the oranges, the white membrane surrounding each section of orange made the juice a little bitter. If I were doing this again, I would make orange juice using a citrus juicer and then mix it with carrot juice made in a juicer. I was amazed at how fast it was to do this though.
