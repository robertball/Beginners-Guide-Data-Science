I rated this in the middle, but after my revisions, it would be 5 *'s.  Use only 1 cup confectioner's sugar, use butter instead of margarine, add a second stick of melted butter to the lemon mixture, and top with 3 ounces sliced almonds.

I also used butter instead of margarine - and I used less powdered sugar. I was searching for this recipe because we used to make it all the time but I couldn't find mine and I couldn't remember how many eggs. We've never used pecans, so I didn't today, but perhaps next time! Our family and friends love this gooey bar - as do starving, homesick college kids and now starving, overwhelmed med school students!!!

This was my first attempt at making lemon bars and these were excellent, made exactly as recipe suggested and they were easy to make and turned out great!  They disappeared at our school carnival!!! Would be good as Gooey Butter Bars if you used yellow cake mix instead of lemon!!

Really tasty.  I also used butter because that is what I had in the freezer. These were very quick to make. Next time, I think sme lemon zest with the lemon cake mix would be good as well as reducing the sugar
