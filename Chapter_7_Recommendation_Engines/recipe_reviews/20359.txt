This soup is very good and healthy. I took advice of other reviewer and  used the coconut milk instead of heavy cream, I think it would be really bland without it.  The directions said to strain the vegetables and throw away excess vegetable broth?!  This makes no sense thats where the vitamins are not to mention I bought good stock and it is not cheap.  So I used less broth, I used enough to cover the vegetables which is how it is supposed to be in the end.  I actually used half of the stock called for in the recipe. Instead of straining and separating it I did what I always do with this type of soup recipe and used a hand held blender and put it in the pot and zapped the whole lot.  Save the vitamins and work!!.

I found this soup to be absolutely wonderful.  Most carrot soups I have made previously have had a strong carrot flavour but this particular soup was mellowed with the addition of potatoes.  The dill (I used a 1/4 tps. of dried dill weed,) and the ginger gave the soup a lovely delicate flavour and it is a soup I would heartily recommend.  Love this website!

I made this recipe for an Iron Chef party, and I received the second highest number of votes.  I hate ginger, but it was the "secret" ingredient so I didn't have a choice.  I found this recipe and was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.  The ginger wasn't overwhelming and the dill was a great accent.  I tripled the recipe and added two tablespoons of brown sugar, as well as a teaspoon of chili powder to spice it up a little (I also took the advice of someone on the website and used coconut milk instead.)  I'd make it again.

MAKE THIS LOWER IN FAT AND VEGAN by using light coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  The coconut milk is lovely with the ginger.  I tried it because we're vegan but it sounded like a great recipe and it turned out great! This was a very nice soup!

This recipe is great!  Here's what I did: 1) quadrupled everything except for the broth.
2) substituted chicken broth for veg broth, rosemary for dill, and ground ginger for fresh.
3) also added cinnamon as one reviewer suggested.
4) did not discard any of the broth.
It turned out excellent, and very flavorful.

I followed some of the review ideas, and doubled the ginger root, and used lowfat coconut milk. I added a pinch of cinnamon too. I used sour cream to garnish.  It was by far one of the best soups I have made!

Wow! this was awesome! I tried the coconut milk twice but the heavy cream is much better. I doubled carrots, onion and potato. Also I used 1 1/2 tsp of ginger. Reallly good recipe! Thank you for sharing.

So so so so so  good. I just finished making this and it is wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except just a little extra ginger cause I love it. The only suggestion I have is if you are making this for any amount of people you will have to quadruple the recipe. I doubled it and I only got enough for 3 normal sized bowls of soup. I'm gonna do that tomorrow and freeze a bunch:)

we are not necessarily the vegan vegetable soup types but we loved this!  i almost never make a recipe as written, but this was great.  all i did was the coconut instead of half and half and dried spices instead of fresh, but am sure it is good either way!  the dill is a little overpowering, may skip it next time.  will definitely make again -- thank you!

This soup was AMAZING!  I doubled the recipe and followed the other suggestions:  I used 3 cups stock instead of 4, and light coconut milk instead of cream.  I also didn't have vegetable stock, so used chicken instead, tripled the ginger, didn't have dill, and left some vegetables on the side before pureeing, to give the soup some texture.  With all those changes it was still great, and next time I will make sure I have dill on hand.

this was great, a big hit for a fall party, with bread and cheese and salad. And I did follow the recommendation of using COCONUT MILK instead of cream. Big hit, very tasty. I did not get rid of any broth, etc. just pureed it all, then stirred in the coconut milk. People were impressed because I could call it "vegan".

embarassingly this is my first soup from scratch! and it was well worth it. i used the suggestions from other users and used coconut milk and chilli powder and blended straight in the pot.  i also skipped the dill and added about 1/2 tsp extra ginger to give it kick!  everyone at the dinner party last night loved it!

This is a very good recipe, but not a five star without some revisions. 
For a five star recipe, I revised as follows: 
as most others, I added coconut milk instead of cream. 
I also did not discard the broth! That would be incredibly wasteful of the nutrients in the veggies! 
I did not have any fresh dill, so I added a little dried. 
I used about half of a medium onion and added 2 cloves of garlic. 
I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of curry powder and cayenne pepper. 
The results were spicy and tasty! 
Other than the above revisions, I followed the recipe. Thanks for posting, I will be making this again.

Delicious recipe! To make it a bit healthier, I substituted 1.5 Tbl of Smart Balance Light instead of butter, and used whole milk for heavy cream (and it still tasted sensational). I didn't have fresh dill on hand, but 1 tsp dried was sufficient. Also, rather than taking the time to grate the ginger root I simply peeled a large chunk and let it simmer with the rest of the ingredients, then discarded it before pureeing the mixture - this yielded the desired flavor but saved a bit of work. I simmered the entire mixture for about 30 minutes, adding the dill within the last 10. By simmering the mixture for this long, I did not need to strain the broth. Instead, I let the mixture cool in the fridge, then pureed it with my blender, and followed the last step as it. My final result had a wonderful texture and flavor!

Carrot soup just doesn't get any better than this. The dill and the ginger really take the flavors to the next level. I use soy milk and serve with a dollop of non-dairy sour cream to keep this dish vegan & the most healthy.

Excellent carrot soup recipe! I didn't have potatoes and therefore left them out, adding more carrots instead. I only added enough broth to cover the carrots and once softened, blended the whole thing. I substituted half and half for cream. I will make this again, but play around with the spice amounts.

I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream, a bit less dill than requested, and doubled the recipe... It was super.  Really tasty and filling, and there were barely any leftovers!  And, if you like chunky soups, I didn't puree the veggies all the way, and the texture was great.

I tried this soup and immediately made another batch to freeze for later.  I used a can of light coconut milk and it was just delicious.  This soup tastes like a breath of fresh air.

This was AMAZING! I agree to keep the broth and add Coconut Milk instead of half and half. Its so good that 3 servings is way to little of a batch to make.

ENJOY!

This soup is very good.  I added a little garlic powder, curry, and cayenne pepper.  Like others I did not drain the broth at all.  I used only one can of broth (about 1 3/4 cups).  I think this made it a little thicker which was good.  This is probably one of the best soups I have ever made.

I used coconut milk instead of cream and added curry and it was a big hit.

This soup is heavenly.  The dill and the ginger complement each other perfectly, and elevate this dish from "another root vegetable dish" to an exotic taste experience!

This was a very easy, quick and tasty soup. No leftovers. I would make it again, maybe add a touch more ginger.

This is quite a small quantity -- to have left overs for my little family I tripled the recipe. I shredded the carrots in a food processor (easier) and I used absolutely packed cups of carrot and almost doubled the onion. I used hot water and a chicken stock cube. I didn't have fresh dill so I used 1.5 heaping tsp of dried dill (x3) and added it while the potatoes were cooking. I also added a bit of harissa Arbi (smokey style) for extra kick -- could be added at the table to people's taste. I bulked out the soup with some large grain bulghur which I cooked on the side. And I garnished it with fresh chopped cilantro. Delicious!

A wonderful soup that I doubled and should have tripled, otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  My plan is to make this soup a day ahead to meld the flavors and any leftover soup  (of which there will be none) I will freeze.   In addition I plan to freeze the "leftover" both to make other soups, plus as another writer has noted, there are many vitamins and minerals in the remaining both why throw that goodness out?

It was great. I changed a few things. A few less carrots for some chopped celery.  Coconut milk instead of milk and sweet potato for the cubed potato. Finally I simply used a hand held emulsion blender to purée the soup.

This was ok but kind of bland. I added a bit more dill and even a dash of cinnamon to make it more exciting - which helped - but I wouldn't make this again.

This is a very good recipe and I enjoyed it. I would recommend using slightly less dill, but a good combination overall. My family of 3 recently had a cooking "competition", and I used this recipe. It was perfect because there was 1 cup for each of us, enough to taste. Everyone loved it!

Delicious and easy recipe! Substituted lowfat coconut milk for the heavy cream and doubled the recipe, as others had suggested. Could've actually tripled the recipe and still not have quite enough. Plan to make it again later in the week, since I bought a big bag of carrots.

I made this soup as written with the exception of the fresh dill. I did not have any on hand so I used dried dill. NOT the same! It still tastes pretty good but the colour is way off (it is darker with a lot of green dill speckles in it). If you are going to use dried dill, reduce the amount of dill called for in the recipe. I would make this again but I would definitely use fresh dill. I might try it with the coconut milk too as other reviewers have suggested.

Just made this recipe tonight, but had to up the ingredients a bit since I had to feed 6 people.  I actually used 2 lbs. of carrots, 1/4 cup chopped dill and 6 cups chicken stock instead of the vegetable stock, and everything else was x4.  It came out very creamy and just outstanding! I had never tasted carrot soup before. There was just a hint of the dill, not overpowering and it really is one of the "secret" ingredients to making this soup great.  We ate it with regular old Saltine crackers and my teen age kids loved it, even having seconds...thirds too (daughter).  I will definately be keeping this recipe and making it again.  Can't wait to introduce it to dinner guests maybe as a side dish!

Great soup!  I doubled the recipe and made changes based on reviews.  I used chicken stock, but much less than the recipe called for, probably about half or less and didn't discard any.  I substituted coconut milk for the cream, and used a bit more ginger, and added about 3 small cloves of minced garlic.  Turned out really good and I will definitely be making this again.  Husband really liked it also which is really surprising since he's not a fan of vegetables and particularly carrots!

This was the first time I have made carrot soup so can't compare to other recipes, but I thought it was delicious! I doubled the recipe and used evaporated milk instead of cream, and dried dill (about 1 tsp) , otherwise everything else was the same.

Very good and fun to make. I quadrupled the recipe but only used 2 cups of broth like many suggested and replaced a cup of the carrots for a cup of celery. I also added cayenne and maybe a bit too much, it was really spicy but I like a dollop (or more) of sour cream and that cuts the heat. I would have cut the dill in half, it kind of over-powered the soup. I think a covering of dill as a garnish would have been enough and more presentable.

I had a lot of carrots to use, so I did as some suggested and quadrupled the recipe but stayed with the original rec for broth and did not discard.  To reduce the sodium, I made my own vegetable broth with boullion, and used a low sodium butter substitute, as well substituted the cream with low fat coconut milk.  I also added some sweet red pepper.  I don't like dill, so I added half rosemary / half cilantro as others had noted and a lot of cayenne and black pepper as well as some cinnamon.  I would also add much more ginger next time, but overall, an excellent fall soup!

This recipe is OK as a starting point, but I think I'd have been disappointed if I'd made it as written.  I just about doubled the recipe, and it still only made what I'd consider 3 servings.  I also used light coconut milk in lieu of heavy cream, veggie bouillon and potato water instead of broth, and a dash of cinnamon.  Came out a little thin but tasty.

This soup is wonderful! I have made it about 5 times and it turned out great every time.  I have made it with coconut milk a few times and regular milk (even non-fat/skim)a few times as well, both were very good. I will definitely continue to use this recipe!

Just finished eating this, and it was so so delicious. My husband says it was the soup ever! I loved it too. The flavors were so delicate and just meshed well. I just substituted fresh dill for about 1/3 tbsp of dried dill weed. I will definately save this recipe for Thanksgiving!

substituted heavy cream with coconut milk which made the taste so delicious. next time would double the ginger as was not strong enough for us. took advice of others and usd half stock - actually prefer to serve this as a puree and not a soup (ie leave out the cream or coconut and just blend carrots / potatos / dill / ginger with the cooking stock - delicious!)

this is one of the best soup recipes I have come across, my boyfriend is vegetarian and I made this for one of the courses for his b-day dinner and he loved it and now begs me to make it often.  I use whole milk though to cut down on a bit of the fat instead of cream

My very picky husband loved it -although it did only use 1/3 of the fresh dill called for in the recipe.  Great comfort food and very filling.

I always very things so I made this the 2nd time a bit different...  doubled receipe. tripled ginger.  Kept about 1 C carrots once tender, diced and added in at the end along with blanched spinch.  Also added 1 tbl spn Shan Vegatable Curry, 1tsp vinegar 1tsp lime juice.  Very asian but a bit more hardy.

Great soup! I followed the suggestion to add coconut milk instead of cream, and I used chicken stock instead of vegetable (I kept all of the stock in rather than throw it out). Also I added some hot curry powder.

I have made this several times. The first time, yes it did not yield enough to go to all the hassle, so I started doubling it. I have not tried it with the coconut milk, but that sounds good. Also, it does need more gingeroot than what is called for. You can you dried dill if you are on a budget. They charge $3.00 for fresh dill out here in La Jolla, CA!
