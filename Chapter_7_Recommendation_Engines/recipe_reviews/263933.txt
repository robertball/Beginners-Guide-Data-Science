Loved the flavour! This method lets the flavour of the mussels shine through just as it should.  I used 3 pounds of mussels, soaked in a bowl of water for an hour,  but otherwise followed the recipe, cooking just enough pasta for 2. I'm not sure if this would be enough for 4 servings. Thanks for sharing.
