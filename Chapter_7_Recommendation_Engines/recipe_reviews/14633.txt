This is really good. My Mexican boyfriend loved it and that is a huge compliment! Beware it is pretty spicy.

Made this for dinner last night it was really good... Used pablanos instead of bell peppers and made added some cayenne to the meat while frying to make it hotter... Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today!

I used canned tomatoes in place of Mexican style tomato sauce. Both my husband and I really liked this dish.
