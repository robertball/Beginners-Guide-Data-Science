Wow! These cupcakes are fantastic! With or without the frosting, the cake is absolutely perfect! I tend to not like chocolate cake or cupcakes much, but these cupcakes had the right amount of sweetness and the cinnamon was a very nice touch. I made the recipe as is and I will be making these again and again! Thanks for the recipe!
