Phenomenal banana bread recipe! Very flavorful, moist and full of great banana flavor. I only made a couple minor mods to the original recipe: I cut the butter down to 2 tbl., only used 1/2 c. brown sugar and substituted whole wheat four for the AP. With the flour switch, I was nervous that the texture would be 'off,' but I was wrong! It turned out super moist and perfect...and the sweetness from the 4 bananas more than made up for the brown sugar I cut out. Excellent recipe...will definitely make it again and again!

I lightened this bread up just a touch--not by much. I got 12 large muffins and 8 mini-muffins. 350 for 20 minutes for the large muffins and 10 minutes for the mini-muffins. Very moist and lightly spiced. Is there anything more comforting than homemade banana bread?

This is a very good banana bread!  The first time I made it, it didn't turn out so well.  The second time was much better.  I beat the butter (real, usalted) and sugar a lot longer and used 3 large bananas.  I use skim milk and dark brown sugar, since that's what I had on hand, and 1/4 tsp. regular salt instead of kosher.  I found that it took about 60 minutes to bake, instead of 40.  The bread still didn't rise that much, but at least it didn't sink in the middle like the last time!  I made a topping of 3 Tbsp. brown sugar mixed with 1 tsp. cinnamon.  The thing I like most about this bread is the "soft" texture, which must be attributed to the brown sugar.

Bread tastes great! Made recipe this afternoon. Like the idea of putting soft bananas in a zip-type bag and smashing. Recipe took a bit longer to make then stated, but turned out so much better this time. The first time loaf ended up in the trash; I mixed milk & egg while cold - bread sank in middle after removing from oven. This afternoon mixing brown sugar and butter took 14 minutes rather than 1-2 minutes. Using an Oster stand mixer; I mixed on the #10 setting (grind) for 10 minutes, holding bowl with one hand to keep it from spinning too fast. Added 4 minutes on #5 (whip setting). Mix didn't get fluffy, but was light. Brought milk and egg to room temperature (abt 1 hr). Items blended much better than using cooler ingredients like the 1st time. Lowered speed to #3 (puree) and combined last 4 items; batter looked more like rippled waves on a beachfront rather than being smooth. Before pouring mix into loaf pan, I hand mixed batter with spatula to get bits of mashed bananas to smooth out. Baking time was about 43 min. Finished loaf tasted great after cooling a bit, but much better after being in frig 4-5 days. Tastes great by self, or putting a light coat of butter or dopple of whipped cream on slice. (Hard to stop at one piece.) Not overly sweet; just right for folks who don't tolerate a sweet sugary taste. I'm glad I gave this recipe a second chance.

I couldn't wait to review!!  I wanted to review before it was done but I held on.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  After 40 minutes it looked beautiful and smelled even better, but the toothpick came out WET!  I thought I did something wrong.  I put it back in another 10 minutes and still wet.  I came back to read the reviews and was so relieved to see so many other people say it took 60 minutes or more.  WHEW!  I put some foil over top so my beautiful brown crust on top wouldn't burn and turned the oven off, then put it back in and just let it set.  Sorry but I didn't pay attention to how long it took, I was doing dishes.  The pick came out clean when it took it out.  It's moist and so yummy (I ate it warm, it was too tempting!).  Oh, I did make one teeny addition... after I put it in the pan I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top for the sparkly crusty top.  That's it!  YUMM!

Excellent! Baked for 60 minutes in an air-bake pan; 40 minutes wasn't enough. Very moist-one of the best banana breads I've made. I tried this recipe because I was out of white sugar and had bananas to use up. Added a handful of chocolate chips to the mix for fun and sprinkled oats mixed with brown sugar on top before I baked it. I will make this again.

This is the best banana bread I have ever had or made.  Very moist.  I doubled the recipe and used a large loaf pan, a regular loaf pan and a large muffin pan.  The regular loaf pan turned out perfect at 40 minutes, the muffins were perfect at 20 minutes and the large pan had to cook to long for the bottom of the bread to survive.

Followed recipe except for adding pecans and it turned out perfect.  I doubled the recipe and it made three 3x7 disposable loaf pans perfectly.  I did have to cook them about 10 minutes longer than called for. Will definitely make again.

A very delicious bread!  I made sure to follow the advice of some of the other reviewers so my bread wouldn't sink in the middle.  I beat my butter and sugar for a good bit, probably about 7-8 minutes.  I also let my egg come up to room temperature before using it and warmed the milk up a bit in the microwave.  I only ended up using 3 medium bananas since that was all I had on hand.  My bread took 50 minutes to bake instead of 40, but came out perfect on the first try!  It had just the amount of banana flavor that I like and was incredibly soft from the brown sugar!  The cinnamon was a great compliment to the bananas as well.  This is a keeper, thanks!

It's not bad, but it did take over an hour to bake as indicated in other reviews. Very moist, but I wasn't wowed by the flavor.

This is a good banana bread that stays moist.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it's high on the list.  It did take 65 minutes, however.

This bread was very moist, had just the right amount of sugar, and tasted scrumptuous. The banana flavor really shined through; I added some chocolate chips and chopped walnuts, which gave it an interesting texture. This is my go-to banana bread recipe from now on. It reminds me of the dominican recipe "Pan de Batata" except you would call this "Pan de Guineo". Tastes exceptional!

came out great with caramelized edges.  I love the flavor and it was super easy to make.  I actually just added all the wet ingredients to the bag when I mushed up the bananas and it worked out well.  It did take closer to 60 minutes to cook.

The first time I made this, I only had three small bananas and it cooked perfectly in the amount of time in the original recipe, but didn't have that intense banana taste. When I made it again with the full amount of bananas, it came out VERY moist and I had to cook it much longer, as other people have mentioned, and it didn't hold together as well. So, this most recent time I used whole wheat flour instead of the AP flour (cup for cup) and it cooked closer to the 40 minutes and held together better. I do like it denser. I also sprinkled some turbinado (raw) sugar across the top. Despite the multiple tries, it was an easy recipe to follow and adjust, and tasted delicious each time.

really good! I added 1/4-1/2 cup choco chips, 1 melted semi sweet square of baking chocolate, and 1/2 c chopped nuts to the recipe.   I put the batter in a oversized muffin pan and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar and baked for ~30min

I made this banana bread today. It turned out very well. I followed the recipe very closely. The only thing I added was 1 cup of chopped walnuts. I also baked mine in a muffin tin. The muffins were done in about 30 minutes.

Since bananas vary in size, I used 4 ripe bananas. I mashed mine with a fork just as I usually do. I measured them. I had just a little over one cup.

The flavor is excellent. The muffins are very tender.

This is now my favorite banana bread recipe.

The aroma of this banana bread baking told me it was going to be something totally wonderful! And I was not mistaken! The only thing is it has to bake extra, but that just adds to that wonderful aroma! Yum also on the eating part! So moist and delicious! Thanks D Family!

Excellent and moist. My only changes was to decrease the brown sugar to just 1c and I used fat free half and half instead of whole milk. I also use 5 smallish /med bananas. Delicious!

I hate when people rate a recipe after making changes to it, but here I go anyway..... I actually searched specifically for a banana bread recipe with brown sugar so i could use the splenda brown sugar blend for a coworker that has to watch his sugar and starch intake.  I made this bread using the splenda and I used 1 1/2 cups of almond flour and a half cup regular flour and let me tell you, it was better than the full sugar banana cake I made for everyone else!! My 19 year old son asked me to make another "diet" one for the house! I've subbed out the almond flour in a few different recipes, but this one has worked out the best so far.

I think that it turned out really good and I loved that it was so moist and soft but each time I did 4 bananas it turned out to about 60-65 minuets and when I used 3 bananas it was about 45-50 minuets. But the down side of doing 3 bananas is it turned out more dry. Other than that it was AMAZING!!!

I made no changes exactly, but I used bananas that I had been saving in the freezer. Coworkers have complimented my work.

UPDATE: I have made this four times now. Over time, I have reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup and use 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. 

I added about 1/4 of quick oats once, but reduced the amount of flour by the same. I think I would not reduce the flour next time, but try the oats still.

(I added cannabis once, which works nicely, but one has to resist the urge to gobble up this wonderful treat in that case).

I just made this banana bread after searching for a recipe that calls for brown sugar. ( All I had in the cupboard)
1st, I don't understand the point of the bananas in the ziplock bag? What a hassle for nothing, just mash them with a fork before adding. 
2nd, bake time is WAYYY off, ive never heard of a load baking in 40 minutes so I was very surprised. Of course, it took just a little over an hour.
3rd, ill add in some pros, unlike other comments I found the flavours to be good, the inside was moist, but the outside was tough, not even crusty like a crusty bread, just hard to chew. Followed the recipe exactly except for adding a tin foil tent so it didn't burn with the longer cooking time, so I am slightly disappointed. but in all, the bread looks nice and inside is moist, flavors good.

What a wonderful banana bread this recipe is!  I was pressed for time so I just added my peeled bananas to the mixing bowl and mixed all the wet ingredients together. I only had 2 Tbsp of butter handy, so I compensated some extra moisture by adding 1 container of honey-flavored Noosa yogurt, 1 squeeze pouch of cinnamon applesauce, and 1/4 c of coconut oil. To the flour mixture, I added a tad more cinnamon than called for, and a couple shakes of both nutmeg and cloves.  I also added about 3/4 c of pecans to the batter. Since I added extra ingredients, I had to split the batter into two 9x5" pans, which worked beautifully. I baked for 1 hour at 350 degrees and got the perfect rise and consistency that I've been searching for in a banana bread, including the slight crunch in the crust. The brown sugar element is really good, and going forward, this will replace my old recipe!  Give this one a try - - you won't be disappointed!

Very pleased!!  I was worried because I couldn't find the  attachments to my mixer (recently moved) so had to do it using a little old fashion elbow grease.  I also ended up using dark brown sugar instead of light since that is all I had. I also added crumbled pecans and a cinnamon sugar sprinkle to the bottom, before pouring it in, and to the top. Since I didn't have a mixer, I just mixed all the wet ingredients and dry ingredients separately and then slowly added the dry to the wet and it turned out fine.  So glad because again, I was worried.  Only thing I noticed is, it took more like 70 min to cook. Either way, I'm happy!

I loved it and so did my family! What I did differently was mix all the wet ingredients together. Then pour that into the dry ingredients. I didn't find it necessary to mix the brown sugar with the butter nor smash the bananas in a bag. I just mixed them up with a fork. ?? It turned out great and there was no sinking in the middle like some others experienced. Also baked it for 60 minutes like everyone else. I think I will try it with walnuts next time. Yum! ??

The basic recipe has an error. Every banana bread recipe on earth for this batch size calls for 2 eggs. That may have something to do with the "gloppy middle" others have reported. I halved this recipe and baked it in a casserole dish in a toaster oven (using 1 egg & 375F) and it came out perfectly at 40 min bake time. My wet ingredients were cold, contrary to cake-baking 101. I added a little more flour until the batter had the right consistency. Also, 1 cup brown sugar is enough (1/2 in my case), not 1 1/4c. It got a little brown on top, but that's due to the toaster oven element being so close. Flavor was perfect; texture was perfect, and was cooked perfectly all the way through. I added walnuts.

This is one of my favourite banana bread recipes, every time I have made it its turned out moist and flavourful. However, both times I have made this recipe the cook time of 40 minutes has not been sufficient. Rather I have found that the cook time of 1 hour works better to unsure the bread is cooked all the way through.

I love this recipe.  It's moist & flavorful.  I don't bake it as 1 loaf b/c I get either a doughy center or burnt edges.  I would recommend splitting the batch into 2 loaves.  You could also do what I do & make 8 mini loaves.  This makes portions so I don't overeat like a PIG!  This bread is so good & the loaves freeze so I can make multiple batches at once.

Love this recipe! I love using brown sugar however I was out so i used regular sugar and used a 1/2 cup of wheat flour along with the 1 1/2 cup of flour. So I made some adjustments. But still was moist and delicious I think it has to do with the cinnamon and vanilla. Next time I will do the recipe exact and I bet I only like it more.

This recipe sounded yummy.  I made it exactly like the recipe says but added 2oz. of chopped walnuts and a dash of nutmeg.  It's baking in the oven now but the batter was delicious!  I'm sure it's gonna be awesome!

I'm going to have to go with meh on this one. Something with the way it Cooks that is not fluffy or flavorful. It's very sense as opposed to light and flavorful.  I gave it three stars mainly because there may be folks that like their bread thick like this, but not me.

Amazing banana bread that got rave reviews from friends and family (one of them being a head cook at a nice inn and also a baker) ... I've made it both ways with light and brown sugar and it really comes down to how sweet you like it. Each time as others have said  it takes about an hour and not 40 minutes to bake.

The step with mashing bananas in a seperate bag is definitely an extra step that's not needed of you have VERY RIPE bananas if you are using firk bananas this may be where the extra step is necessary but old banana are always better.

This is almost like my Grandma's recipe (which is the BEST ever, lol). In her recipe you combine the brown sugar, butter, mashed/cut bananas (depending on preference), and pecans (optional) in a sauce pan and carmelize then set aside to cool while the other wet and dry ingredients get prepared. Then mix it all together. Yummy!

This is my favorite banana bread recipe .. I have made it at least a dozen times. To simplify this recipe; I beat my brown sugar and butter, throw in the bananas and whip that in .. add my wet, then my dry .. and bake for about 80 minutes but keep checking .. I believe the whipping of the bananas makes the liquidy batter need more oven. Oh and I can't lie .. I always use a lil extra vanilla, in everything I do :)

This needs to be made in TWO loaf pans, not one. I cooked it 50 minutes, it overflowed all over the oven floor, and was still soupy and uncooked in the middle.

I made the recipe AS IS although I did beat the butter and brown sugar in my stand mixer for a solid five minutes. Batter was beautiful- thick and smooth. Texture after baking was light and moist. Great flavor. Two thumbs up from the hubs and kiddo.

Amazing and moist. I've made this recipe several times now. I'm a little more liberal with the brown sugar and I make it in a 9-10 inch cast iron skillet instead of loaf pans. The cooking time tends to increase a little but I think its more my oven not the pan. While the wife says the taste and texture are the best she's had, she prefers the traditional loaf shape. New traditions I say! Good luck!

I added some chopped nuts and baked about 65 mins.
I also sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on top before I baked. It was so good! Family loved it.

Very good. Just changed the brown sugar to 3/4 cup of brown sugar splenda. Added about 1/2 cup chopped nuts.
Great recipe
Thanks

I made 18 muffins with this recipe. Very delicious but next time I'm going to add chocolate chips (like i always do when making banana bread) to add even more flavor.

I made it& it’s good.   But I would add nuts next time.  I also add twice the amount of cinnamon.
I took it to a gym & shared with friends.  They really liked it too!

Absolutely the best banana bread I've ever made.  It is incredibly moist (something I find to be difficult with most of the banana breads), the spicing is exactly right- not too overpowering of the banana flavor and an excellent mix, and the bread itself is very easy to make.  The true testament was my making it and having my husband, a non-lover of banana bread, eat the ENTIRE loaf within 24 hours!  Great recipe.

Very good recipe! I actually made a dairy-free version, using Myoko’s vegan butter, and almond milk, but needed to increase the baking time to 60 minutes. Will definitely make again!

Very moist bread. I doubled the recipe and froze a loaf. I added about 2cups of toasted pecans to the double recipe. Next time I make it I’ll add extra cinnamon.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out great!!! It was moist and it had the perfect sweetness.  My son tried it, loved it, and took half the bread with him.  I had to make another one.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this today and I love this recipe.  The only thing I did different was to add toasted walnuts.  It did take longer to bake (in my oven anyway), about an hour and 10 minutes.  It did not over bake on top or in the pan.  It really came out perfect.  Nice and moist too.

I thought this was an excellent banana bread recipe but I found it required an extra 10 minutes of baking , could be my oven. Very moist, with a nice crunchy outer layer, definitely would make it again, next time I’m going to add nuts just because that’s how I like it, otherwise I wouldn’t change a thing.

I thought this recipe was good, but not the best I’ve ever made.  First of all, it did take longer to bake, about 15 mins more, a# others have stated. I do attribute part of that to being the size of the loaf pan you use. And perhaps I might have overbaked it a touch (don’ really think so though) but when I first sliced it, it was a bit “crumbly”. Mine came out darker than my standard recipe but you do add cinnamon to this recipe. I don’t think this added anything to the recipe flavor wise. I did add a cup of chopped pecans as my family likes banana nut bread better than “plain”. I will say that once I wrapped it in foil overnight, the bread became more moist, and, after the third day, it was moist and flavorful. Hubs said he liked my other recipe better so I won’t be making this on3 again.

It was good but I prefer my regular banana bread recipe.  It definitely takes longer than 40 minutes to bake, more like 60-70 minutes. Doubtful I will make again.

I was looking for a different banana loaf/bread recipe when I found this one. I made it exactly as listed except I baked it in a bundt pan. The texture and taste was very good however, a little too much cinnamon for my liking.   I will definitely make this recipe again.

Made this to have on hand for after school snacks. It keeps well, and is moist and delicious! My little girls love it. I ended u baking for 60-70 minutes rather than 40. Formed a nice crust delicious did not burn.

One of the best recipes I've ever made. It turned out great. I added pecans.  Used three really ripe and one unripe banana to give it better texture.

The very best banana cake EVER!
I used 2 tsp. vanilla extract, otherwise, made recipe as written.  I used the mixer to puree the bananas & it took about 65 - 70 minutes to bake in my "copper chef" 9 X 5" pan.

Don’t use parchement paper! ?? Oh and given the outcome 40 minutes might be premature. Other recipes call for an hour or more. My efforts following the 40 minute guideline made my banana bread look like cream filled. ??

Very nice and moist though like the other reviewers I had to bake it quite a bit longer than the 40 minutes that was called for. The toothpick wasn’t clean even when I took it out but it turned out ok.

I have only baked a few times in my life. This banana bread is awesome! I made it exactly as the directions call for and it produced 24 muffins, so moist and delicious. My nephews and nieces couldn't believe that their uncle made these!

Made it the first time, come out perfect.  I cut a bit on sugar.  
Sure I will make it again. I want to try adding  up  cranberries or a bit of walnuts. 
Even though it’s great the  way it’s 
Thanks

The problem  with  this recipe, like many of yours, is your vague measurements. 
Four bananas can be 2 cups, three cuos, etc. You need precise measurements in baking.

I reduced sugar slightly than original recipe.
I coated honey butter glazing when bread came out of oven. 
It gives balanced sweetness. I also put the 1/2 cup of chopped walnut in batter. It is really easy and great taste I never have.

I followed the ingredients exactly as written, but I left it in 45 minutes, five minutes longer than called for.  And still it was way underdone.  Ugh.  I would say it needs an hour, just like all my other banana bread recipes.  As far as flavor,  it sounds better than it is.  Not a stand-out.

I have made this bread many many times and I've added different things one of the things I have added was peanut butter just heat up some creamy or crunchy peanut butter in the microwave and then swirl that into your banana bread batter and  you have banana peanut butter bread  also nutella is a good flavor combination and today I've decided I'm going to try adding chunks of pears also if you make them smaller they will cook faster i purchased a mini loaf pan that makes 18 mini loafs at once ( found at joanne fabrics ) and they are cooked in about 20 min and alot easier to serve and share.

Bread was in the oven for an hour and 20 minutes before I gave up and pulled it out. I think this has too much banana in it to cook to the right consistency. I like bread to have at least some kind of crumble to it. This was more like a gelatin in texture. The flavor was fine, it just didn’t cook well. Kids and husband won’t eat it. :(

Sorry, but this was the worst banana bread I have ever eaten. We make banana bread all the time.  After 75 minutes, I pulled it out thinking it was done thru, the center collapsed and was still doughy in the center. We tried to eat the ends but found it to be dry and didn’t taste very good. The more you eat, the worst it tastes. Must be try brown sugar?  There are many other banana bread recipes on here that are much better.

Was easy and delicious. I only had 3 very ripe bananas, so I cut back on the butter (2 Tbsp), the flour (1 3/4 C), and the sugar (1 C).  Baked it in a 9x11 pan because I don't own a loaf tin.  Prepared this way, it should be baked for 30 minutes, then check it, so you don't overbake it.

I searched for a recipe with brown sugar instead of white sugar as I have a recipe that uses the same but I couldn’t find it. This was an excellent recipe! The bread took about an hour to cook, contrary to the directions. I looked the tip to smash the bananas in a baggie and squeeze them into the mixing bowl. Definitely a keeper!

This was good. I followed the recipe as it was written. I just didn't bake it long enough. I'll pay more attention the next time because it's worth making again.

Delicious. Easy to make. And cooking time is exactly right. I used a pampered chef breadloaf stone, lined it with. Parchment paper. Easy cleanup.

Great banana bread recipe! I used white sugar instead of brown as I didn't have enough.  Bread turned out really good with great banana flavour.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again!

I was so excited about this recipe since I could not find one that had both cinnamon and vanilla in the ingredients.  I added four ripe bananas, but since I had no 'measurement' for it, such as 2 cups, the bread never baked through.  I baked for over an hour and no luck.  I will try again with measuring the smashed bananas before hand to ensure it is not too much.  However, the batter tasted wonderful, just the end result was disappointing.

This might be my new favorite banana bread recipe!  I followed recipe exactly, only adding some chopped hazelnuts on top.  Yum!

I made this  brown sugar banana bread today.  Only change was a little less cinnamon.  It is very, very good.  I used Pam in my glass baking dish.  No sticking.  Moist and yummy.  I baked about 60 minutes.  Put a tent of foil to keep from getting too brown the last 15 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Instead of  milk I added some sweetened condensed milk that I had instead and my kids LOVED It, I added a  brown sugar/organic sugar mixture to the top after it came out of the oven and it had a little sugary crunch!  I also put them in mini loaf pans and they took about the same time to cook!

Today I am making the same recipe with a can of pumpkin puree that we found in the pantry from Thanksgiving!

I used 3 overripe bananas and 1 perfectly ripe. I only had 2 tab of butter and used 1/2 cup brown sugar like a previous reviewer suggested. I felt adventurous and threw in 1/4 c old-fashioned oats. I was also out of vanilla and by the time the pan made it to the oven I was nervous. As expected, the bread was short and dense and took longer to bake (18 mins longer?!) but FLAVORFUL! Moist! Nicely textured!   Next time, no oats and hopefully I'll have vanilla.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've made. Super moist and flavorful - it has a dense cake-like texture. I made a few modifications due to not having a few exact ingredients. I used regular brown sugar instead of light, and I didn't have whole milk, so I used about 2/3 cup vanilla Siggi's yogurt. I also had to bake for about 60 minutes. Amazing! I may make this again this week.

This was delicious! I used one cup brown sugar and substituted almond milk (that's what I had on hand) with a little whole fat plain yogurt.  I also used 1 cup of oatmeal flour mixed with all purpose flour (I didn't have enough regular flour on hand either :)  I made into 12 muffins, cooked about 20 minutes.  It was super moist!

Just made this banana bread recipe and got a large loaf and 5 muffins...they smell and taste delicious! I added almonds and dried cranberries to give a healthy twist for a filling breakfast. Thank you I will be doing this one time and again. Michelle

I have never made banana bread before, and for a first time, this was great! I maybe kinda sorta didn't follow all the instructions (aka mixing all the ingredients at once) but it still came out fantastic! I was a little short of banana, so I only used one. I think That might have been the reason why it was a little dry, but my mistake! Great quick recipe. :D

If you plan on making only one loaf, be sure to use about 2 1/2 - 3 bananas. If you cut down the serving size, it will tell you to use 4. It was good, but it turned out really gooey inside. Also maybe cut down on the butter on this. 
Still good! I added coconut flakes inside, and topped the batter with some coconut as well and dribbled some brown sugar.

As most reviews have said....this takes more than 40 min to bake in a loaf pan, in fact the picture shown looks like it was baked in a cake pan as well....I will not make this again, too fussy as well, I am still waiting to take my from the oven after 65 min.

Needs to bake more than 40 minutes.  Moist, but nothing in flavour to make this stand out from other banana breads.

This recipe is very moist. I have been making banana bread for years and thouht I would step out of my usual recipe and give this one a try. I made them into muffins instead of loaf and baked for 20 min at 350. They turned out perfect!

After nearly 50 min. In a 350 degree oven, the middle was still gooey!  Part that was done was good but threw away 2/3 !  Will not make this again.
