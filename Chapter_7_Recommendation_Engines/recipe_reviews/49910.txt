My family loves strawberries, but the thought of putting them in the oven did not appeal to me.  The aroma while baking was pleasant.  It was excellent.  My son enjoyed it so much, he had to take it to go so he wouldn't miss out on his share.  Topping with a little whipped cream or vanilla ice cream added to this heavenly delight.

WOW!! This a great dish using day old bakery french bread cubes!!!  I halved the recipe and used a regular sized loaf pan.  I let the bread sit with the berries about 20 minutes before combining with other ingredients.  As per another reviewer's suggestion I added some ground cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves. I think this really gave added flavor to this dish. Sooo goood!!!!  After baking, I had no soggy spots are crusty edges.  I've never like bread pudding before because of the raisins and the eggy taste.  But, this recipe is very tasty!  I will be making this again since it is strawberry season now.

This recipe will be one of my standards from now on! Fantastic! I did change a couple of things.  To make sure it is not soupy make sure the bread is very dry. I put it in the oven for 10 minutes. I also add 4 eggs instead of 3. I make it in a larger pan 9 x 12 and add more bread and strawberries and I add fresh blueberries. I don't increase the milk and cream except I use 1 cup cream.  I think the cream is important for richness.  I decrease sugar to 1/2 c.  Comes out perfect and can be reheated just before serving if done earlier.  I also keep  it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before baking. I did it in the morning and left it 6 hours in the refrigerator and it was great.

This recipe was beautiful.  It is sweeter than standard bread pudding, and I only used 2/3 cup of sugar.  I also substituted strawberry yogurt for the cream.  My entire family loved this pudding and it was pretty much gone in 24 hours.

This had great flavor!  I used half of a loaf of leftover french bread.  I also had to bake it for an additional 15-20 minute and it was still a little mushy.  But, overall we really liked it, especially served with vanilla ice cream!

This is a family favorite in our home. I usually double the recipe using: 4 Tbsps of butter, a 1 lb. loaf of brad, 2 cups of sliced fresh strawberries, 2 cups milk, 1 cup fat free Half & Half, 1/2 cup low sugar strawberry jam or fruit spread, 1 cup Splenda, and 1 Tbsp vanilla baked in a 9x13" baking dish. I've also substituted 1/2 cup mashed banana for the strawberry fruit spread for s delicious Strawberry Banana Bread Pudding. If you like strawberries, you'll love this recipe!!

i just threw in plussed up ingredients into a bigger pan, estimating the amounts.  this turned out excellent.  the key was adding fresh strawberries and melted chocolate chips to the top.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I only had cinnamon raisin bread on hand, so that's what I used.  The slices were larger then the 1 oz. slices called for but I still found that the middle was not cooked well enough.  Be ware that you may need to add more bread - or it could be because I was not using plain, white bread.

This was a good bread pudding, and such a lovely pink color.  My husband particularly like this dessert, I found it a little sweet, but I will definitely be making this again.

WOW!!  Thank you.   What a great bread pudding!  I used Strawberry/rhubarb preserves and 1/2 cup sugar.  And I baked it for nearly an hour.  PURE PERFECTION!

I made it last night and it turned out very well. I made few changes to the original recipe like e.g. I combined all the steps mentioned in point 2 into 1. Using an electrical blender I mixed in the strawberry preserve, milk, cream, vanilla essence, sugar, toasts and a pinch of cinnamon powder. Then I poured the mixture in the pan that was greased with melted butter. I sprinkled the fresh cut strawberries in it and then kept it for baking.  It took 60 minutes for the pudding to be ready. The family loved it . I served it with cream and strawberry sauce.

I cut the sugar to half a cup, increased the strawberries to a whole cup and used a day old baguette. Served with fresh strawberries, blueberries and creme fraiche. Amazing!

This was just OK for me... not bad, but not great either.  I think I might like it better if I didn't use the strawberry jam.  It came out as a pink blob.  I think it might look better if it looked more golden, like regular bread pudding, with strawberry slices marbled throughout.  I might try it again without the jam and maybe honey in place of the jam.

This turned out to be very, very good. Just the right texture for bread pudding and the strawberry tastre was great. I think the recipe is very forgiving because i cut the ingredients down by 2/3rds. for four people and used more bread and less milk (no cream)and more strawberries and a little less sugar as well. Cooked it for 30 inutes in a 350 oven.

I looove bread pudding and this tasted exactly as the title says, strawberries and cream but in a bread pudding!  It was so good!  I made this with some strawberries that was starting to go bad.  So to use them all up I added more than the recipe stated.  I did notice that the extra strawberries made extra juice in the bottom, so I needed to cook a little longer.  I don't like my bread puddings dry and this had enough liquid in it to make it nice and creamy but with a slightly crunchy top.  I also didn't want any extra calories from the melted butter, so I just sprayed my dish with cooking spray and it was fine.  I let it sit for about 15 minutes to set up and sprinkled liberally with powdered sugar when plating.  This would also be good with some thinly sliced almonds sprinkled on top while baking to give an extra crunch.  Thanks for this great bread pudding!

Was really excited to see this recipe. I can strawberry perserves (jam) every year w/big chunks of strawberries. Had everything to make including the preserves from last yr I needed to use because strawberry season is upon us...but no fresh strawberries..however I had fresh rasberries. Only change I made was to use 1 cup of fresh rasberries in place of the strawberry's and I added 1 cup of sugar to offset the tartness of the rasberries.....never ever have I made bread pudding without sauce but this one needed nary a thing...i will make this again...can't wait till the Louisiana strawberries are ready!!! This was "Berry" Good!!!

This was very yummy and easy.  I let it sit in the fridge for 20 minutes to give the bread a chance to soak up the custard.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg...good choices.  Cut back on the sugar 1/4 cup or so if you are using very sweet preserves.

Fabulous! I used sugar-free strawberry preserves, put my bread in the oven at 200 to dry out (not toasted), and threw in an extra piece of bread and baked closer to an hour to ensure no sogginess.  My parents owned a restaurant when I was growing up and customers came in just for my mother's homemade bread pudding.  I never thought I'd have better bread pudding than Mom's... until now... :)

I didn't have strawberries so I made this using thawed frozen raspberries and raspberry jam.  Perfect amounts of sweetness and moistness.  It was absolutely delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I wasn't real impressed with this desert and since my kids took one bite and that was it I will not be making it again. I thought it tasted ok but I guess I expected something a little more.

As good luck would have it, I decided to use up an some fresh fruit and we had unexpected company stop by while this was in the oven. It came out almost perfect. I used white sandwich rolls which I left out to dry for two hours; I cut the sugar to 3 heaping tbsp and increased the strawberries to just over a cup. I let the whole thing soak for 20 minutes before cooking. I got rave reviews but we agreed that adding a little cinnamon &/or cloves or using cinnamon raisin bread would have given it that extra punch. All in all, a great recipe. Thanks!

Very good but it's hard to go wrong w/ bread pudding? ;o) I used very stale raisin bread from a bakery & I let it sit for about 30 minutes, before baking,  to allow time for my stale bread to soak up the egg mixture. I also layered mine into individual ramekins so that I could turn them out but the strawberry juices made the bread an unappetizing color ( wasn't nearly as pretty as Asli Onser's photo...good job Asli!) so I popped them back in the ramekins. I served them w/ a dollop of whipped cream. Thansk for the recipe, Trisha!

terrific. but theres sumthin wrong w my strawberries. the strawberries leaking during the baking process. the 1st time i cut it, it was waterry inside. then i refrigerate it, it seems okay now.
i didnt use any sugar, i add more jam. and i top it with melted chocolate and made strawberry sauce as follows: boil 200 cc of commercial apple juice with 1 tbsp of  cornstartch. remove from heat, mixed it with 3/4 cup of fresh strawberry puree and few drop of almond essence.
tastes so great!

I made this today because I had some cream I wanted to "get rid of". I didn't have strawberry preserves so I used boysenberry syrup. It is SO good! I absolutely loved this bread pudding. A nice change from the traditional style.

This was REALLY great. I asked for some day old or stale bread at the bakery counter. They only had a bag of  bread croutons - which were really crunchy so I hoped they wouldn't be to dry. They worked great. So I doubled my recipe and made it in a 9x13. Used coconut oil spray instead of butter. I upped the strawberries (can never have to many), also added about a tsp or so of cinnamon based on other reviews, and 1/2 cup of sugar. SO good. Since my bread was so dry, I made it a few hours before it needed to go in the oven and just kept it in the fridge. I cooked it for 50 minutes because it was such a big pan. It was PERFECT. Moist, not runny, perfect flavour. :) We'll definitely make this again.

Soo good!  Substituted nonfat milk for the cream; was a little watery so might decrease the milk next time.  Also added 1/2 cup more strawberries.

I love bread pudding and like strawberries, but didn't like the combination.  The strawberries really get mushy and any leftovers are not too appetizing.

Great!  Had day old croissants, which really made this a very buttery and rich bread pudding. Also, increased the strawberries to 2 cups.  Will try with other berries when in season.

One of the best bread pudding recipes I have tried.  I didn’t have any strawberry preserves so I used raspberry jam.  I also cut the sugar down a bit.  I’ll definitely be making this again.

I love strawberries as well so thought to try this on my daughter and son-in-law and grandchildren.  I doubled recipe and only used 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty.  The kids all loved it with just a little ice cream on top. But I thought it was just OK. Thanks TGagne

I love bread pudding and strawberries. Living by myself it is sometimes hard to use up a pound of berries before they start to go bad. This a great recipe. You can add more berries than the recipe calls for and it will not effect the outcome. You will just have more berries to enjoy! Very easy to make and can be served room temp or warm. I made a strawberry sauce to spoon over the bread pudding and we added a scoop of ice cream. It is fine plain, but why not go all out.

My wife makes the desserts.I decided to take this   for thanksgiving.I made the disclaimer to everyone that I made this and not going to hurt my feelings if you don't like it.The pan was scrapped clean.The only thing I would do differently is add more strawberries n cover with foil for entire cook time.I used frozen berries cuz no fresh were available,but I was informed to bring this again or else.It was a nice change from being responsible for frying turkeys or grilln!

I wasn't anticipating everyone loving this, so I made multiple desserts.  It was a huge hit.  People were even asking for more after it was all gone.  I bought bread remnants from a local bakery and some of the bread was a Parmesan  bread.  I decided to  go ahead and use it.  I don't know that anyone noticed, but if anything it added to the flavor.

This is going in my personal recipe book!  My town had just had their annual Strawberry Festival so we had tons of strawberries on hand when I came across this recipe.  I made a few minor changes suggested by other reviewers:  I used about 3/4 of a loaf of fresh French bread, cut it into cubes and heated in 200 degree oven for about 20-30 minutes (just enough to dry out but not brown).  I used 4 eggs instead of 3 and reduced the milk by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup to the cream.  I used a lot of strawberries (didn't measure).  Since my bread was really dry, I left the prepared dish in the frig for about an hour before putting in the oven so the bread could really absorb the liquid.  OMG, it literally never made it out of the cooking dish.  We stood around the stove and ate it straight out of the dish!  I have never been a huge bread pudding fan but I think I can honestly say that this is my new favorite dessert of all time.

I made some alterations  and it was over the top good!  (It may have been amazing without my alterations. Lol!)  I didn't have strawberry preserves so I used strawberry syrup (like for pancakes).  I dried my baguette by putting it in the oven to dry, but not brown, after tearing it into small pieces.  I used more chopped strawberries, probably close to three cups, and less granulated sugar (my strawberries were really sweet).   I added the sugar directly to the chopped strawberries.   I used heavy cream and nowhere near as much milk because the sugar on the strawberries made a lot of juice (why discard all of that strawberry goodness?).
I also added a tablespoon of good brandy to the strawberries.   The pudding was pretty liquid-y.   I beat a block of cream cheese with some powdered sugar, about an 8th teaspoon of almond extract, and about a half teaspoon vanilla, and put it on top of the pudding in teaspoon sized dollops.  I baked it about the same amount of time as specified.  This was over the top amazing!!  I've eaten bread puddings before, but this was by far the best ever!  It was really moist without any dry bread (or any strong egg taste which I dislike).  It was sooooo delicious!  Thank you for submitting the recipe!

Used old white bread that was going to go bad.  Used lowfat cream cheese instead of light cream.  More strawberries.  Brown sugar sprinkled on top before cooking.  Everyone loved it.

This is a good bread pudding. I doubled the recipe but only used 5 eggs and one cup of sugar. I used country French bread. This bread pudding was mildly sweet with the reduction of sugar. I enjoyed it. My mother thought it was "marvelous." Others in the family liked it, too, but I had made a better than anything cake the same day, so it was hard to compete with that. :-) It took about 45 minutes to bake.

One day I made a lot of strawberry jam sandwiches for my daughter's birthday party, and there were a lot of leftover. The next day I hosted a dinner party and I made this Strawberry Bread Pudding for dessert and everybody loved it. I served it with vanilla ice cream. 
I did not use the strawberry jam because I used the jam sandwiches, and I reduced sugar to 1/4 cup. The sweetness is perfect. If you follow the exact recipe it will be super sweet.

I am quite sure I must have done something horribly wrong, when it came out of the oven it was beautifully raised and fluffy, about 3 minutes into cooling and it flattened to about less than and inch thick.  It tastes amazing.  Is the flattening/deflating normal?

Very easy and delicious! I just used 2 cups of milk instead of the cream. I did not use any strawberry preserve, just fresh sliced strawberries. However, once in the pan, I mixed it up and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then I sprinkled it with some cinnamon and nutmeg.

I have no idea what went wrong with this recipe. It smelled great, looked good, until i tasted it! It was horrible, not very sweet and it was leaky.
