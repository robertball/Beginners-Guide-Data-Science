This were really good! However, I think the recipe needs to state that the cott. cheese and egg need to be at room temp, otherwise the coldness of being in the frig might kill your yeast. I added a handful of shredded sharp cheddar to mine and it was a wonderful addition. Also, let my bread machine do the kneading. I put the flour mixture in first, and then added the yeast mixture to the machine after it had cooled. Thanks for a great, tasty dinner roll recipe!

These rolls were so good, so soft and tasty. I didn't use mashed potatoes flakes, I just boiled a chopped potato and mashed it. I will keep this recipe to use again.

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with all of the warm (NOT BOILING!) water and sugar for ten minutes, then added the melted butter (that I used instead of oil), cottage cheese, eggs and all the dry ingredients. I did need more flour than the recipe stated to get it to form into a ball and jump on the bread hook. I didn't measure the extra flour, I just added what was needed. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or more, I had to keep adding flour because the dough wanted to stick to the bottom of the mixer bowl! I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll?), covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. I didn't use sesame seeds. I did get 12 large rolls. 400* for 15 minutes was absolutely perfect. HUGE dinner rolls that were lightly sweet, PERFECT roll consistancy and just....we'll.....YUMMY. I'm rating this five stars even with the needed extra flour because the end result was so good. Really great bakery quality rolls.  NOTE: The dough for this is quite sticky. Don't let that bother you when you make this. It turned out a great product and we all just thought this recipe was great. Also, watch these in the oven, they do have quick minute or two where they could burn. I almost had that happen but I caught it just in time.

This is a great recipe for rolls. Next time I will try adding some other cheeses to add to the flavor. My Dad will love them. Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper.

I love this recipe! I had been looking for a good sub sandwich recipe and so when I found this one I changed the roll shape to long sub sandwich style loafs. It cooks the same and comes out soft just like a roll! Makes 4-5 subs

The rolls are beautiful, but kind of bland. I also prefer a softer, flakier roll than what they produced, but they were still delicious served with my honey butter.

Very simple recipe. I doubled this recipe and got 44 crescent shaped cheese rolls out of it. Here's how. After they rise I took about a pound or 1-1/2 lb. ball of dough, rolled it like a pizza in a circle, sprinkled a lot of grated cheese on top and then cut them in wedges. 8 wedges for a larger roll maybe for like sandwiches and 10 for smaller rolls.   You start from the outside (the widest part of the wedge) and roll inward but make sure you put the roll on the cookie sheet so the narrow point is down. Then place them on a sprayed cookie sheet, let rise til doubled and then brush with beaten egg and a bit of water mixed in and then top each one with a bit more grated cheese. I like my rolls lighter in color so I took off a few minutes of cooking time but as long as the bottoms are not raw when you take them out of the oven, you should be good to go. These were marvelous!  Super soft, and you could taste the cottage cheese which I thought was so um um good.  A definite keeper.  Oh, one more thing, I use high gluten flour for all my breads that I get from Smart and Final but bread flour works well too. Happy baking (and eating too)!

I accidentally added both eggs to the dough mixture (oops!) but they still turned out fluffy. I didn't have sesame seeds so I opted to top with poppy seeds. The dough is sticky, but I used all the flour called for and it was fine. The cottage cheese sort of disappears into the bread. They aren't overly flavourful, so I may add some cheddar next time and a little seasoning. This would be great with a flavoured butter though. EDIT: These taste way better the second day; perfect for sandwiches! Very much like a bakery bread.

They were so moist and very fun to make. I made 24 for just me and one other person and we left them out on the counter, in a bread basket and they never got hard.

Used a little more cottage cheese the they called for. Turned out awesome. Had three people request the recipe. :) will make again. Oh and they stayed soft for a couple days. One of the most important things!

Not sure if i did something wrong, but I got nowhere near the number of rolls this recipe was supposed to make.  They would have been practically tiny!  The ones I did get done were ok, definitely use an insulated pan as the ones I did on a regular pan got burnt on the bottom before they were done.

We loved these, they were moist and Yummy.  They were very easy to make, and yes the dough is sticky, but I prefer a sticky dough, as some doughs can be stiff, and result in a very dry bread-roll-bun.
