FABULOUS!  I wanted a more savory than sweet recipe as a side dish with the meal, and this really fit the bill. The ingredients sound strange together, but the end result is so good, even the kids gobbled it up.  I used sugar free lime jello, "lite" miracle whip, and full fat cream cheese.  Because I love the taste, I also added about a tablespoon or so of fresh dill and everyone loved it.  Has a fresh cool flavor on a very hot day. Definitely will make again, I am going to try with lower fat cream cheese to make it a little more healthy.

Fresh, light flavor. Not a sweet salad as most gelatins can be. Great side dish with pasta. Will make again.

This is hard to rate. My mom (87 years old) loved it while my daughter-in-law (who typically eats everything) couldn't get it out of her mouth fast enough. I would say that the flavor is that of the lime jello. I made it exactly as written and I have a feeling that there is a meal where it will fit in. I might take it to a pot luck just for fun. People try anything there. Other than that I think it costs more than it is worth.

I have made this about 5 times this holiday season already.  It's a huge success each time.  And I'll tell you, it is perfect as is for my crowd of friends and family do to some having allergies to various foods, such as pineapple (all forms -fresh, canned, juice...).  Thank you for this delicious option!
