A lovely, dense coffee style cake, it was easy to make and tasted delicious. A semi-sweet chocolate glaze with more almonds sprinkled on top tarts it up sufficiently to meet the approval of even the most discriminating koffee klatch.

When the recipe said dry - it meant dry! I made it for an office event and everyone agreed it was awful. It was so dry it was like eating biscotti. It is a must to have coffee to dip the cake in because it's so dry.

I went ahead and made this cake without reading the reviews, but I did pay special attention to the DO NOT overmix instructions and (after I had read the reviews) the baking time, which I shortened by 10 minutes.  Substitutions I made to the recipe were the following:  Duck eggs instead of chicken eggs, and 2/3 cup of mayonnaise, rather than sour cream.  When finished, I glazed the underside of the cake with a mixture of confectioner's sugar, orange juice and vanilla.  I then plated and turned the cake over, and drizzled on a chocolate ganache.    Finished with some orange slices, that I slightly poached in Southern Comfort, I think this cake is going to be a HUGE success.

This cake is always a great addition to our meals.  It's also very easy to make some variations for your tastes - I make is a 2 layer cake and add more orange zest between the layers.

Nice cake, very good. Didn't have all the ingredients, so I played it by ear... I put more orange in, and the result is very satisfying.

This was a huge hit with my family and my followers.  I used a box cake mix and a few add ins but it was moist and delicious!  You can find my tutorial here:http://kellisretrokitchenarts.wordpress.com/2012/12/20/orange-cake-w-dark-chocolate-ganache/

it's hard to go wrong with chocolate cake, and I added some grated orange zest and a bit of the juice to the batter with amazing results
