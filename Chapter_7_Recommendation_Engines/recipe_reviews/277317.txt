This is not a spicy sausage recipe. Nor is it intended to be--if you look at the ingredients. As written, it's a delicious and flavorful breakfast sausage seasoning that would probably go well with a variety of meats. I personally used a combo of turkey and pork for a good in-between of lean and fatty meat. I do not care for overly spicy things either, so this seasoning was perfect for me. The sausage tasted great as a side to some blueberry pancakes and scrambled eggs--it complimented everything well. If you want a lot of heat, then add your own spice to taste. Real simple to adjust it that way, honestly.

The flavor is  balanced and very tasty! I I added the full amount of this spice mix to a pound of ground meat - as stated in the authorâ€™s notes at the top of the recipe.

This worked perfectly in ground turkey. I added an 1/8 tsp of spicy Cajun seasoning and a tablespoon of water (per the notes at the bottom of the instructions).

I will be using this for making turkey sausage patties in bulk for freezing. Thank you!

It was a bit mild for us. But it was a great spice blend to start with.  I added toasted & crushed anise & fennel seed (2tsp each). It was delicious.
