While I used this more as a base recipe since I didn't have the beans and subbed ground beef for the tofu, we really enjoyed this dish and added sesame seeds on top.

Adorable name! I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't follow it exactly due to lack of ingredients, but great and I can't wait to follow it exactly next time. Sure it's worth 5 stars and a keeper.
