This went over really big with my family and co-workers.  The seasonings in the mayonaise was a great touch that really made the extra difference.  I also added cheddar cheese on the top.  It was outstanding!!

This recipe is very similar to mine.  I put a layer of chopped celery over the lettuce layer and I use chopped green onion instead of a regular onion.  After the mayonnaise layer I put a big layer of grated Parmesion cheese, then I crumble 6 eggs over that and slice 2 tomatoes over the eggs and sprinkle real bacon bits over.  I do not use season salt just 2 cups mayonnaise and 1/8 tsp. garlic powder.  Very good.

I loved the ingredients in this salad and it is rather easy to prepare, especially since you can prepare it the day beforehand. I brought it to a potluck and was asked several times for the recipe!!

This is a "fantastic" salad for any buffet or potluck.  I make it during the summer months and serve it with cold chicken for a easy summertime dinner...leftovers are even better the next day!  So many of my friends have requested this recipe from me.

This salad was fantastic!!!  I used a bag of romaine lettuce and added chopped bell pepper.  I also used green onion for the onion.  I've served it twice and have had at least a half dozen requests for the recipe.  I love that it can mostly be made the night before.  This one is going in my permanent recipe file!

This is a wonderful salad for the holidays- it can be made ahead and it looks beautiful if you make it in a glass trifle dish.  I add fresh cauliflower and broccoli florets in small pieces.

I made quite a bit changes to this. Either way I am asked to make it every year. I chop instead or tear the lettuce. I make 1/2 the dressing and use lite mayo, replace the chesnuts with a can of drained garbanzo beans, use only 1/2 of a vidalia onion, and make a final layer with some shredded cheese on top of the tomatoes before serving. To save time if I can find it in bulk I will use the pre-cooked bacon and heat it in the microwave. The rest of the ingredients I keep exactly the same. The salad also displays really nice in a clear glass pedestal type bowl.

I have been making this for years only I don't use tomatoes but add grated cheddar cheese between the egg and bacon layer.
My recipe also only calls for enough mayo to completely cover the peas - all edges should be sealed with the mayo to keep the inner ingredients fresh.
It always tastes like more!

I found it to have too much mayo.  I had to later mix it all together and added more lettuce.  If I make again I will use 1/2 the mayo

We loved this recipe! (Even the kids!) We used a whole pound of bacon and sprinkled a little shredded cheddar on top.  Can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for posting.

A nice change of pace on the buffet table.  It presented well in a clear pan. I made according to the directions and everyone seemed to enjoy it. This salad has many possibilities for variations and the next time I may try using a bleu cheese type dressing and perhaps a layer of pickled beets.

I love this recipe!  The seasoning added to the dressing makes this really special.  When I make this, people always ask what my secret is that makes it different from the normal layered salad.

I used previous suggestions and added a layer of cheese and some peas.  The waterchestnuts give it the perfect crunch!  This recipe makes A LOT...

I followed the recipe except I used a bag of salad mix (iceberg & carrots mostly) in place of the lettuce.  Used only 1/2 small onion (green onions would be good too).  Don't leave the water chestnuts out - they make that extra "crunch" you need.  Took this one to a ladies gathering and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe - it was soooo easy.  This goes into my permanent file.  Thanks for sharing!

The only thing I did differently was to replace the waterchestnuts with small chunks of cucumber and used a red onion...this was amazing! I made it for a potluck and there was nothing left over to take home! It was my first attempt at a layered salad and this is totally a keeper recipe!

I made this to go along with Easter dinner.  I was excellent!  I did swap out the water chesnuts for celery, but otherwise I made it as written.  I was unsure about the mayo layer, but once served the flavors came together very well.  I would make this again!

Delicious!  I receive so many great compliments on this salad - it was easy to make, could be done ahead of time and serves up beautifully!  The only critique I have is that it is a bit messy to serve in a 9x13 pan - next time I plan to make it in a trifle or similar bowl.

I love layered salads! I dont use the egg because it tends to get a little ripe smelling. I use a dry ranch packet in the mayo and I dont use peas. I use black olives and cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and red onion. But everyone has their own variations...they are all great!

This salad is sooooo good! I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted celery for water chestnuts,green onions for tomatoes, and omitted the eggs. Excellent salad.

Great recipe! The only adjustments I made was Miracle Whip for Mayo.  My family loved it!!  Next time I think I'll add a tad bit more bacon.

Great recipe. I omitted the water chestnuts because I don't like them. A big hit at the Christmas family gathering. It was eaten up completely.

This recipe was a great hit at our church dinner! I added 2 stalks of chopped celery to the lettuce. I also used greens onions and grated carrots for color. I mixed sour cream with Miracle Whip for a creamier dressing,  adding Cavender’s Greek Seasoning for color. I used a very deep dessert dish for presentation effect. Next time I’m going to add chopped apples and pecans.
The only issue I had, was the elderly didn’t dig down deep enough to get the whole salad. So they ate most of the good toppings!

This takes a little prep work but worth it. I made some changes because I can't eat dairy. I used Kite Hill's cream cheese alternative (One tub) and So Delicious Vanilla Yogurt (6 tbsp) with the spices. I also don't care for peas or bacon so I used Lima Beans and Turkey Sausage in their place. And lastly, I love onions so I added more than the recipe called for. Very creamy and crispy salad that goes a long way - as a side or lunch salad. ??

This was a lovely salad. The only two things I changed: I omitted the seasoning salt and I whisked in a quarter cup of milk for each cup of mayonnaise when making the dressing (from my husband’s recipe).

Added onion powder and dill weed to the dressing. A couple of splashes of rice vinegar added extra flavor. Yummy salad.

I didn’t use tomatoes because no one in the house likes them but it made for a delicious dinner. I also added shredded cheddar and mixed instead of layering.

Such a good recipe. I to am not a fan of water chestnuts' flavor, but I think it needs  the crunch, so I use jicama instead.

This was an awesome salad!  I halved it in order to serve 4 people, and with huge helpings had by all, it was the perfect amount.  I thought the can I was opening was water chestnuts, but as it turned out it was artichoke hearts.  So, I threw those in as a layer instead.  Very, very tasty.  I also took some advice from previous reviews and cut back on the mayo ( about 2/3 c for half the recipe - used reduced fat version) and threw some low fat shredded cheese on top.  Not a lot...just a sprinkle.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Would be a great potluck contribution.

It looked nice. Skip the water chestnuts, didn't like the flavor.  It had too many peas.  I would try it again with celery in place of water chestnuts and more bacon.  I also skipped the tomatoes to prevent sogginess.

This turned out really well.  Cold, crisp, creamy, and delicious! I substituted 1/2 cup of mayo for sour cream, and instead of water chestnuts I added radish and cucumber. I also used canned Le Sueur peas instead of frozen, and sprinkled a little crumbled blue cheese on each serving.

I've been making this salad for years, my family always requests this salad for holidays. However, my layers are slightly different. I layer lettuce, thinly sliced red onion, thawed peas, fresh sliced mushrooms. Cover with 8 oz reduced fat sour cream mixed with  1/4 cup sugar (I use splenda), cover that with 3/4 cup mayo. Sprinkle the top with shredded parmesan cheese & crumbled bacon. Delish!  The beauty of this recipe is that you can substitute vegetables according you personal preference.  I've never tried this salad with the egg & tomatoes but that does sound yummy too!

Hubby and I both loved this. Didn't follow the recipe exactly - didn't have water chestnuts- added cubed leftover pork roast for extra protein. Hubby prefers miracle Whip to mayo, so I added garlic and onion powder and paprika. Hubby actually considered seconds, which never happens with salad.

This is one of my all time favorite salads, and one I actually do not mind making! The only thing i do differently is I thaw the peas, and I typically make it the morning of, not the night prior.

Made this salad for thanksgiving  dinner. The only thing we didn't have much left overs.
