The kidney bean, corn, lentil and fresh parsley combination in this recipe is exquisite. Unfortunately the amount of "dressing" in this recipe overrides that flavour. Next time, I will half the amount of vinegar/oil and omit the sugar completely. Thank you Kelly for your recipe.

iI liked the recipe as is.  but I had been given some Organic Pure Maple Syrup for a present.. used that instead of the raw sugar..very nice. and I added some fresh chopped garlic.
I am the only to taste so far, but I like it a lot :)  UPDATE..  the next day all of the flavors had melded and wow.. YUMMY

There was no much dressing. I thought it tasted alright. I wouldn't want to make it for myself again  though. My 11 month old baby, on the other hand, loved this!

We used a little less than a full bunch of Italian parsley and it was delicious! I couldn't stop eating it and even the kids liked it.
