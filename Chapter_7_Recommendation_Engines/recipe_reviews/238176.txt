Somehow all the tomato flavor got completely lost in the cloves, I think.

Too much of clove flavor.   More of a clove soup than tomatoe.  ??Guess I should of thought it through before attempting this recipe.  Or read the reviews.

A friend said to me "never refuse fresh tomatoes when offered.  There is often a glut during peak growing season.  Take them, freeze (as they are) in an icecream container with a handful of basil...winter soup!"  This recipe made the most of this..I drained off some surplus fluid gathered during freezing, then cooked up.  Used a vege stock cube instead of chicken broth (son is vegetarian) cut down on the cloves and it was very tasty.

Excellent! I used tomato and basil that we had frozen from the garden.  I followed the recipe except I substituted chicken broth for the skim milk (personal preference, I didn't want cream soup).  Will add this to our winter soup rotation!  Very easy and the best tomato soup I have found.

First taste says WoW! Great recipe.  But, I will agree with the comments about going lightly on the cloves.  Some may be necessary to give this soup its character but I will be adding back in the other ingredients to dilute the clove already added. Finally, got a great way to use up all the frozen tomatoes from last year before I start on my next crop. And I know what I'll be doing with a lot of the 2019 crop.

The first time I made this, the only things I did different was leave out the salt and sugar, and use celery seed instead of celery salt. It definitely doesn't need salt or sugar. I think it would be too salty with the salt added. It came out great. I served it with grilled cheese sandwiches for dipping. Everyone loved it. The second time, I used turkey broth instead of chicken.  Really didn't make a difference. I also used dried basil because I was out of fresh. Works great. Since then I have upped the spices a little bit, which gives it more flavor. Definitely a keeper.

This was a little more work than some of the other tomato soup recipes I've tried, but definitely worth it! By far the family favorite now for using our fresh tomatoes every summer. I cut back on the salt and the cloves, and used chicken broth in place of the milk just because we prefer a less creamy soup.

I followed this recipe loosely, using what I had on hand (only 5 medium size tomatoes, not 7 cups; didn't have any celery salt, so added some fresh celery; and had some cream on hand that needed to be used up, so used that instead of the milk). What I ended up with was delicious!  We served this with grilled cheese sandwiches, and my tummy was happy! Looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and easy. I only had 4 medium Roma tomatoes and used some leftover tomato sauce to make about 7 cups. I adjusted the spices as we like them. It will be a soup staple for my family.

Everyone loves this soup! The only changes I made was to add some sweet peppers to the vegetables and I used whipping cream instead of the skim milk ( no cornstarch & butter needed). Perfect for a winterâ€™s day.

made this recipe as stated, but I might add a little less cloves. Also served as stated, and put parmegian cheese on top .  I kept leftovers in fridge for a few days, and I might do that again before serving,  as the flavors melded together better by then.  Also, I then served it with bacon bits and croutons.  Liked it that way better.  would def. make it again

Tomato soup is a favorite of mine, and this was the first time I ever made it from fresh tomatoes--worth it!  I barely put a pinch of cloves in it (I'm not a fan), otherwise I made the recipe as stated.  The flavor was perfect!  I think canned tomato soup is now history for me.

I agree, cloves overpowering tomato flavor. I will try it again with half or quarter of the recipe amount.

I made the recipe with the stated ingredients, except that I was out of fresh basil and celery salt, so I used dried basil and chopped fresh celery.  It was a hit with me and one family member, but the other disliked it.   That was a shame because she normally loves tomato soup... I think that all the flavors incorporated well and I will try it again in the future.  I did not puree it though.  I prefer chunky soup.

Came out really well but don't add more ground clove than the recipe states ..it is a very strong flavour..or omit the clove if you don't like them !! Lovely with a dollop of mascarpone cheese too.

This recipe is delicious!  My wife & I added seasoned croutons and the result was excellent.  Our neighbor had given us fresh tomatoes from the garden and that put it over the top.

This was delicious; even my husband liked it, which is saying a lot because he normally doesn't like soup.  I only added 1/8th tsp of ground cloves as this can so easily overpower the flavour.  Next time, I'm going to add a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce and substitute thyme for the dill, which isn't a favourite, and omit the basil altogether.

Yum!  This was soooo good!  Added 3 cups of chicken stock (instead of 2C) and eliminated the butter step.  I did use the skim milk and cornstarch.  Used my immersion blender and blended everything right in the pot!  Perfect way to use that bounty of garden tomatoes.   Will be making more to freeze to enjoy this Winter.  Thanks for sharing!

This soup was delicious.  You may want to go light on the ground cloves, as it is pretty potent.  I also used an immersion blender to blend right in the pan.  I will definitely make again!!!

This soup is delicious!  I followed the recipe as directed, which resulted in a wonderful, creamy tomato soup with a hint of texture and superb flavour.  A great way to use up ripe garden tomatoes!
