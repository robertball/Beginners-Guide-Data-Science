This recipe was an instant hit over the holidays. I made both the plain peanut butter fudge and the half chocolate and half peanut butter and both came out great!

So easy and so good. This will be my standard PB fudge recipe from now on. I can see where it would burn easily, next time I'm using a better saucepan. It got better each day-especially the 3rd. Then it was gone so I cant tell you how it was after that. Darn good is my guess though. Thanks !  :)

I followed the directions to the "T". It was WAY too sweet and grainy. It took forever to set and was gooey. Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.   : (

I found this as mediocre at best. Not enough peanut butter taste and it was too 'fluffy'.

First off I am an amateur fudge maker, so I was looking for a starter recipe. This was a good beginner recipe, but I will note that the first step does take at least 30 minutes, so it's no 5-minute fudge! Also, mine turned out grainy, but that could be because my friends were over and wanted to try it, so I put it in the fridge to let it set. Next time, I will just leave it out to set and maybe that will change the texture.

This is the first time I have ever attempted to make peanut butter fudge, and it turned out fabulous!!! My husband and sons loved it and said I should make it more often. 
The only things I did differently were: added 1/2 cup peanut butter and lined pan with wax paper. It was super easy to remove the pieces from the wax paper.
