This cake is absolutely wonderful. 
I added 1 tsp. of lemon extract and instead of 1 cup oil, I used half cup applesause and half cup oil.
When cake was finished cooking, I dusted the top with icing sugar
I make this quite regularly now and always get asked for the recipe.  Thankyou Darlene

Excellent!  Moist and scrumptious.  I added about 1 tsp. of sugar at the bottom of my bundt pan before added the mixture.  When the cake was done, poked holes through it and drizzled it with juice of one lemon and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.  Topped with zest of 1 lemon.  To die for!

I can't say enough about this cake.  It was easy, delicious and a crowd pleaser.  My parents happened to drop in after I made this and they took half of it home with them.  I used fat free sour cream and might try substituting some applesauce for some oil the next time I make this.

This is a wonderful recipe - and very forgiving too.  I realized after I had begun to prepare it that I only had 1/4 c. oil, so I used that, and added 2-3 T butter, melted, and 1/2 c water.  I wanted to use up the sour cream I had, so it was probably between 1-1 1/4 c sour cream.  I only used 2 T poppy seeds for our personal tastes, and lastly I added 1 tsp each of vanilla, almond, and lemon extracts to the batter - my favorite combination.  I sprayed my bundt pan thoroughly with cooking spray and sugared it per the instructions, and the cake released from the pan beautifully.  It was done for me at 50 min.  I glazed it with about 1 1/2 c powdered sugar, 2 T butter, melted, a tsp each of vanilla, almond, and lemon extracts (again), and a little water to get the consistency I wanted.  All these little accidents added up to a fabulous cake, so I will probably do it exactly the same way again!  But I do not think you could do anything to keep this cake from being scrumptious.  My daughter declared it "deeeee-licious".  Thanks for a great recipe.  Good way to use up that cake mix I had on hand.

YUM!!!  I made this recipe at a family gathering and everyone devoured it.  It is moist and delicious.  I only altered it by adding 2t of almod extract, and next time I will increase that to 3t.  I served it in a pool of the microwaveable lemon curd also on this webiste, with some fresh, sliced strawberries on the side.  An impressive-looking and delicious recipe.

Where are 6 stars when you need them? This cake is delicious - moist and wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe to a T and couldn't be more pleased. I did a lemon glaze and drizzled it over the warm cake. Really impressed the family - thanks for this keeper!

DE-LISH!!  My mom and I couldnt stop eatin this, it is soooo good.  I have made it for many occasions and it is always a favorite.  A definite keeper!!  Rich, buttery, mmmmmmm.....  PS I wouldn't put sugar in the bundt pan first as it caused our cake to stick, i recommend spray oil and lots of flour!!

This was one of the best cakes that I ever tasted.  I followed the directions but used splenda instead of sugar and egg beaters instead of eggs.  I also added 1 tsp of pure lemon extract and got rave reviews.  Thanks Darlene!

I just adore this cake and it has to be among my favorite lemon cakes I have ever baked.  The perfect light and moist taste is just ideal to serve at the end of a summer meal and I love the contrast of the poppy seeds.  I used a Pilsbury Lemon cake mix and also added 1 teaspoon of lemon extract.   Followed the recipe and the rest of the ingredients exactly.  Thank you for sharing, I know I will be making this cake often!

This cake has been my family's favorite for years and is expected to appear at every family get-together. I always use only 1/2 to 3/4 cup of oil and it is delicious and moist. I never bother to glaze it. We love the bit of crispyness the sugar gives the outside of the cake.

The cake was very easy and tasted wonderful.  I would suggest just a light dusting of powdered sugar as a topping.  The only reason it didn't get five stars was due to the nutritional analysis.  Save for a special treat!

This is my mom's "top secret" recipe and it's simply fabulous. We like it drizzled with a glaze of milk+powdered sugar and it's especially festive with colored sprinkles. I love this cake and used to hope it'd break in the bundt pan so we could have one around the house

Very good, I used white cake mix, half applesauce for the oil. It turned out well and the sugar did not even carmelize.

If you are looking for an extremely moist, dense too die for cake, this is it.  I make mine with a lemon Duncan Hines cake mix (I tried Betty Crocker, but the end result seems a tad drier)and add one teaspoon of lemon extract.  Very flavourful!  Another variation is to use a Duncan Hines chocolate cake mix. When I do the chocolate version, I crush up SKOR bits into a sugary powder and use this instead of the sugar on the inside of the pan.  Very good :-)  Next time I make it with the skor bits though, I will combine the crushed skor with some sugar.

If you are looking for a INCREDIBLE Lemon-Poppy Bundt, you must try this variation: I used 2- 6oz containers yoplait Lemon yogurt and only about 1/4 C. Sour Cream.(I am not sure that using that little of sour cream really made a difference, it could be omitted all together if you dont have any). You can also reduce the sugar a bit since the yogurt is so sweet. I also used the vanilla glaze recipe from this site but substituted lemon juice instead of the vanilla extract. The cake was Super moist and just the perfect amount of lemon. I took it to a party and I got compliments and recipe requests from just about everyone!

This was the most delicious cake I have ever had.  Seriously, my daughter made it one afternoon and we ate it all.  This nevers happens.  It was moist with a crunchy outside.  We used a vanilla glaze over it which added a special crunch and flavor.   It doesn't look like much but it is wonderful  Delicious! Margie and McKenzie

I was on the hunt for a delicious lemon poppy seed cake recipe, and was thrilled to find this. What a fantastic cake -- and extremely moist! I happened to make a few modifications which included using a lemon cake mix instead of a yellow mix, and then added gated lemon peel and the juice of 1 lemon to the batter. 

It baked up beautifully and tasted divine! Thanks for sharing...  I'll be making this again soon!

This was a really good & easy cake to make.  I actually made 1/2 and put it in a loaf pan (I just put the package of cake mix on my food scale and dumped out 1/2 the weight into a bowl).  I added 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract (and halved the other ingredients).  It's not really designed to be a loaf cake as it was extremely moist and fluffy and when slicing sometimes the slices would fall and break in half (usually loaf cakes are firmer).  Still, it was very good.

This recipe is really, really good!  I made this particular recipe because I already had the ingredients.  I made it with 3 eggs since that's all I had and beat it longer in the stand mixer.  It came out light and moist.  It did fall a little in the middle, but that really didn't matter since it rose to the top of pan.  I did sprinkle the pan with a tablespoon of sugar (after spraying with Pam for baking) and it didn't burn.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll make this again and maybe try it with half applesauce since it's pretty heavy on the oil.

Yummy but RICH!
I put a lemon/milk/sugar glaze on it aswell, but still very VERY rich. That might have been the cake mix I was using, but anyways, overall it was a four star.

This was an awesome cake.  I did add the almond extract as another review suggested.  I also didn't have sour cream and substituted fat-free plain yogurt, and it was still a wonderful cake.  My picky kids, and husband who doesn't like cake, ate the entire cake in one day.

This is delicious! I also add almond extract and/or lemon zest and juice. This also works very well with a gluten free cake mix.

Yum!  Husband said it was the best bundt cake I've made.  We liked it because it wasn't overly sweet.

I thought this was very good, I added about  half a teaspoon of almond extract and drizzled an almond icing over the top.  Very yummy!

I used a lemon cake mix and added 1 tsp lemon extract and lightly drizzled a glaze made from fresh lemon juice and powdered sugar. I made this cake for my aunt and uncle who are in their late 80's and they absolutely loved it.

This poppy seed cake is beyond good !!!!!!!!!!!!! I have made this about 100 times and follow recipe exactly as written the only thing I changed was I use a lemon glaze made with the juice of 1 lemon and 1 cup of confectioners sugar (I usually use concentrated lemon 3-4 tablespoons) This cake is ALWAYS a huge hit with family and friends. Thank You for sharing !!!!!!!!! I swear you will love---love this cake.

Absolutely delicious, inexpensive and easy to make.  I used a 2-piece tube pan, greased and sugared it as directed, and the cake came out perfectly.  Should note that the cake should cool, in the pan, for 10 minutes and then be removed - run a knife around it (inside and outside) as needed. It slid out intact, which can be challenging with a tube pan.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Going to take it to work so I don't eat the whole thing!  It's dangerous!

Turned out great.  Good dessert for those who don't like chocolate. Cake has 4 eggs and rises.  If you open the oven door during baking, the cake will fall.

Delicious! I made for a small cafe in our senior community. 
Used suggestions  of lemon cake mix,  added citrus extract, and baked in greased pan sprinkled with sugar.  Topped with a thin glaze using almond extract.  Next time I probable will cut down on the oil using other suggestions.

Delicious and gone in a day.   I only added a thin vanilla glaze when it had cooled for a few minutes.  I might try to put a little extra sugar into the bundt pan, as it did stick slightly.  I also might use less poppy seeds.  I personally thought it was lemony enough and would not add curd or extract.
