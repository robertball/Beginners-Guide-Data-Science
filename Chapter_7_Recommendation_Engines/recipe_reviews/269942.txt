I made it and just added a sprinkle of granulated garlic to the recipe. Also, I used lean sausage from a local source. If you use any Hillshire brands products, you had better have a good cardiologist because the fat levels are off the charts.

This was an easy but delicious dinner. Next time I’m going to try using chicken breast to make it a bit healthier.

This dish had a beautiful balance of  flavors.
My changes were; Used our own pork sausage and homegrown rubbed sage. I used a full pound of sausage. Next time I make it I will cut the rigatoni by a couple of ounces. The picture doesn't show the porportion of meat and squash to pasta. It was pasta heavy I thought.

I didn’t have fresh sage so used 1/2 tsp dried sage. I added 1 small leek white part only cut into 1/2 inch rounds. Combined with squash and sausage. My husband said it was  better than  good and wanted it again.

Loved this recipe.  Good change of vegetables with the squash, but any vegetable would be good.  Little high in calories but tastes good.

Excellent way to serve Kielbasa for dinner. Lots of butter and parmesan cheese which goes crispy on some of the butternut squash. Delicious and easy dinner to serve in bowls.
