We really liked this!  I followed the recipe very closely.  My only deviation was to cut the hot pepper sauce to 1/4 teaspoon, and this was enough heat for us.  Though the roux took a few minutes more than the recommended time to develop its color, it provided richness and complexity that was very satisfying.

Delicious! Omitted okra. Cooked the roux for 30 minutes for a rich broth. Hot sauce on table for individual use but not in cooking. Husband is Cajun and he loved it. Will certainly make again.

I have to agree, not a big fan of boiling sausage but when put together with all the other ingredients, it was fab!

It was very easy to make.  Well written instructions.  I omitted the red pepper only because I didn't have one, and added a can of tomato, okra, and corn (drained).  It all worked out nicely.

The roux was flavorless. I kept adding more Cajun spice. But it never really flavored it very well. I tasted the seasoning and it tasted like it was right but I don't think I will make this recipe again.

Just got done eating a bowl of this gumbo I followed the recipe except I used an andulle sausage made locally at Costanzas sausage didn’t add any salt and used a jalapeño instead of the pepper sauce i also browned up the sausage in a fry pan to give it some color before boiling it with the rest of the ingredients. it was wonderful very tasty will definitely make this dish again.

Great gumbo. Easy to make and tasted great. You can adjust the amount of spice with less Cajun sea song and hot sauce. I used what was recommended and it had a good amount of kick. But I like spicy. I didn’t substitute or leave out any of the ingredients and pretty much followed the recipe to a T.

GREAT gumbo!  this one will be added to the regular staples menu for sure.  
some fairly insignificant mods that just felt right: 
-used EV olive oil/quinoa flour for rue. 
-doubled the garlic (can never have too much garlic!)
-used nitrate free spicy beef andouille sausage & sauteed for a few minutes ahead of time in evoo/garlic on med-high heat to get a good sear (b/c i prefer anything in the hot dog family burned at least a little).  
-used a little more broth than called for for added soupage
-added a couple diced jalapeños.
-used chili garlic cholula for the pepper sauce
-seasoned up the cooked rice with s/p, cholula, splash of worcestershire just before serving

I added half a pound of chicken cut into cubes (2 pieces fit on a spoon). I put it in with the veggies but left out the okra. I doubled the cajun seasoning. Plan on making it again on our next snow day.

We loved this!  I added a can of diced tomatoes and another teaspoon of Cajun seasoning.  Loved how easy it was compared to the half day versions.  Thank you!

First time I've ever made a roux or gumbo and it turned out amazing!  Will definitely make this again and again, especially when shrimp is in season! Pairs up well with corn muffins.

Substituted andouille sausage for smoked for a bit of a kick and served with brown rice.  Otherwise followed recipe as written.  Wonderfu!  Be ready for the kick.  It's a keeper.

This was pretty good!  I'm not a huge gumbo fan, but made it for my husband.  He loved it and I really liked it.  He had another recipe to use, but I couldn't find it so went to my trusted all recipes website.  We had a can of stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce to use for his recipe.  I decided to had half of each just to give this gumbo more flavor and color.  In my opinion it might have been a bit bland without the added tomato.  Otherwise, great recipe and I'll make it again some day :).

We love spicey! This was perfect for a cold snowy day.  Only thing I changed is that I added 2 more cups of water (we like to have some broth with our gumbo) and added a chopped tomato.

I make this every couple of months I love it so much!! I'm not a stickler to the measurements but I follow the recipe pretty well. It's always a hit in my home. And the neighbors really enjoy the leftovers.

I thought this was exceptionally good and lots of flavor. I used 1 T of the seasoning instead of 2 t. My roux turned dark red in a matter of minutes, almost burned. Did not take 8 mins to turn color. Good thing I was watching it closely. All in all, quick, easy to make and finished in no time at all.

Loved this!  The house smelled great!  I only had shrimp on hand so I doubled the amount of shrimp to make up for the absence of sausage.  I substituted the cayenne for 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce and used chicken bullion with water instead of chicken broth.  Vegetables were cooked a little to long for my liking, but overall great dish!

Definitely making it again. It was so good. I made it as directed except I put in only half the spices called for. I knew I'd have some guests here that wouldn't like that much spice. The hot sauce was put on the table for those who wanted it hotter.

Delicious!!! Used Andouille sausage and substituted yellow pepper for the green and couple shakes of Cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce as we didn't have any :) Will definitely make again.

Fantastic recipe! I omitted the green pepper and instead added fresh corn - cut off 2 ears and 2 fresh tomatoes, peeled with seeds removed. Also I used all natural smoked chicken sausage with Italian seasoning. It is spicy enough without the pepper sauce; it's good to let each person add as they need. Will definitely make again.
