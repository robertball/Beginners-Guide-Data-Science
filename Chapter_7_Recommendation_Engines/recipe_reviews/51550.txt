I made this for a potluck and doubled the ingredients. I was only able to get a taste of it because it was all gone by the time I got to the dish. Everyone loved it but I thought it could have used a little more salt. Make sure you write down the oven temp because it doesn't appear when you print the recipe.

This dish was pretty easy to make and tasted great, but I wish it was a little creamer inside and a little crustier on top- also the baking temperature for un frozen preparation is totally unclear.  I did it on 350.

Good flavor, but nothing extraordinary.  Very easy to make.

I will be trying to find a better mac & cheese recipe than this one.  It turned out very dry and gritty and my kids didn't really want to eat it.

My family just loved this recipe--and it was soo easy to prepare. Had to pass it on to my Dad--he's retired and plays Mr. Mom, but won't even try a new recipe if it has too many steps!!!! The only thing that I did differently was added 3 kinds of cheeses to it!!!! YUM!!!!

First time I made it, it was a little dry.  Second time I used just a cup and a half of the macaroni.  Made for a much creamier dish.  Everyone loved it.

Everytime I make, I get requests for this recipe.  I do add 1 can of chicken (or tuna), only add 1 egg and 1/4 cup half-n-half.  I top with crumbled bacon and bread crumbs and sometimes a little more cheese.  Can be made ahead and holds up well at pot lucks.

My family loves this recipe. Although I love a more grown-up mac n cheese with a more savory flavor (onions,mmm...) my kids won't eat that. This is a recipe we can all agree on. It's cheesey, creamy, not too sharp, and just very  tasty. This is my stnadard recipe now.

This recipe was awesome. The only thing I did different was prepare it and instead of baking it I put it in a slow cooker, took it to work and by lunch, it was done and so very good. Everyone loved it. I will definetly make this one again. Update: I've made this at least 20 times-I double the sauce mixture for a truly creamy sauce and still put it in the crockpot to stay warm during parties.

This was REALLY good.  I've been looking for a scratch mac & cheese recipe for a long time and my search is over.  This one is it.  I added some finely chopped onion and some extra salt for flavor, but other than that, it was perfect.  Thanks!!!

Very good recipe, but I love the standard mac & cheese. I usually add a little more cheese.

This was more a casserole than what I think of as standard Mac and cheese.

My family loved this recipe.  My husband never takes leftovers to work for lunch, but he made sure I packed some of this for him.
