These cookies are very good. They taste like a mix between a chewy brownie and a peanut butter cookie. If you don't like really sweet cookies, leave out the frosting. They are just as good without it!

Yummy! I followed the recipe but because I love peanut butter the teaspoons used for the center peanut butter mixture were closer to tablespoons.  These are as filling and rich as brownies and one is enough to satisfy even the most avid chocolate sweet treat eater. I will make these again.
