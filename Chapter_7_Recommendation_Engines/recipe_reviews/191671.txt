This one is a real crowd pleaser! My personal touch: add fresh basil to the pesto then throw it into the oven with jalapeno cheese on top to really spice things up. Caution: this one is really hot!

I used pine nuts instead of almonds.  This has great taste, and is easy to make.  I put some pesto into mushroom caps, and baked until heated through.  It made great appetizers!

Loved the idea! Had to change it - only had a cup of cilantro so i used a little less oil and nuts. Used a mix of almonds, cashews and sunflower seeds instead of just almonds. Turned out delicious!!!

Simply amazing! I keep a batch in the fridge, and use it to top salmon or chicken breasts before baking in the oven. Really excellent flavor, and super easy too. Thanks, Amber!

Used pine nuts because we did not have almonds. Turned out great. I never thought to make pesto with cilantro - what a wonderful idea.

We had a lot of cilantro to use from the garden. This was so easy to make - I followed the recipe exactly, just adding olive oil as it blended until the consistency looked good. I love the flavor and the kick of the pepper flakes. We served over fish. A delicious variation from regular pesto.

I found this way to oily, and wondered if it was just me, so looked at another cilantro pesto recipe and that recipe called for 3 cups of cilantro for half cup of olive oil rather than the 2 cups listed here.  Now I'm wondering what I can do to fix it as I don't have anymore cilantro on hand. Any suggestions?

i make this recipe exactly the way it says and i love it!!! I've tried recipes using basil and really didnt care for them.  this one is so simple and alot cheaper to make, it has just the right amount of spice.  I even use it as a spread for my home made fish and chicken fillet sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe

Omitted the red pepper flakes (for the family) and didn't have enough cilantro in the garden yet, so used half fresh basil. Delicious! Loved the toasted almonds in it, and I used lime juice too for a variation.  This pesto would be good on fish and chicken too. Thanks for sharing!
