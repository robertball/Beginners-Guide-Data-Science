I made 1/2 a recipe to try this out and it fit fine in a square pan. I didn't use granny smith apples, I believe they were Gala apples, but I don't think that matters. The difference between this apple crisp and others I have eaten is the slight change in the topping. It is not really crispy except for the "old fashioned oats" I used. And, the topping tastes like an oatmeal cookie, but has the consistency of "apple butter," but it is really sweet! The marshmallows dissolved while cooking, but I am guessing were added for extra sweetness? I thought it was a little sweet, which could definitely be cut back. But, texture aside I did like that the topping tasted slightly like a baked oatmeal cookie which was a little different.

I took this to a girl's night and everyone had seconds!  I kept hoping that people would stop eating it so I could take home leftovers.  Next time, I'll make one just for me!  I made this very close to the original recipe, except in half.  And I used 5 smallish Fuji apples instead of 4 large Granny Smiths, since that's what I had on hand.  The proportion was perfect! So good, but it is very sweet.  If you pair it with anything, make sure it's not sweet - probably not something you want to add ice cream to.  It would go wonderfully with a cappuccino!

I followed the recipe faithfully, but it was way too sweet for me.  I was rather impressed with how syrupy it was and the melted marshmallows were yummy, but won't be trying it again.

This is just way too sweet for my family -- even my tweens, who love sweets, didn't finish their portion. We love apple crisp but the marshmallows in this variation almost made our teeth hurt.

The marshmallows made it too sweet.  A traditional apple crisp is much more to our liking!

This was very good- everyone loved it BUT it was very, very sweet. I think when I make this again, I will use less brown sugar. The marshmellows gave it a GREAT topping- was fund and different and o so YUMMY. I wouldn't omitt them because it sets it a part from other dishes.

Loved it! I was a bit short on butter so I just made it with what I had and it still came out great! Definitely will make this again!

ItÂ´s deliciously crunchy and the combination of the soft apples and gummy mallows make every bite just perfect. Fast, tasty, easy to make.

This was delicious!!! I was hesitant about the use of marshmellows in it, but as one previous person said, it turns into apple butter. This is going into our recipe box for sure!

This is a great recipe. My family loves it. I only made a few changes. I double the topping, but when I do, I only use 3/4 cup of brown sugar. Otherwise it gets to be a little too sweet with the marshmallows. I also add a little nutmeg and ginger to the apples.

Yum, yum, yum!  Awesome!  I made exactly as written and it was perfect.  You really can't taste the marshmallows, but I like seeing them all browned and delicious on this crisp.  Will make often!

I used about half the sugar. We thought it came out very well. I'd add nuts though, apple crisps always taste best with some toasted nuts on top. I docked it a star bc the sugar might really knock your socks off otherwise, and I did use Granny Smiths. Any sour apples should work. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good.  I did cut back the brown sugar just a bit and it wasn't too sweet as some said.  I liked the marshmallows in it!

So many reviews said "too sweet", so I swapped the white sugar for brown in the apples. I cut the brown sugar in the topping by half, but used the instructed measure of marshmallows. The family wants to see the dish OFTEN! It is sure a great way to use up marshmallows that have lost some of their fluffiness! Little variation that didn't hurt anything, old fashioned oats vs. quick cooking oats still works fine, as does using a tablespoon of tapioca in with the apples instead of flour.

The only problem with this recipe is, once it is done, you can't stop eating it.  Then you wish you would've made a double batch

I halved the recipe in an 8x8 square pan.  My kiddos (4 and 2) loved it and it even got a thumbs up from the husband.
