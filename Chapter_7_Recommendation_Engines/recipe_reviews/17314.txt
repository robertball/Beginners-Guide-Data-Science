What a yummy, quick, filling dinner!  I used one packet of spicy Ramen flavor along w/ one packet of chicken, omitted the onion, & used mixed veggies instead of just peas.  MMMM!

This one is a keeper!!  I'll always have the ingredients for a hash brown casserole to make at the last minute.  Now I have 2 recipes.  I used mixed veggies as I had them on hand and followed the rest of the recipe.  I think it had good flavor.  I cooked the ramen noodles for 2 minutes instead of 3 so when combined with the vegetable sauce mixture they didn't get too soggy as stated in other reviews.  With a salad and some rolls, I'd serve it to company.  Would give it 10 stars if I could.

This recipe was quick & tasty! I wasn't crazy about eating the ramen noodles, so I recommend substituting spaghetti or another type of pasta to accompany the rest of the ingredients. Great flavor.

I used sausage that came in links and just sliced them, if I ever made again, I would used ground sausage so there was more in every portion.  Noodles became soggy the longer the dish sat, but it didn't last very long in my house anyway. Added some Tabasco to spice it up a little.

Made a few changes based on personal taste and other reviews: 
Instaed of peas, I diced a large carrot and cooked it in the boiling water before adding the noodles.  Then, instead of actually cooking the noodles, I turned off the burner and let the noodles soak for a couple minutes before adding to the meat/sauce mixture.  Also, I sauted a couple garlic cloves with the sausage and onions.  It's an okay "what can I throw together from the pantry" type dish, but still needs a little spicing up, imo.

I found this recipe using an ingredient search in an attempt to use up food out of the pantry - was not too satisfied. 
I followed the suggestions of others and only  cooked the noodles for 2 min. added some corn for sweetness, tobasco and only used one packet of seasoning. Still was a little bland for my taste. DH said never make again because Ramen is meant to be only Ramen not with any additions. Had to share that - but at least he was honest.

Used all 3 of the ramen packets, sugar snap peas and a salsa flavored sour cream.  Plenty of flavor and a great mix - however the 3rd ramen packet added too much salt for me.  My mistake.  Otherwise, this is a very nice combination of flavors to add to our menu. It's always refreshing to find recipes that are quick and simple that require ingredients often found on hand!!!  Thanks for recipe!!

Although my teen boys liked this, I must comment from an adult point of view. The smoked flavor permeated the dish; the noodles are soggy by nature; not enough contrasting flavors. I will not make it again.

My family loved this meal.  It's a great way to use inexpesive raman noodles.  I make it even easier and use store bought turkey meatballs cut into quarters.  Tastes great and takes even less time to make!

This recipe was a dinner saver.  We started to make turkey sausage and sauerkraut - which we do pretty often - and didn't realize until I had already sauted the onions and cooked the sausage that I didn't have any sauerkraut.  So, I typed in turkey sausage and onion on this website and this recipe was the first one to come up.  We really enjoyed it - I'll probably make it again.  Thanks!

I felt this recipe was pretty simple to make, which was nice, and a great way to use up some leftover turkey sausage I had in the fridge. I made it as written and I thought that it was a little bland, as some others have written. I'd probably add some soy sauce and maybe some mushrooms to it, if I were to make it again.

It's a good recipe, just needs a little tweaking.

This was an inexpensive dish to make and my family loved it.  I did make one change. Instead of adding peas I added shredded green cabbage and cooked it with the noodles.  It is simple and quick dish to make when you are in a pinch.

I made 8-servings and followed the receipt but found it had too many noodles for my taste and I didn't add the peas (I have a pea hater). Next time I would reduce noodles by one package.

I made a variation of this recipe last night, without the ramen noodle flavoring..I used a box of twisted elbows pasta, and instead of sour cream, I used Greek yogurt, because I had some to use up. it was very good! this is something I will make again.

This was just OK.  Noodles were way to soft but I will try this again and use a firmer pasta like penne and add some spices to make up for the ramen spices because I did like the rest of it.  Just can't handle mushy noodles.

We loved this one!  My grocery store didn't have turkey sausage, so I used bulk (mild) Italian sausage.  I'd do that next time as well; the flavors were great together.  Throw together a salad and some crusty bread and this is a quick, easy family-pleasing meal.

Recipe was so easy to follow and quick to make. My family really enjoyed this one - even though my son wasn't crazy about the peas!! He ate them anyway. I didn't have to make any changes to this recipe - it was tasty as is. Nice addition to our menu.
