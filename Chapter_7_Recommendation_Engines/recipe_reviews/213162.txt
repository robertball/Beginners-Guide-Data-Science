My wife has made this for me as long as I've known her and I've always loved it. One important change (I think) is that she doesn't use instant rice; instead partially cook up a good whole grain rice medley ahead of time and add to recipe. She also does way more salsa....and any cheese you like will do the job nicely, we usually go for the medium cheddar already in the fridge.

Served this for company-everyone loved it.  Just a couple changes.  I used 2 packages of partially cooked Yellow Rice w/seasonings, added a can of diced tomatoes & a diced onion.  Because it is my MO, I cooked it in a large crock pot for 8 hours turned to low after one hour. I will make it again.

This was very good!  I gave this recipe a 4 because I made some changes.  Instead of using cream of chicken, I used a can of cheddar cheese soup.  I also added some chili powder, crushed red pepper, and jalapenos.  I did not measure out the salsa, I just used enough to cover each chicken breast.  Before serving, I added extra cheese while it was still hot.  Will definitely make again!!

very good, I think next time I will add a cup of frozen corn in addition to (or instead of) the yellow bell pepper and also probably some onion for a tad more flavor.

I left out the beans, substituted sweet onion for the pepper, and used 2 cans of lime clilantro rotel tomatoes instead of salsa. I also seasoned the rice cilantro soup mixture with garlic salt and pepper and seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, chili powder, cayenne and black pepper. It was very good, I will be making this again.

I used instant brown rice instead of white and it turned out terrible!  The rice on top was cooked, but on the bottom it was still crunchy.  This had a great flavor, but if I try brown rice again I will increase the liquid or decrease the amount of rice called for.

Overwhelmed with compliments, sooo delicious. Great mixture of spices and not too spicy for the weak :) Hubby loved it, daughter loved it, and I loved it. My chicken turned out so moist, I double checked it to make sure it was cooked all the way. Yummy. I would suggest this to anyone who is craving a mexican style chicken, which is also low maintence.

This was a great recipe. Definitely add the extra cheese and salsa. I used instant whole wheat rice and it worked out fine, so that is also an option if you want to go whole grain but don't want to pre-cook the rice.

This was great! I cooked it a bit longer because my chicken pieces were bigger, and I added taco seasoning on top of the chicken before I cooked it for a bit more flavor, and I probably used a bit more salsa- I just eyeballed it. Corn would be a nice addition.

My boyfriend loved it and has asked me to make it again already. Didn't have any beans on hand, but we didn't miss them. Used brown rice instead of white. I had doubled the recipe so we'd have leftovers, but only used 1 can of soup to cut down on the sodium.

Good recipe. I doubled the black beans and used cooked brown rice (3 cups).  It took a lot longer to cook than suggested, but it was good and I will make again when in a pinch.  Not something I would  crave, but easy and everyone seemed to like it.

I used leftover cooked rice (about 3 cups). Seasoned that with salt, garlic powder and chili powder. I used a roasted red pepper (from a jar). I also seasoned the chicken a bit before topping with salsa. Added cayenne pepper for some heat. Got rave reviews. Thanks for posting.

First of all this came out of the oven just looking beautiful! My boyfriend thought I had turned into a professional cook! Also, it tasted delicious; I used a sweet habanero salsa which made for a great flavor. The only thing is the rice was a little bland to me. Maybe throwing some spices onto that before adding the chicken on top would help. Otherwise, it was delicious and lasted a long time for leftovers!

this was alright can't say I would make it again.  I think I would try out some other new recipe if looking for something to do with my chicken next time.

It was pretty good. The kids loved it. My only problem was that the chicken was pretty bland. I think that next time, I'll cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and bake then so the chicken can absorb more flavor. Marinating the chicken ahead of time might help, but then that would ruin the speediness of the recipe. All in all, I really enjoyed it..everything but the chicken had a great flavor that was perfect for my two small kids. Thanks for a quick meal idea!

It is exactly what you expect. A homemade not-so-homemade casserole. Husband and kids loved it. Used what ever I had on hand. Cream mushroom soup. No beans. Pre cooked brown rice. Added some butter and seasoning to the rice. Easy dinner.

I used instant brown rice and just mixed everything in the baking dish before topping with chicken and salsa instead of mixing the soup, etc. separately...also added almost a can of corn and the whole bunch of cilantro.  Topped each serving with a teaspoon of sour cream...was delicious!

Made this for supper tonight.   Added 1/2 cup frozen corn, sprinkle  fajita spice from epicure on the chicken, and topped with kraft jalepeno cheddar.  Also didn't have cream of chicken soup, so i used cream of mushroom and added chicken stock to the water.  Really enjoyed it.

Turned out great! Instead of the regular black beans I used a can of Bush's Black Bean Fiesta which added a bit more flavor. I also seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper. Definitely a keeper.

Awesome! I doubled this recipe for my family. I did not have 2 cans of beans so I used one can of corn and 1 can of beans. I also seasoned the chicken with fajita seasoning and served with warm flour tortillas. A keeper and my family loved it!

Yummy! I also used a little more cheese and salsa then called.  For the salsa I used Harry n david pepper n onion relish with zifandel. I am a vegetarian so instead of using cream of chicken soup, I used Cambells condensed fiesta nacho cheese and vegetarian chicken cutlets.

Loved this recipe! My family likes spicy. The only change I made was to add 1 tablespoon taco mix to the soup mix. I will make this again for sure!

Simple, easy and everybody(even kids) liked it.  Used instant brown rice because that is what I had but partially cooked rice would work too.  Served with green salad and tortilla chips.

This was amazing!!  I added a small can of green chilies and layered them over the beans and rice.  Then I sprinkled that with garlic powder.  To the soup and water mix I added about 1/4 c. of sour cream.  I didn't have the type of cheese it called for so I used sharp cheddar.  Oh, and I too increased the amount of Salsa.  Great dish!

I've made this several times for my family. THEY LOVE IT!!  It's good on it's own, but when you add a few more things to the recipe, it's even more yummy!!!  When I make this dish, I almost double this recipe and use more chicken and rice, so we can enjoy this dish again for leftovers!! :)  I probably use at least three pounds of chicken breasts and cut them in half length wise, so you have long thick chicken strips.  I use 2 1/2 cups instant white rice.  I use cream of chicken soup, but have used cream of mushroom soup and you seriously can't tell the difference.  I add a cup and a half water to the soup mixture.  Along with a can of Rotel, which gives it a little heat. If you like A LOT of heat, add jalopenos!  When preparing my chicken, I cover them in salt, pepper, garlic powder, MeCormicks Cilantro leaves and chili powder. I also add a cup and a half of whole kernal corn and chopped red bell pepper.  I prefer using black beans, but in a pinch pinto beans work just fine. I also add enough salsa to top each piece of chicken with a good amount. Since I've added bigger pieces of chicken, you might need to cook it just a little bit longer, maybe fifteen minutes, check for doneness, ( I take it out of the oven and cut the thickest piece of chicken to check for tenderness ) add more time if needed.  If not, top with your shredded cheese, pop it back in the oven for ten more minutes...then it's DINNER TIME!!!  And....since you've made extra....it's DINNER TIME AGAIN TOMORROW! :)

I didn't like this recipe as it's written. I found it very soggy and bland.
