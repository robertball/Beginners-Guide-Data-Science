A quick and easy recipe I make often when my husband is out of town because it doesn't have enough meat for him (since it doesn't have any!) It is a great dish to make during the week when you only have 20 minutes.

This is a good recipe. I made mine into a pasta salad and ate it cold, plus I added chicken to it as well for some protein. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it seems there was something missing from the basic recipe. Overall it's great though. And those who don't have the fresh seasonings on hand, you don't use the same amount as you would fresh. You use 1/3 of the amount dried you use for fresh. So you would need 1/6 cup of basil, which is 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons of basil and 2 teaspoons of dried oregano. I hope this help everyone who doesn't have access to the fresh herbs.

A little bizarre to eat pasta with uncooked tomatoes. I didn't have time time to buy fresh basil or oregano and used dried ones instead, which didn't turn out good. The pasta was aggressive as a result. Also, it was too vinegar-y for my taste!

Loved this.  Definitely need to use garden fresh tomatoes - not the ones you get in the grocery store - to make this dish a success.  Very simple and light meal for summer.

Great recipe. I have tons of basil and have been looking for ways to use it. I did add chopped onion and garlic to it and put it over spaghetti. I will make this again.
