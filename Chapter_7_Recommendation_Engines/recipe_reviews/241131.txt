Made it for a party, but used fresh corn instead. 3 ears of corn, and 6 fresh jalapeno, sauteed with butter in a pan, then added other ingredients and threw into a crock pot. My guests went crazy for it, had to use 2 packages of cream cheese to get the flavors right, omitting sour cream.

I love this. I made it twice in one week. I did make some changes to it the second time. I added a can of rotel tomatoes. I omitted the mayo and doubled the cream cheese   Added 1/2 a chopped onion and 1 tablespoon of southwest seasoning.  This recipe is a great base that you can tweak to your liking.

I made this for Christmas and it was just okay. I can't put my finger on it, but I just didn't like it, and I followed directions exactly as written. It didn't have much taste. I will not be making it again.

Delicious just how recipe is written but better if sits overnight. With the name jalape√±o corn dip, I expected it to be pretty spicy. I think, the spiciness is just right.
