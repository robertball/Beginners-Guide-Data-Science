I made a few changes and the flavor was great.  I added the juice from 1/2 a lemon to the batter and mixed it in my Kitchenaid mixer and I had no problems getting everything to blend.  I also ran the beater between batches to keep it well blended.  I added a package of Lemonade flavored koolaid to the powdered sugar.  It gave the cookies a bit of tartness that reminded me of the Lemon Coolers that I believe Sunshine used to make.  Next time, I may cook them longer than recommended at a lower heat so they will get crunchy without browning and I'll dip them back into the powdered sugar/lemonade mixture after baking.

These are great! A friend gave me this same recipe but called them lemon drops. If you like soft chewy cookies then you will love these. I baked them on an airbake cookie sheet for about 14 minutes since baking on airbake cookie sheets make them lighter and less crusty than regular ones. My mother and I are going to make these for her next open house. (I shared a picture of how mine turned out.)

These cookies turn out light and lemony.  They are very refreshing.  Getting the cake mix completely blended into the whipped topping is a challenge, but well worth it!  Everyone who tried them, liked them.

Hmm... where do I begin?  To start on a positive note, they were very pretty cookies.  But the dough was entirely too sticky.  I baked mine for 10 minutes, kept them in for 12, still didn't look done so I added an additional 3 minutes.  Yes, they were soft chewy cookies, but I found them to be gooey and overly sweet.  My second batch I kept in until they were nearly a golden brown.  They were better because they were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  But it wasn't good enough for me to finish baking the rest of dough.  Update:  I stored them in a ziploc bag and the next day the texture was better and the taste mellowed.  IF I ever made these again I'd bake them a day ahead.

First, I read the reviews before I tried this recipe. I tried it the way it was written the first time, then changed a few things and tried again and they turned out wonderful. They were very pretty cookies that got a lot of attention at a bake sale. I wanted them a little tart so I added 1 T. of Real Lemon to the batter. I also measured 2 cups of Cool Whip for the recipe and put the batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour before measuring out a scant 1 t. of dough for each cookie. I baked them for 12 min. and they were perfect when they cooled. My great-nephew asked me to please make some more! Thanks for the recipe.

Yum, yes they were sticky but oh so worth it. Then I started Playing with the recipe reduced suger cake mix, suger free wipped topping. and I made a suger free powdered suger out of splenda and cornstarch. I didn't send my mother-in-laws blood suger through the roof and she had a cookie she could call her own.
Sorry for making all the changes to your recipe. I make it just the way you say for the rest of the family,but big momma get's a little more TLC. Thanks for a cookie that fills the not just the "same ol cookie" void.

The practical beauty of these light cookies is that you can keep the few ingredients on hand in the pantry/freezer at all times for quick refreshments for those unexpected occasions.  Yes, the batter is sticky but I used a very easy technique to overcome that.  I mixed in the KA and used the two iced teaspoon method to drop dollops in a shallow bowl of powdered sugar.  Use one of the spoons to dust with sugar, then it's very easy to roll into a ball for baking.

These are amazing cookies. I brought them to a party and they were gone in no time. The dough is very very very sticky, but it's worth working with to get these cookies.

I've made this every christmas for at least 5 years and I love it, it as close as I can get to the ones they used to sell at the store... just be really sure they don't brown before you take them out of the oven, when they are softer they taste better :)

These are good, but werent what I was hoping for. I wanted to make the lemon coolers like the nabisco ones my dad loved. While he loved these, they were not them. These are really soft and the baking time is off by around 4 mins. I will make them again but Im sad they arent what I was expecting. I used real whipping cream in stead of the frozen stuff

I do not understand the 4 1/2 star rating for this recipe.  The texture of this cookie was very off - very chewy, but not a good kind of chewy.  Flavor is nothign to write home about.  But, the cookies are easy to make, I'll give it that.

I've been making these for years. I've used different flavors of cake mix, also. I like strawberry. If you like soft, chewy cookies, these are great.

I made this the first time with lemon supreme cake mix & added 1 tsp lemon juice concentrate.  Cooked for EXACTLY 10 minutes.  Was VERY impressed with how they looked --- absolutely perfect.  As soon as they cooled, tried them but was not impressed with the flavor.  However, the next day they were fabulous!  Next time will also add a bit of lemon zest.  These kept very well for several days before my family wiped them out.  The recipe makes a TON of cookies.  I've also made with Chocolate Fudge cake mix and added white chocolate chips --- very very good!  Red velvet cake mix with white chocolate chips, and strawberry cake mix with couple of spoonfuls of strawberry ice cream topping.  This is a super simple recipe and yields a huge number of cookies.  The stored well in a sealed plastic container and they look just beautiful on a tray.

I make these every Christmas and have done so for years!  You can also change the flavor by using different flavors of cake mix: chocolate, strawberry, cherry, orange (especially good!), pineapple, etc.  The dough is a little difficult to handle at times (I only scoop a little more than a teaspoon at a time) but dipping them in the confectioner's sugar and rolling them helps with the stickiness.  I am always asked for the recipe and have made them so often that I have memorized it!

I made these for my small group and everyone loved them, even the people who didn't really like cookies. Everyone asked for the recipe. I followed the recipe but added 1 T of lemon zest. I am going to try strawberry cake mix and add dried strawberries.

These cookies were so simple and easy to make and they turned out awesome. My only suggestions are that two cups of sugar is way to much, I didn't even use up one cup so don't waste the second cup. Also, I stuck my dough in the freezer for a few minutes prior to dropping and rolling and they were so much easier to handle.

Couldn't get these to work out at all --I ended up substituting 1/3 cup oil for the whipped cream, which tasted great.

These are great lemon cookies.  I make them in the spring when a heavy cookie is not what I want.  The batter does get sticky but they come out great.  Light and refreshing cookie.

I'm giving these three stars because the ease of this recipe was very nice, but I did not like them at all, but that may not be the recipes fault, just my taste buds! They were way too sweet for me, and the baking time was way off in my opinion. At 12 min. they were still gooey, so I baked for more like 15 min. I will not be making these again. Sorry, but thanks for the chance to give them a try!

Even though this sounded easy... this was a terrible cookie recipe. I would not make this recipe again. Sometimes "too easy" is not worth it! Most cookies I have ever made from a box cake are not worth it..start from scratch!
