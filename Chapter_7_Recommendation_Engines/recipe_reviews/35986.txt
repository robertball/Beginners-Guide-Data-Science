You'll need to double the amount of crust to make enough to cover the bottom/sides of the tart pan.  Also, this crust is over-baked at the suggested baking time, I think that 10 minutes is more than enough.  The second baking time, which may be for the custard, is also too long.  After only 15 minutes, the edges of my crust had already been burned.  The finished flavor and look of the crust was that of cardboard.  For a tart, which relies on a good crust, this was a bad recipe.  Pitch the crust, just make some custard and top with fresh fruit!

Yes.  Step #2 in the directions is how to make the custard.

Unfortunately This recipe didn't work for me. The crust didn't cover my baking tray and because of this the filling didn't fit. I left the tart in for the recommended time and it burnt. It only needs 8-12 mins depending on the oven. I wouldnt try this recipe again

I am very disappointed by this recipe. Not only did I have to triple the amount for the crust and double the amount for the filling, but also the crust was rock hard when baked for the recommended time. You could not cut through it with a fork when eating. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone! Do not waste your time!

This is a mainstay at my house. I made mine with gluten free flour and used blueberries instead of kiwi. The crust had a rustic flair with the brown sugar and cinnamon as opposed to the usual white sugar crust and it was a welcomed change. The filling is lighter than a typical custard and is enough for a thin layer as opposed to some tarts that seem more a fruit pie than fruit tart. All-in-all this is a nice change from my usual Italian "crostata" and was a hit for breakfast with the kids. I made this in the evening and refrigerated for the next day. I used some gelatine, melted in lukewarm water, brushed over the tart to keep the fruit from browning. Thank you Lorelei Rusco. We'll be using this method again.
