I tasted the ham before cooking and this recipe really did cut the saltiness.  I will drain the pineapple in a sieve for 30 minutes or so next time as merely draining in the can leaves too much leftover juice making the pineapple hard to work with and adding too much liquid to bottom of roaster.  Otherwise very good and not too sweet at all.  note to self: Cooked 8.5 lb ham at 325 (same temp and time as potatoes) for a little over 2 hours.  Took foil off after first hour and basted occasionally. Easter 2008 - Served with Scalloped Potatoes and Onions and Gulliver's Creamed Corn, both from here.  Also served fresh asparagus, mashed sweet potato and pear, and creamy coleslaw.  Everything worked very well together.

I always say I don't really care for ham and I've never actually made a decent ham in my life.  This recipe changed that!  My kids requested ham for Christmas dinner - and this was fantastic.  The first time I basted it was sorta yucky, the milk had started to curdle, the second time the ham juices had taken over and it was much better.  Just a word to the wise, don't expect the juices to be able to be thickened into any kind of sauce or glaze.

This was by far the best ham I have served!  I did not follow to letter but should have, ie added too much milk did not drain pineapple, BUT results were fantastic.  A keeper.

Wow so delicious! My husband says it is the best ham ever and the next day he fixed it with scrambled eggs and said it was even better the second day. It really does NOT taste salty which has always kept me away from ham. Not this one I loved it!! Very easy to prepare. All of my guests asked for this recipe!! Texas Caviar Seven Layer Salad great sides too!!

I am giving this recipe only 4 stars because I didn't follow it exactly.  I only added 1 c. milk, there was 1/4 in. in bottom of pan.  I used about 1/4 lb. of brown sugar, it wasn't sticking to the ham very well.  And I used 1 can of pineapple, which covered the ham very well.  I also patted on a little more brown sugar on top of the pineapple.  It turned out DELICIOUS!!  The taste was perfect!! Definitely not too salty.  Everybody loved it, especially my friend who is on a low sodium diet!  I will absolutely make this again!

Made this for Christmas 2008. Did as the recipe said as far as preparing and refrigerating overnight. Had a 12 lb. ham & put it in a Reynolds oven bag. Drained off most of the milk prior to baking for approx. 2-1/2 hrs.

This came out pretty good, definitely took away a lot of the saltiness considering I used a pre-cooked smoked ham and they are always really salty. I did use a little too much milk and I had a hard time gettng the brown sugar to stay on. Would like to try it again with a bigger ham, since I just used a small one. Is very nice the next day in a sandwich and I have frozen my leftovers for soup. Didn't amke me love ham, but I do like it a lot better done this way, not so spongy and salty.

I actually combined this with the 'Coke' recipe and got great results.  Instead of the milk, I scored the ham and poured 1 12oz can of Pepsi Throwback (real sugar) all over the ham.  I was prepared to use more, but that was all the 9x13 could safely hold.  From there I followed the recipe by packing on the brown sugar (I used dark for more molasses flavor), and then the crushed pineapple.  I used a 10lb ham, and it could really only hold 2 cans of the pineapple.  I put the foil on so as to help keep the 'coatings', and even secured it with a  few toothpicks.  I let it sit overnight as directed.  The next day I put the foil-covered ham in the oven @350F for 30min, but realized that people weren't going to want to eat in the next 30 min.  So, I reduced the time to 275F and baked it for 4 to 4 1/2 more hours, basting with the juices every 100 min. or so (that's as high as my timer would go!)  I checked it with the meat thermometer to be sure, and it was good to go.  I was worried it might be too sweet, but it was great (and I don't particularly care for ham).  We cut it a little on the thick side, like a ham steak, and you didn't even need a knife.  My husband and dad loved it!

I thought this ham was really good.  It was a quick and easy recipe.  My boyfriend thought it was a bit too sticky and sweet though.

We loved this recipe.  Was amazed how the milk took the excess saltiness out of the ham.  Served for Easter dinner.  One of my guests said it was the best home-cooked ham she'd ever had!  Will definitely make this again!

OMG! Prepared this ham last night and cooked it this morning. To die for! My in-laws raved and raved - and they are a tough crowd!!    Only variation, cooked a full size, nearly 17 lb. ham. The butcher suggested I use a whole ham instead of a spiral ham to keep in the juice. I highly recommend it! I used a Hillshire Farm ham and loved it.     Thanks for the great recipe. Will make again and again!

This was so awesome!  The flavor of this ham is out of this world.  My guests loved it.  The drippings in the pan made an excellent "gravy" to top the ham off with.

Made a delicious ham.  Even my 6 year old who claims to "hate" ham ate this.  Wasn't salty at all, and didn't leave the ham too sweet either.  My only thing is with the cooking time-not likely you're going to heat that ham in an hour.

Makes a great tasting ham!  My husband loves this recipe and raves about it to his friends :)  I have made it several times now and find that I can cut down on the amount of pineapple.  It can be a bit difficult to get the brown sugar and pineapple to stick to the ham (especially if the sides are steep) but I just keep packing it on and then wrap tightly with the aluminum foil.  Definitely will become a family tradition!

I made this easy ham for my family and everyone loved it. My husband said it was one of the best hams he ever tasted. Our Polish au pair, who never likes our food, also loved it and said it was the first good meat she has eaten in the USA!

I had no problem getting most of the brown sugar and pineapple to stick, after I poured the milk over the top. I did drain the pineapple well beforehand.  Hopefully it will taste as well as everybody says! Its in the fridge soaking...
 I believe I overcooked it a little, it was a smaller ham(8.5lb)and also a spiral, it was a little dry. Overall the taste was wonderful and I would definately try this recipe again, only cook it on a lower setting for a shorter amount of time.

Wow! This was so good! And it was so easy and inexpensive!  We made this instead of buying a HoneyBaked Ham for three times as much and I think it was just as good! (Or maybe even better!) I think marinating it overnight definitely makes the difference.  We only needed two cans of the crushed pineapple for the nearly twelve pound ham we got.  Easy, cheap, and tastes awesome! The leftovers are the best! Try them mixed in with scrambled eggs!  Yum!

Definitely less salty than regular ham...very tasty!  I will make it again. ***So, I did make this again and I have to say that I felt that the crushed pineapple was sort of a waste.  It seemed to fall off and therefore I think next time I will use rings and hope that the flavor is still the same for the meat.

We had this for Christmas dinner, and indeed it was less salty than most hams. We found that it took 2 hours to get warmed up though, which really delayed Christmas dinner. If we make it again, we'll let it warm to room temp before putting in the oven. Then, I think it would take about an hour.

We had a bit of trouble getting the brown sugar and pineapple to stick to the ham as one side was very steep. It all worked out fine, though. We enjoyed it for dinner, for several sandwiches, as leftovers, and as ham/bean soup.

Fantastic!! I hate buying cooked ham because it's always way to salty. I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and it came out perfect. My whole family loved it. The milk thing made me nervous but it turned out great!

Very yummy, and although I agree it doesn't taste salty, also agree it's not the most healthy meal!  Lots of fat and sugar, but I have to say the taste was quite good.  My kids quite liked it.

I made it according to recipe, except that I ended up putting it in the slow cooker at the end of the cooking time because I needed to leave the house and didn't want it to overcook in the oven.  

The measurements for the milk, pineapple, and brown sugar really don't matter.  Just cover the bottom of the pan as instructed with the milk, and use enough brown sugar and pineapple to cover the ham.  Drain the pineapple really well, and pack the brown sugar hard with your hands.   I didn't have any trouble getting it to stick.  My 3-year-old even helped.  

Must say, the milk did get a bit weird, sort of curdly after cooked.  I might pour off most of the milk before cooking, as suggested by another reviewer, if I did this one again.

OMG, this was a hit for Christmas day! I only used 2 cans of crushed pineapple as it covered it all very well.  Cooked a bit longer to cook all the way.

This was by far the best ham our family has ever had.  It looked pretty gross, but the looks were deceiving.  We will definitely make this again if we have to bring ham again to a gathering.

Well, the sugar and pineapple just keeps sliding off - wish I had read the helpful reviews beforehand. I haven't cooked it yet - got it wrapped in foil to try and save some of the sugar and pineapple - lots of it floating in the milk.

AMAZING how this works! it had more of a taste like bacon than ham. the milk didn't curdle like others reviewed. but i used 2% milk and not the whole milk. that may have made the difference. this was a southern crowd lover!!

This was a hit!  Like a knuckle head I didn't reall ALL the instructions prior to making it and discovered it needed to be prepared the day before.  So early this morning I carefully covered the ham in milk and added the brown sugar and pineapple.  It sat for 4 to 5 hours in the fridge and then I stuck it in the oven.  I only had 2 cans of pineapple, but I can see where you would want 3.  The sauce it makes while it bakes is yummy.  This was really, really good.  I got a Costco spiral ham that was tastey.  I will not buy the over priced honey baked from now on.

After last year's extemely salty Thanksgiving ham I took a chance with this recipe after doing research with others using cola. The only issue I had was the pineapple would not stick to it even after draining for a while as others suggested (so next time I won't drain and follow as the recipe directed). I used 2 (10 lb) spiral cut hams in an electric oven roaster at 350 for 1 1/2 hours (together) then uncovered and roasted them for an additional 30 minutes BUT I did not trim the fat because I did not want it to dry out. I also drained most of the milk the following day before cooking but still had plenty of liquid in the pan when all was cooked and done. Delicious, moist and NOT salty at all! I will use this recipe again and again. Thank you Christy for sharing!

Made this today...wonderful! It will be my go-to ham recipe from now on. Note to self--I cooked my small (5.5 lb.) bone-in smoked ham at 350 for 18 minutes per pound, according to package instructions and it was perfect.

I am impressed...the ham was delicious!!!  Very sweet and moist.  I did press in a few cloves before cooking which added a little extra flavor.  Highly recommended!!!

I love ham but it always leave me thirsty. This recipe really does reduce the salt. Served to 16 for Easter. Several said it was the best ham they had ever eaten.

This is a great recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing it!  It was a perfect way to top off our Easter dinner.


It certainly doesn't have that overpowering salty taste that a lot of pre-cooked hams have, and I loved the sweetness the pineapple and brown sugar added.  Thanks again!

I baked a ham two days ago with milk as per the recipe.  I was impressed with the results.  I usually eat only a little because it is just too salty for me. Not this one.  Although I may glaze mine differently, I will definitely make them with milk from now on. Thank you!

I can't believe I actually found a way to cut at least 3/4 of the salty taste with a fully cooked bone-in smoked ham.  Milk is the trick!  Merry Christmas; today is 12/25/19!

I usually become a vegetarian around the "hammy" holidays because the salt content kills me but this is recipe actually worked.

I followed the recipe as written and didn't change anything to see how well it worked and and I can honestly say that I'm impressed and will pass this recipe along to anyone having the same problem.   The brown sugar/pineapple glaze tasted great as well!

I asked my family and guests to honestly let me know if the recipe worked at all and everyone agreed that the salt was cut from the taste at such a great amount, everyone had thirds on the ham!

I followed the recipe carefully but when we tasted the ham it seemed to be covered with a pasty substance.  It tasted good, not salty, but the consistency was strange.  The ham was soft, mushy when we chewed it, not at all normal in texture. I assume that this had something to do with the milk that was poured over the ham the night before.  Did it somehow curdle when cooked?  I would not use this recipe again.

This ham was definitely less salty and was a big hit at Easter this year. I am not big on sweet ham, so I cut the brown sugar in half and used Splenda brown sugar. Tasted wonderful and seemed to make everyone happy. Will definitely make again.
