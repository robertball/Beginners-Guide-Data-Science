Thank you!  Thank you!  I was first introduced to this recipe when I was in a homemaking class in 8th grade.  Over the years (almost 50) I lost this recipe so it was great to find this one.  I changed the sugar to 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white and chilled in the freezer for a couple of hours.  They don't have to be exactly round--the shape gives them a little character.  They taste good and look just darling!  Thanks again!

I followed the recipe to the letter and my cookies turned out DELICIOUS. I cut the recipe in half and within a few hours, half of the cookies were gone (my boyfriend and I can't get enough of them). One tip: Don't preheat the oven as step 1, the dough has to chill for 2 hours, what a waste of energy. Will be making these many times over.

These are super tasty! And, beyond adorable. I wanted to make some nut-free, so I pressed a candy corn into the cookies right when they came out of the oven for beaks. Also, for some I pressed a black m&m over the chocolate chip eyes while still warm from the oven. Lots of fun things you can do with these, I can't wait to show everyone how cute they are!

This recipe has been around since the 60s.  My mom made them for us every fall.  Original recipe uses margarine, not butter, and used 1 1/2 squares bittersweet choc. melted with 1/2 tsp soda added to the chocolate.  I've learned to roll the lighter dough around two chocolate logs to form a single oval shaped dough log to chill.  This way, they don't break in two so easily.  My favorite thing about them:  when they bake, they all take on different personalities!!!

Fantastic recipe- clever, adorable and tasty! My friend and I made these for a party and they were an absolute hit! We tried the m&m and chocolate chip idea and it turned out that just baking the m&ms tends to crack them, while just the chocolate chip is rather plain. We ended up using the baked (melted) chocolate chips to 'glue' the m&ms into place.

I have made these two 'falls' now.  My children really like them.  You have to use real butter-it is a butter cookie.  I use swirled chocolate/white chips for the eyes and they look really cool!  These are a hit when given as gifts as well.  Highly recommend.  Cute, tastey, pretty easy-a keeper!  Thanks so much for posting.

these were great! i made these for a Halloween party and they were a hit! i used white chocolate chips for the eyes, and instead of putting them on before they baked i put them on after i pulled them out of the oven so they wouldn't get toasty and dry. i'll definitely make them again!

My Mom has made these for me since I was just a little girl, and we always LOVED them in our family. Somehow, we miss placed my Mom's recipe, so I am so happy to find this one! The only thing we do differently is we use smarties for the eyes, for a nice bit of colour. So yummy and cute!

This recipe works so much better using m&m's for the eyes instead of chocolate chips. Try it! A perfect little cookie for halloween parties.

These are very cute, and they introduced me to a new cookie method - I can now see myself doing swirls and other fun things with refrigerated dough.  The recipe does leave out a few things that most bakers 'know' - like you need a little flour on your work surface when rolling out the dough, the pan needs to be greased, and they need to sit on the pan for a minute before removing.  I used butterscotch chips for the eyes so they would stand out from the chocolate better.

I give this three stars for being cute. I think I did something wrong because I could not get the eyes to be round, no matter how long I chilled the dough or how sharp the knife they just kept getting flattened. They also tasted kind of boring. Probably my fault!

I love this recipe and have been trying to find it for a long time. My daughter also was in a 7th grade Home Ec. class in the 80's and this was the first cookie she ever made. Thanks Lisa for the memories.

delicious, and everyone thinks they are adorable!  once the dough is frozen in rolls it's even yummy to just eat a few slices of the dough.  :)  you can basically use whatever edible candy/chocolate small enough for the eyes and nose :) and they all look so different.  i love them!

Very cute!! I sifted the flour, baking powder and salt together before adding, and I used butterscotch chips for the eyes and an almond for the beak. The dough was very easy to roll, and the cookies tasted great.

Super! My son loved it. I followed the recipe, except for using white chocolate chips for the beaks and sugar balls for the eyes. The dough was easy to work with and they are perfect to look at! The only note to myself for the future would be to make double batches... a single batch of owls doesn't seem nearly enough! Update: I've made double batches twice now. The first time I doubled everything, including the egg and ended up with a very sticky dough that didn't set even after hours in the fridge. The latest time, I doubled all other ingredients, but used only one egg. The consistency was perfect! Had to add about a tablespoon of milk to the cocoa dough, otherwise it was too dry. But otherwise fine.

Easy to make and were a huge hit with my Mah Jongg ladies. The only change I made was using whole cashews for the "beaks". I can't wait to make these with my grandchildren!

The dough was too soft to roll and mold into shape even after it was refrigerated overnight. Tasted great but didn’t look as good. Next time I will try adding more flour.

Wow! These were very tasty and really cute! We didn't have enough time to chill them completely, but they turned out just fine! Since we didn't have chocolate chips, we used butterscotch morsels instead! They were a good contrast against the chocolate!

OMG - these are so cute! When I first saw these, I knew that I had to make them for my husband to take to work. He works for a local university, and their mascot is an owl. I changed the colors a bit to mimic their mascot. They turned out really cute - and they taste good too!

I made 3 batches of these.  One last weekend for practice and two this weekend.  They are really cute and they taste good.  I would like to put  a photo of mine on the site, but it isn't  working for me, for some reason.   I couldn't find anywhere to get help in doing it.  I have added photos in the past with the old format, but this one just doesn't seem to work.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I had trouble blending the cocoa into the dough because the dough was a bit dry.  Still, they came out tasty and cute!

I think this idea is cute!  I changed the eyes into M&Ms and put them on after the cookies were cooked.  I also changed the beak into candy corn.  I am going to make some for a Halloween party!  I love this idea!

Super cute.  I needed them to be nut free so I used smarties for eyes and banana runts for the beak.  I can't wait to show them off.
