My all around favorite cookie of ALL TIME!  

Tips: I make the cookie dough and place it onto waxed paper, make into a log, and put it in the fridge for one hour... then I roll it into tsp size balls by hand (do not flatten), place on a parchment lined cookie sheet and then chill again for a bit.  Then I bake for about 15 minutes... until golden.  I let them cool a little while on the cookie sheet then I transfer them to a rack to cool.

The frosting is EVERYTHING on this cookie!  Pipe the frosting on with a piping bag and a large tip.  I also use 2 TBS. of butter in mine.  Sprinkles are nice too!  Make sure to let the cookies sit overnight after frosted to let them cool... the frosting hardens a bit and helps hold this very fragile cookie together. 

EGG NOG VERSION: add 1/4 tsp. fresh grated nutmeg to the dough and 1/4 tsp if rum flavoring and another 1/4 tsp. of fresh nutmeg to the icing.  YUMS!

I really enjoyed these cookies. To be honest, after I had made my first batch, I tasted one, and instantly began to make a new batch because I knew they'd be gone right away! I suggest that you don't bake them for only 12 minutes, I had to bake mine for at least 15, so that they are a golden brown on the bottom.

This is my family's favorite Christmas cookie! The only thing I do differently is use almond extract instead of vanilla. The taste is extraordinary! I also color the frosting pink and green for Christmas; they look beautiful on cookie trays!

The recipe said to drop by the teaspoon full - I did this and they didn't flatten at all during cooking - so they were fat little balls. They looked better when I flattened the balls. These do melt in your mouth - I guess there is something I don't like about the cornstarch flavor - and these aren't very sweet - definitely need the frosing - I tinted mine pink. They turned out pretty - but just OKAY tasting. I will not make again - as I could take these or leave them. :-(

Love it! So simple to make and yummy! I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great! These cookies do not spread on the cookie sheet so don't worry about placing them too close!

I am a fan of melt in your mouth cookies or butter cookies. I made another version of MIYM cookies and they were wonderful and very easy to make. While the taste was good, the cookies fell apart easily. By the time, I was done transferring the cookies to the cookie sheet, most of them either broke apart or fell on the ground. Because of that issue alone, I was unable to put the butter cream on the cookies so we sprinkled powder sugar on top instead. Otherwise, they won't taste sweet at all. 
While I was not totally disappointed at the taste, I don't think I will be making it again. I like my old one that has fewer ingredients and simpler steps.

We make these every year for Christmas, and I know how to make these even better! For the frosting, mix 3 oz. cream cheese with 1 c. powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, and two drops of food coloring (I usually do green). 

Flatten them with a cup covered with a cloth over it dipped in flour before baking. They shouldn't be golden when you take them out. They still look pretty white, and I let them cool on the cookie sheet before frosting them. Yum yum!

These cookies are the best!  They really do melt-in-your mouth!  My family and friends ask me to make these cookies all the time.  I always have to triple the recipe to have enough for everyone.  I have found that the baking time is more like 14-20 minutes if the batter is cold (I keep it in the fridge while batches are cooking).  Thanks so much Debbie!!!

These cookies are delicious.  The only problem that I had was with the icing.  This combination does not harden.  Add one teaspoon of corn syrup and I am told that will fix the problem.  Cookies are not nearly as good without the icing but they do taste a like pecan sandies.  I tried the cream cheese in the icing and that does add a nice flavor... *** UPDATE I made these cookies again last night and thought that I would roll the dough with flour on my hands and make them look nicer... what I got was a perfectly round cookie with a big dot of icing in the middle... The icing did harden but I left the cream cheese out and like it better with the extra flavor.  The cookies tasted to floury also last night... They are definitely better if you go by the recipe and don't roll them into balls (I put a dent in the middle to hold the icing nice and neat but it works better if you just let them take their own shape!) I would suggest going by the original recipe (or adding pecans which makes them even more wonderful) and letting them cool before you put the icing on and don't make the icing to thin... I also made mine really dark green for Christmas but they look better a little more pastel colored...

I couldnt even get my four year old to eat them and she LOVES any cookie. My sister tried them and was very blunt. EW. disaster. Out of a family of 5 these pleased no one. They dont melt in your mouth, they are crumbly and feel as though you are chewing melting sand. Im sorry to be so blunt. Just embarrassed.

These cookies are great!  They remind me of pecan sandies without the pecans.  I also cooked them for about 20 minutes, and my cookies crumbled when I tried to ice them, so I drizzled the icing over them with a spatula which worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really great without the icing if you want a rich tasting (not so sweet) cookie, or fantastic with the icing too!  I replaced the Vanilla with Almond extract to change it up a bit and it tasted great!  Also, I had to increase the baking time, to 16 minutes which was the perfect time for them.

I absolutely love these cookies. I just finished making them and I would have gave more stars but they are so delicate that I broke a couple just transferring from cookie sheet. But they are very pretty too. I used red color for dough and green for icing and sprinkled with holiday decor. mmmmm!!!!

Most of these cookies fell flat.  The ones that didn't, crumbled massively (even after letting them cool).  There just isn't enough liquid in these to hold them together.

I tried these just following the recipe, and they turned out very salty and they were crumbly right out of the oven (not burnt by the way...).  I am disappointed that I wasted so much butter and other materials.

I get big reviews when I make these.  I sometimes substitute the vanilla extract with mint, strawberry, lemon, orange, and color the frosting to match the flavor.  The result is cute little polka-dot cookies!

These are good cookies and the frosting is awesome, it tastes great and holds its shape well. Just pipe it out of a bag and you won't have any trouble frosting the cookies. My only complaint was that I could really taste the corn starch. I think I'll up the flour to 1 1/4 c. and reduce the corn starch to 1/2 cup next time.

I tried this recipe and it have a heavy buttery taste and they are flaky and tend to crumble before they can "melt in your mouth". This was especially true with the frosting, the cookies tended to crumble when I tried to frost them. This was such a disappointment, the pictures were so cute, oh well!

I was a little scared to try this recipe, due to the mixed reviews, but I tried it anyway.  It is the best melt away cookie recipe ever!  I followed others adviced and flattened the cookies before baking using a flat bottom glass dipped in powder sugar. My cookies were perfect!  I also used margarine instead of real butter and my food processor intead of a mixer.  I will be making this cookies more often! My family and nighbors loved it.  Thanks!

The taste is okay but the cookies turned out flat. I was looking for a recipe that didn't include certain ingredients since i am out of the country and its harder to find some things... not terrible, however, i probably will not be making these again.

These cookies didn't taste BAD but they didn't have a whole lot of flavor, either. You definately can't skip the icing because that's where all the flavor is. The cookies crumbled when I tried to put the icing on top so I kind of dropped a dollop of icing on top while the cookie was still warm so it would kind of melt to the sides. When you ate the cookie it basically fell apart in your mouth, like  a powder. I will not make these again. Had friends over and the recipe was not liked.

I agree with some of the reviews that they tasted like corn starch.  They did melt in your mouth.  Just didn't taste all that great.

These were pretty good. They really do melt in your mouth, but I prefer a more crisp cookie, I guess. As you can see by my photo, I did not bother making them look neat and uniform, but it proves they can still look cute and presentable that way. I liked the way the sweetness of the icing offset the blander, more buttery cookie. A good balance.

I love these cookies!  The recipe is very  versitile.  My favorite thing to substitute almond flavoring for the vanilla.  You can also add it to the frosting.  I have also made them using orange  flavoring and peppermint. (Tint pink for the peppermint and top with crushed candy)  If you are using flavored oils to do this you will need to cut back on the amount you add.   They are very fragile.

The best cookie ever.  I made balls, rolled on sugar, and then   flattened a little with a bottom of a floured glass.  baked the full time.

I just made these, it's Friday.   I'll have to make more before Monday for my boyfriends lunch box...they are awesome.   I flatten them with a glass bottom dipped in sugar.   After frosting them (warm) I dipped the tops in chocolate sprinkles.  Soooo good !!  They don't spread out so I could really get a lot on a tray.  Next time I will make them a little thicker...

Great cookie. At first I thought the dough was too sticky and melty but they came out great! I had them in the oven for 15min for me. The only problem was the icing. It doesn't taste that great but the cookie was delicious. Really melt in your mouth!

I use this recipe every year! I experiment with adding lemon and different berries in the frosting. And it's actually 100% better with cream cheese frosting!

I have used this recipe for years, but I always refrigerate the dough for at least 1 to 2 hours already shaped in balls. If you really want a delicious cookie, don't use milk in the icing, use lemon juice it is a perfect combination to the cornstarch consistancy.

I love how they just melt in your mouth! They are so yummy and the frosting gives it just the right amount of sweetness! :)

These are the most terrible cookies I have ever tried. These have way too much dry ingredients they taste like sweet flour and cornstarch. If you take out some flour add a little more 10x sugar and maybe some heavy cream they could work. I have decided not to bother.

Omg these cookies are the best.  Instead of putting vanilla extract I put almond extract and I add a tad bit more powdered sugar.  And for the frosting I add more milk and drizzle it over the cookies.  DELECTABLY DELICIOUS!!!!

Awesome- I used a little more vanilla than the recipe called for and we thought they were perfect. Very easy to make as well.

Although we make the frosting different, the cookies are the same, and they are exceptional.  They really do melt-in-your-mouth.  Use your favorite frosting (we use the same thing on our sugar cookies).  This is always a must-have cookie on our holiday tray!  And it is simple, too.

I liked the texture of these cookies, but they were a little bland, and they crumbled while I was trying to spread the icing on. I may skip the icing next time and add more sugar to the cookie dough. Not bad.
