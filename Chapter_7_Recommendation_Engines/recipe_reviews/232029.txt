Followed recipe as is and these were perfect. For more of a teriyaki taste I will try marinating the scallops longer. Used low broil mostly and just watched them closely. NO changes necessary. Delicious

This is as good as it gets for a bacon wrapped scallop recipe. The marinade is excellent. I make a homemade teriyaki sauce and marinate the scallops for at least an hour. This recipe is a winner for parties.

I precook the bacon about 1/2 time needed as the scallops will overcook...Excellent otherwise..!

I will definitely make this again! I didn't have time to marinate them, but I will marinate it next time to get an even better flavor. This was the first time I ever made scallops, so I'm happy they turned out well and were liked so much!

I loves callops, I love bacon and the Terriyaki sauce just puts it over the top.  It will be a big hit the next BBQ.

Very nice recipe, made street tacos and used a tarragon aioli mentioned in this site, awesome! As others had mentioned I marinated the scallops  for 30 minutes and baked the bacon ahead for 15 minutes minimizing the chance of over cooking the scallops, came out great with nice and crunchy bacon and perfect teriyaki scallops.

Added a healthy amount of minced garlic and a tsp. of cayenne. 
Marinated them instead of using dipping method.    My guests scarfed them down.  Wish I had made more of them.

My family and I thought these were okay.  I would make them again only would marinate the scallops in the teriyaki/ginger sauce which was, by the way, delicious in its own right.

Incredibly fantastic recipe! I’ve never had a better bacon wrapped scallops. My whole family enjoyed them. I didn’t change a thing except to halve the scallops instead of cutting them into thirds.

This was great! I used Worcester sauce and molasses instead of the teriyaki and brown sugar because I didn't have those things. The pairing was very good. Delicious recipe, and in spite of the fact it's somewhat labor-intensive, the end result was totally worth the trouble.

These were a big hit!  Everything goes better with bacon.  A little sweet, smokey and salty.  Delicious!

The preparation was easy, and with the bacon they came out great. They sear pretty quickly. I  sprinkled some Old Bay on top of them. Let's just say, they were "The other side of heaven." Just make sure that you make the bacon crispy.

That was the best scallops I ever had.  Can't go wrong with bacon.  The teriyaki sauce added to the flavor...
