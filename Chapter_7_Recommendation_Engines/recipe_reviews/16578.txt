This guacamole needs a little more flavor than this recipe provides. Personally, I'd add lots of lime juice, some cilantro, garlic and maybe green onions--anything to give it a little kick!

I made this for a party this past weekend and it was a hit!!!  I used sour cream instead of the mayo and doubled the recipe.  There was none left!!!  My sister took the recipe to make at a game night this week and is going to try it with the mayo.

I loved this, but I didn't have chilli powder so I substituted with sweet chilli sauce, I then added some lemon juice to stop it from discolouring, this dish was so easy to do, I did it in 5 minutes and only used a fork, to give it texture. Thanks April.

This is soooo yummy.  I used chipolte chili pepper, sour cream and fresh lemon juice to prevent browning.  I used a very robust salsa, if you use a mild salsa I can imagine this would taste bland.

Just made this for my daughter to take to the beach.  Tasted great, and so quick.  Added just a little lime juice to keep that green color.

This was quick and easy, my two favorite things.  I gave it 4 stars because I didn't have any chili powder on hand and it was not as zesty as I had hoped, but still tasted pretty good.  I will make it again with the chili powder and maybe a little lemon too.

Good and easy, A tiny bit bland. Next time I will add some finely chopped red onion and garlic.

When I blended the listed ingredients with some lime juice, garlic salt and cayenne pepper added, then some chopped onions, it was one of the best guacs I have made.

This is the way we love our homemade guac. I omit the salt and add a healthy dose of cyenne pepper, hot sauce and Emerils Southwest Essesnce for kick.  Mayo, sour cream or even cottage cheese will do in a pinch.

Pretty good for a guacamole with very few ingredients--very quick, too.  I added some lime juice to slow discoloration and for flavor.  Halved the recipe bc it's just the two of us--glad I did, as we still have half leftover.  I mashed the ingredients together, bc my avocados were pretty firm.  Bf picked them out at the grocery store and I didn't realize before I started making it that they were a bit underripe.  Still worked well, though.  I served on fajitas, and we both liked it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so easy! I use a chunky chipotle salsa with corn in it and the texture of the guacamole is chunkier. My husband doesn't usually like my guacamole, but he cheered when I said I was making this again.

I never made  Guacamole before. I am glad I started with this because it is so good. I can't stop eating it. I added lemon juice and used garlic salt for the salt. I also add more salsa. I had to mash the avacado in the food processer. Thank you for posting . I will make this on a regular basis.

Excellent recipe.  I used Chipotle Chili Powder and added an extra tablespoon of salsa.  I also replaced the mayo with sour cream.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This is excellent. I have been using mayo in my guac for years and always gotten raves. I wish the people that subbed out the mayo for sour cream would at least TRY the mayo version. It's what makes this recipe a five-star.

This recipe was pretty good. Instead of using chili powder I used 1/2 a chopped jalapeño pepper. I like my heat though...others may want to use only 1/4, making sure to remove the seeds and membrane. I added a little extra salsa as well!

I did not care for this recipe. Sorry this maybe why quick--Guacamole has no diary in it. Now it may work as a avacado dip but not close to a true Guacamole. Missing any true amounts of onions, lime juice, or other spices-- black pepper and salt a real no-no

I have always gotten my recipes from this site but had never set up an account until right now, after making and trying this recipe. It's spectacular!!!! I added a Tbs of Salsa, doubled the chili powder and threw in a bit of lemon juice. SO GOOD.

I love this stuff!!  I make it all the time.  My 12-year-old son loves it, too.  He and I can finish off the whole recipe in a very short time.  The best part is how easy it is to make.  Also, you can customize it by trying different types of salsa.  I have been using the Trader Joes's pineapple salsa, and this gives it almost a sweet taste.  Try this recipe.  It's really, really good.  Thanks, April!!

This guacamole was very easy and quick to make. Wasn't sure how the mayonnaise was going to taste in this, but honestly, I couldn't really even taste it. By adding the salsa into the avocados it was kind of a strange color, but still tasted good. We used this to go alongside quesadillas. I will make this recipe again because it was so simple. Thanks for the recipe, April!

Way yummy! I used Kraft free miracle whip instead of mayo for a lower fat recipe. I also used a tad more salsa and garlic salt for salt. Definitely tastes gourmet. My husband tried to tell me to use sour cream instead of miracle whip.  I told him to trust me. He did, and LOVES it!

Fab!  SO EASY!  Had all the ingredients on hand.  I'll never buy guacamole again.  Any Low Carbers reading this: I needed something to dip pork rinds in because I'm not a big fan of them plain but I was desperate for a crunchy snack.  The guac paired with the bacon taste perfectly!

Great recipe.  Although, I have NEVER heard of a tasty guacamole without salt and lime juice!

Love this guacamole. I have given this recipe out to more people than any recipe I have ever made. I have never had anyone try it and not love it! The previous people who reviewed this had to have left something out, it is so tasty!!!

This looks more like soup than guacamole. I will give the recipe it's due for simplicity.

Yum!  I added Red Onion and a bit more spice as well as fresh garlic.  I used sour cream instead of mayo. Great base recipe.

This is a really good recipe as is, but we made some changes that we feel are better.  First of all, we doubled the avocado (or you can halve the other ingredients).   We also added a little fresh-squeezed lime juice (half a lime).   I will try it with sour cream instead mayonnaise since I prefer sour cream and am not a fan of mayonnaise - I have not done that yet, though.   But, if you just follow the recipe as is, it's a good guacamole recipe.   Brava!

Needed more flavor.  I added cilantro, onion, garlic salt, and cumin.  Substituted a dash of chipotle powder instead of plain chili powder. Very good when additional ingredients added.

This is pretty much like my recipe, except I use a touch more mayo, a lot more Chi Chi's Hot Salsa, a few shakes of Garlic Pepper, drops of lemon juice and BACON! Serve warm.
This was taught to my by a sweet Mexican Abuela that made it for a GM cafeteria in Oklahoma.
