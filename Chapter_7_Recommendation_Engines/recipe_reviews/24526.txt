Very easy and delicious! If you are using a raw dough, I recommend pre-baking it for 5 minutes or so. If I hadn't done that I would have ended up with a soggy mess! I diced the veggies fairly small so they wouldn't be too crunchy. Instead of mozzarella I had an Italian 5-cheese blend that I think made a difference. We all enjoyed this, thanks Michelle!

Wow! This was great! I made just a few changes to suit my family's tastes including subbing turkey breakfast sausage for the pork and subbing chopped mushrooms for the red onions. I also used one extra egg and a little more than 8 oz of sausage. A par-baked pizza crust from my grocery store's bakery was perfect. Total baking time for my oven was closer to 20-25 minutes, but my oven is notorious for taking longer than rec'd times. Totally worth making, it was delicious and filling for a Sunday morning breakfast. Thanks so much!

pretty good idea but it was kinda of bland for me.  maybe next time i'll add some basil/parsley to the ricotta for extra flavor.  topped the pizza with some crushed red pepper & parmesean.

Excellent change for a weekend breakfast.  Very filling.  I make my own pizza crusts so I pre baked a small one to use for this and it worked fine.  I was out of sausage so I cooked bacon and crumbled it in the eggs as they cooked and added mushrooms and olives to the toppings.  I don't normally eat eggs but this had enough other things to 'cover' the taste of the eggs and I really enjoyed it.  I do think it would be much better with a hot sausage and will try it that way another weekend. Combine with a Mimosa and it made for a very special morning. :)

Love this recipe and have made it many times. Today I also added 4 ozâ€™s of diced ham as I needed to use it. Ham was added the last couple of minutes to the sausage just long enough to heat it up. Turned out great!

It could use some more flavour. Next time I think I will try pepper jack cheese instead of mozzarella.
