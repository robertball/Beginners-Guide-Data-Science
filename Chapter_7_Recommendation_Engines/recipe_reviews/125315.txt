Wow - I took one look at this and it had my husband's name written all over it!  Anything that has ham AND bacon and I just have to make it for him.  It had a lot of "optional" ingredients so I left out the things that he doesn't like, of course that means most of the veggies like mushrooms and jalepeno pepper but everything else stayed.  I used a toasted steak roll vs. bread because this thing was a little on the large side plus it was getting wrapped in foil and going to work with him.  Overall, it got rave reviews from him.

I doubled this recipe this morning to feed three, my husband and two boys. I used organic eggs, kept the cheese at a half cup and the cheese I used was 2% sharp cheddar (to cut some of the fat) and I used turkey bacon and thinly sliced turkey ham. I used red bell pepper instead of green (just a personal family preferance) and omitted the jalapeno only because I'm feeding small children. I served this on toasted Dave's Killer Bread and instead of mayo, my husband used homemade salsa and reduced fat sour cream as "glue" to hold his om-wich together. I assume they liked them because five minutes later, nothing was left. Thumbs up!

Used ingredients listed in recipe except for mushrooms (sometimes I use, didn't have any on hand).  I made in microwave by melting 1 Tablespoon of butter in a 9" pie plate. I separted the eggs and  beat the egg whites until soft peaks formed, then folded in the yolks and poured into pie plate.  I cooked in the microwave for about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes.  Puffed up beautifully, I then added ingredients on one side of omelet and then folded over.  Served with homemade salsa and sour cream.  Also sprinkled garlic salt on buttered toast.  This is basically the same recipe I use for making filled French omelets. I also use an apple filling or potato/ham filling.  Simple recipe which we always enjoy!

I only had the optional fresh mushrooms and chives to include in this but I’m telling you, I don’t know how this sandwich could be improved with the peppers. This was just decadently delicious – maybe it was the ciabatta bread I used for this sandwich that made it extra special, or maybe it was the unique addition, for me anyway, of the mayonnaise and hot sauce.  I feel somewhat guilty eating this because of its high fat and calorie content, but I don’t indulge in stuff like this often.  My tummy and I are very happy right now.  I suspect we WILL be all day.

Made for the Recipe Group ~ excellent jumping off point for a breakfast sandwich. You can alter this in so many ways.  I did stay close to the true recipe with only the omittion of chives & ham (didn't have any on hand). I used a red bell pepper as I finished my green one at dinner last night.  Next time I will add more jalapeno as I could not taste any heat...and I only used 2 eggs and scaled the rest down by a third as I was the only one eating this, and I served it on a toasted, sprouted grain bagel instead of bread.  I only put half the Omwich on the bagel, the other half will be for breakie tomorrow! :) Great idea demz....thanks for the recipe....

Made for Recipe Group:  09, April '11  Great sandwich - but you had better be hungry!  This is a wonderful, filling sandwich with lots of taste.  I made it with red pepper rather than green and skipped the mushrooms.  Delicious and will make again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Made for Recipe Group. Seriously good stuff! I didn't have any ham, but went ahead and made it anyway. I have made breakfast sandwiches before by just beating everything in with the eggs and scrambling them  together in the pan. Makes sense to let the bottom set but by the time that happens they were browning already before the flip part. I flipped and just let it cook long enough to finish cooking the eggs inside. Never thought to put mayo on the bread, I usually add jelly! Thanks for the recipe.

I haven't tried the recipe yet. I'll give it 3 stars cuz it sounds yummy....except for the "1 cup salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)". I'm hoping that's a typo!!!

Great breakfast sandwich. We did this open faced. I forgot to add the mayo, but I love mayo on my fried egg sandwiches. My omelets always fall apart so it was kind of scrambled veggie eggs.

great breakfast for a hungry crowd or a houseful of teenagers. Many flavours going on with this so it is easy to omit any ingredient that does not sit well with your tastebuds. Thanks

Gotta say, this recipe doesn't really sound to appealing,  but I must say, OH MY GOSH... The Breakfast Omwich is such a good idea, & is totally yummy!!!   This is a must try for sure.

This made my fiancé very happy. It's a great breakfast for using up the bits and pieces left over in the fridge after cooking dinners. We used ham, bacon, green onions, mushrooms, and cheese. I sautéed the mushrooms in a little bit of olive oil with a dash of garlic salt before adding them in, and it was delicious. Highly recommended, and easy to make!

This is right now my favorite breakfast with eggs. I just make my normal omlette with lunch meat, cheese and sometimes olives and add a little salsa inside then put it in buttered toast. Very good.

I forgot to take a picture, but I made this for my pregnant fiancé and I and we loved it. I even goofed and made one big six-egg omelet instead of two smaller ones.
