Delicious.  My family - especially my husband loved this moist yummy cake.  The reason the other user probably found it dry (and what I found a bit confusing at first) is because she probably only added the oil and eggs mentioned above.  You need to add everything the back of the chocolate cake mix says to add plus the additional oil and eggs with the bananas.  Yummy!

Very good, but you do have to make sure that you get enough liquids into the mixture.. follow your cake box instructions.  Mine said that I would need 1/2 cup oil (which I used), 3 eggs (same as this recipe), and 1 1/4 cups water.  So, I mashed 3 bananas, poured them into a measuring cup, and then filled up with water to make the 1 1/4 cups.  Otherwise, I think it would have been a little dry.   
I also poured in about 1 cup of mini choc chips, and then made it into 22 muffins rather than a cake. They took 19 minutes to bake in my oven.  No icing needed.  They were light and airy, but just moist enough.  Delicious!

Wonderful!
I do agree with the others that you need to remember to make the cake mix per the box directions and the add all the others included in the recipe.
This is the most moist cake I have ever had and one of the tastiest. Def. will make again!
I used the banana icing recipe here on AllRecipes and it made it to die for!

After reading the reviews for this recipe I was totally confused about how to proceed even though there are only four ingredients!  My son and I decided to follow the measurements and ingredient list on the box of Betty Crocker Chocolate Cake mix then add 1 Cup of mashed very ripe bananas.  I still had two small bananas left over so we mixed those in too and baked in a bundt pan. We left it the oven for 15 minutes longer than the box recommended.  The result was a very moist, delicious cake. We were glad we had added the extra bananas as the bananas flavor was still subtle.  We had planned  to ice the cake but decided against it after tasting the cake.  A little sprinkled powdered-sugar adds just enough sweetness.  Everyone in the family loves this new cake.  We will try it with different flavors of cake mix.  Hope this helps other confused readers.

Sorry - this recipe did not turn out well at all. for me. It was so thick that I could barely get it in the pan.  Turned out quite dry.  No one would eat it.

Moist, wonderful cake.  I made a two layer round cake and it worked perfectly.  Somebody's review said to make the recipe on the cake box and then add the rest of the ingredients from the online recipe -- no, no, no.... only add the ingredients that are listed in the recipe... not the cake box.  Served at a birthday party with 35 people and it received rave reviews.  Can't go wrong with this one.

So simple and so good.  I made two 9" cakes and put whipped cream, bananas and banana pudding between the layers.  I then iced the whole thing with cream cheese icing.

This is DELICIOUS! I don't understand the person who said it did not turn out - the only way you could mess this up is if you did not measure the mashed bananas.  I used 3 bananas and that was exactly one cup.  I also added a handful of chocolate chips.  I made a basic buttercream frosting.  My family LOVED it!

Okay, after reading reviews, here is what I did. I made the recipe exactly as stated here because I noticed that the eggs/oil was the same in this recipe as it is on the box. The only modification is that I added the water that the box said to put in the cake mix. It turned out perfectly moist and soft. I frosted with peanut butter frosting. Yum!

Good cake!  I used the ingredients on back of box with was the 1/3 c. oil, the three eggs, and there was 1 1/3 cup water.  Added the bananas, and also added 1/4 cup of sour cream, and t tbsp. flour, which is  something I always do with a box cake mix, a lady who does cakes for  living taught me that.  Makes a great cake!  Also added a tsp. or a little more on cinnamon....made it extra special!

Absolutely Sinful! Rave reviews! However I used a secret ingredient. 1. Opted to make it a round cake, also got store bought chocolate cream cheese frosting, microwaved and drizzled over. Then added chopped pecans. I was afraid after reading other reviews that it wouldnt be moist, so I whipped out a secret ingredient. BABY FOOD. Yep, I have a 5 month old and he has a jar of bananas. I added 3 ozof baby food and I got rave reviews of people asking how I got the perfect combination of banana and chocolate. They also commented on how moist it was. My husband asked where this was for his birthday! He is even more proud to call me his wife now (lol) :) The box recipe for the cake called for the same ingredients as this one, except for water, so I added 1/2c water. Must try with the baby food, it will not dissapoint!

Soooooo easy! The whole family loved it - even my daughter who usually turns her nose up at anything using ripe bananas! Thanks for the recipe. One hint: watch while baking to make sure you don't overcook - it would take away from the moist deliciousness of the cake!

Very good and very easy!
I've long made a chocolate cherry cake similar to this-just use cherry pie filling in place of the banana.
Thanks for a tasty alternative.

I make this a lot, especially for the boys at my husband's work. They always ask when I'm going to bring more. ;) This works with any cake mix you have on hand. I especially like it made with spice cake mix and spreading cream cheese for breakfast.

I made the cake according to package directions and then added the extra eggs, oil, and bananas.  It was WONDERFULLY moist, and extra yummy with Peanut Butter Frosting from this site.  Heaven!

It tastes pretty good!  I wanted to make more of a chocolate banana bread, so I halved the recipe, used a little more than a cup of bananas, 1/4 cup of oil, and replaced eggs with 4T of mayo.  I baked in a 8x4" bread pan for 50 minutes.

I made this cake for my bf, who loved it. My roommates and bf ate the entire cake in 1 day. I personally didn't like it as much as they did, but i still thought it was pretty good. it kinda reminded me of chocolate dipped bananas.

Gosh there are a lot of different ways people interpreted this recipe!  Too bad the instructions were not more explicit.  I just mixed up the devil's food cake mix per instructions on the box and added in one cup of bananas.  The banana taste is not very noticable at all but my goodness does it ever make a fabulously moist, dense cake.  Frosted it with cream cheese icing and it was a hit with everyone, even my son who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth.

Reading all the reviews made preparing this cake confusing. So I prepared the cake as shown in the directions and the batter was very thick; almost brownie like. In fear of a dry cake I add the ingredients from the cake box. My cake turned out extremely moist. I also frosted the cake with a yummi buttercream icing. I made the cake yesterday afternoon and there isnt any left for after dinner tonight..lol :)

This cake really surprised me. I usually do not like cake mix cakes but this cake turned out great. Do not add the ingredients that the box says to add!  You only need the ingredients listed in this recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

LOVED this! SO simple, great moist taste. Made into cupcakes, cooking around 20-23 min,used 3 overripe bananas, added mini chocolate chips in the batter and sprinkled on top of finished product - used Cream Cheese frosting from this site - got raves from friends, who went back for seconds!

this cake was wonderful and very moist. was worried if it would be dry because of the few reviews that said it was very dry, so I added 1/2 cup water. It definately did not need it. I don't understand why some people had dry cakes. I used 4 medium very ripe bananas to make sure it was very bananay. Next time I think I will do it with a german chocolate mix and frost with german chocolate frosting.

This was a great, easy recipe prepared 1 hr before guests arrived.  I used sliced bananas inside the cake layers as well as on top of cake.  Everyone thought it was TERRIFIC!  Will make again.

I followed the instructions on the cake mix (used sugar free chocolate cake mix) plus added 2 medium mashed bananas, 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons splenda, and 1/8 teaspoon salt...came out moist and delicious!  Used sugar free frosting recipe on this site that uses cream cheese, sf pudding, and sf cool whip.  YUMMY!

I did my own spin on this recipe, and made cupcakes!

I bought Kroger brand Devil's food cake mix and followed instructions on box (3 eggs, 1 & 1/3 C water, 1/2 C oil)

I added: 1 C mashed bananas(3 bananas), 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 C sour cream (the secret ingredient!)
This batter easily makes 30 cupcakes.

Allow to cool completely and frost with a homemade cream cheese frosting.

These are actually great!!!! I definitely taste the banana but it's not that strong. I only used half the cake mix because I didn't need a lot of cupcakes. So I only used half of everything the box recipe said (box stated 3 eggs, I used 2 and used 2 bananas). Came out very moist! And stays moist for days!!

Very good!  I followed the recipe as listed (did not add the ingredients from the back of the cake box).  Used 3 over-ripe medium sized bananas.  Baked as a bundt cake 350 degrees for 40 minutes.

Honestly, I pretty much "guess"timated and it turned out FANTASTIC! I used Duncan Hines devil's food boxed cake mix, four bananas and the amount called for on the back of the box for the eggs and oil.  I first added about 3/4 to a cup of water until the batter was moist and of good consistency and baked in the oven until a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean.  This was a good mix from everyday banana bread which I make quite often.  Next time, I will make these into MUFFINS as they are very moist, light and full of chocolate and banana flavor! If this recipe does not turn out for you, PLEASE TRY AGAIN! If you love chocolate and banana, this is awesome!

I used betty crocker cake mix.  I mashed three bananas so there was a little more then a cup.  The batter looked too thick so I added a 1/2 cup of water. This cake was delicious, everyone loved it.

Nowhere in this recipe does it say to prepare the Devils Food cake mix as directed on the box.  That's NOT what the recipe indicates nor is is necessary if you do this properly.  Yes, the final product is thick, almost like brownie batter. I could tell by reading this that there was enough liquid..I mean oil, eggs and mushy ripe bananas are definitely sufficient.   I followed it to a "T".  I made it in a bundt pan, and I and everyone else agreed that it tasted like chocolate banana bread.  It was easy, looked nice, but was nothing incredible.

wow. this has to be one of my favorite cakes ever! you can have it for days, maybe a couple weeks and it is still very moist and delicious. I did just keep the cake in for a little bit longer to have the middle not sink in. I make this cake for anyday and I just a couple hours ago made it for a birthday cake! delicious, thanks for the recipe! :)

I did not add the ingredients called for on the cake mix box...just the ones in this recipe and it turned out great! It was very light, fluffy and moist. I made sure that my bananas were very ripe and I mixed it on 'high' for 2 minutes. Be sure not to overbake it. Thanks.

I added extra eggs and oil to the recipe just to be on the safe side.  Still, this just tasted like  boxed cake mix with an essence of banana.  Nobody ate more than one slice.  Not bad or dry...just blah.  I can't understand all the rave reviews.

I accidently grabed a box of brownie mix, when it was all mixed up it was very thin, so I added a half cup of flour and it seemed thick enough.  The result is that it taste even better with a brownie mix than a cake mix, in our opinion

Very interesting flavor; I added the cup of bananas and then since the box needed a cup and a third of water, I added an additional 1/3 c water to the cake. It turned out very well, so I am going to guess that the moisture level of the cake depends on the amount of water the box recipe calls for. I also added 1/2 a pkg of dark choc chips and frosted it with my own concoction of a chocolate cream cheese frosting. Yummy!

MMMMM!! I made cupcakes with this recipe with a few of my own touches-- I used three and a half large bananas, i used jumbo eggs and one had 2 yolks, i added milk chocochips and i took them out of the oven after 16 min to ensure they didn't dry out.  They were good plain but I added store bought coconut pecan frosting and they are decadant!  Fun, easy and deliscious!

These were delicious! I used a box of Betty Crocker's Triple Fudge Cake mix and 3 ripe bananas. This recipe made 30 cupcakes. The cake itself is light in flavor, yet perfectly moist and beyond appetizing. MAKE THE CAKE MIX PER BOX INSTRUCTIONS. A very important step I think a lot of bad reviewers forewent. Excellent with this frosting: 2 cups powder sugar, 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter and 4 tablespoons milk blend well and frost away. I made these for my son's birthday and they were divine!

Wonderful cake when you're in a hurry.  I subbed an extra banana for the oil.  Frosted the cake  with a combo of dry sugar-free  banana pudding and fat-free chocolate Cool Whip and kept it refrigerated until ready to serve.  I imagine you could do the same with a from-scratch cake.

3 large mashed bananas, yellow cake mix, 1/3 cup cocoa (to make it chocolate), 1/3 cup water & the 3 eggs & 1/3 c. oil as directed in this recipe. Added 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips per other reviewers. Baked in a Bundt pan for 38 minutes till toothpick ready. Cooled & covered in Chocolate Ganache from this  site. Teenagers comment: "This is so Bomb!" Have not tasted it yet, but 17 year old was calling his friends to come over here to taste it! Conversation overheard; "Dude, You need to come over & taste this Bomb Cake My Mom Made!"

This is a very, very yummy cake! And so easy!  I found it to be light and airy, not real moist, but definitely not dry!  I followed the recipe given (not adding anything to the cake itself other than what this calls for).  I did make 12 cupcakes and 6 mini loaves, so the baking time was different (15 minutes for the cupcakes and 22 minutes for the loaves).  I then drizzled melted white chocolate on the tops once cooled.  I, definitely, will make this again!

I made this with just a few changes. I used 1/2 cup of coconut oil (my box of mix said to use 1/2 a cup-not 1/3), 2 cups of bananas bevause i had a lot, and sprinkled chocolate chips on top. It made two big loaves of soft and delicious choc banana cake. This was a great easy recipe!

Even though this recipe only has 4 ingredients it is fabulous!!! It is so moist and the chocolate and banana go so well together!  I used 1 1/4 cups of bananas instead of 1 cup. I made these into cupcakes for my child care and the kids loved them!! Brillant idea for busy mom's!!

Very good, but I agree with the other reviewers that you should follow the directions on the back of the box. My husband and son really enjoyed this cake. It only lasted about 24 hours!

I didn't mind using a cake mix, the box mix turns out a better cake than scratch for me :)  As another reviewer did I used cake mix ingredients and the recipes ingredients except omitted the last 1/3 cup oil.  Three medium bananas made a moist delish Bundt style cake.  Chocolate cream cheese frosting was very good on this.

For the very first time, I neglected to read the comments for this recipe. Too bad! Since it does NOT say to use the box recipe, I did not use the water and it is dry. If I were to add these ingredients to the box recipe, it would include 6 EGGS!!! So, I am giving this a thumbs down. I had added bananas to chocolate batter before, and had pleasant results.. I will go back to doing that.  Same goes for all the other recipes that do not use the water... this is an error. Kudos to the person who said the recipes should mention 'use the box directions plus...'

It was so awesome and yummy!  The banana flavor wasn't overpowering like some other recipes I have tried.  I made mini bunt cakes out of them and just followed the cup cake instructions on the box.  They will be perfect for company.  I also sent the recipe onto my mom and they just love it too.

Delicious! I used dark chocolate cake mix instead as that's what I had on hand. Batter was extremely thick, almost glue-like, when I tried to pour it into the pan. I baked mine in a greased/floured Bundt pan instead of a 9x13 pan for 35 minutes. I loved it - will be making this again.

The first time I made this cake was for a Cake and Ice Cream Church Social.  It got rave reviews. It's now the only Chocolate Cake I ever make.  I didn't have frosting in the house so I melted Semi-Sweet Chocolate and drizzled it over the cake, then melted White Chocolate and drizzled that over the cake also.   It was out of this world.... I now get the many requests for this cake.

We really liked this cake. The banana flavor is strong enough to compete with the chocolate and the combination is really interesting.  I used a basic white frosting and added a little sour cream and water to the batter to make sure it wasn't too dry. I'm sure it would have stayed nice and moist if the family hadn't eaten it so fast.

I ended up using a Marble cake mix and they came out very moist.  I only added what is listed on the ingredients and nothing extra and didn't put in extra ingredients to make the cake mix first.   I did put in a bit more oil though.

This recipe was very moist and delicious. I mixed the cake according to the box and then added the extra oil and eggs. However, the box called for 1/2c oil and I used applesauce and I put in 1/3c oil as the recipe states. I also used 1 less egg overall, 1/4c less water, and 3 large bananas instead of 2.

I always put ripe bananas in the freezer to use later.  This is a good recipe for that purpose!  I did use 1/2 cup water to moisten up the recipe a bit.

This was a dry cake--even my husband said that.  Still eating on it.  In order to get rid of it pouring a little milk over it isn't so bad.  Unless it's really bad, we never throw anything out.

This turned out GREAT!!!! I used a chocolate fudge cake mix, 3 bananas and added some walnuts and actually whipped the batter and made cupcakes. They came out plenty moist and very light with a wonderful banana flavor. One of my new favorites!!!

After reading several reviews that said this cake was dry, I looked at the basic cake recipe on the box and made sure that all wet ingredients were equal in measurement. I made sure the bananas were brought to the amount of water for cake and that the oil was the same. The cake turned out great. Next time I am going to try adding chocolate chips to the batter as one reviewer did. Thank you for the great recipe.

Outstanding if you like bananas! I read reviews and increased mashed bananas to 1 1/2c and oil to 1/2c. Whipped it well in the blender. Very nice and fluffy, flavorful cake!

I should have read more reviews before I made this cake because mine is dry and doesn't taste good at all. And I did use a name brand devils food cake mix. I'm not trying it again.

This was great!  I did not add the other ingredients that the box said to add for normal cake-making.  Just the bananas, oil, and eggs.  I did sprinkle some milk chocolate chips over it before I baked it.  My family loved it and it was very moist.  What a simple and delicious recipe!

This turned out ok. I followed the recipe on my box but I substituted one cup of the water for the cup of bananas. My box called for 1 1/3 cup water, and I should have used banana in place of all of the water, because the banana flavor wasn't very strong.

Like some other users I made two layers. I iced between the two layers and included a layer of banana slices.

i didn't have any devils food cake, so i used marble cake mix, and baked it in a bundt pan. omg! yummy! this was SOOOO easy, and delicious to boot. i iced it with a simple icing sugar/vanilla/water glaze frosting, and wowed my guests with absolutely no effort. will make again for sure!! the banana taste is so subtle, it is almost not noticeable unless you know it's there!

There was so much discussion on this recipe, I almost didn't make it.  I followed the recipe as written, The batter didn't seem too thick.  I watched the cake very closly as not to over bake.  To my amazement, the cake was very dry.  The only saving grace was the whipped cream and banana filling.  I would not bake this cake again.

I had a box of reduced sugar devils food cake mix in the cupboard that I was afraid to use....so I thought this might just add just the right thing to cover up any after taste it may have.  Hubby (who is the pickiest eater alive) liked it!  Ate 2 pieces the first night.  I frosted it with regular canned chocolate frosting....I thought it was okay.  Don't know if I'd make it again...but overall not a bad recipe.

We all loved this cake, particularly on the second day.  It was very moist and a good blend of banana and chocolate - one didn't outdo the other.  I used the bananas, oil and eggs as stated and then added water to make the amount liquid equal what the box called for.  Good cake!

Delicious.  Not too "banana-y" and great chocolate flavor.  A great way to get rid of ripe bananas without always making banana bread!

Very good!  Sprinkled mini-chocolate chips on top before baking it.  It was really enjoyed by my daughter-in-law who loves chocolate covered bananas.

I was dissapointed with this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, but cooked it in a Bundt pan following the cooking directions on the box.  The cake was dry.  I don't believe the Bundt would cause that problem.  I even put on a chocolate glaze but it didn't help.  I am a single person with this cake and was planning on giving it to others but since I don't have the desire to eat it I don't think I will.  It was an easy to follow recipe and it made my apartment smell wonderful.

I'm sorry.  This was the dry-est cake I have ever made.  And yes, I know how to follow a recipe.  I don't know what could have happened, I bake all the time, so I don't think it was my oven.  I just don't know.  I send stuff to work with my husband frequently, and he's never thrown anything away until now, but this didn't get eaten.  I was kindof embarassed, to be truthful.  I even topped it with the chocolate cheese frosting from this site, but no go.  Sorry.  Would never try this one again.

Maybe add that you are supposed to mix cake mix as per directions as step 2 before next steps ..
I don’t like reading reviews to find out something is going to go wrong

I did not know I was supposed to make the cake mix first, then add the other ingredients. I did not like the flavor or texture. I may make it again knowing the correct way to do it now.  But it would have been nice to know ALL steps to making this before I put it in the oven.

I read every review. Followed the cake box directions plus added all that was listed. Maybe I should have added an extra banana or tablespoon of flour like some suggested but I doubt that would have made a difference. One person said they added chocolate chips, that sounded delish - so I did too. The problem I had was this was VERY RUNNY! All the chips sank to the bottom of the bowl. I made cupcakes and ran out of liners. The chips sank to the bottom and stuck to the pan I had drenched in oil. Good and moist, but I like thick, dense, flavorful treats. I probably won't make this again. Not worth the  experiment to me. Good luck and enjoy if it turns out for you.

I made this as written but I had 4 frozen bananas which mashed down to about 1 1/4c.  and I added in about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.  This was a very moist cake with a surprise of banana.  It did not need the water or extra eggs as others suggested.  Just follow this recipe.  Thank you for an easy recipe.

I think if the ingredients on the box needed to be followed , then the rest of the ingredients added , that should have been stated.
It was a bit dry. Had good taste.

Delicious, moist. Follow this recipe not box. I made it as a layer cake,put cool whip with fresh banana and strawberry slices in center and more cool whip and fresh fruit slices to top. Then milk chocolate shavings on top. My family has a new birthday cake favorite.  I used a little more mashed banana and about a 1/4 cup water to batter. Was perfect. Not too sweet,tastes a little like chocolate banana bread.

A wonderful cupcake! I added 3 bananas to a measuring cup and added water until it reached the amount that was listed on the mix and then I added a cup of chopped chocolate chips, both were suggested by another member (she used mini chips, but I didn't have any)  FABULOUS!

I've made this twice and it's fantastic-- people can't get enough of it. I followed the recipe as written but added some extra banana (I used 3 large ripe bananas), a tablespoon of four and 1/4 cup Greek yogurt (as we didn't have any sour cream). I baked it in a bundt pan for 36 minutes and it was perfect, moist, yummy and best of all incredibly easy.
