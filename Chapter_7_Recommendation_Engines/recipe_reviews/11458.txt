This is a fairly standard and very reliable recipe for classic lemon bars. Any criticism of either too much crust, not enough filling, too sweet or tart, or not sweet or tart enough is purely subjective, and can easily be tweaked to suit individual tastes and preferences. Having made lemon bars many times in the past, and knowing that I like a thicker filling than the standard 4-egg filling for a 9x13" pan, I chose to use 1-1/2 times the filling for the same amount of crust, keeping all other measurements the same.  I liked the addition of the lemon zest in this recipe, and found these to have the perfect balance of juice and zest for a just right sweetness and tartness. If possible, use either a non-melting powdered sugar, or sprinkle the powdered sugar right before serving, as it tends to melt into the bars quickly. I had a taste for something lemon today, and since these are so quick and easy to make they quickly satisfied the craving!

This is an great, simple recipe that I make with my 3 year old. If you halve the lemons and then nuke them for 10 seconds or so you can get a lot more juice. Super good.

I thought these lemon bars were delicious!  I followed the recipe as it was printed, although I decreased the temperature to 340 and kept a close eye on things, because my oven bakes a bit faster than it should. There was just the right amount of crust and just the right amount of lemony topping. Although some reviews stated they didn't look very nice, I disagree!  They looked fine when they came out, and after they cooled the top was certainly firm enough to withstand a sprinkling of powdered sugar. I'm definitely going to make these again, and i'm also going to try them with a mixture of lemon and lime juices.

I'm not sure why everyone keeps cutting the crust recipe in half. It's just fine as long as you DOUBLE the filling. I didn't have enough lemon juice, so I used half a cup of lemon juice and half a cup of lime juice. They were fabulous. Make sure you whisk the filling until a creamy froth developes. When it bakes it will create a thin wafer of an almost merangue consistancy. Also DO NOT bake the crust longer than 15 minutes. It will be pale and not browned at all on top, but will be completely done, and a lovely golden on the bottom after the filling has been added and it's been in the oven for another 20 to 25 min. (max.)If the edges start to brown...take it out immediately. It is definately done. Be sure to watch it if you leave it in longer than 20 minutes.

Definitely a good lemon bar, but not lemony enough. I have made this many times now and I add the zest of a full lemon to make them really tangy. If you add more lemon juice they can get too runny. But, you really do need to cook this longer than 20 mins (at least 25-28). I personally love the thick shortbread crust. Sprinkle with powdered sugar just before serving or it just soaks into the bar (powdered sugar makes them look much more appetizing and pretty!)

I followed the recipe exact, making no changes. I found that baking the crust for 15 minutes was exact as was baking the filling for 20 minutes. I had no problems with burning or overdone anything like I have with other lemon bars. I couldn't wait to cut into this, so I let it cool for about 20 minutes before I dusted it with confectioners sugar and another 10 minutes after that before I couldn't wait anymore. The crust is almost shortbread like and the filling is better than others I've tried. I think it's good as is, but for someone who likes more filling and a little more sour filling, I might double the filling next time and at least double the zest. The reviewer before me is right in describing the filling as close to a lemon meringue. NOTE: The filling looks to be thin and you'll worry that it won't set up. It will. It's supposed to look like that. EDITED: Once it cools, the filling's tartness comes out a bit more and it's quite creamy. I think some of the other reviewers are right in making a batch and a half of the filling. I think it might be perfect then.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly and thought that there was too much crust.  So I made them again and cut the flour back to 1 1/2 cups (mixed with the powdered sugar) and 3 Tblsps added to the egg/lemon juice mix. I used cold butter and cut it in to the flour with a pastry blender.  I left all of the other ingredient amounts the same and thought this was a perfect ratio of crust to filling.  I enjoy the taste of these bars best when they are chilled... An absolutely scrumptious "the best" recipe!

I made these based on the picture shown....that must be two bars stacked on top of each other.  I made it the original recipe way, but next time I will definitely DOUBLE the filling so it is more of a 2:1 RATIO instead of 1:1.

This was OK, but not great.  Crust was a little too thick, it over powered the filling.  Maybe it would be better if you used the same amount of crust and spread in a jelly roll pan, then made 1&1/2 times the lemon filling.

I followed other reviewer's comments & did the crust as written, but the filling 1 & 1/2 of how it was written...a 5-star with these changes!! 
So:
Crust: 2 C Flour, 1/2 C Icing Sugar, 1 C Butter.
Filling: 6 Eggs, 2 + 1/4 C Sugar, 3/4 C Lemon Juice, 1 & 1/2 Tbsp Lemon Zest, 6 Tbsp Flour.

I would definitely recommend this recipe over the Bake Sale Lemon Bars recipe on this website.  I did a batch and a half for the filling, and the outcome was delicious!  These lemon bars definitely have tangy zing to them, but still have a nice sweetness about them.  I used bottled lemon juice, so I didn't have any zest to add in.  Instead I just add slightly more lemon juice to the mixture.  I was left with a gooey delicious filling on top of a light and flaky crust.  Part of the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the author of the recipe didn't denote to reserve the 1/4 extra cup of flour for later in the ingredient section.  2 c. of flour is for the crust and the 1/4 c. of flour is to be added to the filling.  I mistakenly added 2 1/4 c. to the crust because the ingredient list doesn't specify.  If you too make this mistake, don't worry, it still turns out wonderful.  Regardless though, the ingredient list should have that added into it.  Definitely try this recipe...it's a keeper!  Just read it carefully.

Whether you like more filling or less crust, it doesn't change the fact that the combination of flavors of this lemon pie bar are fantastic and perfect. I love the simplicity, flavor, and texture of this shortbread crust and it holds up very well to the liquid. The lemon filling is FABULOUS! I made double the filling b/c my pregnant self has been on a lemon kick for months now and it really hit the spot. I do think that the written amount of crust to lemon filling would be just fine with us, too. Halved the recipe so I used a 9" deep dish pie plate and it worked out well, like a tart. Served beautifully with the dusting of powdered sugar. Hubster loved this dessert and we gobbled it up over several days (it is very good chilled!). Thanks for sharing the great recipe! :)

It was my first time to make Lemon Bars and it turned out very well! After reading some reviews I've decided to increase my filling to 1 1\2 portions and it was the right decision, the ratio of crust\filling was 1:1. I had to bake it longer though. I started with 20 min and have been adding 5 min at a time, checking for readiness each time and in summary it took 15 minutes longer. I also had to reduce the T to 320F and cover the top with foil after 20 min of baking since it started to get brown on the top but was still liquid inside. Next time I will bake it at 340F and put it on a lower rack. I used 2 lemons - zest and juice, it tasted just right - very lemony! Will definitely make it again!

These were good, the right balance of sweet/tart...Maybe if I'd of spread the crust up the sides of my 9x13 dish it wouldn't have been too thick...After seeing how thick the crust was I made 1-1/2 the filling recipe but with 2 full Tablespoons of zest & the filling was very nice...I might add cornstarch instead of flour to the filling next time & waiting to dust them with powdered sugar until they are completely cooled is a must. Really good though!

Pretty good.  I'd like the lemon part to be thicker and the crust to be a little thinner.  I used juice and zest of two lemons.

Very easy recipe and delicious also. I found that by beating the filling for four minutes before pouring over crust I obtained a nicer looking final product. I also then only had to bake 20 minutes for it to set well. Thanks for the recipe

Loved it. Everyone who had it tonight loved it. I doubled the filling and had to bake it a little longer, for a total of 28 minutes, but it came out great. Also added a little extra lemon juice and zest since I had some delicious Meyer lemons and wanted to taste them!

Often times in the kitchen, you'll find that the simplest recipes are the best. This recipe proves that corollary. Beautiful, uncomplicated flavors that let the lemon, with exquisite tartness, shine through. Few ingredients, simple to whip up in minutes, you'll reach for this recipe again and again. A+

These are fantastic! Very lemony and easy. I found that 1-times the crust and 1.5-times the filling made for a better proportioned bar. However, you have to watch the time in the oven. It says to bake "until it sets" but you will burn the edges if you do. The centre can be a little runny, but it WILL set when cooled. Others suggest to take out when edges are golden brown, but with the extra (1.5x) filling volume, you will see that the centre is still too runny. You can let the edges go to just medium brown to make sure that the centre sets after you take it out. It will still be a little runny in the middle, but that's ok. These freeze very well and thaw quickly. I trim off a wee bit of the darker edges (and eat them - I call them the "Baker's Treat") and then I cut them into serving sizes and freeze them on a cookie sheet. Once frozen, don't just bag or stack them - lay them flat on wax papered cardboard, bag them and store level in the freezer. A simple and popular treat!

So so good! I love lemon bars and so I love that this recipe makes a big pan.  The crust is yummy, the filling is yummy.  WITH NO CHANGES!!!  I've tried a lot of different lemon bar recipes.  I've made this one 3 times, and this is the one I plan on using from now on.

I have not made these yet but I plan on doing so,very soon. I read on another site that you can sift together 1 tsp cornstarch and 1 cup of powdered sugar and that will prevent the powdered sugar dusting from melting away. I hope this works!!

Yummy lemon bars perfect amount of sweet and sour, the base of the bar was fine for the amount of curd.  The only change I made was to use regular white sugar for the crust 1/2 cup instead of icing sugar. Will use this recipe again thanks.

This is TRULY an easy recipe to do. I came across a TON of limes and made it with them instead of lemons and now I can't make them fast enough!!! The wife LOVES them!!! Also if you make JUST the crust and cut them into squares and put frosting in between 2 of the squares, they will disappear as well!!!!

These are great.  I took the suggestions of others and i made 1 1/2 times the filling.  They are tart but GREAT.  Be sure to use fresh lemon juice.

These lemon bars are DIVINE!  I took the advice of others and made 1 1/2 the amount of filling and it's perfect.  I cooked it all at 350, cooked the crust for 20 minutes and 20 minutes for the filling and they turned out just perfect.  I couldn't wait too long before I taste tested them to make sure none of them were "poisonous."  ;) The prefect combination of sweetness and tartness... really mouthwatering!  Will be making these again and again!  NOM!

Delicious!  Perfect texture and lemon taste.  I made 1 1/2 times the filling.  Let the bars cool completely before sifting powdered sugar on top.

These turned out great.  They were easy.  Next time I will make sure the crust gets browned enough (the shortbread could have been a little crisper).  I used the filling from this in a pre-baked pie crust and topped it with cool-whip- great pie for a bbq.

I defiantly recommend  1 -1/2 times the filling. Other than that the recipe is perfect! Just right on the sweet and tart flavor. This recipe is a keeper. My family loves it!

This was a very good and easy recipe to make.  I would only make one change to the recipe.(hence the 4 stars) I only bake with unsalted butter, so my crust was really needing something - a pinch of salt!  It was just a little bland and a touch of salt would have made a huge difference.  Next time I make this I will add 1/2 tsp of salt to the crust.

Also, in the interest of ease and keeping it simple, I prepared this completely in my food processor.  I processed the dry ingredients for the crust in the food processor, added the COLD butter (diced) and processed until it was incorporated.  After putting the crust into the oven to bake, used the same food processor to mix up the filling.  Simple and easy!

These were good -- a little sweet for my taste.  I agree the crust was too thick, even halving the filling recipe again.  I don't think the problem is the recipe -- I think it's the pan size.  I might try in a slightly bigger pan or jelly roll pan next time.

After reading other reviews, I decided to keep the crust as the recipe states, but make 1.5 times the filling.  All I can say is...WOW!  I'm happy I made that change - to me it was the perfect crust to filling ratio.  If you like a lot of crust, then make it as the recipe states.  I would have given 5 stars if the recipe had it with more filling, but as for taste, I think it's perfect!

My kids loved these lemon bars! I also liked them, but think I would follow other reviewers suggestions and double the filling next time, they were a little light on filling.  Made exactly as directed.

From reading the reviews there is a lot of debate on how much crust, how much filling, how sweet the filling should be. I thought it was prefect as is. The crust is thick enough that you know that it is made of shortbread and the filling is thick enough to really add some wonderful flavor. I also was happy with the sweetness too. This recipe makes a rather sweet filling.

Sooo happy with this recipe! I needed to bring a dessert to easter dinner, & since I had all the ingredients, I decided to give this a try(I thought it would be a nice,"light" change to the other heavy,way sweet options I knew would be there) I followed recipe exactly, though I think I should've taken it out a few min sooner, it tasted WONDERFUL! My lemons had been sitting in my fruit bowl for well over a week & it was still fabulous. So easy a quick too!  I'm not big on sweets, but I'll need no arm twisting to make this again & again! Thanks so much!

Loved these lemon bars.  The first time I made these, I followed the recipe to a T.  However, I am a big lemon fan, so the next time, I added about 2 TBS zest to the crust, added about 3 TBS zest to the filling and finished them off with a lemon glaze on top.  The glaze was made with 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 4 TBS lemon juice.  Absolue heaven!  Thanks for sharing!

The PROS:  very easy to make, very zesty and tangy filling
THe CONS:  super thick (but tasty) crust overpowers the filling
This was still a nice recipe and it went over well but next time I make this (and I will) I will double (or 1 1/2 times) the ingredients for the filling and maybe add a little baking powder or soda (forget which one works best with lemon) to "puff" up the filling even more.

These turned out absolutely perfect! I used the zest of an entire lemon to give them a little extra zing. The crust came out beautifully--light and buttery. This recipe is definitely going in my recipe box. My family will be expecting it again...and again...and again...

The best lemon bars I have ever made.  It was the perfect amount of tartness.  I found that the crust and filling ratio was right on.  That said, if you don't find the ratio to your personal liking, simply adjust!  I took this to my 83 year old grandmothers today and made her day.  She loved them!

I doubled the filling and kept the same amount of crust.  I'm glad I did, I don't think there would have been enough filling if I didn't.  Great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic!  Easy to prepare and make and tasted delicious :0)  It was a little tricky getting the bars out of my baking pan, but I just made a cut all the way down the center and used a spatula to lift each half out and them cut them up at that point.  These were a HUGE hit with friends and family.

I've used this exact recipe for years.  Butter is a must to get the great crust.  I love lemon flavor so I up the lemon zest to almost 2 tablespoons.  And, instead of sprinkling with powdered sugar, I use a thin glaze made of lemon juice, zest, and powdered sugar.  It's really more lemony that way.

I love lemon desserts and this one is wonderful. I LOVE lemon meringue and every birthday a cake with lemon filling. So, I scaled the recipe down to about half the servings, since it's just for 2 and 32 is quite a bit and I think in doing so I accidentally added a tablespoon or two more flour into the lemon mixture - it created a super thin and smooth cake crust top but still had the tender lemon layer underneath that was thick and warm and absolutely delicious! Actually, the thin little cake crust didn't hurt it at all and the bottom crust was tender, buttery and perfect. Next time I'll watch that (the flour) just because I love the appearance of the original. This is SOOOOO good. I ate three straight from the oven - perfect and lemony! YUM!!! Thank you so much for sharing this one!!!

I used this filling over a sugar cookie crust because I had it left over from another bar cookie recipe. The only change i made to the filling was adding some grated lemon zest to it. All I could say is WOW! it was soo good. The filling is very creamy and lemony. I did not dust with sugar becase the crust was so sweet and it was perfect. A really great balance of sweet and sour. I highly recommend adding some lemon zest as it really brings out the lemon flavor without making it more sour. Just grate up the zest from the lemon you are going to use for the juice but do it before you squeeze it otherwise it could be difficult.

These tasted really good! We finished a pan in about five minutes... and the next time I made it I had to make three whole pans ;) Other reviewers said there was not enough filling, so I made it with 1 1/2 the amount of filling and the ratio was perfect. These are really great for summer because of the lemon. This is the recipe I fall back on every time I want to make lemon bars.

I have never had luck with anything lemon except maybe a cake.  The filling never sets up for some reason.  I am happy to report that I had great success with these.  Some had complained that there was too much crust.  Mine had equal crust and filling, which is perfect for my taste.  The crust is yummy - flakey and buttery and holds together well when you cut it.  I stored in the fridge overnight.  In the morning I dabbed the top with a paper towel slightly before putting on the powdered sugar.  Seemed to help it not to melt away as fast. I will be making this again.

I did a few modifications and they turned out to be amazing. I added lemon, lime and orange juice and zest. More lemon then anything else and it ended up being a great call. I also have to say that if you're going to rate any recipe and rate it poorly due to your own modifications then that's just simply sad. If you follow the recipe and end up disliking it then I completely get it. I think it shows stupidity when you rate something bad due to your mess up. I just had to put that out there cause some of the reviews I've read blow my mind and I wonder why thier so....well.. you know. Sorry for the rant. Have a nice day :-)

I have made these lemon squares many times, most recently for a baby shower, and they went over so well many people asked for the recipe! The one change that I made is that I doubled the lemon filling; I did have to bake it for longer though to be set.  Also, I learned that you cannot pour the lemon filling over the hot crust because the filling and crust end up sort of melting together.  I waited about 10-15 minutes before pouring the filling on the crust and this made a big difference.  These bars are not easy to cut, so you definitely need to have a really sharp knife on hand and a good spatula to get them out of the pan.

I have made this recipe countless times! Every single person that has tried it is absolutely in love with it. To add some extra flavor I always use fresh squeezed lemon juice, I think it really does make a difference. The crust is the perfect compliment to the gooey lemony topping. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I'm about to make yet another batch right now!

This was the easiest recipe I could find. The result was super tasty.

Next time I think I will half the recipe for the crust and use the same amount of filling into a 8x8 pan for a thicker filling and less crust.

Also, we made a 2nd batch using orange zest & orange juice in place of the lemon. Everyone liked the orange better.

I agree with some of the other reviewers.  I'm going to reduce the crust next time.  I also found that it didn't taste lemony enough, so I'm going to use 2 rinds instead of 1 next time.  Overall, they were delicious!! Everyone loved them.

This recipe is very delicious, and pretty fool proof considering that I totally messed a couple things up and it still turned out tasting great!  At others' suggestion I did end up doubling the filling mixture, which seemed like the perfect ratio of lemon to crust to me.  The mistakes I made inadvertently made the dessert healthier, so if anyone was interested I used 4 real eggs, and 1 cup of eggbeaters because I ran out of real eggs, used splenda blend white sugar in place of powdered in the crust because I didn't have powdered, and only used the equivalent of 1.5 cups of the splenda blend in the filling, even though I doubled all the other ingredients, because I forgot.  Still extremely tasty, but look forward to staying true to the original next time

Mmmm... perfect! The filling is perfect, and the shortbread crust compliments it beautifully! I did make 1 1/2 times the filling, with only 5 eggs instead of 6. It came out great! The filling had the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I have to say, next time I will stick to the original amount of filling and crust... only because I am a big fan of shortbread cookies! Overall, they were really good!

I give it four stars because even though the taste was decent, for us, not lemony enough... I think next time I will double the lemon juice, zest, sugar and eggs to make it thicker.  My first time making these, they turned out with more crust than 'filling'.  Not like a lemon pie or any other pie.  Since most pies have more filling than crust.  So, if you just like the idea of a lot of crust and a little filling, make it as is, otherwise I would double the recipe for the filling part.  Kinda wishing I went with the recommendations to double it from the start, but I just kept thinking 8 Eggs!!  :o  But I guess that's what I'll do if I try it again.  It was quick and easy to make.  So for something fast and lemony it's a good recipe.

These lemon bars were wonderful! I did add one additional egg plus a bit more lemon juice (about 2/3 cup total) but no extra sugar. My kids and my nieces loved these!

Mmmm, so good! After looking at the photos before making this I could see that many bars looked to be about equal depth of filling and crust. I wanted a thicker filling so I did 1.5 times the filling amount and it was just right.  Just perfectly lemony, we loved these!

I would give this 4.5 but not 5, they arent quite as lemony as I would like and I used more lemon juice, and more zest than required. Otherwise AMAZING, and UBER simple!

I made these yesterday after reading all the reviews and the only thing I changed was to use soft spread instead of butter. I used all the  2 1/4 cups  of flour to make the pastry and added an extra 3 tablespoons of flour to make up for the 'softness' of the spread. I made sure to only bake the pastry for 15 minutes and to bake the topped pastry for 20 minutes.  I'm a fairly prolific baker, having earned the name 'The Cake Lady' in my adopted village and  I found the bars were just perfect - my 2 kids agreed - this morning we had only 8 bars remaining out of the original 24.  Thanks Kukadog for sharing!!

Amazing. I had some lemons that needed to be used up and I'm very glad that I used them up on these bars.  I did as so many other's suggested and made 1.5 the amount of filling. Yum, Thanks so much for the recipe)

Excellent as written. I used bottled lemon juice and only had lime zest...made half recipe in an 8x8 pan and cooked for 15 then 18 minutes. Tastes like I remember from the coffee shop!

Made these last night and they were super yummy! Followed the recipe as written except for three tiny changes: I used regular sugar, not powdered, and margarine, not butter, in the crust, and I didn't add the lemon zest. Everybody really loved these.

Amazing! My friend and I whipped this up last nite for dessert and it was pretty good. I had a square for breakfast this morning and it was even better. Now I just need to figure out how to get the crispy crust on top. Darn, I guess that means I have to make it again, shucks, lol. Definately a keeper!

I made these for our Bible study on Friday and they were delicious.  My other recipe was for an 8x8" pan.  I didn't want to just double the recipe so I checked my trusty AR site and found this recipe.  They were delicious.  My husband couldn't stay out of the leftovers.  Only difference I would make is next time I would only use 2 cups of flour.  I also let them cool before I sifted the powdered sugar over the top.  YUM!

These were very good, and very easy to make.  I give them a 4-1/2 because I have had better, but unfortuntely my friend will not share that recipe, this recipe is very close to the best. I would definitely make these for dinner guests or gift for a friend.  Follow other reviewers suggestions and double the filling!  Good recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as written, except for the zest which accidentally got thrown away before I baked the dessert. This is SO good, 1/4 of it is already gone, and it hasn't even cooled yet. So simple, I had everything on hand, and I adore the thick soft buttery shortbread crust.

These were awesome.  Next time I will melt the butter, since I had difficulty getting dough to come anywhere close to adhering together.  Husband insisted I leave some home for him and I took the rest to a sunday school function and the ladies raved about them.

I followed the first reviewer's suggestion and made more filling per crust. The cook-time was 10 minutes longer in my oven. Using fresh eggs, the deep colored yolks made a nice yellow filling. After cooling some, the bars were easy to cut cleanly and everyone absolutely loved them. I think they're better warm not completely cool, but that's just me. These are sure to please your lemon lovers.

I made this using Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour mix and organic lemons. OMG. The taste is amazing. The crust is a bit flaky, which is from the flour mix I used. I expected that from gluten free flour. The organic lemons are a must. So much more lemon flavor. Make these now!

Excellent flavor, texture, and easy prep, but I think the lemon part of it is too skimpy for a 9x13 pan...altho the crust recipe is just right.  Maybe try a smaller pan if you like thicker bars and allow an overnight before cutting.  Also, add extra butter or spray to the sides and corners as the crust likes to stick there and prevents evenly cut bars.

Just made these yesterday and they are so yummy!! Cant stop eating them. I added 2 teas. of baking powder along with the flour for the filling(doubled it) to make them raise taller, and also decreased the sugar to 2 cups. It made them tart and not so sweet. Nice and thick.

After reading the reviews, I had planned on doubling the filling, but at the last minute, decided to try them first as written.  The ONLY change I made was that I forgot to add the reserved 1/4 c. of flour to the filling.  I used my food processor to blend the flour, powdered sugar, and butter (not softened), and the crust was perfect.  I like the crust/filling ratio.  I think it would be overwhelmingly lemony to double the filling.  It took 3 fresh lemons to get the 1/2 cup of juice and 1 T of zest.  For those who aren't familiar with zesting a lemon, only zest the yellow exterior, don't zest into the white.  

And, finally, for those who complained that they weren't as thick as pictured, if you look closely, you can see that the ones in the photo are actually 2 bars stacked. 

 I tried this recipe after trying Chef John's, and prefer this one.  They're delicious! :)

Good recipe but do not add the 4 Tablespoons of flour to the lemon mixture; it makes it taste paste-y.  Use cornstarch instead.  Baked these lemon bars 2 days ago to take to a picnic and they were gone in an hour.  So glad I saved a few at home, lol!

I made this recipe for my daughter's baby shower this weekend.  The overall consensus was they were delicious! None left is proof they were enjoyed by all. Comments like "can i have the recipe" were common.  Recipe is easy, I will make these again.

my attempt at this lemon bar was a disaster. I followed the recipe to the word, the base was perfect, I put the lemon filling on top of the base as instructed and baked it as instructed.
BUT when I took out the slice out of the oven ALL the lemon topping was on the bottom of the base. Not a good look.
The lemon sauce tasted delicious. SO what have I and where have I gone wrong? Someone out there Please tell me.
I am longing to make it again without the the problem of the escape of the sauce. I still feel it desrves 4 stars.

Regards from Whitby Tart.

Made this tonight as written:  The crust seemed to thick, heavy and dense. Not flakey like my normal pie crust. Perhaps I did something wrong? I really liked the flavor of the filling – plenty lemony – and if I do try again I will revisit the crust.

Very good! Don't forget to spray the pan or line it, otherwise edges of bars stick. I followed the recipe, they turned out great.

This was easy, quick and to the point. I ended up using reg sugar for the crust because that's what I had on hand(worked fine). 2 good sized lemons= 1/2 cup lemon juice. When I make these again, and I definitely will, I will add a few drops of yellow food coloring, as these were virtually colorless. This of course is really a non issue but for presentation sake this is what I will do.

I made these for my son's teacher without ever having tried a lemon bar myself, so I have nothing to compare to.  That said, I made these with the 50% increase in filling ingredients.  My only issue is that I wound up undercooking the cookie crust because I was worried about overcooking (as a few reviewers had mentioned).  These tasted fantastic after setting fully overnight in the fridge!  I would definitely make again.

For the filling at 150%, use the following:
3/8 c flour (as opposed to the remaining 1/4),
6 eggs,
2 1/4 c sugar,
3/4 c lemon juice.

These were very disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly. I was making these for a fundraiser and there was hardly any filling on top, in fact, in some parts, the crust showed through. They also stuck to the pan. No where does the recipe advise you to grease or line the pan to prevent sticking. So not only did they stick to the pan, but the crust also fell apart on quite a few of the bars.

I've been searching for just the right combination of flavors and consistency.  The recipe is what I was looking and the cooking times are right.  Important - let the crust cool some before pouring on the filling - I made the mistake first time of not waiting and it absorbed the filling.  The filling will be very runny after 20 minutes, but don't cook it longer - it will firm as it cools.

No need to search any further for the perfect lemon bar.  I like a lot of filling, so I make half again as much filling and keep the crust recipe the same.  This is the perfect ratio for a wonderfully lemony bar!  Great recipe kukadog!

The crust is too thick and hard. I Used only half amount of all purpose flour and only 1/2 cup of UNSALTED butter (room temperature) with a 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I also used only 1/2 cup of confectioner suger. Bake the crust only until the edges are golden brown. I suggest baking this in a prepared 8 x 8 inch pan.....I used only 1 cup of sugar and a 1/3 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice with 2 eggs and added 2 tablespoons of flour. It typically takes longer than 20 minutes to bake. Mine turned out great with a flakey crust.

Very Good! I forgot to do as one reviewer said and whip the lemon mixture really well right before pouring onto crust. I think it would have made these even better! Also, I might not add the powdered sugar next time since it took away from the tanginess of the lemon.

I gotta say this is indeed a great recipe.  If you're looking for lots of lemon flavor with an almost creamy filling....this is it!  My husband can't get enough.  (P.S., me either).

I have made this recipe twice in one week!  With it being lemon season in California, I am sure it will be a request again!  Made the recipe as is, I don't really care for sweet lemon recipes, but this was a very balanced recipe.

There is no way that picture is accurate.  I used 1 plus an additional 1/2 the filling for my 9x13 inch pan and they are still not that thick.  The crust is too savory for me, not sweet enough.  The filling is perfection with the zest of 2 lemons.  Bake filling at 340 instead of 350 for 30 minutes and it came out perfect!

I just made these for the first time a couple of days ago. I did exactly what the recipe calls for and they turned out great. I would just follow what the recipe says. Also it is very easy and doesn't take a whole lot of time to put together.

So easy and so delicious.  I tried these and the "Best Lemon Bars" and both were delicious.  Only difference is in the crust, this one uses powdered sugar and the other used granular.  I preferred this crust, it seemed smoother. I used about 1 cup of lemon juice and increased the flour by about 1 Tbls.

This recipe was okay. The crust was fine.  There was not enough filling
  Also, for some reason to me the lemon curd was not sweet enough. A good starting point though.

FABULOUS! The shortbread crust was the perfect foundation for an amazing lemon filling (made 1 1/2 times the amount, which was just right)! I would say these are bakery/restaurant quality. My picky eater daughter is gobbling them up and this recipe is now a family favorite.

These are perfect. Made as is, slightly too thick of crust for my taste, I might try halving the crust part next time. Thank you for a great recipe. And in case anyone else wonders (I wasn't sure), when I did the cutting of the butter into the flour/sugar mix, it was not like a pie dough consistency. It was just flour with butter cut into until it was as crumbly as I could get it. But never came together; it always takes ice water for my pie doughs to come, but it didn't call for it, so I didn't do it. I just went ahead and pressed into pan evenly (looked like flour with some crumbly butter). I thought it would be dry, but it wasn't at the end. Worked fairly well. Seemed to not soak the lemon/egg mixture up as other recipes did.

I loved it!  Added 1.5 times filling and it was wayyyyy better.  Better ratio to crust.  You have to extend the cooking time thought.  DO NOT cook crust longer than 15min.  Awesome recipe.  Very lemony

WONDERFUL!  I do suggest making at least 50% more filling, like many reviews suggested, though.  That's what I did, and the filling was just barely enough.  The crust was just right as is.  The lemon filling was sublime.  It was rich, creamy, and lemony tart; not a bland, faintly lemon flavored congealed filling like so many I've had before.  The texture was perfect!  We'll definitely be having these lemon bars time and again at our house.

This is a mouthwatering recipe. I have made it many times and even my husband who claims he doesn't like lemons loves it (granted, he likes the base more than the top). Just thought it might be useful for anyone trying out this recipe for the first time to know that it should be made in a sturdy dish. Something like glass, pirex, etc. If you make it in a disposable pan, the liquid on the top may leek underneeth (still delish, but a bit of a messy business). If you MUST use a disposable, i suggest making sure the sides of the base is tightly patted down, and don't carry it to the oven without it being on a tray. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I made these yesterday morning for a quick and easy dessert.  I served them with a spoonful of cool whip on top and it was so yummy. I needed 4 lemons for the amount of juice I needed 1/2 cup. My sons friend said he has a new favorite dessert. I have now a great treat to bring into work on Mon. Thank you again for another keeper. This will go in my repeat file.

Followed the recipe exactly the first time I made these.  They where to sweet for my taste, so this time I lessened the sugar by 1/2 a cup. Now they are the right tartiness for myself and my family.  Only problem is that they eat them to fast.

After reading other reviews, I was concerned there would be too much crust and not enough filling.  However, I made recipe exactly as written and found it to be a fine ratio.  I thought it could have been more lemony and I like another recipe I made from this site better than this one.  Overall, though, a good recipe that won't disappoint.

Amazing! I made these for the first time to take over to my mother in law's for a family get together. They got rave reviews! I made these and a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which is what they usually request, and these were done first. Everyone asked for the recipe. Definitely a make again! I read reviews of the crust being overwhelming, so I made a half recipe of crust and baked it in a 8 inch pan. Full recipe of filling. I was very concerned, since it was incredibly runny. It baked up in 30 min though, and was great! I forgot the icing sugar on top. Definitely do try this recipe though, and adjust according to your crust/filling ratio preference!

Sooo good! Doubled the lemon topping as suggested and baked for longer...turned out great! Fresh squeezed lemon juice is key.

Make as is the first time (Everyone has a slightly difference preference for sweet to tangy ratio) then adjust as you see fit.  

Its great to begin with though.  I'd like less lemon juice but I think I'm in the minority.

Absolutely Delicious!!!! I read the reviews and did up the lemon to 2/3 lemon juice and actually added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the dough crust. I will make this MANY times again.

I made an error and added the 2 1/4 cup flour towards the crust but I loved how it came out.  I didn't add the lemon zest because I didn't have any but it came out delicious.  It wasn't too sweet or too tangy. Very fast and easy to make, I recommend this recipe to anyone.

These lemon bars are so delicious! They are not either too sweet or too tart...just perfect. Instead of cutting in the butter into the flour for the crust, I creamed the butter and powdered sugar with a paddle attachment in my mixer then slowley added the flour. I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract to the shortbread dough since these days i'm on a almond extract kick. Since I baked this in a glass baking pan I turned down the oven tempature to 325 degrees. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Thank you SO much for posting a long lost recipie I had.  My grown adult children have never stopped asking for this, but as much as I searched through my cookbooks and written recipies, I simply could not find it, and today I see it.  Much thanks from me, and my children and grandchildren [when they get them :]  Also, I'll finally not have to hear from my kids " Remember when Mum used to make..."

Fantastic bottom pastry! I agree about the filling being cut in half. Otherwise, the lemon filling overpowers the pastry bottom and you can't enjoy the bar as a whole.

Really good. I didn't alter the crust, but I added the juice and zest of two lemons and it punched up the flavor. I'm glad I did because I really don't think it would've been as flavorful.

Pretty good lemon bars.  My 2 complaints are that the crust was way too buttery and the lemon layer was too thin.  For next time, I would double the lemon layer and half the amount of butter in the crust.

Wish I could give it 6 stars! Unbelieveable. So good and easy to make. My guests raved about them. I can't wait t have company so I can make them again. I didn't use all the crust but I wanted the lemon filling to be nice and thick. Yummy

I wanted to make these bars for a friends party. Luckly I never just make something then take it someplace the next day. I always give the recipe a shot in case it needs to be improved and what not. THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE for lemon bars I have ever used. They are sweet and tart but not too tarty. The crust just melts in your mouth. :) 

My only suggestion would be to double the filling. If you only make what the recipe calls for you have more crust than filling. Doubling will ensure a well balanced lemon bar. Thanks KUKADOG for a GREAT RECIPE!!!

Delicious! Cut the crust recipe in half for a 9x9 dish, but made all of the filling. They were a hit at my game night party! Couldn't use the zest, b/c I don't have a grater for it, but they were still plenty lemony! Used three juicy lemons. :)

Made these as part of a holiday gift platters. I have a TNT lemon bar recipe, but decided to try this one.  It was very good! I did however make 1 1/2 times the filling as per some reviews and was pleased with the out come.

I made these bars for the first time and followed the recipe exactly, except I forgot to add the flour to the filling, but they still turned out perfectly!  No tweaks needed to this recipe - it's the perfect balance of sweet/tart.

This is the first 'pie crust' type dessert I've ever made from scratch and it was an awesome success! My husband raved! I loved the texture of the crust, slightly crumbly. I did work on pressing the piecrust into the pan to make sure it was an even thickness, but other than that it was easy as, well, pie! The mixing of both the crust and filling I used my kitchen aid mixer. I can't wait to bring this to share with friends!

Made these yesterday without reading all the reviews however I will be making again but with some changes due to the crust was to thick for the pan size suggested. Next time a larger pan for thinner crust of double up on the filling and add a little move lemon flavor. They are good.

I cheated a bit on this recipe since I had a store bought 9-inch deep dish frozen pie crust I wanted to use up.  I prebaked it, and made the filling adding zest from one large lemon.  And since the one lemon didn't quite make a 1/2 cup of juice, I topped it off with Limoncelllo.  Baking time ended up closer to 45 minutes.  It came out so lemony!  Great, quick, & a keeper!

These are the Best Lemon Bars I've ever made!  My search for the best lemon bar is over now.    I followed others suggestions of 1 and a halved the filling but next time I will double the filling.  Great recipe!  Thank you Kukadog!

Followed directions as written.  Wonderful, I won't change in the future- however, I do see that some would want more filling.  It was fine for me and my family!

These were excellent.  I made 1 1/2 times the filling as suggested by others and was the perfect amount.  Incredibly easy when compared to making lemon pie and the same wonderful taste.  They disappeared very quickly at my house.

Better than I have ever had - not too sweet but not too sour either. Definite hit for the workplace.

Excellent! I took advice from others & increased filling by 50%...baked add'l 5 minutes.  Came out exactly 1/2 crust (yummy shortbread like) and 1/2 lemon topping. Good balance. The crust is done at 15 min even if it doesn't look like it. Let it cool before dusting with powdered sugar. Didn't have "real" lemons for zest so added a 1/2 capful of lemon extract. Very lemony! Thanks for the recipe :)

This is my favorite lemon bar recipe. I like really thick filling  so I half the crust and 1 1/2 the filling.  To make it light and fluffy I mix the filling until frothy.  To keep them from sticking I spray the pan with non-stick spray right before I pour in the filling.   I love these they are so good and so easy.

Being a lemon lover I choose this recipe I was tired of the usual lemon-bar recipe there was just not enough lemon. These where the bomb!  I doubled the pie part and I brought them to our Growing Families potluck this past weekend and they where nearly gone within an hour!! Thank you for this recipe I will use it from now on I love them!

These are the BEST lemon bars.  Consistency for the filling is perfect with a nice lemon flavor.  The crust is awesome and doesn't over power the filling.  I've tried a few other reciepes on this site for these bars and although they are good...this one is the best (IMO).  Thanks for sharing!

These are very good.  Very lemony and the crust is more like a shortbread cookie, not a pie crust.  Yummy.

I took these to school today and the Lunch ladies gave them rave reviews. I used lime juice from my tree. I also used a dry cake mix for the crust, I was out of confectioners  sugar. Really yummy, will make them again. Thank You Kukadog :)

If you do prefer filling to crust, you may want to make increase the amount of filling for this recipe.  I made it the listed way the first time and, upon reading reviews, made 1.5x the amount of filling the second time.  To me that was perfect, because when I made them a third time I found that 2x the filling was too much.  Regardless, the flavors are there and these bars are so yummy. In addition to the fresh lemon juice I add a bit of store-bought because it (ironically enough) gives the bars a stronger lemon flavor.

What an awesome recipe!  I absolutely LOVED it!  It was exactly what I was looking for in a lemon bar.  I made 1 1/2 times the filling as recommended by tat2whttrsh aka Lambchop's Mom after reading a discussion regarding lemon bars on the RE. I loved the filling so next time I might even double it for more gooey goodness!

This was easy to make and made a lot. I would have given it 5 stars, my husband and daughter chose 4 stars. The edges got slightly too dark with the suggested baking time, so I think next time I will reduce the oven temperature slightly. Thanks!

I don't know what happened, but my bars were too lemony.  Almost bitter.  I had to throw them out. They also didn't set up as well they were almost runny.  I followed the recipe exactly. No changes. Maybe my lemons were just not good.

YES! 5 stars BUT 1 1/2 times the filling... doubling is a little thick but one and half times is perfect. Do not overbake crust and make sure crust is well blended before patting into pan.  Use freshest lemons you can find and use a micrograter for the zest... make sure you use as much as called for in recipe if you really like lemon bars... this is an awesome recipe!

I loved this recipe! Would've given it five stars but I made a change to the recipe just by doubling the amount of the filling, otherwise the crust would've been a bit much for me. Cooked for a bit longer than suggested, came out chewy, perfect and delicious!!

I agree with another reviewer that the crust was way too thick.  We also did not like the texture of the lemon on top.  I thought I did something wrong the first time so I made it again.  Sorry but I had the same results.  Will not be making again.

My family really likes these. I have made them several times, and whenever I 
get lemons from friends this is the first thing that I think of. The crust is very 
nice and flaky, like a pie crust should be.

Good classic recipe for lemon bars, the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the crust to lemon curd ratio was off (too much crust). Next time I will adjust it, make a little less crust and it will be perfect.

I read the reviews that it was "crust heavy", so I made 1 1/2 of the filling. Just for fun, I mixed half lemon juice / half orange juice. It's tangy & sweet!

Yummmm! Nice and tart. I halved the recipe, baked it in an 8x8, added 1 extra tsp. of zest, half of which I put into the crust. I baked the crust for 25 mins and the filling for 20.5 mins. Next time I would cook the crust for maybe 1 min less, although it is still amazing. Thanks!

Don’t make it according to the video. They don’t follow the directions for the ingredients or add the sugar. Otherwise these are simple and delicious.

OH MY GOSH! Fantastic flavor and the crust is delicious. This is over of those recipes I used to be afraid of but thanks to All Recipes I have become somewhat of a mad scientist in the kitchen and fear nothing!

This is a fairly easy recipe to make and is popular with my group.  I've made it several times and have added a few things.  I use a 9" x 9" pan (lined with foil for easy clean up).  I add 1 tsp vanilla to the crust mixture.  I also add 1 to 2 tsp of lemon extract and the zest from the whole lemon to the filling.  The 9"x9" changes the dimensions, so it takes longer to cook (20 minutes to set the crust, then another 30 to 35 minutes to set the filling).

Very good! I used 1-1/2 times the amount of filling. Will double it next time. I used 1 stick of butter & 1 stick of margarine for the crust.

I've never made lemon bars before and these were super easy to make! They turned out delicious! I actually ate one still warm, lol. I'm going to let cool to room temp and then put them in the fridge over night. I'll have some happy co-workers tomorrow :)

I would give it 4.5 stars if I could; it's delicious and wonderful but needs a few tweaks. I didn't think the filling-to-crust ratio was quite right, so when i make this again, I will use less crust and the same amount of filling. I also had to bake the crust a bit longer than suggested to get it to brown, so I would suggest 20-25 min rather than 15-20.  But it really is lovely and I will definitely keep this as my go-to for the next time I get a generous donation of lemons from my friends' trees!

I've made this recipie for  a couple of years. It's perfect. Just add more zest according to your taste. My oven cooks hot so I turn it down 25 degrees. Leave it the way it is. You won't regret it

I halved the recipe (8x8 pan) and it came out perfect. Real Butter shortbread crust is so easy to make after you let the butter soften naturally. Giving them for Christmas gifts and the leftovers I gave to my co-workers and Raves all around!

These were very good. I followed the advice of another reviewer and increased the filling amount by half while keeping the crust amount the same. This worked out very well for us. This definitely would have been a five star recipe if it had been submitted with the increased filling amount.

I made this tonight. Here is my opinion. I agree with the others, the crust is too thick, so next time I will double the filling. The filling was great, just not much of it compared to the crust. I also used butter, which I am not a fan of, I hate the taste of real butter, so next time I will use margarine. I also add a few squeezes more of the lemon juice in the filling than originally called for. Other than that they came out great, I was just not a fan of how the crust tasted made with butter.

Really good! The crust needs to be baked about 20 minutes I found. I did tweak it slightly. I added 1.5 tablespoons lemon extract and 1 tablespoon of vanilla both to the filling. It definitely made a difference. Loved it!

I kept the pastry the same, and made one and a half times the custard. Cooked 20 minutes and came out set.  They taste great even straight out the oven; will put them in the fridge though as I think that might make them even better.

I thought this was so easy to follow...I loved it!  I followed exactly as stated, but cut it down in 1/2 b/c I didn't want to make so many bars.  I thought it could have used a more lemony flavor so as previous comments mentioned....add more zest next time, but not more lemons as 1 person stated b/c it will make the mixture runny...my husband liked them...so yea!  Also, I think I'll try a smaller pan...i think mine was too big making the filling spread out too thin...

These were so good!  Just like lemon pie on a short bread crust...wonderful, made a large pan so there was lots to share.  Everyone loved them, and they looked so pretty, and cut cleanly!
I tried another recipe and it did not compare to this one!  This is the keeper!

Yum, yum!  I did what others suggested and used 1 1/2 times the ingredients for the filling.  You could easily go with 2x the ingredients.  On one batch I used equal amounts of lemons and limes (rinds and juice) and I think it might have been better than just the lemon bars.  Also, don't dust with powdered sugar until right before serving.  This is 5 stars with the filling amount increased!

Best,easiest lemon bars I've ever made. I'm enjoying one as I type. Next time I make them, I'm going to spread the shortbread thinner and make 1 1/2 times the amount of filling as a reviewer suggested. This is just a personal preference and they are wonderful as baked according to the directions. Thank you for a real winner dessert!

I had never made lemon bars of any kind and had been craving lemon dessert and decided on this recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made 1-1/2 times the amount of filling. I'm glad I did because it was the perfect amount. I followed the rest of the recipe as written and jiggled the pan and touched the center of the filling to make sure it was set. It seemed to be after the 20 minutes the recipe states. Not thinking about me increasing the amount of filling I didn't think to bake for additional time. They could have used a few more minutes to firm up just a tad more but they were great. We couldn't eat just one. Thanks so much for the great recipe. It's one I'll keep and make again!

This is THE simplest recipe I've found for lemon pie bars. I honestly never tried one until this recipe, and now I'm hooked (as well as my friends)! I tweaked it a bit and used fresh lemon juice from 3 good medium lemons, and then used the full zest of one lemon. It balances the sweetness from the sugar and is not too tangy. After reading other reviews, to prevent the bars from being too soft, I baked it all together at 25 minutes (rather than 20). Just check it in the oven around minute 22 so check that the edges don't burn.

As other reviewers suggested, I made 1.5X the amount of lemon topping, but these still came out thin... limp would be a good word, and the lemon topping had this awkward spongy texture.  I made these hoping to give some of the squares as a thank you gift, but I would be too embarrassed to give them away.  I made lemon bars years ago, and now I am riffling through old boxes trying to find the recipe, because this was was very disappointing.  I did like the texture of the crust and it was very easy to make.

These are absolutely delicious, and so easy to make. I did have to bake the crust quite a bit longer than 15-20 minutes, but that's fine because it smelled so incredibly good.

I thought the crust and filling were perfectly balanced. Not too tart, not too sweet.

I'm hooked, I will make these over and over and over again.

I absolutely loved this recipe! It was quick and easy, and it tastes superb! I'm gluten-free, so I used gluten-free all-purpose flour from Fred Meyers, using the same amounts as instructed. Also, I used Earth Balance butter instead of real butter in the same ratios. I cooked it at 350F just a little longer than 20 minutes, but I do have an old oven. I didn't wait till it turned golden brown, except barely along the edges, due to its gluten-free nature. It turned out flaky, light, and deliciously moist to where it melted in my mouth! I used fructose as my white sugar substitute, and used 2 1/2 fresh squeezed lemon to have more of a fresh and tangy taste. I don't usually follow everything to the letter, so I used rough measurements and it still came out wonderful. I didn't even wait for it to cool before I ate a sample! :D I should use this more often!

I did as others suggested and doubled the filling. A little sweet in my estimation could cut the sugar a little. Also, liked these better the next day! Really would rate a 3 1/2 star.

These were a big hit.  Shared a few with the neighbor; she took one bite and said "Mmm, this crust is to die for!".  Am certainly adding this to our dessert rotation.

This recipe is all right but, in my opinion too sweet of a crust, and it needed more lemons if you are going to use a sweet crust like that. But, I personally like my lemon bars a more zesty instead of sweet.

This is a very good recipe.  I did go with a 50% increase on the filling due to personal preference.  Yum!  The crust is excellent and simple.  The group I shared it with gave it two thumbs up.  I actually forgot to add in the last bit of flour to help the middle set, but this was a forgiving recipe and still tasted great.  Thank you for sharing.

I had never made lemon bars before, but I read some of the reviews before starting. I did 150% of the filling and left the crust recipe the same. THEY ARE DEVINE! And quite lovely, if I do say so myself. Great recipe!

good -  added 1 teas. baking powder to batter right before pouring over hot crust to see if I could get a little more fluff to the "pie" part - worked well.  These were a hit at the BBQ

Note that the flour is divided (unfortunately I didn't until too late and ended up with too much in the crust).  Good consistency, flavor, and texture. Will make again.

Ok. I have to admit that a few days ago, I had never heard of lemon bars. I looked up a recipe, to make for a friend of mine. Needless to say, this is my first attempt to make them. I usually start off first time doing the recipe just as given and then next time modifying according to my taste (if needed). However, based on these reviews I went ahead and made 1.5 amount of the filling. It took me 5 lemons to get enough lemon juice. I even added 2 limes. 
 I baked the crust for 15 minutes and with the filling about 22 minutes. If anything, I found that there should of been just an inch more of the crust dough. It took me awhile and effort to cover the whole 9x13 pan.
Even though, I'm more of a chocolate person, I liked the taste of these. With 5 lemons and 2 limes, it surely came out lemony enough. Very good. I will make it again. 
 I'd suggest to let it cool down completely, before you cut it, if the sharp clean edges are important to you (for presentation). Also, based on the photos, I noticed that people might not know that you should shift the powdered sugar on top of these-once it's completely cooled. 
 I'd recommend it!

very good. My family and I have only had commercial made lemon bars. I made the recipe as it states. Very tasteful. I like it more tangy, i like the sour lemon taste. But this is a great recipe.

I had  little trouble with the recepie since I have a convection oven, but the results were very good.  It passed the evil desert test by my hoarde which is a very good thing indeed.  It will be added to the coffee shop menu!

Had some lemons to use up, and I'm glad I chose this recipe.  Mixed the cookie base in the food processor.  Wouldn't change a thing, luscious and lemony!

I thought the crust was too bland, maybe needed a little salt or something. The lemon filling however was just right.

baked as directed but added a bit more lemon zest.  Still not lemony enough.  They were okay, I still ate 'em, but I've had better.

I followed the recipe exact with one exception; based on a suggestion by another user I made 1 1/2 the amount of filling. We love tart and tangy treats! But this simply did not provide me with the lemony taste I was looking for. I used plenty of zest and even a little Niellson-Massey citron extract....still doesnt have the lemony flavor I seek. I will make this again however, I think I may try a variation of citrus to achieve the taste I crave. Maybe I'll use meyer lemons next (I LOVE THOSE!) Thanks for such a simple recipe!

Good lemon flavor but I found the ratio of crust to lemon too heavy on the crust and not thick enough on the lemon layer.

kukadog, 

Best lemon bars I have ever had! Just the right amount of lemon tang without being to sweet. The lemon topping is moist and cookie crust perfect. They were a raging hit at work and to think I almost passed them up. So grateful I didnt! Thank you for sharing what I know will be a family favorite for many years to come.

Okay so I just made these things today...had a craving for Lemon Bars (and it's been years since I had them).  I was leary about it not being tart enough for my liking.  SURPRISE it was!  The filling was awesome. I didn't have a grater to get the lemon zest so I just kind of scraped the lemon with a knife to get the zest, lol.  My own screw up I guess was when I was baking the crust, it came out the perfect color...it was brown...more like a light tan color...but when I grabbed a slice, it was burnt at the bottom which I didn't understand why.  Still edible and delicious though...definitely will make again but when making the crust, I won't leave it in there for 15 minutes.

I pulled out this dusty recipie today, and thought I would give it a shot since its been a while since anyone has posted that they have tried it. We got a bag of lemons from a neighbor the other day so I thought this would be a good use since it calls for a bit more lemon juice than most recipies. it does however produce a lot more crust than I anticipated, and I had to add some tea spoons of cold water tothe cough to get it to replicate the same consistency of Pie dough. The filling was yummy thought! I liked the Lemon Zest too! these bars have a wonderful balance of tang and sweetness. Delicious!

I would first like to thank you for providing the recipe because I have been aching for something that is sweet but also has some lemon aspect to it. While my bars are baking in the oven, I have to say that I did double the filling part of the recipe because I do like a lot of lemon and I figured why not? This is my first time baking lemon bars so I have to say that while I was making them, I tasted them and found it to be delicious. The directions were very easy to follow and I just hope that they come out as good as they look. Again, thank you so much for helping this novice baker. :)

These are great! I followed the recipe but doubled the filling and I think that is key because the crust is so rich. I also like a more tart bar so I used 1 1/4 cup of lemon juice and lots of zest and cut down a bit on the sugar! Absolutely the best!

Good recipe to make an old favorite.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla to the crust just because that is how I also make shortbread.  I used 1.5 times the called for quantities for the filling and beat until frothy to get a nice light crust over the top of the bar.

My family loved the bars.  They are a wonderfully mild lemon with a perfect amount of sweet to balance.  I don't usually care for lemon bars, but I had trouble not eating them all.

If you love lemon, you can't go wrong with these bars!  Easy and quick to make and the sweet and sour combined with the shortbread crust is a great combo.  As others have commented, I would definitely double the filling to match the thickness of the crust, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  It's a keeper.

I made a few adjustments to the recipe and it turned out great! I used the juice of 3 lemons so I doubled the amount for the filling but left the crust the same amount. I also used the zest of 2 whole lemons and cut the sugar in HALF! I personally love the citrus taste so like that they were perfect, very tangy and lemony and not too sweet. I also sprinkled some coconut flakes on top during baking and it was delicious!

I had to deduct a star because without these adjustments it would have been much too sweet and too much crust for me.

*Really* good lemon bars. They were a huge hit with everyone. Based on other reviews and my personal taste, I made 1 1/2 times the amount of filling, but otherwise made no changes. I had to bake them a bit longer (once the filling was on top) than it suggests, but I'm not sure if that's my oven or the additional filling as I tend to have to bake things a bit longer with the oven in our current house. They turned out extremely well, and were enjoyed by all. I will say that you need a good zester for this recipe; my good one went missing in our last move and this recipe is a bit of a pain if your zester isn't that great. So as soon as the new one I ordered arrived, I will definitely be making these again! It's a great use for lemons you might have around the house.

I've been baking for years, and I have a favorite recipe whenever I make lemon bars; however, this time I decided I would try a different recipe. These lemon bars are, by far, the best I have ever eaten! They're easy and scrumptious!

Nice fresh lemon flavor to these bars.  Very quick to make and they cut beautifully.  Great dessert to take to a gathering or to be enjoyed at home.  Kukadog - thanks for sharing.

The filling was great, but the crust was a little bland and soggy.  I've seen much better recipes before.

This is a recipe that nearly matches that of my Grandmother.  I added and additional Tbsp of flour, 1 egg, 1/4 C. lemon juice and 1 Tbsp. lemon zest.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  The butter in the crust is unsalted.  The result is light, refreshing, tangy and lightly sweet.

We loved this recipe!! I did use more zest and fresh lemon juice,we thought it was a great lemon flavor!! I did use a smaller pan bc I have a 9x13,but we thought the crust-filling ratio was fine. Will make again!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and my family thought they were fantastic.  A nice mix of tangy and sweet, a very mellow recipe.  I have gotten many recipes from this site, but this one was really a pleasant surprise--so much so that I created an account to leave this comment.  Quick and easy and delicious!  I will definitely add these to my go-to collection.

They tasted ok, but looked terrible.  Not sure where I went wrong, but I won't be making them again.  The crust rose too much and was way too thick, and it didn't cook evenly even with foil on top so the crust burned before the filling set.  Very disappointed because the picture looked so nice.

Does anyone have any experience using egg substitute and homemade powdered sugar?  I really wanted these and I'm making them now, but it's been a strange experience.  My shortbread puffed up A LOT and when I poured the egg-free version of the lemon filling on it, it broke the top of the shortbread and kind of sunk half way in....I'm not very hopeful, and will post how they come out.  Any pointers for future substitutions would be helpful :)

update:  they came out like lemon mush with strange flavor.  the recipe made correctly is wonderful, and I have learned my substitute lesson

After reading some reviews, I had decided to 1.5 times the filling and keep the crust the way it is.  These were amazingly delicious.  I have tried different lemon bar recipes but always found them to be too strong of egg flavors or something else, not lemony enough for me.  These are perfect.  I will be making this over and over again.  Now, only if I can stop myself from eating more than one bar at a time...

This is a delightful recipe that makes you feel like spring is around the corner in the middle of a January snow storm.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly but, I doubled the filling, and used cold butter in the shortbread crust.  The bars were cooked for 32 minutes.  Seriously AMAZING!  This is my new lemon bar recipe.  Give it a whirl.  Easy, and delicious!

So so good!  How many times have I made these?? I followed what naples34102 did, one and a half times on the filling. Then when I was telling the old man about them I realized that I used too much lemon juice, I did 1 cup, but they still came out ok. Very lemony!!!  He,(the old man) said they were the best I'd ever made. Yummy!

Yum!! These were amazing, I made a few changes, doubling the filling. With the doubled filling it was about half filling half shortbread.. not too sweet but not too tart. The Lemon Zest really really helps =) I will def make again!

Minority rating here-shocking. We didn't care for these AT ALL! VERY lemony-TOO lemony(sour) & the cosistency of the lemon is really.... gel-like. They stuck to the pan horribly. A disaster for me. Sorry:(

At first I thought the amount of lemon juice was a bit much, but the pucker power is tempered with the eggs and sugar...made as is and will continue to do so!

These turned out very well!  I took the advice of several reviewers and increased the amount of filling by half.  Went out on a limb and further increased both the juice and zest (using juice and zest from five lemons).  Very nice sweet/tart combination ... texture was perfect.

These were divine. I wasn't sure if I was going to like them, but I loved them...too much! lol I cut the crust recipe in half (only because I didn't have enough eggs to double the filling). Next time I will leave the crust as is and double the filling.

Very Simple, followed the recipe except I didn't have any fresh lemons to add rind. I add the a dash of lemon extract instead, turned out perfect.

yummy!  My teenagers requests these often!  Since we like thicker filling I do the filling 1 1/2 times the recipe.  Perfection!

Loved them! But here's how I tweaked the recipe based on other reviews: for the crust I followed the original recipe.  It didn't mention whether or not to grease the pan, so I did anyway, which I'm glad I did because the crust tended to stick on the sides.  For the filling: 6 eggs, 2 1/4c sugar, 6 tbsp flour, 3/4c lemon juice, rind of 1 lemon.  I baked it for 25 mins, then made sure it was cool before I sprinkled the powder sugar. The crust and the filling were proportionate and tasted great! If you don't want it too be real sweet, maybe cut the sugar down to 2c instead.  I also thought they got better the longer they were in the fridge.  Lemon bars are my fav and this recipe was sooo simple and tasted sooo good.

Perfect!  I took the advice of a couple other reviewers and made 1 1/2 times of filling because we prefer more.  The flavor was outstanding and the crust was the perfect balance.  I found the baking time to be right on.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made these just as directed.  They are very good.  All who ate them liked them as well.  I asked my hubby if he thought they needed more filling, since others said they had too much crust and/or not enough filling, and he said no, they were great just the way they are, don't change a thing.  I have made them twice now and getting ready to make them again for Super Bowl refreshments.  Thanks for the great recipe, kukadog!

These were good. I made 1 and 1/2 the filling. It definitely needs at least this much maybe even double so it is in proportion to the crust. I also put a bit less butter and the crust was very buttery in taste. I would probably add more lemon for a bit more tartness, but they are good as is. (Oh- I used egg beaters to save on calories and I couldn't tell the difference with the texture or taste.)

I doubled the filling, and it was super delicious!!   I was nervous about the crust, because I've never made one, but it came out just fine. I didn't have a pastry cutter, so I had to combine the ingredients by pinching them together. I also forgot to add the flour to the filling. I used the lemon juice from a plastic lemon and didn't add zest, but everything worked out perfect.   The thing that I love about this recipe is that i have all of the ingredients [minus lemon juice] right in my pantry!

I love to bake, but this was my 1st time ever making Lemon Bars. Found this recipe, pic looked beautiful, sounded easy to make, and the reviews were really good. I have to say they were really delicious, along with myself, my husband and other family members really enjoyed them! Very nice lemon flavor, and I am a huge lemon fan. I too like others made 1 1/2 recipes of the lemon filling and it tured out perfect. Extremely easy to make and perfect for a Spring/Summer dessert, thanks :o)

I thought this recipe was great.  I made it just as the recipe indicated.  The only thing I didn't add was the Lemon Zest.  I only had lemon juice....they still turned out great.  I thought it was just the right amount of crust and just the right amount of lemon.  We will definately make these again.  Thank You

Really yummy bars! Next time I make them I'm going to add more lemon filling and cook it a bit longer. Also, if you add the powder sugar, add when the bars are completely cooled and just before serving, but the sugar does make them a bit too sweet. Making them again for sure!

The lemon filling of these lemon bars is amazing just as it is in the recipe.  I used fresh lemons for mine, and wow!  The the only thing I will change next time is the crust. It was bit too crumbly. Also it is very important not to over cook it. I cooked until just a little brown, but that was too long. Next time I will use a 1 2/3 cups of flour, and only cook until just the edges are a little brown.  All in all the is a great and easy recipe. I will certainly make these again!!

These are good. Easy to make. I used lime zest for a different twist. It is a good idea NOT to sprinkle with powdered sugar until just before serving.

I thought there was too much dough and not enough filling.  it took a lot longer to cook than 20 minutes.  The filling tasted perfect though!  next time I will use a large pan and double the filling.  My pan was empty in 24 hours.  Thank you for the recipe!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars because it was very good except that for some reason I was expecting it to be just a tad tangy-er. Must be because of a different recipe that I had tried before. I will use this recipe again but I think I will increase the lemon juice by a quarter of a cup. That should kick things up a notch. Thanks!

One of the yummiest lemon bars I've tasted and incredibly easy to make!  The only draw back is the appearance.  The top stays a little soft.. after you sprinkle the powered sugar on top, it just dissolves into the bar.  If you can overlook that, these are a definite crowd pleaser.  If you find a way to firm up the top and keep the flaver, please share!

I made these bars and followed the recipe to the letter.  They taste very good, but the top had deep cracks...like an earthquake.  And for a 9 x 13-inch pan, the lemon mixture isn't nearly enough.  It's not as thick as the picture leads one to believe.  I'm glad I wasn't making them for company.

These are without a doubt the best lemon bars I have ever made!  I have a Meyer lemon tree here in AZ and I am sure that helps to make them good but I have tried other recipes and nothing compares.

This was the first time I have made lemon bars.  I have to say that the custard was AMAZING!  It was more than I expected.  However, the thing that kept me from rating it a 5 star was the crust. Being the first time making it and only once before tasting it, it seemed the crust was doughy, not crispier like I thought it would be.  However it looked like the picture so maybe I was expecting the wrong thing.  I will continue to use the recipe and enjoy it.

Multiply this filling, and it would make a great pie! As the other reviews said; too much cookie crust. I would suggest rolling the crust with a pin to less than 1/4", then place in a quarter-sheet pan, making a good dough rim. Double the filling mix, and pour in til deep.

Simple and perfect...living in California lemons growing in my yard.  Delicious....Easy to make for Church and friends and family gathering...at the drop of a dime.  All the ingredients are  always at hand...most people in my circle have never had a lemon bar....we are used to peach cobblers and such!

Lemony but lacked a degree of satisfaction.  The crust was dry and the filling wasn't as tart as I'd hoped despite adding a wee bit extra lemon zest.

This is a great recipe! These lemon bars are just the right amount of sweet and tangy. I’ve made these a few times and this time I made 1 1/2 times the filling as other people recommended and they did not come out as good. They taste fine but it’s too much filling. I’ll be sticking with the original recipe again. Thanks!

I was going to make this for a project for my class, but then when i made it, it turned out horrible! I had to put it in for  3 times the time it said. When it came out my father came in and said the top looked like slime. Thanks for such a horrible recipe.

I made these when I was at home bored one day and they went like hot cakes. I brought some to work and left some at home and everyone loved them. I would definitely say that you could safely reduce the amount of sugar in them because they are incredibly sweet. They turned out exactly as they should have without any complications or hiccups.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe as is and it came out great. The second time I made it, I used a mixture of ponderosa lemons, meyer lemons, and lime. The flavor was more complex. The third time I doubled the custard, added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1tbsp of lemon zest into the crust, also double the lemon custard, and it had a right balance of custard and crust for us. So...I’d say just experience with whatever limes/lemon you have and be surprised. We do like the combination of limes and lemons. It didn’t taste like a traditional lemon bar, but it was more fun.

Very good! I have made this many times following the recipe perfectly  and its as always wonderful. I do have to agree with one of the reviews that they are not pretty. But who cares if you just plan on vegging out in the recliner with a plate full?
Today I read all of the reviews and followed some advice, 1.5 times for the filling, they are very pretty and very yummy, so yes they are perfect any way that you make them... YUMMM! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

One of my favourite recipes! Always works really well and guests love it as a little treat! I add a little more butter to the crust to make it moister and easier to get out of the pan.

this is intense.  I added extra lemon zest and doubled the topping amounts.  great but maybe a bit too intense. cut smal pieces. to half I added a layer of seedless raspberry jam between the lemon and crust. I preferred the bars with the jam but they were still great either way.  next time try 1.5 times lemon layer instead of double. the jam layer adds color and looks great. I skipped the icing sugar

These are DIVINE!!  The crust is thick but so tasty.  The lemon layer is tart but sweet.  I might make 1.5 times the lemon next time, just because I love it so, but these turned out great following the recipe.

Just like other reviews (that I read after making) the pan size in the recipe is too large. I'd also suggest an 8x11 instead. I had to make 1/2 of the lemmon, eggs and sugar filling again just to be able to cover the crust.

I made no changes to this receipe and  I found the crust to thick and the lemon mixture to thin. 
I would half the crust ingredients. The crust and filling were good but I think I should stick to my lemon pies they always turn out great.

I made this recipe for the first time and it is delicious! I will definitely be making this again. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and increased the lemon filling 1 1/2. It was the perfect ratio of crust to filling. This is a must try!!

Made it exactly as written and it came out nicely but not as lemony as I expected.  I will be making it again but will increase the lemon zest or perhaps add a small amount of lemon oil to pump up the pucker !

I did not make any changes in the recipe.  However the crust was very dry and not at all flaky.  I would make a different crust next time.  The filling was delicious!

I followed this recipe to the letter, except for the final step. First, the crust didn’t brown in 15 mins. or in 20 mins or even in 30 mins, but that’s when I stopped baking it. At least the bottom of the crust was browned. The lemony topping was extremely thin using the recommended 9x13 pan, whereas the accompanying recipe pictures showed that layer to be nearly 1/2 inch thick. Where I did differ from the recipe is at the end. Instead of dusting the lemon bars with sugar, I topped them with a layer of dark chocolate. While the finished bars were tasty, they were not thick enough or lemony enough. If I make this again I will double the lemony layer.

I am not a rookie baker, but when I compose a recipe and 1 particular ingredient is used for 2 different purposes I usually put a comma at the end and the word "divided" that way people know not to add that one ingredient into one mixture because if a recipe is composed properly you don't need to read the directions just the bake time and temp. Thank goodness that 1/4C of flour isn't that big of a deal and keep the measurements the same as written in the ingredients (i.e. 1/4C not 4T = to 1/4C) for beginners because that could also be confusing unless you have a measurement sheet.
Also the video that is connected with this particular recipe can't even match up to it due to the confusion. If anyone has watched it.

I followed the other reviewers tips to increase the filling by 1/2, kept the crust as is in the recipe except for adding 1/2 cup flaxseed so I could feel a little healthy ??. The bars came out fabulous! Love it! 5 stars!

I made these even after reading the bad reviews. My crust took much longer to bake and I added more lemon juice and less sugar. Just the way I like it. Tart. It did take 20 mins to finish baking it but at least 30 mins for the crust. The filling looked a little skimpy so maybe I would increase the filling the next time by half as much but overall, pretty good. Filling baked up perfectly.

It was really good! I made half of the recipe to test it out (and because I had a much shallower pan), but the timing worked out perfectly and fortunately, nothing was under/overcooked. Next time I might add a bit more sugar/add icing on top for a bit more sweetness, but overall I loved the crust and it was very nice!

Everyone loved these! I read some of the reviews (positive and negative). Decided to make the crust as directed. Was so easy. Bar cookie crusts are sometimes hard to spread completely in the pan. I love lemon, so I made 1 1/2 times the lemon filling. That was perfect for the crust. My filling took longer to set up because there was more. Just kept checking on it. The bars came out of the pan looking beautiful and tasting great!

Made as written except for the addition of 1 tsp lemon extract. Took 15 minutes for crust to bake and an addittional 15 minutes for lemon curd to set. Bars turned out moist and delicious. Not overly sweet or too strong of a lemon flavor. I would make again, perhaps adding some chopped pecans to the crust to enhance flavor. This one is a keeper!

Worst dessert ever made.  There is barely any lemon in it, maybe 1/4 inch if that.  Picture is ridiculous making you think it's thick like a pie.  Never again.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times over the past few years. It always earns rave reviews. I follow the recipe exactly in terms of ratios, etc. Perhaps I use a bit more lemon zest....I do highly recommend mixing the crust in the food processor--it makes the work so easy. 
Absolutely fabulous recipe--my go-to for when I need to bring something to a party or pot luck.

Best lemon squares I've ever had, and easiest I've ever made.  An easy five star for me!   I bake the crust on the lower end of 15-20 mins but otherwise, the recipe is true.

I brought the crust up the sides of the pan.  The directions didn't specify to just line the bottom of the pan.  Besides, I thought that the filling would stick to the sides of the pan.
Anyhow, it is quite delicious and the next time I make it, I will just line the bottom of the pan with the crust.

I just had to leave a second review! These bars are so divine the recipe should have been kept a family secret and sold! I have made these bars 3 times, I can't keep up with requests for more! I noticed many people either wanted thicker crust or more filling. I use an &x8 pan & they are absolutely scrumptious! Thank you again for sharing this recipe! Award winning in my book!

Could have been better. I agree with other reviews in that the custard should be doubled. (Personal preference)  This was my first time trying this recipe next time I'll double custard and only cook crust for 15 minutes. This recipe was pretty easy to make.

Wish I had read the reviews first and Im glad I tasted the batter before pouring it in so that I could adjust it. As written it is Way too sweet for my taste. Lemon bars should be lemony!  Made the crust crumbly by using half cold butter, half coconut oil, and pulsing in my food processor. I pressed the crust into a pan and baked for 15 minutes. Took it out while still pale, as suggested by other reviewers. I used 4 eggs, 1/4 cup full fat greek yogurt, zest and juice of two large lemons, 1.5 cups white sugar, and 4 tablespoons of flour.

I thought these lemon bars were amazing. I added a little more lemon juice and zest for a little more tartness but a really good recipe. I've made these about 5x now and each time is more amazing than the first.

I don't know how to make pie crust or what the "consistency" should be so didn't know how much to mix the base or how to put it into the pan. Also should it be greased or ungreased pan? How do you know if the lemon is done enough? Not really beginner-friendly instructions. BUT tastes great even if it's falling apart while I eat it.

I've made these bars at least a half dozen times.  First couple of times I used lime juice as I was out of lemon.  Either way these bars turned out excellent!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  Glad that they can be put into the freezer as company just loves them when they come over for coffee.

The crust to filling ration was a little too much for me but the recipe is delicious. I put a basic sugar glaze over mine and then were amazing.

I read the reviews about too much crust and not enough filling, and I LOVE filling.  So I spread the crust in one 8 X 11 pan and one 6 X 8  pan. Then I doubled the filling - and they turned out amazing! I will make it again - with double the filling and spreading the crust thinner. It looked like the picture - it was perfect. 

I am fortunate and have a lemon tree in the backyard and laying hens.  This recipe was amazing.  I also tried it and made a lime version.

This is one of those recipes you make and then eat it and say "I can't believe something this good came out of my kitchen."

I look forward to making it again.

It was an easy recipe; make it again. The change that I made was... I added several handfuls of ripe blueberries on top of the lemon before I baked it.

I made no changes, completely disregarding the reviews and thought I'd figure it out on my own. I have some regrets! Like previously stated numerous times, the crust is a bit thicker than I'd like and in return takes away from the great taste of the filling. Nonetheless they came out nice and I will be using this recipe again in the future(of course I'll listen to the reviews next time as well.) one question and the only real reason I gave this recipe 4 stars is because of the frothy film that hardened when baked and made a crispy crust on top of the filling. Is that supposed to happen? I didn't really care for that... But still yummy!!!

It's a classic... I baked the shortbread crust with unsalted butter, so I added 1/2 tsp salt and baked for fifteen minutes. I also did 1.5 times in the lemon topping. Seemed like the right proportions to me. Tart, lemony and five stars!

I will make this again and again and again--when I am mentally strong enough to eat in moderation. These are so addicting; I loved the texture, the taste, and the experience of baking them. And the CRUST!!! I followed the directions step by step.

I've been making this recipe for years! I alway make 1 1/2 times the filling. And it is perfect! 
The lemon zest adds wonderful flavour to this bar and also using butter is very important to the taste!
Thanks for posting this recipe, I often make it for work showers, going away Teas and people always comment on how good they are!
Hint* No Margarine!!!  USE BUTTER!!!  And fresh Squeezed lemon Juice!!

Made it as is a solid 3. By adding the zest and juice of 1 additional lemon makes it a 4. Tastes even better the following day.

This is only my second time making any sort of lemon bars, and I thought this one was delicious.  I shared them at a church gathering, and even people who typically don't care for lemon desserts commented on how much they liked these.  Make no substitutions in this recipe, and definitely use fresh-squeezed lemon juice!  A real pleaser for any warm-weather gathering.

Easy recipe to follow.  I add a little bit of orange zest and orange juice from freshly squeezed oranges in addition to the lemon.  I  personally think the crust to filling ratio is off so I make more of the filling. Other than that I love this recipe!

Loved the tangy lemon flavor! Substituted the lemon zest with a tsp of lemon extract because I had it on hand. Will make it again this way

Delicious! Personally, I didn't find them too sweet or too tart. As most people have suggested, increasing the filling's a great idea unless you like your lemons squares to be half crust and half filling. 

I used 1.5x the regular amount of filling:
6 eggs 
2 1/4 cups of granulated sugar
3/4 cups of lemon juice
2 lemons worth of zest, adjust to how lemony you want your bars to taste

I also added 1 tbsp of dried thyme to the crust, but I'm sure they would have tasted just fine without!

This recipe was really fun and simple to make. I made it twice, and both times it came out really good! My suggestion would be to not cook it too long. Just until it gets to a pudding consistency. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe! I would suggest using the zest of the whole lemon as it makes it taste great. If you're worried about the filling to crust ratio, you can either cut the crust in half and use a 8x8 pan or double the filling.

If I'd have known how easy lemon bars were to make, I would have tried them long ago! This  is a really good, basic recipe. Has that *classic* lemon bar goodness. I added a pinch of salt to the shortbread dough though, because the last shortbread I made tasted flat. A tiny amount of salt did the trick.

I make this for my family all the time, I double the filling and it is a hit. My husband is stationed in Afghanistan and I have to send him 3-4 batches every couple of months, 1 batch for him and the rest for the crew he is with. He said they don't even make it back to his living quarters and they all want to know when the next shipment if coming!

I loved these!!! They are perfect for if you are over all those chocolate deserts! I doubled the filling because the crust looked like a lot. I also baked it at 340 instead of 350. I will definitely make these again!

This recipe Is for individuals who love tart lemony desserts!  I think it is fantastic!!!  As per other suggestions I made 1 1/2 times the filling. This made the perfect amount for the delicious base.  Thanks for this lip puckering recipe!

I made these yesterday and they are very good. We are cutting back on sugar, so I did substitute 1/2 Stevia for 1/2 of the sugar in the lemon mixture. I followed others advice and increased the lemon zest and they are nice and tangy. My husband loves lemon bars, so I'll definitely make them again.

I doubled the lemon zest because I love the lemon flavor it adds. Scrumptious!

I love these bars and make them every month or so.  Some may find the pastry layer too thick or filling layer too thin but I love them as they are.  They are also easy to take along for sharing and get snapped up quickly.

Absolutely loved them, what's more my grown children loved them!  I did cut the recipe in half because I wanted a smaller portion.  Worked for me in an 8x8" pan.

Delicious!  And very creamy for lemon bars.  I read through several reviews remarking on the amount of crust to filling, so I kept the crust to the same amount but doubled the filling.  Glad I did, as it is a lot of crust.  I also cut back on the sugar, using a 1/2 cup less.  I like them even more tart, so I might add either more lemon juice or zest next time.  Since I doubled the filling, I had to cook another 17 minutes.  All in all, though hit that we all enjoyed as a treat after a bbq.

I think these turned out pretty well. I followed some other comments and doubled the ingredients for the filing. I did find the crust to be a bit too sweet, so I'm not going to use as much sugar next time.

Made these yesterday, followed the recipe and they came out great. I did use the wrong pan and used a 9x9 instead of a 9x13 I think this made the cust to thick and my kids agreed but I will make these again and again but will thin the crust by using the right size pan.

Try number 2, the lemon-fill at the beginning looked the same both times. Just trying to make sure I measured the full amounts of ingredient to make the filling was upsetting. (Hey, having the first lemon-fill trial finish the bake-time & not solidify was really hard!)

I thought I would lower the temperature of the oven by 10 degrees and cook it 15 mins longer.  Ta Da... fresh Lemon Pie Bars!!!

I run the lemons through a juicer.  No juicing and making lemon zest, it is done all at once and makes a very lemony taste.  Also, for a light summer dessert, put some blueberries ontop of a slice and a little whip cream...it is very nice for a summer dessert.

Good tart lemon bars.  I have made a couple of changes; split the crust recipe in half and use a square 9 x 9 pan.  The crust tastes like shortcake, which I love.  Make sure they are completely cooled before you sprinkle the confectioners sugar.  Neither the original recipe, no my changes 32. These are a big hit at home and with the neighbors. They are pretty close to the ones Starbucks use to sell a good while back.

oh. my. gosh. I couldn't stay OUT of these I must have ate more then the rest of my family combine! I doubled the filling recipe though, and instead of the lemon zest I added about a tablespoon lemon extract and they were the right amount of lemony. They were the best lemon bars ive ever had they were SO good!

Holymoly- these are great! I needed to use up a bunch of lemon juice so I pretty much doubled the filling. I cooked the crust for 15 minutes and the filling for 25. Perfect. Not too sweet, very tangy. Beautiful.

Meh. It wasn't lemony enough for me; based on others' reviews, I added zest of three lemons & it still wasn't lemony enough. Although the crust tasted good, it was waaaay too thick. Try another recipe.

Mine didn't turn out so well, so I probably didn't do it right. They were really flakey and fell apart so I added a 1/4 packet of gelatin to make it more chewy. I liked the amount of lemon, but I actually just cooked the pie once and then cooked the lemon topping in another pan and spread it on the "pie" afterward. It tasted ok both ways, but better once I modified it to my liking. Suggestion: Make it the recipe way first but then modify to your likings the second time you make them. Don't give up if they don't turn out right the first time. Practice makes perfect!

Second time making these as I was craving them again. I'm mostly a "fancy" dessert lover, but these lemon bars hit the spot if you are wanting a good, old-fashioned treat. Try them refrigerated and serve with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and raspberries!

I was disappointed in this recipe. There wasn't enough filling for the amount of crust, making the bars very thin. My crust turned out crumbly which made them difficult to get out of the pan. I followed the original recipe exactly.  I would not make these again.

Took the advice of others who thought the filling was a bit skimpy, and made 1-1/2X the filling recipe. Thus, only four stars.  Unfortunately, I did not bring the edges of the crust up high enough to accomodate the extra filling, and had about a custard cupfull more than I could use.  But in the finished product was nearly as thick as a lemon meringue pie - which was great.

The filling was awesome, with a nice tart lemony zing, without any changes - and we all found we couldn't eat "just one." I will definitely make this one again - thanks for posting it! :)

I made these bars for my church's coffee hour after service last Sunday (April 14th) and everybody loved them!  I received many requests for the recipe, which doesn't happen very often.  These bars are exceptionally good, just like lemon meringue pie without the meringue and cut into squares rather than pie slices.  
Thank you very much for sharing!

These are pretty good.  I increased the filling by 50%.  As a result, I wasn't exactly sure how long to cook the bars.  I may need to tweak the cooking time a bit.

The taste of these was wonderful - just what I was hoping for. A word of advice though - when making the crust, next time I might put waxed paper to line the pan, or just grease the bottom of the pan because it was difficult to get the first few squares out. It worked out for me because my husband and I enjoyed the less-than-perfect looking squares, while we gave the others to my parents for Easter. Will definitely be making again!

The first time i made this, i followed the recipe exactly. The first time came out too tart and tangy for me and too sticky/runny. However, the 2nd time i made it, i tweaked a few things. I left the lemon juice at 1/2C but added 1/4C orange juice and orange zest from one orange. I decreased the Sugar to 1C. and substituted 1C corn syrup. I didnt have butter on hand, so i used margarine. The second batch came out WONDERFUL and Amazingly delicious! I'm going to keep making my "citrus" bars with the above guidelines! =]

These were good, I really loved the lemon flavor!  I took the advice of other reviewers and made 1.5 times the filling.  Even with the extra filling, I thought there was still a lot of crust compared to the filling.  Next time I will either double the filling or half the crust recipe.  I didn't have fresh lemons, so I used bottled organic lemon juice and an equal substitution of lemon extract for the lemon zest... perfect sweet/tart lemon taste!

After years of searching I have finally found "the Lemon Square" recipe I had been longing for. These were perfect. I took reviewers advice and doubled the filling and tweaked measurements a bit. Sooo good. Even my hubby who said he doesn't like lemons squares ate 4 of them!

These were absolutely delicious and so very very easy. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I read the comments and made 1 1/2 times the filling and that was just right. I accidentally doubled the lemon juice, though, so they were quite tart, but not in a bad way. Everybody loved them. Even my 5 year old daughter.
I also didn't have quite enough butter so I used about 50g of Coconut Oil in the base. Will definitely make them again.

Sounded really good and super easy, but the dough part was way too thick compared to the lemon topping, and it tasted like butter-logged flour (and I love butter) Literally,it was so greasy tasting I felt like I was eating a stick of butter...on another note, the topping was awesome, I used fresh squeezed lemons and that part was super good, and set nicely. I suggest trying to find a better bottom mixture!

Wonderful exactly as written!  My only suggestion is to use backyard lemons if you have access, preferably Meyers.  The juice is much better than store bought lemons give you.

Great flavor.  I increased the filling to 1.5 what was called for and thought it was the right amount.  I then baked the filling for 28 minutes to get the top to set.  I was surprised that the filling was still gooey and more like custard/pudding, but it was good.  Will make again.

Pretty good.  I didn't have any lemon zest so I left that out.  Personally I didn't care for the pie crust, but all in all still pretty good!

If it hadn't been for my little oven that doesn't quite work right, I'm sure I would have had the perfect lemon bars. The flavor was just what I was expecting and the preparation was not hard. My oven, however, caused it to look weird but again, the taste was great.

I love these Lemon Bars. They are the best I have eaten and made. I like the thick crust and cooked mine in a little water bath. It helped stop the crust from over cooking. I have made these many times and even people who aren't sure about the whole Lemon tast, I tell them it is sweet, delicious and different if your're tired of chocolate, cookies, cake, ect. Not one person has said they didn't like!

These were PERFECT!  I love the thicker crust.  And it's easy to adjust the tart/sweetness of the lemon filling.  I will make this again! (Updated: I have made this again and again over the years  - still my favorite!)

I will NEVER use another lemon bar recipe in my life.  OMG - this is THE BOMB and this is coming from a bunch of lemon bar snobs.  I have made these 3x in 2 days with requests.  This recipe even got be a catering job booked based on how good these were.  Thank you!

This was the first time I made lemon bars and it was really good.  I loved the crust.  The filling was lemony but not too bad.  The only thing I would do is double the filling because it came out really thin but other than that it was really good.

I love this recipe! This is the only lemon squares I make since I've started making them. I always double the filling as per others suggestions and keep the crust the same. I also like to whip the filling until it's frothy. Everyone in my household loves it! I made this to bring to a ladies tea party ~ hopefully the reaction is the same :) the smell is amazing when I'm making. Lemons smell so clean and remind me summer!

These were just OK. Followed the Recipie to the letter pretty much. I dont know, I just was not impressed. Had too much of an egg flavor when they were all done.

WOW!! These were awesome! I made them for a family dinner last night and everybody is still raving about them! It was quite a process making them as everything seemed to be going wrong, but it was worth it.  My dough really was hand made as the only way I could get the butter to mix with the flour/confectioner's sugar combo was to get in there and mix it with my hands! I'm terrible with crusts, but everything turned out great.  I can't wait to make it again :)

these were great. I took a suggestion and thinking I would like more filling 1/2'd it again. I think we would have liked them just as written better, but I rate them 5 since that was my recipe change and they were delicious either way.

This recipe was soooo easy and super tasty. Everyone loved them though I will say I accidentally put 1 cup of lemon juice in my mix instead of the 1/2 cup. Luckily everyone didn't seem to mind. Yummmm :))

This was the first time I made lemon bars. I found the crust to be a bit on the thick side. The filling was sweet and tart, the way it's suppose to be. I followed the recipe exactly as described, no changes. I would make this again if someone requested it for a special occasion.

these were great! i was really tempted to take others' advice and double the filling but since i was low on eggs and i always like to try a recipe the original way first, i did it exactly as written and i'm glad i did. i loved the ratio of crust to filling. it was about even, 1:1. so if you like more filling, just make more filling.

I left the crust recipe as is but made 1.5 times the filling.  I used a mix of lemon and lime juice (mainly lime) and no zest, just because I didn't feel like it.  Delicious!  So so so delicious.

These were really good.  I was surprised that I got 1/2 c of lemon juice out of 2 large lemons.  Also surprising for me was the crust.  It is completely a powder when you press it into the pan.  Since the recipe compared it to pie dough I was expected a solid dough.  It turned out just fine though. I made it in my food processor and poured the lumpy powder into the pan and pressed it down. I did have a bake 5 minutes longer for the lemon layer to set up.    I made the recipe exactly as written and I thought the about of short bread to lemon was very good.  I will make again and keep it this way and not a thicker lemon layer as some have preferred

I thought these tasted great. The other comments about the crust being like a shortbread are right on, but it wasn't a bad thing. I could have eaten the whole tray!!

I did like most reviewers and made one and half times the filling. I added 1/2 cup plus of shredded coconut to the filling which really added to the taste....I don't generally like coconut, but was awsome in this.

my butter wasn't necessarily softened.. i pulled it straight out of the fridge and nuked it for a bit.. 16 minutes left it a lil underbaked.. next time its going it for 20.. lol.. because of that the first bite tasted like flour and lemon.. but after i chilled it in the fridge it was fine.. that was was my mistake.. but this recipe is great.. first time i made lemon bars from scratch.. delicious.. not too sweet, not too tart.. a great balance.. VERY simple to make, great for summer parties (beach!!) and i will b making more of these soon!!! thanks so much!!

I would give 4 1/2 stars!  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to make the recipe as originally posted and tweak it the next time round, if needed. I thought it came out great for the first time making it!   Next time I will add a bit more lemon to it (I like it tangy)...and bake the crust maybe 5 more minutes than called for.  If you like 1/2 crust, 1/2 lemon topping, make the original recipe.  If you like more lemon topping and less crust, I would suggest, as others have, to increase the ingredients for the topping.

after cutting into squares and keeping in the fridge all night, they set up nicely and have a good flavor.  i was afraid the filling wouldnt balance out the amount of crust, but they're just about right.

These were wonderful! My friend in AZ sent me some beautiful lemons from her tree (I live in MI) so I thought I would make something lemony. They turned out great, everyone gobbled them up! I wouldn't change the recipe at all.

I made these for a family reunion yesterday. they were a hit! I chose to make 1 1/2 times the filling as others had suggested. If you do this, don't forget to increase the baking time by 5-10 minutes. I also added about 1/8 teaspoon lemon extract to give them more of a zing. Make sure to use real lemons for the juice and the zest! I highly recommend these, so easy and oh so good.

My family loves these Lemon Pie Bars!  My kids would eat them all in one sitting if I let them!  I've made them a few times and I follow the recipe exactly!  They turn out delicious looking with the powered sugar on top!  Thanks so much for sharing this, it is definitely a family favorite in this house!

I made these as Lime Pie Bars (rather than lemon) three days ago, and they are even better than the first day I made them.  The bars have more flavor after sitting for a day or two.  I used bottled Key Lime Juice (found at your local grocery store), and left out using lime zest because I didn't have a lime.  I made no other changes.  They are fantastic, and my family loved them!  I will definitely make these again.

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  I used the juice of 2 lemons to make the 1/2 cup of lemon juice required. I found them to be very lemony and sweet at the same time.  Although my husband and I enjoyed the kids were not interested.

Just made these, and I was a little apprehensive since it was a true "from scratch" recipe, crust and all, but it was amazingly simple and the bars taste great!  Some people have commented that they aren't lemony enough.  I think they have quite a bit of tartness to them, I squeezed lemons to get the juice and I used the zest as called for.  Wondering if some might be using bottled juice and/or skipping the zest and maybe that is affecting the tartness?  Anyway, worth the effort.

Great flavor and taste, but I must have done something wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the lemon filling ended up being on the bottom and crust was on top.  Will try again.

These are delicious! I made these exactly according to the recipe, with one exception. I forgot to add the flour to the filling! But they were STILL awesome!!! LOL :D I also got the sort of scum/foam on top, and it doesn't affect the taste, but for aesthetic reasons you can dust with the icing sugar and then it doesn't show. I also used golden caster sugar instead of white.

I did 1.5 times for the filling and regular amount of crust; glad I did. Taste was great for both brust and bars. However, the top of my bars got a weird texture on them. Like after I beat the mixture together there was a foam on top and it sort of stayed that way. I couldn't tell when I was eating them though. I am not sure if that is normal? Could be just me.

Tart & sweet and very good with the buttery crust! I also chose to use 1-1/2 times the filling for the same amount of crust. They came out delicious!

This is a tasty and easy recipe. I cut the recipe in half so I could use a smaller pan but even so the shortbread crust took about 30 min to turn brown. I like my lemon bars a bit tarter so next time I would add in a couple more tbs. of lemon juice.  Over all though, everyone at my picnic loved them!

Maybe I failed but I followed the recipe very carefully and found the crust too thick, the filling too heavy but the meringue was delicious. I wouldn't make it again. I wanted something lighter like Lemon Meringue Pie.

Great and tasty!  I did not use as much zest as called for, I think 1 tablespoon is too much.  I also made some high altitude changes others may find helpful.  I live at 9300 feet.  I increased the oven temp to 375 degrees and baked the crust a few minutes longer till it was nice and brown.  I added 1 tsp additional flour to the egg mixture and 1 TSB additional lemon juice.  These turned out tart and lovely, I will make them again.

Very Very tasty!  Also, very easy to make.  I followed directions exactly, and the only change was to bake a bit longer than suggested once the filling was added.  Give it a try!

super delicious!  there are only two things i would change.....first, i added three lemons worth of juice instead of 2 (i skipped the rind) and second, next time i will cut the crust back by half--it was good, just a little too much for my taste.

If you like the crust than this recipe is for you. I personally like the lemon on top and it wasn't very lemony even though I added an additional 1 tsp of lemon extract and there was barely enough filling to cover my crust. I will try again and cut the crust in half because it was good, just too much.

I thought these were pretty good, my only complaint is I thought they had a bit of a strong egg flavor.  I would still make these again though.  My dad absolutely loved them... which is saying something because lemon bars are definitely not his thing!

These were wonderful-be sure to cook them until the filling sets.  I had to cook the crust much longer than ten minutes, but it all turned out great.  Thanks!

Until I find something better I'll continue to use this recipe.  It was just fine, and with twice the lemon of the other recipes I imagine it must be superior, as I certainly wouldn't want less lemon juice.  However, somehow it just isn't quite what I had in mind.  Everyone loved them, though, and the entire pan was gobbled up quickly by adults and kids alike.

I just made these for the first time and they came out fine. Next time I'll just bake the crust for a shorter time as my oven uses hot air and tends to dry things out quickly. The filling is fabulous! Thanks!
