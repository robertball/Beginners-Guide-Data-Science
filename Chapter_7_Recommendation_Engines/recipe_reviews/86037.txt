I thought these were great!  After reading the other reviews I only made one small change in that I used less butter than called for, and instead of using little pats, I melted in first, tossed the seasonings in with the butter, and drizzled it on top of the fries before baking.  It turned out perfectly.  Nothing was soggy or greasy, and the fries crisped up beautifully.

These were very good. I personally like a lot of spice in my food. When I was making this it occurred to me that there was a LOT of seasoning going over the fries. However, you have to remember that heat will actually "kill" some of the flavor so it is not as bad as you think. My whole family really liked this. I only used 1 tablespoon of red pepper and some of the family still thought it was a little hot. Personally i didnt think so. I will be making these again. Very nice flavor. Just tweak the "heat" to your own liking.

1/4 cup butter is too much - the fries were swimming in oil.  I would use 2 tbsp. and up the temp. to 450 degrees - I left them in the oven for almost an hour to crisp them at 425, but have to watch so nothing burns.  The taste was great tho and even better the next day when I could make them really crispy. Make sure they are spread in one layer too.

I read through the reviews before I made these. I didn't end up using butter, I used only a tablespoon or so of extra virgin olive oil (it's a little heart healthier) and because my kids were eating these, I cut the red pepper spice back to one teaspoon. I didn't cook my fries in a casserole dish, I layered foil over a baking sheet and baked them on the foil. I also used steak fries. My husband really liked these but my kids didn't care for them much at all. I had one and thought it was tasty. I served this with my homemade fry sauce that paired well, though it was quite a kick combined with the spices from the fries.

To quote my daughter, "oh, man, these fries are so good".  I used steak fries because that is what I had and use a little less red pepper flakes for my kids' sake.  These are really good, and we were fighting over who got the last few!

The seasonings were soooooo great!!!  I have to agree with others that the butter listed is way too much, so if making again I would decrease that tremendously.  I baked these at 450 for about 35 minutes and then broiled them for another 7 or so to get them crunchified.  Loved 'em - my thanks goes out to the firehouse!

Amazing fries!!! I made it exactly the way the recipe listed, except that I drizzled the butter, and it was loaded with flavor! If you want the max flavor, don't skimp on the spices or butter!

Very Good! I didn't have any red pepper much to my dismay so I used Fajita seasoning instead. I will make these again!

FIVE STARS for sure....my husband & I made these one night as a side for dinner...it was the two of us, my brother and law and our 15 month old....they were a HUGE hit....they were super spicy but the lemon pepper really balanced it out.  We made sure to give our 15 month old fires w/o too much of the seasonings on them...but she did LOVE the few that we gave her.  This will definately be a repeat in our home :)

Although I love to try new recipes from this site, I seldom write reviews and have never written anything negative.  However, I felt it was necessary to write about this one.  I'm a huge fan of anything hot/spicy and was excited about trying these fries.  I followed the ingredient amounts exactly but used 3 tbsp of olive oil instead of the butter (at the suggestion of other reviews).  I placed everything in a large ziploc bag and tossed to evenly coat the potatoes.  They smelled great while baking, but I was SO disappointed!  The spices seemed to overwhelm each other, resulting in just alot of "hot" but not much flavor.  I'm not sure what I would change if I try them again but something just wasn't "right" for me.  Maybe less red pepper would make the lemon pepper more distinctive.  I tried dipping them in ketchup or Ranch dressing and still didn't enjoy them.

These were delicious! I cut the amount of red pepper flakes in half and they were still very spicy. They tasted great dipped in fry sauce and ketchup, yum!

We really didn't like these.........I used fresh russets and sliced into steak fries....baked with olive oil....I guess we basically just used the recipe for the seasoning..not the method.....Didn't love the lemon pepper.......Like it on fish..but not fries.

The flavors did not blend well! The lemon pepper was too much and I used only 1 1/2 tbsp! I also used only 1 tsp crushed red pepper, 2 tbsp butter and was still not impressed! To modify a recipe as much as I did, is not worth keeping!

I didn't care for the lemon pepper in this but the rest was perfect. Spicy yes but good. They were simple to throw together to go with my burgers. Thanks!

oh these are sooo yummy! I cut back on the butter (it seemed like it would be a lot) but I kept the rest of the spices the same.  My father whole family loved these fries, and my mother, for the first time ever, asked ME for a recipe.  If you LOVE spicy food this is definitely the way to make fries.  Thanks!

Wowzers! The fire alarm was going off!!!! These are HOT! Instead of using frozen fries, I just diced and peeled potatoes. I melted the butter and added the spices to that and poured it over the potatoes and mixed it so they were all evenly covered. I baked at the given temp for 30 minutes. I cut the seasonings in half just due to availability but with the amount of potatoes I used (5 small ones) it worked perfect! They didn't get 'crunchy' like a french fry so maybe next time I will actually try the fries!

Watching the Crosstown Classics with my White Sox playing the Cubs today, I was in total junk food mode. Chips, salsa, hot dogs...and now, french fries. I love french fries, and I love spice. This recipe had my name written all over it. Being a "struggling" college kid, I had Ore-Ida Extra Crispy Easy Fries on hand, so I sprinkled the seasonings on the fries, and popped those babies in the microwave. 4 minutes later, I had a nice batch of spicy, spicy fries, which I dipped in sour cream on the side. Great idea, EMTCARO2, thank you!

A great use for frozen fries.  I chose to use steak fries and they worked great with this recipe.  This recipe has been in my recipe box since May 2011, and I'm glad I finally got around to trying this recipe.  I served them with 'Idaho Fry Sauce' from AR and we also had 'Bagel and Cheese Bake' from AR.  A good all around meal that I would make again.

These were pretty tasty fries. I did follow the other reviews and only used two tablespoons of butter and drizzled it over the top of the fries.  I think that was plenty to make them nice and cripsy.  Of course, I cut down on the red pepper seasoning because we don't like things too spicy.  I didn't use as much lemon pepper, because I'm not a fan, but I think next time I will try it with the full amount.  These had a nice balance of flavors and they will definitely be made again in my house.

These were excellent. I used olive oil instead of butter, and only 2 tbls instead of 1/4 cup. With much chagrin, I didn't have any lemon pepper, so I had to leave it out.  I cut the dried red pepper in half so the kids wouldn't bawl, and although  I was worried, they gobbled them up.

I was hoping for flavorful spicy fries but these turned out to only be way too SPICY and I only used half the crushed red peppers.  Not a recipe that I will be keeping for future use.

This is great!  I made these fries with garlic pepper instead of lemon pepper and added a tablespoon of salt.  I rubbed the steak fries with olive oil instead of butter, then poured on the seasoning and baked them for 30 min.  Soooooo good!!!!

These were really good, and simple too! I didn't measure any of the spices, just srinkled them on ( I wasn't sure if the recipe was calling for red pepper flakes, or cayenne pepper, because I don't know what red pepper seasoning is, so I just used some of both). Also, I was short on butter, so I just drizzled on some olive oil (maybe couple of tablespoons), and tossed them around before putting them in the oven. I baked mine longer than 15 mins., maybe more like 20-25, turning 1/2 way through. They came out perfectly crispy and spicy! I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

It is what it's name says it is. He or she didn't lie. I used cayenne pepper, 1 TBLS. [I had it on hand] Was worried it might be to hot for my son, but he said he liked them. I used 'shoestring' F.F, I think a thicker one would work better. Have lots of ketchup and soda on hand, your gonna need it.

Pretty tasty! I made a few changes to the recipe... I didn't have any lemon pepper, but I probably missed out on the best spice in the recipe by omitting it! I sprinkled on the rest of the seasonings instead of following the exact directions. I also - sparingly - used spray butter instead of butter pats, and the fries were still a little soft. I layered them on a baking sheet and cooked at 425 degrees for 16 minutes. If I would have cooked longer, I'm sure they would have been crunchier. Either way, I really liked the taste!

Waaaaay too spicy for me, but Husband liked them well enough. The only thing I did differently was to increase the amount of garlic powder. The lemon pepper was a nice touch. Thanks!

This is the best french fry recipe I have came across. We love spicy foods, and this fits in as a nice surprise to everyone.

Oh good lord, this recipe did /not/ go well. First, since I was on a kick of trying to use up things in my house, I thought I would make fries from potatoes. Then, I had to figure out how many potatoes would be in a bag. I figured 5? Hmmm. So it didn't look like very much, so I put half the amount of spices in, 1 tbl lemon pepper, 1 of the crushed red pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt and garlic powder. I totally forgot the chili pepper and black pepper (did it really need more after all of the pepper in the lemon pepper?). So, I baked it for 30 minutes covered in a casserole pan to get the potatoes cooked. Then I uncovered it and baked another 30 turning a few times. The result? They looked good, smelled good, but too dang spicy to enjoy! I ate them--albeit with about 1/2 cup of ff sour cream to dip them in. Next time I'll either quadruple the amounts of potato or cut down on the red pepper flakes!

Good blend of seasonings.  I am not sure the butter is necessary though, considering the extra calories it piles on.

My son liked these, he gave them a thumbs up. I did not use butter, instead I sprayed the cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray, they where a little dry. Next time I will use the butter, and see if that helps.

This came out good.  My fries didn't get as crispy as we would have liked (and I left them in there for a good half hour), but the taste was good.  Thanks!

This was a nice twist to oridinary frozen fries.  I added all the seasonings except omitted the chili powder, and added only one tablespoon of lemon pepper, and one tablespoon of onion powder. I mixed all the spices in a small bowl and sprinkled it over the fries.  Though this makes alot of seasoning and I only used half the bowl and it was still very spicy.
