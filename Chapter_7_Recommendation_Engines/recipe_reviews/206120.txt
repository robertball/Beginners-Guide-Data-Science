This was delicious! I cut up an onion and two cloves of fresh garlic which I added to the cabbage and 1/2 stick of butter. When the noodles were done, I added a tablespoon of butter to the noodles before adding them to the cabbage mixture. I will make this again and maybe cut up a small ham steak to add a little meat to this dish. Thank you for the recipe!

Great easy recipe, I fried the cabbage and onions together for well over 30 minutes and then added the cooked noodles for another 30 minutes.  Tasted just like the cabbage and noodles cooked by the "church ladies" at the summer picnics

The very definition of comfort food!!! Sometimes I'll back off the butter (just a little) and make up the difference with olive oil.  A little bit of smoked sausage in with cabbage really works too as a main course.

This is very similar to an old family recipe minus a few extra steps that I think really bump this dish from just okay to something more special(deserving of five stars): Add up to a teaspoon of dried FENNEL SEEDS(think predominant flavor in italian sausage) and a teaspoon of SUGAR to the melted butter. The sugar allows for bits of cabbage to get slightly caramelized. I always cooks the noodles al dente and add them to the cabbage to get a little caramelized themselves.  Often times I add some chopped LEEK, ONION, or colored PEPPERS if I have them on hand. Adding some purple cabbage really enhances the visual appeal of the dish. If I have them, I also prefer using spaetzle noodles or fresh frozen egg noodles (chewier consistency). Lastly, a sprinkle of freshly grated PARMESAN on top adds a nice little extra and a bit of protein.  Oh, and I never use even half a stick of butter for this amount of cabbage and noodles and I don't miss it. Keeps the fat to a minimum.

My dad was a Marine who spent a good bit of time in Germany. He fixed this a lot when I was a child and this recipe was the perfect recreation of those memories. A wonderful, tasty, and above all else SIMPLE dish.

this was delicious! i made some changes to turn this into a yummy dinner. i fried up some sliced kielbasa, diced onions and minced garlic. i set that aside and cooked the cabbage in the same pan. my suggestion would be to fry the cabbage in batches so that it browns easier. i also think i will use a little less butter next time. thanks for sharing this recipe!

I honestly have to say this is a very good dish. I would give my version only 4 stars though because I used margirine and a little less than they recommend. Even my children ate it and they are very picky. My daughter didn't want to try it but once she did (she's 6) she ate it all and even asked for seconds!!! That wins in my book!

I grew up with this dish!  We used to sprinkle a small amount of caraway seed into the cabbage when it was at the end of it's cooking time.  Comfort Food!

My grandma used to make something similar to this...but we would use macaroni instead and also sprinkle parmesan cheese on top when it was done.  Sounds weird but really good, just dont add salt, only pepper and parmesan. you must fry in butter, oil is NOT the same

This was so simple and very good. Excellent side dish for the herbed pork roast on this site. Totally reminds me of something Oma would make. The only thing I would do differently is make 1/2 the amount, we had 4 adults and one kid eat this as a side dish and I have a large tupperware left.

I try to eat lower sodium due to high blood pressure and when you use no salt butter and don't add any extra salt, this is a very low sodium dish that is also very flavorful. I was surprised that I liked this so much. I never would have thought of this combination of foods. This was very simple and fast. I added an onion and some garlic and I cooked the cabbage for about 20 minutes like others suggested. I used 3 Tbs. butter and 2-3 Tbs olive oil to cut back on the saturated fat. This change along with using whole wheat egg noodles in place of regular helps me feel better about eating this dish. Next time I will add more sweet onions and cabbage and less noodles. Thanks for the recipe Judi.

I have 3 college age sons and a fourth in high school. Those 4 guys along with my husband means I need to double the recipe. To make it simple I put the butter and onion in a deep roasting pan in the oven at 350 degrees. When the onions start to brown alittle I add the cabbage. I stir it about every 20 minutes until I get it to the point we like it. I then add the buttermilk biscuit "noodles" to it that I make. Heat those through and all done! No need to salt this dish because I boil the noodles I make in chicken broth. That along with  the buttermilk biscuit dough has enough salt added already.

This recipe, exactly, is how my family has been making it for years.  A friend of mine makes it as a side dish, but for my family it is a meal all by itself.  My favorite thing is that this heats up wonderfully in the microwave.

I have been trying to cook interesting meals for vegetarian sister for years.  Who knew something as simple as noodles, cabbage, and butter would be her favorite!  She constantly asks me to make this for her.  Thanks for making her (and me!) happy!

This was pretty tasty! I don't think my pan was big enough though, the cabbage never really browned because there was so much butter! Once I combined the noodles and cabbage/onions ( I added 1 sweet onion) I did add about 2 T more butter and let it melt in. I also added garlic salt. YUM!

I made this exactly as written, it was delicious!  Next time I will back off the butter a little bit and will use garlic salt.  It would probably be fantastic with chopped ham or sausage, although it's already pretty rich so in that case I would cut way back on the butter.  Will definitely make this again!

I read the recipe to hubby and thought wow, wouldn't that be great with our pork roast tonight?  But we didn't have cabbage..... so we improvised with frozen brussel sprouts in butter sauce, added carmalized onions, and lots of fresh cracked black pepper.  It turned out great, and next time I will try the recipe with real cabbage (not baby cabbages) and maybe add a little sour cream instead of the browned onions, because they made it all little TOO rich.

I am not familiar with too many German dishes, and found this a little bland. I used onion and garlic as another reviewer suggested. Will definately try again, I love all the ingredients, but will probably add Paprika or the like.

Delicious!  I made the recipie as is and we loved it.  I used half of a giant head of cabbage, but I wouldn't consider that a modification. Next time I think I will play with the proportions and use half of the noodles and brown them twice as long like one person suggested.

Add a pound of chopped, browned bacon to this and you have Halushki, a Slovak staple! Actually if you use the bacon, you don't need the butter, just fry the onions and cabbage in the bacon fat.

My guests loved this recipe.  The only thing I added was a peeled diced honey crisp apple at the end.  Oh, and I used a bag of slaw that had carrots in it too.  My man loved it too.

Just a wonderful recipe.  I sprinkle a little garlic powder while frying the cabbage.   It just adds a little something to yet a very good recipe.

Don't make this if you aren't absolutely crazy about cooked cabbage.  I had my hopes too high for my kids liking this.  Fine if you for sure like cooked cabbage, doubt we will make this again though. Did make as directed.

Adequate!  Much better if you fry a pound of bacon.  Remove bacon and place on paper towel.  Fry shredded cabbage in bacon grease until browned.  Mix cooked egg noodles well with cabbage.  Crumble and mix in bacon.  Add freshly ground pepper to taste.  This is the way Hungarians make this.  KIDS LOVE IT!  Big kids, too.

Yummy!  Thanks for this recipe, my son has asked for fried cabbage for years and I was finally able to make it.  And it was delicious!  I served with beef kielbasa that I cooked separately.

This is really yummy!!  I remember my Oma feeding me stuff like this when I was a little kid.  It's like comfort food.  It may seem a little bland to some people, but I think it's delicious just the way it is!  My fiance was concerned that it didn't have any meat in it, so I sliced up a summer sausage in there.  He really liked it!  I would use Kielbasa if I had it on hand.  Anyways, thanks for a great recipe!  Will make this again for sure.

Love it!  Ate this since I was a kid.  I now use the egg noodle recipe from this site with it or frozen gnocchi.  Really good and a cheap, satisfying meal.  Great for pot lucks too.  We love it when the cabbage turns brownish..mmmmm

I've made this for years, family loves it..
I prefer my Homemade Egg Noodles to bought noodles.  Also, I add some grn. pepper, onions, at times.
 Caraway seeds added the last 5-10 minutes of cooking..
If you cook the Cabbage too long, it gets mushy !!!

I love dishes like this that have survived literally hundreds of years, with just tiny little changes in the spice or herb depending on what part of Europe you came from, my grandmother from Croatia added a little garlic, in the Nordic countries a bit of Caraway was sprinkled on, I've had it in Ireland with a hand full of minced green onion but always with home made noodles which absorb the flavors better than dried and always with unsalted butter. Americans use salted.  I fix this basic recipe at least twice monthly and always add something different to it depending on where I want to travel in my mind. :-)

Super yummy!  I fried up some onions and garlic in the butter before adding the cabbage.  Also added a couple torn up leaves of kale, some Worcestershire sauce and red wine vinegar.  Then at the very end added some sun dried tomatoes.  Mmmmm.  Both the husband and baby loved it!

This was an okay dish. Definitely nothing to write home about. It's probably good if you have kids, because it's so basic and not complex.  Maybe something I would make again for a quick week night meal, but that's about it. I used the no-yolk egg noodles and half a stick of butter... a whole one would have made it really greasy and fattening! We had to doctor it up with other spices... I added garlic salt and seasoned rice vinegar, my husband added chili garlic sauce and the vinegar. Easy, quick and very simple... just a little too simple for us! :)

This is DELISH!! I started with homemade spicy sausage that I sauteed with a whole red onion thinly sliced..until the onion was soft..then I added the cabbage and stick of butter..and finally the al-detente noodles..a sprinkling of garlic salt and coarse black pepper to finish it off to taste.. SO SUPER YUMMY.. If I close my eyes ..it kind of reminds me of Chow Mein.. call me crazy..but this is the epitome of comfort food.. YUMMO!!

I have made this several times and every bit of it is gone when I do.  No leftovers.  I love this recipe and I would never have thought of putting these 2 together.  I also like to add a few dashes of Tabasco sauced.  Delicious.  Thanks for posting this.

Very good recipe.  I also added a sliced onion to the cabbage and butter and added a generous amount of garlic salt and fresh cracked black pepper.    I eyeballed the noodle quantity and only used about half of a 16 oz. package.  Went wonderfully with the Baked Terriyaki Chicken from this site.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Was worried to try it but it's great. I added chopped up garlic, shallots and fried bacon for some meat. Instead of adding salt, I used soy sauce and little bit of sesame oil. My kids loved it. Thanks!

I made it almost as is, but I just had to add a little bit of bacon.  I fried up half pound of bacon, drained all but the brown bits and then added about 3/4 stick of butter.  I cooked  both the cabbage and noodles a little longer than the recipe called for, stirred in the bacon and served.  DS loved it as much as I did (DH wasn't in the mood - more for us!!!).  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

The first time I made it I found it bland, but I decided to make it again and modify the recipe.  So I added thinly sliced onions and grated carrots to the cabbage.  I sautéed the veggies with caraway seed for about 5 minutes in butter and then added about 1/4 C chicken stock, covered the pan and simmered for about 5 minutes.  I removed the lid and raised the temperature to reduce the liquid and brown the veggies lightly.  Then I added the noodles and some leftover Octoberfest sausages and sautéed until the sausages were heated through.

This doesn't have half the flavor as making it with some bacon and frying an onion in it.

i made this, and then found the recipe. i add onion and garlic with whatever leftover meat i have, if it doesn't have garlic and onions it is probably dessert. though i make a couple desserts that have them in it.

We've made this dish in my family for generations.  Two things I would add to the recipe 2 garnishes 
1. 5-7 strips of fried bacon (crumbled on top after all is cooked and ready to plate) **Reserve the bacon fat add a little butter and use this skillet to fry your cabbage in.  This adds a lot of flavor 
2.Before serving top with a dollop of sour cream.

Prepared just as called for in original recipe.  Then I added some Italian sausages that I browned for 5 minutes, reduced heat to low, added 1/2 cup beer to pan, covered and cooked through for 12 more minutes.  Sliced the sausages and added to the fried cabbage/egg noodle mixture.  Pure heaven!

I really don’t understand all the great reviews.  As is, the recipe is extremely bland.  Maybe that’s how it is supposed to be but to my family and I, it really lacked flavor.  I added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic and one medium sized onion sautéed to the mixture the 2nd time.  This greatly improved the flavor.

This is probably one of the more simple recipes, yet it turns out just as good as others. Cooking time took me quite a bit longer but that is fine. I'll keep this one in my recipe box!

This was great and super simple! We cook organically and the organic butter with the flavorful organic cabbage was quite tasty. I did not have egg noodles so I used what I had on hand and the kids ate every bite. My husband who is Spanish and does not like most of my German Heritage food asked for more. I enjoyed the filling sensation and warmth on a cold wintering wet day. I think next time I will add some onions and garlic for  a new taste sensation.  (One way to get your kids to eat cabbage and greens!)

This is one of my favorite dishes, we have this often and I grew up eating this. I just made this the other day and realized I never reviewed. This is wonderful as written, but my family sometimes adds some chopped onion and a few tablespoons of olive oil. This is comfort food at it's best for me! This is wonderful served with a dollop of sour cream, trust me, it's good. Thanks for posting this, this will always be a favorite in my family :)

My Mom has made this flavorful dish for years and I wanted to share it with my husband.  Needless to say he asked me to make more of it 2 nights in a row!  I did change/add a few things.  I used a medium head of purple and green cabbage, added Tonys Creole seasoning and cubed ham.  It was FABULOUS!

I make this frequently. I usually make it as written in the recipe, though sometimes I will add a little oil so the butter won't burn, or I will use a combo of regular and light butter to cut down on calories. These modifications produce the same result in my opinion. I am vegetarian and will often throw in slices of Lightlife Italian "sausages" at the end that I sear off in the pan's leftover butter.

Love this! We do ours low and slow. Cabbage is very tender as well as the onions we added. To round it out a little hardier, I add sliced keilbasi browned in separate pan.

This turned out pretty good, but I think it would have been better using Spaetzel instead of noodles.  But everyone liked it.

I really enjoyed this dish.  Definitely had to cook the cabbage for longer than indicated, but it still turned out well.  I think next time I'll add some garlic powder to it, as well as more salt and pepper.

This has always been a favorite of mine. I've made it as written, but I also like it with the addition of a bit of Hungarian paprika and/or a TINY bit of nutmeg. I don't know why, but the flavors are perfect for each other. I normally get the butter lightly browned before beginning to add the cabbage, then cook until the cabbage is just tender before adding the pasta. Make sure your pasta is well drained, and then you should be able to achieve a nice browning on both the pasta and cabbage at the same time, which is complemented beautifully by the nutty butter flavor.

Delicious and easy.  When I'm feeling especially energetic  I'll make homemade noodles for this dish, but it tastes great with store-bought.  Sometimes will throw in smoked sausage or cubed ham near end of cooking cycle for a heartier dish, but it isn't necessary as this is great all on it's own.

This is delicious. Rather than the green cabbage, I used a pound of coarsely chopped mixed-color cabbage (red, and a couple of different greens) and only added about 80% of the noodles. Used Whole Foods creamy salted butter. Since I will be eating all of it myself, the second time I added a can of drained and rinsed Pinto beans to the remaining portion. It's a big volume of food but worth eating some of it every day. I would not hesitate to serve this to guests.

I love cabbage , I sautéed a large onion with garlic and a lot of black pepper (I like it spicy) with a pinch of all spice & also added red peppers . Super easy to make, no fail. I finished in oven in my Dutch oven pan to get the browning to the noodle. Love it! I'm vegetarian, and ate this for dinner just like this.

It was good.  Added small diced onions, and diced Red Bell Pepper, used No yolk egg noodles pasta.  Note: cabbage or pasta neither one browned like the recipe said but it was still good.  The recipe as modified is very good but it is one of the blandest looking recipes I have ever made.  No eye appeal at all.

We love cabbage  and noodles in our house. This is a good recipe! My BaBa's  recipe calls for frying onions in butter. I make mine a little bit different. I add one   more thing .After the noodles are done and the butter starts to brown, I add the onions to the butter (you have to watch that the onions don't burn).I then crumble up an 10 ounce package of Queso Fresco Cheese  or as much as you like(found in the Mexican section of a supermarket) in a deep bowl, pile on the hot,drained noodles, then the butter and onions and cabbage mix ,
then gently mix together. Makes a great meal! I sometimes sprinkle on some hot sauce before I eat mine but it isn't necessary. I do find that bow tie pasta works well when adding cheese.

I did as others suggested and added onion and garlic and I still found it to be bland and not much flavor.  I do love cooked cabbage and will try this again with some more changes for flavor.

It needs something more to make it worth all of that butter.  Be sure to use an entire large cabbage, and I do agree with those who added additional ingredients (onions, garlic.)  I'd like to make this in a healthier way maybe -- whole grain noodles, olive oil, cabbage, onions or onion powder.

Simply loved it! I took the advice from another post and added a teaspoon of Fennel and sugar to the butter before adding the cabbage. I also chopped up a onion and two cloves of garlic and added that to the cabbage . I cooked it down until nice and carmelized.. Added the cooked noodles and added salt and pepper to taste. Upon serving I sprinkled some Parmesan cheese for a little extra flavour. Will make again. Family loved it!??

I found this recipe by accident and I am glad I did. Great as is but I added one other ingredient, bacon! Try adding four slices of crisp and crumbled bacon when you are finished making the recipe. My m-i-l also adds in some of the bacon grease while trying cooking the cabbage. Yum!

Absolutely delicious! Made it just like the recipe but it took more like 20-25 minutes for the cabbage to cook. Start it first. Made it into a full meal by adding browned ground turkey to it. We love it. My husband asked for seconds. He never does that.

This one is easy to make and tastes great, but it will be a non-keeper for us. Our son picked out the cabbage and we made a big oversight. Egg noodles are made with wheat and we have a member of the family with Celiac Disease.

The only modification I made was to add chicken.  I had 1 chicken breast left over so I cut into bite-size pieces and put on top before serving.  The family loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I can't have cabbage without onions, and I love red cabbage so I changed this recipe and used red cabbage instead of green, added an onion and some garlic.  Will definitely make it again.

I took advice from some of the other reviews and added a tablespoon of minced garlic and one half of a white onion, diced, as well as 14 oz. of kielbasa, cut into small pieces.  I was a bit worried that a whole head of cabbage would be too much, but was surprised at how much it cooked down and, after initially adding just one half head, added the balance.  Even with the garlic and onion, I felt that the result was a little on the bland side but, since I think the published recipe has its basis in German cuisine, that is probably normal.  I tried mixing in a little sriracha which spiced it up a bit to my taste, but what really made the difference was tossing in a light coating of some garlic sesame dipping sauce/glaze which really added some pizazz.  Overall, I liked the dish very much as far as its mouth-feel and its simplicity of preparation.  I think I'll be adding it to my list of regularly prepared meals.  It's a great base dish for experimentation, and I look forward to trying it with sauteed cubed chicken breast in place of the kielbasa.

I added a chilli Himalayan salt and garlic to it. To give it a little kick, and fried it in coconut oil. To cut a bit of the salt. Loved it. Quick and satisfying.

This was delicious. I cut down on the butter a bit and used a combo of butter and olive oil. I also had some slices of leftover pork loin so I chopped those up and added them to warm, then put in some crumbled bacon. A very quick, nutritious and delicious dinner. My guys loved it!

This is a favorite at our house. The ultimate comfort food, you can't go wrong. I've used green cabbage and a mix of red and green and it's been fabulous every time. We love it. (I have kids between the ages of 14-5 and they all love it)

After reading through the posted recipe, I thought it might be kinda bland, so took other advice.  Scaled down to serving for 1,  as I'm not much of a cabbage person.  Method:  2 oz egg noodles boiled to al dente & drained.  1 minced clove garlic & 1/4 onion diced sautéed in butter & EVOO combo.  Add1 cup bagged cole slaw mix of cabbage stirring 'til reduced (only takes 1-2 mins).  Add fully drained noodles.  Mixed & tossed over med-heat 'til noodles got some juice.  Smelled heavenly and was I amazed!!  Perfect amount and excellent flavor!!  Have added to rotation.

I ate 3 bowls of this dish! Frying the cabbage  in butter brought out a hint of sweetness. I wasn't sure about this dish when I came across it but it's cheap and super easy to fix.

OK, full disclosure - I altered this recipe a bit, after scaling down for the two of us: I sauteed half a sliced onion, and added a cup of leftover shredded chicken.  Also added a small glug of sherry, because I like it.  This is a very mild flavored dish, and it was helped with the Parm we sprinkled on top.  Will make this again.

My husband and I loved this simple yet savory dish. I made it as directed with the exception of frying a thinly sliced yellow onion with the cabbage. Topped with a sprinkle of sea salt and freshly ground pepper, it was a delicious meatless meal that I will definitely make again.

This isn't just a German dish. Polish and the rest of the Czech communities call this "Hiluski". Been making and eating this for more than 50 years just like my mother, grandmother and aunts taught me and use to make. Reading many reviews where people weren't crazy about the cabbage, then stay away from cabbage dishes , hot dogs and kraut altogether. I look at it this way. As an American, you've been spoiled by Mexican/Hispanic; Chinese/Japanese; Italian and just plain junk food fair.  When it comes to actual OLD World food, you can't take. So give it a try. While you're at it, try Perogies  with the various fillings. Give these other foods a try little by little and eventually they'll work they way into your hearts and bellies.

Better if you render down some chopped bacon, add a little butter to it and then saute the cabbage.  A healthy splash of apple cider vinegar is a nice touch at the end.

Just the way my mother taught me to make it.  All of the suggestions of what you can add are just fine, but the basic recipe is the best for comfort food.  I will continue to make this often!

I have been doing this for decades, but I use bacon cut into 1/2" pieces and browned and removed and it's fat to brown and reduce the cabbage without a cover.  Salt the shredded cabbage before cooking  to draw the water out.  After the cabbage has browned, then add back the back and the cooked noodles. It was my Hungarian grandmother's  favorite  for Christmas Eve and some 70 years later I always make it for that holiday.

I have been making this for years, but do not use butter.  My Polish mother-in-law only used leftover bacon drippings.
 Yes, a lot of fat  (so is butter), but the taste is  so much better!

Scrumptious!  Cabbage cut the heaviness of the pasta.  I also added sweet hungarian paprika to this - gave the cabbage a pleasing reddish color.  Even my teen ate it after saying, I don't know what to make of that!  The real tip is to not overcook the cabbage, don't make the thicker parts wilt only fork-tender.

A friend of mine of Eastern European origin made this for me this years ago. Who ever thought cabbage and noodles go so well together? It really is comfort food. I sometimes like to add diced chicken breast to make it a main dish. Sausage would be good too. Parmesan cheese?  Why not? I've even added a half cup of frozen white corn. Delicious. It's like fried rice, Let your imagination go wild, and make this dish your own!

I learned to make this from a Hungarian friend.  I've made it for years  I have added bacon, ham, polish sausage or served it just as it is.  I like a little onion too  As other report, you do need to like cabbage.

This was a recipe from my own childhood, with an Irish mother and a German father, and always served with whatever protein source they could afford at the time, whether it was a few hot dogs, or some leftover ham, or pork sausage.  Often thrown in were a few carrots sliced into "nickels."  This recipe is a modern-day version recreated perfectly and I need to submit even though I haven't made her recipe.  Because I know it is so right-on.

Love this dish. Sometimes I start with cooking bacon and onions then add cabbage. 
But don't go by the 5-7 minutes! Takes much longer to cook cabbage. More like 30 min. 
Delicious!

Hungarian cooking favorite! We use only broad noodles, start with 2 spoonful sugar in the oil, slowly caramelize, put the finely shredded cabbage, salt pepper and saute until lightly browned.
Mix with the noodles.   It is not sugary, just brings out the cabbage's natural sweetness. As kids we sprinkled some sugar on the plate. Caraway seed would not go on this cabbage.

Key is to lightly sauté the cabbage so you don't overcook it.  You want the cabbage to still be somewhat crunchy

Wonderful, simple comfort food. First, please let me vent... If you read the ingredient list and already know that you and or your kids don't like cabbage, don't  downgrade the recipe. You should have known going in that half of the ingredients weren't going to be a love match. That being said, this recipe is perfect the way it's written. Definitely five stars. Now, to bring it up to six stars, I caramelized a good sized onion and then added some minced garlic and sauteed that for a minute or so then added to the rest. Heaven on a plate as far as my peasant taste is concerned. ;-)

I make this all the time with an old school polish variation... I don't use butter, I fry bacon and use the bacon grease and garlic... Who could afford butter back in the day they would get a fat piece of pork and make it go a long way...lol

Haven't made this yet but I plan to.  Could add some crisp bacon or kielbasa to make it more of a meal, rather than side dish.  I am convinced it will be 5-star.  Love cabbage and noodles.

This is really great for cabbage lovers. I add 1 large onion, chopped, and several cloves of garlic. I sautee the onions/garlic until translucent, then add the cabbage and sautee until cabbage is wilted but not too soft. We also make this with a pound of browned ground beef and top it  with a light layer of shredded cheese for a casserole dinner.

We have made a version of this for years. We always add 1 lb of cooked pork sausage and a few red pepper flakes. This was one way to get our kids to eat cabbage.

As others suggested, I added chopped onion, minced garlic along with pieces of ham.  After adding the mixture together, it seemed too dry for me.  I then added a little chicken broth which gave it a lot of flavor.

My wife loves this dish, but my problem is the serving size.  It says this serves four.  A 16 oz bag of noodles and a head of cabbage seem to make a LOT more than 4 servings!  But maybe it's just me...

The ingredients called for are wayyy to much. I only have myself and 2 children to feed. I made adjustments like everyone else. It still taste very bland. Im going to go back and ad garlic powder. I hate to wast food and i think i just did. Gave 3 stars for the ideal.

The cabbage couldn't brown cause of all the butter and the overall outcome was very bland tasting. I added soy sauce to mine for flavor but then it just tasted like an Asian dish. Also, this makes A TON - a regular skillet isn't big enough (I had to use a wok), so I would recommend cutting the recipe in half.

This dish is sooo yummy.  I only added about half an onion and some garlic and cut down my butter to half a cube.  Excellent!

I'm not sure what to say about this. It was a bit bland, we had to add garlic powder, extra salt 'n pepper. Might add onions next time too, some minced garlic. There wasn't a lot of flavor to it, but we still liked it. 

We used about half a head of cabbage and 12 oz of egg noodles. Nothing browned. Not sure what I did wrong, and I'm sure it would taste even better that way, but the way it came out wasn't exceptional.

4 stars because I like the idea, but it needs a little work...

I grew up with this same dish, only my Hungarian grandmother called it Haluska (pronounced "haluSHka"). This is one of my favorite meals, super quick and easy to prepare and absolutely delicious! Definitely comfort food. Though my grandmother (and father) never added onions, I do like to add them, plus some minced garlic.
