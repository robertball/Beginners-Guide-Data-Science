I had a lot of fun with this recipe.  The meat ended up marinating for almost 11 hours and was very tender and tasty.  To give the sauce an authentic middle-eastern flavor, I added lots more dill and some dried mint, which put the sauce over the top.  I also drained some of the moisture from the diced cucumbers by salting them and letting them sit in a colander for a couple of hours.  Try Dannon plain yogurt, it holds up well.  YUM!  I warmed the pitas by brushing them with olive oil, sprinkling them with some dried herbs and kosher salt then putting them in a 400 degree oven for 4 minutes.  I served the sandwiches with slices of Vidalia onion, tomato slices, brown rice and salad.  The rice was great with the sauce and some onion on the top.  My husband gave the meal a "10".

This recipe was really tasty.  The only problem I had was with the yogurt sauce.  It was too watery and bland.  I think next time I'll strain the yogurt with a cheese cloth and add some sour cream too for flavor.  I used dried dill too, maybe fresh dill will have more flavor.  The meat was really tender though and the marinade was delicious.  I'll make this again for sure.

I thought that this would maybe taste like the flatbread sandwiches at Miami Subs. I was wrong. It is quite good but I will make some changes next time I make this. For starters London Broil in my opinion is simply too tough a cut to make sandwiches out of. I will try brisket next go. The sauce had an afterbite and had poor consistency. I added sour cream, a dollop of mayo and a tiny bit of sugar to conteract the bitter after taste I was experiencing. The sauce then, to me and my family became wonderful. Despite the trouble I had with it I would still recommend this recipe.

I ran short of time so I only marinated my beef for about 45 mins.  Also, I forgot to buy a lemon so I used water instead and it worked just fine.  My husband doesn't like dill so I left that out and I don't think it detracted from the taste.  I liked the coolness that the yogurt and cucumber added to the beef but my husband wasn't too fond of it.  I would probably make this again since my husband loved how the meat tasted.

This dish was great!  Unfortunately, the beef that I bought was too thick to pound out, so after marinading, I just sliced it really then and then sauteed it.  It turned out wonderfully.

Great recipe!

Very economical & easy to make.  I spruced this up with a little dried mint as well. Super yummy!  It's a quick way to make the Tzatziki everyone seems to love!

Be sure to get the right cut.  Ask your butcher.  I bought a cut that was too tough and that is on me.  Add garlic to the tzatziki sauce and you'll improve it greatly.  Also, I skipped the lettuce for garnish and just garnished with onion and tomato to make this as close to a gyro as can be.
