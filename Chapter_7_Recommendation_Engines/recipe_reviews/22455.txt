Holy Cow!  I've made this twice and I don't think you can make this wrong. Both times, they turned out VERY well - creamy, chocolaty, absolutely delicious! Everyone LOVED them! Definitely a recipe to keep on hand for a quick, tasty dessert!

I made these for a party Saturday night & I'll tell ya, they worked out great.  Instead of a "vanilla wafer" which is too small, I used peanut butter cookie dough (that I bought from market day) and used about 1/2 tbsp. smashed down to fit into the bottom of each cup, then baked them for about 10 min., and then followed the recipe from there.  Topped them with the sour cream mixture and then frozen mixed berries (thawed) with a little of the "juice" for each.  They turned out great.  I suggest doubling the sour cream mixture, it doesn't go very far, and is pretty tasty.  Thanks Hershey's!

The sour cream topping was tasty, but that's about all good I can say about these cheesecakes.  The vanilla wafer cookie did NOT form a crust as  it was too small so it just made the cheesecake look strange.  The chocolate taste of the cheesecake was very bitter.  If not for the topping, these would have been inedible.

This by far was the easiest and most delicious cheesecake recipe I have ever made! I used dark cherries instead of the light and when I served this to my guests I drizzled cherry puree on a cold plate and placed the cheesecake on the plate. (without the paper of course)What a beautiful presentation it made!

Great, pretty desert. I make allot of cheesecakes and I really liked how these could travel with out a spring pan that I never get the bottom back. Easy to make for a large party too. I did think that they tasted more like a mouse, I also had to cook for an additional 10 min. They came out of the oven nice & high but when they cooled the sunk in the middle. When you add the SC topping no one could notice. I used the standard muffin size cups but next time I will go one size smaller (not mini). I think that will make the wafer be a crust for the whole thing rather than just the middle. It does look very X-Mas like, but you could top with any fruit filling to change the color. I will make often.

These were really good.  This was really my first attempt at a home cheesecake..(I've never made one in a springform pan), and I had great results.  I don't think I've ever tried "Black Forest Cheesecake" in the past, but really enjoyed the mixed flavors.  I'm not a sour cream person, but eating it with a cherry pie filling was actually good. They turned out really moist. When the evening was over, I hid in the kitchen and finished off what was left over.    Thanks Hershey's

Excellent,excellent!! Made this for a Super Bowl Party and everyone loved it.  You could make this a sugar free dessert by substituting sweetner for sugar very easily. Used lite cherry pie filing. Definitely a keeper. Thanks.

Thank you thank you!  This was exactly what I was looking for to round out my dessert buffet..it was elegant, tasty and easy to prepare.  I actually made it with non dairy cream cheese and sour cream, but skipped the sour cream topping on top.  Instead I melted choc chips, put a dab on each, and a white choc chip in the center.  I did add extra cocoa to the batter and they were delicious!

I made this recipe for church social and they went like hotcakes. I had no trouble making the recipe work for me. I made over 100 of them and they were all gone in a mater of minutes. People were coming up to me and requesting the recipe all night so I just told them where they could find it. Marissa

Too good! I topped some with blueberry pie filling and some with cherry pie filling. I halved the recipe (just 1 egg and half of the rest). They are awesome!

Everyone loved these; used Oreo cookie halves for crust (just twist apart) and raspberry pie filling for topping.

These are just an excellent "make ahead" dessert.  I made them for a bridal shower and a gathering of my husband's co-workers.  Everyone loved them!  Any time you can make food items ahead of time always adds to the convenience.  These have the added advantage of tasting wonderful also.

This is my new favorite party desert. It's absolutely full proof and delicious. At home I take the left over cherry pie filling, put it in a plastic baggie, cut a tiny hole in the corner and drizzle the filling on a desert plate and place the cheesecake without the muffin wrapper right in the center. It makes a beautiful presentation!

These were a HUGE hit at our 10th wedding anniversary.  My family isn't big on sour cream so instead of the topping, I used creamed cream cheese and sugar and topped it with that.  HUGE hit.  Highly reccomended.

Very easy and delicious!!  Accidentally bought fat free sour cream, and still was wonderful.  May try reduced fat or fat free cream cheese next time to make it even healthier.  Everyone loved these.

very yummy.  couldn't find a 21 oz can of cherries, so used 15 oz instead and it was fine.  Did not need to use the second can I bought, but it does mean I will make this again soon!

This came out looking fantastic but I wasn't big on the sour cream/sugar topping. I'll probably skip that next time & opt for a dab of whipped cream instead. Good recipe & I will probably make again.

This recipe was loved by my entire family, but it wasn't their VERY favorite. I didn't put vanilla wafer cookies at the bottom, because I didn't have any at the time but they still turned out great!

Not only was this fun to make but they were also fun to eat.  They tasted great and everyone loved the fact of eating their own individual chocolate cheesecakes.  I think i bought vanilla wafers that might have been to small because they were not the same size of the bottom of the cupcake holders.  but it still was great.

The taste is delicious and creamy. I think to get the look like the picture, the recipe will produce less than 24 cupcakes because you need to fill the batter almost to the top. I used to skip the sour cream topping but yesterday I tried it with the topping, just heavenly.

LOVED these. They were very easy and they looked like a lot more work. I also halved the recipe (used just one egg) and I used strawberry pie filling, because I'm not crazy about cherries. I loved the mix of the chocolaty cheesecake with the sour cream topping!

I just made this for a party and it was a huge hit! I used mini mini cupcake pans, with no papers. Instead, I crushed vanilla wafers and a little sugar in my food processor and pressed them into the pan with a shot glass. They held up perfectly! They were just big enough for one cherry on top - beautiful!

Great recipe...I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit.  Not too sweet, not too sour.  The overall review was awesome mini cheesecakes, but definitely without the cherry filling on top.  Unless you make your own cherry topping, I would say skip it.  That canned stuff tastes like plastic and ruins a perfect mini cheesecake.

These were very good.  My husband absolutely loved them and I thought they were just fine, thus the four star rating.  (More like a four and a half.)  No complaints though.  They're easy to freeze and pull out for unexpected company.  Just keep some canned pie filling on hand and you're set!

Great little party sized cheesecakes. I loved the way everything worked so well together. My girlfriends and I did these up for a bridal shower, and we not only had fun making them, everyone enjoyed them tremendously. 
Thanks to Hershey's Kitchens for the recipe.

Wow!!! So easy and so good! I, too, ran out of topping, so I topped some w/ melted mint Hershey Kisses & garnished w/ mini chips. I also made a batch w/ no cocoa and a little more almond extract, sour cream topping (yummy), & garnished w/ mini chips, almond slivers, & a cherry. They're great either size (reg. & mini).  Can't wait for the next party!!!

These are delicious, I made them for the Holidays and they went fast.  They're even good if you run out of the sour cream topping, just use the leftover fruit or just plain.  They are that good!

I tried blueberry on these and they didn't turn out real well..but overall it's pretty yummy. The almond extract flavor I think comes out too much, so next time I'd maybe use less.

Overall, the mini cheesecakes were delicious!  However, it was too much chocolate. 
I think next time, I'm going to skip the chocolate.

Make again?? I make 'em every year!  Everybody loves them.  I'll often keep the sour cream and cherries on the side, because some don't like either or both.  They always turn out great.

The only change I make are using refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough instead of vanilla wafers.  Put a small "cookie" in the bottom of foil muffin tins and bake for about five minutes and cool before filling-in the tins.

YUMM-O!

These are so unbelievably good. They're so rich and creamy and wonderful that words alone cannot describe the taste. I'm personally not a fan of sour cream AT ALL, in fact I hate it. I was a bit nervous about using it at first, especially in the topping, but it was so good I couldnt believe it.

Personally, I am not a big fan of cocoa in cheesecake - I think it compromises the essense of cheesecake.  However, hubbie & others LOVED this recipe and ranted & raved to great length abt. how good these were (the nilla wafers were a very clever touch).  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this yesterday for a B'day party at work.  Although, I really didn't care for this, it got good reviews from co-workers.  I'm a lover of cheesecake, just don't know what it was that I didn't like about this one.  Anyway, a 5 star rating from my fellow co-workers.  Thank you.
