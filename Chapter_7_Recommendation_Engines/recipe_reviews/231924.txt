This is an easy, one-dish meal.  The few changes I made were because of ingredients I had or didn't have on hand.  I did not have orange juice, so I substituted a Cointreau/water mixture.  I think it would be better with orange juice because of the added sweetness.  I added additional vegetables - broccoli and cabbage along with the carrots and peas.  I will make this again.

i think including the nutritional facts in the footnotes area is amazing!  this helps with meal planning and I plan on making this dish regardless. i am sure it will taste as how I will imagine it will.
