If I could rate it a negative I would! I did not care for this recipe. I am a pastry chef and was checking things out and since I had someone that I can't eat much fat I thought I would try it.     I followed it to a tee and was terribly disappointed! The taste of it was fake and it's supposed to be Key Lime Pie but it used LEMON JUICE? I thought that is really took away for the limey taste. Of course this is what we were looking for! Save your self the time, and agrivation. Don't bother with this recipe!

Not only did my meringue "weep" terribly but this pie failed to stay together at all when served and the crust was one of those that sticks in the teeth.  Still, it tasted good and although I was embarrassed to serve such a mess, my family ate the whole thing.  Next time I will try the Never Ever Fail Meringue.

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  My 9 year old son selected this recipe to make himself.  We substituted prepared graham cracker crust in place of the cornflake crust, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The entire family enjoyed this.

I used an already made graham cracker pie crust and this pie was easy & fabulous and definitely does not taste like a low fat dessert.  This one is a keeper.

This is the easiest dessert I have ever made. It turned out perfect and the presentation was wonderful. Everyone wanted the recipe! I used green food coloring instead of yellow to make it look lime-y instead of lemon-y. I was a bit sweeter than what I thought but I really enjoyed it!

I won't go back to using my traditional key lime pie recipe after trying this one. It's easy (a must for me) and delicious. I substituted Honey Bunches of Oats for cornflakes because that's what I had on hand and liked the crust a lot.
