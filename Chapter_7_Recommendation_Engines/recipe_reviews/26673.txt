I make a similar Sweet and sour meatball. I find that adding 1/4c of ketchup really adds a tangy flavour that this recipe seemed to lack .  I also substitute flour with cornstarch. It gives the meatballs a beautiful glazed effect.

I made the sauce, substituting the pineapple juice for water and cutting the brown sugar in half.  I also added about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, for a little twang.  I cheated a little and used store bought frozen meatballs that were heated in the oven.  Threw the meatballs in a crockpot, threw the cooked sauce over it and let it hang out for an hour.  It was a hit with everyone, including teenagers!

OK, so I'm giving this 5 stars, but that's with a lot of changes. I made them as appetizers for a shower, kept them small and put toothpicks in them for easy pick up from a baking pan. I made the recipe with 3# turkey meat (increasing all the other ingredients X3 of course) and made about 55 meatballs.  I spent a lot of time reading MANY of the reviews and this is what I came up with.
PEOPLE SAID:
Add onion soup mix to meat--did that
Bake instead of fry the meat--did that
Cut sugar in 1/2--did that
Cut soy sauce in 1/2--did that
Use cornstarch instead of flour--did that
Add pineapple to sauce--did that (1/2 can fruit)
with all the juice added to the water
Add red pepper to sauce--did that
Add ketchup--Used General Tsao Sauce instead of    ketchup. 
They turned out great. Made them a day ahead and put them in the oven to warm before serving. The only thing that I think I'll do different (even though people disagreed) is to add some General Tsao's right into the meat as well as to the sauce. I think it would add to the flavor. 

Hope this condensed version of comments will help keep you from spending a lot of time searching.

This was terrific.  The only changes I made was to use about 1/4 cup of onion flakes instead of regular onion and I almost doubled the recipe.  I still did not have any leftovers.  My kids loved it. I also cooked my meatballs first in the oven for 20 minutes to keep them from breaking apart and then I don't have to watch them.  Much easier that way.

Making the meatballs I added bread pieces soaked in milk instead of bread crumbs and added an additional egg.  With the sauce I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Chicken broth instead of water.  To top it off added pineapple chunks and green onion to garnish. It was exceptionally delicious, the sauce is also excellent for spareribs and chicken.

I was looking for something different to make with hamburger.  This was an excellent change of pace.  I served it over white rice and with a tossed salad.  I added some drained crushed pineapple to the sauce for a little extra flavor.  I also browned the meatballs and then placed them in a casserole and covered them with the sauce and baked at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes covered with aluminum foil.

This sweet and sour recipe was excellent!  I've tried many, this one is a keeper.  It was also nice to have beef with sweet and sour instead of chicken or pork always.  I will be making this sauce for lots of things besides these meatballs.

A very good recipe.  I seasoned my meatballs more to my taste, though.  This recipe called for no salt or other seasonings for the meatballs!  I did double the sauce ( we like a lot) but I only did 1 and half cups of brown sugar (not the full 2 cups) and it was plenty sweet.  A very good recipe.  I also added a little ketchup and used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken.

After frying the meatballs and thickening the sauce,I placed the cooked meatballs in the oven to complete the cooking process. These meatballs certainly live up to their name. Absolutely delectable.

My husband enjoys food but rarely comments on a meal unless I ask his opinion.  First bite of these meatballs, he commented on how great they were!  They were so quick and easy and I'm sure will make great leftovers.  Thanks!!

These are easy to make and pretty good, but too sweet for my taste. I even cut the sugar almost in half, although I added 1/4 c. ketchup. Also there was too much onion even though I used a very small onion. I baked the meatballs at 350 for about 25 minutes and simmered them in the sauce for only about 10 minutes. I will make these again but with less sugar and onion, and I think they'd be good with some spice to them.

This recipe turned out great!  I added orange zest to the beef mixture and ketchup to the sauce.  I also cooked the rice with chicken stock and orange juice and it all came together fabulously garnished with orange zest!

This recipe was great although I found it to be a little more sweet than sour. I chose to add some garlic to the sauce and used ground chicken instead of beef. Overall a great recipe.

I made 2 pans of these meatballs for Thanksgiving.  Let me tell u, my husband couldnt stop picking at them before we left and everyone kept asking who cooked the meatballs.  I love the sauce and it was sooooo easy for someone who doesnt cook.  I was so happy I chose this recipe to try for Thanksgiving.  I read the reviews and added a little bit of ketchup but honestly I think it was fine the way it was.  Thank u soo much for sharing will definitely be making this again.

The whole time I was eating this I was humming "mmmmmm". Thats how good this was. I did add some mustard to the meatballs, Put in oven for 10 mins. Than to sauce I cut the sugar in half, added 1/4 ketchup, only used a cup of water and used cider vinegar instead of white. Had this with jasmine rice which the sauce went prefect with and broccoli.

I actually used this recipe for the meatball sauce.  It was really yummy with the perfect amount of tanginess.

After reading reviews that said the sauce was more sweet than sour, I decided to reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, substituted 1/4 cup of water for pineapple juice and added about 2 tbls of ketchup.  It had just the right amount of sweetness.  My 4 kids (13,11,9,6) usually don't like new recipes and can be very picky...but they ALL ate their meatballs up quickly and said they were a thumbs yummy! I agree! Thanks!

This is a regular in our house, my husband loves it, my son loves it and I love it! This recipe tastes great and I usually have the ingredients on hand. I don't change a thing other than using frozen meatballs if I don't have the time to make fresh meatballs. I usually serve it with mashed potatoes and a side of vegetables, but have also used buttered noodles. YUM! Also, if there is sauce left over I freeze it to use it again later.

These were absolutely wonderful! My 11 yr. old daughter helped make them so it is pretty easy to make and kid-friendly. We did have to make sure they weren't larger than golf-ball sized. Those that were larger fell apart. The sauce is superb and paired with brown rice and a green veggie it is perfect. DH is pretty picky and he asked to have these again. Thank you for the keeper recipe!

I thought this was delicious! I took the advice of a few previous "reviewers" and added 1/4 cup ketchup and baked the meatballs in the oven for 20 minutes prior to adding them to the sauce. I would definitely make this again!

a good recipe for when you are low on groceries. i added a some ground ginger and ketchup to the sauce because i felt it needed a little something more. a good recipe for picky eaters that enjoy sweet and sour but usually pick around pineapple. i will try this again w/ green peppers and onions next time. i served this over rice w/ Chinese Broccoli Slaw as a side ( a great way to sneak broccoli in for picky eaters, BTW)

i cooked this for my uncle, and he couldnt get enough! when he came home from work the next day he said "it tasted even better for lunch!".i love this recipe too. before i browned the meatballs i stuck them in the oven at 350/375-depends on the oven-for twenty minutes. i found that even though white rice is a nice balance, if you dont like super sweet  things, balance it out with pinapple (canned or fresh, anything will do). other than that a wonderful recipe. put it over rice with some pinapple and bon apiteite!

The only change I made to this recipe was I did not use an entire onion, I used about half. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly as written and I absolutely love it. I will be making this again. Thanks for submitting.

I was searching for a meatball recipe to try out.  I read all the great reviews about this one and decided to try it out.  I wasn't sure how the brown sugar/vinegar combo would turn out.  It was great!  This one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

I combined the sauce ingredients in a crock pot on high before I began the meatballs and added the them to the sauce for about an hour. I forgot to add the soy sauce, but they turned out great. Easy recipe and nice alternative to the jelly/ chili sauce recipe.

these were very good.  i had trouble with the sauce being too watery and separated in my crock pot so i poured the mixture onto the stove for a hot second and boiled it, that did the trick.  it thickened right up and had a perfect shine (i followed someone else's sugg to use cornstarch instead for the beautiful glossy sause)

I took some tips from Dianne and only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and added in some ketchup.  I put these into my slow cooker and poured the sauce over.  I cooked it on high for 1 hour and then on low for about 8 more hours.  The meatballs were so tender and moist and full of the flavor from the sauce.  So tasty - everyone loved them!

Added half a can of crushed pineapple to sauce, 1/4cup ketchup,and all the juice from the canned pineapple(1/2cup) with 1cup water.  Excellent and will make again! Think I prefer littler meatballs though, so will make half sized ones next time. Ty!

We had this for dinner tonight - it was awesome!!!  I was afraid the sauce would be either too sweet or too vinegary, but it was just right.  Very savory and not too sweet!  The sauce was excellent over rice.  - Allison

This recipe was quick and easy to make, and came out VERY delicious.  Rather than deep fry my meatballs I baked them at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  I have never made sweet and sour meatballs before, but these turned out great!!!

I've never had sweet and sour meatballs that were this sweet.  Will make again, but definitely using 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of full cup.

These were awesome! I was looking for something different to use with ground beef and this is definetly something to throw into dinner rotation. I almost always try the recipe as given first but after I got all sauce ing in the pot it looked a little blah, the ketchup as another person recommended was what it   was missing. Sauce thickened up beautifully. Thanks for great recipe!

I'm a little torn on my review.....I decided to follow suggestions of others who added ketchup & worchestschire sauce & cornstarch instead of flour.

The cornstarch was a terrific idea......while the ketchup & worchestschire sauce was a horrible, HORRIBLE idea!!!

I'll try this again in a few weeks with the original recipe. I also used premade meatballs.

I liked these. I thought the sauce was a little too thin, so I added some cornstarch, which still didn't quite get to my idea of "saucy," it was more "brothy." I liked the taste though, and the next day ate the leftovers with rice- definitely better overnight. Thanks!

After reading reviews, I decided to make the balls smaller sized too.  They worked out very nice!  Very delicious!  I think that these meatballs would also work well with Spaghetti - simmered in a tomato sauce instead of the Sweet and Sour.  I took your suggestion and served it with rice and asian stir-fry vegetables, worked out pretty well, even the kids liked it =)  Next time I will use less onion - and dice it up much smaller.  There was so much onion that the meatballs had a hard time sticking together, and the "diced" pieces also made it harder to keep together.  Am still very pleased with the taste, will use this recipe again!  Thanks!

I found this to be simple to make and by adding sliced carrots, onions, garlic cloves and mushrooms (canned) it became a perfect company dish. I put it all in a casserole and completed it in the oven (rather than stovetop) at 325 deg. for 30 min.  Served with rice it is looks, smells & tastes wonderful.  Thanks, Gwen,, Calgary, Alberta,

These were definitely good, and I will make them again, but the meatballs need more seasonings and some salt wouldn't hurt, either. The sauce was good and was perfect over rice, but something was missing. Maybe adding a little ketchup next time might help.

These were so good! I got full and still wanted to keep eating! my boyfriend is allergic to chicken so i'm always looking for ways to change things up this was great! i looked at previous reviews and changed tweaked the sauce by using pineapple juice instead of water, corn starch instead of flour and added 4 teaspoons of ketchup. With the meatballs i browned them a lil on both sides and to firm them a lil more i put them in a 350 degree oven for about 10-15 minutes then added them to the sauce and cooked about 20 minutes! So yummy over brown rice! will make again my boyfriend scraped his plate clean!!

I used pre- made turkey meatballs and followed the sauce recipe as follows withthe addition of 2 tbsp. of ketchup.  I also added chopped red/orange bell pepper, chopped onion and one rib of choped celery. I threw everything in a pot and let everything cook together for about thirty minutes.  Served it over brown rice with a side salad. Great recipe!

These were really good, with a couple modifications based on recommendations from other reviewers.  I'm only giving the recipe four stars because, as-written, the meatballs would be bland and the sauce would be far too sweet.  I doubled the sauce (won't do that next time...made WAY too much), but only used 1-1/2 cups of brown sugar.  Even then it was a tiny bit too sweet for me, but my fiance and daughter loved it.  I also used corn starch instead of flour to thicken the sauce, which gave it a beautiful clear, shiny appearance instead of making it cloudy like gravy.  I used ground turkey instead of beef because I always sub turkey instead of beef in ground meat recipes.  I only had Italian bread crumbs on hand, but I think the seasoning in them just made things better.  I did add a little salt and pepper to the meatball mixture as well.  I served these over brown jasmine rice that had been cooked in chicken broth along with sesame soy ginger broccoli.  My fiance, who moved in with me a few months ago and truly enjoys my cooking, said this was the best meal I've served him yet!

My husband rates these meatballs 4 stars. He likes than, but I felt they were too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly, but used dehydrated onion instead of fresh.  I also made the meatballs smaller.  The sauce is nice and thick and coats the meatballs well. I think if I added something more to the sauce it could be even better.

This recipe is good, but only with a LOT of tweaks. There is way too much brown sugar; it needs to be halved at least. Otherwise you need to increase the vinegar and soy sauce. Also, ketchup is a must--a good amount of it. While it would be easy to keep this recipe if you remember the additions, it would be easier to use a different recipe.

I bought extra lean ground beef fresh from the butcher's.  I made the meatballs as directed but substituted a third of a package of onion soup mix for the onion.  I baked the meatballs for 15 minutes at 350 instead of frying them.  I think the meatballs would have been juicier if I had used regular ground beef.  It's cheaper and probably would have been less dry.    The sauce is the star of this recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I added 1/8 of a cup of ketchup.  Hubby loved it and I've been told to keep this recipe.  He's very picky.  I'm glad I found this recipe.  This will be my only S&S sauce recipe from now on.  Thanks KIMMY D.

These are wonderful.  I was a bit daring and made a triple batch.  So glad I did.  I would, however, next time reduce the brown sugar, by a bit.  I cooked my meatballs in the oven at 400 for about 18 minutes and then added them to the sauce to simmer.  We had them with white rice and steamed veggies.  A wonderful dinner.

Awesome meatballs!  I used ground chicken instead of beef.  For the sauce I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added about 1/4 cup ketchup.  Next time I will use even less sugar, more like 1/2 cup.  Definitely serve over rice to soak up the wonderful sauce.  Next time I'll add some frozen veggies and call it an easy, great meal!

Yummy!  Easy peasy lemon squeezy.  I used some of the suggestions I found from the other reviewers and they were good, but next time I'll try the original way. :)

Yummy!  I put them in my crockpot and they were able to stay on the table for a long period of time.  I usually do the cocktail sauce/grape jelly recipe, but tried these and will do these again....much more delicious!

This recipe is so easy and the taste is very impressive. It works great with homemade or frozen meatballs. Try frozen store bought meatballs with this sauce in the slow cooker for a super easy meal, and serve with rice and your favorite vegetable. I also agree with the other review that adding a touch of ketchup improves the sweet and sour flavor. Thanks for sharing.

I used prepared frozen meatballs due to time restraints. I also used 1/4 cup ketchup and substituted cornstarch for the flour. Sauce was great and held together well. I also added some mixed vegetables to the mix and had a great one pan meal!! I will definately make this again!!

Very good. Cut sugar in half and added 1/4 cup of catchup. I doubled the recipe and served as appetizers. If you do serve them as appetizers, I would recommend putting them in a crock pot with slightly less sauce. The people at the party enjoyed them, but had a tough time finding them since there was lots of sauce.

This recipe was really good - the only drawback is that it was missing a bit of tang. The second time I made this, I added pineapple chunks, which really helped. I love having sweet and sour meatballs over rice. Also, as a side-note: I was somewhat of a novice at making meatballs - the first time I made this they kind of fell apart because the meat wasn't cold enough. So make sure the meat is nice and cold in order to have meatballs that hold their shape.

I made this because we had pretty much no food in the house, and I could make this without going grocery shopping. This was surprisingly tasty! I took a reviewer's suggestion and used corn starch instead of flour, and added red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick.

made this for dinner tonight and it was delish! I baked it in the oven at 180deg for 40min and the meatballs came out perfectly. I followed some other recommendations about adding crushed pineapple and added a nice flavour. Next time I'm going to add some dried chillies as well for a little kick. will definitely be making this again. thanks for the great recipe!

Made these for my husband and his buddy who stayed for supper, and they both gave it a thumbs up. They said I could cook try new recipes any time if they were as good as this one. I subbed oatmeal for the bread crumbs and doubled the sauce recipe. Delicious!

This is a great base recipe, but is kind of bland as it is.  I added some onions, red pepper, and ginger which I sauteed before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.  It was great, family liked it, I loved it.

SO SO SO good!!! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only change I made was I used minced dry onions instead of chopping one. I usually don't do that but that's what I had and I didn't want to go to the store for an onion. I loved these so much! They are so easy, and so good! I laid them over white rice w/ broccoli on the side. They are also good leftover. I am making them again this weekend!

These little puppies ROCK!  Made *almost* as directed except only used about 1/4 cup onion and added 1T of s&s mixture to meat (which I baked so I could use the cool little meatball pan my son bought me).  For sauce, only used 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 3T of ketcup, and rest as directed.  It was absolutely perfect.  Served over rice with green onions tossed on top and a napa style salad on the side.  Will def make again. UPDATE:  I don't know what I did differently this time with the meatballs, but they were terribly awfully bland (???) Next time be sure to add salt, pepper, garlic, maybe some ginger or hotsauce?

Everyone liked this! My husband and four kids (11-20), and I! Seconds for all the kids! Very easy to make. I made as listed for the sauce, but used a package of Simeks meatballs from the grocery store because I had them on hand and was short on time! We will definitely be making this again. Served with green beans which went well with it. Also, made a side serving for my vegetarian daughter using one of her Asian soy burgers in place of the meatballs. Rave reviews from her too. We all thought it might be a bit strange, but were all pleasantly surprised. Thanks for an easy, last minute recipe that more than met our expectations!

So delicous!  I read some reviews and substituted cornstarch for flour, added 1/4 cup ketchup.  My only issue is that these were a bit sweet.  I think I'll do around 1/2 or 3/4 the amount of brown sugar next time.  Overall an AWESOME recipe!

This recipe deserves a 10 star rating.  Don't hesitate to make it because it is that good.  My husband snubbed his nose at me when he saw me making it, but as it was cooking he commented on how good it smelled.  Well, it tasted 100 times better than it smelled.  I used corn starch to thicken and did add in a little ketchup because after tasting it, I felt it would add in a little more kick.  Served with rice and a garden salad.  YUMMY.  Even better the next day but do cut the meatballs in half so that they warm up completely for you.

This review might not be fair because I only used about half the amount of brown sugar the recipe calls for but I think if I had used all of it I would have hated it. I also used a little ketchup and corn starch instead of flower. They were good but I think the sauce just was not my thing but there was nothing wrong with them at all. Maybe I just don't like sweet and sour on anything other than chicken.

Even with less sugar, these were too sweet for my taste and they didn’t go well with rice.  They did appeal to my children and they may also be good as an appetizer.

I halved the brown sugar and I still found this really sweet. I didn't really care for the flavour at all - there was nothing distinct about it. I won't make this again.

Yum!  I cut only slightly back on the brown sugar and thought these were absolutely delicious!  Everything comes together so nicely!  I served these over jasmine rice with plenty of sauce and a side salad.  Great dinner for us!

These were  great.  The only change I had was to half the sugar, a tablespoon of Asian hot sauce, and add a couple of squirts of ketchup.  Next time I'd add a second egg so they hold up better.

My family liked these "OK,", but we found them to not have as much flavor as we hoped.  We'll stick with our BBQ Saurkraut Crockpot meatballs.

Having never made meatballs before this looked like a good recipe to start with!  Very easy & didn't require a whole lot of ingredients.  They were a little more on the sweet side then I thought they'd be, but my husband (who is an actual chef) LOVED them!  Will definitely  be making these again! Thanks!
**Update** Made these a second time when a friend came over for dinner... his reaction "These are WAY better than even what my Grandmother makes".  Can't go wrong there!

I used this recipe for the sauce and made the meatballs with my own seasonings.  I also baked them instead of frying them. The sauce was pretty good! I added 1/4 cup of ketchup like others had suggested.  We ate the meatballs with rice and I ate the leftovers on a sub roll with cheese the next day.  Tasty both ways and fairly easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

Im giving this a 4 based on the changes I made. Used 3/4 C brown sugar, next time would use 1/2C, doubled the vinegar, and added 1/4 C ketchup. Also substituted cornstarch for the flour- had I not made these changes it would have been entirely too sweet for our tastes.  Served over rice and garnished with green onions and an additional dash of soy. With these changes I will make again for an easy weeknight meal.

I made these and my husband loved them! I did add 1/4 cup of ketchup to the sauce and instead of using ground beef, I used Morning Star Farms crumblers which is a vegetarian meat substitute. I ate them with white rice and my husband ate them by themselves! We will definitely be having them again!

I used frozen meatballs, but the sauce was wonderful. Outside of an extra squirt of ketchup I followed the ingredients and we all thought it was great! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is simply delicious, served over mashed potatoes (instant, btw) or rice. I agree with the suggestion of another reviewer to cook the meatballs in the oven so they don't break apart, that worked very well, thank you! (I cooked them at 350 for about 20 minutes.) Didn't use ketchup, was very pleased. Easy to prepare & very tastey! I WILL be making this again!!

This was awesome!  I did substitute Teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce since I was out.  Still great!  Since I used elk hamburger I used extra bread crumbs and 2 eggs to keep it together better.

I didn't have a enought time to make the meatballs so I used store bought Italian meatballs and they were fantastic!  My family wasn't too sure about it but they all had seconds.  I added some chopped green pepper and canned pineapple to the sauce.

Very good meatballs.  Next time I would use less than a whole diced onion.  It was a little too much onion for my taste and I LOVE onions.

Delicious recipe! As recommended by a reviewer, I also baked the meatballs for about 20 minutes uncovered at 350. I reduced the sauce ingredients in a separate pan before adding the meatballs. I also took the recommendation of adding 1/4 cup of ketchup, but found that it was WAY too sweet, so I added an additional 1/4 of vinegar. Will definitely make this again!

I really liked this! It was so easy!
Next time I'm going to add cut up green pepper and serve it over rice. I would add cut up pineapple but my husband doesn't like that. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years and it still gets raves!  I substitute all the time, sometimes turkey ground, brown sugar Splenda, low sodium soy sauce, and italian style bread crumbs.  I bake the meatballs and then throw them in the sauce.  ALWAYS DELICIOUS!

These need just a bit more flavor.  I added crushed pineapple and took another reviewers suggestion and after browning the meatballs, put them in the sauce and baked it for about 40 minutes.  I am glad I added the pineapple, next time I will add seasoning to the meat first.

This was a great recipe.  I did add a couple things as was suggested.  I minced garlic, salt, pepper, chili powder, and season salt to the meatballs.  Then I added a splash of worcestershire and about 1/4 ketchup to the sauce.  Served it with rice and asparagus.

Very tasty.  My two complaints are that, like others, the meat balls completely fell apart on me even though I browned them in the oven instead of using the skillet, and there is just way too much onion in this recipe.  I love onion, but wow, I think it could be cut down to half an onion or use flakes.  Too much onion might be contributing to inability for the meatballs to stay together.  I'll probably try flakes and making the meatballs smaller next time.  The sauce was delicious!

Loved this recipe!! I doubled the meatballs and tripled the sauce (I served them as appetizers in a crock pot, so I wanted lots of sauce!) They were fantastic.

Thanks for a great recipe! I'm keeping this one and making it over and over. :)

This is great but the only problem I found was the meatballs would break apart after you put them in the saucepan....best thing I would say is to brown them in the oven!!!!!  Otherwise no complaints.

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted great. The only things I added to the sauce were fresh grated ginger, a clove of garlic, 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple, and half of a red and half of a green pepper. It gave it more flavor and made it more of a complete meal. I will be making this again!

This is the BEST meatball recipe EVER!  I make it almost every weekend for the OSU games.  Always a hit and it keeps bringing people back!  I also used the apple cider and chicken broth.
I also used ground turkey the 2nd time and think it tastes 10 times better!!!

I actually liked this recipe....didn't think that I would.  The sauce was a perfect combo of sweet and tangy (vinegar amount was perfect).  I did add some garlic to the meatball (what meatball doesn't have garlic).  I wish I would have had some pineapples to add which I think would have made this even better.  I chopped up some green onions for garnish and just a bit of crunch. I also baked at 325 for 25 minutes and broiled on low for another 5.  Then I put the meatballs in the sauce for another 10-15 minutes.  Nice idea, thanks for the post.

I also baked my meatballs in the oven for about 20 to 23 minutes. I found the sauce to be a bit bland when I tasted it so I added a little bit of ketchup (approx. 1tsp) and it helped to add some flavour. I also served it over rice. It was great, my boyfriend even loved it!

Tried this recipe for New Years Eve party. It was good but the meatballs didn't have enough zing. If I make the recipe again, I'll add some ginger or maybe 5 spice seasoning to the meatballs. Instead of flour, I used cornstarch to prevent clumping.

These were the best! I have since served them three times (three different parties), and each time they are a hit. I cheated and bought frozen italian meatballs. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon on ground ginger. 
This recipe is yummy, fast and easy! Thanks!

Great recipe, it's a nice alternative to the usual pineapple-based recipes.  The sauce can be a little thin, but some corn starch thickens it up nicely.

Really great recipe... easy and everyone loved it. I did add salt and pepper to the meatball mixture, as well as a little ground ginger. For the sauce I used Splenda brown sugar which worked really well. Thanks for a keeper!

I didn't care much for these.  They were not as good as everyone made them out to be.  First I had a hard time getting the sauce to thicken up.  I ended up adding some cornstarch to it.  I really like the taste of sweet and sour meatballs with a pineapple flavor.  SO far out of all the meatball recipes I've tried I like Lana's sweet and sour meatballs the best.  Probally will not make these again.

these were amazing. i served them with pasta, but i probably should have gone with rice. i would definitely make the meatballs smaller next time, just bigger than half a golfball or something, because mine were about golfball size and they fell apart when i cooked them and took too long to brown. i would cut the sauce in half too, because there was a bunch left over.

What a great recipe!  I used 99% lean ground turkey and Italian style bread crumbs, and I added 1 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to the sauce.  Very, very good!

These are great. I made the sauce in a bowl and poured it over the meatballs and cooked them in the oven for 30 minutes at 350.I only used about 1/4 of the onion. The only problem I had, was the sauce wasn't thicking up after I took it out. So I put it in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes. It came out perfect. I served it over white rice. I still had some leftover sauce and I'm going to try it over some chicken. Very good meatballs.

Very good. This was the second time I made it and I made a few changes. I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup. Added a can of sliced mushroom and a carrot to the sauce. And used 1/4c dried chopped onion instead of a whole onion. Cooked the meatballs in the oven for 20 minutes and then brownded them. Made the sauce and then cooked the meatballs and the sauce in the oven for another 20 min.

I used rice vinegar instead of distilled.  And orange juice in place of water.  They were excellent with rice.  I made a second batch to freeze for a quick fixin' on a busy night.

I was really excited about this recipe, it looked good, it sounded good, turns out it was terrible! I seasoned up the meatballs giving them some flavor, and read a lot of the reviews on the sauce, picking up some good ideas. I cut the sugar by 25%. Turns out that was not even close to a large enough cut, the sauce was still like eating melted gummie bears! No wonder all those kids in the reviews loved it, it might be the sweetest thing I've ever eaten, deserts included! MAN! I really wanted this to be good, instead it wasn't edible by anyone over 12. Oh well...

These were the best sweet and sour meatballs. I baked my meatballs instead of frying them and I used white whine vinegar instead of white distilled. My sons & husband loved it.

Really good!  Made it using everyone's recommended modifications and will definitely make again.  I added 3Tbs. of milk with the bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, and 1/2 tsp. Siracha sauce to the meat mixture.  Reduced the onion to 1/2 small.  For the sauce, reduced brown sugar to 1/2 c. and soy sauce to 2 Tbs.  Added 1/3 c. ketchup, 1/4 tsp ground ginger,  1/2 tsp. dry mustard,  1 tsp Siracha sauce,  and 1 can drained pineapple chunks.  Used the juice of the pineapple plus enough chicken stock to make 1-1/2 cups for the water.  Used cornstarch instead of flour.  To make this a little easier and a one pot dish, I skipped browning the meatballs but placed the in a large skillet and baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  Out of the oven I placed the meatballs aside on a plate, skimmed the liquid left in the pan, about 1/2 cup, and the made the sauce in the same skillet.  Brought sauce to boil, added the meatballs and pineapple chunks, and then simmered for 10 minutes.  Easy and delicious.  Might double the sauce next time so there's plenty to go around with the rice.  Garnished with chopped green onions.

These were really good and easy. I did add salt and pepper to the meatballs and some ketchup to the sauce which made plenty. I did bake the meatballs while the sauce was cooking as they were very tender and I was afraid they would fall apart in the sauce Served over egg noodles with a salad. Will definitely make again.

Wasn't tangy at all, more of just a bland, sweet sauce.  Seasoning the meatballs with salt and pepper would help. In the future, I will refer to similar more flavorful recipes and reduce sugar to 3/4 c. and will add 1/2 c. vinegar total, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 c. of ketchup. and cornstarch instead of flour.

The only thing I did differently was add a little mustard powder to the sauce as others suggested. If I make these again, I'll season the meatballs before cooking them, as they were bland. The sauce is good, but still needed a little salt.

Made this recipe was very good but I made my meatballs with pork, 2 slices fresh bread, garlic powder, salt and pepper, and soya sauce as a binder instead of egg. To the sauce I added 3 tablespoons crushed pineapple and half a green pepper. It was great but I would half the brown sugar . was more sweet than sour

One thing I'd add for the rookie chef...
I made these in a crock pot so I just whipped together the sauce and dumped it over frozen meatballs to cook for 4 hours. I didn't realize that I needed to thicken the sauce! So I had to scoop out the meatballs and thicken the sauce, then re-pour over the meatballs. It wasn't a huge deal - simply a learning experience. I actually just made these again tonight and made sure to thicken the sauce first. The first time I had to use corn starch to thicken, tonight I made the recipe as is and it worked beautifully. Everyone loved them! Thanks so much!

I had 2 lbs of ground beef, so i decided to double the recipe. I started off making EXACTLY as written..but was skeptical on the amount of sugar, thinking it would be too sweet. so i only added 3/4 for a doubled recipe. For my tastes it was still to sweet and not enough sour. so i proceeded to try to make it more of our liking..adding 1/4 cup of ketchup and a huge squeeze of Dijon mustard..for some zip. Popped it all into the slow cooker, (after browning the meatballs) neat the end i gave them a taste, and still seemed like something was missing to me..honestly they were too sweet still. i added a HUGE dash of red chili pepper flakes..and it cooked it some more. That gave it that underlying spice to even out the sweet. Overall its a great starter recipe..and it would be great for those who like really sweet foods.

This was amazing. It didn't really have a sour flavour to it, but the sweetness from the brown sugar was all I needed! My family loved this recipe. I can't wait to make it again. I served it with steamed white rice and freshly chopped green onions on top.

The recipe was great but it was flat and I realized it was because the recipe omitted salt and pepper especially in the meatballs and I could kick myself for not realizing it earlier. I'll never do that again. Please add some salt and pepper unless you're concerned about a salt restricted diet, it can make a 3 star into a 5 star recipe!!

WOW...delicious sauce that made for a deliciously easy meal in the crock pot! I used 2 lbs frozen chicken teriyaki meatballs with pineapple (so good and easy), simmered the sauce ingredients on the stove for a few minutes to thicken, then combined all in crock pot on low 3-4 hrs.
Sauce Tips: 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 ketchup, 1/2 tsp ground mustard, salt and pepper. I also added 1/2 cup caramelized minced onions that really made it. Served with basmati rice

This recipe is so easy and the kids loved it! I used other reviewers' tips and used less brown sugar (1/2 c + 2 TB), used cornstarch instead of flour, and I added a touch of plum sauce, and they turned out super tasty! Next, I'll have to try it with pineapple chunks/juice. I used frozen Swedish meatballs - baked them in the oven then added them to the sauce. At first, I wasn't too sure about the sauce as it tasted more like homemade Hoisin sauce, but once the meatballs were added, it was perfect! This will become a regular staple in our house from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

My Fiancee loved these meatballs. I added a bit of ginger, sesame and shallot to the meatball mixture which really made a big difference.  These are definitely on our "make again" list

I enjoyed the sauce, but found that adding a whole onion (I used a medium sized onion) was entirely too much.  Next time I will use maybe half and onion and mince very fine or, as another reviewer mentioned, use onion flakes.

I pretty much followed the recipe. The meatballs  turned out bland and the sauce was too sweet; I personally didn't like how this dish turned out :\ I suggest looking through the many reviews with helpful tips before making these meatballs. Doubt I'll be using this recipe in future.

Five stars for the sweet and sour sauce.  I used frozen meatballs for a quick and easy meal.  I put the meatballs in right after I mixed the sauce ingredients and brought it all to a boil together.  Easy and Delicious!  Perfect for me with three little boys, one being a newborn: )  A new family favorite.

YUM! And so easy! I followed the reccomendation from another reader and baked in the oven for about 20 minutes on 350. Then poured the sauce on after. Was so good. No leftovers, I need to double the recipe next time! Thanks Kimmy!

I have made these a few times, now.  I just made them for New Year's Eve, and everyone loved them.  Someone said the sauce tastes similar to one for meatballs from our local Chinese restaurant.  I have to agree.  The only thing I might do a little different is add more liquid and breadcrumbs, less meat.  We like our texture a little different.  Overall very good.

The meat balls where really good (I substituted ground beef for ground turkey and put some garlic powder in the).  As for the sauce, it was yummy but a little on the sweet side so next time less brown sugar!

On short notice and in need of a yummy snackie type appetizer and using what I had in the cabinets...this was it...though I used frozen meatballs, only 2 tbsp of soy sauce and next time I think I will use corn starch because flour turned lumpy... simply delicious!   Had few left overs...even better the next day, we ate them cold on rolls...like baby meatloaf sandwiches...delish!!!

these were so good~!!  the sauce was easy, and i followed the adjustments listed in the other reviews.  the added crushed pineapple and red peppers made this VERY good and healthy!  think the sauce would be good with pork or chicken or a basting sauce for shrimp on the grill!!!  can't wait to experiment more and see what works!  thatnks for a get base recipe!

I used the meatball recipe from Cajun Appetizer Meatballs (though omitted the hot sauce and Cajun Seasoning) and baked the meatballs in the oven.  For the sauce, I used one cup of pineapple juice in place of some of the water and reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  I boiled the sauce, poured it over the baked meatballs and put it all in the oven for about twenty minutes.  I was overall pleased with the results though it did seem that a little something was missed from the sauce.

This was really greasy.  Did anybody catch the fact that you don't drain the fat off the meat because it just sits in the sauce to cook?  I'm sure it would have been better if I'd baked the meatballs first (as per the other reviews).  Not worth the calories as is.

After reading reviews I added 1/4 cup ketchup, more vinegar and used only 1/2 cup brown sugar.  We really liked this but agreed that a full cup of brown sugar would have been waaaayyyy to much for us.  Unless you like your sweet and sour meatballs really sweet I'd definitely not use a full cup.

i made these with turkey and they were awesome! Of course they were a lot more fragile and hard to handle while cooking because of how low turkey is in fat. So what i did was just put a couple tablespoons of oil on the skillet to help them stick together. i diced up onion, but next time i might try using dried onion flakes, i think it would make it even easier! thanks for the awesome recipe!

I have to say out of all the snacks and appetizers I made over the holidays these were not my favorite. I think it was the soy sauce in it that  I didn't like. Other people that I served these to said they were really good. So, that is not to say the recipe was bad, just not my taste.

I followed the recipe as it reads and was very satisfied with the results. I will definitely use the sweet and sour sauce to simmer other meats in.

I thought I was "above" this recipe...made it for my family one night when I had all the ingredients.  Turned out really great-- I added ketchup as others had done, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Great over white rice and paired with some steamed broccolli.

Took this to work and the meatballs were gobbled up!  To speed things up I used the TJ brand pre-made turkey meatballs.  I also used 1/4 cup less sugar, a squeeze of fresh lemon, 1 tsp of beef bouillon, 1 fat ring of fresh pineapple and apple cider vinegar instead of plain white.  I made the sauce in a pan and put the meatballs and sauce into the crock-pot on low for about 6 hours.  They were amazing.

These were a hit! Wish I would have read the reviews about cooking in oven to avoid them falling apart..and the onions probably should have been minced as they were too big and kept falling out.

Excellent...followed another reviewers advice with the 1/4 cup of ketchup and corn starch in place of flour....can't tell you how delicious they were.  My boyfriend raved about them not to mention he stood by the stove waiting for the timer to go off becaused they smelled so good.

This is my 2nd time making meatballs.  I had better luck with the 1st recipe that baked the meatballs.  With this one, my meatballs fell apart and were really ugly.  This might be my fault and not the recipe's fault.  But flavor was good - the sauce is good too.  Next time I think I will mince the onions or chop them up really fine - not diced, and I'll bake the meatballs, but good recipe and one I would make again.

Pretty good.  I also baked mine first so they wouldn't fall apart, and they didn't.  Followed the sauce directions exactly except for the brown sugar which I cut to 1/2c, it still turned out a bit too sweet for me (be sure to taste with a meatball, not by itself).  So I added 3T of ketchup, that definitely helped... then 1t of lemon juice (didn't notice much difference from that).  I had intended to add some Dijon or ground mustard, forgot - next time.  The sauce did thicken up nicely and there was enough for more meatballs.  I used flour and it was still glaze-like.  Flour must be added at the beginning though, before ingredients are heated, to avoid lumping (use cold water).  I'll probably make these again, I'm sure they would be a hit at a gathering.  UPDATE:  I reheated the leftover meatballs today and they were fabulous!  I was really surprised.  So maybe they just needed to cook longer, either in a crock pot or the oven.  Will try that next time.

Pretty good, but had to add a little ketchup and mustard to the sauce to give it a little more of the sweet and sour sauce. Served it over rice.

I added onion soup mix to the hamburger instead of onion. I don't think I'll ever make meatballs of any kind again without it!!! Super Yummy!! I served it with white rice, making it with chicken broth instead of water and adding some diced red, yellow, and orange peppers. A new favorite with the family!

I made my own meatballs and used the sauce from this recipe. It's DELICIOUS! I had to use rice vinegar instead of white vinegar since that's all I had and I threw in a dash of dijon mustard. Will definitely make again.

these were pretty good. i thought the sauce was a little too sweet so i added some lemon juice to even that out. the meatballs were so tender and yummy. my husband loved this. next time i think i will cut down on the sugar and possibly leave the flour out until the very end so it doesn't get sticky.

This was pretty tasty. I ate the whole thing by myself, in a bowl, not even bothering to serve it over rice. (I usually read all previous reviews before posting my own, but I'll skip the 177 previous reviews this time.) I used 96% lean ground beef, light brown sugar, and unbleached flour when I made this. The only minor hitch was that I used a medium-large white onion and it resulted in way too much diced onion for this recipe. I'd recommend a small (but not "pearl") onion. The amount of sauce might have been a little too much in proportion to the meatballs, for my taste, but it had a very nice sweet/sour taste, and thickened up well (have to make sure that the flour is thoroughly mixed in, though!). Quite a nice recipe, thanks.

This is really good, and the kids LOVE it. It is now on my regular schedule od week night dinner! easy to make. I work full time, so on sundays I will make the meatballs and freeze a bunch. The sauce is so easy to make that I have instant dinner. I serve it on a bed of rice with a green vegetable to add color.

This was tasty.  I like that there is no ketchup, because I don't like that tangy sweet taste.  I made them over mashed potatoes, and husband ate it up.  He still prefers the sauce from the cocktail meatball recipe.  Nice alternative to regular meatballs and tomato sauce.

My bf said this was "good", and I thought it was pretty good. I was expecting there to be garlic powder in the meatballs, not really sure why, but i left it out and followed the recipe exactly. I liked the sauce but i kept thinking it was missing something. I will make this again, just probably with a few tweaks.

These are very good! The only thing I did different is add pineapple and some pineapple juice to recipe. It is one of our favorites!  I also do not brown meatballs, but put them right into the liquid that is hot, bring to a boil and cover for 20 min and uncover for 10 minutes stirring often.

This was a bit too sweet for me.  I tasted the sauce and added some extra soy, vinegar and a little dry mustard and ketchup while cooking to try to cut through the sweetness a bit, but it wasn't enough.  The flavors are good and I think with some changes this might be great, but as is, it was just okay for us.

I used the frozen meatballs from Costco and added a 1/4 cup Ketchup to the Sweet and Sour. Then served it over Rice and baby peas.  My family loved it and I even got my picky 5 year old to eat it!

Sauce was really good; I usually make my meatballs with grape jelly and barbecue sauce--it makes a thicker marinade and coats the meatballs better.  However this recipe is good and tangy as well. Also I too added ketchup and corn syrup thereafter...pretty good!

I took someone's advice and added about 1/4 cup ketchup, a touch of honey and a little less brown sugar and just a squirt of dijon mustard.  Used cornstarch to thicken sauce and served over rice.  Hubby and I really loved it.  Next time I'll brown the meatballs in the oven to help keep their shape better.

I used the sauce and my fiance loves it!  If you don't mix the flour with water first before adding it will create lumps so make sure you do that before putting it in the pot with the rest of the ingredients.

This recipe came out perfect on the very first try!!! I took one person's advice and baked the meatballs in the oven on a cookie sheet rather than frying in a skillet and they were perfect and didn't break at all! Great advice! I substituted some Lipton's onion soup mix for the onion in the meatballs - gave it great flavour. I also made a few adjustments to the sauce - I reduced the amount of water, and only did 2/3 of the recommended amount of sugar, increased the amount of soy (accidentally doubled), used a combination of balsamic and rice-wine vinegar, and used cornstarch instead of flour. I also added garlic powder and ginger. I'm really happy with the way it turned out - nice and tangy!!!

I used pre-made meatballs from the store and simmered them along with the sauce for a half hour, then served them over noodles.  Great for a quick evening meal!

I made the recipe exactly as directed and it was okay. It wasn't a waste of ground beef, but it also wasn't spectacular. It tasted under-spiced. It could benefit from a small bit of salt, less onion and perhaps some red pepper flakes.

I was excited to find this one. The ingrediants are more of what I was looking for tonight. I was happy as well to see grape jelly was not a listed ingrediant as someone else mentioned. Sadly, I found that I was out of soy sauce, so I noticed in other recipes that people called for Worchester sauce, and that I did have. So that is what I used instead of the soy sauce. I had everything else. Now it turned out pretty good. I used ground turkey instead of beef, as usual, since I can't eat beef. I also added cornstarch for thickness, and I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I don't think it specified, but I used light brown sugar, and I'm thinking that I should've used dark brown sugar because the color of my sauce was much lighter than the one in the picture. Yes, I actually was wanted something darker in color. I think that I will skip the onions next time, otherwise dice them much smaller. I only used 1/4 of onion, and it seemed to be an over abundance of onion, and I am an onion fan. Over-all it was extremely yummy, my 7 year old said it was a keeper!

These were pretty good. The only complaint I have is that the meatballs completely fell apart in the skillet while browning. That also could've been my fault, but it still ended up sweet and sour mush instead of meatballs! The sauce was very flavorful, and my husband loved it, despite the appearance. I will try a few tweaks next time I make this dish.

I really wanted to love this since everyone seemed to rave about it, but I found them sort of bland.  I did add garlic as suggested and used corn starch instead of flour, but they didn't have enough flavor for my taste.  I may try them again, but will reduce the water and add extra soy sauce and vinegar to see if I can add to the flavor.  It's hard to explain, but they just weren't tangy enough.   Hmmmmmmm.  Wish they blew me away like they did the others.

The sauce was very tasty but the meatballs itself were just OK. It's great over white rice. The meatballs were slighty dry, maybe because I used super lean ground beef?

This was really good and a lot easier then I thought it was going to be. Sometimes meatballs can be a bit of a mission, but this was easy and tastey! I added garlic powder and fresh grated ginger to my meatball mixture and I think it really gave more flavor to the meat. I used lean ground beef and the meat came out a little dry. Next time I'll probably try meatloaf mix as some other members have suggested. This is going into rotation for sure! My DH doesn't really groove on sweet stuff for dinner, but he really enjoyed this!

I never let it reduce for the whole 30 minutes...only about 10, and then I put it in the crock pot for a few hours.  It is a huge hit and so easy!

This was a somewhat decent start, however, I found it too sweet so I added a little more vinegar and also added some dijon mustard.  This really made a HUGE difference.  I added about another 2 T. of vinegar and 2 T. of the dijon mustard.  It also helped to thicken it up some.  Next time I will try some barbecue sauce in it.  We were out of it this time.

So good! I too substituted pinapple juice for the water and even added a little juice to the meatballs. Next time I think I'll add green peppers and onions to the mix! The sauce ends up a little thick, I added a bit of water to loosen it up. Made it quite a few times and will continue to do so. Really good recipe

I made these for my husband. I don't eat meat. He doesn't really like the taste of sweetness on his meatballs, so he didn't like this too much. He thought they were good, but just not his thing. My mom however LOVED them! She said they were the best she'd ever tasted. She did suggest to use less sugar next time, as they were just a little too sweet. I will make this again! Thanks!

Although the sauce was nice, it was a bit too much after a few bites.  Also, the meatballs came out very chewy, although I followed the recipe.  Maybe it is because I defrosted the meat in a microwave?  I like my standard ginger-ale ketchup meatballs much better.  Thanks anyway though!

We did not really like this recipe. It was ok. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a can of crushed pineapple to the sauce as others suggested.

I loved this recipe it was so easy to make and you didn't have to go armed to the grocery store with a long list of items to purchase for it. My family liked it but being from the South would have preferred it to be just a little bit spicier. Next time I may add a bit of hot sauce to it.

These were pretty good, but extremely sweet-- I halved the sugar, and will probably reduce it further next time.  I also had problems getting them to stay together... I might add a little cornstarch next time.  Tasty, though!

Very easy to make.  My friends and son loved them.  I used frozen meatballs and placed all the ingredients in a crock pot, went to church two hours later came home and they were done.  Tastes good over rice.

this past weekend we threw two parties. at each event, a wine and cheese and a birthday party for our 4 year old, the meatballs were the most popular item. 

as suggested, we halved the brown sugar and added the pineapple. since we served the meatballs as appetisers, we speared them with toothpicks and a wedge of pineapple. fantabulous. before serving them we put aside a few (we made 100, all are gone!) and later gave them to our 2 year old triplets for dinner. they loved them as well. 

a HUGE hit whatever the occasion, and so easy to make.

The flavor was OK...then I added some pineapple juice and got the flavor just right. Thickened it with cornstarch and my husband said he enjoyed the meatballs very much. I did use pre-made meatballs from Sams Club...makes for a very simple meal.

I just used the recipe for the sauce and put some frozen premade meatballs in the pot to simmer.  Excellent!  I was looking for a recipe without ketchup, as no one in my house likes the "red" sweet and sour sauce.  Bravo!  The perfect sauce!

This was the best sweet and sour meatball recipe I've ever made.  The only change was to add 2 T of cornstarch to the sauce (mix with a small amount of sauce then add to remainder) so that it was thicker, and I added some ketchup.  I baked it in the oven as another reader suggested.  My family all loved it!

Excellent!  I love this recipe!  Not a lot of ingredients and everything was in my house.  I didn't have to make special trips to the store for missing ingredients!  The taste was awesome!   My husband was a bit disappointed there weren't any leftovers.  He wanted to take some to work for lunch.  Next time I will have to double the recipe!  Didn't change a thing! Thanks!

The sauce was pretty good, but I found that the flour did not thicken it very well. Next time I will use cornstarch. I also added a drained can of pineapple. A good recipe.

Very good! Added a little salt and pepper to the meat, then baked in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes, before draining the fat, pouring the sauce over and baking (uncovered) for 30 more minutes. For the sauce, substituted 1.5T cornstarch for the flour, and added a little pineapple, green pepper, pineapple juice, and honey. Ate with white rice made with leftover juices from a pork roast added to the cooking water. Top notch dinner!

much better than the store bought meatballs and sauce. They had a very good taste. I served them over white rice and they were a great hit. I made them ahead of time and then kept the sauce and meat seperate until ready to boil after I got home! Great Recipe!!!

I made this dish almost exactly as written. I was out of bread crumbs, so I used instant potato flakes and some oatmeal. That worked just fine. My husband couldn't get enough of this dish, and had seconds - which is unusual for him. Will definitely make this again!

My family loves these!  I do add ketchup to the meatball recipe and some to the sauce as well.  I also use cornstarch instead of flower.  I just make the sauce in a saucepan and then mix with the cooked meatballs and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes!

I made these and we did not enjoy them. Way too sweet and non existant sour. Other than really sweet, they were very bland, so i added some red pepper flakes but it didn't help much.  They're edible, but I won't make again.

The sauce was really quite good - exactly what I expect from sweet and sour meatballs. I did add salt and pepper to the meat because there was a distinct lack of flavouring in this recipe. I used ground veal because I didn’t have beef, but it functions similarly, it’s just milder. Unfortunately the amount of onion called for in this recipe is about four times too much. I used half a large onion and it was twice as much onion as needed! I otherwise followed the recipe and my meatballs almost entirely fell apart in the browning and then sauce-boiling process. Still tasted great on rice but if you were expecting hold-together meatballs drop the onion, up the breadcrumbs and egg, and consider baking instead of frying.

Absolutely amazing. I doubled the recipe as I has 2lbs of beef. Added around 1/4 cup ketchup to the sauce and it was great! 
It is quite sweet! May cut back a bit on the brown sugar next time.

Made 4 cups of rice and it fed 5 adults and 1 toddler.

Really good easy to make sauce.  Like others I used premodern meatballs.  I added a tbsp sriracha chili sauce, and a dash of garlic along with 1/4 c ketchup.  All in all I found it was pretty spot on with the sweet n sour flavor.  Will use again.

I really liked this, it isn't overwhelmed with tomato flavor like most S&S meatball  recipes I've found.  I followed the recommendations for changes: added onion soup mix to the meat in place of the onion, seasoned the meat with s&p and garlic powder, I cut brown sugar by half, added 1/2 can of crushed pineapple to the sauce, I thickened the sauce by mixing cornstarch in with some of the pineapple juice.  I also added 6 shakes of Tabasco and a couple T ketchup to the sauce.  I browned the meatballs on med-high then put them in a casserole dished and poured the sauce over them.  I baked them at 400 F for 15 min covered with foil, then 15 min without foil.  Thanks for the recipe and for all the great suggestions.

This dish was straightforward to prepare, and tasted great.  It is a bit time consuming to prepare.  Once the meatballs are browning, I suggest starting the sauce, bringing it to a low boil and continuing to stir.  Once the meatballs are done, add to the sauce and keep cooking.

Just followed other reviews and switched corn starch for the flour and added 1/4 cup of ketchup. Husband thought it was quite good, but asked if I could use the sauce for chicken instead of meatballs - just his personal preference.
Thought it was very tasty, which is great since I was testing the recipe for a pot luck where I was asked to bring sweet and sour meatballs and didn't have a recipe.

Made the sauce on its own for a different meatball recipe. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1/4 cup ketchup for extra tang. Cooked the sauce over low heat, stirring constantly, for a looooooooooong time to get the right consistency without lumps. Worth it.

It tasted great,  but the meatballs wouldn’t hold together very well.  I had to use gluten free options.  I’m wondering if the fat content of the beef helps hold them together? The ground beef I used was lean, maybe 95%.

I made the recipe as per the directions and ingredients and did not like it at all. Ideas to make it better: 1/2 onion, 2 Tablespoons distilled white vinegar, and maybe an extra egg. The meatballs kept falling apart because there was too much onion. The meat was very good, but we didn't like the sauce at all. We didn't hate it, but didn't love it. We won't be making it again, but are glad we tried it. Thank you for the recipe.

I loved how easy this recipe was to make with ingredients that I already had in my pantry.  I served it with rice.  I think it would also be good with chicken instead of meatballs.  I will definitely be making again!

Followed ingredients as stated where this was my first time in making meatballs.  Meatballs were more sweet than sour with a good but not outstanding taste.  The next time I make this I will add some additional  seasonings in the hope of putting more flavor into this recipe.

I added a little cornstarch to thicken it quicker and add gloss. I also reduced the onion by half.  Very tasty!

Delicious!  Added a few red pepper flakes for a little bite.  Didn’t have bread crumbs so I used oatmeal.  Also cut back on the brown sugar and it was still sweet enough.

Had these for dinner last night.  And I was totally surprised in the flavor and the ease of making this dinner.  I served these over white rice with some stir fry vegetables on the side.  And to my surprise there were no left overs!  I would definitely recommend this recipe for anyone who is trying to make meatballs for the first time.

I used store-bought frozen meatballs and cooked them in the oven first. Made the sauce as directed, and we LOVED it! The second time, I added a little bit of ketchup as others have suggested, and we loved that too! I would consider it a teriyaki meatball.

I will definitely make again but the recipe just does not need all the sugar.  I cut the brown sugar in half and it was still very good.  Also,  I also use low sodium soy sauce and frozen onions (I tend to cut up an entire onion and then freeze what I don't need so it is always recipe ready) as the frozen onion cooks up faster and you don't have hard pieces in the meatball.  I also used corn starch as was recommended by another as it is more common in Asian dishes.

Sauce was very watery, and lacked in flavor. I had to add dry mustard and Ketchup to add flavor, I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

I decided to try a new recipe and it turned out pretty good. After reading some of the comments I decided to tweek it a little and add 1/4 cup ketchup, 1 1/2 bell peppers and 1 large can pineapple, and instead of the 1 1/2 cup water I used 1 cup pineapple juice and 1/2 cup water. I served it with rice and It turned out really well! My family scarfed it down! Could be a new favorite.

I just made this using Aidell's Chicken Hawaiian Meatballs from Costco. Super easy sauce and everyone (including picky son) loved it!  I did make some changes; I substitute cornstarch for flour. I also added 1/4 cup of ketchup (as suggested), 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 Tblsp of Sirracha sauce, 1 tsp of Cholula hot sauce, 1 cup of strained pineapple chunks, topped with chopped green onions and chinese noodles. I will definitely make this again and really appreciate the basic recipe! :)

I had to make mine gluten free for our company, but it was super easy with the suggestions.  I also trippled the recipe, so by tripling all the amounts, I also added one can of pineapple tidbits, counting the juice towards the water.  Instead of an onion, I used epicures onion dip mix.  I used gluten free crackers instead of bread crumbs.  I baked my meatballs in the oven. Then for the sauce I used corn starch and I added ketchup.  I boiled the sauce, then poured it over my meatballs and cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 4-5 hours.   They were amazing, I’ll most definitely be using this recipe just for the meat balls plain as well!

Neither sweet or sour. Bland and watery.  Sorry not good as written. Meatballs were bland and not tender.  Maybe with some of the suggestions it might be good.  But I will not make again.

Delicious!  I cheated though by using premade frozen meatballs.  I combined the sauce with a few alterations:  I used cornstarch in place of the flour, added 1/4 c ketchup, added some cut pieces of fresh pineapple, then cooked the sausce in a large saucepan.  Once thickened, I added the frozen meatballs and simmered for approx 15-20 minutes, or until the meatballs were fully thawed and heated throughout.   Served over steamed rice.  Yummy!!!

It's unfair for me to review this recipe because I did not make it as is. The ingredients the recipe lists and the ingredients I had on hand varied. I used ground turkey (96/4), apple cider vinegar, 1 c brown sugar, and 1 c white sugar with 1 T molasses. They turned out great so if your ingredients you have on hand aren't exact, you can definitely substitute and it'll turn out awesome. I'd really like to play with the recipe now and see what I can come up with!

Everyone loved this recipe. I added black pepper and didn't have onions so put onion powder. Served broccoli on the side. Will be making again! Pretty easy.

I made this for Christmas 2016 dinner only in the gluten free version (gluten free flour) it hit a five star with my whole family (hard to please)  including the ones that will never eat gluten free food! I even had to print the recipe out for them!

Due to myself having Celiac Disease I make all my food gluten free.

They so much enjoyed, after every one ate I told them it was gluten free and all of them were totally shocked!!  Ha, Ha!!

Super easy to make. As with most I adjusted to my tastes added yellow mustard to cut the sweetness down and added Sesame seeds. I also used frozen meatballs for a quicker meal, served over rice and added veggie and done! Everyone liked it even my 17 month old!!

I was NOT expecting this to turn out how it did, it was soooo good! We are low on groceries so I was looking for a simple recipe to fit what we currently have. I did add maybe 2 TBSP of ketchup (would have done 1/4 cup but we're out) and I did not have breadcrumbs or bread so I substituted with 1/4 cup of rolled oats (probably made it healthier actually!) My only complaint was that it was not very sour, mostly sweet, and I like my sweet and sour to have some bite to it (acidic wise, not spice wise). I think next time I will use a little more vinegar or cut down on the sugar (more leaning towards the vinegar, not afraid of that stuff).

Update: I use a little over half a cup of vinegar now (3/4 cup?) and it is perfect! I also mix the sauce in a baking dish and cook the meatballs in the sauce in the oven, 425 for 50 minutes. I skim the fat off the top when done if using 80% ground beef, but lean is optimal for this method.

This was pretty darned good! The whole family liked it. It was also easy to make and has ingredients that you are likely to have already. Next time (and there will be a next time), I will add some fresh pineapple and bell peppers to the sauce.

We liked the basic recipe and made some changes from the ideas of others.  I cut down on the sugar, added soy sauce, added fresh pineapple chunks, and doubled all of the sauce ingredients.   It was good and we had neighbor  over to eat with us and she said it was great.

Excellent! My kids loved it, I used store bought meatballs instead of making my own because lack of time and it was still delicious.

I made this just the way as it's written. If you have read my other posts, you know it's important to me to make it as advertised or, it's not really their recipe. That being said, this is a keeper but I do have to say the next time I think I'll fry the onions slightly before I add them to the meatballs so the onions aren't so tough in the middle of the meat balls and maybe add a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to give it a little smokey flavor. My family did definitely enjoy these over mixed rice.

The best recipes use few ingredients and time & temp are
Key to success. I didnt use my meatballs, used small cheap
Frozen & deli $.80/ea fresh, cooked in toaster oven @350 til
Cruchy. Lots of people said too sweet/ sour i used light
Brown  sugar, lachoy lite soy, added the meatball fat and
It was great easy and a quick tasty meal, better as leftovers
Even cold ! Also used corn starch,  lots of possibilities for
Each use, ribs, chicken, etc.. Good basic recipe will use
Christmas !

The sauce was delicious, but the meatballs were a little bland.  I think next time I'll mix a little of the sauce into the meatballs before cooking.

I live in Germany and the brown sugar here is like almost white. So I used almost black dark brown sugar from the Netherlands. That made the sause very dark and rich. It was a big hit with the husband and I took the leftovers to lunch the next day and shared them with my coworker. 
I will make this again..

Very tasty! I followed the recipe as written except I added a few spices to the burger and added a little ketchup to the sauce.  The sauce thickened up almost too much so I added just a bit more water and voila!  
Thanks for sharing your recipe

I followed but did use coconut sugar. I don't have brown sugar in my kitchen (ever). It was maybe just a bit too sweet, depends on personal taste.  Oh.....almost forgot, I used ground lamb ....ok, guess I didn't follow the recipe did I LOL

I had printed out the recipe but lost  it, so I tried to recall all the ingredients.  Grated some French bread tor crumbs, added some grated  onion.  parsley,  and guessed at the sauce proportions but it all came out very nicely,   My husband loved them with white rice and green beans.

Delicious; well way to apply hamburger meat.

Positive developed from scratch.  No you can go to the supermarket and just pick up the sweet and sour already made to serve.

I made suggested  changes, that I read in other reviews.  I reduced the brown sugar by half, used beef broth instead of water, and  added ketchup.  As rewritten the recipe is a good basic for others to build on, as everyone's tastes are not the same.  Will be making it again.

The meal was a smashing success and there wasn't many leftovers but I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars because I had to make to many adjustments to the sauce. To me you should be able to make the recipe just like it is written and enjoy it, and if you want to tweak it,it should be very minimal. Reading the reviews most of the trouble lies with the sauce.

To be honest I used this recipe as a guide.  I used pepperidge farm corn bread stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs, I baked the meatballs for 30 min at 350 before browning them in a pan, and I deglazed the pan with cooking wine and poured that into my sauce.  My family said this was the best meal I had cooked since my cooking dry spell!

I usually try it by the book initially and then modify later depending upon my "mood". However ;  this recipe must be followed exactly or you'll likely be disappointed.

Used cornstarch instead of flour, made 2/3 of the sauce.  Added vegetables.

I followed peoples tips and added corn starch along with ketchup, pinapple juice, and my own idea of siracha sauce.  This was my first time making meat balls and I didn't realize that it takes some technical skill. ALthough the flavor was great, the meat balls turned basically into a pot of mush, with the exception of  half the meat still in ball form.

4.5 stars.  My husband really liked these a lot.  I added a few more spices like onion powder, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, fresh parsley.  And I baked them in the sauce at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  I will make them again.

I really wish I'd read the reviews more before I made these!  I love sweet things (like my username says), but these were WAY,  WAY  too sweet!!  I did add some ketchup, as I saw mentioned, along with adding some garlic powder and Worchestershire sauce, for an added bit of "savory".   I honestly don't think there was enough sugar in the bit of added ketchup to account for all the extra sweetness, and the garlic powder and Worchestershire should have counteracted it.  I'll make these again, but with only half the brown sugar and the same additions.  And will probably use frozen meatballs, since they hold together a lot better than homemade - my meatballs were very fragile.   Or as someone else suggested, soft bread crumbs with milk added.

I made this recipe exactly as written, aside from doubling it. My family really enjoyed it and there were no leftovers. In the future I would probably add some pineapple and green pepper to the sauce. It's a great weeknight recipe though since it's so easy.

I used LLCHOW'S review suggestions plus added a can of pineapple tidbits and 1/4 cup ketchup. I used frozen sirloin meatballs, heated in the oven then added to the sauce and simmered. Next time I will try the slowcooker. My family loved them and asked when I would make them again.

My family loved it! I made my own bread crumbs from Gluten Free bread. It is high in sugar content, so I may try using pineapple juice like another reviewer did.

This recipe was really really good!!! I was not expecting it to be so flavorful and mouth wanting more! I highly recommend adding the 1/4C Ketchup and replace the flour with cornstarch. I saved about 1/4 C of my onions and threw those in with the sauce while cooking as well. Other than those very minor changes and doubling the recipe (a must!!!), this recipe was made as is!  Note: Add a stir fry vegetable mix (or same veggies fresh, but slightly steamed already) to the the sauce just after you add the meatballs in and let that mix simmer with the meatballs. Serve the entire thing over rice and you won't regret it ! (unless your a veggie hater of course :-) )

I loved this. I added garlic powder to the meatballs, used only 2/3c of brown sugar, and added 1.5tbsp of ketchup. Go good over rice. Unfortunately my husband said he was not a fan.

Loved this! I took heed of the comments about it being mighty sweet, which some people like--but I am getting tired of loads of sugar being added to everything. So I cut the sugar by a third, and next time I'll use half. I used ground goat meat and mixed with ground beef chuck. Squirted in some Sriracha sauce and a few dashes of cayenne pepper for kick.  The "Billy Goat Balls" are a big hit, ha ha!
BTW the photo that's up there now can't be right, as the sauce comes out a nice caramel color--no tomatoes in this recipe.

Tasted great! I subbed a little with things I had around.  When making the meatballs I used onion flakes and added a dash of salt and pepper. For the sauce I used pineapple juice instead of water and Worcestershire for soy sauce (about half as much as called for.) I added some powdered mustard as well and finally subbed cornstarch for the flour.  I liked the taste and my family enjoyed it.  Served with steamed rice and broccoli and it was better than take out!

This recipe I tried firstly as written, and was not really impressed.  There was a sort of floury taste.....and I  did cook them properly.  The second time I made it I used cornstarch as the thickening ingredient, and added the three tablespoons of ketchup and a can of pineapple chunks.  The family liked them much more.

Good starting point! I used cornflake crumbs in my meatballs (what I had on hand), added a can of pineapple chunks (using the juice in place of some of the water) and increased the vinegar to 1/3 cup. Also used cornstarch to thicken instead of flour.

This was sooo good.  I did 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of a whole cup and it was still more sweet than necessary.  I also added yellow/orange (or red bell) pepper to the sauce.  The meat balls where so delicate they were hard to brown without breaking them up.  I might add just a little more bread crumbs next time.  I also cut out 1/2 cup water for a thicker sauce.  Mmmmwha! Loved it served over rice!

Ir was good but I expected a more sweet and sour taste. It just tasted sweet.  I will make it again though.

I will admit I changed this to appease my taste. I don't  necessarily care for a sweeter sauce. I prefer less sweet. However, that is MY taste. This dish is fantastic either way. If you like sweet than follow the recipe to a T. If you're like me than reduce the sugar by about half. My suggestion would be to simply taste the sauce in the mixing bowl before putting it in the pan. I also added ketchup to the sauce based on other reviewers & that was delicious. Alone this recipe is 5 stars & tweaked to your own personal tastes it is also 5 stars! Good, easy, yummy, solid recipe.

The meatballs were bland, the suggest using onion powder rather than onions the onions don't form well. The sauce was also way too sweet more sweet than sour. I had to double my vinegar so next time is cut the sugar in half. Ill also try using apple cider vinegar rather than regular.

This was alright but I feel like it needs some tweaking. I added 1/4C ketchup as one review suggested but this recipe was still missing something. I also would make sure the onion is FINELY chopped or just added to the sauce next time. I also added a bag of mixed veggies ( broccoli, snow peas, carrots, water chestnuts).

Great Recipe! I have a 2.5 year old so I used a magic bullet to puree the onion instead of dicing,added dried parsley, and garlic powder in with the bread crumb,egg and onion. Also I cooked the meatballs in the oven. I had to add a little extra bread crumb to the mixture to keep it together because of the onion being runny.

I also substituted the flour with corn starch, I used palm vinegar (which may not be accessible to all) but I like its mellow and tart flavor better. Overall this was a delicious recipe!!

I reduced Brown sugar to 1/2 cup and used 1 1/2 cups pineapple juice instead of water. Very yummy. Baked meatballs in oven for 30 minutes then put all in crock pot keep warm until dinner. Very good recipe. Will make again.

I'm so glad that I found this recipe.  I was looking for a recipe for Sweet & Sour meatballs that was made without ketchup or chili sauce.  I substituted some of the water for pineapple juice and it was delicious.

Just a tad too much soy for my liking. Other than that, it was amazing. I hand rolled over 300 meatballs so I quadrupled this recipe. Served them at a baby shower to 45 people and everybody raved about how different the meatballs were. There were no leftovers so I think that's a good sign... Right?

Tweaks: Added 1 green capsicum, chunkily cut, one onion, quartered then layers separated, carrot sliced into circles, small can of pineapple pieces natural juice included. 
Followed the other comments, and used 1/2 cup + 2 tbs brown sugar, doubled the vinegar and added the 1/4 cup tomato sauce. Turned out great.

This recipe was pretty good. I followed the suggestions of others and cut the brown sugar in half, and subbed the flour for corn starch. 1 1/2 tbsp. When I tasted, the sauce wasn't quite sweet enough so I added a few tbsp. of white sugar, which got it to where I wanted it. The sauce was missing something, and I liked the idea of the pineapple, but didn't have any. So, I added about 1/2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar. It gave the sauce just what it needed. The whole family liked it, I will be making this again.

I used chicken teriyaki meatballs, but this is a fantastic sweet & sour sauce! I used apple cider vinegar and added chopped pineapple and diced peppers during the simmer. A keeper, and easily adaptable.

Very tasty.  We really enjoyed this very quick and easy to prepare recipe.  The only difference, we used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and followed the remaining instructions to the T.  I well certainly make again. Thx

Delicious! I made it exactly as specified but browned the meatballs first and also baked the whole thing for about half an hour at the end. Next time I will probably use half the brown sugar and sub beef broth for the water but I will DEF make this again! Thanks for a yummy one!

Absolutely delicious! I did more of the cooking of the meatballs on the skillet. I also added a bit of cornstarch to make the sauce thicker. I boiled the sauce and THEN added the meatballs. I also put the onions in the sauce as opposed to in the meat. Will definitely be making this again!

I'm in the process of making these meatballs and I'm not sure if I'm just not reading between the lines but my meatballs completely crumbled either while I was "browning" them or while "stirring often" in the sauce. What am I missing?? Smells delicious though!!!

This recipe is fantastic.  I would advise using low fat turkey instead of beef and draining the water/fat as you cook them first.  Then add all the other ingredients and I add barbeque sauce for the tang you need in them because I saw that in another recipe for Sweet  and Sour meatballs and think that is what it needs!

I doubled the vinegar and bread crumbs, added salt and an extra egg to the meatballs.  Turned out delicious - just as I was hoping for.

I wanted to make sweet and sour meatballs for dinner but didn't have what I needed for my usual recipe so I went looking for a recipe that I did have everything for. I decided to give this a try and was glad I did. I made my own meatballs but followed the sauce recipe exactly as it is written. My whole family loved it! And that includes an extremely picky 4 year old, a somewhat picky 3 year old and a 9 month old baby. It was a hit and I will definitely be making it again! Thanks for posting :)

This recipe is so good! I feel the sauce can virtually work with any type of meat. I substituted the beef with very lean turkey, and the distilled white vinegar with garlic infused red wine vinegar, and also added 1/4 cup of ketchup to the sauce. I also made my own breadcrumbs, adding lemon pepper to it. It is delicious!!

If I've used the amount of sugar listed, for sure this would've been more sweet. Glad I halved the sugar as others suggested and added 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard. I also added a tablespoon of ketchup and will probably add more the next time and play with it.

So many of these reviews are based on major changes, but I don't think this recipe needs changes. It is really good as written. To me it is comfort food meets sweet and sour. I do suggest that you flavor the ground beef to your personal taste. A hint for keeping your meatballs from falling apart: When you are rolling them, don't force any onions into the meatball. Let the excess onions fall into the bowl as you roll the meatballs, and that will give you a good consistency. I didn't have any problems with them falling apart. We will definitely be making this again!

These were delicious! To the meatballs I used bread instead of bread crumbs and also added some Ken's Honey Teriyaki Marinade and a clove of chopped garlic. To the sauce I added some of the Ken's marinade, allspice and ketchup as another reviewer suggested. I'll definitely make these again. I made them with the recipe- White and Wild Rice Pilaf.  They were great together.

I made the sauce exactly like the recipe said; the only thing I did differently was I cooked the sauce for about 5 minutes to thicken it. I used frozen meatballs (beef, about 28 meatballs in the bag; the sauce covered all of them with and then some!), and put everything in the crock pot for about an hour and a half. It thickened up a little more, and was pretty good!  My friends all said they liked it as well.  I will make this again, and next time I might try adding some ketchup, like one reviewer suggested.  Overall, a good recipe.

This recipe did not work for me. My meatballs turned out to be tough and the meat needs salt and pepper. The sauce did not help to flavor the bland meatballs.

Made this sauce with frozen meatballs for a fast meal over rice  The only things I did different were to add some garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  I would definitely make again.  Thanks the recipe!

Made this recipe for our daughters bridal shower. It went over very well. Only made the sauce as I have my own meatball recipe. The sauce was sort of plain when made as described but I added about 2 cups of fresh chopped pineapple. That added the needed flavor and sweetness.  I made this recipe times 4.

Love the sauce! I made my own recipe for the meatballs and simmered them in the sauce just as written. WONDERFUL! I have made other sweet and sour sauce recipes from this site before and was not happy with them. They were always too sweet for my taste but this one is spot on. Thanks for sharing it.

I used meatballs I had made and cooked ahead of time and then froze (much cheaper and healthier than store bought frozen meatballs).  Heated them up in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes and followed the rest of the instructions, with the addition of about 1/4 cup of ketchup, as suggested by another reviewer.   Served it with brown rice and a vegetable.  My entire family LOVED this, especially the sauce.  My husband is never really excited about anything I make, but he went on and on about how good this was.  It will definitely be a regular in my rotation.  Making the meatballs ahead of time and freezing them makes this a pretty quick/easy meal too, which is always a plus!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make! I added 1/4 cup of ketchup and also a dash of red pepper flakes, but I would add a little more red pepper flakes next time. I had mine over rice with a side of stir fried veggies, my husband had his in a sub roll.

I thought it was alright, they could definitely use more flavor/seasoning.  This was my first time making meatballs, and I think it should really say "minced" onions instead of diced, I ended up with huge chunks of onion (I should have noticed before mixing in, but I'm a first-timer!).  It was just OK, not great.

10+ for a lot of us....why havent I found this one sooner! Delicious and so easy. I made my meatballs the night before and stored in the fridge. I also doubled the recipe! Next day I put the cold meatballs in my crockpot. Made the sauce which I doubled everything EXCEPT the brown sugar! I used 1c. total ....I also added 1/4c. of ketchup. Dont skimp the process of making the sauce on the stove and letting it come to a boil. This thickens and turns this sauce into a wonderful thick and glossy glaze. After a full boil, I added my sauce to the crockpot and meatballs. Turned on low for a few hours. Let me tell you how very tender these were and how flavorful the glaze was. All the meatballs were gone by the end of the night...everyone loved them.  One other tip....I baked my meatballs...did not fry. Thanks!

Kids loved it, made with frozen meatballs (not italian) pineapple juice instead of water, and pineapple chunks.  I served it on rice.  I think it would be even better with chopped onions and green peppers.

I would give this a 5 for ease of preparation and amount of ingredients, but only a 4 for the sauce.  I will definitely make this again, but next time I will use the sauce from Waikiki Meatballs because I like it much better--seemed a bit better balance between sweet and sour, plus I love the pineapple and peppers.  Will definitely use this recipe for the meatballs, though!

Top notch! I didn't have any onions on hand, so I substituted minced garlic for onions, and they were delicious!

This was very,very good! I loved the taste, and the ease of making it. First recipe I've found in a long time where I actually had all the ingredients.  The only complaint I have is that it made a ton of the sauce, but not enough meatballs. Easy fix!

I make this frequently.  My kids absolutely love it.  It is pretty sweet though.  I tried adding a few squirts of ketchup after reading some reviews and thought it helped to cut some of the sweetness a bit.   I also cheat and buy frozen meatballs.

Made these for my daughters Baptism and got rave reviews! It was all gone and I had made two batches. The sauce was so easy and not too sweet. I will make this again when I have a large group over.

Bland.. I had to REALLY spice up the recipe to give it an exciting flavor.  The sauce was very runny.  I followed the recipe exactly as listed.. not a fan, made my own changes.  Turned out pretty good, everyone loved them... but I'm giving it a 3 because I had to add so much to make them good.

I added yellow and green peppers also canned pineapple. I can not imagine this dish without them. Also the meat needs salt and pepper. Sauce was delicious.

We absolutely love this recipe. The only change I have made is that I use onion flakes instead of fresh onion. It was great the night you make it and really great as a left over. It's almost like having dessert as a meal.YUM!

Exactly what I was looking for. I was able to feed a pack of hungry cub scouts and got great compliments.  I rolled the meatballs to the size of large marbels, about 5lbs of ground beef and they were gone before I knew it and had 6 requests for the recipe.  thanks

This was a good meatball recipe, although not exactly as I thought it would be.  It reminded me more of a spare-rib style sauce than "sweet-and-sour".  I would make it again but perhaps cut back on the brown sugar and add some pineapple as others have suggested.

These meatballs were awesome!!!  I will definately be making them again!  I didn't have an onion on hand so I used 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  I also used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup and they were perfect.  YUMMY!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was great!  I used a little less than a cup of brown sugar, but other than that I followed the recipe completely.  I served the meatballs over white rice.  Very filling and yummy!  I will definitely make this again.

I went to a party for a friend who was serving sweet and sour meatballs.  I came straight home and found this recipe.  They are so delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.
