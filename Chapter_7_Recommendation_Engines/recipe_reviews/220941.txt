I followed this recipe exact, only adding a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and using mini-chocolate chips. I made muffins out of this recipe instead of one big loaf. I did not get 12 muffins, I got 11. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at exactly 20 minutes. These turned out PERFECT--moist, flavorful with a great combination of ingredients. Awesome snack muffin.

Moist and not overly rich.  An excellent variation of a classic.

This was amazing! I just loved it. I made mine with 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar because that's all the brown sugar I had. Also, I didn't have the yogurt so I used what I had which was sour cream. It was delicious!

This was yummy!! I doubled the recipe and used whole wheat pastry flour, creamy peanut butter and one extra banana. It turned out very moist, hubby loved it. I will definitely make this again.

Our absolute favorite way to use old bananas. Have made this now with sour cream and with yogurt. Sour cream is by far the winner. We also use less sugar (about 1/2C of brown sugar) and I substitute the oil for apple sauce strait across. We usually double and make a pan of 12 muffins and one loaf of bread. The muffins cook in our convection oven for 25 min and the loaf usually 45-50. Love this one and almost have it memorized!

These were the best muffins we've ever eaten.  My husband asked me if I was sure they were good for us!  Have never left a review before, but just had to leave my comments for these.  The only problem I have is if I can wait for breakfast each morning.

Very good recipe, unfortunately I could not taste the peanut butter. The bread tasted great anyway and my guests gobbled it up.

I didn't have chocolate chips, so I added a large box of instant chocolate pudding & pie filling and cut the flour down to 3/4 c.  I also substituted 1 tbs butter for the oil.  Everything else I did as written and the bread came out great.  It tasted more like cake than banana bread.  It definitely doesn't need butter on it and can be eaten plain.

Amazing! I didn't have plain fat-free yogurt so used fat-free greek yogurt instead.  I ran out of whole wheat flour so used half all purpose flour and that batch came out even better!  So good, in fact, that I entered it into a banana bread bake off at church and won!  The absolute best banana bread ever!

This bread was great considering it's a healthier alternative to your standard banana bread. I was really hoping to taste the peanut butter, but not even a hint of it came through. I added 1/8 cup coconut milk instead of 1/4 cup yogurt since I don't eat dairy and replaced the oil with applesauce. It was gobbled up right away at work.

Incredible recipe! Added appr. 2 Tbs cinnamon and used less than 1/4 cup c.chips. Subbed almond butter. So delicious and very healthy for a sweet snack. Next time will omit oil as bread was plenty moist. Anxious to try with pumpkin or grated apple as I plan on using this recipe frequently- nice to have a treat and not feel guilty!

I was so pleased with this recipe. YUM! Peanut butter is a great addition to banana bread. I used creamy peanut butter. Swapped out the yogurt with sour cream. Used milk chocolate chips. This bread took just over 60 minutes to bake for me. Definitely will be baking this again.

This is the best dessert bread ever! We decided to try it out for a dessert potluck my husband was attending along with another banana bread recipe. The other banana bread was tasty, but after trying this one I don't want to finish the other one. It just pales in comparison.  I just finished baking another loaf of this amazing bread to bring in to work. From now one, this is the only banana bread I will ever bother making!

This is so good! Super moist and tasty. I used raisins instead of chocolate chips, otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Delicious!

This is awesome!!! I've made it for a breakfast cake/bar and as a snack cake and both staff and campers really love it. It's great for breakfast with the protein of yogurt and peanut butter (although I usually make it with Sun Butter due to allergy concerns.) I like using mini chocolate chips- distributes the chocolate flavor better and not too sweet.

Just made it. Buried in 24 inches of snow that won't stop here in Taunton Ma. This recipe is great. Can smell the peanut butter while baking. Great and healthy too. Did add cinnamon per someone's review. Thanks

Yum, this bread is delicious! Those are just a couple good things my sisters had to say about this recipe. I LOVE, LOVE banana bread, but dont get to make it often because none of my sisters like it. Until now! They ate it up for lunch and didn't have them complain once! (They even helped make it!) Here is what i did differently; I used 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips, added 1 tsp. vanilla extract, omitted the oil, baked at 325 degrees for about 47 minutes, and poured the batter into a 9-inch cake pan (to make it fun!)There was also enough to make one mini loaf. Perfect texture, rose nicely, easy, and best of all, even the pickiest of eaters will enjoy this bread!

I made this recipe and it is delicious! I made one following the recipe and one with a few small changes. i used 1/2c creamy peanut butter, 1/4 cup sour cream instead of yogurt (all I had), added 1 tsp vanilla. you can get away with using less sugar but I don't recommend it. I also used mini choc chips (and only 1/3 cup) as I didn't want the chocolate to take over the other flavors.

This was absolutely decadent and delicious.  The recipe is also versatile enough to be modified to suit your tastes. I'm on a low sodium diet - so used zero sodium baking powder and soda and added no salt. My peanut butter was all natural no salt added. Per other reviewers suggestions, I added a teaspoon of vanilla, half a teaspoon of cinnamon,  and half a cup chopped pecans, I also soaked half a cup of raisins in warm water for 10 minutes, strained and added them as well. 

The banana, peanut butter, raisin, chocolate pecan mix complimented each other superbly and I'm going to have a difficult time not eating this all at once :D

This was so good! I used regular crunchy peanut butter and low-fat yogurt, and added 1 tsp of vanilla; it came out so moist and flavorful.  I’ll be making this again :-)

The only change I made was to add 3/4 Cup of toasted walnuts, otherwise followed recipe exactly. It came out great! Simple and delicious, I will be making this again, probably many many times. Yum! Thanks for an easy recipe that will be much enjoyed by my family.

Delicious!  I didn’t have yogurt, so used sweetened condensed milk.  Only had one banana so threw in a handful of craisins.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  It’s a little sweet because of my changes I think.  I will make it again, cut back on sugar, and add nuts.  But it’s so fast and easy which I like.  I just did it all in my stand mixer bowl, and it turned out fine.

I make this all the time, and it’s always a hit. I add vanilla, nutmeg, and cloves. Sour cream works as a good substitute for the yogurt.

made some changes including adding an extra half cup flour, not adding peanut butter, doubling the yogurt and adding chopped dates instead of chocolate chips. Turned out great!

Amazing.  I am making this recipe again today because my kids loved them so much.  I added a little extra peanut butter, vanilla and used vanilla yogurt instead of plain.  I also made them into muffins and put three chocolate chips on each one before baking, makes them pretty AND yummy!

Yup, mighty fine. I used some honey pear yogurt, since I didn't have plain, and peanut butter chips for half of the chocolate chips. Also used regular all purpose flour, since I didn't have whole wheat. Very moist and yummy. This will be my go-to banana bread recipe in the future.

I've made this many times.  So good as written.  I do add a teaspoon of vanilla, and a cup of either chopped pecans or walnuts.  

For variety, I also make with 1/2 dark chocolate and 1/2 peanut butter chips.  If you don't have yogurt, sour cream substitutes perfectly.

Did some things different... Coconut oil instead of canola, creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy, white flour instead of wheat, added a cup of crushed walnuts, used Greek vanilla/honey yogurt instead of plain. All measurements I kept the same though and I baked it as a loaf. My husband loves it!!! I did have to bake it for close to 60 mins for it to bake all the way through. Will make this again for any banana bread need!

I've replaced a peanut butter with cashew  - hazelnut butter.. 
I also added walnuts and it was amazing..

This is a great recipe! Whenever I make it I add half the amount of chocolate chips the recipe calls for and I add in some chopped up milk chocolate candy bar, the milk chocolate goes really nicely with the peanut butter flavor. I also use smooth peanut butter because I don't like anything crunchy in my bread.

Awesome recipe! I absolutely love the idea of yogurt (I used vanilla yogurt) in this, it made them perfect. I doubled the recipe, made one loaf and one pan of large muffins. I used 5 bananas instead of 4 and no oil, and also only used 1/2 cup of sugar in the whole batch and thought it was perfect because you could really taste the (creamy) peanut butter and chocolate!

Unbelievably good!!! I was worried that the chocolate flavor would be overpowering but there was a perfect balance to all the flavors. I am new to cooking and baking and found this very easy to make. You may want to let it cool a little longer than what was suggested. A small part of mine stuck in the pan. I don't think I would have had that problem if I had let it cool a little longer.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic. Doubled the recipe and made a pan of muffins and a loaf of bread. It was very moist, light and delicious. I didn't have any baking soda so the appearance of the bread is a little flat.  I added real vanilla extract to bring out some more flavor. 
Definitely a keeper.

Didn't have chocolate chips, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Muffins take 15 minutes, mini loaves 20 minutes. Hubby wanted to eat the whole batch! Yum. This is a keeper.

Great recipe! I love that it only uses a Tbsp. of oil. I was wanting to use up some PB2 I had on hand so I added a handful of that instead of peanut butter. I also added an extra banana. It came out very moist and yummy. The flavor was great. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I was a little disappointed because all I tasted was chocolate.  No peanut butter taste at all.  So chocolate lovers will love it!  I was looking more for the peanut butter taste.  If I try it again, I will probably use more peanut butter, and perhaps add some chopped peanuts, and less or no chocolate morsels.

Wow!  This is fantastic!  These days my 9-yr old hates anything with whole wheat, but I think the crunchiness of the peanut butter hides it!  So she has no idea she's eating something whole wheat!!!!  LOVE it, thank you so much for posting this recipe.  Our whole family loves it and it is great for the lunch boxes!

Tasty, moist and delicious! I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract - 3 bananas and used sour cream in place of the yogurt. I also made a glaze using water, power suger and cinnamon. My office LOVES when I bake them food and bring it in to sample! Such an easy, simple bread. I will be trying this as muffins next :)

Excellent!  I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet choc chips. Did not make any changes to this recipe.  My husband and I give it 5 stars.

Very, very good.  Made them into muffins, and added 1 t. almond flavoring - made them over the top.

Used this recipe to make muffins last night.  They are quite good!  My only complaint would be that the chocolate chips don't really seem to fit in with the banana and peanut butter flavours.  I love chocolate, just not in these muffins - the added flavour was a bit jarring.

Yum!  This bread was delicious, and will be my go-to recipe from now on.  I don't usually like chocolate chips in banana bread, so I skipped them, but I think I'll give them a shot next time.
