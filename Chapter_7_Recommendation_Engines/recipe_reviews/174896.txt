These are fabulous!!! My hubby's favorite brownie, and he's not usually a brownie fan! I've made them multiple times, and they never disappoint! I like to use my favorite Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips in place of the baking chocolate. Otherwise, I make these according to the recipe!

My husband LOVED these brownies.  I am not a big fan of cherries to begin with so I thought they were a bit too tangy for the brownies. They were still good though.  Will use this recipe again.
