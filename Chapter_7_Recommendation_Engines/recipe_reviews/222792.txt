I love the recipe, but it is time consuming.  To make things easier I used butter spray and put the Nutella in a bag and cut off the corner to pipe on the dough.

I made this with my 6 year old and she loved it.  Everyone did really.  We made it twice, the first time we had issues with the dough ripping when we put the butter on it.  The second time I used PAM olive oil spray (spray lightly) and they were perfect.

These are simple, delicious, and a fantastic way to use up leftover phyllo dough when making a savory entree for dinner. I always wind up with part of a package left over and am always looking for easy fillings, and this was one of our favorites. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Not only did I find these tasty, they are also pretty on the tray.  Will make again at Christmas time.  I am tempted to try this with peanut butter too.

This recipe was fantastic!  I did take someone's advice and put the Nutella in a Pastery bag .  It was so easy to spread the Nutella across the bottom and it gave a very even amount!  I also put a damp cloth over the Fillo while I was working on them to keep it moist. I can't wait to make it again

Oh wow, I have never used Phyllo before, this dessert is awesome!  It was really very easy, even with the delicate Phyllo pastry. I had one from the first tray and am going to have a hard time not eating more before my party tonight!  I sprinkled a little sugar on top of the second tray to give it a little sparkle too!

I made this 3 times -- just keeps getting better... 1) as written -- very good; 2) as written + some finely chopped walnuts mixed with the Nutella and sprayed the sheets lightly with butter-flavored Pam; dusted tops with powdered sugar after they cooled -- super yummy 3) changed filling to finely chopped walnuts with a sprinkle of cinnamon and drizzle of honey, folded in the ends to keep filling inside, dusted with cinnamon sugar before baking -- scrumptious!  Very adaptable recipe that is quick and easy.

They were really good! I used http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Substitute-Phyllo-Dough instead of buying some and it worked great. A pizza cutter is really nice when cutting it out! I served it with home made whipped cream and everyone loved it! It is basically a crispy crepe.

Yum the saltiness from the butter. The crispiness of the phyllo. The sweetness of the Nutella. WINNER. I didn't  have the full amount of Nutella so I made some with chocolate chips.

Great recipe!  I made these for a party, and tried 1/2 of them using melted butter and 1/2 using cooking spray.  The cooking spray was easier and I couldn't tell the difference. While they were still hot form the oven, I sprinkled with coarse sea salt. No leftovers!

I used Justin's brand Chocolate Hazelnut Spread and it was so delicious! It's a healthier alternative as it has 60% less sugar than Nutella and half the fat, plus it's non GMO and gluten free :)

These were better than I expected.  I had some phyllo dough and I was looking for something easy.  I used 2 sheets per roll, though, and sparingly spread room temperature butter over a smaller portion.  After they were done baking and had cooled, I sprinkled with a bit powdered sugar.  The kids really liekd them, and so did I.  5 stars for ease, simplicity, and being tasty.

WOW...these are awesome. I followed someone's suggestion to use Pam Spray instead of butter.  Worked great. I would suggest pouring the Nutella into a bowl and stir it quickly to loosen it up.  Then drop some onto the dough and use a butter knife to spread.  I tried doing it with a spoon and a brush and it was a disaster.  Butter knife is the way to go.  I also folded in both sides before rolling it up so the Nutella wouldn't leak out.  You really just need a think layer of Nutella.  I made 2 cigars out of each sheet. Next time I'll do the sea salt on top before I bake them so it sticks to the top.

Difficult to spread nutella without breaking dough. Used coconut oil instead of butter. Makes it more crisp, bake for a shorter time.

I made this per the recipe and it turned out good but could have been better. The proportion of phyllo to nutella was off. 1 tbsp of nutella is just too much, making it too sweet, for one sheet. I'll make this again but halve the nutella and add a second sheet of phyllo as well.

These are so good! Once I switched to a soft paintbrush for the butter I no longer had problems with the dough tearing, and the flavor was better than with cooking spray. I added a little sea salt to a few, which turned out to be a good idea. Used the piping bag idea for the Nutella - definitely easier. My final product turned out kind of flat - I'm not great at the rolling part - but I'm thinking if I need them to look awesome I could pipe the Nutella onto was paper and freeze it, then plop the frozen logs onto the phyllo. I'll let you know how it goes.

this was so easy...if you lay down a damp kitchen towel over the dough it comes up very easily.  i also used a baggie to place the nutella in.  I placed the baggie into a cup and poured it in.  wow my family loved these...Dont skip the sea salt flakes!  awsome recipe!

Awesome! So good! Once you get the hang of it they are really easy but a little time consuming to make. I ended up using about 3/4 the jar of Nutella. After they were baked they were a little more greasy than I would've liked but I think that's because I decided to brush the remaining butter on top of the rolled cigars before putting in the oven. Next time I won't do that but they are good either way!

Mehh.. It was way too much work for the reward. It was mildly decent tasting.  Way too sweet in my opinion. I think if you used something other than chocolate (peanut butter or honey) and put sea salt on the Philo, that would make it much better.
