I am the submitter of this recipe.  It is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  I created this the day after a fajita dinner with mango salsa.  So the salsa was pre made and the bell peppers were already chopped.  So it was only a matter of assembly.  It is a great way to use leftovers.  It tastes great with leftover rotisserie chicken, fajita chicken or blackened chicken.  In Texas there is a chain of grocery stores that makes a great mango salsa and also sells a package of pre-chopped three color peppers that can be used as a short-cut.  Either from scratch or using short-cuts the salad is delicious.

Pretty darn good recipe. Definitely worth making again. I recommend using Heirloom tomatoes instead of Roma. I also recommend getting the freshest juiciest mango you can and then lastly I recommend using red onion but I bet green onion works well too. By the way in an effort to save fat and calories I used chicken broth instead of olive oil for the dressing and skipped the sugar and I didn't miss a thing.

Wow this salad tastes great and is so tropical - but gets 4 stars for being time consuming and expensive to make! I changed a few things up but kept most ingredients the same. I made the mango salsa as the recipe stated and cooked the chicken breast with citrus pepper seasoning. Instead of the dressing recipe I substituted Newman's Own Light Lime vinaigrette. I still mixed up the chipotle spice mixture but sprinkled a little of it over the top of the salad before pouring on the dressing. Last I used a head of lettuce and mixed that with Salad Savoy for some crunch instead of the spinach & coleslaw mix. I only used red bell peppers instead of all 3 colors (because of the cost). It is a pretty impressive dish to serve!

I thought this was very good and healthy. I did chop all the veggies the day before to save time. Grilled the chicken and it was delish! Also it didn't specify the type of onion so I used red and it worked great.

I followed the recipe exactly - it has a wonderful medly of flavors. Next time I may chop up and add some iceberg lettuce just to give it a little crunch.

Delicious blend of flavors! It pleased a crowd of 7 and we were all full. I added more lime juice to the salsa and dressing to thin them out a bit. I had forgotten to thaw my chicken so I use canned and this was still a big satisfying salad. Vidalia onion in this made the salsa's only bite be from the jalapenos. Will definetly make over and over!

This recipe was a winner; tangy tasty and just involved a whole lot of chopping but super easy to make. We followed the recipe exactly.

I was a little nervous to try this salad and it was definitely time consuming....but WOW it was worth it! Loved it! I kept all the phases (dressing mango salsa) in separate bowls so the leftovers will stay fresh.

It was time consuming but it was delicious! If you prepare the mango salsa ahead of time it doesn't take long to put together. It makes 6 really generous servings. I love the mix of fresh veggies! The dressing and mango salsa flavors complement each other nicely. I sprinkled some Mrs. Dash chipotle flavor on two chicken breasts before cooking and dicing. Wonderful!

I only made the dressing to go on BBQ salmon with mango salsa. I made a salad and added black beans onion and avocado. It was a huge hit and went great with the mango salsa. I will definitely try it following this recipe with the chicken. Thanks!

Wow this salad was absolutely delicious! My whole family loved it and I have some picky eaters at my house. I made a few slight changes... I left off the blue cheese and used parsley instead of cilantro. The flavors were wonderful together. I will be making this again for sure!

This sounded so good but the broccoli slaw fruit salsa and blue cheese flavors just didn't taste good together. The dressing was so acidic my BF asked me to make something else just so he could finish the salad. Since this made two nights worth of food I created a creamy bbq honey mustard dressing for the second night and the difference was huge. The new dressing really made the flavors blend.

This is so delicious! The salsa and dressing go so well together and would be good on any combination of salad fixin's. I used queso fresco though for a more southwestern slant and because I don't like blue cheese. I will be making this salsa and maybe the whole salad minus meat with whatever Mexican food we have from now on.

This is delicious! A nice mix of sweet and heat. My only criticism is that this will not serve 6 as a main dish. I think you could stretch it to feed 4. My hubby and I had two generous servings and I have a large portion to take to work tomorrow. This is definitely a "keeper" and well worth all the chopping.

I made this with a few (minor) changes (feta instead of blue cheese toasted the pecans added romaine and left out the broccoli slaw and just used diced red pepper instead of the three-color dice). The flavors in this salad are fantastic. I grilled my chicken with a bit of chipotle seasoning (Mrs. Dash maybe or McCormick?). My mango wasn't really ripe enough so I added just a sprinkle of sugar - and when I had the mango salsa all prepped it just didn't seem "mango-ish" enough so I diced up some frozen mango and added that as well - maybe about 3/4 c. My husband and 13yo son really enjoyed this I'll be making it again. I served this in individual large pasta bowls - it made three large salads with enough left over for a small salad for my lunch the next day (I kept the components separate until ready to eat). Served with crusty bread/butter. Delish thanks for the recipe!

Amazing! Definitely one of my favorite salad recipes of all time. As other reviews mentioned this recipe is time consuming but worth the effort. I used red onion & halfed the amount called for and also added fresh avacado chunks. Love!

I took an easier route to prepare - bought Teriyaki Chicken breast strips at Trader Joe's bought Trader Joe Mango Pineapple Salsa and added avocado used regular cayenne pepper - just about an 1/8 of a teaspoon. Will definitely serve again.:)

Since there were just two of us I cut way back on the spinach and broccoli slaw and added the peppers into the mango mixture. The extra mango mix was delicious the next day over grilled fish. I also marinated my chicken breasts first in lime oil cumin & chipotle and added a couple of shots of tequila to the marinade.

I absolutely love the salad. I don't jalapeños because their little too hot for me so instead I dice up a few banana peppers also I added crumbled tomato basil feta cheese instead of blue cheese and I add diced cucumbers. So good its a little extra more work than a normal salad but the taste is well worth it

It was satisfying. However I added pineapple and would've probably been happier with the recipe if there was less or no raw onion/red pepper and possibly more mango.

Just made this salad. Absolutely delicious! And it took a lot less time than I thought it would. I bought a small can of Goya Chipotles and used some of the sauce from that for the lime dressing as the chipotle chili powder was a bit pricey and now I'll use the canned ones when I make chili. The lime dressing was great.
