Tasted just like my Nonnas. I added two tablespoons of Parmesan cheese to the batter and a sprinkle on top while they're warm.

I like pepper so next time I'll add some in the batter, I'm also dairy free but this was delicious with coconut milk!

Easy. Tasty not too heavy. I like mine almost well. Getting the batter browned adds depth from outside crisp to inside soft.

Thank you for the recipe! I had just 4 zucchini flowers on  my plant so halved the recipe and it was perfect! I just used a small cast iron pan so the oil was deeper and turned them so didn't use a ton of oil for the small amount I made. A fun way to use the flowers. 
I gave it a 4 only because after I made this recipe I made that Chef John's recipe for the ones that were stuffed with cheese, then dipped in batter and fried....they were superb.

I read a few reviews and added about 1/4 cup of  graded Parmesan cheese...so good! Even picky eaters ate it.

I added some gobs of garlic (awesome specialty foods) and I thickened up the  batter by one cup .
But came out delicious!
