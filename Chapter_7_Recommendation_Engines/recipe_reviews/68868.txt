This was good but I thought it could be much better (and faster) if you skipped the first step. Baking the chicken on a baking sheet makes it dry and bland. I made it again last night and it was so much better (5 star). I sautéed the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter and placed in bottom of dish then placed the uncooked chicken on top, added the sauce and topped it off with real crumbled bacon and baked for 25 minutes at 350.  Removed from oven and topped with 1 cup mozzarella and continued baking for 10 minutes at 350 (not 400). It was so moist and flavorful!

THIS IS DELICIOUS!!!  I did modify.  As others suggested I sauted (I used a bag and a half) of baby spinach leaves with (I used sliced portabella) mushrooms. I added a splash of white cooking wine and a teaspoon of garlic to the baby spinach/mushroom mix.  I sauted as long as I could without burning to get rid of as much moisture as possible then put mixture over bottom of baking dish. Meanwhile, I boiled my chicken then cut into cubes.  I then mixed and simmered my white sauce in the pan I sauted the spinach/mushroom ingredients, to take up the flavor. I stirred the cubed chicken in with the white sauce. I then poured the entire chicken/white sauce mixture over the layer of spinach and mushrooms.  I crushed up cooked real bacon I had on hand and sprinkled over top then finished with the mozza cheese. It baked beautifully! YUMMY!

This is a 5-star recipes using the techniques described by a previous reviewer. "Skip the first step. Then sauté the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter and place in bottom of dish. Then place the uncooked chicken on top, add the sauce and top it off with real crumbled bacon and bake for 25 minutes at 350. Remove from oven and top with 1 cup mozzarella and continue baking for 10 minutes at 350."

This is now one of my favorite dishes!  I do make quite a few changes based on reviews, but it comes out as an incomparably excellent dish that I would be proud to serve to company! My hubby stated it tastes like a meal at one of those "fancy restaurants". :)  My changes were as follows: 1. I fried 4 pieces of bacon on the stove. 2. In the bacon grease, I sauteed the chicken which I had cut into bite-sized pieces and the garlic. I added half of the chicken chunks in with the sauce and the other half I laid on top of the spinach and mushrooms and poured the sauce over. 3. In the bacon/chicken juice, I sauteed fresh spinach leaves (1 bag of prewashed) and the mushrooms. 4.  I used 1% milk instead of half and half.  5. I put 1 cup of Mozz. in the sauce and 1 cup on top of the casserole.  6. I baked at 350 for about 30 mins and put the last cup of cheese on the last 10 mins.  I baked in a covered casserole dish until about 10 mins were left.  When I added the cheese, I left the casserole uncovered.  Lastly, I served over angel hair pasta with "Summerly Squash" w/ veggies from my veggie garden, and it was a nice compliment to the entree. This was a PERFECTLY delicious meal, and I'm so excited about the leftovers! ;) Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my goodness this recipe is GREAT! The different flavors meshed wonderfully together. I saved myself a lot of time and stress changing just a few things. Those changes were: 1.) cut up chicken into chunks 2.) cooked chicken and minced garlic together in a pan with a few tablespoons of olive oil 3.) After chicken was cooked, I added the soup, milk instead half-and-half, 6 oz. shredded mozzarella, and lemon juice. 4.) Stired it all up on medium heat til creamy and then poured the entire mix on top of the spinach (I used frozen; turned out just fine) and mushroom layer as stated in the recipe. I then crumbled real bacon on the top and baked for 25 minutes. We ate it on top of bowtie pasta. This is DEFINITELY a keeper!!! So easy to make and so delicious! Thanks =)

Made a few changes with what I had on hand...I used milk instead of the half and half.  I made my own bacon bits and sauteed the chicken in the bacon grease, just a few minutes on each side.  Then, put that off to the side and added the mushrooms and the garlic to the pan with just a little butter and olive oil.  I deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine and added the soup milk mixture.  I forgot all about the lemon juice and reduced the seasonings to 1/2 because of the comments from other reviewers.  Baked this for 20 minutes and then added the cheese for another 10 minutes at 350.  Served it with Roasted Garlic Wild Rice and it was delicious.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I loved it.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and sauteed them in a little olive oil and minced garlic until cooked thru.  Removed the chicken and wilted some fresh spinach in the chicken juice that was left in the pan.  Removed and squeezed dry.  I did not use butter or lemon juice.  Just mixed together mushroom soup, fat free half and half, parmesan and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  Stirred chicken and spinach into the soup mixture, poured into a pie plate and just sprinkled a little additional parmesan cheese on top.  Served over angel hair spaghetti.  The sauce is wonderful!  To cut way down on the fat in this recipe, I omitted the butter, bacon bits and mozzarella cheese and used fat free half and half and it still tasted delicious.

I doubled this recipe for a casual dinner party with my college friends and they loved it. Of course, anything home-cooked is better than the food they serve at the campus cafeteria, but this recipe was easy and delicious.

I took some advice from fellow reviewers and cut up the chicken into bite-size pieces and cooked it on the stove top with some onion and a pinch of salt.

For the sauce, I put all of the cheese in the pot (instead of sprinkling on top) and I used 3/4 cup 2% milk instead of a whole cup so it wouldn't be too runny. I also only added one tablespoon each of the garlic and Italian seasoning (again, I doubled the recipe). Either way though, I think that if I made 4 servings, I'd still use a little less Italian seasoning, because 1 tbsp was plenty.

In the end, I sprayed the pan and put cooked penne on the bottom, topped that with chopped up broccoli, then the chicken. Since it was already done, I put it, uncovered, in a 350 degree oven for 15 min. just to heat it through.

Served with the Cheddar Bay Biscuits from this site...awesome!

Great recipe; thanks!

Pretty good overall.  I saute the chicken rather than bake, as baking can tend to dry out the chicken.  Also, I use about 1/2 a bag of fresh (washed and dried) spinach spread out evenly on the bottom of the pan.  I also add a splash of white wine. This has a "sophisticated" taste that is good enough for company.

Excellent! My chicken-loathing boyfried even after the leftovers the next night! Taking some of the other reviews into account, I browned the chicken on top the stove and used two bags of pre-washed fresh spinach.  I also opted for milk rather than cream.  The resulting casserole was a bit 'saucier' than I expected but I cooked it in the oven for about an hour because the pieces of chicken were so huge!  However, the chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  

I never know whether or not to cover a casserole unless the directions specify that, so I put a cover on this one.  Maybe that was why it had more liquid.  But don't let my results sway you!  This is an excellent dish!!!

The only thing I 'might' add would be a small amount (1/4 cup) of chopped onion to give more flavor to the spinach.

I love rich, creamy dishes, and expected to love this one. Oddly enough, it was too rich for me. (I didn't know this was possible.)   I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I used frozen spinach instead of canned (thawed, with excess moisture squeezed out), I did not pre-bake the chicken, and I used whole milk instead of half-and-half. I may make this again with half the cheese or with some chicken broth added to dilute the sauce a little. I loved the flavor, it was just too heavy for me somehow.

I have made this recipe many times and my family loves it!  The bacon, spinach and mushroom flavors are so yummy together.  I have modified it to be more kid friendly because I have some picky eaters.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and sautee them in a little bit of oil in a skillet.  In the sauce I use 2 cans of soup and 1 cup of milk (instead 1/2 cup of half and half).  This makes it more saucy which works better for serving over noodles.  For the spinach I use fresh and I sautee it in a little butter and garlic salt and then I blend it up to make a smooth green base for the casserole.  (My kids love the green part the best and they don't even know it is spinach!).  I also omit the mushroom layer.  We serve it over pasta for a complete meal.

MY HUSBAND LICKED THE BOWL!  This will be one he asks for again and again! I incorporated many of the recommended changes per previous reviews. I fried 4 pieces of bacon until crisp (set aside and crumbled), then browned 1 pound chicken tenders in the bacon fat, then I removed the chicken and wilted fresh baby spinach with the mushrooms in the same pan.  I used skim milk and the regular cream of mushroom soup (though I did notice that campbell's now has a cream of mushroom with roasted garlic option).  I only used 2 teaspoons italian seasoning and added fresh ground black pepper.  Finally, I only used 1 cup of shredded mozzarella.  This recipe was also good with vegetarian bacon (Morning Star Farms) and next time I will try the Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom because it has less Sodium and I find the recipe a bit salty.  Bon appetite!

Great new dish for the rotation of meals!  We had Italian the night before we ate this so I put in basil instead of Italian seasoning.  Bacon and cheese are delicious and add a nice richness to the dish.  Thanks for sharing it!  (I made a double batch and there is only a tiny bit left)

Wonderful presentation and tasty dish! Per reviews, I also did the following: sautéed the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter and placed in bottom of dish then placed the uncooked chicken on top, added the sauce and topped it off with real crumbled bacon and baked for 25 minutes at 350. Removed from oven and topped with 1 cup mozzarella and continued baking for 10 minutes at 350 (not 400)

Made this with the slight changes noted by other reviewers and it was delicious.  Used cooked bacon, milk instead of half and half, and fresh spinach instead of canned. Sauteed fresh spinach and mushrooms in the bacon grease, placed on the bottom of the casserole dish, covered with raw chicken breast halves, the sauce, and crumbled bacon.  Cooked 20 minutes at 350, topped with mozzarella and cooked 10 more minutes.  Turned out perfect!

I am not sure how to rate this since the original recipe needs some serious cutbacks on fat (38.7 g/serving) and salt (1844 mg/serving), but has great flavor. The ingredient combination is very appealing.   I adjusted the salt level by using fresh spinach and using my own mushroom soup-sauce instead of canned. I only used 2 T butter to saute the garlic and also sauteed about 3/4 c. of onion and 2 minced mushrooms before proceeding to make the soup/sauce with 2 T. flour, 1 T. lemon juice, 1 3/4 c. skim milk, 1/3 c. white wine, and  1/2 c. reduced fat sour cream.  I omitted the bacon and used grilled chicken breasts which provided smokey flavor.  I used a 13x9 inch glass baking dish, sprayed with Canola oil, and layered: cooked rigatoni pasta--just enough to cover the bottom, fresh spinach leaves, fresh mushrooms, half of the sauce, 1/2 c. mozzarella, grilled chicken breast sliced thin, the other half of the sauce, 1 c. mozzarella, and a sprinkling of parsley. As I was adding the mozzarella to the top, I stopped when the surface was covered using 1/2 c. less than the recipe called for.  I thought this was full of flavor with the adjustments and see no need to ruin it with excess fat and salt. I'll make this again with the changes as it becomes a 5 star recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe idea.

Loved recipe! Seared Chicken in large skillet in about 2 TBLS Olive oil, cooked breasts almost all the way thru, let cool then cubed . Then put the butter & lemon juice in the pan to scrape up browned pieces, this made for a much richer sauce and made the process faster.  Added garlic and let it brown then added soup, and 1/2 & 1/2 then followed recipe the rest of the way except I used frozen/thawed spinach, much better flavor and texture than canned not to mention it's better for you! Big Hit!

This is a keeper.  Served it over wild rice.  My changes: Cooked cubed chicken in skillet and set aside.  Sauteed portabello mushrooms and a bag of fresh spinach in skillet, drained liquid and put in bottom of dish.  Put sauce ingredients in skillet until combined and then added chicken.  Poured sauce and chicken mixture over spinach.  Topped with a sprinkle of mozzarella.  (I used low fat sour cream instead of half and half.)

This is excellent!  I used fresh baby spinich leaves, instead of canned.  I doubled the amount of mushrooms and sauted them in butter.  When they were nearly done, I added the spinich to wilt the leaves.  I also cut the chicken in bite sized pieces and sauted in butter in a skillet instead of baking.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it was absolutely delicious.  My three year old even liked it.  I served it over a bed of pasta.  This is definitely a keeper!

This is a great make ahead casserole. I assembled it the night before I baked it & it was perfect. I sauteed my chicken breasts with olive oil, season salt, pepper and garlic. Also I used fresh spinach which I lightly sauteed with the mushrooms and laid in the bottom of my casserole dish. I also tried to make a it a little healthier and used fat free half and half and crumbled a couple of pieces of turkey bacon on top. I topped it w/ mozzarella slices (they melt more even than shredded) and it was great.

Like Previous reviewers, I made a few changes to make this my own 5 star recipe.  It truly is guest worthy.  I sauteed a bag of fresh spinach, pack of fresh sliced mushrooms, 2 cloves of garlic and pat of butter until wilted.  I then poured this mixture on the bottom of a 9x 13 pan.  I pounded out 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, seasoned them with salt and pepper and layed them on top of the spinach mixture.  I poured a jar of Classico alfredo sauce on top of the breasts and sprinkled a light dusting of Italian seasoning - maybe half a teaspoon.  I squeezed about 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice all over and baked uncovered for 35 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then I opened oven and added a generous sprinkling of mozzarella cheese and fresh flat leaf parsley and baked for an additional 10 minutes.  I removed from oven and let stand for 10 minutes.  Pure heaven...tender, juicy and so tasty.  A great marriage of flavors for this chicken dish.

This was excellent. I sauteed fresh spinach in mushrooms in the butter and placed on the bottom of the baking dish. I then sliced the chicken breast in two (for faster cooking) and placed on top. I put some salt on top. In the saute pan, i added the garlic, italian seasoning, parmesan c of mushrom and half and half stirring constantly. I poured the mixture over the chicken and topped with mozzarella. and some freshly group pepper. I turned out so good and was really filling. Nex time, I will use two t minced garlic instead of 3.

I've made this dish twice now, once for my husband and once for my mother, and it's an absolutely lovely dish. It goes very nicely with red wine and some asparagus or green beans on the side. I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't bake the chicken but put everything together in a casserole and baked it all together. I highly recommend doing it this way. With this change, this is definitely a keeper and most certainly company-worthy.

I give my own version 5 stars, but my changes were enough for me to have to give it 4 stars as is.  Here's what I did... Chopped then fried 5-6 pieces of bacon, set aside  Sautéed the spinach and mushrooms with garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and a little white wine (from my glass) in the bacon grease   Removed the spinach and mushrooms, placed in the bottom of the baking dish and sprinkled half of the bacon on top, then sautéed 3 chicken breasts (cut in chunks) with more garlic, some more white wine, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper  While the chicken was sautéing, I melted ½ a stick of butter in a sauce pan, then added ½ and ½ (probably about a cup), squeezed in the juice of half a lemon, some Italian seasoning (about a tablespoon), more red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, garlic and whisked until it boiled.  Once the chicken was just done, I added it to the top of the spinach/mushroom mix, topped it with the rest of the bacon and deglazed the pan with more white wine before adding my butter/cream mixture. Then about ¾ cup of parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce… Once the parmesan had melted enough and the sauce was thick enough I poured it over the top of the chicken.  Baked for 20 minutes at 400, then added 1 cup or more of mozzarella cheese to the top and baked for about 10 minutes longer. Served over farfalle.   RAVE reviews from my date – we both felt like we were in heaven eating this.  So, so good.

WOW!! This dish rivals ones found in your favorite Italian chains.  I used a bag of fresh baby spinach instead of canned and doubled the recipe.  Even my teenagers ate the spinach.  Definitely serve with paste.  I did not bake the chicken first, but instead browned the breasts off in an elelectric skillet and set aside while preparing the sauce.  I have also made the sauce and added a can of chicken (or two) and served over pasta for a quick and easy meal.  The fat can be reduced with using 1% fat milk and fat free soup with no change to the taste.  This dish has already become a family favorite.

This was so good!  I used cooked cubed chicken that I already had cooked.  I also used fresh spinach.  I also served it with pasta to make it more like a casserole.  Next time I will add the pasta to the dish before baking it.

This is sooo good! This is what I did when I doubled the recipe and did not add the mushrooms. I cut chicken into strips, season it, and saute them with 3 cloves of garlic (I used a lid to soften the chicken) . For the white sauce mixture, I added about a cup of white wine,, fresh spinach, and 4 cloves of crushed garlic, and added a pinch of salt to taste, then followed the recipe as is. I then poured it over  al dente spiral noodles in a deep dish casserole, mixed in 2 cups of mozarella covered with foil, and baked for about 30 to 40 mins.  Awesome!

YUMMY! My husband looooooved it too because it's low carb and still so, so tasty. I followed the tips by VICSGARDEN to saute the spinach and mushrooms and then put the uncooked chicken on top followed by the sauce then real bacon bits (then cook at 350 for 25 mins then top with mozarella and cook for another 10 minutes). I also cut the chicken up in chunks just because we prefer chicken that way. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer to really get the moisture out of the spinach/mushrooms. It already ends up with a lot of moisture so it was a good tip (I used the canned spinach). I substituted whole milk for the half and half because that is what I had. Seriously yummy for a not too difficult meal. Don't skip the bacon - it really adds to it.

The overall taste is good...I think the next time I will saute the mushrooms, cube the chicken, mix everything together and then top it with the cheese and bacon. The sauce is so yummy but the spinach tastes flat if you get a bite without the sauce. Mixing it all together and making a florentine casserole will suit our tastes I believe.

This recipe revolves around the extremely luscious sauce.  It is very rich - not for those who don't like a heavy sauce.  I loved it, but will try it with milk in place of the half-n-half next time.  I did use canned spinach, drained and pressed between paper towels to get ALL of the water out, and it was fine.  It would save time to use frozen.  I also used fish, (orange roughy) as the recipe says it can be used in place of the chicken.  The fish was a bit too delicate to stand up to the heavy sauce, so next time I will use either chicken or salmon, a less "fluffy" fish.  Definately use real bacon, or the real bacon bits.  Fake ones won't cut it.  All in all, this is an awesome dish, and as my husband said, "this tastes like something you would pay $20 for in a restaurant."  If you like gourmet cuisine - try it.  It's really that good!

All the kids and husband loved this version of cream sauce. I prepared a little different than directed though. I layered the bottom of 9x13 pan with thin sliced potatoes, covered with bag of baby spinach. Pan fried cut up chicken in olive oil, garlic and Italian seasoning. Prepared sauce as directed with a splash of white wine, milk instead of cream. Seemed soupy when it first came out but the potatoes soaked it up as it cooled.

Great recipe.  I made a few changes to make it alot easier.  I doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13 pan.  I cut the chicken breast into bite size pieces and cooked with 3 tsp minced garlic.  While chicken was cooking I sauteed the mushrooms. After chicken was done I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup half-and-half, 2 tbs lemon juice,1 tbs  italian seasoning, 3/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese, 3oz bag of bacon bits, frozen spinach add as much or as little as you like, 4 oz of sauteed mushrooms, 1/2 bag of cooked egg noodles.   Place in pan, bake at 350 for 20 mins. Top with Mozzarella cheese and cheese fried onions which adds texture and taste.  Bake additional 20 mins or until hot and enjoy.

Im not sure what Im missing? I thought this dish was barely edible.  Maybe I just dont like the canned soup casseroles?  I followed the recipe except for the lemon juice and I used milk instead of 1/2&1/2 bc its what I had. I thought this dish was bland and had an odd flavor.  I think Id try this dish again but with jarred alfredo and maybe fresh spinach instead...

My 6 year old rated it "delicious". 

I made two changes. I was running short of time and used Bertolli's Portebello wine and  cream sauce from a jar instead of making the sauce as listed. I also used fresh baby spinach instead of canned spinach. Both of these changes really cut down on the ammount of salt (which as listed is astronomical) and made a really really good dinner. 

Served with noodles and corn.

Yum.  I mixed everything together in a bowl, stuck it in a casserole dish, and baked it up.  It was delicious.  I admit I fried up some turkey bacon, and cooked fresh mushrooms, fresh spinach, and 13 cloves of garlic in the drippings, so I had some serious/layered flavor going on.  And, I used leftover cooked chicken from my freezer (which was what lead me to this cooking method modification in the first place).  All the ingredients listed in the recipe were present, and it was a very delicious dish indeed.  Ah, leftover cooked chicken from the freezer - a girl's best friend.

I took the advice of the top reviews and this was spectacular!  I sauteed a bag of fresh spinach and sliced mushrooms with butter and garlic.  Placed them in a dish, topped with raw cubed chicken and then the sauce.  I used whole milk instead of cream and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  I cooked up bacon, chopped it and placed it on top.  Baked for 25 mins at 350, put the cheese on top and baked for 10 mins.  It was so delicious!  It tasted like something I could get at a restaurant.  Next time after I sautee the spinach mixture and remove it from the pan, I will add the cubed chicken and brown it slightly before putting it in the dish.  My cubed chicken stuck together while baking when I added it completely raw.  I will also use more than 4oz mushrooms and more bacon as I only cut up 7 pieces this time.

I skipped the first step of precooking the chicken and sauteed fresh spinach and mushrooms with 1 tsp of the minced garlic.  Used 3 large chicken breast and there was just the right amount of sauce.  Use the parmesan cheese sparingly as that combined with the bacon can make the dish overly salty.

Very good. It was rich and creamy. I followed others reviews and sauteed mushrooms and spinach and put it on the bottom of the casserole dish, and then put the uncooked chicken on top and poured the cream sauce over it.

Excellent flavor! I did change a few things per other reviews. 1. Sautéed mushrooms, onion (1/4 chopped), garlic and spinach then placed this mixture on the bottom of baking dish 2. Used real bacon 3. Pan seared the chicken breast first to seal in the juices...used the same pan I fried the bacon in.  Thanks for sharing.  This was one of my favorites from this site and my 2 year old even ate it :)

I made this recipe again not using my own advice to use broccoli. I really enjoyed this recipe this time. I liked the flavors in the sauce. Did use canned spinach and didn't layer but blended the spinach and mushrooms into the sauce. Didn't really care much for the mozz cheese on top, next time I will add that to the sauce too and just let the chicken brown nicely on top. I used tenders and that worked out good. Served it over penne pasta. My teenage boy actually ate leftovers of this...unheard of.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes! You can divide this recipe in half by two baking pie pans and freeze the other for a rainy day. This is also a good one to cook for yourself and give the other half for a friend (i.e. funeral). I did do some changes as recommend by others: didn't do step 1, I sautéed the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter and placed in bottom of dish then placed the uncooked chicken on top, added the sauce and topped it off with real crumbled bacon and baked for 25 minutes at 350. Removed from oven and topped with 1 cup mozzarella and continued baking for 10 minutes at 350 (not 400). Thanks VICSGARDEN for the tips! Came out amazing!

The sauce in this casserole is fantastic.  I replaced the half-an-half with heavy cream because it comes in a smaller carton (less leftover)!  I tried the canned spinach and it was kind of nasty - use 10 oz thawed frozen instead (or fresh).  I doubled the mushrooms and used Morning Star bacon strips (soy) which are better than bacon bits.  Like other reviewers, I simplified by cubing the raw chicken (I used 1 lb) and sauteing it with the mushrooms.  Then I added the sauce ingredients and 1 cup of the mozzarella.  I baked for 20 minutes at 350, topped with the other cup of mozzarella and baked for 10 more minutes.  I'm not a huge fan of spinach, so I tried it with broccoli once, but it just didn't work.  Tried it with pasta as well, but I thought it detracted from the sauce.

Great recipe. I spiced it up on each level with some Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning and also in the sauce. I used more Italian seasoning and I also seasoned the chicken breasts before cooking them with garlic powder and Slap Ya Mama.  I also used more mushrooms and 2 cans of the soup instead of one...had 5 chicken breasts...def making this again!

Made this last night for the hubby and served with potatoes and toasted garlic bread topped with mozzerella cheese :) The only change I made on the recipe was that I used 1 can of spinach instead of 2. Im not a huge spinach eater anyway, but had I used 2, I feel it would have been way too much.  The hubby devoured this and I caught him eating out of the baking dish! ;) He said it was one of his favorite meals Ive made. Definately recommend this recipe! :) Happy Eating!

This is a quick, easy and excellent tasting recipe! I did what others suggested and DID NOT cook the chicken before hand. Instead I put the chicken in raw and cooked on 350 for about 45 mins and the chicken was tender and juicy. I did not put bacon bits on it, not because I don't like bacon, I just wasn't feeling it that particular night but I didn't miss it at all! I will definitely be making this again, the husband isn't a huge chicken fan but he made sure I saved this recipe!

Very good!  Based upon other reviews, made a few adjustments that worked well.  I cooked 5 strips of bacon first, drained grease and then cut up chicken into bite sized pieces and then cooked chicken in bacon grease in large skillet.  Used one 9 ounce bag of FRESH spinach & sauteed with the mushrooms in EVOO and a clove of garlic.  One bag of spinach was fine for us but more would have been okay too. As for the sauce, used 2% milk instead of half & half and also cut back Italian seasoning to 1 teaspoon and that was plenty!  Took the advise of adding the chicken into the sauce before pouring over the spinach/mushrooms.  Everything else done as written.  Served with bow tie pasta.  Definitely a keeper and would highly recommend it!

Good the second time around.  First time I followed the recipe, and both my husband and I thought it was okay.  Second time around, I used fresh spinach and mushrooms, sauteed those in a pan with a little bit of olive oil.  I skipped the prebaking chicken step.  In the baking pan, I put the spinach down first, then the chicken, topped with the sauce, real bacon bits, and mozzi cheese.  Much better with fresh spinach.

My husband has a new favorite! This was delicious and easy to make. I did what other reviewers suggested skipped baking the chicken first. I first sauteed the spinach and mushrooms together. Then spread it on the bottom of the baking dish and placed cubed uncooked chicken pieces on top, covered with the sauce mixture and then the bacon bits. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes and then topped it with the mozzarella and bakes it for another 10 mins at 350. Great dish!

This didn't taste like much.  It wasn't bad.  It just didn't taste like "Mmmm" either.  Kinda flat-tasting.  Almost reminded me of a quiche without the eggs, salt & pepper.  :/  :)  I'll still keep looking for good spinach dishes.

Easy to follow, but I made some changes as I didn't have all the ingredients listed... I used a small carton of table cream, and 3/4 brick of cream cheese instead of the milk and cream of mushroom soup and it turned out wonderfully!!

After seeing all the reviews i had to try this. I was actually shocked. Allrecipes has never let me down based on positive reviews. This one certainly did. I think that it has too much canned spinach. The overall taste was good but taste too much like a can of spinach. I will tweak this next time and see where it comes out.

This was SO TASTEY!  So many flavors that went extremely well together! My husband and kids loved it to pieces and my oldest son, who's the pickiest eater, even asked for seconds! I did make some changes though. I used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom soup, 1/2 cup of 2% milk instead of half and half, 2 cans of french style green beans instead of spinach, and no mushrooms because my husband is allergic. Then I skipped the first step and just baked it all together at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, took it out and sprinkled the cheese on top, then continued cooking at 400 degrees for about 10 more minutes. It tasted AMAZING!

Very good recipe. I took advice from others and sauteed the mushrooms and spinach with garlic and placed them on the bottom of the baking dish, then layered the chicken, and lastly the sauce. My husband and I loved it! Will make again...

If I made this recipe as written, I probably would have only given it 4 stars but since I made a few changes based on the other reviews, it is absolutely 5 stars!  I'm not a big spinach or mushroom fan but I LOVED this!  I pretty much copied what another reviewer did word for word.  I first fried 5 pieces of bacon in a frying pan and then sauteed the chicken (cut into bite sized pieces) in the bacon grease.  I then sauteed the spinach (used 1 bag of fresh prewashed instead of canned) and mushrooms in the bacon grease/chicken juice.  I added 1/2 c. mozzerella to the sauce and sprinkled another cup on top for the last 10 minutes of baking -- the mozz browned beautifully only being in uncovered for 10 mins -- I also covered with foil for the first 1/2 of baking before I put the cheese on.  I know cooking in the bacon grease isn't the healthiest way to go but it sure did add tons of flavor!  I served over angel hair seasoned with a little basil and butter (to keep the pasta from sticking).  SOOOOO good!

Oh my - this definitely goes in my favorites! I wasn't sure at first with all the different flavors but they worked so well. I think the bacon was the perfect touch. The only substitution I made was I used Provolone cheese instead of mozzarella. Tasted like something from a restaurant and I normally don't say that when there's cream of mushroom soup involved! We put it over rice - delish!

YUM!  I have made this recipe several times now, and I have started substituting milk for the half and half.  I personally don't miss it - I think that lots of cheese makes up for it!  A good dish for company.  Thanks!

I cooked thin spaghetti and layered it into the bottom of a glass dish.  I then followed the recipe and added it to the top of the pasta.  I baked until bubbly and it was wonderful!

Amazing!  I made some changes based on other reviews.  I cubed the chicken, seasoned it with Montreal Steak seasoning and sauteed it.  I then sauteed 10 oz of sliced mushrooms and wilted a bag of baby spinach.  I also used less butter in the sauce.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to reduce or even omit the shredded cheese on top.  It is already quite a heavy dish and I didn't think the cheese really added to it.  I served this over rice and my whole family was licking their plates!  I would definitely serve this to company.  We will make this again!

This is my absolute favorite chicken.  I am not a cook, and this is so easy and so consistantly good - I feel like I could serve this to other people.  I make it at least once a week.  I do use about half of the Italian seasoning, and I use milk instead of half and half and it rocks!

I loved it.  Followed Vicsgarden's review and skipped the first step of baking the chicken.  Sauteed the mushrooms and chopped fresh baby spinach with some garlic.  Poured into the bottom of the baking dish then topped with chicken breasts, poured sauce over then topped with parm cheeese.  I didn't have mozzarella on hand.  I really enjoyed it.  Served with angel hair pasta with peeled and chopped tomatoes plus some finely chopped garlic.  Rave reviews!  In my regular rotation, thank you Bryan0320!

Full of flavor. I too skipped the step of baking the chicken prior. I cooked the bacon then sauted the spiniach (one large bag) and mushrooms in the bacon fat. Layered the dish with the spinach, mushrooms then the chopped raw chicken (3 breasts) on top, sprinkled with the bacon (really added to the flavor and texture of this dish) cooked at 350 for 25 min then sprinkled the cheese and cooked an additional 10 min. I forgot to purchase the half and half. As a result my sauce came out way to thin but still full of flavor. Served with Angel Hair pasta. My husband and friend raved about it. Thank You!

This turned out great - I followed the recommendation to skip pre-cooking the chicken and just baked it a little longer. Wonderfully easy dish.

Easy and excellent!  I made similar changes as other users did - I cooked the chicken in the crock pot 4 hours on low (started frozen) with 1/2 stick butter and dry italian seasoning.  I put fresh spinach (10 oz container) on the bottom of 9x13, layered fresh mushrooms, chopped chicken, sauce, and bacon pieces.  Everyone loves it!

I would never dream of using "canned" spinach...bleh.  Used frozen chopped spinach instead and thawed and squeezed it dry.  Fresh would be best too. Good recipe otherwise.

I made the same modifications as Vicsgarden and served over garlic rice pilaf.  Wow, this was an intense meal.  By far the richest, most decadent chicken recipe I've ever eaten or prepared.  I think next time I will make it a little lighter so I don't go into an automatic food coma after my second bite.  Maybe lighter on the mozzarella?  Tomatoes instead of bacon?  Well anyway, this was awesome and I'll be making it again either way!

The recipe was great! My guests loved it! I used fresh spinach instead of canned, layered evenly in the pan as to cover the whole bottom of the pan. I also added about 3 oz of White wine.

I made this into a true casserole instead-boiled and shredded the chicken, cooking and crumbled bacon slices, and layered both with fresh mushrooms i the bottom of the baking dish.  I then made sauce with 1 minced garlic clove and poured over the top.  I finished it off with the mozzaerlla (just 1 cup) and Panko bread crumbs.  And baked for 25 minutes at 350.  This was EXCELLENT!!!!  My husband and I both went crazy over it.  Easy and delicious without the processed soup casserole taste.

Thanks for a great recipe.  I have a large family and not 1 person had a complaint.  Next time I would like to try fresh spinach and leave out the bacon bits but other then that its perfect.

The Italian seasoning was too much. It was good I would have to tweak it if I make again. Maybe some sour cream or something. It was very heavy.
My husband enjoyed very much and he never says anything :)
Thanks so much!

Delicious!!!  The ONLY change I will make next time is to cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  I didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 so I just used milk and it was fine (and saved a few calories)  Thanks for sharing!  Loved it!

Great easy dinner. I grilled my chicken before putting in the oven and the chicken had a great taste. Served over fettucine pasta. Next time I won't add so much cheese but the sause was delicious!!

More! More! More! This recipe was not enought to feed 4 people. I recommend doubling the recipe because people will want seconds, and left overs. Great tasting and easy. Cook the chicken ahead of time and dice it up with everything else to make it more of a casserole.

Super delicious!  I modified the recipe to make it a little healthier and to suit our tastes by using Healthy Choice cream of chicken, fat free half and half, frozen spinach (thawed and drained), broccoli rather than mushrooms, about 1/3 c. bacon bits and 1 c. part-skim mozzarella.   I also cut up the chicken and sauteed it in 1 tbsp olive oil rather than baking it off.  Will definitely make again!

My house mates and I loved this dish! I too covered mine and it produced more liquid than I wanted, but still very good. I used low-sodium bacon and reduced sodium mushroom soup and it was plenty salty...do not add salt to this dish. Also, I served crusty, warm homemade bread instead of rice or pasta and it was great. We also cut up some Kalamata olives for the top...WOW!

I read most of the reviews before I prepared this recipe.  I agree, the chicken would be dry if baked. I pan seared thin chicken fillets in a small amount of butter in a pan. Romoved the chicken from the pan and sauted sliced portabello mushrooms and one pound of fresh baby spinach in the same pan. I followed the recipe directions for the white sauce exactly.  I thought one tablespoon of Italian seasoning was overpowering.  I will use about a tsp. next time.  It also needed salt.  This was a wonderful dish served over angel hair pasta.

This is a tasty dish that was easy to prepare.  As someone who has to watch my carbs, this is great dish that the whole family liked.  Will make it again for sure.  My only change would be cook the chicken no more than 20 minutes so it does not overcook.

Oh my, this was very good!  Five stars for taste, 4 stars for not being the most healthy choice, smiles.  Lots of salt and fat in this but hard not to want more once you start eating it.  I reduced canned mushrooms, reduced the bacon bits to 1/3 cup, and the mozzarella to 1 cup, and it was still plenty flavorful and cheesy.  Big YUMS.  Thank you for sharing this one.

This is outstanding.  I used the suggestions of others and baked the chicken on top of the mushrooms & spinach in the sauce for 25 minutes, then put the mozzarella on & baked for ten more minutes. I think this would be great baked on a wheat pizza crust.   :-)

after reading all reviews, I decided to try this recipe. OMW, I don't even know what to say. It was nothing short of spectacular!! It is far superior to anything I have ever eaten in any Italian restaurant anywhere. I did make a few changes.  fried my own bacon and used the pan drippings instead of butter, used fresh spinach, added a sliced sweet onion to bacon and cooked together, used skim milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and 5 cheese Italian blend instead of Mozz. cheese. Did not cook chicken first at all. I could not beleive how easy and yummy this was! Amazing!!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I, like many others, changed a few things: I first cooked some bacon in a large skillet, and set the bacon aside to crumble later. I then seared the chicken in the bacon grease & set aside.  I then sauteed the onion & mushroom for a couple of minutes, then added 1 bag fresh spinach and couple cloves of fresh garlic. Place mixture in the bottom of the dish, then place the chicken on top.  I did the sauce just the same, but I might use a little less Italian seasoning next time! (Maybe 1/2 - 3/4 Tbsp. Italian season.) Add the sauce and top it off with the reserved crumbled bacon and bake for 25 minutes at 350. Remove from oven and top with 1 cup mozzarella and continue baking for 10 minutes at 350. I also served it all on a bed of buttered angel hair pasta. Serve w/ side salad & crusty garlic bread! YUM!!

This dish was so GOOOD!!! I made a few changes, since I didn't have Italian seasoning I used Basil, Oregeno, And Thyme.  I also didn't have half and half so I used Heavy Whipping Cream that I had on hand. We then poured the Sauce and Chicken over Bowtite Noodles.  It was so GOOD!! If I could give it more stars I would.  My husband rated this dish at an 11 1/2 Stars. We will definately be using this recipe often. Thanks for sharing!

What a great recipe!  I used all the same ingredients... but prepared it slightly differently.  First I sauted 1 large bag of fresh spinach with mushrooms in a little butter until all the moisture was out.  Placed those in bottom of pan.  Then, I browned the chicken in the same skillet for about 3 minutes on each side.  I added ALL sauce ingredients to the pan and gently stirred until mixed well around chicken, brought to light bubble, and poured over spinach/mushroom mix.  Topped with bacon and baked @ 350 for 25 minutes, topped with mozz cheese and baked at 350 for 10 more minutes.  AMAZING!!! Great flavor and the chicken was SO moist!

Excellent.
Changes I made since I doubled the recipe:
Sautéed garlic and 8 oz fresh mushrooms in olive oil versus butter.
Seasoned chicken and cooked on top of stove versus oven.
In addition to 1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup (used 98% fat free) – I added 1 can condensed 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken Soup, Can’t tell the difference at all.
Used at least 1 ½ cups half-and-half
2 boxes frozen spinach - thawed
3 pre-baked medium potatoes
Used no bacon.

Cut up cooked chicken and mixed with spinach.  Spread on the bottom of 9 x 13 baking dish.
Cut up potatoes and layered on top of chicken/spinach mixture.
Covered with special sauce and toped with mozzarella – sprinkled with dried basil.
Baked at 350 until hot and bubbly and it came out DELISH

Excellent flavor; however, I did make it easier on myself by cutting the chicken into cubes and cooking separately and I actually boiled some wheat rotini.  Once it was all done, I combined chicken with spinach and mushrooms (which I added, of course) and then I combined the cooked pasta, the sauce and mixed it all together and then baked for 20 minutes.  It was delicious!

This was absolutely delicious. It was a very wholesome meal. I followed suggestions from the other reviews. I boiled the chicken first and then put it in the oven. The chicken came out very moist this way.
Also, I mixed the veggies with the sauteed stuff. I spread half the sauteed mixture in the baking dish first, set the chicken on top, and topped it off with the rest of the mixture. It came out delicious like this. Oh, and you MUST use LOTS of fresh spinach. This is a great dish! It was so easy to prep and even better to eat!

I thought the flavor was great but a little too rich.  I followed the advise of some reviewers: I sauteed fresh mushrooms and spinach (2 bags baby spinach), placed on the bottom of the casserole dish.  Then I sauteed cubed chicken (I'd use at least 5-6 breasts next time) in the same pan until it was moslty cooked, placing the chicken in the casserole.  I splashed in some white wine during these first two steps.  I then made the sauce (directions # 3 in recipe), but will use fat free half-n-half next time.  Baked the casserole for 25 min, then back in oven with crumbled real bacon & mozzarella on the top; this added a good flavor, but I see no need for the mozzarella - it was good, but it's just such a rich dish.  I may melt SmartBalance w/ breadcrumbs next time on top w/crumbled bacon.

I just made this for my Dad and Stepmom. My Dad raved and said it was a restaurant quality dish. I know that everyone tweaks recipes to their liking, and I've read many reviews stating this recipe is perfect, and other reviews stating it was either not salty enough, or too salty, or not a healthy dish, or the chicken tasted bland, etc. Here is what I did to this dish - I think the salt content is right for my taste, and its a little bit more healthy: I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil, no lemon juice, no bacon bits (ewh!), fat free half andd half, real grated parmesean cheese (no processed stuff), 1 box of frozen spinach whole leaves (drained well), and instead of italian seasoning, a mixture of majoram, rosemary, sage, thyme, andd oregano, to equal about 3/4 tablespoon. I very lightly salted the spinach (a pinch or two) and sprinkled garlic salt and white pepper on the chicken prior to it going into the oven.

Making things fast and easy, I had to change a couple of things. 
I like my chicken little, so I had to cut the chicken into cube/ bite size pieces. On the skillet (with butter and garlic), sauté for 15 minutes (or until no longer pink), season with seasoning salt & pepper. Once cooked add in olive oil, Italian seasoning, cream of mushroom soup, half-and-half, lemon juice, ½ of the mozz cheese and ½ the parmesan cheese. (Adding everything one at a time) a minute before taking off the stove add in the mushrooms, I had to double them because they’re so good.  In the glass pan spread 1 can of spinach (1 is enough) sprinkle with bacon bits and pour in the chicken mixture. Top with remaining mozz cheese and parmesan cheese. Cover and bake for 30 minutes on 350. This was so good!

Very good and my fiance loved it! I will   make again.  I had to make some changes because of the high calories and fat.  I cut the chicken in cubes and sauteed with garlic instead of baking. For the sauce, I used low-fat sour cream instead of half and half and added a splash of white wine.  I cut the butter in half, however next time I will omit it completely.  I did not use bacon.  I sauteed a bundle of fresh spinach with mushrooms and garlic. I spinkled the mozzerella cheese on top, probably using about 3/4 of a cup.   I served over angel hair pasta. Very flavorful!

I liked this, but with major tweaking. I diced the chicken and sauted it with onion and garlic powders and pepper. Will use more spice next time, including sea salt. I made 8 oz. fettucine and stirred together that, the chicken, the spinach (I used the frozen thawed spinach per other reviewers suggestions, about 8 0z.) mushrooms,and half the cheese together. I poured the sauce on top and stirred it all up. There's too much Italian seasoning for my taste, I will only use 1/2 tbsp. next time. Then I poured it all in to a 9 x 13 pan and topped with fresh bacon bits and remaining mozzarella. The bacon bits give it a nice, smoky flavor, but 1/3 cp. was plenty. Next time, I will use half the amount of chicken and twice the fettucine. Great base recipe, though!

This was really, really good. I changed a few things. I used frozen spinach instead of canned. I cut up the chicken and sauted it in olive oil with some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and S&P instead of baking it beforehand. I chopped up some shallots and added them in with the garlic (since I had some in the fridge and have been trying to use them up). I used skim milk instead of half-and-half and added the mozzarella into the sauce instead of on top. Served it with spaghetti. This was really good and very easy. I'll definitely be making this again.

Fantastic!  This was a huge hit- even with my 4 year old. I sauteed two 10 ounce bags of fresh spinach with some olive oil, salt and pepper.  I omitted the italian seasoning (by accident), and served this over penne.  It came out awesome! I also seasoned my chicken w/ salt, pepper and garlic powder. Yum Yum!  Thanks, I can't wait to have this for leftovers tomorrow.

This is a GREAT recipe.  We absolutely loved it.  It was easy too.  We eat a lot of casseroles but this had some different flavors which was a nice change of pace.  I used a 13 oz. bag of frozen spinach instead of the canned and chopped my cooked chicken up for more of a casserole effect.  I will definitely be making this again!

Good but way too rich. I will cut way back on cheese and use milk or something else instead of Half and half. Also would be helpful to give a temperature to cook chicken to in the initial bake. Chicken was overcooked after being in the oven twice

This was fantastic.  I made a few changes that I knew I would like better. I cooked the bacon and removed it from the skillet, then I cooked the mushrooms and some halved small artichoke hearts in the bacon drippings until slightly browned.  I removed the mushrooms and artichokes, and sauteed fresh baby spinach (it's what I had on hand) in the same skillet. I layered it spinach / uncooked chicken / mushrooms / artichokes / sauce / cheeese / chopped parsley.  I just cooked it until an instant read thermometer indicated the chicken was done.  We really enjoyed this and I will definately make it again.  I have no doubt the original preparation instructions are fine, but these small variations were more to my liking.

I thought this was a very good recipe although I did make a few alterations. I used 6 chicken breast halves for 6 people (in hindsight 4 would have been plenty) and cut them into big cubes. I didn't cook them ahead of time but put them raw on top of the veg and I doubled the sauce. I used two 'boxes' of organic baby spinach but it sure didn't look like much when slightly cooked so I added one big head of broccoli cut into tiny florets. I made my own Italian seasoning from a recipe on this website and had to cook it longer to get the chicken cubes in the centre of the pan cooked. I kept a close eye on it after 45 minutes to be sure the chicken was not overlooked. We served it on gluten-free penne pasta with a tossed salad. I kept all the ingredients (except for the broc) and proportions the same so the changes I made didn't really change the flavour or tone of the recipe but just made it easier to prepare.

I made this for family dinner and it was a hit.  I followed the basic recipe but made the following tweaks:  I sauteed a shallot and 3-4 minced garlic cloves then added the spinach and mushrooms to sautee.  I then put the spinach mixture in the baking dish and then added the uncooked chicken breasts.  Proceeded with the rest of the recipe and baked for about 45min at 400 degrees.  Chicken was very juicy.  Topped it with fresh chopped basil.  Added a lot of flavor!

I'm with VICSGARDEN on this one - there's no need to pre-cook the chicken and use all that cheese!  Follow his directions and you'll end up with a first rate Chicken Florentine.  In fact, this dish is so satisfying and filling, it'll stand up to any main dish I can think of, and with lots of nutrition to boot.  And, as always, the combination of flavors - chicken, cheese, mushrooms, spinach and bacon - is what makes this dish such a H-I-T at my house.

I loved this recipe. I also changed a few things. I did NOT skip step one. Rather, I salt and peppered the chicken. If you cook the chicken to temperature, it will not be dry. Second,for the white sauce, I added cream of mushroom, 5 tablespoons of butter, 1/2 cup 2% milk, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese,1/4 onion, and 3 minced garlic cloves. My husband hates mushrooms so I substitued diced tomatoes. Next, I arranged the chicken and white sauce over the spinach and tomatoes,added lots of mozzarella cheese and then I added a refrigerated pie crust brushed with egg yolk on top of all of that! Delicious.

Made this for dinner tonight. I had three large chicken breasts that I needed to stretch for dinner for five (ages 13 - 42). This recipe fit the bill perfectly.  I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand and based on prior reviews. First, I cut up the chicken, seasoned it with Emeril's Pizza and Pasta seasoning and browned it in olive oil.  While that was going, I melted butter in another saucepan and sauteed a roughly chopped onion until tender, added the mushrooms and sauteed them, then added the spinach last and heated just until wilted.  I greased a 10 inch casserole pan and spread the spinach mixture in the bottom and topped with the seasoned chicken.  For the sauce, I used the same pan that I browned the chicken in.  I used cream of mushroom soup, almond milk (that's the only kind of milk I have on hand), feta cheese (didn't have any parmesan) and bottled lemon juice.  I added more of the Emeril's seasoning and some fresh cracked black pepper.  I whisked until smooth and heated through.   I poured the sauce over the cooked chicken then topped with a pizza blend cheese (didn't have any plain mozzarella) and then topped with the precooked bacon bits.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes and it was SOOOOOOOOO good.  I think I'm going to make it like this all the time.  Thanks for posting such a versatile and forgiving recipe!!

I halved the italian seasoning (1/2 Tbsp) and used fresh spinach and mushrooms.  Still had way too much italian seasoning.  Managed to eat the leftovers, but nobody enjoyed it.  I had one that someone else made that was really good and it supposedly came from this recipe.  I don't know what they changed, but it was much better.  Definately suggest to eat over pasta or egg noodles.

Easy enough for a vegetarian to make and it got rave reviews!!!  Followed other reviews and cooked the chicken in the casserole for 30 min at 350F and then another 5 at 425F to melt the cheese.  I did add Italian style diced tomatoes to the sauce and used fat-free half and half.

Not a huge fan of canned spinach. Next time I am going fresh for sure! And the amount of cheese was a bit much! Cubing the chicken was a suggestion made by another user that I would try next time. I also used fat free half and half otherwise I think I would have gained 5 lbs after eating this! I was tempted to rate this 3 stars... after these changes, it has 4 or 5 star potential :-)

The only reason I gave this 5 stars is for all the changes I made.  This is a very fattening recipe at 647 calories per serving.  I used less butter, 1% milk, less sodium cream of mushroom.  I sauteed fresh spinach, mushrooms, garlic, and onion in olive oil and put at bottom of dish.  Then I added the chicken which I boiled.  Then I poured the white mixture on, added the fresh bacon and mozz cheese.  Next time I will mix the mozz into the other items so that it mixes better.  Great recipe, just needed a healthy touch and it tasted delicious!

Pretty good. I modified by sauteing the chicken in olive oil and separately sauteing fresh spinach, portabello mushrooms, and a large clove of garlic together. I then followed the recipe for the sauce and layering

Very good.  Gave it a 4 because I changed a bit from original recipe.  Saute spinach and mushroom in small amount of butter.  I used 2 pkgs fresh baby spinach.  Lightly browned chicken breast tenderloins in olive oil, garlic, and sprinkling of Italian herbs and then placed on top of spinach mixture.  Baked at 350 for 25 min and then added 1 cup of mozzarella cheese for 10 more minutes.  Would omit bacon next time.

Loved it!  I got a little worried while this was cooking because the smell of the Italian seasoning was so overpowering and there didn't seem to be enough sauce to cover the whole dish.  When I took the dish out of the oven, the whole thing was bubbling and cheesy and it tasted fantastic!  I used fresh spinach, just wilted it a bit on the stove first, and a mix of white and baby bella mushrooms.  I think I even used twice as many mushrooms as the recipe called for.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

DELICIOUS!!!  I made this tonight as my 7 month old son sat nearby and it was a breeze and the result was SO good!  I used a pound of chicken breast and i cubed the chicken and skipped step 1 entirely.   I used half a bag of frozen chopped spinach in place of the canned spinach, omitted the bacon bits (didnt have any) and substituted provolone for the mozzarella.  I also only used half the amt of butter called for.  I cooked at 400 degrees for 30 mins, turned it down to 350 for another 15 minutes as I had to get my son to sleep, and came back to a bubbly and browned dish of goodness.  Served with steamed fresh green beans and brown rice.  Next time I will thaw and squeeze the spinach first because it did have a lot of liquid.  Overall, very yummy!  Thanks for this recipe.  I can't wait to make it for company!

Ok so I usually stick to a recipe the first time I try it so later I can make corrections. I used the canned spinach....disaster! It smelled like formaldehyde and tasted like it too. If I made this recipe again I would definatly not use canned spinach. Although fresh wouldnt be that much better. The cream of mushroom really through it off as well. Maybe just a classic white sauce would have been better. Overall my boyfriend and I strongl disliked it! I am a cook that likes to try now recipies at least once a week and they always turn out great, not this time.

Delicious! This dish has so much flavor and is so easy and quick to make. I paired it with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Instead of canned spinach I used fresh baby spinach. Instead of chicken breasts, I used chicken tenderloins, which cooked much faster, and I cut them into bit sized pieces before adding it to the casserole. This is mine and my husband's new favorite. You know it's good when every bite you take, your eyes roll back in your head and your scraping every bit off your plate :) Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

I loved this recipe!! the combination of garlic and lemon juice was great!! I skipped the first step. I just put raw chicken in a dish and put the sauce on top of it and baked on 400 F for half an hour. then bacon and cheese in for another 10 minutes.. turned out great!!!

Normally I follow the directions the first time I make a new dish.  This time I followed the advice of other people & cut the breast into strips.  Used all the same ingredients & it turned out ok-taste wise, but a very heavy meal.  Glad I didn't use rice or noodles, no room for that.

Very tasty dish! I used a rotisserie chicken and shredded the breast meat. I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I used about 2 tsp. of Herbs de Provence. I sauteed the spinach, mushrooms, and garlic first to remove some of the moisture. I could've cooked it longer to remove more. I thought the recipe called for a LOT of cheese, so I went scant on the Parmesan (fresh grated is very salty), only used a handful of reduced fat bacon bits, and just enough freshly shredded mozzarella to lightly cover the dish. VERY tasty! We'll make this again!

I used all the ingredients as is just substituted fresh spinach and real bacon and altered the technique a bit.  After cooking the bacon I kept a couple tbls. of the bacon fat and used it to saute the spinach.  Let that drain then sauteed the mushrooms and garlic in the same pan.  Then I just added all the step 3 ingredients into the same pan and finished layering as directed.  Only other change I made was to shred my chicken breasts and used low fat soup and non fat half n half.  Loved this!!

This was very good once I made a few alterations. I used fresh spinach and no mushrooms (because I didn't have any). I didn't cook the chicken beforehand, but I cut it into strips and only cooked it in the casserole at 350 for 35 minutes (just right!). 

It came out delicious but needing a little salt and a good bit of thickening. The sauce went on VERY thick, but I think the spinach and/or chicken must have watered it down. 

Next time I'd sprinkle about 2 T of flour over the bottom of the pan and sprinkle a little salt (1/2-1t.) over the chicken. After thickening the sauce and adding a touch of salt, it was great! (I think cooking the chicken first is a bad idea - ours was done perfectly in less time.)

I don't know if I somehow messed this up, but I followed the recipe. I didn't like it, and my husband told me to never make this again. He said it left a nasty aftertaste. I will say that I like the chicken mixture before you add to spinach and mushrooms.

Wonderful recipe!  I used skim milk instead of the 1/2 and 1/2 and fresh spinach.  I also cut up my chicken breasts into small pieces and cooked them in a OO and a  little fresh garlic and italian seasoning first.  My husband told me this is his new favorite!  I tried it the next night with shrimp and he liked it, but loved the chicken version more.  Great job!

Great flavor! Next time i will cook chicken separately and then mix in together at the end, chicken was over cooked the way the recipe says to cook it. Other than that it was very yummy!

This was really good and easy.  I used some frozen pre-cook chicken strips because that is what I had on hand.  Wilted fresh spinach with the garlic and lemon juice, and used store bought bacon pieces.  It was quite yummy over angel hair pasta.  It would probably be company worthy if I had used whole chicken breasts and fresh bacon (and fresh spinach and mushrooms, of course).  Thanks for sharing.

Made the recipe with minor changes as mentioned in other reviews - sauteed mushrooms with garlic and onion and dry rubbed the chicken before baking.  Wife thought this was good enough to serve to guests.

Made almost exactly as written.  Absolutely wonderful! No mushrooms, and I added a 1/2 cup of white chardonnay wine.  One of the yummiest casseroles I have made in a while.  Definitely a keeper!  I will be talking about this one for a while!  Still can't get over just how incredibly tasty this is!  Serve to guests and you won't be let down or disappointed!!!  Highly recommend!!!!!

WOW!  This had so much flavor!  I opted to use a half a bag of fresh spinach in place of the canned.  I just put the fresh leaves on the bottom of the baking dish and it cooked wonderfully!  Cannot wait to make this again!

We made this last night but with a LOT of substitutions based on what we had.  We used shrimp as suggested by the poster, cream of chicken soup, I had mixed my herbs (basil, thyme, sage, oregano) to make Italian seasoning, milk not cream, fresh spinach wilted in a pan, no mushrooms and marble cheddar!  Looked and smelled beautiful, came out a little runny so I added some plain bread cubes I had to soak it up, and returned it to the oven for 10 min.  It was delicious and very hearty!  Try the bread cubes or even a few croutons if yours is runny too you won't be sorry!

This is really good.  I was able to put it together on a weeknight and it was on the table in about an hour.   In followed others advice and didn't bake the chicken first, but I did season it with Cajun seasoning, then seared it in a hot cast iron pan coated with olive oil.  After searing, I sliced it in thin slices.  It wasn't completely cooked through, it finished up in the oven.  I also used only one box (10 ounces) of frozen spinach instead of the two cans.   I served it over ziti.

This  is a great recipe!  I made it for a very large group (10) and it transferred beautifully.  Definitely use fresh spinach and mushrooms!  Also, I used half the mozzarella on top and it was great - and a little less cheesy.  There was plenty of sauce in the recipe to top off the fresh pasta I made to go on the side.  It was a big hit !!!

This is GREAT!  It's hard to know many stars to give the original recipe when I made it the first time based on reviewers' suggestions.  I roasted a whole chicken in an oven bag for 2 hrs 20 min.   I sauteed sliced mushrooms (16 oz) and garlic (an entire head) in butter, then added a few bags of chopped baby spinach and sauteed until it looked wilted.  I put that mixture in the bottom of a casserole dish.   I used the same frypan (deglazed with a splash of white wine) for the butter (1/4 c is WAY too much!), lemon juice, soup, Italian seasoning, half and half, and Parmesan cheese.  At this point I might try adding sundried tomatoes next time!  Follow the rest of the recipe as is, using real bacon (crumbled) - maybe more!  I baked it at 350 as recommended by other reviewers.  Next time I'll try serving over bowtie pasta.  Another reviewer suggested Harvest Cheddar Biscuits wiith this - GREAT suggestion, and great biscuits!

Delicious!  I've made this one a couple of times and since have made a couple of modifications based on previous recommenations: 1) use fresh spinach, 2) wilt spinach and mushrooms in bacon grease (I blotted the grease off before putting it in the pan so it wasn't too greasy), 3) do not cook the chicken before baking the dish, 4) I breaded the chicken breasts with Italian Panko crumbs instead of cubing the chicken.  For assembly I placed the mushrooms and spinach on the bottom, poured the sauce mixture over, then placed the chicken breast over all of that, and lastly sprinkled the cheese around the breasts.  Perfect dish, everyone loved it!

This turned out really tasty.  Instead of frozen spinach, I saute'ed  two bags of baby spinach and sliced Portabella mushrooms. This recipe made a wonderful sauce that I poured over white rice.  Will make again.

This was a reallly good recipe, albeit quite rich!  I used fresh spinach and would highly recommend it.  Next time I will be sure to cut down on the butter because the amount written is too much... puddles of melted butter are not very appetizing to me.  Thanks for sharing!

After working overtime and rushing home to quickly get supper going for the kids, I skipped step one and threw the spinach and mushrooms into the dish- I made the sauce but it looked thick so I threw in a few splashes of white wine, put half over the spinach, topped it with thin pieces of uncooked chicken breast and followed the rest of the recipe. Cooking it at 350 while the rice cooked and then 400 for 10 min. Wow, my kids ate it all- well not the spinach and mush. but the chicken and sauce. There was alot of sauce left over but not complaining. Will be making this again and again

Very yummy recipe. I used a bag of spinach leaves, didn't include additional mushrooms, took advice of another reviewer and boiled the chicken first and then placed on top spinach and sauce. Also doubled the sauce so we could dip bread with it! Great dinner!

What a great change of pace from my normal chicken casseroles! Loved it.

I, too, used fresh spinach and sauteed it with the mushrooms and chicken. And I slipped in a little cream cheese to smooth the sauce out. OK, it's not the original recipe to a tee, but the recipe is obviously great if it can take a few mods and still kick butt.

This was wonderful! It definitely took longer than 25 minutes to prep, but my husband said he liked it better than most Olive Garden dishes! We also enjoyed it reheated the next day for lunch at work.

I took some of the edits recommended in the reviews:
- Saute spinach and mushrooms and olive oil and 1/3 of the garlic. Place on bottom of dish.
- Place half of sauce on top, then raw chicken, then rest of sauce.
- Shred bacon on top.
- Bake 25 min at 350, remove from oven, top with

This was hearty and delicious! I went about cooking it a different way. I melted the butter with some minced garlic then added cubed chicken. I sprinkled salts, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, thyme, and a little Cayenne to add a special after kick! After the meat was done I added a chopped up Portobello mushroom and and 1 bag of chopped babyshpinach. Tossed spinach and mushrooms around with the chicken coating all of it in the juices. I then added the remaining ingredients plus about a half a box of cooked broken pasta. Stirred it all together, pored it in a dish, added cheese to top and baked until golden brown...AWESOME!! Definitely making it again!

This dish was so yummy and so easy to make.  Family loved it!  I did make several changes like other comments just to make recipe easier and use what I had in the fridge.  I did not use uncooked chicken (skipped step 1) I used 1 pound of frozen precooked fajita chicken strips.  So easy!!!  Used 9x13 dish.  Put 5 oz container of fresh baby spinach on bottom, then big container of fresh precut mushrooms on that,  the put frozen chicken strips on top of that, then poured mixture over entire dish.  Topped with mozzarella cheese and cut up pre-cooked bacon strips instead of bacon bits.  In the mixture I only had fat free cream of chicken soup and fat free half & half.  Was so terrific!!  Spinach looked like alot in beginning but cooked down to barely anything.  Also, I did not have italian seasoning on hand so I did not add any.  Would make this again anytime!!!!!

Yum! Wonderful recipe! I cooked my own bacon and browned the chicken in some of the drippings. I also used 2 bags of fresh spinach. After I sauteed the spinach, then the mushrooms, I made the sauce and layered in pan as directed. I baked at 350 for 20 minutes, sprinkled with the cheese and baked again to melt the cheese. One of my new favorites!

This was very good, although I didn't even have the spinach!  I cooked the chicken in the sauce in the oven.  It was served over pasta with brocolli.  My husband said it was good, but would be awesome with the spinach the recipe calls for.

WOW! Our family loved this. My boys ate it and they never eat chicken. I used frozen spinach instead of fresh and used milk and just a touch of sour cream since we were out of half and half. I also baked the chicken with the sauce over the top like a previous reviewer had recommended. This is such an EASY recipe that you can make little adjustments to as necessary. The sauce was perfect! Definitely one we will eat again!

Delish!  I made a few changes in order to use fewer pots/pans.  First I sauteed fresh mushrooms, onion, fresh minced garlic in Smart Balance and in the last few minutes I added thawed and drained frozen spinach.  I put all of that in the bottom of a sprayed 9x13 glass pan.  Next I sauteed chicken breasts cut in strips - can use chicken tenders - in the same pan with some Smart Balance just enough to get a golden color but not fully cook the chicken.  Placed the chicken on top of the spinach mix.  Then I made the sauce in the same skillet starting with a splash of white cooking wine and lemon juice, added mushroom soup and 1/2 can of half and half, Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese, sea salt and black pepper and stirred and simmered to scrape up the pan drippings into the sauce.  Poured the sauce over the chicken, topped with crumbled bacon (microwaved while making sauce) and baked 20 min @ 350.  Added mozzarella and baked 5 min more.  Served with tossed salad and warm asiago cheese bread.  Husband and our 3 teens all loved it.  Thanks Bryan!

My husband, as well as my 3,5 & 7 year old enjoyed this dish. I followed the advice of others and used fresh spinach, and mushrooms sauteed with minced garlic. I also used uncooked chicken to speed up the process. Unfortunately, I ended up having to cook the casserole for 20 more minutes anyway and had a watery dish from the chicken juices.  I would make this again, still using sauteed fresh veggies but i'd precook the chicken while preparing everything else. The sauce adds plenty of moisture to the meat. I would buy a fresh cut of Parmesian and hand grate it. The grated Parm for topping pizza is way too salty.
@ BRYANO320: great recipe, Thanks for adding it. :)

A stunning dish! I remember making this all the time years ago (5-6 yrs) until we got tired of eating it too much and my hubs is lactose-sensitive! My short cuts: I make 'AR alfredo sauce' by scratch and leave out the spinach because we dislike the canned stuff and sometimes we dont have fresh spinach on hand. I follow the rest....

I was quite pleased with this.  I made these changes: dusted with flour and pan sauteed the chicken breasts before adding them to the casserole, just because I like it that way.  I used fresh spinach and mushrooms, and in retrospect, would have left off the bacon bits (I made my own, but I thought they were unnecessary).  I served over farfalle and mini-farfalle for the toddlers and EVERYONE loved it, even the kids.

This recipe was very good and even my picky husband liked it (minus the fresh mushrooms and after I pureed the cream of mushroom soup!).  I would double the sauce next time and cook the sauce and chicken together.

We have cooked this meal several times and it is always excellent.  We fry real bacon instead of the bacon bits.  We also substitute fresh spinach instead of canned and wilted it in the same pan we use to cook the bacon.

Great recipe, thank you so much for sharing. I did make a few changes. I used gluten free cream of mushroom soup. I followed other reviewers suggestions and browned the chicken first in a skillet and then placed it on top of the mushrooms and spinach I also did not use bacon bits and it still tasted amazing.

Hubby LOVED it! Skipped 1st step. Sauté fresh spinach & mushrooms in a little butter then placed in bottom of my dish, placed uncooked chicken on top, added sauce & topped it off with real crumbled bacon (about 10 slices). Baked at 350 for 25 min. Removed from oven, topped w/1 C. mozzarella &  baked 10 minutes at 350. Yummy!

This is an amazing casserole. It's a bit labor-intensive, as far as casseroles go, but it's worth it. I made this before my son was born and froze it to have on one of those days when you can't think about making dinner. It reheated really well. I would suggest serving it over some wild rice to make a complete meal.

Very delicious!! I have made this meal several times, and like others, I use fresh spinach and skip the bacon bits. I also substitute 1/2 of the half-and-half cream with milk to make it a little less heavy. This is definately a favorite! :)

I loved this- very different, I thought, for a casserole. And low carb! I pretty much followed the recipe and the majority of the commenters. I cut up the chicken and browned it, I also sauteed the mushrooms and garlic for a bit before adding some wine, then the drained spinach. I put the spinach-mushroom mix on the bottom, but I was tempted to mix in the sauce and chicken with the spinach. I might try that next time. I also forgot the butter for the sauce. I mixed everything cold (sub. 2% milk for cream) and put it on top and it worked out great! I also crisped up some prosciutto for the bacon- yum! Personally, I think I'd like to double the spinach and maybe more of the sauce to make it more like a creamed spinach on the bottom. Can't wait to try it again soon!

I followed previous suggestions and sauted onions until they were soft, then added garlic, spinach and mushrooms. I used 8oz of mushrooms and 1 bag of spinach- will double both next time. I put the uncooked chicken on top of the onion/spinach/mushroom/garlic mixture and put the soup on top. It was good but a little bland. Next time I will try with an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and some capers. I will also add some pepper for flavor. I did not add the bacon, might try that next time as well. Served with angel hair pasta and some fresh french bread. Thank you for the recipe! I will be cooking this one again.

I have to confess, I don't really like chicken breasts... but this recipe is to die for! I made a double for 4 guests and it was gone before I could say 'seconds anyone?' I played around a bit though - cooked the bacon, then quickly seared the chicken in the juices and popped it in the microwave for 5 mins on 900W - reserved all the juices for the sauce too (so kill me, I like my cholesterol), let it cool, and chopped it before covering with sauce. Thanx, Bryan, my family loves it!

This was pretty good. I think I will use fresh spinach next time. And I served it over miniature farfalle (bowtie pasta) with a side of fresh veggies.  I liked this and so did the family. A keeper.

I thought this was great!  I did follow the modifications suggested by other reviewers (sauted the mushrooms and spinach with some garlic) - I also browned the chicken with some Italian seasoning and olive oil and put some cookied fettucine noodles in the bottom of the pan before layering the spinach/mushrooms, chicken, sauce, and cheese.  Very tasty!

I prepared it as many other suggested:  sauteed fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms (I used olive oil), spread out spinach and mushroom mixture in casserole dish, topped with uncooked chicken (I diced the chicken into bite sized pieces), then poured the sauce over everything, topped it with bacon (I fried my own), and baked for 25-30 minutes.  I took it out, topped it with a combination of mozzerella cheese and parmesan cheese (I didn't have a full cup of mozzerella on hand) and put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  This dish was good but I did add small amounts of seasoning salt to the spinach and mushrooms while cooking them, as well as to the raw chicken after I diced it up.  This recipe didn't call for any salt at all which was hard for me to believe.  This dish turned out good with the addition of a little salt.  I guess with the cream of mushroom soup (which can be salty depending on what else you use with it), cheeses and bacon, it doesn't seem like it should need any salt.  I am not a salt person but do like seasoned food.  Overall, this was a good dish.  The sauce was very good and I served this dish with a side of angel hair Pasta Roni.  I would definitely make this again and would probably add a little cayenne pepper or something else spicy to the sauce mixture.

This recipe was soooo good!!! I used the suggestions from other reviewers, by not cooking the chicken first, using fresh spinach and bacon. It was the best thing I have ever cooked. YUMMY. Even my husband who hates both spinach and mushrooms LOVED this!! Don't miss out on it!!!

Absolutely delicious!! Doing as other reviewers suggested, skipped baking the chicken, sauteed spinach and mushrooms in butter, then layered spinach,mushrooms,half the sauce,uncooked chicken breasts and poured remaining sauce on top-baked at 350 for 30 minutes, topped with a lot of mozzarella and continued to bake for another 20 minutes ( I used pretty thick chicken breasts). I also substituted 1/2 cup milk for the half and half, based on other reviewers stating it was too rich with the half and half. This is the best recipe I've tried from allrecipes and I am so glad I did!!! This is going to be on my regular rotation at least every two weeks...thank you so much for sharing!!

We loved this!!! After reading several reviews, I used frozen spinach instead of canned and put the chicken in raw. The house smelled great as it was baking and it tasted fabulous. Thanks for the recipe! I'm sure this will be made over and over again.

The overall idea of this recipe was excellent and my family will eat it.  Hooorrayy!!  I made some changes to make it healthier for my family.  I also incorporated suggestions from other reviewers.  I lightly browned chicken in some olive oil for a couple of minutes.  Removed the chicken to a plate; added 3t garlic, 1/4 onion & mushrooms to chicken pan to saute in chicken juices until onion was translucent.  Added a bag of fresh spinach to the pan and cooked until just wilted.  In a separate bowl I combined skim milk, parm. cheese & Campbells heart healthy cream of mushroom soup.  Then I mixed sauce into spinach.  I layered a little sauce in the bottom of an 8x8 pan, placed chicken on top and then poured the rest of the spinach sauce on top.  I sprinkled approx 1/3 cup of bacon bits and 1 Cup of Mozzarellla cheese on top.  Baked at 400 for approx 40 minutes.  Personally, I use a meat thermometer and removed from oven when it reached 165 degrees.  I had to lightly cover with foil the last 10 minutes to keep cheese from over-browning.  I accidentally left out the italian seasoning and purposefully left out the lemon juice.  It was a GREAT dinner!  Thank you!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because, like many suggested, I changed a few things & it was AMAZING!! My husband raved about this dinner for days, and Im making it again for a friend of mine today. Instead of baking the chicken, i took others' advice & sauteed the mushrooms & spinach before adding them to the baking dish. LOVED the flavor & what an easy & healthy meal!

This was a great meal and really good!  I used about 5 large chicken breasts and I doubled the sauce mixture.  Instead of canned spinach, I used frozen, and only about 10 oz of it.  Since we dont care for mushrooms, I added chopped onion in place of it, and sauteed them before making the sauce mixture.  This came out real well and we really liked it.  Im sure I will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the suggestions of VICSGARDEN, and I found this recipe amazing!  I didn't have any fresh mushroom so I omitted those.  I did pound my chicken breast thin.  Also, I ran out of mozz. cheese and only had 1/2 cup, so I used slices of provolone and then sprinkled the 1/2 c. of mozz. on top.  I will def. make this again.  It was so quick and so tasty!

Thanks for a great base recipe!  I pre-cooked the chicken breasts as recommended. Then I drained the spinach and sauteed in olive oil with garlic and red pepper flakes (no mushrooms, hubby's not a fan). For the sauce I used milk instead of half and half, and I increased the milk to a full cup. I used juice of half a lemon instead of 1 Tbl. I also melted 1/2 cup mozz cheese right into the sauce. Everything else for the sauce I went by the recipe. I used leftover rice pilaf (about a cup and a half) as the bottom layer in a 9 x 12 pan, topped with the spinach, then half the sauce, then the cut up chicken breasts, and the rest of the sauce. Baked for 20 minutes at 400, topped with bacon and 1 1/2 c mozz, baked for 20 min more. Delish. Next time I'd nix the bacon, it didn't add much flavor and I didn't love the crunchy texture. Great recipe!

This was so good and so easy.  I used a bag of fresh spinach since I didn't even know there was such a thing as canned spinach (eww) and I was in a hurry and didn't want to defrost the frozen type.  I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom rather than plain mushroom.  I may try the  mushroom next time  just to see the difference in taste.  I did as another reviewer suggested and didn't cook the chicken first and saw no problem with that but I did increase the cooking time to 40 mins.  For the cheese I used a big of shredded cheese that had a mix of about 5 different cheeses.  Next time might cut chicken into bite sized pieces first and then I could reduce cooking time a little and will definitely make rice to serve it on.  Lots of yummy sauce!  Because of the time crunch I also just sprinkled 2-3 tbsp. of Bacos and it was fine.  Another plus....my picky 18 yr old daughter thought it was really good....she rarely says that.

I made this using the changes suggested by others.  I did not precook the chicken, I cut down on the Italian seasoning (only 1 teaspoon), used frozen spinach instead of canned, used milk instead of cream, and used real bacon.  It smelled delicious, and the taste was quite nice, but...  This was far too rich and fatty for us.  The 1/4 cup of butter in the sauce makes it very greasy.  It was also too soupy and we found the garlic to be overpowering.  If you have issues with fatty foods or rich foods, stay away from this one!  My poor husband was up in the bathroom during the night.  I also ended up with a "rich" feeling in my stomach.   I really wanted to love this one, especially given the rave reviews.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't right for us.

I made this for Father's Day and everyone raved at how different and tasty it was.  The only diffence is I doubled all ingredients except I used 3 cans of spinach instead of 4 and used 1 cream of mushroom soup and 1 cream of chicken soup.  I used baby bella mushrooms, cooking them and the spinach in light butter before spreading in a lasagna pan.  I also lightly cooked the chicken in some olive oil before placing on the spinach layer. Cooked at 350 for 30 minutes topped with 1.5 cups mozzerella cheese, then added the other .5 cup for the last 10 minutes.  Served over white rice with a salad and italian bread, this recipe makes a truly delicious meal!  Thanks.

This was delicious.  Family loved it.  Followed other reviewers suggestions about the chicken and spinach prep.  Cut chicken into bite size pieces - uncooked. Sauted spinach in butter and placed on bottom of baking dish topped by the raw chicken.  Made sauce and poured over chicken/spinach topped with bacon bits.  Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then topped with cheese, baked until cheese was melted and slightly browned on top.  Wonderful.   Used lowfat/low sodium soup.  Cut the Italian seasoning in 1/2.  If not serving to children, I would keep the chicken filets whole instead of cutting them up.

Great recipe! About the canned vs. fresh spinach... its not so much that the canned spinach ruins the recipe, as much as it is simply a different flavor.  Canned spinach has a very distinct flavor and if you like it okay, then you will like it in this recipe just fine.  Clearly, fresh spinach is not, um... canned tasting, and therefore much more flavorful.  However, if all you have is canned, or frozen for that matter, and you don't mind the taste, then it will taste just fine.

Absolutely great!!! I just made this recipe for dinner w/ a few of the suggested changes. My family and I loved it and I will be making this again. I skipped the 1st step. Cooked my cut up chicken in evoo, then sauteed onions, garlic, and mushrooms in evoo. I then added the sauce made as directed w/frozen spinach thawed and substituted mozzarella. I poured this over the chicken and heated in oven for 25 minutes w/ more cheese and bacon added the last 10 minutes. Served over thin spaghetti and served w/ garlic bread. Totally Awesome!

I made this recipe twice.  Once as shown and once with fresh ingredients (baby spinach and real bacon).  I also doubled the mushrooms.  As is, it is a four plus star in my opinion, but with the changes, five star no doubt.  Excellent recipe!

Great flavor!! I did make a few changes. Used frozen chopped spinach, olive oil instead of butter, whole milk instead of cream. Left out the bacon bits. Cooked the raw chicken right on top of the spinach mix for 25 minutes at 350 then topped with cheese for another 10 minutes..did actually broil it to brown the cheese for a minute or two only. This could be a family favorite!!

This recipe was really good!  My Fiance hates canned spinach, but he ate this up! My 14 month old liked it too. I didn't have half n' half or cream so I used milk in its place.  Was still scrumptious though!  This will go in my recipe box.  = )

I was very shocked that this recipe was not all that I expected. It was ok...and my 17 year old daughter liked it...but it really didn't WOW me.  I'm not much on canned soup recipes...but after all the rave reviews I thought I had found a real gem...NOT... It was decently edible...but no major WOW factor at all.

This was very good- I tweaked it a bit, to suit our tastebuds. 1) Used 2 10 pkgs. of cooked roasted chicken breast strips. 2) Sauteed the mushrooms & garlic in the butter, than added soups. One each cr. of mushroom & cr. of chicken. 3) Stirred in 2 tsp. Italian seasoning, the parmesan, and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice. 4) Added the parmesan, chicken, and about 2/3 of a pint of half & half. Tastes as I went, which was KEY! 5) Placed a layer of thawed frozen spinach into 9x13 dish. Poured the chicken/soup mixture over spinach. 6) Topped with 1 bag of real bacon pieces and then 8 oz. shredded mozzarella. 7) Covered, baked 30 mins, then 10 mins. more uncovered. I served fresh fettucini on the side, and it was a hit!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved it! Only changed couple of things: used chicken tenders that I browned first; used fresh spinach and sauteed spinach with mushrooms in pan used for chicken. I only baked for 15 mins. My dad, who doesn't really eat chicken, had seconds!

This, my friends, is comfort food of the highest order! I doubled the spinach, using defrosted frozen as I think canned would make this far too salty. I tinkered with the amounts of the other ingredients to make enough for six. It was utterly devoured by my dinner guests. Though not exactly heart-healthy, for the occasional fat and calorie splurge this is almost unbeatable! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was absolutley fantastic! I did make the following changes: browned chicken on stovetop first, cooked spinach and mushrooms in a little butter (1 tbsp.) and garlic. Followed the sauce exactly, except omitted the lemon juice and used fat free milk and reduced fat soup (turned out FANTASTIC!).  Then I did combine everything together before baking.  Also omitted the bacon.  Baked 25 mins and then sprinkled with mozz. cheese and baked 10 more minutes. Husband absolutely LOVED this recipe!  Thanks!

This was very good.  As suggested I reduced the italian seasoning by half and it was still a little strong for me.  I also used fresh spinach and opted not to use mushrooms.  Browing the chicken on the stove worked great as the chicken was nice and juicy when the casserole came out of the oven.

Served this to my family who usually like my cooking....but this recipe was outstanding.  It got instant praise.  I would highly recommend it for entertaining family & friends. I used two bags of fresh spinach (slightly steamed) and 1/2 lb. of bacon fried crisp and crumbled.  I also shared this recipe with 5 people I work with...all were extremely pleased with it.  FANTASTIC was the phrase used.

I made this recipe last night and I have to say it is the best chicken recipe I have made in a long while.  I used fresh spinach instead of the canned and sauteed it with butter, lemon juice and garlic salt.  Followed the rest of the recipe as directed and it was fantastic.  Highly recommended.

We love this recipe.  I make a few changes to cut down on the fat though.  I use milk instead of half and half and skip the bacon.  I also use about half the amount of mozzarella on top - just to avoid overdoing it.  I double the amount of spinach (fresh instead of canned) because it cooks away to almost nothing otherwise.  A quick and yummy dinner!

This recipe was wonderful. Really easy to make and looked great coming out of the oven. I took the advice from some other reviews and seasoned the chicken with garlic powder before baking. I also used fat free soup, and fat free half and half. You really can't tell the difference and it helps cut back on calories and fat. I served this dish with warm breadsticks and Ceasar salad. I will be using this recipe again, and again. Thanks.

This is great!  I made a few adjustments though- I added extra italian seasoning and browned the chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic instead of baking them.  It sealed in the juices and made the chicken much more tender. I also used fresh baby spinich instead of canned. Fresher is always better. And I used a blend of parmesean, asagio and romano cheese. I think next time I am going to only use 1 cup of mozzerella instead of the 2 called for. I think it was too much.  Made it really thick and not as gooey as I would have liked.  My husband loved it.  This is good stuff!

I made this dish for dinner and I thought it was pretty good.  I read the other reviews and decided to reduce the salt by buying low soduim bacon.  The flavor was good, but if I made it again I would definately use fresh spinach or reduce the amount of canned spinach. Two 13.5 oz cans is a lot of greenery for a 9x9" baking dish.  I would also increase the amount of sauce (by adding a little homemade white sauce--not more canned soup) so it could be served over noodles or rice without adding to the salt content. I would also sautee the mushrooms a smidgen--or slice them a bit thinner.

My family all liked this recipe!  Two of us thought the Italian seasoning should be cut in half, the other two liked it as is.  We increased the amount of sauce a little so as to serve it over rice.  We used fresh frozen mushrooms and fresh spinage and it turned out great. A little salty but that may be because we used fresh cooked bacon.  Definately a "keeper" recipe!

This recipe is one of the very best. My family is quite picky and everyone loved it, including me. I did sprinkle the chicken breasts with Italian seasoning when I put them in the oven to bake. I do think that I am going to try fresh spinach leaves next time. This made such a wonderful meal to serve to my family, thank you!

We love this recipe with one major adjustment. I loathe canned mushroom soup,  so using AR's "Cream of Mushroom Soup 1 recipe. After cooking I added the lemon juice freeze dried garlic, and Italian seasoning. I used a 9 x 13 baking dish because of the extra volume, a pound and a half of Tyson chicken breast. We and our guests agreed it was one the finest dishes any of us had ever had. Can't wait to try it with a Cod and Shrimp mixture.

This is an excellent and easy recipe. You can change it up to whatever your preferences are. Fresh spinach does make a difference. Twice the garlic for real white sauce fans. Today no mushrooms because I will be making stuffed mushrooms on the side. Cut up the chicken first and skip the pre-cook method because it will boil in the oven. Throw it over fettuccini. Try shrimp thrown in at the end for the seafood lovers.

This would have been 5 stars (and I'm sure it deserves it) but I took the advice of many of the previous reviewers when it came to cooking times and pre-baking the chicken at 350° (step #1) vs skipping step #1 and simply baking it raw as part of the final dish. Everything else I followed exactly as spelled out in the original recipe (Oops... I also used real crumbled bacon as opposed to bacon bits). I will make this again because even though the chicken wasn't cooked completely, I was able to nuke it long enough to finish the job and the taste was great!

So freaking good. I had to use almond milk instead of half and half, and I followed the suggestion of laying out the spinach, the raw chicken on top, then sauce, and cooking for 25 minutes at 350, adding cheese and going for another 10. Served over rice and it was delicious! Thank you for a great recipe!

Awesome, when you modify based on previous comments. I sautee the spinach, mushrooms and garlic and place it at the bottom of the dish. Then I layer half the mozzarella over that. Cubed, uncooked chicken goes over that. Then sauce layer - I use skim milk instead of half & half and it's fine. Bake 25 min at 350. Then the rest of the mozzarella on top for 10 min. I usually serve with buttered noodles.

I was so looking forward to making this dish for my family. I made only a couple of changes that I think made it a little better than it would have been. I sautéed the chicken only long enough to brown it, and baked with everything else for 25 minutes, and then 10 minutes after the mozzarella was added. I used a bag of fresh spinach because I don't like any canned vegetables, and used milk instead of half and half. Other than these modifications, I followed the rest of the ingredients list to the letter. 

I may try this recipe again. I will make some of the suggested changes from other reviewers, and make some of my own. I will stay with using milk instead of half and half. The sauce was plenty rich with milk. The chicken was moist and tender. So I would do that the same and also use fresh or frozen spinach instead of canned. The amount of bacon bits was far too much. They made the dish much too salty. Next time, I will use crumbled real bacon or leave out the bacon all together. I think I would also reduce the amount of Parmesan cheese to 1/3 cup. Flavors in a sauce should blend and compliment, and I could single out the Parmesan cheese. I would also greatly reduce the amount of mozzarella cheese. The recipe calls for 2 cups. I used one cup and it was still way too much. I love mozzarella cheese, but this was overpowering. 

Neither my husband or I could eat this. We scraped off the chicken and picked out the spinach. This recipe has possibilities, but not as written.

I thought this recipe looked good and knew instantly that I'd need to make a few tweaks (i just don't do bacon bits).  Here is what i changed: 
1. low fat cream of mushroom
2. 1/2 cup of 1% organic milk (half n half is just too rich)
3. 2 bags of fresh spinach (i sauteed them in batches.  I just prefer fresh to canned)
4. 8 oz of fresh mushrooms (i also sauteed these before putting them in the dish)
5. 4 slices of bacon instead of the bacon bits
6. 1 cup of mozzarella cheese

Also, instead of pre baking the chicken breasts I sauteed them per others suggestions in the comments.  My dad and I agreed (i brought him some leftovers) that I should reduce the garlic (maybe 1 tsp of fresh minced garlic instead of 3).

Really excellent recipe. I did use the fresh spinach. Also used sauteed fresh mushrooms and half an onion. I made it Friday night and didn't cook it (except the chicken) until Saturday evening for dinner. I will be making this again, thank you.

This was great!! I made a few changes with what was on hand. I also doubled the recipe so I could share with my neighbor. I used a can of cream of jalapeno soup and a can of cream of poblano soup instead of the mushroom soup. I also used fresh spinach instead of canned and Lactaid milk instead of half-and-half since my husband is lactose intolerant. This is on my favorite list!!

This recipe was very good and so easy.  I used fresh baby spinach because I don't like the flavor of canned.  When I make this again I will double the spinach since I did not take into account how much it cooks down.

This was wonderful! I made a couple of changes as others suggested. I skipped step 1 and just cooked the chicken in a pan with a little oil and chopped it into cubes. I also sauteed the spinach and mushrooms. I used frozen spinach, thawed and drained, and mini bella mushrooms sliced. I also added about half of a large white onion. I wish I added more mushrooms b/c the taste was amazing. I also mixed the sauce with the chicken after it was cooked and threw it all at once (over the spinach mix) I used about 1.5 cups of mozz cheese and that was plenty. Served over spaghetti noodles and it was amazing!

Loved it!  I did fry bacon and sauteed fresh spinach in the bacon grease. After removing spinach, I added a bit of olive oil and cooked my chicken(cut up)in same skillet.  Added some of my own dried seasonings (oregano, basil and parsley)to the sauce mixture.  I didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 so just used 2 percent milk. I had to use canned mushrooms as all I had on hand. I will definitely be making this recipe again.  Thanks for posting, BRYAN0320!

This is good, really good. I did change a few things like everyone else;
I used frozen spinach and combined it into the soup mixture, just to lose a step. I also read someone served it over bow-tie noodles, so I boiled some noodles and put it in the bottom of my casserole dish. Then I put the chicken chunks, soup mixture, bacon bits and cheese. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 dish. Will make again!

I get so many compliments when I make this.  I modify it slightly, but you really don't have to.  I usually use left over fried chicken breast that I cube.  I fry up around 5 strips of bacon, and then make the sauce with the bacon grease adding maybe a tbs of butter instead of a 1/4 cup.  Some cream cheese goes into that because at this point we're not counting calories :)  Instead of parmesan I just use one of those bags of shredded italian cheese for both the sauce and topping.  One box of frozen spinach is all I add, and I omit the mushrooms (I'm the only one who eats them).  No layering, just mix it all together.  Eat, run 5 miles, then have a heart attack.  Totally worth it!

This recipe is delicious.  The first time I made it, I did use bacon as the recipe directs, but my family didn't care for the bacon.  Ever since then I have omitted it.  Also, I double the sauce (one extra can of mushroom and another 1/2 cup of half and half) to have extra sauce to pour over pasta.  I also modify the recipe by browning the chicken in olive oil vs. baking in oven.  We really love this recipe and it is a nice alternative to Chicken Alfredo.  YUM!!

I made the recipe as follows and the chicken was tough to cut and kind of rubbery... and the sauce was a little too runny (though I think that was my fault - I did drain the spinach, but perhaps not enough). Had I known it would be so runny, I'd've made pasta to serve with it. 

I'll try it again, but will not pre-cook the chicken, just cut it into thin strips.

I also skipped baking the chicken ahead of time and just mixed it in with the casserole as others here suggested. It was so delicious this way.  Very flavorful and so easy.  My whole family liked it.  Will make again!

Loved the sauce!  I wish I had cubed the chicken like some others said they did.  I baked it all together and didn't prebake the chicken.  Sauteed fresh spinach with the mushrooms.  The spinach and mushrooms with the sauce was divine, I could have eaten a bowl of that alone.  Next time I make this will have to try and cube the chicken or prebake it.  It just didn't get done the way I wanted it to.

The flavor and taste that this recipe produces is very good, but my biggest complaint is that I don't know what the meal is supposed to be. If it's a casserole, it should have a starch in it (rice) and preferably some more vegetables. Without the starch, it's not uniform like a typical casserole dish--it's just chicken in a very liquidy sauce (albiet tasty). If it's just a regular chicken dish with a nice sauce, it should just be cooked in a pan on the stovetop. My cooking level is definitely a beginner, so maybe everyone else knew what to expect. I just expected a casserole due to the title of the dish.

This dish is phenomenal! Big hit at my dinner party.  I ended up doubling the recipe.  Instead of canned spinach I used frozen.  Also - I only sprinkled enough mozzarella cheese on the top to cover my casserole dish and didn't need as much as it called for.  After cooking the chicken I sliced mine into large pieces which made it easier to dish out for a group.

Tim loved it. Made it end of February 2012. I thought it only ok. Used fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach and added paprika. I think next time do not use the spinach at all. It got over cooked. Served over egg noodles.

I thought this was basically a good recipe.  I used fresh spinach instead of canned, turkey bacon instead of pork to please one family member, and omitted the mushrooms to please another (substituted cream of chicken soup for the mushroom soup).  Although we all liked the casserole, I think we did not love the strong Italian seasoning flavor.  Next time, I may omit the seasoning and lemon juice and try white wine and parsley instead.

Awesome!  I would use two bags of spinach for a total of 12 oz. and then 8oz. of mushrooms. Otherwise there isn't much substance besides chicken. Definitely follow the reviewer's advice to sautee raw spinach with the mushrooms, and put the chicken in the casserole uncooked.

This was a very easy recipe but REQUIRES fresh spinach. I tried canned for the first time with this and ate around the spinach. Will make again :)

This recipe is surprisingly simple but still has a restaurant taste that will leave you completely satisfied. We served it over a bed of angel hair pasta and used the sauce mix as a gravy. So very scrumptous!

Yuck! This was not to my liking at all. To quote my husband's comment, "If a recipe calls for canned spinach, move on to the next one." I couldn't agree more and wish I would have taken that into consideration BEFORE making this. I think fresh or frozen (chopped) spinach would be a MUCH better choice, but didn't substitute it for two reasons - I like to avoid making unnecessary changes to a recipe the first go around and (BIG reason) because so many reviews raved about how good this was (anyone who can rave about canned spinach wins my vote). To be fair, I did make one needed change (at least I think so...). Instead of baking my chicken first, I just layered it in my casserole dish and baked at 350 for 35 minutes. I feared my chicken would dry out otherwise. This is the first time in a LONG while that my husband and I didn't eat more than one bite of our dinner. We made a meal out of the Parmesan noodles and garlic bread I served on the side: :( Maybe this will float your boat, but it certainly didn't ours. Thanks anyways, Bryan! :-)

Delicious!! I used fresh spinach, real bacon and added raw shrimp and served over angel hair pasta.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of milk to the sauce so it would be less thick.  Amazing!

I made this as one of my Christmas main course meals and it was wiped out in a matter of minutes! Even people who were wary of spinach loved this.I did take the advice of other reviewers, and sauteed the chicken, and the spinach and mushrooms separately. Thanks for this recipe- will be making again as I really didnt get my fair share!

This is a spin of a recipe called Chicken a la Maria from Better Homes & Gardens (1980s).  Four boneless chicken breasts, dredge in flour.  Then into Italian bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese.  Place in oven pan. Omit cream of mushroom soup (and if you must have mushrooms, use fresh and saute as below with green onions), make your own Bechamel sauce: In pan melt 3 Tablespoons butter add  one bunch chopped green onions, the when lightly browned add 1/4 cup chopped ham.  Add 3 Tablespoons flour, brown well.  Add 1 cup apprx.(i use skim!) milk and stir 'till thickened to your liking. Add 1 box (thawed) frozen spinach.  Top with 1/4 cup Parmesan and four pats butter.  Google Chicken a la Maria for exact recipe - it is PERFECT! But please see:  http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1639,157183-234199,00.html

This was delicious--I couldn't get enough of it.  I used frozen spinach and 2% milk and left out the bacon bits.  I put everything in the pan and poured the sauce over the top.  I served it over spaghetti and on my,  I think I'll make it again today!

Really enjoyed this dish, but I will definitely use fresh spinach next time!  I have an issue draining canned spinach and you could taste it in this casserole. I took the advice of others: cubed the chicken, cooked it partially in the bacon grease, then followed the recipe as written.  This is definitely a keeper and I am looking forward to getting this one just right!

WOW! This recipe was DELISH!! My husband and children both loved this meal!! I bolied my chichen breast tenders and used fresh spinach, 2% milk for the sauce and skipped on the bacon (cause I didnt have any) I bet it will be even more amazing with a little bit of bacon. May not be the most health conscious food, but you can cut back by using less cheese and skipping on the bacon. Enjoy!

This was an excellent dish. The only thing I didn't do was add the bacon. Everything else was on hand My picky tween loved it! Took seconds even after I told her it had spinach and mushrooms in it! Definetly a keeper.

This was amazing. I added cooked pasta, mixed it up with fresh spinach (sauteed with butter), and placed cut up uncooked chicken on top. My pickiest eater asked for seconds.

I basically used this recipe for the sauce because I didn't have spinach or mozzarella cheese. I used diluted gluten-free creamy mushroom soup, which I thickened by adding cornstarch to the milk before stirring it in. I also took another reviewer's suggestion and fried up some bacon, cut up the chicken, and cooked it in the bacon fat. I served the creamy chicken mixture over brown rice topped with crumbled bacon and it was fantastic. My only complaint is there was a bit too much Italian seasoning for my liking, and I only used two teaspoons.

I made this for supper last night and I have to say it's Wonderful! I did make a few changes. 1)I cut the chicken into bite size pieces, cooked that on the stove with some olive oil and the mushrooms. 2) After the chicken was no longer pink I added the rest of the ingredients but only 1 cup of mozz. cheese, and I used 1% milk, cooked until all was bubbly. 3) poured it all into the dish on top of the spinach (used frozen spinach and it was fine) topped off with the last cup of mozz. cheese and spinkled with Parmasean cheese. Put it in the oven at 400 for 25 mintues.I served it Al Dente spinach fettuccine noodles.

Easy and good. I would cut up the chicken into cubes. Also I wouldnt put the chicken in by itself as long because it gets rubbery. I would cut the cheese to 1 cup. Other than thats I will make again

This was a great recipe but WAY TOO salty and I like salty foods. Between the butter, bacon, cream of mush, cheese and parm something could be changed without compromising on the flavor too much. Next time I think I will use olive oil and omit the bacon. For me this is a great start to a dinner staple with slight modifications. Thanks for sharing.

Really, really good.  I think next time I'll do 1/2 tbsp of Italian seasoning as opposed to a tbsp.  Besides that, amazing!

Great recipe! Tried it with shrimp and it tasted awesome! The bacon bits added great flavor and I think adding milk to the sauce will make it more soupy than thick like mine was which seemed like a complaint. Definitely need to dry fresh washed spinach or it will be watery on the bottom. great stuff!

Great Recipe! I used frozen (drained) spinach instead of canned, came out fantastic. Next time I think I'm going to to try adding some pasta in the casserole (instead of on the side).

Sorry, but we didn't like this at all.  I'm right now washing the sauce off in order to salvage good chicken breasts.

This recipe was SO GOOD! My husband and I do not like mushrooms at all but I decided to try them in this recipe anyways. We both loved it, we did pick around the mushrooms but they gave it great flavor!! I did make some revisions.
1) cut the chicken into cubes and cook with EVOO and the minced garlic and 1/2 of the italian seasoning, until the outside is white.
2) After the chicken is white on the outside, add the soup (I used cream of chicken & mushroom mix), half-and-half (or milk), lemon juice, 1/2 of the italian seasoning,  and 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese.
3)Start to boil 1 box of noodles of your choice.
4)I used a bag of frozen spinach and put that on the bottom of my baking dish (used 9x13 instead). Then covered with a thin layer of mushrooms. and Added the chicken mix. On top I crumbled real bacon, added the rest of the mozzarella cheese, and sprinkled parmesan on the top.
5) Bake for 20 min. the last 6-8 I put in garlic bread.
6)For presentation I put noodles on the bottom of a round platter with curved edges. Added the chicken florentine bake on top. Then put the garlic bread on the edges.

This was awesome! I added about half of an onion in with the mushrooms to saute, and used a container of frozen spinach. I layered everything over a bed of pasta for a complete meal/casserole and cooked for 20 minutes- perfect!

This is a good recipe; I made a few changes.  As someone else suggested, I also chopped the chicken into cubes and cooked it in a pan instead of baking it in the oven.  Also, I felt the canned spinach gave the dish a funny taste, so I would suggest using fresh baby spinach leaves instead.  They can be quickly stir fried on the stove beforehand to make them soft.  But this was still a really good dish and my friends really enjoyed it!

Wonderful taste!!  Only problem is I doubled this receipe and it actually made more sauce then needed.  I will make this again, but maybe adjust my servings so I don't waste ingredients.

This was delicious!  I didn't think it was really something my husband would like, but he did. He was even shocked how much he liked it.  It was very easy to make on tope of it!  It was a little too much sauce.  I couldn't use it all. I did follow reviews and only cook chicken once, on top of spinach.  Though it isn't exactly a kid friendly dish all of my kids did like it.....with the exception of the mushrooms. :-)  We will definitely be making this again.

It's a keeper, but I'm thinking that marinating the chicken first would taste a little better.

My family loved this; it was flavorful and unusual- it does taste fancy!  Following others' suggestions I boiled the chicken first and used fresh ingredients rather than frozen...Also I added diced onions to my sauteed spinach and mushroom mix. I'll make this again-and again, but will serve over bow tie pasta in the future.

4-stars as-is.  I made some of the modifications mentioned in the comments.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it in butter with the mushrooms.  I skipped the first step in the recipe all together and baked the chicken directly with the rest of the casserole.  Next time, I will use real bacon.

Delicious use of leftover chicken and surprisingly not "cream soup"-like! Sautéed fresh spinach, mushrooms and garlic in a little butter and olive oil; laid in bottom of casserole dish. Made sauce in same sauté pan. Layered sauce over spinach mixture, then cut up chicken, and rest of sauce. Bacon and half of mozzarella cheese. 350 for 25 min covered; added rest of cheese, 10 min uncovered. Served over pasta.

My husband cannot stop raving about this dish.  It was a little to much spinach for us, but the sauce was AMAZING.  I made it like a previous reviewer suggested and cooked the chicken IN the casserole at 350 degrees for 25 min then again another ten.  Great Job

This recipe is excellent. I changed a few things.....used fresh spinach (2 bags) cooked down in couple tablespoons of butter, put that in the bottom of the glass dish, uncooked chicken on top of that, followed with the sauce. To the sauce, I added a splash of white wine......To die for recipe!

I followed some of the other reviewers advise & cut chicken into bite sized pieces, sauteed w/garlic & butter, used fresh spinach and lime juice. It was delicious! Very "saucy" for a casserole, so I served it over pasta. Definitely a keeper recipe!

This recipe is a keeper.  My family enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe with only minor changes.  I used two bags of fresh spinach and 2% milk instead of half and half.  I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the chicken into bite size pieces and sauted in bacon drippings.  I added the spinach and the other ingredients and cooked on low for 10 minutes.  I poured the mixture into a pan. Sprinkled with bacon bits and cheese and baked for 25 minutes. I served on top of our favorite pasta with parmesan sprinkled on top.

I doubled this recipe for a party I was having. I didn't really care for it. There was too much spinach and it needs pasta or rice or something to hold it together.

AMAZING! This is a great recipe! I took the advise of a few other reviewers and did the following: Cubed the chicken into bite size peices and cooked them in a little EVOO first. Used a whole bag of fresh spinach and 8 oz of fresh mushrooms also added a whole sliced onion, cooked the spinach, mushrooms and onion (in EVOO) until the spinach wilted, then followed the directions as stated in the recipe. My husband doesn't care much for chicken, but loved this recipe and requested this become a regular in our house! : )
Thank you for sharing this w/ us!!

Yum! Like other reviewers, I cubed the chicken and sauteed it in the bacon grease from the bacon. I also added chopped red pepper to the spinach and I used 1% milk instead of half and half. I would definitely make this again.

This was a pretty good recipe, but I wish it would have told you to serve it with something like rice or pasta.  I am now reading other reviews that tell you to do that and I agree that would have made it better.  Also I didn't care for the Italian seasoning, it seemed to overwhelming.

I forgot to buy half and half and just used skim milk.  Still very good but my husband and I both thought there was too much salt and Italian Seasoning.  Is there salt in Italian Seasoning?

Firstly I used turkey bacon (instead of regular bacon), then used the same pan to lightly saute the chicken with onions & garlic before adding the sauce.  I stirred the sauce mixture into the casserole dish with the chicken/bacon mix, and added some finely chopped broccoli too for some extra taste & texture.  Delicious!

This was good but I'm not a huge spinach fan.  I think that next time I would use maybe 1 can and would consider fresh spinach...canned spinach just doesn't taste great.  Other than that it was good!

I served this to my family and a friend. We all really enjoyed it. This recipe sounds wonderful as is; however, like others, I added my own twists. 1) Diced and cooked chicken on stove, being careful not to overcook it. 2) I combined the mushrooms with the sauce. 3) I boiled penne pasta al dente and used the pasta as the bottom layer. 4) Added freshly ground pepper. This is a great recipe. Thank you so much for sharing! It's now a family favorite!

Great dish.  I used fresh baby spinach which I blanched first in the microwave, added an 8 oz layer of sliced baby bellas, and used a whole organic chicken, which I separated and skinned.  My wife thought it was great as she was getting tired of BBQ'ed.

This was very tasty!  I did a couple things differently...first, I  marinated the chicken pieces in an Italian dressing for about an hour and then I pan fried them until nearly done.  I figured as long as I would be baking the chicken, it didn't have to be well done before I added it to the casserole.  I sliced the chicken pieces after removing from the skillet. I used the same pan that I sauteed the chicken to saute the garlic and then added the soup, a half can of Half & Half (about a cup), about a cup of finely grated parmesan (hand grated) and a 6 oz. jar of mushrooms, drained.  I also used a bag of frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry.  Followed the directions after that....This made a nice amount of sauce to place on penne pasta.  My husband loved it!!!!

i did adjust the recipe slightly.  It was amazing!!! I followed what others suggested.  Sauted the spinach in butter, placed RAW chicken covered with sauce and FRESHLY oven baked bacon on top and cook for 25 mins at 350.  Then, add mozz cheese and cook another 10 mins. Delicious!!!

A friend's father passed away so I brought this over to the family and made a pan for us to try as well.  We love bacon but the cheese sauce, as written, I feel over powered any bacon taste at all.  I cooked the chicken in my crockpot during the day to save prep time (I work full time and have a 3 month old and 2 older kids).   All in all, it was good but I'll tweak it next time.

I used real bacon instead of bacon bits, bacon bits are to salty. It is time consuming to make but worth it. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup otherwise it would not be creamy enough. Definately make it again.

I've made this a few times now and it is really versatile as far as how you can put it together.  I usually leave out the mushrooms, use thawed frozen spinach, and real bacon.   Always turns out great no matter how I put it together.  GREAT FLAVORS!! Do not leave out the lemon juice, it really livens everything up and does NOT make it taste lemony at all.

I'll give it one star because my husband liked it.  I took one bite and stopped eating, my daughter ate it cause she was hungry, but it was not delicious as everyone exclaimed!  Will not be making this again ever, and I was so excited about it.

Absolutely wonderful. I took the advice of others and used fresh spinach. Also, did not cook the chicken ahead of time. Just placed it in the casserole and cooked for an extra 20 minutes. We had it the next day, over bowtie pasta! Definitely a keeper!

I didn't give five stars because mine was so darn good and I believe that was due to the fresh spinach used and not pre cooking the chicken. I used a whole bag of fresh baby spinach and stirred it on stove top with fresh minced garlic and 8oz. of baby portabella mushrooms in the melted butter. Just cooked it enough to basically wet the spinach and condense it just a bit. Then put that on the bottom of a 9X13 pan, placed 5 uncooked chicken breast on top, poured the sauce over that and had more parm cheese than stated mixed in that also. I didn't have bacon bits and it was great without them. Everyone in my family said this is a keeper...and it was so easy to make....they did all say it needed more spinach so next time a bag and a half.  I baked at at 350 for about 55-60 min. until chicken temp was at 160.

I agree with other reviewers that this was pretty salty, even for a salt lover like me.  I believe the extremely salty flavor was coming from the bacon bits so, if you have time maybe frying your own bacon would help to reduce the strong salty flavor...?  I chopped my chicken and cooked it in olive oil in the skillet and then followed the recipe as directed.  I served over bow tie pasta as I thought this would be more attractive to my children.  I was right however; they weren't interested in "green stuff" (spinach) in this dish.   Overall, this was pretty good.

This was really delicious, exept for the spinach part. I think i'm going to skip that part next time and just add a vegetable on the side.

My family loved this.  I served with Amish bread and think next time I will serve with pasta or rice, just needed a little more substance as a meal.  The only thing I did differently was cutting up my chicken and cooking it on the stovetop instead of the oven.

We did like it, I liked it more than DH tho, he felt it was bland. I followed the recipe closely, I did use less mozzarella & bacon bits but that's the only difference. I think it was the right call for the mozzarella, but not on the bacon bits - it seemed I used a lot but the taste wasn't as much as I thought it would be. I'll try this on a weekend when I have time to use real bacon, I'm sure that will make a big difference!

This recipe is very DELICIOUS..... this is the first time that i've ever had chicken florentine, and i must say that it is very impressive. I followed someo f the suggestions. I sauteed fresh spinach, garlic, and mushroom in butter, and added a splash of white wine... I put that mixture on the bottom of the baking pan. After I cooked and crumbled the bacon, I browned the chicken in the bacon grease. I cooked it in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes, then i took it out, put on the layer of mozzarella and cooked it until it turned golden brown, another 10 minutes. Very delicious and the boys definitely loved it. I served it over pasta with garlic bread. I will definitely put this recipe into my recipe collection.

i made this for our sunday potluck, and i think it turned out well, though it is a little bit of work.becoz i knew i would not have time to bake everything before service, so did a little precooking the night before. sauteed onions, garlic, spinach and mushrooms, in butter. set aside. next, chopped up chicken into cubes and also cooked/tossed in butter, made the sauce in the morning.layered as recipe says to, topped with bacon and cheese and baked covered for 20 min and uncovered for 20 min. it turned out really very good!!! thanks!

Instead of pre-baking, I cubed the raw chicken and cooked it in the skillet with the sauce, then I poured it into the baking dish.  We ate it with penne. Next time, I'll use a little less Italian seasoning.  Other than that, it was great.  Thanks for sharing!

I modified this slightly: using fresh spinach, no bacon bits, extra mushroom and seasoning the chicken while it was baking (I just can't seem to cook unseasoned meats) and it turned out wonderful.  My non-vegetable-eating husband loved it as well, he claimed dibbs on the leftovers before we even put it away.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

Oh. My. Word.  This is wonderful!  I tweaked it a bit after reading some of the reviews.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with the garlic, butter and mushrooms.  I also cut the chicken into tenders, floured and seared them.  Then layered them in with everything else to finish baking.  I served it over whole wheat linguini and it was to die for!  My three and six year old boys had seconds and would have had more if we hadn't eaten it all!  It's the tastiest way that I have ever eaten spinach!

Awesome!  I will admit that I cheated.  I used a jar of Alfredo sauce instead of using the heavy cream and cheeses.  I also sauted fresh spinach instead of using canned.  Hubby loved it.

My boyfriend loved this recipe, but I only liked it. I did saute the spinach with butter and onions to spread along the bottom of the casserole dish. I also cubed the chicken as others had suggested. I wish the mushrooms would have been more cooked and I would have made more of the white sauce which was absolutely fantastic.

This was a great recipe. I have a picky twelve year old and both her and my husband loved it! I sauted the chicken first in the butter and then slowly added the rest to my large pot. I did add some white wine as well and I served this over pasta. I will make this again.

This is a great creamy and cheesy casserole. What I did differently was put everything but the chicken in the sauté pan, and then just poured the mixture over cooked chicken cubes. I also added some canned artichokes that I halved. I left out the bacon bits as well.  Overall, it was a very tasty and satisfying meal. I would make this again and recommend it to friends/family.

This was good, but I thought the chicken needed a bit more flavor.  Next time, I'll season the chicken breasts with garlic powder, salt and pepper and see if that helps.  Loved the flavor of the sauce.  I served it with Angel Hair pasta.  Tasty.

My wife asked me to make this a second time, it was even better than the first time I added a pinch of pepper and onion salt, those were the only changes.  It is a very easy and good recipe to make, I had the left over for lunch the next day.

Absolutely superb.  My 3 kids (ages 5, 7, & 10) scarfed this down in seconds and wanted more.  My middle child who does not like mushrooms or spinach, was licking his plate and was asking if we could make it for breakfast.  Will add a tad more garlic next time to suit my taste, but otherwise awesome recipe.

So so yummy! I followed the recipe as stated for the most part but i did do what alot of the other reviewers suggested and cooked the chicken with the dish as opposed to cooking it seperately. That seemed like a big time waster and a way to dry out the chicken quite a bit. I did cook the mushrooms before adding them but otherwise just threw it all in the baking dish and waited :)

To make this easier I completed the sauted step, cut up the chicken raw and just mixed everything together in a baking pan and covered with 1/2 cup of moz; then cooked at 350 for 20-25min. I also served it over baked potatoes - YUM!

I really liked this idea - although I did change it quite a bit.  I used half of a chicken that I had roasted earlier in the week (chopped roughly), forgot the lemon juice & used Garlic powder (was out of fresh!).  I used fresh spinach (sauteed) and doubled the amount of mushrooms.  I used FF half and Half and frozen basil.  We did not like the bacon in it and served it over pasta.  I will try it as a Frozen casserole.

As others suggested I sauteed fresh spinach and mushrooms, browned the chicken in the same pan then skipped the first step. I only used about a third of the bacon and half of the cheese at the end and it was awesome. My wife cubed up the left over chicken before storing then added a little chicken broth before reheating for lunch. that worked too with crusty bread

This was not good -- I think it was the canned spinach that made it bad. That metallic, tin-can taste it tends to have -- I wish I'd used fresh spinach.   Still, the remaining ingredients didn't have much flavor or taste. Will not be making this again.

Great recipe. I used turkey cutlets - worked out great! Oh, and subbed 2% evaporated milk for the half & half, and used fresh spinach leaves. Yum.

I love this recipe. I did make a few changes. I cut the chicken up before putting in baking dish and brushed it with olive oil and added seasoning before cooking it. I left out the spinach. I put the cheese before the bacon bits. And I cut the butter amount in half. This was all after I doubled the recipe. Overall, excellent meal and my family loves it.

As is I thought this was way too rich.  I used fresh spinach and fresh bacon but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I would suggest about 1/4 of the butter used.

Made this as written and it was really good, but being my lazy self,the second time I made it with leftover chicken. First cooked chopped bacon in the skillet, then sauteed onion and then cubed chicken in bacon fat, added in the spinach and shrooms to wilt. Stirred in the remaining ingredients and served over hot cooked noodles. I t was really quick and easy and a really delicious way to use up leftover chicken!

The best pasta I have ever made. My wife and child loved it as well. Such a lovely Parmesan cheese taste and was fairly simple to prepare. I didnt bake the chicken I cooked it in a pan while I prepared the other ingredients.

I found the amount of Italian seasoning used to be too overpowering for the other flavors.  Also, you may want to use fresh spinach instead of the canned spinach.  The canned spinach just lacks the good flavor of fresh spinach sauteed in butter or olive oil with garlic and onions.

Holy cow was this scrumpdillyicious!!!!  Easily a restaurant quality meal!  I read many reviews and only made minor tweaks, but not changing the ingredients.  I did the chicken breasts in a skillet and set aside.  I then melted the butter and sauteed the spinach (one bag of fresh spinach, you could use more), mushrooms, garlic and just enough onion to taste.  I didn't have italian seasoning so I improvised and used parsley, basil and oregano.  As suggested, I only used about a teaspoon of the lemon juice.  I served it over spaghetti.  This is a keeper and will be kept in our rotation!

I thought this was just delicious- reminded me of eating in a great restaurant- full of flavor.  I'm a big garlic fan so I minced up about 4 big cloves.  I also added chopped marinated artichokes.  I left out the bacon and didn't feel I was missing anything.  I put it over linguinie so my only regret was that I didn't make more of the delicious sauce, (though it definitely coated at least half a pound and I wouldn't add much more pasta then that anyway as to not take away from the casserole)!! For all vegetarians- if you leave out the chicken and the bacon, it's a great sauce for pasta!  Thank you!!

Wonderful Flavor!  I  took the advice of others and cooked fresh spinich with the mushrooms and then added the uncooked chicken to the top to bake.  A few other minor changes: I used turkey bacon and fat-free half and half to save some calories.  I also added chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the spinich/mushroom mixture.  It was rich and hearty!  The sauce it makes was wonderful on angle hair pasta!

My family really liked this! Followed reciped just as posted but I didn't have any mozzarella on hand, so I subbed Monterey Jack. My husband wouldn't let me freeze the leftovers (I doubled the recipe.) because he wanted to take some for lunch the next day and eat the rest for the following night's dinner! Thank you so much for sharing!

This was really good! Cooked up some real bacon since I didn't have bacon bits. I only used one can of spinach and found that to be enough. I didn't pre-bake the chicken, but I did pound and cut each breast in half (to resemble tenderloins) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it came out cooked perfectly. Served with bow-tie pasta like another review suggested. So yummy! Definitely will make again.

This recipe was okay.  Better the next day.  I used fresh spinach and it was watery the first day.  The second day for leftovers was better.

Great recipe! I changed a few things up based on other reviews and what I had on hand. I skipped step one as suggested by others and cubed the chicken. I didn't have mushrooms on hand so I used artichoke hearts.  Also, I left the bacon out just to cut down on the calories a bit. My family loved it! I will make this again!

This is a great recipe but there are a few things you need to do differently. 1. cut chicken into bite sizes and cook in the bacon grease. 2. I used 1 bag of fresh spinach and cooked it in the bacon and chicken grease with the mushrooms. 3. I used 1 cup mozzarella cheese in sauce and another cup on top ten min. before removing from the oven. I kept the casserole covered and removed it the last ten min. I also used milk instead of the half and half.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used frozen spinach(thawed and drained and fresh lemon juice) I pan fried my chicken in butter with seasonings like garlic and italian seasoning. The only reason I did this is because all I had was chicken tenders and I was pretty confident they would dry out in the oven. The rest I followed as written I did double the sauce MAN it smelled good cooking. I made this in the morning and I think having set all day in the fridge made it even more flavorful!!!

Really good! I did change a one thing though, I sauteed fresh spinach with the garlic and mushrooms instead of adding the garlic in the sauce. But I kept everything else the same and it was perfect. My dad loved it especially.

Wonderful!  I did my sauce a little differently.  I sauted the garlic, butter and mushrooms together, then added my spices and used 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 can of cream of chicken with herbs.  Added the parm. cheese.  Used milk instead of cream. Left out the lemon juice and bacon because I didn't have on hand.  I didn't use as much butter, only about a tbsp.  I wanted to serve the dish  with pasta and have everything in one casserole, so I put a layer of angel hair pasta on the bottom of my casserole dish.  Next I put a layer of sauce. Layer of spinach, cubed chicken seasoned with salt and pepper (I just put mine in raw) and finally the rest of the sauce.  Topped with some grated mozzerella cheese. Baked it in the oven at 375 for 30 -40 minutes.  Turned out delicious!

Very good recipe- definitely will recommend this to friends and family. I also followed other reviews to not cook the chicken before hand but rather place in pan and bake. Also, I used fresh spinach in a bag-next time will use a bag and a half, used portabellas and sauteed with spinach in white wine and garlic. My boyfriend loved, i will be making this again!

This is a very good and quick recipe. The cheeses and spices kind of take out the strong spinach taste therefore it is a good dish for kids too. It is an all around good tasting dish and I highly recommend it.

This is a very tasty recipe!  I also followed tips from other reviews (didn't precook the chicken), and I had to do a bit of improvising with canned organic mushrooms, frozen spinach (thawed and drained) and 6 pepper spice instead of the bacon bits, and it stilled turned out awesome.  I will definitely try this again with fresh spinach and mushrooms, and add the bacon as suggested.  Can't wait!

This was delicious!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the chicken into strips.  I cooked the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter and garlic, then cooked the chicken in a little butter.  Put them in the dish.  Then, I combined all the ingredients for the sauce (with slightly less butter and garlic since I had used up some in previous steps).  The creamy sauce does not need to be added in layers.  Pouring it on top is fine.  It works it's way down while baking.  I did substitute half the half n half for skim milk to cut some calories, and it was still perfect!  Highly recommend this!

I made this for my husband who is on a low carb diet.  We both loved it!  I did modify it somewhat based on what I had on hand at the time.  I cooked onion and garlic, then added the ingredients to make the sauce, used a whole bag of fresh spinach, shredded rotisserie chicken, added some uncooked broccoli and used shredded pepperoni as I didn't have any bacon, combined it all together in a 9x13 casserole dish and sprinkled the top with grated mozzarella cheese and baked.  We loved it!

Ok, even my vegetable-loathing son loved this! He actually ate 2 helpings! That may not mean much to you, but for me, just plain amazing.  I took the advice of others and saute`d the spinach and mushrooms together with just a little garlic and put it on the bottom.  Then I just took some raw chicken tenders and chopped them into bite size pieces and placed them on top of the spinach, then topped with the sauce... Baked at 350 for 20-25 minutes, then topped with mozzarella and bumped up the heat to 400 for another 10 minutes.  I also used a 16 oz. bag of chopped spinach, well drained, instead of the canned because I find canned spinach to be mushy and was afraid it would turn everyone off by its appearance.  Served on top of thin spaghetti seasoned with a little butter, fresh parsley, garlic and pepper... Way easy and Definately a Yum-O dish!

I had a hard time eating this. It looked good, but the canned spinach was not good. My husband didn't even like it and he never complains about anything. I will never make this again, ever.

This turned out perfect the first time.  I used some suggestions from other reviews.  Like I used fresh spinach and salmon instead of chicken.  I put the salmon on the casserole raw and topped it with sauce and cheese and baked for 25 min.  It was excellant!

Seriously good stuff!  Even my 10 year old said, "this is one of those recipes that you can make for company Mom!"  I sauteed the garlic and butter and added 1/2 cp. of onion.  I used frozen spinach, thawed and drained.  I used leftover smoked turkey, but I can't wait to try it with chicken like the recipe states.  I did the sauce 1 1/2 times and put it in a 8X11 pan.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  This is now a recipe for special occassions and not hard at all!!

This is a great one dish meal made with the pasta.  I'd also recommend this for one of those evenings when the extended family is in town, as it could easily be made ahead.  I save my 5 stars for gourmet meals that are beyond compare, and it's not one of those, but it's hearty.  

I made several modifications to this recipe based on previous feedback.  First, I used raw chicken pieces (about four pieces per breast).  Second, I sauteed raw spinach along with the mushrooms in EVOO along with a teaspoon of the garlic.  The recipe calls for canned spinach and I cannot possibly think of any green vegetable packed in a can that has ever tasted good and with as easy as it is to wilt fresh spinach, I didn't consider frozen either.  

I used cooked pasta as my first layer, followed by the spinach/mushroom saute, and then the raw chicken pieces.  I then placed the raw chicken atop the saute and covered the layers with the sauce followed by the Mozz Cheese.  FYI, when including the pasta in the dish, you'll need more sauce, so I doubled the recipe, with the exception of the Italian Seasonings.  
I then cooked the entire dish at 400 for 50 minutes.  PERFECT!!

The chicken was moist and the sauce was perfectly flavored.

I followed the suggestion of another member who put the chicken in raw instead of baking it first.  I ended up cooking it about 45-50 mins at 375.  My husband loved it!  I used heavy cream instead of half-n-half, only b/c that's what I already had.  Also, I served this over bow tie pasta, which was an excellent addition.  Very yummy!

My family really enjoyed this, especially my husband who isn't usually into casseroles. I did take the advice of others and skip the first step. I also used chicken tenders and fresh spinach. Next time I would double the spinach and use a low sodium mushroom soup. The cream sauce was very good and this goes great with a salad and some crusty bread to sop up the sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!!

My husband and I thought this was wonderful ("restaurant quality" is how he put it) but the kids were not impressed.  I may try making it again and leaving out the mushrooms, since they were the source of complaints.  The idea one reviewer had of adding in a layer of potatoes with the spinach/garlic mix sounds very interesting and would make it more of a "casserole".  The sauce is delicious and could be used a number of ways.  Definitely OMIT step 1!

Very yummy. I made a couple of changes.  Left out the bacon bits and mushrooms...only because I didn't have any on hand.  I cooked the chicken in the microwave in water and then cubed it instead of leaving whole.  Also, I used fresh spinach, but I didn't bother to steam it.  I just layered the dry leaves in the bottom of the pan.  It came out great.

This dish had a wonderful flavor but next time I make it I will use fresh or frozen spinach.  The canned spinach wasn't very good.  I served it over egg noodles which I would repeat.

Awesome!  I used an italian blend of shredded cheese for the whole thing. The sauce is soooo godd I'mgoing to try it on a white pizza. Also, I topped the casserole w/ some bread crumbs.  I would suggest that you check it often so that the cheese doesn't become crusty.

This was really good. Lots of flavor and very filling, definitely a keeper! I cubed my chicken sauteed in white wine, butter and garlic, then added fresh mushrooms set aside. In same skillet I sauteed fresh spinach as others suggested with a splash of white wine and garlic, layer bottom of glass dish. In seperate pot mixed half can of soup, lemon juice, half and half, parmesan and italian seasoning together,I let this simmer. Layered chicken mushroom mixture, then sauce topped with fresh bacon bits and mozzorella cheese. Served with steamed brocoli and garlic bread! My boyfriend it was really good and flavorful...will make again.

My husband made this over the weekend and it turned out fantastic.  The cooking times were exact.   Only changes were to substitute 2% milk for half&half and Smartbalance instead of butter. Delicious!  Thank you for a great recipe.

I wanted a recipe w/chicken and spinach, but I don't care for mushrooms. So instead I used sauted diced potatoes with red onion as the bottom layer, then added the sauted spinach w/garlic, then the sauce and chicken. I didn't precook the chicken, instead I baked for 50 mins.  After the first 30 mins, I covered with monteray jack cheese and real bacon. Even my kids loved this one, thanks!

Ok first off, I changed quite a bit. Forgot to say Hubby does not eat chicken so I substituted shrimp in place of chicken and doubled the sauce part of the recipe because I wanted to serve it as sauce over linguini.  Excellent flavor. Relatively easy to prepare. Not terrible expensive and made with ingredients you may already have on hand. I used fresh baby spinach (a pretty good layer of it on the bottom of the casserole dish), topped it with fresh mushrooms then the cooked shrimp. Poured the doubled batch of sauce ingredients over the top. I also added a small minced onion to the sauce ingredients. I used Progresso Mushroom Soup because I find we like the flavor better however it is ready to serve and not condensed like Campbell's so I withheld some of the Half and Half (fat free). I used only half the butter too. I realize that I changed a lot but that seems to be the way I cook, sorry (I hate it when people do that ;). I truly think it would still be great even if I hadn't. Thanks for the great recipe BRYAN0320

This dish is amazing! Based on the numerous review I read, I made it like this: Sauteed the chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic. Once done, I chopped into cubes. The biggest improvisation I had to make was when I discovered I had no cream of mushroom soup! I found the "Cream of Mushroom Soup I" on this site and made 1/5 of it. It came out terrific! Talk about a rush, trying to imitate C of M soup. :) Right before baking, I mixed everything together in one pan, and topped with real bacon bits and more cheese. Served with a wee bit of pasta to go beneath. Next time, I'll just mix cooked pasta right in for that all-in-one-pan convenience. Thanks for the recipe!

This actually turned out better that I was expecting it to. I sauteed spinach and mushrooms with some garlic, little butter and olive oil. I put that on the bottom of the casserole dish with raw chicken on top. I made the sauce almost as written and poured it on top. I used milk instead of half&half and I added about 2 tbsp of chive flavored cream cheese. After baking 30min, I added my own bacon and the cheese for another 10min. It was so yummy!!

This was pretty good. Few changes: I used a bag of spinach and sauteed in white wine then put the raw chicken on top of the spinach and followed the recipe as is except used milk instead of half and half to keep healthier. This turned out great and with the leftovers I added bow tie pasta and made a very tasty pasta dish which I prefer over the casserole. Also, I don't think I will add the bacon next time around.

This was very good.  My daughter swears it was the best chicken she's ever had (she's 20)...  I wouldn't use canned spinach next time... too spinach-y!  With fresh, I'm sure it will be even more delicious

Had to give this 5 stars as it was so good. I did make a few small changes though. It doesn't have to be that fattening either. I first marinated my chicken in the olive oil, garlic and italian seasonings. Chicken is too bland without it. Then, prepared recipe as written except I cut my chicken into strips - easier to marinate - and used less cream, some light milk and chicken stock to keep the sauce creamy. Also used SmartBalance butter and less of it. Fabulous meal and a keeper!

This was good.  I did take the advice and made a few modifications.  I seasoned my chicken w/ salt and pepper before placing it in the oven.  I also sauteed one bag of baby spinach and the garlic in olive oil and about 1 tablespoon of the 1/4 cup of butter.  I drained it before layering it in the baking dish.  Because I love spinach, I think I will use more, because it reduces quite a bit. I also did not have any mushrooms, and it tasted great without it.  I didn't really see the need to add bacon bits, so I didn't.  I first thought 2 cups of cheese would be too much, but it was excellent.  I served the Chicken Florentine with Jasmine rice.  I will definitely make that again

Definitely easy to make, and taste is pretty good too. Just found that the addition of dried herbs were a little much, and following the tips of the other reviewers left the spinach a little too mushy. Will try again without sauteeing the spinach and mushrooms, and some fresh herbs instead. 

Also, my chicken was probably thicker than the recipe called for, and definitely needed much more time.

I give this 4 stars but my husband gave it 5 and even asked for the recipe to make for the guys at the firehouse. I personally did find it a little on the saltier side. That might be eliminated by using real bacon though. 
I did follow the directions, but I used 2 10 oz pkgs frozen spinach instead of canned, I used milk instead of half &half, and for the italian seasoning I used the good seasonings italian blend for salad dressing. All in all it was a good dinner and I will probably make it again. It was also pretty easy to make. I made the sauce while the chicken was cooking and started to arrange the spinach mushrooms( you really could use a 8oz sliced mushrooms and it would be fine) and sauce  in the 9x13. It was great as leftovers for lunch the next day too!

This was so high rated I thought it would be a sure thing. I made it exactly as written so I don't know what I did wrong, if anything. The taste was just odd. Seemed to be the lemon (I used fresh lemon juice) and probably the canned spinach. Fresh spinach might have been better, but I probably won't bother to attempt this again.

This was wonderful. I did make several changes to keep it heart healthy. I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup, reduced fat parm, SPIKE (salt free) seasoning instead of the Italian and low fat sour cream in place of the half and half. I did not use the bacon or the cheese on top. I made mine with the organic frozen spinach I had on hand. Served over whole wheat rotini. My 4 year old and hubby were very happy. Thanks! The sauce was SUPER!!!

I'm sorry, but this was gloppy. It had a bad "mouth feel"...too greasy.   Also, too much Italian seasoning.  I used fresh spinach.

Enjoyed, but thought the bacon bits were too much and the mozzarella cheese was unnecessary.  I also used frozen spinach instead of canned.  Will try again will only half the bacon and no cheese.  :)

Hmm. Poached and cubed the chicken.  Used milk - no reason for fat of half and half.  Used frozen spinach defrosted. Used reduced fat/sodium cream of chicken soup.  Used the italian seasoning.  Served over pasta shells.  Agree with others that the garlic should be cut back - and we love garlic but we're still tasting it as we type this. Flavors were strong and tasty - mostly a matter of personal preference that I won't make this again (hence 3 stars) but a solid casserole dish that many will probably enjoy.

I Loved this!  I'm not a bacon fan so I left that out all together.  I really don't like mushroom either so I instead chopped a red bell pepper and added that.  I used creme of chicken soup instead of creme of mushroom...I also used skim milk and 1 package of spinach.  Instead of using the Italian seasoning I added 1/2 tsp of basil, oregano and thyme...It was GREAT:)

Like the others, I loved this recipe, but with a couple of changes that I did from the suggestions.  I browned the chicken in a skillet with some olive oil and cut it up into bite-sized pieces.  I also layered rotini pasta in the bottom of the casserole dish. The  substitutions I made were Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup, skim milk instead of half and half, fresh baby spinach instead of canned, packaged crumbled bacon instead of bacon bits, and 2% mozzarella cheese.  I also used a whisk when making the sauce in the pan; it makes it much smoother and helps with the pouring.  Everything else I followed according to the recipe.  With these changes, the recipe was fantastic.  The leftovers tasted even better the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good.  I was skeptical about the list of ingredients.  I don't care for mushrooms so subbed cream of chicken soup and omitted the fresh mushrooms.  Also, I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and cooked on the stovetop with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder before adding to the casserole dish.  Even my pickiest eater said it was OK.  Served it over roasted garlic linguini.  My family said this one is a "keeper".

Incredible recipe, you will impress anyone with this, it's really THAT good! I did brown the chicken in olive oil instead of baking.  I used Trader Joe's Organic Spinach (which is the best frozen spinach) and I was going to make rice for a side buy my husband convinced me to put it over pasta and that was the perfect choice!  The pasta picks up the sauce and cheese so well.  We could not stop eating it!

The canned spinach was terrible, but the rest was very good.  Next time I'll either omit the spinach or use fresh and sautee it a little first.

This is an awesome recipe. Very easy to make. I do make a few changes however. I use skinless, boneless chicken breasts and cut them into pieces and then sautee them with the mushrooms and add the sesonings then. I can then use the same pot to make the sauce in. I also use frozen spinach and use the "real" packaged bacon bits on top.  I usually serve it with rice or pasta. I have only received rave reviews!!!

Very disappointing - it tasted very "canned".  Maybe it would be better with fresh spinach, real bacon, etc. but I don't think I'll take a chance on finding out.

Made this tonight and it was very good. Like others, I sauteed the chicken in a pan with some olive oil (and sprinkled some salt and pepper and Italian seasoning on it) instead of baking it. I did make a few additional changes which included putting a little less mozzarella and parmesan, useing healthy request soup, and using skim milk in place of the half and half. I also used chopped prosciutto instead of bacon, since that is what I had on hand, but honestly I think it complements the dish  more than bacon would anyway. I covered the casserole with aluminum foil and removed the foil for the last 5 minutes so the cheese would get some color but so it was still melty and not as much of a "skin." Served it over egg noodles. Hubby asked me to add this to the monthly rotation.

This is truly one of the best dishes I have made from this site. My family loved it!  I took the advice of some of the others and sauteed the chicken in olive oil, garlic, and seasoned salt instead of pre-cooking it in the oven.  Also, my family is not a fan of mushrooms, so I replaced the mushrooms will onions.  I sauteed the onions briefly while I wilted the fresh spinach.  It was perfect!  Lastly, I used fat free half & half to eliminate some of the fat and real bacon instead of bacon bits.  I won't change a thing when I cook this again! Thanks for this wonderful family favorite!

We LOVE this recipe!  I use fresh spinach instead of the canned.  Also, I omit the bacon bits and reduce the mozzarella cheese to one cup.  The chicken turns out wonderfully moist.  This is definitely a new family favorite.

this recipe was great!!  I used a bag of fresh baby spinach for the bottom, sliced portabella mushrooms, and light cream instead of half and half.  I also seasoned the chicken with Cajun Seasoning.  Served it over angel hair.  WHAT A DINNER!!

I loved this recipe!  I also opted to cooking the chicken in a skillet rather than baking it.  I cooked it in butter and Italian Seasoning.  I didn't have bacon, so I substituted bread crumbs instead to give it a bit of a crunch.

cut back on the melted butter because mine pooled on top after it baked but despite that it was really really good.

took some of the previous suggestions to saute fresh baby spinach, mushrooms and some of the garlic with some of the melted butter.  served it over bowtie pasta for valentine's day dinner :)

This dish was so good! I changed a few things though like other people had suggested.  I sauteed the mushrooms and also sauteed the chicken. I doubled the sauce and it was the perfect amount.  The only thing i might change next time is use fresh spinach since the canned had a very distinct taste(different from fresh).

This recipie was amazing! The sauce was great. I doubled the sauce because I just like things saucey! I lightly fried the chicken in olive oil first instead of baking it on a cookie sheet. I also used 1 pck frozen spinach & 1 pck frozen broccolli flowerettes (all I had, but tasted great!)I steamed these before I added everything to the pan, and cooked on 350 for 20 minutes, added the mozzerella and cooked another 10 minutes. Chicken was done & moist. Will definitely be making this again!!!

Made recipe for 2.  Very versitle recipe.  My variation:  Wilted fresh spinach & put in casserole.  Sauteed mushrooms in butter and oil, then covered spinach.  Recipe calls for 2 oz mushrooms.  I used 1 full cup sliced and it was barely enough to cover spinach.  Cut chicken breasts into thirds and browned in flour and butter in skillet.  Did not use bacon.  Rest was as directed.  Still made a great tasting dish!!!

This was very tasty!  Next time I would use fresh spinach.  The canned spinach does not make for good left-overs.  Other than that, this was a great dish!

Fabulous recipe!  Received rave reviews from my family and a friend dining with us.  Modifications I made...Used a little more half-and-half for a thinner sauce and simmered bone-in chicken breasts, then removed from bone and shredded.  Used as a layer between layers of sauce. Also plan to cut down on garlic slightly next time.  Wonderful recipe Bryan0320!  Thanks for sharing.

Delish! I used 2 boxes of frozen spinach,cooked,drained and squeezed dry, cut my chicken into bite sized pieces and sauteed them with a little olive oil and the garlic, used a can of cream of broccoli, and used an Italian 4-cheese blend on the top. Casserole was creamy and so good...loved the flavors and the mushrooms. Will make again soon!

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Next time I will omit the lemon juice because of a personal preferance, but I will definitely make this again.  I felt like a gourmet cook when I brought it to the table!

Oh my goodness!!! This was by far the best recipe that I have found on this site! It should be higher up on the casserole list for everyone to see. I followed the recipe exactly (maybe added a bit more soup and half & half for extra sauce) and made it with a side of spiral pasta.  The flavor was restaurant quality! I wouldn't change a thing! Definitely not a "fat free" recipe but it's worth making when you want to impress... Thanks BRYAN0320!

Fantastic and very easy to prepare. Perfect company dish! Like most, I nixed the bacon. I didn't seem to need all the mozarella -- just about half. Just use your eye to judge. I also used fresh spinach leaves because I had them from a salad two days before, but frozen etc would have made no difference. Make this recipe! Would also be great with the chicken just cut up, and serve it and the sauce over pasta. This is a definite keeper!

A delicious dinner, but almost too rich!  I cut the chicken into strips and sauteed it in some oil instead of prepping it in the oven.  I used frozen spinach instead of canned, and more mushrooms.  I may cut back on the garlic next time. The dish received many compliments from all.

This was quick and easy comfort food.  The sauce was incredible.  I followed other reveiwers advice and cut up and pan fried my chicken with a little EVOO and garlic.  Mixed everything together and put it in a 9x9 dish.  I used fat free cream of mushroom soup, fat free half and half, fresh spinach (I think next time I will chop it up) and reduced fat mozzarella cheese.  I didn't have any bacon, but we didn't miss it.  I was also very short on the amount of Pamesan cheese, so I used about 1/4 cup of 4 italian cheese mix.  Served this over angel hair spag, sprinkled with fresh parmesan cheese!  Thanks, this will get put on the regular menu at our house!

VERY RICH. I read reviews and cut bacon in half and wished I would have tried fresh (chopped) spinach; not just on the bottom-but mixed in the sauce;distributing it through the whole dish. AND I will try half the butter and italian spice next time. I made a 9 x 13 with 8 breast halves and doubled the sauce. I made brown rice (healthier than just white or most noodles) with some wild rice tossed in. Was excellent with spinach and sauce mixed in it.  Will make again with stated changes AND try not pre-cooking chicken. I will cover with foil and just leave off the mozzarella until the last 15 minutes. I think it will be even better with changes.

You must try this dish!  I used frozen spinach instead of canned, omitted the butter, cut back on the cheese and used milk instead of half and half.  I'm sure the full fat version is delicious, but my family had nothing but rave reviews this way, so why?  Serve with "Caesar Salad Supreme."  Very good.

This recipe was just 'ok'.  I made it and froze it ahead of time.  It was REALLY watery and really salty--and I even got out as much liquid from the spinach as I could before I layered everything.  It was decent, but not my favorite.

Instead of the condensed mushroom soup, I used about a cup of Trader Joe's Portabello Mushroom soup with this and only a 1/4 cup of half and half. Served it at a MOMS club luncheon and everyone loved it. Served it with brown jasmine rice. Excellent dish!

Very good and very rich. I used breasts with rib meat and browned in butter/olive oil then baked them 25 minutes. I also used fresh spinach wilted in olive oil and lemon juice. Very good.

Just made it 10 minutes ago. I took the suggestions and used fresh spinach and sautéed it. Cooked the chicken in the bacon grease and cut it bite size and combined with the sauce and it is amazing. My husband can’t get enough of it. Thinking about a way to put it in sandwich form!!! Loved it !!

Enjoyed this, but made a few alterations.  Not a big fan of mushrooms, so avoided adding the mushrooms and decided the creme of mushroom soup was enough.  Also, used one can of spinach instead of two, and thought that was plenty.  Still tasted delightful.

I never try new recipes for hosting dinner, but took a chance and so glad I did! I did take suggestion of other reviewers and sautéed spinach with garlic first and cooked mushrooms in butter, then baked the chicken in the over without pre-cooking. It is restaurant quality good!

This recipe is easily streamlined and based on a few other reviews, I did the following:  Cut raw chicken breasts into 1" cubes. In a twelve" skillet sauteed real bacon until crisp, then removed and set aside,  keeping about 1 tbsp of bacon grease in skillet.  Added 1 drained 4 oz can of mushroom stems and pieces to skillet, along with 1 bag of fresh baby spinach, sauteed until spinach has wilted. poured that into baking dish, (I never, ever buy canned spinach).  In same skillet, made sauce almost as directed. I personally thought it was too thick so added half to 3/4 soup can of water to sauce and whisked together. Poured half that over spinach, then topped with raw chicken cubes, rest of sauce and then topped that with crumbled bacon. I did not use the mozzarella cheese (I didn't have any) and am glad I didn't.  I agree with another reviewer who said the sauce was very rich  even though I thinned it and left off the mozzarella, it was still rich, but good.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes, and served over linguini.

Good flavor but way too soupy. Followed recipe but used fresh baby spinach and 2 chicken breasts cut into strips. There was just too much sauce.  Might make again with less sauce or increase spinach and mushrooms.  I love all the ingredients in this recipe and was eager to make with all the rave reviews but was very disappointed with outcome.

Don't hesitate to try this! This was one of the best meals I've gotten from Allrecipes over the years. We loved it! I followed the advice from the very first review and sautéed a bag of fresh spinach with a little butter, garlic and mushrooms. Put that in the bottom of my casserole dish, placed the raw chicken on top and topped with the sauce and baked. Took out for the last 10 minutes and topped with mozzarella cheese. I had to bake mine longer than stated, but my oven temp is off on the low side. Kept baking until thermometer read 165 degrees and the chicken was moist and tender! If you use fresh spinach, I would recommend doubling the amount bc after sautéing it wilts down to almost nothing.

Definitely will make this again. I did add three small changes. I used fresh baby spinach and mushrooms. Chopped the spinach and sautéed in a little oil. Placed in the dish, then sautéed the mushrooms in the same skillet. 
I also pan seared the chicken rather than in the oven before hand. 
The sauce is absolutely delicious and simple.  The fresh lemon gives it a nice light(er) kick. The chicken came out very tender. First night served on pasta, second night on white rice. Both were very good.

I loved this chicken dish! I followed the suggestions of another reviewer. I used fresh spinach which I sauteed in butter along with the mushrooms and garlic. I did not pre-cook the chicken breasts  just placed atop the spinach mixture and baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. I then topped it with the bacon and the cheese and baked it for about 7-8 minutes. Absolutely delicious!

Yum!  Did not need to precook the chicken!  Placed it in the casserole and baked covered on 350 for 25 min, then added cheese and baked for 15 more, still covered at 350.  Chicken was SO juicy and tender and helped make it saucy enough to serve over pasta.  Will be adding to our meal rotation!

I will make this many more times!  I sauted mushrooms separately and at the end added fresh spinach until wilted.  I cooked bacon and then browned the chicken a bit in the bacon grease.  I then made the sauce in the same pan the mushrooms and spinach cooked in.  Served with rice.... So yummy!!!

This was delicious, but I found it a little too salty to give it 5 stars. I did make some changes as suggested by another user: fried 4 pcs of bacon then cooked the (cubed) chicken and garlic in the bacon grease. Removed that then cooked a bag of fresh baby spinach and mushrooms in same pan. I used 1/4 cup 2% milk and 1/4 cup half & half. I put one cup of the mozz in the sauce. I mixed half the chicken in the sauce and put the other half on top of the spinach/mushroom mixture. Baked at 350 for 30 min in covered casserole dish. Uncovered and sprinkled remaining cheese on top and cooked additional 10 minutes. Served over thin spaghetti.

I would make this again with a few tweaks as other users have suggested. While I love rich dishes, this dish was overly rich. Next time I may sub milk for the half and half and use slightly less cheese and bacon. I also did not pre-cook my chicken but put the raw chicken in the casserole dish with the sauce on top of the veggies and cooked at 350 for 20 minutes. I then topped with the remaining cheese and bacon and finished it at 400 for 15 minutes. Definitely good if you're looking for a rich and decadent dish!

This dish is wonderful!   I used fresh spinach and fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I halved the recipe as written but I really like fresh spinach and put in 4 handfuls.  My husband who swears he hates spinach loved this dish.  When I make it again...and I will make it again, I'll add thinly sliced red onion on top of the mushrooms.  Super easy dish to make. It looks just as wonderful as it tastes.

This is very rich, but very tasty.  I used chicken thighs and baked everything (which made it much easier).  I chopped and fried the bacon first, quickly sauteed the veggies and added it all to a baking dish.  Will make again.

I doubled the sauce since we like a lot on pasta.
I'd cut the chicken next time so you don't need a knife to eat it. I'd 1/2 the garlic, found it overwhelming.
I did as others suggested and boiled chicken first.  Sauted mushrooms and spinach with white part of green onion.  
baked at 350 for 25 min and added fresh sliced mozzarella cooked additional 10 mins.  It was so good!!

SOOOOO Delicious!!  The only changes that I made were to not cook the chicken, and to saute the mushrooms and spinach.  This is by far one of the best meals I have ever made!  We will be making this again soon!

We really loved this casserole.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and skipped precooking the chicken to make this faster.  I didn't have bacon bits, so I fried up a couple of pieces of bacon and then diced them.  I only had fresh spinach (used the majority of a bag) and canned mushrooms on hand, so I sauted those both up in a little of  bacon grease and then put on the bottom of the dish.  Then I layered the raw chicken, sauce and bacon.  I left the cheese off until the last 10 minutes of cooking.  In the sauce, I cut the butter down to 1/8 cup and used 1/2 c skim milk to cut the calories a bit, but it was still plenty rich.  Another reviewed recommended cooking for 30 minutes at 350 and then adding cheese and cooking an additional 10 minutes, but our chicken was raw yet, so my husband put it in for another 30 minutes, but I think that was a little long.  I'm thinking about 50 minutes probably would have been ideal, but just check your chicken to make sure it is fully cooked.  The flavor was excellent over pasta.  I will definitely make again.

I made this for company and put it together during the day and cooked it later.  I cooked bacon (not a fan of prepared bacon bits) and drained the grease.  I added a little oil and browned 1 side of the breasts then cooked the mushrooms and garlic in a little butter and then added a package of fresh spinach and wilted it.  I made the sauce and took the advice of someone else and added about a cup of cheese to the sauce.  Added the spinach, mushrooms and garlic to a casserole dish, topped with some sauce, added the breasts and poured the remainder of the sauce on top, then bacon pieces, and topped with about 1/2 cup cheese.  This was a big hit with everyone!

I made this for the first time last night. I cut up the chicken, sauteed the spinach and mushrooms, laid it all nice and neat and cooked for 25 minutes at 350.  It looked beautiful.  It tasted... Meh.  I thought it needed salt, also, not really enough sauce to eat over noodles... yet too much sauce to eat on its own with a side dish. Mushy spinach.

I replaced the half & half with light sour cream. I used fresh spinach and doubled the mushrooms. Following advice from other reviewers, I sauted the mushrooms and spinach in the butter with the garlic. I didn't precook the chicken but did cut it into strips. I forgot to add the Italian seasoning but didn't miss it.   Same with the lemon juice. Rice is a good side for this dish.

This was great!  I did what a couple others suggested and sauteed the mushrooms and spinach (I used more spinach than was called for).  I also added onion and extra garlic.  I placed raw chicken on the bed of mushroom sautee mix.  I added a little more half and half.  Next time I will use more spinach and try it out with shrimp.  Great recipe to adjust to suit your taste!

I made this for supper and I will definitely make it again!  I cut the recipe in half and followed the suggestion from VICSGARDEN.  I too thought cooking the chicken first didn't make sense.  I used a whole bag of fresh spinach and sauted it with the mushrooms.  I also served it over linguine.  Certainly not necessary but sure was good.  Great recipe.

Made this for the family we doubled the recipe, we even had left overs (10 adults, 2 kiddos) I used fresh spinach and canned mushrooms. It was a HIT, already thinking of ways to improve and add to it. This was also a very "kid" friendly dinner. My cousins 3 year old loved the "chicken Part"

Used fresh cooked bacon and was very glad I did. Didn't like it much until I put it on top of angel hair spaghetti, then it was pretty good.

It was good, but could use some changes for my taste buds. My fiance loved it. We followed the recipe minus the fresh mushrooms, as I don't like them. The dish itself was very rich, so I had a hard time finishing it. Made noodles on the side which I will not do again - it wasn't a good combination. Think next time we make it, I will use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, less spinach, and serve it with garlic bread. Overall, a good recipe that we'll use again with a few changes!

I'm more of a "beef" man myself, however, this was "off the hook"!! The sauce was a bit thick so I invoked a little southern ingenuity...I added some beer...extra mushrooms and fresh spinach!

We used fresh spinach and fried a few strips of bacon instead of using ready made bits. Poured it all into a 9x13. It was delicious.

It was tasty but very rich.  Needs to be toned down and maybe lemon added to lighten it up. Probaby won't make again, at least as-is.

I work late occasionally and decided to throw everything in the crockpot this morning, but I only had fresh spinach and real bacon.  I'm very pleased with how it turned out! :)

Our family didn't enjoy this meal. I even did as the others suggested and sautéd the spinich and mushrooms and put that on the bottom of the dish, also I cooked my chicken breasts in the crock pot, so they were super tender and then come dinner time I just had to do the remaining steps. Almost towards the end of the oven cooking, I broiled it for a few minutes so it made a nice crust on the top (not too much! Just enough to add a little texture) and even with those few added elements, it just wasn't a winner for us.

I just made this dish and I loved it. Didn't try the bacon bits but I didn't think they were necessary. Instead of pasta I made rice and served it over that. This dish is full of flavor and I will be making it again.

Most excellent flavor, we all loved it, even the cats! Not that there were a lot of leftovers for them but we did scrape the plates! The kids want to try it again next week with shrimp for their night in the kitchen. Delicious!

This was quite good.  I made a few changes according to some of the other reviews.  Fresh spinach,  several slices of bacon, and cuting the chicken into chunks sauteing them in some bacon fat all worked for me.  I used fresh grated pamigiana cheese too.  With a splash of white wine this would make a nice company dish served on thin spaghetti.  My husband doesn't care at all for spinach, but he said the dish was real good and he didn't realize spinach was even in it (I don't know what he thought that green stuff was?)  It wasn't the ultimate recipe, but I will make it again one day.

It was Awesome & Easy!  I did use bag of Fresh Baby Spinach instead. Sautéed it in 2tbsp Margarine & Little Olive Oil   Added a little white wine (Pinot Grigio) to Cream Sauce to lighten it up. I opted to cook fresh bacon to top off the dish. It's definitely a Keeper in my Recipe Box !

I pr-cooked chicken in oven with butter but a little dry.  I would sauteed in pan in butter and olive oil next time.  I sauteed 1/2 chopped onion and mushrooms and butter, olive oil and Italian seasoning added minced garlic and squeezed half a fresh lemon over it.  Then I added the cream and soup to that mixture and grated Parmesan cheese but just a 1/4 cup  I used fresh spinach and parboiled it to make enough for 2 cups. I layered spinach, then half cream sauce chopped chicken into bite size pieces layered them and then covered with the remaining cream sauce and grated mozzarella on top.  Baked at 375 degrees for 1/2 hour till bubbly.

This is a good recipe my husband enjoys it. I do as other reviewers suggest and I skip the first part and I sautéed the mushroom and garlic in some butter and then sautéed fresh baby spinach until wilted. I have used frozen and thawed spinach as well before and it works too. I layer mushrooms and spinach on bottom, put raw chicken on top and pour prepared sauce on everything and top with bacon. Bake for 20 minutes at 350 then top with mozzarella and bake for 10 more minutes but I have add mozzarella before baking before and baked 30 and it turned out good. There is a lot of sauce and the water from the chicken can make it kinda runny so I think it would be good to use the sauce like a gravy for mash potatoes.

I first made this recipe exactly as written, and it was good. I did notice, however, that in layering the spinach and mushrooms in the pan, I would get random huge bites of spinach, and then none in other bites.  I would have given the dish 3 stars then.  After reading reviews from others, it's not the ingredients I changed (aside from milk instead of half and half), but rather the way I put it together.  Everything up to step three I follow- then I simply add my spinach, bacon, and mushrooms to the sauce itself, stir it all together- place the chicken in my pan (do not brown it first, waste of time) and pour the sauce to coat.  Pop it in the oven for about 25 minutes and it comes out perfect!  Letting it set after pulling it out of the oven thickens the sauce a bit, and it's simply DELICIOUS.  I've made this recipe time and time again and it's one of my favorites on allrecipes!

Loved this!  We had it for dinner tonight. My boyfriend thought it was the best chicken he ever had. I followed the recipe following instructions for 3. Mainly because I had 3 chicken breasts. I loved partially baking chicken first.  That way none of the drippings were in the casserole.  My chicken was moist and cut with a fork. I cooked bacon and made fresh crumbles. The flavor is awesome. Would have been good served over fettuccine pasta too.

I like it a lot, although like most other reviewers, I felt that the recipe itself was a start that could benefit from a lot of tweaking.  So forgive me for giving a review for a recipe that I modified heavily, without at least trying it as written the first time.  I usually don't do this.  My only addition to the many very worthwhile comments would be: 1. spend 5 more minutes to make a quick white sauce, then add your own mushrooms, using at least 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms (you can even add a touch of sherry); 2. use fresh or frozen spinach instead of canned.  We buy large bags of fresh spinach that we can never finish, so I freeze it and always have some available for cooking; 3. if you are concerned about saturated fat, you can substitute canned milk for the half and half without even noticing the difference--the other strong flavors will dominate, and the texture is controlled by the thickness of the rest of the sauce.  Try it once before you dismiss it.

This was super delicious! I sauteed fresh baby spinach with garlic instead of using frozen spinach but good to know that frozen works in a pinch. I also skipped the first step and just baked this dish with the uncooked chicken for about 25-30 mins. Comes out great!

I think it was a very good dish. Of course I made modifications of my own. I made my own mushroom soup, I used fresh bacon and I added some tomato pieces to cut down the rich creamy sauce and finaly used frozen spinach instead of canned. I will be cooking this dish again.

I skipped the step of pre-baking the chicken and instead pan sauteed the chicken to get it lighly browned. I also mixed some mozzarella cheese into the sauce and added it on top. I used real bacon instead of fake bacon bits. Overall it turned out good, but a little salty. Next time I will use frozen spinach instead of canned, and decrease the amount of cheese and bacon to cut out some of the salt. Overall, a yummy, simple weeknight dinner.

I used the recipe right up to where it says canned spinach, I just couldnt do it. I used a bag of fresh spinach which I sauteed with the fresh mushrooms and garlic in a drizzle of olive oil. I put that in the bottom of the casserole dish and then followed the rest of the recipe. I found that 2C of mozzerella was too much for us, so I used 1C. I also used about 2 Tbsp white wine in place of the lemon juice. I added 1 Tbsp granulated garlic to the sauce along with the italian seasoning.I cut up some cooked leftover chicken breast and served everything over fettucini noodles. We loved it. Thanks for the great idea.

It was amazing! I read some reviews before making it. I also used frozen spinach, which made it kinda soupy.. but still great. I fried the bacon and sauteed the mushrooms in the bacon grease, then put that on top of the spinach in a 9x13 pan, then cooked the chicken partially and put half the sauce on the spinach and then added the chicken and put the rest of the sauce on the chicken, topped it with the bacon pieces and the mozzarella cheese. Covered and baked at 350 for 20 mins, then uncovered and baked for another ten mins. I couldn't get the cheese to brown because of the water from the spinach but it would have been great over rice. I had two helpings... couldn't stop eating it!

Delicious! I cube the raw chicken and cook it in olive oil on the stove, then add all of the other ingredients. Pouring it over linguini noodles when finished! Yum!

The only thing I changed was that I used a fresh bunch of spinach instead of the canned stuff.  Everyone loved it.

Rich and satisfying!  Very easy to prepare.  I cut down on the bacon topping, as we find it a bit overwhelming.  (I also use turkey bacon.)  I use a huge amount of fresh spinach, and it cooks down beautifully.  I serve with angel hair pasta.  Freezes well.  It's a big hit with my husband and young son.

Great recipe...used fresh spinach instead of canned.  It is a little rich, will cut butter next time and use milk instead of half and half.

LOVED this recipe!!!!! My kids loved it as well!!!! I cooked my chicken breasts and then sliced them and layered them over the top of spinach before baking, that way the younger ones could eat as much as they wanted without having to not eat a whole breast. Definitely making this again!!!!

Made this with left over roasted chicken.  Great for leftover chicken.  I used fresh spinach and baby bella mushrooms.  I made a bed of spinach and mushrooms and topped with cut up chicken and poured the sauce over the top.  Bake 25mins at 400.  I served over egg noodles.

This was excellent. I used fresh spinach instead of canned. I sauteed it with the mushrooms before adding it to the casserole dish. I didn't cook my chicken first, I just added it raw. I pounded it thin and left the cooking time the same. I then added the cheeseand baked another 5 mintues till the cheese was melted. Awesome!! Will make again!!

May I first say that I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand.  I used cream of chicken.  It still turned out ok, but I think the cream of mushroom would be a better fit.  Also, the Tablespoon of italian seasoning may be a tad too much.  Next time, I will try it with 1/2 a Tablespoon.  Great recipe and my kids gobbled it up!

This was okay. I used leftover rotisserie chicken for it and fresh spinach and followed the recipe as is. I think an alfredo sauce--homemade--would taste better than the cream of mushroom soup, but the soup is a quicker ingredient.

I made this with shrimp and used portabello mushrroms.  I was disappointed, yet, if it was chicken and regular mushrooms, maybe served over linguine would probably be good.  Would not recommend with portabello's or seafood. Use it as a chicken recipe and you will be pleased!

Yummy.  Next time I will use less spinach and increase the sauce.  Let it set for about 15 minutes after baking because the sauce is a little water-y.

This dish was good, but not something I'm dying to make again. I think the best part was the sauce - I might make that and incorporate it into a new dish.

Even though I have not made this dish for a while, it has become one of my favorites. The first few time I actually measured each ingredient, now I just eyeball it. You must make it with all the recommendations of the other viewers. That is what I did and it was absolutely tasty!
You do not need to bake the chicken separately. What I did was: 
I sautéed some garlic and cooked my mushrooms and red peppers, and wilted my spinach in that mixture so it would get the flavor of the garlic. I arranged that in a casserole tray. I then sautéed some onions, more garlic and cooked the chicken. I left the chicken in the pot and made the sauce: with the herbs, soup, lemon juice, parmesan cheese, 2% milk, and salt and pepper.
 I then poured the sauce on top of the spinach mixture and let it cook in the oven for 15 minutes. I then added some mozzarella cheese and baked some more and served with white fluffy rice. YUM

This was great, although my version was loosely similar to this one by the time I got done.  Having to just use what I had, I used green beans instead of spinach, 8 chicken breasts that I boiled and cubed, 3/4 tsp of garlic powder in place of garlic, a can of sausage gravy in place of the cream of mushroom soup, pizza seasoning instead of Italian seasoning, and milk and a dollop of sour cream in place of half-and-half.  It still worked out and was really good, so obviously, the recipe is fairly flexible!

This was awesome!  and I'm not a big fan of recipes with cream soup.  I just did a few things differently so I'm really not altering the recipe just the method.  I placed fresh spinach in a 9x12 pan, arranged chicken tenders on top, mixed the sauce together as directed and poured over the chicken and spinach.  Last 5 mins topped with Mexican cheese because that's what I had on hand.  Didn't add bacon or mushrooms but most likely would make a great addition.  Easy method - just layer it in a casserole and bake at 400 for about 40/45 mins.

Made this tonight and it was very good. I did use milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and left off the bacon, I will probably use less garlic and spices as others have suggested next time. Definitely a keeper though.

The chicken was overcooked and dry. The sauce had a good flavor and added some moisture. The biggest problem was the canned spinach. I should have known better since I always use fresh or frozen. I guess I thought some magic would happen with the sauce to make it taste better. Two cans of clumpy, soggy greens that smell like dirt underneath the chicken. Awful. Maybe some people like canned spinach but not this family! Even so, better spinach would not be enough to save this recipe.

This tasted pretty good. I was a bit put off by the canned spinach. I had never used it before and it wasn't a pretty sight. I had a hard time getting over the way it looked and smelled. My husband and three year old liked it, but the spinach ruined it for me.

The whole family enjoyed this dish!

I skipped the mushrooms (and substituted cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom), skipped the first step, and used fresh spinach instead of canned.
It was yummy!

I made this with similar variations to the other reviews (don't pre-cook the chicken, use fresh spinach), and it was excellent!  It didn't taste exactly like every other cream-of-mushroom-soup-based casserole, which was awesome.

Very good!  It will definitely go into our rotation of family meals.  The reviews were very helpful.  I, too, prepared it without doing the first step of baking the chicken alone.  It was really tender and juicy.

This recipe is very good, but I didn't bake the whole chicken breasts, but instead braised them in water, and chopped them before adding to the casserole.  I also used fresh spinach instead of canned.  Very tasty!

Would give five stars but only with some modifications such as skipping the first step with the chicken and just bake it from the raw form. Also I used portebello mushrooms. Very good!

I didn't change a thing with this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious!  The spinach was really creamy and the chicken moist.  I will definitely use the sauce on pasta in the future.  Supurb!

I followed the changes on ALLY99's review and this was DELICIOUS!!!! My whole family loved it! I did use canned spinach though-but only 1 can and it was plenty. I rinsed it and squeezed out all the excess water in a kitchen towel. I was nervous because in the pan it looked very greasy, but it once it was spooned over the pasta it looked beautiful. Will definitely make again!

This is amazing!! The only change I made is I cut the chicken up and spread it all over the spinach and mushrooms, and I sauteed the mushrooms in butter, garlic, and white wine.  This dish tasted like something from an Italian Restaurant.  It was fantastic!!!!!

This was pretty darn good. I did make egg noodles to go along with it so I wish I would've made more sauce. Next time I will also mix the spinach in with the sauce instead of laying it on the bottom of the dish.

Very good, the only difference I had was that I bake the chicken in a pan with a lid to keep it moist and cut it up and add it to the sauce.  I also use 16 oz frozen spinach thawed, drained and squeezed instead of canned and I leave the bacon bits off.  I haven't been to a get together yet where I wasn't asked for the recipe.

This is one of my husband's favorites, even though I find it very "heavy".  I usually use jarred bacon pieces to make it even easier.  I also use fresh spinach.

This was a very good recipe although I used fresh spinach like others.. I made it over pasta the first time and decided to try a different spin on it the next time by using a cheese soup(such as broccoli cheese) instead of cream of mushroom soup.  I cooked some potatoes and put it on those and my family loved it!

This meal is one I will definitely make again. I did follow some of the other viewer's suggestions by skipping the first step and sauteeing the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter, and then placing in the bottom of the casserole dish, then I mixed the ingredients for the cream sauce in a sauce pan, and then followed the rest of the recipe. My daughter said "this was a very good dinner", and I smiled. Thank you for such a good recipe. This is going in my recipe box and will be made dozens of times.

Delicious.  Fresh mushrooms and frozen spinach instead of canned make this taste restaurant quality.  Also, i sauteed chicken tenders and cut them into bite size pieces instead.  I served this over bow tie pasta.  My whole family loved it.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe (and it's a good way to get the kids to eat Spinach...). I followed the recipie (I put foil over the chicken when I baked it to keep it moist, then re-used the same pan and chicken juices when it was time to bake). This is a new favorite!!

4 stars only because I made a few changes to it.  This was soooo good though!  My changes were that I used skim milk instead of half & half and only used 1/4 cup.  Spinach has so much moisture anyway the sauce really didn't need that much milk.  I doubled the spinach (we LOVE spinach) and sauteed it with minced garlic and onions.  I also added parm cheese and red pepper flakes to the spinach mixture.  I also sauteed the chicken for 2 minutes on each side before adding it to the baking dish w/the spinach.  After the mozzerella melted I topped it with italian bread crumbs and broiled it until they were toasted.  I served it with pasta but it didn't need it!  It was AMAZING all by itself!

My husband and I made this recipe on Sunday for my family and everyone loved it. BUT we followed the directions and the casserole had a very watery consistency, not creamy at all! What should I do differently next time to ensure this dish turn out creamy and delicious?

I thought the flavors didn't work together in the end.  The bacon bits were too much ... maybe if I had reduced the amount of bacon bits, or used a higher quality bit, but in the end not so good.

Gluten free folks, this is an excellent recipe and easily modified for your diet needs. I used Progresso cream of mushroom soup, which is now gluten free and it is an excellent meal for all members of the family. Enjoy!

This was delicious and easy to make - most of my attempts at cooking end up in the dog's dishes. But this was easy and tasty. I added roasted red peppers and served it over rice pilaf. It is a little heavy, so I used milk instead of half and half and low fat cream of mushroom soup. I also eliminated the bacon bits and it didn't seem like it was missing anything.

I followed the advice of the top reviewers and it was nice! Even my family members that claim to hate stuff like mushrooms and spinach ate it and were surprised they liked it.

My family LOVED this!  Has a wonderfully rich flavor and is so easy to throw together!  I used chicken tenders, since that's what I had on hand, and seasoned with a bit of Italian seasoning before baking.  I couldn't see using canned spinach.  I used fresh baby spinach.  FANTASTIC over whole wheat farfalle pasta.  I'll work this recipe into the regular rotation!  Thanks BRYAN!

This was good, but we thought it was way too much spinach for the dish. (And we love spinach) Next time I would use only one can or use fresh spinach. The sauce was great though.

I followed most reviewers suggestions and sauteed the mushrooms and spinach,place the uncooked chicken on top of that, then continued the recipe as stated.I did grate parmesan on top of the melted mozzarella after removing from the oven.This dish was okay......did'nt knock my socks off though. 3 Stars

Made this last night.  It was just ok.  1 T. of italian seasoning is way too much!  It was overwhelming.  2/3 C of bacon bits was too much too.  It made the dish too salty.  Next time I'd use a 1/2 tsp. of italian seasoning and just a scant sprinkling of bacon bits.  I'd also try using a little less butter in the sauce.  I put the uncooked chicken on the sauteed fresh spinach and cooked it, and it was very, very soupy, so I'd opt for stewing the chicken first, cutting it up and placing it on the spinach mixture. 1 C of mozzarella is enough.  2C would have been too much.

Just LOVE this recipe!! I also sauted the chicken on the stove using EVOO and smoked garlic. I use fresh spinach, I also add a little extra garlic and garlic salt to the sauce. (we love garlic!) And I find using tenderloins is easier, and that way we don't have to worry about serving a whole breast half to one person. Aside from that, this recipe is widely LOVED by everyone that I have cooked it for! I can't wait to make it for my Italian Mom! ;)

Pretty good as written, only a major flaw with the italian seasoning. Thank goodness I didn't put in a whole tbsp as directed; it was overpowering with little more than half that. Best served over linguine.

I am giving 4 stars because I didn't make the recipe as written since I don't eat mushrooms. I am giving 4 stars for the method. This tasted very good with cream of celery soup and no mushrooms so I'm sure the recipe is good as written for you mushroom fans :)

This recipe was fantastic.  I made the following  changes.  I cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces (they were pretty large and thick), coated them with a mixture of Panko and Italian breadcrumbs and browned them in a mixture of butter and olive oil (about 1 T each) for 2-3 minutes per side instead of cooking the whole breasts in the oven.  For the sauce mixture I started out with some diced onion and sauteed that for a few minutes prior to adding the garlic and the rest of the ingredients.  I used a bag of fresh baby spinach in place of the canned spinach (will use more fresh spinach next time).  Topped it with a mixture of mozzarella and provolone cheese that I had on hand - along with some peppered bacon (diced) that I also had in the refrigerator.  This is definitely company worthy!  My husband thoroughly enjoyed it and we are looking forward to having the leftovers.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!!

This is pretty bland. Please do not waste your time and money on this. The chicken by itself is very bland. the sauce has some good flavor which comes only from the soup you add into it. I am Indian and so we make some really tasty food with lots of flavor so this was bland for me adn my husband. Two stars only because it was edible.

I really liked this recipe. My husband thought it was great! I did vary this up a bit, using most of the same ingredients, but in different amounts & prepared differently based on previous reviews. Things like less canned spinach, Italian seasoning, butter, lemon juice & mozzarella; sauteing the mushrooms & and chicken in a skillet; &  adding uncooked instant rice on top of the spinach layer to help with the "too liquidy" complaint while making this mor of an actual casserole. I also added a drained can of quartered artichoke hearts before pouring on the sauce & left out the bacon. The finished dish was very good with the changes, but I would do a few things differently next time to make it even better. First, I cut the chicken into 1" pieces, again to make this more of a casserole, but sauteing & then baking left them overcooked. Next time I will not pre-cook the chicken. Also, even though I basically doubled most of the other ingredients since I had more chicken & wanted to use a 9"x13" pan, I only used 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning & thought that was still too much. I will use a 1/2 tbsp next time. I also sprinkled some seasoned salt & pepper over the spinach layer since canned spinach is bland & there is no salt or pepper called for in the recipe. I will also increase the rice amount to 1 1/2 cups (up from 1 cup). The end result was delicious & something I am looking forward to making again. Thanks!

Overall good recipe. Took a few suggestions from prior ratings; browned bacon in pan; pan seared chicken in bacon drippings; cooked spinach in pan drippings. Definately will make again.

So great, made the dish with little adjustments...no bacon, used whole milk instead of  1/2 and 1/2, fresh spinach, and browned the chicken prior to baking. Prepped the spinach and mushrooms and chicken night before. Day to sere made sauce and cooked for about 30 minutes and topped with Italian blend cheese....YUMMY GOODNES...extra sauce (used 2 cans of soup) will be used to put on pasta for another dinner!!

This was good, but not amazing.  Way too much spinach - 1 can would be more than plenty (and fresh spinach would be the best!).  I left out the bacon since I don't eat it and this was pretty bland overall.  I didn't feel that it was too rich as others stated or too salty for that matter.  Definitely missing something...so I'll play with the leftover sauce this week and see what I can do to spruce it up and make it 5 star worthy

I fell in love with this dish the first time I made it. I think it tastes like a meal from a fancy italian restaurant. I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I actually omitted the bacon (I think anything with bacon just makes the whole thing taste like bacon) and I don't think it was missing anything. I highly recommend cutting up your cooked chicken breasts and putting it in with the sauce instead of serving whole chicken breasts. It is a great recipe!!!

one of my new favorite dishes.  like other reviewers said, it really is an easy but elegant dish.  i saw that other reviewers used fresh spinach, but i try to follow ingredients as listed, so i used a canned spinach that was already seasoned... yummm.  the only advice i took from others was to skip step 1 and bake everything at once for 30-35 min at 350 degrees.

My husband grilled chicken the night before that had been marinated in an altered version of a beef/chicken marinade from allrecipes.com and I diced up the leftover chicken to use for this recipe. I hate mushrooms, so I substituted sun-dried tomatoes which was amazing!!! I used fresh spinach and added the chicken to the sauce as suggested by others.  This has been our favorite dish from allrecipes so far.  Will definitely cook again and again and again!!

Really good! I didn't have any mozerella, so I substituded light cream cheese for the parmesean in the recipe, and subsituted parmesean for the mozerella. I also added chopped up artichokes on top of the chicken. It was delicious!

Delicious!!! I would recommend some kind of pasta to go with this meal.  It was great, I used real bacon bits and frozen spinach.

this is a good recipe, except the 2/3 cup of bacon bits is way too much! I would make it again, completely omitting the bacon bits!

Awesome, follow first reviewers instructions but instead of bacon like everybody uses go get some proscuitto.  Don't have to cut it or cook it first and it has a ridiculous flavor that is perfect for this dish

I also made some of the changes made by previous reviewers.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so skipped the garlic and used garlic cream of mushroom soup. I used one box of fresh spinach and sauteed it.  I also sauteed the mushrooms then cut up the chicken in large chunks and seared it then put on top of the spinach and mushrooms, poured the sauce over everything and baked at 350 for 15 min.  Added 1 cup of shreddes cheddar cheese and bacon and baked for an additional 30 min.........MMMMMMMMMMMMM Delicious!!!!!!!!

Really loved this meal.  However mine was VERY salty and I didn't add any salt.  Next time I'll use low sodium cream of mushroom and salt free butter.  The taste on this recipe was really great!

This is a good recipe, not great, good. I will put it into my rotation though. It just seemed like it was missing something, it didn't wow me. My bf like it though so that of course will get it a pass! I took others suggestions and browned the chicken on my stovetop first and the rest of the recipe i stuck to.

Like other reviews I changed a few things.  I diced the chicken and sauteed it with salt and pepper, the garlic, and the mushrooms.  I then stirred in the soup and other ingredients.  I layered the spinach in the bottom and then put the whole chicken mixture on top and added the bacon and cheese.  It was very good and the chicken was moist!  I served it with the roasted garlic lemon broccoli from this site and it was an awesome meal.

AMAZING!!!!  I added more cream of mushroom soup and used fresh spinach, but we are making it tonight for a dinner party and we are going to try canned spinach.  I also used the fake bacon bits the first time and my husband didn't like them so try real bacon bits! Very easy to make though and it's even good reaheated!

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  I sauteed the fresh spinach and mushrooms in some butter and then placed the raw chicken breasts on top.  I put it in the oven at 350 while I prepared the sauce.  Then I poured on the sauce as soon as it was ready and finished baking.

This is the first time I have ever tried this dish and I think it's my new favorite! This is delicious! I made it according to another user review- sauteed the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter, cover the bottom of the pan, placed the raw chicken on top, then added the sauce and baked it for about 35-40 min (I also left out the bacon because I can't stand the stuff). It is amazing. The chicken is moist and tender and the sauce is soooo good! I recommend doubling the sauce. Must try!

This was WONDERFUL!!!! So flavorful & tasty! I wasn't sure we'd like it because me & my family don't love cooked spinach, but you couldn't even taste it, just gave it great texture & color!  I cut up the chicken, seasoned it & cooked it in a fry pan on the stove in some oil first. I finely chopped up frozen spinach (my family doesn't like big chunks of spinach) & put in casserole dish first. Then I layered the cooked chicken next. Then I mixed the sauce ingredients in the frying pan & poured over chicken & spinach. Then I grated mozzarella & sprinkled over that. Baked in oven at 350 for 30 minutes until bubbly. Smelled HEAVENLY!

I baked the chicken in the casserole. It turned out really well. The mushroom garlic sauce will definately be used in other recipes. I had an issue with the spinach being over powering. Next time I'll either use half the amount, or try fresh/frozen instead of canned.

SO SO good. I followed other reviews and used fresh spinach, sauteed the spinach with mushrooms and garlic, and then placed it in the bottom of the pan. I also used shredded, cooked rotisserie chicken and that made it so easy and so delicious! You can definitely omit the bacon if you are looking for a lighter variation. I have served it with pasta, rice, even gnocchi. Very decadent and great leftover.

This was really good and my family isn't big on cooked spinach.  I did make quite a few changes (sorry!) to make it a bit healthier.  I only used a tablespoon of butter, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and didn't top it with mozzerella cheese or bacon.  We didn't miss anything.  We also served it with rice that made it a nice filling meal.

Delicious!  I loved this.  It was rich and creamy and tasted so great on top of pasta.  If I had had some garlic bread to go with it, it would have been perfect.  But seriously, this is like a meal ordered at a fancy restaurant.  After I started making it, I found out my hubby didn't like spinach, so he didn't like it.....but me and my 11-month-old sure did like it.  She loved the chicken.

I used leftover spinach and ricotta filling from lasagna for the base of this dish and added dried (reconstituted) shiitake mushrooms. Sauteed garlic and sliced onion and put that over the chicken breasts that I browned in the pan. To the sauce I added milk instead of half-and-half and crumbled bacon right into the sauce. I found the sauce quite salty; next time I will use reduced sodium soup. You certainly don't need to add additional salt because of the bacon and parmesan cheese. Topped the chicken breasts with sliced Gouda and baked at 350 for 20 minutes only. Came out perfect and tasty!

Definitely would give this 5 stars after I made the following changes.  Drop the bacon and replace that salt and fat with a box of frozen artichoke hearts.  Use fresh spinach and a healthy Cream of Mushroom canned with less salt and fat.  Plus cut the mozzarella cheese in half.  And lastly I sauted the sliced mushrooms in the butter to brown them.  Come one America - get healthy cut out the extra fat, salt and add more vegetables!!

Excellent dish, even my son (who is a picky eater) ate it!  We ate ours over angel hair pasta.  I sauteed the spinach and mushrooms with some garlic and butter before adding it to the baking dish.  That was the only change I made, everything else I followed exactly and it was delicious :)

Made this for some guests and we all loved it. As suggested by other reviewers, I cut up the chicken instead of leaving it whole and cut the amount of spinach in half, and it came out perfect. Will definitely make again!

I made it exactly as the recipe called for and I really didn't like this. As someone else stated, the first few bites were pretty good, but I couldn't finish it towards the end, it almost made me nauseous. Waaaaay too much spinach. My boyfriend loved it, but I think he was just trying to not hurt my feelings.

I used fatfree half and half, and it worked just fine.  This is delicious!  filling, makes a lot...  You could even cube the chicken before puting it in to make it easier to serve. YUM!

I made this for company the other day because it looked impressive.  Well that's where the compliments end.  This sauce does not work with the spinach and parm.  Will not make this again.

cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, 
used real bacon... next time will try w/o butter

update: sauteed spinach and mushrooms first this time, used bite sized chicken pieces, followed ingredients list to the "T". Forgot about my previous thought that it didn't need butter... And after it was finished, I agree with my previous assessment.. too much butter!

My family enjoyed this casserole.  I doubled the ingredients and made it with the following changes. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and lightly sauted. I fried a few slices of bacon, then fried the mushrooms and garlic in the bacon grease.  When browned I added 3 10 oz boxes of frozen chopped spinach (squeezed dry first) along with remaining ingredients and stirred over heat til warm.  I put 2 cups of the mozarella in casserole and 2 cups on top.  After baking I tossed with 1 lb of farfalle pasta.

Made it as the recipe said, except I didn't have any mozzarella so just used more Parmesan cheese.  Also didn't know to drain the canned spinach so it was very watery.  Next time I will follow the advice from VICSGARDEN.

Absolutely wonderful.  I did cut up the chicken into small pieces and browned them in butter on stove top.  Also added 1/2 cup white wine to the sauce and then served the casserole over bow tie pasta. Best ever....5 stars.

Really good, I didn't bake the chicken first I made the sauce and then added the chicken to it and simmered for about 10 minutes on the stove top. Then added the sauce to the raw spinach and mushroom cooked at 375 for 30 minutes. Took about 45 mins to prep and cook. Not bad feels fancy but could easily do on a week day.

I don’t know what all the hype is about this recipe.  I took other reviewer’s advice and used fresh spinach and sautéed it in a little butter and garlic (drained juice). I won’t be making this again!

I followed the recipe for the most part. I made the changes others did with skipping the first step, I did not read the reviews until after going to the store so I had canned spinach. I imagine much better with fresh spinach. Mine was a little liquidy and I have no clue why though. Overall this was great, and the sauce was awesome!!  I will be eating the left overs for sure, and also making it again. I did use pre-sliced baby bella mushrooms, they are the best for every dish!

Our family loved this recipe.  We only made slight changes and that was to use real bacon and fresh spinach.  We loved it the way it is but might try to lighten it up next time.  Very yummy!  Thanks for the recipe  :)

This is delicious! I used chicken tenders, and omitted the bacon. Didn't miss any flavor, though. I love this recipe, and froze half to see how well it would freeze.

I have been making recipes from this website since 2003, this is my first review!  This recipe is fantastic.  I followed other reviewer's advice to skip the pre-baking step.  Used fresh spinach, sauteed with butter, garlic, then layered that on the bottom, the sauce mixture, the chicken, more sauce.  350 for 25 then 10 minutes more with cheese on top.  REALLY REALLY good.

This was fantastic.  I used fresh spinach which I tossed with the mushrooms and some diced onion.  I also cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and tossed them in a little butter until they were cooked through.  I served it over angel hair pasta and it got rave reviews at dinner.  This is a good recipe to double, too, if you're having extra guests for dinner.  It's definitely a keeper.

My family loves this dish. I try to stay as close to the original recipe but it doesn't work out that way. Spouse went fishing and we have ahi (tuna) for a while, so when I made it with ahi, it turned out better than the other variations according to them. I use whatever ingredients are on hand. We grow spinach, sweet basil, green onions and lime which I used for the recipe. I started by searing ahi in olive oil, garlic and lime juice. Removed the ahi steak from pan and cut in cubes. I drained the drippings and placed in freezer for future use.  In separate skillet, I sauteed garlic, green onions in olive oil, lime juice and added a little basil. I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I made white sauce by cutting approximately 8oz fat free cream cheese into chunks and placed in skillet on lower heat, added approximately 1c whole milk so cheese would not burn. I whisked in Italian dressing mix I had in the cupboard. I was careful to skim the top ingredients in the bag, leaving the salt behind. I added dressing mix to taste and didn't use the whole bag. For that subtle kick, I added 1/2t Korean garlic chili paste (clear jar with green top and rooster on it). If cream sauce too thick, I added more lime juice.  Steamed spinach. I didn't have mushrooms, mozerella cheese and my family is not fan of bacon bits. I layered as suggested, topped with shredded parmesan and baked for 15minutes. Served with plain sourdough bread slices.

This was a great starter recipe. With a little fine tweaking, I was able to make it a bit healthier. I used store bought rotisserie chicken & shredded it (breast meat only). Only change I made to the sauce was using cream of chicken instead of mushroom. I added steamed broccoli & julienne carrots & omitted the spinach, bacon & mushrooms (our preference) and used shredded skim mozzarella. I layered steamed veggies, then 1/2 the sauce, then chicken, then a second layer of each finishing with a light coating of the shredded cheese. Baked for approx 20-30 mins @ 350. It was delish. I made it for just my husband & I but our 3 boys & their girlfriends wiped most of it out. Next time I will make a double batch and may add steamed cauliflower. Served with a salad.

I like this recipe...I will make it again!  If your looking for very low fat...without losing the richness...I used fat free half an half, and 98% fat free condensed soup. In my opinion the parmesean/mozzerella are not necessary, the other ingredients make the recipe.My other suggestion would be to brine chicken before cooking to hold in the juices/flavor.

This was an excellent chicken dish. I doubled the recipe, and made few changes. I also used fresh spinich as other did. I added 1 onion which I sauteed & then added fresh spinich & cooked it till wilted. I used 2 bags & would probably add more next time, as I loved the flavor & another bag would not be over powering at all. I increased the mushrooms, using a combination of portabello & shitake. I didn't add italian seasoning, but did add a pinch of oregano & about a tsp. of basil, Tbs. of parsley, and pepper to taste.  I also cut up split chicken breasts, which I cooked on the outside only (pink inside).  I can't wait to make again. Just loved it.

Excellent recipe.  I used a couple of cups of fresh spinach, which I sauted in a small amount of margarine before spreading across the bottom of my baking pan.  I used fat free half and half and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup in an attempt to make this somewhat healthier.  I microwaved 4 strips of turkey bacon to create the bacon pieces.  I also had some leftover roasted chicken (from a previous night's dinner) I used in place of the chicken breasts.  I baked as directed and served over garden rotini pasta.  Tasted great!

YUM!  I made this for my family and they LOVED it!  Even my very picky 10 year old cleaned her plate.  I can't wait to try it again using fresh spinach and shrimp!

I just made this for dinner and it was wonderful! I did follow the advice of the other reviewers and skipped the first step. The flavors of this recipe are wonderful. I didn't have any mushrooms and since it was the ONLY ingredient I didn't have I didn't bother going to the store to get some. I will definitely have to try it with the mushrooms next time though. My husband said there will be a next time for this recipe, so that's a good sign!

This is unbelievably good!  I don't add any spinach or mushrooms cause my husband would never even look at this dish if it had that in it.  Otherwise, I do omit 2T of  the butter and instead use some of the bacon drippings. And, I only use 1t of minced garlic.  Otherwise, the remaining ingredients stay the same and YUMMY!!!!  This one is for sure a keeper!

OMG!  Made only four minor changes: Used fresh herbs and spinach, canned mushrooms, and salted chicken a little before pre-baking.  SO GOOD!  UMMM!  JEEZ!  OMG! Awesome, will make again.

Made his for Sunday dinner and wish I doubled the recipe - there were no leftovers!  My two teenage kids made a face when they learned there was spinache, but after they tasted it, said it was "yummy" - My 19 year old who lives on take-out, had two servings - I didn't think this was a lot of work to make at all.

This is really the first thing I've made from AllRecipies (and I've made a lot!) that was highly ranked and contained ingredients that I liked that I thought was downright not to my liking when I made it.  It tasted salty and creamy!

I use a bag of fresh spinach and 8ounces of fresh mushrooms.  I also brown the chicken on the stove top like other's have suggested.  Whenever I prepare this for dinner guests, they always ask for the recipe.

This is delicious! Everyone absolutely loved it! I made a few changes. I made my own bacon bits. I used chicken tender strips instead of breast halves, and I cooked the chicken on the stove using the bacon grease. I also used fresh baby spinach (two bags) and sauteed the spinach and mushrooms in the bacon grease as well. I followed all other directions from the recipe exactly. Next time I make this, I will double the sauce and serve over a bed of fettucini noodles. This recipe has WONDERFUL flavor!

Made this dish, but did not cook the chicken first.  I followed other reviewers and cooked the chicken in the sauce.  I also did not have cream of mushroom so I used reduced fat cream of chicken and put it over whole wheat egg noodles.  It was amazing!  My parnter loved it so much he wanted to strap the bowl to his chin and eat it (his words). Will make again for sure

This is DELICIOUS!  I changed a few things from the original recipe.  I sauted fresh spinach and the fresh mushrooms in a separate pan with a little bit of olive oil and some fresh garlic.  I placed this mixture on the bottom of the casserole dish.  Meanwhile, I also sauted the minced garlic, lemon juice and then added cream of mushroom soup, Italian seasoning, 1/2 and 1/2, and parmesan.  I had some left over pesto from another recipe, so I put in about a Tbsp and a half to this mixture.  I placed raw chicken breasts onto of the spinach mixture.  Poured the soup mixture on top of that and then topped with mozzarella and bacon bits.  Wow!!! I am making this again soon!

LOVED this recipe. Made for a party. I had so many compliments. Used 16 chicken breasts cut in half  and used grated Asiago and Romano instead of parmesan. This is going to become a regular dish in my house.  :o)

I loved this recipe it was so good. All I changed was I used frozen spinach, thawed and used 1 1/2 cup half-and-half for a creamer sauce. I didn't sauté the spinach and mushroom( I didn't want to over cook the mushrooms.) It came out perfect. Thank you!

I gave it 3 stars because I thought it was pretty plain by itself. I added some pasta, added some chicken broth to the sauce and thought it came out much better then!

So much flavor!! I cooked Amish chicken strips in a pan, set aside, then made the buttery, mushroom and spinach sauce in the same pan to get some of the chicken flavor. I used frozen chopped spinach instead of canned, less butter and 2% milk instead of half and half. I put brown rice on the bottom of the pan, put the chicken on top and then topped with the creamy sauce. It cooked for 30 mins, the rice wasn't quite done so I added chicken broth and mozzarella and baked for another 15 mins. Next time I'll cook the rice before baking it. Very yummy!!

Great recipe.  I made this for family and friends last night and I heard after each bite... this is soo yummy.  made just a few changes: I sauteed fresh spinach in a little butter.  Lightly browned the chicken in a little bacon grease, cut the bacon prior to cooking and waited until the last 5 minutes to add both the bacon and the cheese to the top.  I was worried the bacon would get soggy and did without the mushrooms, since we don't like them.  Baked at 325 for 30 minutes. Was delicious!

DELICIOUS!  I loved the sauce & would make the sauce again for another dish.  I browned the chicken first while I was sauteeing the spinach (next time I'll use frozen instead of canned).  I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, fresh ground black pepper, & a country mix of seasons (Aldi's).  I used similar seasonings for the spinach.   SO GOOD!  The mozzarella did taste a little salty to me, but it browned beautifully on top.

I did what the review said and sauteed the spinach and mushrooms in butter. But then I added alll the remaining ingrediants into the pan. and heated through. I placed half of the mixture on the bottom of a baking dish. Seasoned my raw chicken with salt and pepper. layed the chicken over the spinach mixture then covered with the remaining mixture. Sprinkled real bacon bits over that and cooked in the oven at 350 for 30 min. Added my cheese and baked an additional 10 min.  Turned out so moist and delicouse!

This was good...quite rich though.  I would probably skip the half and half or use milk instead next time.  I sauteed the spinach and mushrooms w/ garlic.  I didn't bother to cook the chicken first as I don't see it necessary.  I cubed the chicken and then just cooked the casserole for 50 minutes.  It came out great.

wow! easily a new favorite.. i chopped up a fourth of an onion, threw in some (well lots of) minced garlic with 3 tbs real butter, and threw the chicken in on low-med heat. seasoned the chicken with the italian seasoning, garlic salt, and pepper. covered periodically, then put the chicken in a baking dish.  i cooked 4 slices of bacon in the microwave and put the noodles in to cook. added a half a fresh squeezed lemon, cream of mushroom, parm , mozzo, spinach, and portabellas to the pan after removing the chicken and cooked until the spinach was wilted. poured the mixture over the chicken and bacon, and cooked at 350 for 15 min til bubbly! served over noodles, almost like a pasta sauce instead of a casserole! WONDERFUL! my fam lovvvvvved it and said they WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING! that's hard to come by!

I had to modify this recipe for what I had on hand and I halved the recipe.  After using the substitutions, I made it according to directions except I didn't precook the chicken.  My substitutions were 2 cloves of fresh garlic, lime juice instead of lemon, 8 oz. of sour cream in place of the soup, 2% milk for the half-and-half, half a bag of fresh spinach instead of canned, and four slices of cooked bacon. My chicken was still partially frozen so I sliced it into chunks and laid it on top of the fresh spinach and mushrooms.  Since the chicken was frozen, I baked it at 400 for 50 minutes in a casserole dish, adding the bacon to the top in the last 5.  Not sure if it was the spinach or the chicken that made it a little runny but it was very tasty and made an excellent sauce over mostaccioli.  Even more fresh spinach could have been used since it cooks down so much.   I know - a lot of changes from the original but it was a great recipe to begin with and easy to modify!  Thanks, Bryan!

The dressing in and of itself is worth keeping this recipe! I used canned mushrooms and about 10 oz of fresh spinach instead which I sauteed in evoo before putting on the bottom of my 9x13. I didn't cook my chicken prior, either; I just cubed it and placed in on top of mushroom/spinach, then poured the sauce over and baked about a half hour (I omitted the bacon.) The chicken was a little bland, but the SAUCE WAS DELICIOUS!!! I served over bow tie pasta and everyone loved it! It was soooo simple! This would be an easy meal to throw together from your stovetop if you had frozen fully cooked chicken strips you could pop in the microwave.

This sauce for this recipe has wonderful flavor, which I would liken almost to an alfredo sauce.  I subbed 1/2 & 1/2 with whole milk, canned spinach for fresh, and bacon bits for real bacon.  I also did not precook the chicken.  Instead cooked with the spinach, shrooms, sauce, and raw chicken on 350 for 30 minutes (I had thick breasts) and then added the mozzarella and bacon to cook for about 15 minutes on 400.  I served it with brown rice to put a little nutrition as this is not the most nutritious meal you can serve!!

DELISH!  Can I just say, the whole house smelled heavenly for hours after this meal :) I followed the advice of others and cooked the chicken along with everything else.  I put the spinach and mushrooms down in the baking dish, placed the raw chicken on top of that, then added the rest of the ingredients as directed.   It turned out just great (and tasted great as leftovers, too!)

I: 1.) Sauteed fresh spinach and mushrooms in butter and a couple cloves of garlic before I put them on the bottom of the baking pan. 2.) Added a layer of cooked, thin egg noodles b/w the vegetables and the chicken 3.) Used lower sodium cream of mushroom soup and whole milk, instead of half and half.  I also added some oregano and black pepper to the sauce.  I thought it was excellent; my family is picky, though, and it wasn't their favorite.  I thought I could sneak mushrooms and spinach into the casserole.  Alas, they noticed.   I would definitely recommend this to others, however.

I didn't really get the flavor I was looking for from this one. The chicken takes much longer than 35 minutes to cook, more like an hour plus. The bacon pretty much made the meal, so for the overall taste to hinge on a single ingredient like that is unimpressive. I wouldn't make this one again.

This was delicious.  The only change I made was to not cook the chicken first but cut it into cubes and bake it with the spinach and sauce.  I actually forgot to put the bacon bits on but it was still fantastic! My husband who doesnt like leftovers actually asked for it in his lunch the next day! We will be having this again!

Lots of flavor, easy to make and something my husband would eat. I did this recipe just as it was and loved the way it turned out. It make too much for us though so I froze the leftovers and got them out later. Was happy to find that it freezes and reheats well.

This recipe is absolutely amazing.  I used to eat it all the time when I was an omnivore.  Currently, I imagine that it will be turned into a vegetarian course, made with soy chicken fillets and tempeh bacon.  Om nom nom.

I did what others suggested by sauteeing the spinach first in butter. I put the chicken in the over raw at 350. It took about an hour total since they were thick pieces, but they were soooo juicy and the flavors of the sauce were amazing. Hubby loved it too.

I took great liberties with this recipe because of the ingredients I had on hand and because my kids kept interrupting the process.  I put thawed, drained frozen spinach in the bottom of the dish, layered vegetarian chicken that I had browned, and covered with sliced mushrooms.  For the sauce, I eyeballed all of the amounts.  I threw some butter, garlic, and a few squirts of lemon juice in a pan, added cream of celery soup and a little soymilk to thin it out and shook some italian seasoning on top.  I poured that over the whole dish and topped with strips of browned smart bacon.  I covered it all with an italian cheese blend and baked at 400 for 20 min.  This tasted fabulous, and my husband devoured it.  Just wanted to point out how forgiving the recipe was to all kinds of modifications!

Enjoyed this recipe.  I too used fresh baby spinach.  I layered this in my slow cooker insert and baked for an hour then put it on low and transported it to potluck.  Got good reviews.  I served it over pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good!  I changed a couple of things.  I added half of a large sauted onion to the sauce.  I sauted the spinach and mushrooms before adding them to the dish.  I also did not pre cook the chicken.  I layered the spinach and mushrooms one the bottom of the dish, then the raw chicken on top, and covered with the sause and real bacon bits.  I cooked it all at 350 for 30 minutes.  Added the mozzarella and then put back in the oven for 10 more minutes.  To finish it off,  I placed it all under the broiler for 3-5 minutes just to make the cheese a little brown and crispy.  It was awesome and I will totally be making this again!

Good way to get spinach into your diet.  Much better tasting after refrigerated 24 hours and eaten 2nd time around. Used jar mushrooms, and frozen spinach (canned spinach sounded to sick) Cut chicken up into bite size pieces. Beware lactose intolerant people this is very creamy and rich...but good.

Great mix of flavors. My children really liked it, and they can be picky when it comes to things with spinach. Made it with the chicken which I grilled on the bbq first.

I thought this was good, but left out the mushrooms because I just don't like them.  Next time, I will definitely use less spinach (half or even less).  It was just overpowering with the amount called for.  With that adjustment, it will be phenomenal!

This recipe convinced some of my friends that mushrooms and copious amounts of spinach can taste great! I doubled the amount for the cream sauce and it turned out fantastic. The leftovers were even better after allowing everything to set!

Excellent!  My kids loved it, I loved it!  I would use unsalted canned spinach next time.  It was a little too salty because of the regular canned spinach.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe!

I had a catering event tonight and got raving reviews. I did use both cream of mushroom and cream of cicken soup. I also added onions and some black pepper. I seared the chicken first and then baked. I used fresh spinach sauteed with the mushrooms and onions in the bacon fat. I used peppered bacon. I put some mozzarella in the sauce and was going to smother with mozarella at end, but  forgot. Still got outstanding reviews and an invitation to cater their Christmas dinner. Thanks a million. Marilyn

Very good recipe -- I did not cook the chicken first & it was fine.  I found the parmesan to be a little over powering so next time think I will use less or use a different grated cheese.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. My kids loved it and they didn't even notice they were eating spinach. I found as others in past reviews that you do not need to cook the chicken first. Just lay it on top and cook for 25-30 min. then add cheese and bake an additional 10 min. it comes out fantastic. I put it over top some buttered noodles with parmasean cheese.

EXCELLENT!!    I modified this recipe a bit.  First, I fried four strips of bacon, crumbled and set aside. I doubled the amount of mushrooms called for.  Sautéing in minced garlic and some of the bacon grease until golden.  I sautéed one and a half large bags of spinach with minced garlic, white wine, and salt, until wilted and most of the liquid was gone.  I pan fried it the chicken in bacon grease until golden on both sides. Continuing to use the same pan, I mixed together the mushroom sauce mixture, scraping up the brown bits in the pan for added flavor.  I decreased the oven temperature to 350 degrees, and baked approximately 10 minutes (the time will vary depending on the size of the chicken breasts), just until juices ran clear.  To be honest, I was Leery of trying this recipe, as I usually do not care for recipes containing canned soups.  This recipe is a definite exception.  UPDATE:  I decided to try a low fat version of this recipe by using 98% fat free mushroom soup, 1TBSP butter, and milk instead of half-n-half.  Prepared this way it is only an okay recipe.  I'll be sticking to the higher fat version.

INCREDIBLE! Even my 10 month old who HATES vegetables of any kind ate this!  I did it a little different to save time and make sure the chicken stayed more moist. 1. I used a bag of frozen spinach, thawed. then sauteed the spinach with a little minced garlic to remove excess moisture. 2. I layered the spinach in the bottom of the baking dish and added 1 can of artichoke hearts quartered since I hate mushrooms. 3. I used 3 thawed boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them in to chunks and put that over the spinach and artichoke hearts in the baking dish. 3. I prepared the sauce as it said to, adding 1/4 cup mozzarella to the mixture. 4. Baked it at 350 for 30 mins, then added 1 cup mozzarella to the top and baked it for another 10 mins.  It was a little runny so i let it sit for about 20 mins. 4. I cooked angel hair pasta and served the casserole over the pasta.  So Yummy! I will make this a family go to recipe. Even tasted better the next day!

I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and did not bake the chicken first (skip step 1). This allows the chicken to cook in the sauce mixture and it comes out very tender (I did increase the cooking time in the oven though). I also did not put the cheese and bacon bits on the top and everyone in my family raved at how good it was! I think it would still be great with the cheese/bacon bits, but our preference was without. It's a great recipe though. Thanks for sharing!

I used cream of chicken soup because that was all I had on hand. I didn't bake my chicken, I sauteed it in a little EVOO and minced garlic before I added it to the casserole ingredients, just because so many reviewers complained of it making the chicken bland. I made no other changes. My family seemed to just be okay with this dish, my sister in law flipped for it. I sent all the leftovers home with her. I didn't think that my family could finish another whole meal of this. This dish would be better cooked with lower calorie ingredients as it's incredibly rich and heavy as is. I'd like to play with this recipe again to see if I can't make it lighter.

Very good, but the recipe is much more complicated than it needs to be!  I did not pre-cook the chicken (cut breasts in half), used fresh spinach and mushrooms, poured the sauce over it in a baking dish and it was excellent.  I did not follow quantities on the spinach and mushrooms, either, but guessed at how much we actually would consume.  The kids thought it looked gross but my husband and I loved it!

I've just recently began enjoying several Chicken Florentine Casserole recipes. This is a very decent one: a great base for making some wonderful changes: adding sliced water chestnuts or capers. Topping with breadcrumbs is good, too.

This is my husbands new favorite. I omit the bacon to cut down on some of the fat. I also used frozen spinach. I had to add some milk to the sauce, as it was a little thicker than I like. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Delicious! I am not fond of cooking probably because I am NOT good at it. I tried this recipe and my husband and I both were so surprised how good it really was. The bonus was I did it-- thanks goes to the original submitted recipe. I didn't have the fresh mushrooms but followed the rest of the instructions. I WILL be making this again and looking on this website for more recipes that will make my cooking talents seem more professional!

Good flavor, but way too cheesy and buttery.  If I make it again I'll probably halve the butter/cheese, use a little less spinach and more chicken.  This was basically spinach cheese casserole with some chicken pieces...I wanted more meat.

This is wonderful! For time purposes, I ended up slicing the chicken breasts & I cooked them on the stovetop. I added white wine to the spinach/mushroom mixture before adding the can of soup. I used fat free milk instead of half & half and I only used a small handful of parm! Then I added the chicken to the sauce/veggie mixture & I let it boil for a little while. Well, I believe the wine & fat free milk made my mixture too thin-- so I ended up having waaay too much sauce! Again for time purposes I added cooked rice to the sauce until all the sauce was absorbed. This way I ended up with a one pot dish essentially & I saved a lot of calories by omitting the mozza cheese. I didn't follow the instructions exactly but I did follow the ingredients almost to a tee. The taste is to die for! This is a great recipe & I'll make it again... as instructed next time :)

I followed the suggestion to pan fry the spinach and mushrooms, and then bake the uncooked chicken on top with the sauce.  I added half an onion and 4 oz. of chopped, roasted pepper to the saute and it was delicious!  I added flat parsley to the top with the mozzarella cheese.  Next time I might ad new potatoes and reduce the butter... good stuff, thanks!

This was an excellent dish. My family loved this. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of celery and it worked out great. I sauteed the mushroom in the butter first then added fresh spinach (about 6 oz) and sauteed it until it wilted. I didn't precook the chicken, I just placed it on the bed of spinach/mushrooms and then baked this for 45 minutes and it turned out great. This was a little soupy though, but I'm not sure how to correct that.

This was an easy and delicious dish. Although next time I would use fresh spinach and sauté it first, as I was not a huge fan on the canned spinach.  I made a few modifications, I used fresh herbs in replace of Italian seasoning and I omitted the bacon.

I've never made nor had Chicken Florentine before this recipe. My roommates gave up rice, bread, pasta & red meat for Lent.  Since it was my turn to cook - I came across this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly. It was just perfect.  Everyone in our house loved it, adults and kids alike.  I made a double batch so we did have some left overs.  The next day it was used with omlettes and those were excellent too.  I have made this again, and everyone was very happy.  Since there are lots of us, I actually cut the chicken up in cubes this time and this worked out better.  This is very good - thank you for sharing!

Not bad there was enough cream sauce to feed an army though.  I did change the recipe a bit. I replaced the Cream of Mushroom with Campbell’s healthy choice low fat and sodium cream of mushroom.  I used 12 slices of precooked real bacon (way too much), Skim milk instead of half and half and Romano instead of Parmesan Cheese.  I skipped the precooking instructions and laid the raw chicken in the pan, and cooked the entire thing uncovered at 350 for 40 minutes.  The Chicken came out perfectly tender.  However I found the cream sauce to be a little over powering perhaps I might have enjoyed it more without the bacon and less heavy on the Romano cheese.  I found that while eating it I drank 3 glasses of water so maybe too much flavor for my taste.  I will probably try it again with a few more changes.

Like so many others, I sauteed the chicken first in a pan, and I also cooked and crumbled my own bacon. I also used regular 2% milk instead of half and half, and the sauce was still very good/creamy. I used fresh spinach, about two ready-to-go bags worth instead of the canned. I followed everything else and it came out great---served it over bow-tie pasta. The only thing I would change next time is trying to experiment to cut down on the fat content.

This was great and my family thought so too. I'm could go without the bacon but my husband feels that the bacon needs to stay. I also changed the recipe by baking the chicken for 35 minutes at 350 with everything on top of it. It was very moist and flavorful!

I too cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and sauteed on stove top in a little olive oil. Made my own bacon bits(6 pcs of bacon)  I only used 1 cup of mozzarella,I put it in the sauce w/the parmesan and 1/2 of the chicken. Layered spinach, mushrooms, 1/2 of chicken, then sauce w/rest of chicken, also dusted the top w/parm. Served over farfalle(bowtie) pasta-YUM! My boyfriend really enjoyed-he's having the leftovers for lunch today!

My husband and I thought this recipe was amazing!  I also made a few changes.  I coated the chicken with garlic salt and cajun seasoning, then fried it in olive oil.  It turned out very tender!  I had fresh and frozen spinach so used both, used 3 large cloves of garlic, and added 1/2 c. of sour cream to the sauce.  I cut up the chicken into pieces instead of leaving them whole.  This is one of my husband's new favorite recipe's!

Really good recipe.  I used canned spinach but I think it would have been much better with fresh however, my husband and daughter that it was fantastic the way it was.  I also used the George Foreman grill to cook my chicken and it turned out perfect!

This was great, my husband and daughter loved it and she's 9. I did what some of the other reviews had suggested and used fresh spinich and did not cook the chicken first. Very creamy and filling. Great for a cold winter night.

Followed other reviewers suggestions and only baked chicken once. Also used fresh spinach sauted and evaporated milk. Good, but a little heavy for my tastes. My husband loved it and gave it a 5 although he mentioned that it probably wasn't the healthiest dish. If it hadn't bee for him loving it, I would have given it a 3.

I used a george foreman grill to quickly cook the chicken breasts instead of baking which saves time and ensures that juicy chicken breasts are served. Cheese lovers will delight in this recipe. I served it with pasta thought I'd like to try it with brown rice next time. I'll definitely try this again.

OMG! We loved this! I didn't think I've ever rated a recipe before, but this one caused me to share my 2 cents.  I copied the other reviewers and baked the chicken on top of the saute.  I didn't include the lemon juice but all other ingredients.  Delicious.

This was absolutely one of the best tasting dishes I have ever eaten!! My husband prepared this dish last night and all of us, including my 11 and 12 year old picky eaters loved it. We didn't change anything in the recipe, made it exactly as is. The only thing I might do differently next time is leave out the fresh mushrooms since my husband is the only one in the family who likes them. We will definitely be making this again in the near future!

The canned spinach ruined the dish.  If I make it again I would definitely leave that out or substitute another veggie.

I think this dish was good, but not so good that it's worth making again. It was VERY expensive. I doubled the recipe for our family and spent over $30 on ingredients for a 10x13 casserole. Ouch! I adjusted the recipe as per many suggestions (pre-cooked, shredded chicken; frozen (squeezed out) spinach; real bacon; less than half the Italian seasoning). Flavor was tasty, but not something to rave over for the cost.

This was good, but not great. I think grilled chicken would work better. I'm not a big fan of whole chicken breast, you never can get all those ribbons of fat out. I might make this again with the alteration of using grilled chicken.

This was excellent!  I served over pasta to savor the taste of the sauce.  That way nothing went to waste.  I only used 1 can of spinach so that the dish was not overpowered by it.  I would absolutely make this again and again.

Following the exact recipe, 4 stars.  I made it a second time following others' suggestions, 5 stars!  Do NOT use canned spinach.  I used frozen and it was SO much better.  Chopped chicken and fried in skillet as well.

I am a beginner cooker, This was the first I ever tried and it came out great! There are 7 people in my family so I doubled the recipe. I did not add spinach and I took a suggestion about not adding too much Italian Seasoning. I added about 2 teaspoons for a doubled recipe. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces, and I cooked it until almost done on the stove instead of baking it first(with PAM cooking spray) I served this on a plate with pasta. My whole family loved it! They all thanked me for the meal and said I did wonderful! This food is delicious! Just make sure to go back and read some suggestions, it really helps!

Fantastic!  Made this for dinner last night and the chicken was sooo juicy and tender!  I followed others advice and used fresh spinach instead of canned.  I cut down on the amount of Italian Seasoning as I thought the amount stated was a little much.  This will go in my recipe box!!!!

I loved it!  My roommate, who hates spinach even had seconds!  The only thing I would do the next time (and there definitely will be a next time) would be to go with half the cheese on top, or a pan with more surface area.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! and easy, always an extra bonus!  I did substitute the 1/2 & 1/2 for lowfat milk and accidently put 3 tbsp garlic, but we are garlic lovers and it was delicious!

Love the chicken spinach combination. Don't understand why so many reviewers changed it into something very different. To suit our tastes I browned the chicken on each side because that is the way we like it - otherwise made as instructed.  Thanks for a tasty and reliable recpe.

Delicious!!! I also sliced the chicken breast and piled the slices on top of the spinach and mushrooms! I added a tablespoon of capers to the sauce as well. My husband thought it was a bit too spinachy so next time I am going to use one can spinach and a ½ cup of rice in the bottom layer. I also omitted step one by cookinging my chicken breast in the crock pot in chicken broth on low during the day, By the time I got home from work they were done and I just assembled the rest of the dish!! Will make again very soon!!!

Good but needed tweaking. This is a good, solid recipe but it did need some adjusting. It was just a little too soupy and cheesy for us. I made it a second time and added extra spinach and finely chopped broccoli. That worked better for us.

this recipe was great... i made a slight change though: instead of baking the chicken initially, i pan seared it for a few minutes on a high flame and threw it in the baking tray after sauteing the spinach.

next time, i'd leave out the bacon bits since i felt it didn't blend in well with the dish, and i'd definitely reduce the butter so i didn't end up with a pool after baking; but overall, this was a brilliant recipe :)

Very rich. Would probably use fresh cooked spinach instead of canned next time. My boyfriend loved it so much he ate the rest of mine too. I put the chicken over rotini pasta which was nice.

I gave this recipe five stars as it has the potential to be a fabulous dish.  I used leftovers from a chicken I cooked in the crockpot so I avoided the first part in having pre-cooked chicken.  I also used canned mushrooms which were fine, but fresh would have been better.  I did use fresh bacon, about 4 pieces, and I wish I'd made more.  It gave the dish an excellent flavor.  The dish was a bit rich on it's own but my husband loved it so I think it was just me.  However, for leftovers I made some noodles to go with it and even my one year old loved it!  So, after being husband/baby approved, here are my suggestions:
-Use fresh bacon, at least 4 pieces but mores better.
-Canned mushrooms/spinach are fine but fresh would probably be better(follow previous users' suggestions).
-Cook some sort of noodles to go with it, but don't add until casserole is done(I used penne and spaghetti noodles).
*I've also thought about making this into a pizza, just add crust and cut the sauce back, maybe add some feta cheese too.  All in all, a great success with lots of possibilities.

This is a good casserole, and my 2-year old ate it, which is quite a feat.  I cut my chicken in bite-size pieces and sauteed first and then added it to the sauce before I poured it over the spinach and mushrooms.  Next time, I will probably leave out the fresh mushrooms - just my personal preference.

Great recipe. 
I replaced bacon with prosciutto to give it more of an old school flavor and served it with linguine.  Fam loved it.

This had great flavor!  I followed most of the common modifications (Skipping the first step, adding white wine, cutting chicken into bite-sized pieces, etc).  My only complaint was while in the oven, the sauce became very soupy.  The fam seemed to dig this, except for all the "Green" (Added parsley, as well as the spinach).  My lil' guy said, "You can make this again, Mommy - but no green stuff!"

Wonderful! I did modify it since I try to cook healthy. It worked great with low salt/low fat soup, land-o-lakes fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and part skim mozzerella. I also used two boxes of frozen spinach instead of canned and sauted my chicken on the stovetop rather than baking it in the oven first. A keeper!

The flavor was good. The texture of the canned spinach was kinda gross though, not very appealing looking. But tasty.

Very good recipe. A little on the fatty side, I added a bit too much wine, but it's really good! A lower fat version would get 5 stars for sure!

thanks for a great recipe!

This was great.  I did make the following modifications:  I fried up a few slices of turkey bacon, and in that pan, grilled the chicken and sauteed the mushrooms.  I also used milk rather than half and half and used about 1/2 the amount of cheeses.

This time I used canned spinach but will probably use fresh and sautee it next time.  

The whole family LOVE this one!  Thanks for sharing!

WOW! This was delicious and my husband loved it!!  I used 1 bag of spinach sautéed in cooking wine and garlic and like others suggested I did not cook the chicken before hand. I put raw chicken on spinach and added sauce over it. I covered and baked at 400 for 30 mins and took foil off and added mozzarella  cheese and cooked uncovered till chicken reached 180. 
Can't wait to make this again!

Five stars for excellent taste. Boneless chicken does not need to be prebaked; it dries it out. I skipped Step 1.

The cream of mushroom soup made it very salty, and I hadn't added any salt to the chicken.  I didn't dare use anywhere near that much Italian seasoning.  I used 1 package of frozen spinach and 2 cooked sliced breasts and it was a good amount.  I like the general idea and will make it again with the spinach, chicken, and mushrooms, but will make my own sauce, like the alfredo sauce with evaporated milk on this website.

This was okay not something I would take the time to make again very time consuming and would rather had gone out to eat after all that cooking.  I did add all the extras everyone suggested and it made the recipe what it needed to be without garlic and white wine I don't think I really would have like this.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars as it is written...the spinach was too mushy and flavorless for me and the bacos were way too salty. Otherwise it was nice and easy to prepare. The sauce smelled amazing! I will make this again, but I will use fresh spinach and take some advice from other reviewers.

Really good.  Husband and kids (6,7,&10) all liked.  One said "a little too much spinach".  I would agree, maybe just use one can.  Will definately make again.

This was absolutely by far, the best chicken dish that I have ever made. The flavors were delicious together especially with the bacon. It is even better the next day. This will be added to my "when I want to impress" food list.

Loved it! Very good and very easy. I did use fresh spinach and I added 1/4 cup of white wine. I also omitted the bacon bites. Served over rice

This was really good!! I omitted the mushrooms (my personal preference)and used 1/2 the butter as others suggested. This can be eaten alone or with pasta. Wonderful flavor and sauce!

My husband love this and I thought it was pretty good.  I followed someone else's suggestion to cube the chicken and saute it in a pan with seasoning salt and garlic (I added the garlic here instead of the sauce).  I made the sauce as directed except used skim milk since I didn't have half and half.  I also added a couple of splashes of white wine. I then layered as directed using one bag of frozen spinach and part of 1 can since the frozen wasn't enough to layer the bottom.  The frozen was much more attractive and I swear I could taste the difference...next time I will make sure to have more frozen...canned spinach was ick!  I  I'm not crazy about bacon so I only used 1/3 cup.  I used about 3 cups of mozz cheese baked as directed but used the broiler for the last couple of minutes so that the cheese was nicely browned.  Good leftovers.  I think it will be a 5* next time because I won't use canned spinach.

This dish was truly delicious!  My family cooks alot, so we are serious critics.  My husband especially enjoyed it and says its now his favorite baked chicken dish. A couple of personal tweaks - I used fresh sauteed spinach, instead of canned and I lightly browned the chicken breast in a skillet instead of pre-baking them.  I served the dish over fettuccine, along with a simple cherry tomato salad with balsamiic vinaigrette.  Perfect dish for company!

This was so good.  I used olive oil instead of butter for the garlic saute, also chopped a little onion in there.  Didn't use the bacon bits.  Also, used fresh spinach instead of the canned, it turned out wonderful.  Everyone very much enjoyed!

My family loves this.  I used chicken from a store-bought roasted chicken and and used fresh spinach.  I also used linguini in the middle and added a little more milk and some white wine to get more sauce.  No bacon though.  My hubby says to make more soon.

Just ok to me....this is my 2nd attempt at tihs recipe. Still not amazing to me. I think that spinach from a can is discusting so I used fresh. This time around, I followed reviews and omitted the first step. Next time, I would omit the bacon, toooo many flavors going on for my taste. I probably wouldnt make this again.

We really liked this dish.  I just served fettucine on the side and it was delicious.  If you want more sauce for the pasta, you'll definitely have to double the sauce, but I thought it was great as is.  I did use frozen spinach, canned just didn't sound good.  Perfect blend of flavors, but I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder before baking and sliced them into strips before adding to the casserole.

The chicken is good, but 2 cans of Spinach is WAY too much for this dish.  I enjoy spinach as much as the next person, but I'm no Popeye.

I followed Foxfire2's suggestions and added cooked noodles between the spinach and chicken layer - my husband said this was a 10! I told him a lady on here said her husband wanted it once a week and my husband wanted to know where that lady lived because he's coming over! Fantastic!

This was very good!  I only used half of the Italian seasoning but doubled all of the other ingredients except the garlic - that, I just pressed 3 cloves through the garlic press.  I cooked the chicken in the oven as recipe stated.  However, I shredded it instead of keeping them whole.  I also added about 1/2 a box of fettucini.  Mixed it all together and topped with cheese.  I used Fontina as that is all I had on hand.  It was very rich but super!  Will make again!  Probably in Fall or Winter as it is such a hearty meal.  Also, I used frozen whole leaf spinach.

Whole family loved it. I used frozen spinach because canned just seems yucky to me. I added fettuccini noodles on top of the spinach and mushrooms. Made it in a 9x13 pan and doubled the sauce. I accidentally added too much milk to the sauce but it was OK because the noodles soaked it up. A month or so after I made it my husband mentioned how much he had liked it so I know it's a keeper!

Really rich, yummy chicken dish.  Next time I will use fresh spinach (I used frozen & it was way too over powering).  I used pre-cooked bacon & cut it up - that was great!  Not everyone in my family liked it, but I would make it again.

made this using other suggestions and added pasta.  I also used two cans of cream of mushroom soup to ensure I had enough sauce.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces, and satueed theme in olive oil, garlic, and salt and pepper.  One last thing I used frozen spinach.

This was a good recipe, but with a few changes we would have liked it even better.  Next time, I will use fresh spinach and put a layer of cooked fetuccini on top of the spinach.

This was a hit at our house from the 2 year old on up. I followed the recipe as given,using reduced fat ingredients whenever possible and it was delicious! Although next time I will cut the chicken into bite size pieces and only use 1 cup of cheese. Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!  Very, Very Good!  I followed everything exactly except I did use cream of chicken instead of mushroom, and I used real bacon. The sauce was excellant, like something you would have out, at a fine dining restaurant.

It's a simple recipe, but a little too rich for my family.  I had never used canned spinich and probably won't again.  If I make this recipe again, I would use half the amount of cheese and after cooked set it on a FRESH bed of spinich instead.

My husband loved this.  He said it was like a healthy version of lasagne.  I won't mention the 1/4 cup of butter or the 1/2 & 1/2.  Still, we did enjoy this and since it was just the 2 of us, it was good for dinner 2 nights in a row.  I served it on top of Royal Blend's Texmati white, brown, wild & red rice.

Made this for dinner last night. My 11yr old nephew said the spinach looked like baby poop ...and sadly i agreed. I thought the flavor was pretty good. I fried up some real bacon instead of using the bits.I thought recipe called for way to much cheese.. i only used about 1/2. I think next time, i will omit the cheese all together, use frozen or fresh spinach (canned is way to mushy)or maybe even use brocolli instead.Wont foollow recipe exactly next time but will make again.

Made this last night. Tastes great  and used Progresso Cream of Mush. Soup that you do not have to add water to and didn't use half-half.  It was great.  I think next time, I'll use less spinach and try it with broccoli.

I made this again tonight.  IT WAS AWESOME.  I added another can of cream of mush soup, and deleted some of the cheese.  I used 2 4oz cans of mushrooms (we love em) and all the spinach.  I used real bacon (5) and browned the chicken in the fat.  I used skim milk because I used the bacon grease.  It was WONDERFUL!!!  Also, I made this 1 day in advance and let it sit in the frig!  The flavor was GREAT!

This was a fab dinner! I made it for a crowd and everyone loved it and thought it tasted restaurant-quality. I doubled the recipe so we could eat leftovers all week too. Try making it low fat and it still tastes good.

This was very bland, too much spinach, and just okay.  Now don't get me wrong, my family loves spinach and we love chicken - but there just was not a whole lot of flavor in this recipe.  I will probalby not make this again.

This casserole smells divine in the oven, and has just enough lemon juice to not taste heavy.  Looks great topped with a sprig of rosemary and alongside sauteed red potatoes.  I will DEFININITELY make this again.

This was very good. I decided to omit the mushrooms and bacon bits. Also, I was able to skip the first step by microwaving frozen chicken breasts instead of cooking them in the oven. Another alteration I made was chopping the chicken into small pieces. Next time I might use a little less cheese on top, but overall it was a great recipe!

I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, and sauteed them in oil with the mushrooms. I also added a cup of cooked  rice and just mixed everything togather rather than layering, and I used a 14 oz package of frozen spinach. After making this my husband declared that he hates spinach, so that didn't go over well, but I would probably make this again with broccoli.

My entire family loved this recipe!  The flavors are wonderful, and it is as good or better than many dishes that I have had in nice italian restaurants!  Serve with salad and garlic bread and your set with a delicious meal that you can entertain with.  I will warn you though, it is very rich!

I wanted to serve this over pasta like so many other reviewers had done, but we've had pasta a couple of times already this week.  I put cooked rice in the bottom of the casserole dish and otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I've never had a casserole like this before, but it turned out fabulous- will definitely add to the rotation!

this is great. I used 2% milk to save on calories. I also only cooked the chicken for 10 minutes before I added the rest of the ingredients. Easy and great!!

I liked this recipe, my family didn't care for it because of the spinach. I seasoned the chicken and browned it and then combined everything else into a sauce, sliced the chicken into strips and then poured the sauce over the chicken and baked in the oven. Served it over egg noodles. I used frozen spinach and not as much, chopped it up real fine thinking I could pass it off as "parsley". Didn't work. So other than my family not caring for it I thought it was wonderful.

Delicious flavors, but I will probably double the sauce next time.  I served it over egg noodles and it was a bit dry. I used frozen spinach instead of canned. Otherwise, it's makes for a really great dinner, especially if you're a spinach lover.

It was ok, but not what I expected after reading all of these reviews. Probably won't make it again. My first grader was not fond of it, though he likes spinach, mushrooms and chicken.

This recipe was wonderful! Even my boyfriend's, 10 & 2 year old ate it. The only changes i made were to omit the bacon bits as they were really salty and to use 1/2 the italian seasoning that the recipe called for. I think it may taste better with frozen or fresh spinach but we loved it either way.

This completely satisfies my frequent cravings of creamy sauces and cooked spinach. Making it with chicken is good, but it's also really good with scallops (about 3/4-1 lb. of smaller scallops). I just cook the scallops lightly before adding them in to bake.

This had a pretty good flavor, although I used herbs de provence instead of Italitan seasoning.  Browned chicken in a little olive oil rather than baking first. Only used about 2 teaspoons. Used fresh baby spinach.  Next time I will double the sauce.  Served over brown Basmati rice.  All in all not to bad.  Will make again.

I took this recipe and modified it, to my own tastes and in light of some of the suggestions by other members. I used chicken tenders and cut them into chunks, sauteed them untill cooked in 1/2 the butter, added the mushrooms for the last 4mins. In a sep. pan, I made the sauce however I doubled the lemon juice and half and half (fat free) to make more of a sauce. I used the remaining butter, 1/2 tbls. herbs de provence, and 1 can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup. garlic and parmesean I left the same. Once that was done i stirred in the spinach, and tossed everything together with rigatonne pasta. I did not use bacon or mozerella. 
It ended up being a chicken florentine pasta, instead of a casserole, but I thought it turned out great.

I really liked this recipe. My husband, who never comments on any dish, made sure to say he liked it and wouldn't mind having it again. That's saying ALOT! My two teenage boys liked it as well. I served it over white rice because my family likes less saucy dishes. Thanks for the recipe.

I would give this recipe a 6 if I could....husband says it was the best thing I have ever made.  I too used low fat milk instead of half-and-half and used fresh spinach. Plus I also used pre-seasoned chicken. Will me making this again very soon!

Wow!  This just can't be beat.  I browned the chicken in a little olive oil instead of baking.  I then make the sauce in the same pan so it had that great deglazed taste.  So so so good!

WOW!!! THIS WAS AMAZING!

The only thing that I did different was use 2 (9oz) boxes of frozen spinach as opposed to the canned. Other than that, the recipe needs no changing what so ever. 
Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

I made this last night for dinner and it was absolutely awesome!  I used more mushrooms (6 oz) and next time would use fresh spinach.  It was very filling.  A light salad complimented this dish.

This was yummy!  My husband loves creamy sauce recipes, and this one sure did please.  I usually do not like cream sauces, but thought it very good.  Very heavy and filling food, though.  I cut up my chicken breast so it would be easier to serve to my children.  My 21 month old loved it.  Also, I served it with fettucine.  Definitely have a salad or lite side dish (sliced tomato) to serve with it to balance the heaviness.  A lot goes a long way.  I will definitely make this again!

This really was good!  I used frozen spinach, real bacon, and reduced fat mush soup, and all work fine.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of spinach and try milk over 1/2 & 1/2 to lighten it up a bit, but NO COMPLAINTS from anyone!  It's a keeper!

This was good except the fact that my casserole ended up to be very salty. I used grilled chicken seasoned with garlic salt (had leftovers),salted butter (didnt have unsalted) and also cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella (all I had). These my changes with bacon bites (also pretty salty) on the top made it very salty. So next time I will be really careful what I put in, definitely will reduce bacon bites (a little overhelming for me) and try to put the layer of mashed potatoes. This is a keeper even though it didnt work out very well the first time :)

Very good!  I used fresh spinach (canned=yuck!!) and seasoned it with a little garlic.  Served it with rice and a green salad-the husband loved it!

Such a great recipe!  My family loved it - even the ones who aren't spinach lovers.  I would definately use fresh spinach, and maybe reduced fat/ reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup.  (I don't like things very salty)  Didn't use the bacon bits, and didn't miss them.  There was so much flavor without them.  Yummy!

This was very good.  The only thing I would alter would be to decrease the Italian seasoning.  It was a little too strong for my liking.

Oh MY GOd! I can see why this recipe got 5 stars! It is one of the most delicious recipes I have ever eaten and it was very easy!  I used fresh baby spinach and cooked up the sliced mushrooms with my spinach.  The flavor of the sauce is to die for. My sons 21 and 20 and my husband all raved about it.  I will definately make this again. Thank you Bryan for such a delicious recipe!

Mm.  Good stuff here.  Didn't modify anything.  Might use real cooked bacon bits next time.  Also maybe just a little less spinach.  Will make this again!

This is a VERY good recipe. I followed other reviewers suggestions and it is a KEEPER. I cube & pan fry the chicken with garlic and saute the mushrooms. Use fresh brocoli. Thank you BRYAN0320.

Taste Great! I doubled and Sauted the mushrooms before I layered them onto the spinich. I also doubled the sauce and poured it over white rice. Instead of using breast I used chicken tenders(smaller cuts of chicken breasts) to cut down on cooking time. I would also cut down on the italian season by 1/4 tsp. Other than that the recipe is Fantastic!!

I loved this! My 2 year old who has never let a veggie pass his lips ate it up.  I put a rice base in the bottom of the casserole, cut the chix into bite sized pieces and left out the bacon bits as I didn't have any.  Next time I will mix the spinach into the sauce thereby tricking the 5 year old into eating it.

Excellent! This made a rookie like me look like I knew what I was doing. It was easy to make and very, very delecious. The only change I made was to use fresh spinach. Be careful not to over bake the chicken.  If you use thin pieces of chicken breast, then check after 12 to 15 minutes to see if it is pink and the juices run clear.  My wife loved this recipe!

VERY GOOD and easy !
I too 'healthied' this dish, used a little olive oil instead of butter, used evap skim milk instead of cream, only 1 C cheese on top. Kept the bacon for flavor [1/3c]
Iused a bag of baby spinach, microwaved a little and used 8 oz sliced mushrooms... not enough spinach! it disappeared. The sauce was almost too italian spiced, but I used the Emeril brand of Italian spice, maybe 1 TB of another brand would not be so powerful. Did not precook chicken, just cooked covered 30 min then uncovered and added cheese. A winner w/my husband!

This was very yummy! I used fresh spinach for this recipe.  I also fried up bacon instead of bacon bits & only used about 3 strips, crumbled.  The next time I make this, I will cube the chicken & maybe use more spices, like cracked black pepper.  I used the 98% fat-free mushroom soup.  To make it a little healthier, I am going to try yogurt instead of the half & half and use turkey bacon next time I make this recipe.

Really awesome recipe. I doubled the mushrooms (could probably even quadruple them if you really like mushrooms) and sauteed them in olive oil and fresh garlic. I also squeezed all the water out of the spinach using a sieve and a wooden spoon. I also did not put the full amount of bacon bits in as I was afraid  that it would overpower the dish. I brushed the chicken with olive oil and sprinkled it with garlic pepper, parsley flakes, basil, and seasoned salt before  it.
My boyfriend LOVED this dish and compared it to something you would get at the Olive Garden. I personally think it's way better than anything you could get there, but he loves that place, so it's all good :)

This dish was absolutely wonderful.  It could possible be the best dish I've made from this website, and I get a lot of good recipes here.  I read that other people substitued milk for the half and half to reduce calories.  Well, I did the opposite.  I only had heavy cream in the fridge and didn't want to run to the store, so heavy cream was substituted.  As I was stirring the pot, I was a little worried that the italian seasoning would take over the taste.  I was a little bummed that I had added it - but when it was cooked in, it was fabulous.  The sauce was a nice consistency and we served it over pasta.  Definitely restaurant quality.

Delicious!!  I replaced the spinach with broccoli, and left out the bacon bits.  An added plus about this recipe was the  ease in preparation.  I plan to prepare this for our next dinner guests.

I found this recipe to be too salty for my tastes. I really did not like the flavor and texture that the bacon bits added - gave it a slightly artificial taste to me. I used fresh spinach rather than canned and would definitely recommend doing that. I wasn't a big fan of the Italian seasoning either. Next time I'll modify the recipe slightly by using real bacon and fresh herbs. The recipe has great potential - just need to experiment with it a bit.

This was incredible! I only made enough for two people. I didn't have any cream of mushroom, so I used an alfredo sauce from this site instead. I served it with angel hair and garlic breadsticks. Also, my husband doesn't eat spinach, so I just layered it on one side of the casserole dish.  I also used frozen, thoroughly drained spinach.

this dish has great potential in that the flavors were wonderful, but i think the recipe needs adjustment.  first of all it came out watery, so i would start by either draining the spinach or starting with fresh spinach maybe.  by putting two cups of cheese on top, the cheese doesn't mix in so the sauce stayed a bit thin, and the cheese just browned on top.  i think if you mixed the two cups of cheese into the sauce, it would make for a better sauce as well.

will definitely try again, but making the adjustments for a better and less watery sauce.

Before I made this recipe, I made sure that I read the reviews. After reading the reviews, I put fresh baby spinach and unsalted butter and it came out bland. So next time I make this recipe, I'm putting regular salted butter instead. Pretty good recipe, you could feel yourself gaining weight!

Really good! We used cut chicken tenders to allow more of a casserole scoop than a huge piece of chicken. We also used jarred crushed garlic, and real pre-cooked bacon instead of the fake bits. Next time I'll add a little white wine to the sauce and use more mushrooms. Delicious!

This turned out to be a very good recipe.  It was very easy and quick too.  My husband loved it.  I used fresh spinach and rather than using bacon bits, I fried up some bacon and crumbled it on top.  It was really very good.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

My family LOVED this!  I did make a few changes.  I used frozen spinach thawed instead of canned (cut the sodium WAY down - didn't seem salty at all).  I cut the bacon in half - only because I didn't have enough - I will probably use the right amount next time.  I boiled the chicken and broke into bite size pieces so it would be easier for the little ones to eat.  I always ask my family to rate things on a 5 point scale and my 7 year old son said it was a 10 anyway!

My BF and I really liked this dish. I followed suggestions of sautéing the fresh spinach and mushrooms but added sliced red onion too. Put the mixture in the bottom of a dish, browned (two)boneless chicken thighs and put them on top of the spinach, followed by the sauce. Baked for twenty minutes then added a tilapia fillet to my side of the dish, with more sauce for it. I didn't put any cheese on top out of preference.  Thank you!

I used fresh spinach instead of canned. I added it to the mixture so it would be wilted and soft. I didn’t add bacon. It doesn’t need it. It was delicious and even my picky eaters loved it. I put it over fettuccine

I am normally not a fan of spinach or mushrooms, but my wife who has different tastes. And holy wow was this amazing. I put in an extra can of cream of mushrooms with roasted garlic and the taste was so rich and creamy. The spinach and mushrooms added some really great flavor and were not overwhelming as I thought they would be.

Delicious. My husband absolutely loved this dish.  I did leave out the Italian seasoning and exchange the cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken.

Sorry, I can't rate this "as written". We do not care for white meat anything,  so I used thighs. Like others, I used fresh spinach and sauteed with mushrooms and gave the chicken thighs a sear in the grease from frying up real bacon. We enjoyed the end result. I took off 1 star because I didn't make the actual recipe

The recipe was flavorful and simple to make. I have made it with bok choy and peppers and changed the cheese on occasion for a slight variance. it has been a hit every time I've made it!.

I cooked up a large container of baby spinach in a little butter and then drained well. I also cooked up two containers of sliced baby bells mushrooms in a little butter and drained. Placed the spinach in the bottom of the baking dish, then mushrooms and the raw chicken on top. I covered with sauce and real bacon bits. Cooked at 350 until almost done and then put the mozzarella and popped back in the oven.

I cut up and fried my own applewood smoked bacon, set aside, chopped a whole bag of fresh spinach, sauteed in a little of the bacon drippings and then followed the recipe except used rotisserie chicken breasts shredded in chunks instead of cooking chicken breasts. This was so good! The mushrooms I used were baby bellas.  My favorite part was the mozzarella that got crispy on top. Will definitely make it again!

I put this together in the morning, skipping step 1 to keep the chicken moist. I was in the middle of stripping wallpaper in my kitchen, so I needed something I could just throw in the oven when suppertime came and I was too tired to cook. I put it all together and stuck it in the fridge. Was a little worried about the raw chicken touching the warm cheese/garlic mixture, but it came out fine. My family ate it and we're all still alive the next morning! :) It was amazing! Will definitely make again.

I made Chicken Florentine, following some of the modifications others suggested, and added some of my own. First, I used leftover rotisserie chicken breasts and cut them up into bite sized pieces. I sautèed the  mushrooms in 2 tbsp butter (not 1/4 cup!) along with half an onion, minced, and I added the minced garlic just before adding the mushroom soup. I added 2% milk to the soup rather than half and half. I cooked the fresh spinach (not canned-yuck!) in the microwave and added it to the sauce along with the chunks of chicken. I could see that the sauce, vegetables and chicken were going to make a small amount for dinner, so I cooked about 4 ounces of farfalle pasta and mixed the cooked pasta with the sauce mixture. I sprayed an 8 x 8 inch pan with cooking spray and put the sauce/pasta/chicken/spinach mixture into it.  I sprinkled shredded 3-cheese Italian cheese and bacon bits over the mixture and baked it for 25 minutes at 350ºF. My husband and I rated this dish as a keeper!

1)I used 1 bag cooking spinach, sauteed with one giant pack mushrooms in butter.  poured in white wine and used salt, pepper, garlic.

2) I diced the chicken (5 breasts) roughly in big chunks and then pan fried it a bit (not fully cooked but the outside ready).  **next time dice it up smaller - 2cm x 2cm instead of 1 inch by 1.5 etc

3) don't be shy with the sauce, it's excellent.  double up next time, cause dang.

4) plan to serve with garlic toasted bread, and maybe toss in asparagus tips for freshness?  consider a bed of spaghetti to serve with/over.  Maybe zoodles.  The fresh would be a pleasant contrast to the heaviness of the baked dish

Apr 2019 - I found this recipe when trying to make dinner out of what I had on hand - minus the mushrooms and cream of ?? soup - so I whipped up my own "cream of" soup recipe from Google, sautéed the spinach, sliced up the chicken and it all came together deliciously!  I halved the recipe and there was plenty, even too much? sauce but it was delicious.

Fantastic recipe. I altered it only in that I lightly browned the chicken in the skillet for a couple of minutes on each side, prior to placing in oven with the sauce. Really need to be careful not to let chicken dry out. Even better with boneless thigh meat!

AMAZING!!!! Will definitely make again and again. So simple ....but wonderful! All I did differently was saute my own spinach and mushrooms and double the amount of each. I also added salt, pepper, and garlic to when cooking the chicken.

Excellent recipe.  The only change I made was  to use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom because my husband does not like cream of mushroom.  I used fresh baby spinach and the mushrooms and seasoned the layer o vegetables with salt and pepper before adding the sauce.  It was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again.

This is a fabulous 5 star recipe when making the alterations suggested by the "most helpful reviews", so the recipe as written gets 4 stars.  Browning the chicken in a skillet (rather than baking it) gives it so much more flavor as well as preventing the chicken from being overcooked.   Due to personal preference, I used fresh spinach, freshly fried bacon, and omitted the mushrooms.  Doing this provided an absolutely scrumptious entree.  TIP: if not serving over pasta or rice, I suggest having some warm, crusty bread to sop up the sauce.  It's just so tasty you'll want to eat every drop.  It was loved by all, so I will be making this again!

Fantastic recipe!  I used fresh spinach (uncooked prior to assembly), real crumbled bacon (about 4-6 slices), and a combination of shredded mozzarella and slices of provolone to top it (I didn't have enough mozarella).  Otherwise, I followed cooking instructions as stated and it was SO Delicious!  I served it over noodles for my kids and over zoodles for my husband and I.  I was asked to make it again, soon!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family loved it. I make bacon in the oven so I baked the chicken on the same baking sheet. I did not have canned spinach so I used frozen.  The meal was easy to prepare and everyone really enjoyed it.

Yummy! Our family loves Alfredo sauce, so I doubled it. I also cooked the chicken the same way some people have suggested, by not baking first to avoid drying out the chicken, so I baked it a little longer to make sure it was cooked all the way through. Thank you!

Tried making this tonight.  Delicious!.  My husband and my 10-year-old grandson liked it, too!  I improvised a little due to not having as much mozzarella on hand as it called for ( had about a cup).  I also used fresh spinach and accidentally tripled the garlic (Used 3 TBS instead of 3 tsp), but it still came out fine.  My husband said I could make this any time;  he really loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly and even though the casserole looked great I was very disappointed in flavor. The sauce was too rich and the cream of mushroom soup, Italian seasoning and the parmesan cheese seemed to be too overpowering for my taste. Thankfully my mother thought it tasted ok and took it to her church potluck the next day and served it with pasta. Personally won't make this again though.

Add sun-dried tomatoes when you add the mozzarella for a nice texture change and bites of sweetness.

I liked this, I didn't love it.  I did follow the other recommendation and only cooked the chicken once.  It does produce more liquid as a result but nothing too difficult to manage.  I think the bacon is unnecessary the flavor of the sauce provides enough flavor without the bacon.  I did use more of the seasoning than what it called for because I like those flavors.  I also only used one cup of mozzarella on top.  Although it does finish off the look of the meal, it also may not be completely necessary as the sauce is so rich.  I served in on a baked potato, but that wasn't really necessary either.

This was ok. I did follow recommendations to saute the spinach, mushroom, onion (which I added) and garlic in butter. Spread across the bottom of casserole dish and added the uncooked chicken on top. Sprinkled with more garlic, onion, bacon, the creamy sauce and some mozzarella at the end. Cooked it about 45 min. The chicken was just too big and chunky. I think next time I'll cut into smaller pieces. Also, there was too much "juice" from the spinach (maybe because I used frozen). It didn't blend well with the cream sauce mixture at the end. Maybe next time I'll use canned or try and drain/dry it better. The flavor, however, was really good (we just had to keep stirring/blending it). I also might add more than 3-4 strips bacon next time. I forgot to add white wine, so I might try that next time too. It's a keeper, just needs some tweaking.

I used the recipe as a baseline, but tried to simplify the cooking method. All the ingredients were the same, but I sauteed the chicken in an oven-proof dish, then put them on a plate while I made the sauce. Then I put the chicken back in the dish and finished it in the oven, topped with bacon.  My family loved it. I also used about 2 cups of fresh spinach instead of canned.

Meh. I don't know what I did wrong but the taste was bland to me and my husband, although it did look pretty. I used fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms, and real crumbled bacon, but I would expect fresh ingredients to make something better. If they don't, then I'm not sure I should be liking it anyhow.

I really enjoyed this.  However, next time I will season the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder prior to baking. I also sauteed some fresh spinach I had on hand and used real bacon instead of bits, sauteing the mushrooms and spinach in the bacon fat for flavor. Will consider cooking some pasta as an addition. Also, the cheese got too burnt and will add at last 10 minutes of cooking.

Excellent recipe. I used to have this dish at a local restaurant many moons ago. They were around a long time and this was my favorite dish. After they relocated far away, I couldn't find a restaurant or recipe that even came close. This recipe is IT. It is perfect as-is. But you can't go wrong adding sun-dried tomatoes along with the bacon bits and serving it with a side of heavy garlic mashed potatoes.  MAKE IT

This one passed the husband test and he said he would eat it again.  This is good and different.   With all the different flavors in it, it makes it very tasty.   I used fresh spinach and sauted it to wilt it.  I used fresh bacon that I sauteed and crumbled and then put the garlic int he bacon grease for a couple minutes and then drained it and put it in the sauce.  I did not use the butter.

The canned spinach tanked the recipe. The chicken and additional ingredients/sauce were delicious however next time I would substitute the spinach for broccoli or another vegetable that was more fresh and didn't leave the dish tasting so blah.

Used a store-bought rotisserie chicken for really fast prep and moist chicken.  I used cheddar instead of mozz cheese and italian breadcrumbs instead of bacon on top.  Easy and delicious!

I didn't have some of the ingredients so here are my substitutions: white sauce for cream of mushroom soup, so doubled the parmesan cheese but didn't add mozzarella.  Used sundried tomatoes instead of bacon.  Used sliced baby bella mushrooms.  And fresh spinach.  Got rave reviews from the fam!  I want to try it with white fish too.

I followed previous advice and cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and sauteed it in garlic first. My husband said it was better than any meal he's had at Olive Garden! It's his new favorite dish.

Fanastic.  I used about 14 ounces of spinach and about 20 ounces of cubed chicken that I sautéed.  But, a pound of cubed   Chicken would work also.  I used fresh grated Parmesan. I also used fresh garlic. I followed the recipe exactly  
I   Fried bacon,   (  1/2 pound) set aside,  wiped out the pan and put a little butter in it and cooked the chicken cubes till just done.   Still juicy, about five minutes. Don't over cook. Then I sautéed the mushroom , added the spinach without water and cooked till the spinach was completely wilted.   Put in the 9 x 13 and poured half of the sauce over it , chicken and more sauce, ( as instructed) , then the bacon and mozzarella,  I only used one cup of mozzarella.  That was enough.  This is definitely our favorite, can't wait for the leftovers.sounds like a lot of work, but it isn’t.   The first time always takes longest. I served it over bow tie pasta.

DELICIOUS! I followed the recommendations by “vicsgarden”. I used an entire container of sliced mushrooms and a bag of baby spinach. I used whole milk and juice from a whole lemon, about 2 tablespoons. Next time I will use less Italian seasoning, maybe a teaspoon. Husband and child loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this turned out well. After the initial prep I refrigerated the dish for the next evening. I also used fresh spinach which made the sauce a little thinner. I will thicken it more next time. I will make it again.

Great recipe! I would recommend cooking the spinach and mushrooms to give it flavor before putting it all together with the sauce. Other than that I loved it!

This was really good but it was a to runny.  I suppose a little less half and half may help with that.  I did use fresh spinach for sure, yummy.  Very good but will probably try less liquid next go round.  Husband and son did quite enjoy tho!

Excellent recipe.  Used the ingredients as listed.  Browned the chicken breasts cut in half on the stovetop instead of baking them first.  Then, prepared according to the remainder of the recipe in accordance with the directions.

5 star. When prebaking the chicken only cook it 20 min max because then it gets baked again and you don’t want it too dry. I also liked it better when i doubled the cream sauce. This way you can put the chicken and sauce on top of some rice pilaf!

I took the suggestions made in one of the comments and skipped the first step of baking the chicken in the oven, and just layered the raw chicken into the casserole container. The biggest issue I had was that the dish was way too saucy. It was much less like a casserole and more like I was fishing for pieces of chicken. If I make this in the future, I think I will cut down on the sauce and cut the pieces of chicken much smaller which will hopefully make it more casserole-like.

However, although the consistency was off, it tasted pretty darn good :)

Absolutely delicious, I felt like I was eating at a 5 star restaurant. One thing that I did was use the bacon grease over the chicken breasts to give it a bit more flavor. I will definitely be making this again soon!

I was so excited to try this .... it smelled so good cooking.  I don't know what happened!  It was so bland, it was not creamy at all, like I thought it would be.  My husband hasn't tried it yet & I am afraid to feed it to him.

Thank you for this recipe!  It is fantastic.  Used frozen spinach and cut raw boneless chicken into small pieces (skipped first step as others advised).     Served over penne pasta with complement of garlic toast.   So easy and so delicious!

This is a delicious dish but the casserole picture you have posted when you open up the recipe is not the right picture for this dish and is misleading.  The one with the bacon sprinkled on top that is returned when you search for Chicken Florentine is the correct dish.  Still, great dish.  I make it regularly for my family.

I made adjustments similar to other reviews; I cut recipe in 1/2 and did NOT cook the chicken first. Saute fresh baby spinach and mushrooms & put in casserole dish. Topped with uncooked chicken and sauce.  Cooked at 350 for about 35 minutes total. I think next time I will try without the addition of the mozzarella cheese  - I don't think it's needed

Vicsgarden had the right idea by skipping first step and baking for a longer time at 350 vs 400. It came out perfect!

The sauce on this is YUMMY! My husband and I thought it was too much spinach as written, and we didn't love the canned spinach. We will try fresh or frozen next time. We like it with the sauce over rice. I cooked some bacon rather than using bacon bits, and that was worth the extra effort. We will try this again.

Sorry, but we didn't care for this recipe.  It was way too soupy and was missing something, not quite sure what.  I didn't use as much of the Italian seasoning as called for as suggested by the other makers of this dish.  I also used fresh spinach instead of canned. Other than that I did everything the recipe said to do.  I can't believe I am saying this because I ALWAYS want extra cheese on everything, but I think this 2 1/2 C of cheese is just too much cheese for this dish.  I won't be making this again.

NORMALLY for the first time I make every recipe  EXACT before I tweek it. But this time I only had fresh spinach instead of canned (I prefer fresh) and heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. And it turned out AH-MAZING. It was rich and tasted like a restaurant. I baked the boneless chicken breast for 20 min and took them out to rest while i made the sauce. And then finished baking another 20 min with sauce and spinach and mushrooms. Definately will make again and again and again!!!! The chicken was fork moist!!

I used split 6 chicken breast pieces instead of whole and added adobo seasoning and parsley instead of Italian. This dish turned out great! Paired it with some cheese tortellini and Alfredo sauce and it filled up my hungry hungry husband!

Loved it and love this site!!! I just did as some others suggested and skipped cooking chicken first. I also left out adding mushrooms(since not a big fan of them) but still used cream of mushroom soup(the low sodium Campbell's brand). My picky 9 year old even loved it.  Will absolutely make again and again

I loved this after i did it my way, I followed all the ingredients on the recipe the only thing i did differently was use the stove top instead off the oven, I cooked my chicken breast until lightly browned, then added all the other ingredients and cooked until mushrooms were tender the turned the heat to low and topped it with cheese and crumbled bacon, It was great very flavorful and moist. I find that the oven dries the chicken out to much. and this way its all done in about 20 minutes.

Good but way too rich. I made some of the recommended changes but just too cheesy. Maybe less cheese and more milk to make the sauce saucier. Not sure. Great flavor though. I used a box of fresh spinach but could have used more. The thought of canned spinach just did not sound good at all. I also cut up the chicken but I think whole breasts would be better too. Just my thoughts......

The recipe  turned out great with the suggested changes. I sauteed fresh mushrooms and spinach  in butter . I did not precook the chicken.  I cut the chicken breast in half . I added the sauce on bottom and top. I then added about three cups of cheese. I cooked the dish on 350 uncovered for about 45 minutes.  It turned out tender and delicious.

I used fresh spinach; next time I make it I will use real bacon.  Also, I cut the chicken breasts into strips and served over garlic parsley fettucine.  Delicious.

I'm giving this a 5 even though I had no choice but to make my own cream of soup, which takes 10 min. tops (watching my blood pressure).  It really was delicious.

Excellent. I cooked chicken in olive oil in skillet while making sauce rather than baking.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Restaurant quality.  Served with asparagus.  Will definitely make again.

Would definitely make again. I did sear the chicken in a skillet first, and that added a lot. Also used white wine rather than lemon juice because it was what I had. Fresh herbs would be even better! Wish I could figure out a way to make the pasta with it.

Loved this.  I pared it down a little.  10 oz frozen spinach (thawed); 8 oz sliced mushrooms; 18 oz roasted chicken breast strips (cut into 1" pieces).  I used an 8 x 8 deep glass baking dish. Worked out just fine, and tasted GREAT!

Great. Cooked bacon. Used grease to sauce spinach, shrooms. Put in bottom of casserole dish. Cut up 2 1/2 lbs of chicken and cooked in the same pan. Put that on top of spinach and shrooms, made sauce in same pan. Used 1%milk,   2 tsp italian seas., rest same. Poured over chicken and topped with bacon bits & 1 c. of cheese. Baked 400 deg 25min. Served over spaghetti squash. A bit salty. Try low sodium mushroom soup next time. Next time:nTried it with broccoli florets. Wonderful.

This came out great. I didn’t have spinach so I made my base with zucchini noodles. Also, I didn’t pre-bake the chicken. I’ll definitely make this again!

Excellent! I skip baking the chicken first but I do lightly sauté it for a minute on each side to make sure it cooks and to not dry it out.  Also I bake it at 350 for 30 minutes and then add the cheese.

Amazing dish, very tasty and easy to make.  I personally don't like canned spinach so instead I substituted frozen spinach (heated according to the instructions) and that worked out great.  I would also HIGHLY recommend serving this dish over mashed potatoes as the sauce doubles as a gravy!

This was  a good  start for the recipe, but it needs  a little added flavor.  I saute onions in with my spinach.  I cooked and crumbled real bacon  as it will always give  you more flavor.  I cut the chicken in pieces and saute in a pan, as putting it in the oven prior is sure to dry out the chicken.  Also added more cheese  as you can never have too much cheese!

I followed the recipe exactly but instead I used frozen chicken and frozen chopped spinach. I added the chopped spinach to the cheesy soup mixture and it worked better than having large chunks of spinach in the bottom of my dish. Overall a great tasting dish, and easy to make on a budget. I will definitely be making it again!

Delicious! I think it may be even better if using frozen chopped spinach (cooked) instead of the canned.

made it ad low calorie as I could and it still tasted very good.  I used half the butter, fat free half and half, half the parmesan cheese, a sprinkle of bacon bits, and probably half the mozzarella.

Doubled the recipe to make in a 9 x13 pan and also fileted the breasts as they were very thick.  Will use a little less spinach next time, but overall a very tasty main course.  Made it when family came for lunch and had a bit leftover after feeding 8.

AWESOME!!!!! Did make a few changes after reading reviews.
Cut chicken in halves (thick breasts), seared, then set aside. In same skillet, sautéed portabella mushrooms in butter. When almost tender, added 2 bags of baby spinach and sautéed   till wilted. After draining extra liquid, put on bottom of dish, sprinkled crushed red pepper over . Then in same skillet, made sauce   as directed. Served over fettuccini . Did not use bacon (vegetarian in family). Definitely will make again!!!!!!~

I love this dish, and have made it several times. I disagree with those who don't pre-bake the chicken as instructed. I think this is a for food-safety reasons. I definitely would not cook this dish with raw chicken.  Also, I use 2 boxes of frozen spinach,  defrosted and well-drained. Also, I prefer to use two large chicken breasts, cut in half, as there is more of the delicious sauce per serving.  I only serve two people.

Agreed with other comments about not baking chicken. I sautéed 1 oz mushrooms and 5oz fresh spinach with butter then added 1 clove minced garlic for another minute, scooped into into baking (8x11) dish and added lemon juice (stirred in). Placed raw chicken (4 breasts cut in half long ways).  In a bowl I stirred together soup, Parmesan cheese, whole milk, and Italian seasoning and then scooped on top of chicken. Sprinkled the bacon bits and covered with the mozzarella cheese. It probably baked for 45 mins before done. Tasted awesome!

This is a new favorite in my house.  I used the suggestions in the reviews Ike not precooking my chicken which kept it nice and juicy. I also added a little bit of sour cream .     I doubled the sauce and served it over rice.

WOW!!! Excellent with the previous reviewers changes plus a few of my own- I fried 4 pieces of bacon in a skillet, removed the bacon then added 1/2 stick butter to the bacon grease,  1 1/2 pounds baby portabella mushrooms (I LOVE mushrooms) sliced into 3rd's,  a bag of fresh spinach, 1 chopped onion and 5 cloves sliced garlic. Sauteed down for a few minutes then put into a Pam sprayed 13x9 baking dish. I left the liquid behind in the pan. I chopped 4 raw boneless skinless chicken breasts into bite size pieces, put these on top of the mushroom spinach mixture. Then 1 put 1 family size can of cream of mushroom soup into the pan along with the mushroom liquid that the mushroom and spinach had come out of,  added 1/2 cup half and half, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. Italian seasoning, and 1 cup mozzarella cheese (didn't have any parmesan). I warmed this until the cheese was melted and everything was mixed. I poured this over the chicken. I sprinkled the bacon pieces over the top and baked for 25 minutes uncovered at 350 degrees. Then I added another cup of mozzarella cheese over the top and baked 15 more minutes at 350. I served it over fettucini. Will make this again! Good enough for company! Delicious!!

It was easy and delicious! It was very rich and definitely not for any dieters out there! I made it and put over rice. It would be great over pasta as well . I cut up the chicken into chunks instead of whole breast and made a bit more sauce so it was enough for the addition of the rice. Would definitely make  again.

Very good.  I changed a few thngs also. I cut my chicken breasts in half through the middle so they where filleted and pan fried them.  I also substituted 1 tsp dried basil for the itallion seasoning and a 10 oz bag of frozen spinach for the canned and didn't add the lemon juice.  I added cream of chicken soup instead of  mushroom and used swiss instead of mozzerella so I didn't include the parmesan. I also used real bacon instead of imitation bacon bits. My spinach was still a little frozen so I cooked it 10 minutes extra.  It was a big hit with the family!

I try to crowd-source the best suggestions on recipe alterations. Halved the Italian seasoning; could have used more. Milk 1% instead of half-and-half; plenty rich enough. Fresh baby spinach, about three leaves deep; should be a bit more as spinach tends to vanish. Cremini mushrooms worked well. Cut four strips of bacon across width into quarter-inch pieces and fried until crispy; spread on top. Baked uncovered; still liquid enough to pour on top of noodles, though we had it straight up. Three thumbs up at dinner last night; just finished for today's lunch. Good thing I made two!

This was delicious! I left out the mushrooms, and substituted the cream of mushroom for cream of chicken (my husband is allergic), and used fresh spinach that I sauteed with some fresh garlic and chopped onions. We added rice so avoid using more dishes. Turned out great! Thanks will be making this again.

I would make this again, but next time I will use real bacon - the fake bacon bit flavor overwhelmed the dish.

After reading a number of the reviews for this recipe, I decided to give it a try.  Like many others, I changed this up quite a bit.  Here’s what I did.  I made about half the recipe, using a splash of white wine for the lemon juice, half a can of the mushroom soup, freezing the other half, only ½ t. of Italian seasoning, milk for the half and half, and a 10 oz. box of frozen chopped spinach.  I totally skipped the bacon bits, and cut the mozzarella in half.  I cooked the spinach according to the package, cooled it, and squeezed out the excess liquid.  I put that in the bottom of a 9x9 casserole.  I sautéed the mushrooms and put them on top of the spinach.  I wanted the chicken to have some color, so I browned one side only and put it on top of the mushrooms.  I made the sauce pretty much as written, using the white wine I mentioned, and I put the mozzarella cheese in the sauce instead of on top of the casserole.  I spooned the sauce over the chicken, covered and refrigerated this until I was ready to pop it in the oven.  I left it covered and baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes.  When I was making the sauce I thought it was too thick, but after it baked it seemed fine.  We liked this combination very much, but if I make it again, I’d like to try a more flavorful cheese like Swiss.

Yum!  I followed another reviewers advice and sauteed the mushrooms and spinach first, placed the chicken breast on top, followed by the sauce.  Topped with bacon and mozzarella -served over rice - everyone raved!

Overall good recipe.  I tried to make it as close as possible to recipe as posted. It was good but to me it was a little bland but that is only my taste. If you like  a more distinct taste  you might want to adjust seasoning a little but I would suggest trying it as written the first time. It might be perfect for your taste.

I followed the suggested directions from other reviews. It was okay, but I thought it needed more salt. And, for some reason, mine was kind of soupy. My husband liked it a lot. Probably not something I will make too often.

SO GOOD!  As some other users recommended, I sautéed fresh spinach with mushrooms rather than using canned. Also used leftover grilled chicken breast that I chopped in cubes (no need for a knife then when eating). Followed everything else as written. So so so good!!! I served this over linguine. This is now on my favorites list, and I KNOW this is something I will be craving in the future. Do yourself a favor and make this now!

Took some tips from other reviews. Started by cooking bacon extra crisp put to the side. In same flavored pan, sautéed little garlic, mushrooms, spinach w some white wine salt and pepper. Layered that in dish. In same pan, made the sauce by recipe. Followed tip and cooked the chicken in the casserole. Came out moist. This could have gotten 4 stars but the sauce was a little underwhelming... Found it curious that the recipe didn't call for any seasoning? Might try same concept again with more of an Alfredo sauce..

Very good I think next time I might mix the spinach in with the sauce and maybe a little less spinach. Then maybe my kids won't avoid the spinach as much.

Instead of baking chicken for 20 min, sear each side on high heat in olive oil, making sure to keep the middle pink.  This locked in the juices; it was so moist, I didn't even need a knife to cut the chicken.  After layering spinach, sauce, chicken, and cheese, bake in oven at 350 for 20-25 min.

This is really tasty. Rich and creamy. I used fresh English spinach, and cut and sauteed the chicken breasts first (instead of baking) like other reviewers suggested. I would have preferred the dish to have turned out a little less runny though. But perhaps it'll thicken on standing a bit. We'll definitely be dishing up seconds later. I served it with buttery green beans.

Love this recipe! It's in regular rotation at our house. The flavors are wonderful! The only changes I've made are to use fresh spinach and add onion to the veggies when sauteing. Also, I use real bacon & I cut the chicken into bite size pieces, sauteing them after I complete the vegetables.

Absolutely delicious!!!!!! When my husband likes what I cook I know it's good. And when I hear myself say, " mmm, I like that" (because I am critical of my own cooking), I know that it is delicious!!!

I just made this and I must say "YUM". I didn't have any soup so I made my own mushroom sauce. I know it will be great with the soup too. Did the rest like the recipe. Will be making often. Thanks!

Made with just a couple of changes.  
Cooked the chicken on stove and I sauted onions and mushrooms before adding to the casserole.
Darn....forgot the bacon bits.
Got rave reviews.  I won't forget the bacon next time.

Although I sauteed the chicken rather than baking, the recipe was fantastic.  A definite keeper and perfect for serving to guests.

The hubby gave this two thumbs up.  I sauteed the spinach and mushrooms, then put them in the bottom of the casserole dish.   Next I added bite sized (raw) pieces of chicken.  I poured the sauce on top, then added the bacon bits.  25 minutes in a 350 degree oven, then topped with mozzarella and baked an additional 10 minutes.  Yum!  The sauce was a little thin, so next time I think I'll add the soup without milk or cream.

I'm not entirely sure what happened. It was dreadfully awful. I couldn't stomach through my plate. It tasted of bland chicken breast, grease, wilted spinach and way too much italian seasoning. Incredibly disappointing.

A favorite at our house, but with a few changes. As mentioned by others, I use 10 oz of fresh, steamed spinach. I also double the "sauce" portion of the recipe, so that it pairs nicely with pasta.

This dish was fabulous! I only made a couple of minor changes. First, I used a half cup of butter instead of a quarter cup. Then, when I baked the chicken I sprinkled it with salt, pepper, olive oil, and the Italian seasoning. Last, I used fresh spinach and laid it in the bottom of a buttered casserole. My husband said this was his favorite dish ever! Of course, he just loves to eat so I don't know how reliable that was. But it was really really really really good!

Great dish! Full of flavor. The family loved it. Pan seared the chicken in a cast iron skillet first. Fresh baby Bella mushrooms and fresh spinach made it a well rounded meal.

Great recipe. I modified it for a slow cooker. I mixed the mushroom soup, garlic, milk (instead of half and half) lemon juice, italian seasoning with chicken breast (cut into bite-sized pieces. Cooked for 3 hours on low. Added a bunch of fresh spinach, parmesean cheese, mixed and continued to cook for 1 hr. Added fresh, cleaned diced mushrooms in the last 20 minutes. Cooked some angel hair pasta, drained  and mixed with the chicken mixture. Topped with pre-cooked crumbled bacon.  The family love it. It is a keeper.
Omitted the butter. .  . not necessary here.

I've made this before and my husband cried each time. This time I boiled the chicken until it was just done (8mins for thin breasts), then let it simmer on a low heat in the finished sauce for about 15-20 mins.

Loved the dish. I made a few changes. I could not use the mushrooms (I have someone that can not eat them). I used a can of cream of chicken, heavy cream,  and 1/2 the mozzarella cheese. I also added a little of the chicken juices to the mix. Everyone loved it.

Chicken breast halves were quartered and was still more than enough for 6 people and several days of leftovers. VERY filling, but a crowd pleaser. I cut the breast halves in half again for baking and in half again for serving.

Didn't love it.  Made it pretty much as described.  Did sauté the spinach (no mushrooms since I had none) in a bit of butter, then added a bit of white wine and a clove of minced garlic to the spinach after it was quite wilted and continued sautéing another minute or two as suggested by another reviewer.   I placed this at the bottom of my pan.    Used cream of chicken soup since I had no cream of mushroom soup on hand in "white" layer, then mixed in my chicken.  These changes didn't stray much from the original recipe, so I don't think they were the reason I didn't much like this dish.  It just needed something else....perhaps rice or pasta.  The reason I chose this recipe was because it didn'include those ingredients and I am always looking for low carb recipes to serve my diabetic husband.   I'm not saving this one to my recipe box.

This was very good.  I did use fresh spinach and sautéed those and the mushrooms in the fat from cooking the bacon bits.  I also skipped the 1st step, and placed the chicken raw on the layer of the spinach & mushrooms.  This was suggested by a another review.

I have already done it twice, and I have loved it each time. I have skipped the first step which is bake the chicken first and went right away to sautéing the mushroom and spinach with butter. Then I put that in a oven pan on the bottom and spread them there. After that I put the raw chicken on the mixture and I poured the sauce on top of it. Preheat the oven at 350-400. Put the pan in the oven at 350 for 25-30 mins depending on your preference. Take it out, put the mozzarella cheese on it and give it another 10-15 mins in the oven at 350. Take it out and enjoy the goodness!!

This is my first review and it is because myself and my entire family LOVED this recipe. I did use fresh spinach that I cooked down with garlic and  I cut the chicken into pieces and sautéed that with garlic powder and it was delicious! I can't wait to make this again! Thank you for the recipe!

Made with the revisions suggested by Vic's Garden. Unfortunately, I forgot to get fresh garlic and mozzarella, so I used 1 tsp. Garlic powder in place of the minced garlic and just enough shredded Parmesan and shredded smoked Gouda to cover the top of the casserole.  My family enjoyed it.

I really liked this.  The kids weren't so convinced, but they did eat it.  The only changes I made were I used fresh spinach, fried normal bacon and I made the roux from scratch as I didn't have cream of mushroom soup.  Fantastic!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made just a couple minor adjustment. I browned the chicken in a cast iron pan, set it a side and sautéed fresh spinach.  When the spinach was complete, I used a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan, then added it to the sauce. Layered per instruction, but sliced the chicken breast before putting in, so it would be easier to serve when done.

This received rave reviews from my husband and 10 year old daughter? I didn't have any bacon bits, but it was still worth 5 stars!  Husband says to make it again.

Tonight will be the second time I make this dish as the first time was a big hit. I followed the advice of others and cooked chicken (cut into chunks) in the pan first. Also I cooked pasta and added it to the soup mixture and used fresh spinach. Hope it's as good the second time around!

My family enjoyed this dish. I'll make it again.  I used a mix of boneless skinless  chicken thighs & large chunks of chicken breast. I browned the chicken in a bit of bacon fat and olive oil and salted whIle browning.  I removed the chicken and sauted  diced onion.  I added the garlic, wilted fresh spinach, and portobella mushooms, I also used Campbell's cream of mushroom with roasted  garlic.  I used regular milk instead of half and half and . Excellent dish. Highly recommended.

Have made this several times. Followed other reviews and sauted the spinach and mushrooms with garlic, place int he bottom of the casserole dish and placed raw chicken on top covered by sauce.  Used 5 cheese Italian. So easy, so tasty.

I served this over linguine, here are the changes I made I first crisped up 1/2 lb of bacon removed it from the pan and then sauted the bite sized chicken peices in the  bacon grease, and then assembled as the recipe stated, I used cheddar cheese, canned mushrooms and frozen spinich because it was on hand. delicious and easy.

I made this with turkey and minced sundried tomatoes (in place of bacon bits) and it was delicious... except for the over-mushroom-ness of the sauce. The sauce would probably benefit from replacing the can of cream of mushroom soup with cream of potato soup, cream of chicken soup, or even alfredo sauce. Just something  to mellow out the dish a bit. The lemon juice also made no difference in taste. But overall, a pretty good recipe.

My family loved this! Easy to follow, not too much prep, and quality dish all at the same time. I used a whole package of fresh spinach that I sautéed in olive oil instead of using the canned spinach. I also used slices of cooked turkey bacon on top instead of the bits.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was VERY good. My version involved making my own white sauce  made with milk for the soup, fresh spinach and browning the chicken first then finishing it in the oven in the casserole.  I meant to get mozz but forgot it. Just used some shaved parm we had and it was very good.

Gave it 4 stars because if I hadn't changed cooking time it would've burned it & used way to many dishes. I baked the chicken in a 9x9 pan for 20 min & even though they were thick chicken breasts they were almost done. If using thinner ones watch the cooking time. 2nd I used fresh spinach not the canned. 3rd I used bacon cooked over bacon bites. That was just a personal preference again. 4th I didn't return to the oven on 400 like instructions but back to the 350 & it only needed an additional 10 min. This is a good basic recipe, but watch the cooking time & oven temp or nothing you do will help the outcome.

I read the other reviewers comment about pre-cooking the chicken being unnecessary, which sounded right to me. So I layered the spinach, mushrooms, chicken and sauce, and since my chicken breasts were huge (seriously, I could only fit three in the pan) baked it at 350 for 35 minutes, topped with crumbled bacon and mozzarella, and baked for another 10. My husband, who dislikes cooked spinach, loved it and wants me to make it again soon. Next time I will use a larger pan, as it barely fit in my 9x9, and I will adjust the times to cook for 15 minutes with the mozzarella, since I prefer slightly browned cheese. I may also slice the breasts into smaller pieces if they're as big as these were, or maybe just use chicken tenderloins.

This was very good  I did just cut up the chicken raw and put on top of spinach and mushrooms then poured sauce on top of everything, baked it uncovered also cooked fresh spinach and mushrooms in a little butter first.  This is a keeper

Used fresh bacon for half of the bacon. Used 1 1/2 bags of fresh spinach. Cooked the spinach and mushrooms in half the bacon grease. Cubed the chicken, seasoned with Adobo by Goya and sautéed in other half bacon grease. My husband doesn't care for Italian seasoning so only used 1t. Didn't  have enough mozzarella so supplemented the other cup with the fresh grated Parmesan.  Everything else the same.

I used chicken thighs instead of breast and skipped the first step as other reviews stated.  Added lots of spinach, kale , arugula and mushrooms.  Served it over rice with your Brussels spouts, cranberry and hazelnut recipe.   It was really good.

This recipe has very little flavor and I did skip the first step which in turn made the chicken quite juicy.  The chicken was flavorless nonetheless. I would season the chicken next time with at least salt and pepper.

This was delicious! Instead of having a side dish of pasta or potatoes, I cooked 1/3 box of penne and added it to the sauce mixture before layering the ingredients into the casserole as directed in the recipe. I added a little additional half and half to keep the casserole from getting to dry in the oven. I also used real diced bacon that I had cooked previously and had in the freezer.

It was moist , but a little too rich for me. Next time I'll try 1 can of spinache, 1 tsp garlic, 3 tbl butter, 1 c of mozzarella, 3 tbl butter ad 1/2 c bacon.
I put this in a 9x12 casserole dish.

Using canned spinach...BAD idea! Did use another reviewer's idea and baked the chicken in the dish instead of cooking ahead of time. Chicken was still nice and moist. Have a few ideas that I am going to add next time around.

I made it. It tasted great. I followed others' suggestions.  I used fresh spinach and sautéed it in butter. I put some sauce on the bottom and the rest on the top of the chicken. I baked it a lottle over a half hour. Goes great with pasta noodles or rice.

Delicious Sauce!! Will definitely try with Shrimp and Fish next and will probably double up and put one in the freezer to save! Super easy to put together in no time. I used chicken tenderloin strips and baked on convection 350 for about 45 minutes. Turned out great! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Listened to other reviewers and sauted fresh spinach, mushrooms separately, browned the chicken, cooked a few pieces of bacon, etc.  I thought I had mushroom soup but it was cream of chicken and it was still delicious. Also used fontina cheese instead, yum! Will make again.

This turned out great! I served it over angel hair pasta. Next time, I will add more spinach and lemon juice. I used fresh mushrooms & spinach.

A good recipe, with the potential to become a regular.  I anticipated that it would be too rich, so I diluted the sauce with a bit of whole milk, and left off the bacon bits and the second half of the cheese.  Turns out it was the right decision, because what I had in the end was just right for me.  Like others, I did not pre-bake the chicken, and it needed 35-40 minutes at 350 uncovered to be cooked through.  Served with brown rice, which was perfect to soak uo all the delicious sauce!

Very good!! I did make some slight changes, per other reviewers. I only used 3 chicken breast halves. I cooked my bacon and then I sauteed the chicken for a very short time in the bacon grease(I also cut the chicken into bite size pieces).  I used 1 bag of fresh spinach, I also sauteed the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter. Then I put my spinach mix on the bottom of the pan, next my chicken pieces,  Then the VERY VERY good sauce and finally the bacon pieces. Cooked at 350 for around 20 minutes, then put 1 cup mozzarella on top and cooked for another 10 minutes. EXCELLENT!!! Will make again.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I've made it several times - and my family - especially the KIDS - just LOVE it!  I sometimes just cook the chicken on the stove top a few minutes on each side to save time, I use turkey bacon bits instead of the "real thing" (since my hubby doesn't eat pork) and I don't use quite as much cheese as the recipe calls for (cholesterol issues in the family).  Otherwise, I go with the recipe as is!  It's one of the few we all can agree on...quick, easy, and YUMMY! 

Thanks for such a great recipe!

I didn't bother cooking the chicken first. I had thin breasts and cut those into serving size pieces. I used 8 oz sliced mushroom and an entire large clamshell of fresh spinach sautéed with the garlic. Everything but the mozzarella was baked, covered, for about 30 min. then added cheese and crushed bacon and popped it back in to finish cooking uncovered. Very tasty. Make sure you use enough Italian seasoning. Served with rice and really liked it the next day in my lunch!

This was great though I did make some additions. I seasoned my chicken with garlic powder, salt, pepper, seasoned salt, and cayenne. I followed another reviewer as far as not cooking the chicken beforehand and baking the dish @350. I also used Colby and Monterey Jack cheese on top instead of mozzarella and made my own bacon crumbles. It was great! My 3 & 6 year old sons loved it, as did my husband!

This is SO good. I did what other reviewers said and sautéed the spinach and mushrooms with  bit of garlic in butter before putting it in the dish. Chopped up the chicken in bite size pieces and heated them a bit in the sauce (which I made exactly as recipe stated) and then topped the spinach with sauce and poured the chicken in the sauce over the spinach and topped with bacon bits. Cooked 25 min at 350. Put mozzarella on and cooked for 10 more min at 400. Topped on whole wheat pasta I made with butter, parm, garlic, and parsley. My daughter said this is one of her favorite things I've ever made... So guess it's a keeper!

No changes were made, although next time I might cook the chicken with some soy sauce. Kids loved it! There were shoveling spinach and mushrooms into their mouth with no regret :) Definitely adding this to our menu!!

This recipe was great.  Since I'm not a fan of mushrooms, I substituted cream of mushroom for cream of potato soup.  It was really good.  Great recipe.  Family loved it.

Seriously, a chicken casserole with a canned soup??! I would have otherwise passed this by but the high rating and popularity of this recipe peeked my curiosity; I didn't think all the great reviews could be wrong. And they weren't.  As others suggested, I grilled my chicken breasts and sautéed fresh spinach and mushrooms in butter.   Don't make the mistake of turning your nose up at this one!  Many thanks for sharing the delicious, easy recipe. And thanks to those of you who provide us with helpful suggestions in your reviews. :)

I and my family absolutely loved it. I did change up the chicken prep, though. I cooked the chicken in a pan with olive oil. Will definitely make this again. Very easy and tasty.

The flavor was OK but it had way too much sauce which really overpowered the spinach and the mushrooms.  I used fresh spinach and wilted it in the microwave and then drained it well.  I doubled the mushrooms but we couldn't find them in all the sauce.  I also used 1% milk but only 1/4 cup. I sliced the chicken breast into 3 strips each and sautéed them in a little olive oil for about 5 minutes.   IF I make this again I will decrease the sauce and only use 1/2 Tbls of the Italian seasoning.

2 1/2 breasts, boiled, sliced into 3 filets each. Use half spinach (better - use small amt fresh next time). Could double mushrooms (or put all on one side). Could reduce chicken to 1 1/2 breasts (lots leftover).

Made this it is delicious as said ! Didn't have lemon juice so omitted it & used bagged spinach (about 1/2 bag) canned spinach is already mushy so thought raw spinach would be better ! Family of 7 ( doubled recipe ) LOVED IT !

Really good with some slight changes. I doubled recipe, and I added 2 cups of rice to the bottom of the pan, with just 1.5 cups water, the sauce provides plenty of moisture to fully cook the rice. I used fresh spinach. I also changed the recipe and did 1 can cream of chicken soup with the 1 can cream of mushroom. It was perfect.

It was soooo good! I didn't have Italian seasoning and I used fresh spinach. I sautéed in the garlic butter for about 2 mins. Took the spinach out and put it in the baking dish. I then added the rest of ingredients to the garlic butter and followed the directions after. My son LOVED it and he's a picky eater...plates were practically licked clean! Lol

Served this to guests and everyone raved.  I agree with  reviewers tips of using fresh spinach (be prepared that once sautéed, you need at least one large clam shell  of spinach) and also liked chopping the pre baked chicken into cubes.  This way people do not have to take a large piece of chicken - they can customize the quantity.  I served with risotto and a sweet kale salad.  The Italian spice is key to the flavour.

First off, I did not have half and half so i just used milk and it came out flavorful (I will use half and half next time). The only change i would make is to use fresh spinach (the can spinach was not my taste). I will saute fresh spinach and the mushrooms with butter and layer both the bottom and one layer over the chicken, then add the sauce, bacon then cheese. Also, I only baked it for 20 minutes and it was still pink, I believe this helped it from not drying out. It was juicy, tender (frozen and thawed chicken) and flavorful.

I always read the reviews of other people who have made it exactly like the recipe and go from there. I did make a couple of changes I used 1/2 a jar of Alfredo sauce instead of the half and half and parmesan cheese. I also didn't bake the chicken but browned it in skillet to keep the meat moist. I removed the chicken and made my sauce in the same skillet I had just cooked the chicken in. It was great. Everyone loved it. I will make this again.

Delicious recipe! Big hit at my dinner table. As previous posters have mentioned its best to sauté the spinach( I purchased mines frozen) with the mushrooms in butter and place on bottom of pan, topped by uncooked chicken , sauce and bacon bits. I used bone in breast so cook time was 40 minutes with an additional 10 for mozzarella cheese. I will prepare this dish again????

I followed another reviewer and didn't pre-cook the chicken but cooked it all together in the oven.  I sauteed the mushrooms & spinach separate w/ a small amount of olive oil before combining.  Also, I used 6 Schwanns chicken breast and it was still a lot of sauce for the amount of chicken.  I made mashed potatoes & cauliflower with it.  The sauce was yummy with the mashed potatoes.  My family liked it.

I made this last night for the first time and I barely got to try any because the men at the table were scarfing it down! They absolutely loved it! I will make a couple of changes to the recipe like not baking the chicken breasts first and use better mozz. But overall we loved it. Thanks!

Very good recipe.  Made with VICSGARDEN's modifications- sautéed mushrooms , adding garlic to the mushrooms, then spinach last, sautéing until wilted.  Placed mushroom/spinach in Pam sprayed casserole dish, then added chicken breasts that had been pounded thinner o tenderize.  Poured the sauce over and followed the directions.

Very rich dish. Always use fresh ingredients. I used fresh steamed spinach. Make sure you trim any fat and connective tissue from the chicken breasts. It will also help if you flay the breasts in half so they are not so thick. This is a MUST TRY.

This was just ok. My family liked it. I thought it was waaayy to salty. It pairs well over a bed of rice or mashed potatoes. 
That helped take away some of the saltiness.  I will make it again but with changes.

YUM. I expected this to be good, but it went far beyond. I followed the changes suggested by FOXFIRE2 (sauteing the spinach and mushrooms with minced garlic, cubing the chicken, using white wine in the sauce, etc.),  baked it for 40 min. (note: you may need to cover with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning), and it was perfect. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the creamy sauce was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I served it over rice, and it was a hit.

I added more garlic, browned the Thin sliced chicken in garlic butter and white wine.  Added more Garlic.  Used Slice portabella - made it awesome, No canned mushrooms.  No half and half, I used some milk.  Heavy cream would have been Way Too much.  It came out Really good..

I soaked the chicken breasts for several hours in a highly citrus marinade, known for wide use in good restaurants before covering them in foil and baking them, so they come out juicy and ready for the casserole dish.  The key secret to Bryan's amazing Chicken Florentine model here is how well the sauce ingredients infuse together, when you "low and slow" simmer it in the saucepan ; the longer, the better--then, take it off heat to cool / thicken.  As you enjoy this the first time--you're going to get inspired to add your own tweaks, but prepared as instructed is very close to restaurant quality.

I used 2% milk instead and cream of celery because my partner can't have mushrooms. Was a little soupy so I had to thicken it with flour. It tasted great! I did not want to overcook the chicken breast so I  skipped the first 20 minute cooking that this recipe called for, and they were moist and tender.

I used fresh spinach (bagged), fresh mushrooms, a little  more real bacon bits (Wright's), and my own seasoning (Italian seasoning, and a little salt-free Greek seasoning). Everyone loved it, so I will continue to make it this way in the future. Great recipe!

I didn't have any bacon so I took some ham lunch meat, cut it up, and fried it :)  I also added 1/2 an onion to the vegetable mixture! Also, as a general rule, I ALWAYS season my meat! So before the first step, I just used some fresh cracked pepper and himalayan sea salt on both sides of the chicken.  I also used a box of frozen spinach instead of canned.  It turned out delish!  I served this with a wild rice & quinoa blend and some crisp steamed green beans!

I just made it easier.  I placed the raw chicken on the bottom of the dish, put a bag of baby spinach over the top, put a box on mushrooms on top of that, then poured the sauce over the top( I did double the sauce and used 6 cloves of fresh crushed garlic. I used whipping cream only 1/2C) baked for 40min. same temp.  Put cooked bacon and cheese on top during the last 15min.  Great combination of ingredients, it was a hit.  Thank you!!

Like some of the others, I diced and cooked the chicken on the stove top to save time.  The only other change I made was adding 3/4 cup of white wine.  Turned out delicious and I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today.

I sautéed chicken breast tenderloins as some smarty suggested in the bacon fat. In the same pan with the drippings, Used a whole bag of baby spinach. Chopped up crimini mushrooms and sautéed with spinach and garlic until liquid mostly gone and spinach nice and wilted. I will use two bags of spinach next time. Reduced sodium cream o' mushroom, butter added with just enough whole milk. Followed the rest of the recipe and it was like something I've had at Olive Garden before. Thanks much for the recipe.

Great dish!  Despite no salt in recipe it tasted salty. Look for low sodium cream of mushroom soup or low sodium cheese.

This was ok.  I love all the ingredients and you would think they went well together....and they did.  I am having a hard time with pinpointing why I wouldn't make it again.  I love cheese and I only used 1 cup of mozzarella and it was still too much.  It was just kinda there in clumps.  But that wasn't really it.  I guess all I can really say is.... It was good but it was unmemorable and nothing I would crave to make again.

Made this for company last night. It was wonderful; got rave reviews! I made 10 breasts in a 9x13 casserole and increased the remaining ingredients accordingly. The breasts I used were huge, and as others suggested, I did not cook the breasts before adding to the casserole. The cook time was about an hour at 400 degrees.
Thanks for an amazing recipe!

This was so delicious! As others did, I sauteed the spinach and mushrooms then layered raw chicken over it. Chicken was moist and flavorful. I also added more bacon to counteract the cheese and butter (not like it was healthy to begin with). Served over spaghetti with garlic bread. Will definately be making again!

This came out very moist and flavorful. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and baked the chicken with the spinach and sauce adding the bacon bits and mozzarella cheese in the last 10 minutes of baking.

This dish was amazing. I used all the ingredients, but added them differently. I agree with other reviews, do not cook the chicken first, it is tough as nails if you do. I sautéed the mushrooms and spinach first, then just added the sauce ingredients to that. I simmered that for a little bit, put a couple spoons of the sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish, laid the raw chicken breasts on top of that, poured the rest of the sauce on top of the chicken, and cooked it for 30 minutes. Took the dish out of the oven, put on moz. cheese, then bacon and put back in the oven for 15 minutes. It was to die for!!! One last piece of advice, I would use thinner chicken breast if possible. The ones I bought were so thick it would have taken forever for them to cook, so I just cut them length wise in half. Came out perfect.

After reading through the reviews I followed the advice of others.  Sautéed the chicken in olive oil and chopped. Sautéed fresh broccoli and shitake mushrooms in oil and butter for the base layer.  Cooked bacon and crumbled. I did not change the ingredients for the sauce.  Baked until bubbly and it was a hit.  Leftovers the following night were just as good.  Definitely a keeper and will make again; however, I would decrease the amount of Italian seasoning in the cream sauce as it was a bit overpowering.

My husband and two teenage daughters loved this!  I sautéed 6 chicken breasts in olive oil.  I put a few layers of fresh spinach in the bottom of a 9x13 pan, put the sautéed chicken on top, covered it with the sauce and then sprinkled real bacon pieces on top.  Into a 350* oven for 20 minutes.  Removed to sprinkle cheese on top.  Back in the oven for another 5 minutes.  I made 50% extra sauce for the two extra chicken breasts, but it really wasn't necessary, and  I only used 1 cup of cheese.  Delicious!!

I took other's advice and did not pre-cook my chicken. I instead filleted my chicken breasts in half to make them thinner and reduce their cook time. I also deleted the bacon and instead cut 2 Tbsp of butter into small pieces and arranged in bottom of prepared casserole dish before piling fresh baby spinach on top. I layered raw sliced mushrooms on top of spinach before covering with raw thin chicken fillets. I poured sauce mix over chicken breasts, grated more fresh Parmesan cheese on top before sprinkling with shredded Mozarrela/Romano cheese. Baked uncovered until chicken was cooked thru and bubbling hot. About 40 minutes. Served over long grain white rice.

Absolutely fabulous!!!! I followed other reviewer's suggestion and did not precook the chicken and I also used fresh spinach, which I sautéed along with the mushrooms in a little of the bacon (I fried my own) grease. I prefer making my things with fresh ingredients and do wish I'd have made my own cream of mushroom soup so as to reduce the sodium.

This is a great recipe.  I made some small changes .....I used a heaping handful of organic baby spring mix (with kale spinach and bib lettuce) and a variety of aisan mushrooms.  Instead of layering the spinach and mushrooms, I mixed them in with the sauce and poured over the chicken breasts.    Fresh grated parmesan in the sauce makes a huge difference.  It was yummy with wide egg noodles.  I will  definitely make this again.  Thanks.

Delicious!! I didn't have all the ingredients, and needed to make only two servings, so here's what I did.  I steamed a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach in the microwave for two minutes, then cut holes in the bag and left in the sink to drain a bit.  I mixed granulated garlic, lemon juice, seasoning, and Parmesan cheese with the cream of mushroom soup for the sauce.  With the moisture from the spinach, adding milk or half and half wasn't necessary.  I didn't have mozzarella, so used a little goat cheese over the spinach, then a little cheddar over the top of the chicken.  Odd combination, I know, but it worked!  It will be even more delicious when I have shopped for the proper ingredients!! Thanks for sharing this delicious low carb recipe!  I'll use this again and again, both for company and "just us"!  Oh, and I skipped the first step, and put just baked the whole thing at 375 for 20-30 minutes (depending on size of chicken pieces).

My family loved it! -modifications: used my Foreman grill to pre-cook my chicken, used fresh spinach, I added sliced yellow squash and zucchini on top of a last layer fresh spinach and portobellos. - took the suggestion of covering all w foil---YUM! The kids raved over this dish! :D

I made this EXACTLY as written, and it was fantastic!!  Precooking the chicken for 20 minutes is key!  Makes it moist and juicy when baked with the rest of the ingredients.  Family raved about this dish!  Impressive enough to serve to guests.  Will make again and again!

Great. I made  it in crock pot -covered uncooked chicken with the sauce on high for about 3 hours. Threw some fresh spinach and cooked noodles into the crockpot for about 10 minutes before serving. Chicken fell apart. Next time I'll go lighter on the Italian seasoning.  Easy and yum!!

I left everything the same and just followed the directions it came out great! The chicken wasn't dry either. I think if you cook it part way through and then take it out and let the chicken cook the rest of the way in the sauce spinach and mushrooms. delicious I love this dish and so does my family!

I used shrimp instead of chicken, sautéed the spinach and mushrooms in white wine as another user suggested. Since I really don't do diary used coconut creamer and trader joes box cream of mushroom soup, mixed in remaining liquid from sautéing the spinach and mushroom along with the recipe's sauce ingredients...used a little cornstarch to thicken it and mixed shrimp in the sauce the poured over the spinach and mushroom mix in a baking pan. Came out really good!

Like many reviewers said, the canned spinach was not good! I would use fresh spinach next time. I made the recipe exactly except with milk instead of half n half and I added mashed sweet potato Yams over the spinach in the casserole dish before topping with sauce and baking. oh i also cooked the chicken in cubes in the skillet first. my husband said it was one of my best!

Like a number of other reviewers, I made a few changes, but concur that the basic recipe is pretty dang good. Changes made: thighs (instead of breasts); cooked on the stove with a tiny bit of olive oil (instead of dry in the oven); unsweetened almond milk (instead of 1/2 & 1/2 or milk); 1 bag fresh spinach (instead of frozen); 1/4 c chopped red bell pepper (for the color to combat the "ugliness" of the dish otherwise; served over rice (instead of as-is with bacon bits).
Thankfully, it freezes well in small portions so that I didn't tuck in and just eat the whole pan at once. I liked it very much.

Excellent! It was a little soupier then I expected, but still tasted really good. I used fresh spinach, sauteed with garlic and onion (needed more then 1 box). Then followed suggestions and just put in raw chicken & covered with sauce and bacon and baked, covered in 350 for 1 hour. Served with simple couscous side. Everyone loved it, even my 1 year old! Will make again.

Made as written, and while the rest of my family loved it, im not crazy about canned spinach so I think it would've been better with fresh or frozen. Five stars are for a happy family - the canned vegetable issue could very well be all in my head & I'm always harder on myself when it comes to the taste of food I prepare. This recipe itself is tasty, easy, and deserving of praise.

This recipe is a nice starting idea, but I rated it poorly due to the number of things I had to/chose to change.  1. Made the recipe healthier by only using 1/8 cup butter, 1% milk instead of half and half and only 1 cup of mozzarella cheese on top.  You still end up with a nice creamy sauce and it is plenty of cheese.  2.  Used 2 - 10 oz. packages frozen spinach, it gets lots of spinach into the recipe and is cheaper than the fresh spinach...it gets cooked down anyways.  Also used 8 oz. mushrooms because that's the amount that usually comes in a package.  3.  Used 6 chicken breasts instead of 4.  4.  Made the prep process much easier.  Saute the mushrooms in butter, mix in spinach until heated through, layer on bottom of baking dish, arrange chicken on top, cover with sauce, bake for 30 minutes, top with cheese, bake for additional 10 minutes, top with real crumbled bacon before serving.  The chicken was properly cooked through.

Very good, I followed the directions exactly besides the mushrooms because I forgot to buy them. I think I'll use fresh spinach and cook it instead of the can, mostly because it tasted like canned spinach. We still really enjoyed it though.

This is a good concept, and it was OK. However, I agree with another reviewer that it is too rich... the condensed soup is just too strong. If you can somehow tone down the soup it would be very good. I will try again with a lighter version of the sauce. Also, I recommend using fresh spinach and mushrooms. I sauteed mine first and layered everything else on top and it was my favorite part of the dish.

This was very good.  I substituted frozen spinach and extra chicken (cut up).  Next time I would try fresh spinach and two cans of cream of mushroom soup, because it was a little watery from the spinach and needed more sauce to cover the chicken.

This was really good.  We served it over a multigrain rice.  I second the tip to use fresh spinach.  We used frozen after we opened the canned up, its been many years since I used canned spinach and it was awful.  Threw it out and used what we had left frozen.  Also, subbed greek yogurt for half and half since that is what we had. Will definitely make again.

Everything was good except the bacon bits, which totally ruined it for us. If I did this again, I might use seasoned croutons or maybe nothing at all.... the bacon bits turned it into a total salt overload and made it harder to taste the simple flavors of the spinach, cheeses & chicken.

I made this last weekend, and it was fantastic. I was worried that baking the chicken would dry it out, so I pan-fried it in olive oil instead. I substituted the half-and-half with milk because that's what I had on had. I also used fresh spinach rather than canned and cooked my own bacon and crumbled it instead of using bacon bits. My husband raved over this dish, as did I. I will be making this again. Five stars!

Great dish! I have a pretty large family and I used more chicken than the recipe called for.  So I had to stretch the recipe with alfredo sauce.

Family loved it and they are picky!  I did like most people and sautéed the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter and placed in bottom of dish then placed the uncooked chicken on top, added the sauce and topped it off with real crumbled bacon and baked for 25 minutes at 350. Removed from oven and topped with 1 cup mozzarella and continued baking for 10 minutes at 350 (not 400). It was so moist and flavorful!

Made this last night for me & my husband. This is fantastic!! the flavor of the sauce was so yummy. He LOVED this dish!! I went exactly by the recipe. I doubled the sauce so I would have extra for the penne pasta. We have alot of leftovers and trust me it will get eaten :) Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was a really great meal with a few alterations.  I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and only a couple tablespoons of butter for the mushrooms and garlic.  It is such a rich meal that the alterations truly did not make a difference but cut out some fat.  I marinated the chicken first in a little italian dressing and added about a 1/4 cup of pinot grigio to hot baking dish last minute and let it simmer for a few before adding the spinich/mushroom/sauce mix to the bottom of the pan.  We ended up using less cheese but this may have been because we only had a couple chicken breasts.  I will definately make this again for company!

delicious and perfect for a nice, heavy occasional meal! I started with the bacon in a cast iron skillet and browned, set aside, and browned the chicken in the same pan with the bacon drippings before putting the entire pan in the oven for 20 mins on 350. I made my own cream of mushroom from scratch, added a little extra milk, butter, freshly grated garlic and nutmeg, and simmered until thick. After removing the skillet with the chicken from the oven, I removed it from the pan and wilted 2 bags of fresh baby spinach into that same skillet with 2 tb butter and 1/2 cup white wine until the spinach was wilted. Topped the spinach with 1/2 the sauce and finished as the recipe stated. BRILLIANT!

Got 4 stars for ease and quickness, but was lacking a bit of flavor. Next time I'm adding salt or more bacon and will spice up chicken.
Update - Made it a second time - 5 stars.  Used fresh spinach (wilted) and fresh mushrooms sauted in bacon grease - A lot less healthy, a lot tastier!

Served this over tubed pasta last night and we enjoyed it.  Took other's advise and placed raw chicken bone-in breasts over sautéed fresh spinach, garlic and mushrooms.  Added wine to sauté and also cream sauce that went over chicken.  I cut the mozzarella cheese and bacon in 1/2...to reduce some of the calories of this dish.  I believe we didn't miss a thing.

I used a large bag of fresh spinach instead of canned, and 2 percent milk since that was all I had on hand. I also dredged the chicken in seasoned flour and did a quick saute' instead of baking on a baking sheet. My family LOVED it.  My husband said this is the best chicken dish he's ever eaten.  I doubled the sauce, and will be putting it over angel hair pasta later in the week.  Thanks for an easy, delicious recipe!

DH gave it 5 stars, I gave it 3, so I averaged at 4 :)  We are not big mushroom people, so I subbed out onions for the mushrooms, and cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom.  I made my own bacon bits.  I sauteed fresh spinach with the onion in some butter and some leftover bacon grease.  I did not cook the chicken, but cut it up and put it on top of the spinach. Served everything over bowtie pasta.  Everything was good, but a little too rich for my liking.  I will make this again, but sub out some of the butter and not use bacon grease to sautee the spinach.  I will admit, this was very tasty, just a bit too heavy.

Delicious!  I did not cook the chicken before and I will use frozen spinach next time (easier to work with).  My young children raved about it and there were no leftovers.

I thought this was really gross and just didn't have the right flavors. This was definitely the worst of all the recipes I've tried from AllRecipes, from which I usually have great successes!!

Excellent recipe!  When I melted the butter in the saucepan I browned the chicken breasts in it, then sauteed the mushrooms (doubled the amount of mushrooms) in it. I used frozen spinach, defrosted and squeezed the liquid out.  I followed the rest of the recipe.   Baked at 350 for about 40 minutes.  We all loved this!

Great starter recipe. I didn't like the sauce so I ended up doctoring it until I could stand the taste. Now I use fresh spinach and mushrooms and a creamy cheese sauce. I definitely stay away from the Italian seasoning, I only like that for piazza.

This had a good flavor, and was tasty, but it was very "heavy"... I used fresh spinach (a lot of it), less butter, and less mozz cheese, and fresh mushrooms that I sautéed first.  Good recipe, but be prepared to have a very hearty, thick, rich meal.  The sauce is by no means a light sauce.

Absolutely one of the best recipes I have found for chicken breasts. My wife and stepson are very picky eaters, but they both loved this recipe and ask for it over and over again. This recipe is also very easy to make.

Do not use canned spinach if you make this.  The sauce is a good start and the cheesy bacon topping is good as well but overall nothing in this recipe goes together.

I followed the recipe as-is, and there was WAY too much spinach and bacon bits.  If I ever make this again, I will definitely use less spinach and bacon bits.

This was very yummy.  I did brown my chicken in a drizzle of olive oil for about 4 minutes before assembling the casserole.   I used frozen spinach.   It was so very good.  :)

Good, although I did make some changes (like 2000 other people, I see). I used fat-free milk instead of half and half, "healthy recipe" soup, only one tablespoon of butter and one cup of reduced-fat mozzarella. I seared the chicken in a pan on the stove in a little olive oil spray, then removed the chicken, added the butter, chopped mushrooms and garlic to the same pan and made the sauce there. I also used two 10 oz packages of frozen spinach. Four stars for the recipe as written because 2/3 cup of bacon bits is REALLY a lot (I pretty much covered the top of my dish with two tablespoons), and because baking is probably the least flavorful way to make chicken ever. Next time I would add some salt to the spinach before covering with the chicken and sauce.

The sauce is rich and delicious although very salty.  The bacon provides a wonderful smokey flavor.  Very elegant dish. For those cooking in high altitudes, if you skip step one as some of the reviewers suggest and put raw chicken, cut into chunks, in the casserole, I recommend turning the oven up to 365 and cooking for 40 minutes.  Chicken will be cooked through and very juicy and tender.  Don't wait to put the mozzarella cheese on top. It will cook just fine without burning.

Great taste, my husband loved it!
After reading the reviews, I decided to not cook the chicken first. I pounded the chicken thin and seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic powder.
I used whole milk, doubled the mushrooms, 3 pieces of ready bacon crumbed on top 3 minutes before done and used frozen (drained spinach). 
I will make this again. Easy and delish.

My family LOVED this meal! As did I. My husband eve said it was his new favourite!  I didn't have bacon bits on hand so I made my own and I think was even better than premade ones from the store.  Can't wait to make it again!

It is very tasty! However, next time I will do a lot less spinach. Canned spinach is not so great and 2 cans was way too much. Also, I will double the sauce and add caramelized onions. The cheese on top is sooo good!!

I knew this would be delicious, and it was superb!  I used thawed, frozen spinach with the water squeezed  out.  I used jarred mushrooms bc it's what I had on hand, and I added a bit of sea salt, garlic granules and pepper to the chicken prior to baking.  Do to our preferences, I added granulated garlic and onion powder to the cream mixture. The completed dish had a lovely brown crust, and the spinach tasted like a delicious creamed spinach.  I will be making this dish regularly.  Thank you Bryan0320 for this fantastic recipe which is good enough for company.

My husband absolutely loved this one and told me it was a keeper, and seldom does he volunteer this kind of information! Didn't add bacon since I didn't have any, and it was still good! We had a little left over, so later in the week I served it on top of chicken breast topped with marinara sauce and grated asiago cheese. Another winner!

Another keeper. Cubed and cooked the chicken first(boiled), sauteed with half a diced onion and a clove of garlic (minced) in bacon grease from the 4 pieces of bacon I cooked first. In separate pan sauteed fresh mushrooms (16 oz) and a bag of fresh spinach, with two cloves of garlic (minced) and a splash of white wine. Spread the spinach/mushroom mixture on bottom of casserole dish, leaving juices in pan. Used left over juices to start white sauce. Mixed chicken and onion in white sauce and spread over top of spinach/mushrooms. Crumbled bacon on top. And topped with about a cup of mozzarella. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes while rice was cooking. (1 cup rice)

This is an excellent basic recipe and even better the next day. Sorry, but I did adjust some things to suite my personal taste. 
Next time I'll use about 1/2 the amount of Parmesan (too salty) and cut the Mozzarella a bit, maybe use a little less butter and add some wine. (Meant to add it anyway but forgot). I used FF cream, frozen spinach (should have used fresh), and left over roasted chicken. 
I don't care for Italian Seasoning but if I had used it, I would cut it back to 1 tsp. at the most.
Used about 1/2 tsp. each Thyme and Basil. I may  try some Rosemary too.
Thank you for a great new recipe. I will make it many times.

This was absolutely delicious! I read what other people suggested and cooked bacon myself, then chopped up and cooked the chicken in the bacon grease (maybe not the healthiest alternative but definitely tasty). Besides that I followed everything else just like the recipe and it turned out fantastic. There were no leftovers and I'm still hearing how great it was weeks later!

Delicious!  I followed other's suggestion of skipping step one.  I also cheated a little with my chicken and brought Perdue pre-seasoned chicken breast with white wine.  I used freash baby spinach and placed the uncooked chicken on top and poured the sauce over it.  I covered the dish and cooked it on 350 for 45 minutes.  Outstanding!!  I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious! I needed to make it gluten-free, so instead of the can of soup, used 2 oz. cream cheese and 1/2 c. sour cream. Also used fresh spinach. Very creamy and cheesy. Yum.

Gave it 4 stars only because my family felt it had too much spinach.  We like spinach; but it was a little overpowering in this dish.  I would definitely make it again just with less spinach.

Good entree. I recommend one can of spinach and adding an extra can of mushroom soup. Noodles are an excellent addition.

Delicious! I made this for a small Christmas dinner party and everyone loved it.  I served it with a bed of fettuccine. I cooked down 2 bags of spinach and wish I would have done 3.  2 cooked bags was enough to cover the pan but would have liked a little more.  Also, I did not include the bacon.  I found it unnecessary and it was perfect without it.

This is an awesome dish! I did make some adjustments, suggested by other reviewers. I left out the mushrooms (not a fan). I sauteed fresh spinach (two bags) with olive oil and minced garlic. I cooked some bacon in the same pan, then sauteed the chicken breasts in the same pan (after removing most of the bacon grease). I added chopped dried onion to the sauce and used skim milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2. I also put a little part-skim mozzarella in with the cream sauce, as well as on top. I baked (uncovered) at 375 for about 30 minutes. Delicious!

I followed the recommendations of vicsgarden, but used store bought real bacon bits.  Perhaps that was the problem, because it was salty.  However, this has great flavor and I will make it again, reducing the garlic, Italian seasoning and bacon bits in half.  Thanks Bryan0320

Very easy and very good. Next time I will saute the chicken because it came out a bit dry. I also cut back on the mozzarella cheese and will try it with ff milk in place of half/n/half...maybe it will help a bit on the calories ;)

Amazing!! I took advice from previous reviews and sauteed fresh spinach and mushrooms with 2 tablespoons of garlic. Also I boiled the chicken & cubed it instead of baking it beforehand and then mixed it with the sauce. It turned out really good! I'll definitely be making it again.

I made a few changes. I used left over sliced chicken from a roasted chicken. I didn't use any butter and never missed it.  Who needs the extra fat calories!!! I also used frozen spinach, thawed and drained and about 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning. Other than that I followed the recipe. My husband RAVED about it all through dinner! It was absolutely DELICIOUS!

My husband hates spinach, so I changed the spinach to collard greens. He loved it and it was delicious. I cooked the garlic in the bacon grease and sauted the greens with it. I didn't cook the chicken first, I just cooked them for 25 min covered, 10 uncovered at 350 degrees. It came out perfect! I did use milk because that is all I had, but next time I think I will try it with the cream and a dash of nutmeg. Great recipe!

this was a great DISH! However, I think I'd subsitute some things with lower sodium, like the condensed mushroom and I'd get the unsalted butter, just to control for salt. I used real bacon instead of bacon bits and added the bacon drippings to the sauce, and I brined my chicken, makes it more juicy and tender and I used FRESH spinach instead of frozen, just pile it on the bottom and it will cook down, don't have to worry about drainage or drying. GREAT recipe~

Made this tonight with a few variations. I was short on time so I chopped the chicken and sauteed it till cooked, took it out of the pan and made the sauce as directed. I used milk because it was what I had. I only used one can of spinach b/c hubby doesn't like it, I didn't have any bacon and used slices of mozzarella to top.This turned out really well for a last minute idea. hubby couldn't taste the spinach & didn't notice the mushrooms b/c I chopped them up. I served it with whole wheat rotini. I'll keep this in the rotation

This was awesome! I don't lik mushrooms, so I used cream of chicken instead and left the mushrooms out. I put this over some past and baked it all together. It is awesome! It's a keeper!

Ok, I followed this to the t... it was amazing! I loved it a lot and my husband could NOT stop eating this. Hahahaha... my only recomended change would be... DON'T USED CANNED SPINACH.  I used canned spinach from safeway and it just tasted so odd. I drained it, but it still seemed really mushy after I cooked this and it had a really... really metalicy grassy flavor... like... I pulled spinach straight out of an ocean or something. LOL... I'm not a cook by any means and the rest of this recipe is amazing and I will DEFINITELY make this again... but next time I might just try cooking my own spinach up first then using that.. .or frozen spinach. Because the canned stuff was a little overpowering in taste... and not goo taste.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

my boyfriend enjoyed this so much it was moved up to top 10 status. my favorite part about it was the spinach being placed on the bottom of the pan so my boyfriend who has tummy issues didn't have to add it but I could still enjoy it.

The soup mixture was the champ!  I definitely agree with some of the other posts about prepping fresh spinach with garlic and bacon instead, but in a pinch, the canned spinach does just fine.  I'm sure you did that to simply the process, and I totally understand that.  As some are turned off by too many steps.  A+ recipe, would make again!  Cheers!

Used frozen spinach and canned mushrooms, added a chopped onion.  Loved it - it was excellent over whole wheat pasta.

DELICIOUS!!! I have gotten hundreds of great recipes off this site, but never taken the time to post a review. I did precook the chicken for about 20 mins wrapped in foil to keep the moisture in, used can spinach as sugguessted, but think I will use raw next time, I drained the cans but still found it a touch to runny. The mushrooms cooked great, the sauce is so amazing, I will be using it on pasta soon!!

This was AMAZING! Very creamy and rich in flavor. I followed other's advices to put the raw chicken breasts in before baking and the chicken breasts were juicy and tender. I have also tried this recipe as a casserole drop-off for a family member with Rotisserie chicken and they also loved it! Awesome dish that will become a staple in our home.

exchanged the spinach and mushrooms for noodles (cook first) and needs to have chicken cooked or at least started before baking.

Made this recipe tonight... Changed a few things. I also did not pre-bake the chicken. I laid the raw, defrosted chicken breasts on a bed of sauteed (with butter) spinach, mushrooms and YELLOW ONIONS. I also used turkey bacon to top it off.  YUMMMMM!

Excellent recipe, easy to follow. I suggest cutting chicken into smaller pieces so it is more like a casserole than chicken baked in a sauce.  I substituted frozen spinach for canned because we had that on hand.  It's a little heavy in the garlic dept for my tastes so we cut that down.  Next time I will probably saute garlic in some oil then give the chicken a quick brown in the pan than assemble per the recipe. Definitely adding this to regular rotation.

Very heavy and rich. My family was saying, "mmm yum" on the first bite, but by the last they were saying, "uggh". For us, it would not be something that I would make often or we would all weigh 800 pounds. I made it with a 16 oz bag of frozen spinach, skim milk and and real bacon. If I would make it again, I'd cut the butter down.

Sinfully DELICIOUS!  This recipe is so delicious that my family had me make it two nights in a row.  We were then on a diet of celery for the rest of the week!! ;)  With the butter, cream of mushroom soup, half-and-half, parm cheese, bacon and mozzarella, it truly is an artery's worse nightmare...but I swear it was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten.  Absolutely wonderful!  Instead of 4 chicken breasts, I used lots of chicken breast tenders...I think this made it a lot tastier as each bite was surrounded by the flavorful sauce.  There were no leftovers and the diners ranged from age 4 yrs. to 80 yrs.

This was not good at all. There is too much going on here: way too much spinach and mozzarella for the small amount of chicken, and the sauce does not compliment the dish at all. I will not be making this again. No one in the house liked it.

This was really good.  I made the sauce a couple of days ahead, and then used shrimp instead of chicken, and this was very nice.  Could work as a nice side dish as well with a protein.  I used canned spinach and that was okay in a pinch.

This dish was a 5* for my family. They gobbled it up and asked when I would fix it again. I did substitute 3   10oz packages of frozen chopped spinach for the canned, but the sauce it what makes the dish!

This was a VERY tasty and delicious recipe.  There was only one problem - WAY too much spinach.  I would cut to one can.  My kids loved it and they loved spinach but it was too much.  I am making it tonight with whole wheat pasta and frozen spinach in a 10x13 pan.

My boyfriend absolutely loved this dish!  I used real bacon and fresh spinach and also browned the chicken before placing in oven...then deglazed with a little chardonnay for a wonderful sauce.

I changed this up a little and the family loved it.  First, I cooked the chicken as directed and chopped it up once cooled.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with the mushrooms and garlic in 1 tbsp. butter and 1 tbsp. olive oil.  I added the remaining ingredients with the diced chicken and mixed it with 12 oz.  dry pasta, cooked.  Bake as directed.

Excellent!!! Sauteed cut up chicken with 1/4 cup onions in 1 Tbs Olive oil, and 1 TBS Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning. Also mixed everything up, rather than layering and topped with the mozzarella cheese.

Very yummy. Had to use 1 package of frozen spinach & 4 oz of canned shrooms since that's what I had. Besides that I followed the recipe and it was very hearty and delicious. I will definitely make this again, my husband loved it.

This was extremely good.  The only complaint I really have was that it was a little too rich.  I also used fresh spinach and that just made it so yummy!!  I'm thinking about using pasta with it next time!  Definitely keeping this one!

Love this recipe!!! It was delicious!!! My BF said it tasted like something from a fancy restaurant!! I did make a few changes in the preparatation just because it was easier for me. I boiled the chicken breasts in chicken broth the day before and cubed it up. I cooked the mushrooms in butter and then added the garlic, lemon, 2 cans of soup, italian seasoning, half and half (a little more than 1/2 cup since I used 2 cans of soup), parmesan cheese. I bought 2 bags fresh spinach leaves at the store and wilted them in the microwave for 2 minutes. Put them in a colander and drained them well and then tore them into pieces on the bottom of the pan. Make sure you spray Pam on the baking dish for easy clean up. I put the spinach in, then half of the soup mixture, then the cubed chicken, the remaining soup, bacon bits, and topped with the mozzarella. Served it over fettucini noodles. DELICIOUS!!! Can't wait for the leftovers tonight!!!

Awesome!!! I made this with milk because I didn't have the half and half it called for and I also didn't have the mushrooms. It was wonderful. I did what some others suggested and left the chicken raw. I actually cut it into strips and used fresh spinach. I would definitely make this again! I think it would even be good over some pasta. I'm trying that next time. You won't be disappointed with this recipe.

My husband loved this recipe and he doesn't even like spinach.  Definitely a keeper.  I did reduce the spinach by only using one box of frozen, but I had less chicken too.

What a fabulos filling rich meal! One thing I would do different the 2 nd time around is either boil or slow cook the chicken and shread it. Our 10 year old isn't so awsome with cutting meat....uggh. But all in all very tasty.....thank you.

The only modification I made was grilling the chicken first - then baking. Loved it. Simple - yummy. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms so might make it without next time and see how it goes.

This was pretty good. I didn't cook the chicken first but cut up and threw in raw. I used soft bacon bits and I think maybe that is why the dish was way to salty.  Will make again but use "real bacon" Next time and I will cut down on the cheese a little as well.  Thanks for the easy dish!

This was amazing!  Am trying it for the second time tomorrow night and this time I will have all the ingredients.  The first time I had no mushrooms, lemon juice and had to subsitute milk for the half and half (used 1/4 cup).  Also I used fresh spinach which I wilted in a pan.  It was FANTASTIC!!  Love the buttery, creamyness of it and it's a great way to use up extra spinach, leftover chicken or parmigianno reggiano.  If you can, cook the chicken however you like a day or two ahead so it's quicker to assemble.

Very good recipe! I baked my chicken under aluminum foil to keep it tender and seasoned it with some adobo, olive oil, and worcester sauce. Cut it up and put on top of the spinach. I also sauteed my spinach and mushrooms with olive oil, minced garlic, and sea salt first. Turned out soooo delicious@@ I highly recommend this easy casserole!

My husband loved this casserole. I added slices of polenta on top of the spinach layer. I think I will cut up chicken into chunks the next time that I make it.

I agree with VICSGARDEN... spot on!  Really good, just a little dry probably due to first baking step. And I turned the oven down to 350 also, cooking a little bit longer. My family really liked this!  Thanks!

This recipe was good, but I'd make several changes if I were to make it again.  First off, there's way more sauce than my husband and I needed, so I'd cut that in half probably.  Secondly, to save calories I would try to use skim milk instead of half and half.  With the cream of mushroom, I don't think it would influence the consistency because it's already thick.  Lastly, you can cut the cheese quite a bit, too.  It was good, but there are several things I'll try to make it healthier.

I used one, very well drained can of canned spinach and it just seemed to overpower it. If you use spinach, use fresh spinach. Otherwise the flavor was good. Will make again but without the canned spinach. I also couldn't tell what the lemon juice added to flavor so you may want to skip it if you don't have any.

Delicious.. BUT.. my fiance and I think the chicken was a little uncooked. Maybe 10 minutes more would work better. The sause is absolutely yummy and for sure we will try with shrimp and spaghetti next time!!

this was good, but lacked something. I ate it as a casserole, but the leftovers got mushed up and put on tortilla chips, and THAT was yummie. I guess it was something to do with the saltyness of the chips. So this is WAY better as a dip then as a casserole. thanks for the recipe.

The sauce is great, the chicken is ok but even with not precooking, the chicken it is a bit dry. I think boneless, skinless chicken is dry period ( yes, it's healthier, of course). I might try it with veal next time. The sauce is very good.

I sauteed garlic and white wine with the spinach and butter, I also added onions to it. I added a little bit of mozzarella cheese to the sauce. Very good and cheesy.

My husband actually told me that I can make this every week from now on. I did take the advice of other reviews and used a bag of fresh spinach sauteed with some mushrooms and cooking wine. I don't think canned spinach would have been as fresh tasting. When finished I put on top of some Lipton butter and herb rice. Very tasty!

Pretty simple dish, I thought it came out pretty good.  As suggested sauteed the spinach and mushrooms.  Used milk instead of half n half.  mixed half the mozzo cheese with the sauce.  topped with the other half but i did from the beginning which burnt the cheese.  didn't use bacon bits to make it a bit healthier.  i would make it again but i dont think my gf really like it.

I used portobello mushrooms, frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) and cooked it on the stove.  Served it over butterflied chicken cooked on the grill.  I also served angel hair pasta coated in EVOO and salt and pepper.  INCREDIBLE!!!

Well, the paired down "healthier" version was fabulous...so I bet the original is even better.  I only used 1 1/2 T butter & substituted fat free half and half  & used broccoli (all I had) a little less of the cheeses & left out the bacon bits.  We really loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was amazing!!! Only a few changes...Fresh spinach (ate canned spinach as a kid and can't do it) sauteed with mushrooms, onion, and garlic and layered in the bottom of the baking dish. Halved the chicken breasts and sauteed them until brown on both sides and barely pink in the middle. Placed on the bed of spinach. Mix together juice of 1/2 a lemon, garlic, cream of mushroom soup, Italian seasoning, half-and-half, Parmesan cheese, and 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, diced. Pour over chicken. Top with Mozzarella cheese and fresh bacon bits. Baked at 400F until cheese was brown and bubbly. Served with orzo and sauteed brussel sprouts. Delicious!

flavor was nice, i cut up the chicken pieces as others had done, but next time i will make this with chicken breasts whole, instead of pieces. Also added some cooking sherry, and it was a nice flavor!

Excellent recipe.  As other reviewers suggested, I did not bake the chicken first, I just placed the whole raw chicken breasts in between the sauce layers.  I think cooking the chicken in the dish maybe adds a bit of extra liquid because the white sauce was not as thick after cooking.  I will reduce the half and half to 3/8 cup next time.

It was soooooo Good! My husband ranted and raved about this dish!!! The italian seasoning really gave this dish some serious flavor. It was kind of labor intensive and stressful to cook with two little ones in my kitchen, but this will definitely be a sunday company favorite in our home. Well worth the effort!

Turned out delicious! This was the first recipe that I used in my newly remodeled kitchen with my new appliances so it was a lot of fun! I used fresh spinach and sauted it in a pan with olive oil and fresh minced garlic. I cooked the chicken first because I wanted to make sure that the chicken was done. It turned out delicious. I will definitely be making it again. I might use milk next time since it is healthier.

Delish! I omitted a few ingredients bc my husband is rather picky. (No can of soup, half-and half, spinach.) I converted the recipe to 2 people. First brushed the uncooked chicken with lemon juice, then the melted butter. I then sprinkled the Italian seasoning on. I sliced 2 garlic cloves for a lighter garlic taste and placed on seasoned chicken. Then sprinkled the Parm cheese and Italian shredded cheese. Baked at 350 in a pan covered w/foil for 30 minutes. Uncovered and baked additional 20 minutes. Wow! I used the savory juices to drizzle over some mashed potatoes I made, served broccoli and it was amazing! This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing! (The juices were very tasty on the broccoli, too.)

horrible directions. i didn't know whose to follow so I followed these:  "This is a 5-star recipes using the techniques described by a previous reviewer. "Skip the first step. Then sauté the spinach and mushrooms in a little butter and place in bottom of dish. Then place the uncooked chicken on top, add the sauce and top it off with real crumbled bacon and bake for 25 minutes at 350. Remove from oven and top with 1 cup mozzarella and continue baking for 10 minutes at 350."   Yeah.. don't do that. I did and the chicken was NOWHERE near done, took at LEAST another 30 minutes more.

This got 2 thumbs up all around the table.  I incorporated a lot of the previous comments.  I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic, fresh mushrooms and spinach in 1/4 c. of butter first.  Browned the chicken a few minutes on each side instead of the first step.  I think this would also be good with sundried tomatoes mixed into the sauce mixture.   Can't wait to make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe (I did not make any changes). I did feel it lacked something, though I can't quite put my fingers on what. It was still tasty, none-the-less. Next time I'll look into other reviewers' suggestions.

This was pretty good & fairly easy to throw together. I did make a few changes based on other reviewers suggestions. First I sauteed the spinach & mushrooms in olive oil & spread it in my pan, then cut up my chicken into bite sized pieces & put it on top of the mushroom/spinach mixture uncooked. Poured the sauce on top & sprinkled bacon on top with real crumbled bacon. Cooked at 350 for 25 min. sprinkled mozzarella on top & then baked another 10 min. It was very yummy! My hubby thought it looked like slop & wasn't sure he liked it but we both enjoyed it! My only complaint was that I used 6 thin chicken breasts instead of 4 & I had a ton of sauce! I think next time I make this I will make some plain pasta & then serve this on top of pasta. That way there's not just a ton of leftover sauce.  Then this meal will be perfect!!!

This was good, don't get me wrong. But I had a hard time baking the chicken. It was getting dried out. I would suggest frying it.

I tried this dish last night and it was a hit.  I used chicken breast tenderloins and baked them in a baking dish for a while and they ended up super tender (falling apart).  I also sauteed fresh spinach and mushrooms in extra garlic (we love garlic in my house).  I also only used 1 cup of mozzarella.  It was wonderful.

Delicious, but fattening!  I used 1 1/2 bags of baby spinach as suggested and doubled the mushrooms.  I also did not pre-cook the chicken.  I Sauteed the mushrooms and spinach first then drained the excess liquid.  As suggested by others, I cooked the chicken for 25 min. at 350 F, uncovered, added the mozzarella, then cooked for 10 more at 350 F.  It was the juiciest and most tender chicken I've ever had!

This was really good, I may try using frozen spinach next time instead of canned, for a fresher flavor. I served the extra sauce over penne noodles. The kids really liked this one! Delicious!

This recipe was awsome! I doubled the recipe and used whole milk instead of half and half and served over brown rice. I also used fresh spinach and mushrooms because it's what I had. Everyone who had it was begging for the recipe! It will definitely be added to my regular rotation of recipes.

I thought this was a tasty dish. I used my skillet to brown the bacon. Drained the bacon grease. Put 2 TLB of butter in the skillet, browned ~ 1/3 cup diced onion, 1 garlic clove, the splash of white wine (good suggestion by others), the Italian seasoning, drained a can of mushrooms and added that. After 1 or 2 minutes of saute, I added the spinach. After 1 or 2 minutes, I added the cream of mushroom soup, lemon juice & half-and-half. Once that was all mixed, I added the Parmesan cheese. I poured this into the 9x9 pan, sprinkled the bacon bits on top and because I didn't have Mozzarella cheese on hand, I used an aged white cheddar. In the oven for 25 minutes and it was great over noodles! A keepr recipe!

I made this recipe last night because I am sick of making boring chicken breast..I have to say it was really good .. even my PICKY husband liked it.. ! I used fresh spinach (sauteed it first to steam, frozen would work too.. but I am not a fan of canned)-  I also had a big portobella mushroom i wanted to use, so i diced that and used it instead of regular mushrooms. I basically did what the recipe said except I noticed the top was browning faster than the casserole was "bubbling"- so, i covered it, turned it down to 375 and baked a little longer.. I wanted the casserole to bubble a little more to blend all the flavors..  Excellent with a side of angel hair pasta. .. Staple in my house.. and was very easy to make !

Really enjoyed this! I'll admit I didn't cook it as a "casserole" though. I made the whole thing on stovetop. I sauteed my own bacon and some onions, then added the raw chicken, mushrooms and other ingredients. Used garlic powder instead of garlic. I was surprised that I didn't have to add anymore spices! It tasted lovely and has a very rich taste. I also used frozen chopped spinach like other reviewers suggested and served over Fettucini noodles. Very good!!!

Fantastic! Like others, I slightly remixed it. I sauteed fresh spinach in a little lite butter along with 2 of the three tbsp of minced garlic. I then made the sauce in the same pan to soak up that flavor. I added freshly cracked pepper as well. I served it with buttered and seasoned no-yolk egg noodles. My fiance really enjoyed it.

Did as another reviewer suggested and cooked chicken in the leftover bacon grease. I also didn't understand why it's called a casserole. I added my own noodles to make it a casserole, topped with bacon and mozzorella and baked. Yum!

My husband and I loved this meal.  I put the raw chicken breasts on top of the sauteed fresh spinach with lots of garlic, used fat free half & half, made my own bacon bits from left over ham deli slices, and baked uncovered for about 30 minutes before adding the bacon bits & mozzarella cheese - then baked until the cheese was just starting to brown.  Served with rice & garlic bread - excellent meal!

Made this for the first time tonight and my WHOLE family Loved it! I changed a little to fit my three teenage sons who eat me out of house and home.  I used 1 bag of 2.5lb frozen chicken tenders (Target brand) and defrosted them and cooked them in a little garlic and oil. Set aside. I then cooked one bag of fresh spinage in same pan until soft. In the mean time I cooked 1 1/2lbs of pasta.  Transfered spinage as first layer in a casserole pan. Then added cooked pasta and then the chicken. I made the sauce as stated except that I did not have any 1/2 & 1/2 so I just used 2% milk. I had bacon bits left over from our superbowl party and just used those.  I added a liitle extra milk and some more garlic salt to taste and then baked for 20 min.  YUM!! and I had plenty for lunch tomorrow and snacks for after school.  Thank you for the quick and easy idea!  Will certainly be making this again!

Great recipe! I only had frozen spinach on hand so i sauteed it in a pan with onions and garlic and followed the recipe from there. My family loves onions so i figured it would give more flavor.  I also used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom because im not a big fan of mushrooms. Very easy to make followed the other reviews with not cooking the chicken before made less work which i enjoy more.

Delish!  I followed other reviewers' recommendations.  I sauteed the spinach (I used drained, thawed frozen) and mushrooms with a little garlic and butter (and a little salt).  I put that in the bottom of a square pyrex baking dish.  I put 4 bone-in skinless chicken thighs on top of that and poured the sauce over it.  I also added some pepper to the sauce.  Baked it all together for 30 minutes.  Sprinkled cheese on top and baked another 10 minutes.  This was great.  I might also try it in the slow cooker.

Rave reviews from the family.  Agree that its not necessary to cook the chicken first.  Also wondering if its necessary to saute the spinach ahead of time.  I used fresh spinach, sauteed it lightly in butter, but next time might just dampen it and lay it on the bottom.  Would add more mushrooms next time, and I only used half the mozzarrella cheese.

This was very good. I made a few changes due to allergies and just using what I had on hand but basically maintained the basics of the recipe. The biggest change I made was to bake the chicken raw in the sauce. I also used whole milk instead of half and half.

EXCELLENT!!! Followed a Reviewer's suggestions in how to cook the chicken and it came out absolutely perfect!  Made the sauce as per the recipe but I sauteed the (fresh) spinach and sliced mushrooms in a little butter. Placed them in a greased dish. Placed the uncooked breasts on top. Added the sauce, topped it off with the bacon bits - baked for 25 min at 350F. Removed from the oven, topped with shredded cheese and returned for 10 min at the same 350F.  Moist, FLAVOURFUL, - could serve it up at a formal dinner and be very proud of the results.

I just made this last night and it was a big hit w/ my family!  Adjusted a couple of things to reduce cooking time and richness of the sauce but it was still delicious and very easy.  I decreased half-&-half to 3 oz. and added 2 oz. of milk.  Also decreased Parmesan cheese to 1/4 cup and Mozzarella to 1 cup.  Used 16 oz. of frozen, cooked and drained spinach instead of canned and omitted bacon bits.  I cut 4 chicken breasts into 4 pieces each to reduce cooking time and baked for 30-35 minutes at 400'.  Sauce was delicious!!! Everyone went back for a second helping...so I'd definitely make this again!  Wasn't too salty at all (perhaps because I didn't use bacon).

My husband and I really like this.  I thinned out the sauce a bit, cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, added cooked pasta to it and put some panko bread crumbs on top with the bacon bits and cheese.  Next time I will try putting some cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes to give it a bit of a kick.  Thanks for another good recipe for my recipe box! :)

My husband loved this!  I used milk instead of the cream since I didn't have any.  Also, I used canned spinach...which I don't really like the taste of but it was all I had on hand.  It was still good despite that, I think it would be amazing with fresh or frozen spinach.  Very good and easy!

Great recipe!  I used frozen spinach and omitted the bacon bits (since I didn't have any on hand).  I also used a mix of chicken and shrimp.  The sauce is fantastic!!

Very good dish. The sauce made the spinach taste good. I didn't have any half anf half so I used butter cream instead and it worked perfectly.

This recipe was so yummy and so easy! I love it because I almost always have all of the ingredients on hand. I served it over angel hair pasta. The only thing I did differently was I added some white wine and some onion. I used chicken tenderloins and didn't prebake at all. I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes covered w/ foil, then for 10 min uncovered. Thanks for a great recipe!

So tasty and easy!  I chose to cook up the chicken in a skillet first as someone suggested and it was fast. I would definitely serve this over a bed of noodles or rice, or a nice loaf of french bread for soaking up the sauce.  I wouldn't be a substantial meal with out it.

OMG sooooo good.  I accidently put a 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/4 but still turned out really well.  Even my grandmother who does not like spinach liked this recipe.  I also used fresh spinach, don't like frozen at all.  The fresh cooked down while baking.  Also for a faster meal, cook chicken in the skillet and then bake.

I really expected to like this, but it was awful! There was WAY too much spinach, and there was too much sauce with not enough flavor. My boyfriend and I had a hard time making ourselves each it. It also does not look appetizing at all, with the piles of green spinach at the bottom. I will absolutely NOT make this again.

I cut up 2 chicken breasts into bite size pieces and cooked on the stove top with a bit of olive oil.  Next time I will use only 1 can of spinach...my kids and even my spinach-loving husband thought it was too much.  I omitted the bacon.  I served over penne.

I thought this was a simple and delicious meal (on a budget). I substituted the spinach and chicken with frozen, instead of fresh and canned. It still turned out great. I upped the number of mushrooms and added a bit more cream to the sauce to make it last longer. With how rich it was anyway, I probably could have gotten away with even more. All in all a great dish.

This was very delicious, and satisfying and filling when served over fettuccine.  I would have added some pepper and salt, in addition to the Italian seasoning.  Also, it turned out a little wet.  I thought that it would set more, but that didn't affect the taste, which was great!  I'll be making this again - it was easy and quick and my family really enjoyed it.

This recipe is so good and easy to make. I was in a hurry, therefore, I sauted the chicken on top of the stove. I didn't have spinach so I used green beans that I cooked for 10 min. I followed the recipe and we all enjoyed it served on top of rice. This was a very nice change to cook chicken.

I LOVED this recipe! It was very easy to make and absolutely delicious. The chicken was very tender and the sauce delicious! I did however make a few changes. I used fresh spinach, I cooked bacon and crumbled it, and I added tomatoes. served over pasta, the whole family loved it!

Easy, quick....huge compliments from my husband...who grew up with a gourmet chef as a mom!  My 5 year old daughter loved it too!  I followed the suggestions from a reviewer...fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms, and skipped step 1...but it had to bake a little longer.  Chicken came out moist and so oh yummy!  Leftovers tonight with angel hair pasta!

The spinach at the bottom makes for a unique base to the casserole.  I would definitely suggest skipping the first step as others have noted.  The chicken came out delicious and tender.

Got the thumbs up from my 6 year old! Took the advice of another member and didn't bake the chicken first. I actually forgot to put the bacon on and used less mozzarella cheese but it was still good. =)

This was a great recipe. I didnt have spinach so I omitted that, and my boyfriend doesnt care for it anyhow. I just sauted and onion and mushroom and cut the chicken in cubes and cooked that with some olive oil, salt & pepper. Used single serving cups and layered with egg noodles. Omitted the 1/2 & 1/2 and used milk and light sour cream. This is wonderful than you :)

I found this while looking for something to do with all the ingredients I had on hand. I made a few substitutions. Like fresh spinach for canned, garlic salt for minced garlic, and 4 cheese mexican for mozzarella. It's what I had on hand, and didn't want to go to the store. It turned out great anyway. I also pounded the chicken thin, and cooked in a little olive oil in a skillet. I was in a hurry and this seemed like a quick alternative to baking the chicken. It got compliments, and I really loved it.

DELISH! Saw all the comments for changes, but I try to make the recipes as written the first time to try them out as intended. This one is fantastic as-is. The Italian Seasoning was a little strong, but that may just be the brand I'm using. Tried it a second time with minor changes, came out the same. Used frozen spinach sted of canned, used canned mushrooms sted fresh. Next time I want to cube the chicken and maybe add some egg noodles? All around great recipe, the spinach really makes this a one dish meal.

Like the others, I skipped step one.  I used only smoked mozzarella (only needed one cup) and the flavor was unbelievable.  My boys, age 11 and 14, (who love "good" food) said the mixture of flavors was really delicious!  I used fat free half and half, lo-fat cream of mushroom soup, crimini mushrooms, and frozen spinach (which I cooked with the mushrooms), and it all worked terrific!  Thank you for a new favorite- and a great way to get more veggies into my kids.

This was very delicious. My family really enjoyed it. The only thing I changed with the recipe was seasoning the chicken with Poultry seasoning, lemon pepper, and cajun seasoning.

This was absolutely delicious! My 6-yr-old son even loved it.  I cooked bacon on the stove (4 or 5 slices), set the bacon aside, and then cooked the chicken and garlic in the bacon grease.  I then sauteed the fresh spinach (one bag) and fresh mushrooms (sliced portabello) in the chicken and bacon fat. It tasted like something from a fancy restaurant.  I served over angel hair pasta with french bread and salad.  I can't wait to make it again. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I made a few changes here and there based on other users' reviews. Next time I make this dish I will use less spinach and I think I'll mix everything together instead of layering. But that's just me. Overall a very tasty dish. Would also be good as a dip, I think!

This is my review, that I have ever made on a recipe, but I just wanted to share a little of what I did.  It was an after thought but I still did it. Which was to add a fresh sliced tomato to the top of the Casserole, then sprinkled a little more shredded Colby cheese on top of the tomato.  It added color and flavor.  I also used cream of chicken and I layered Half spinach and half broccoli to the bottom layer. I was really good.  The chicken I pounded to about 1/2 inch thickness.  It was so tender. Great recipe!!   It is a keeper!!  Thanks

My family didn't love this one. The flavors were fine, but there seemed to be a LOT of spinach in comparison to everything else, it sort of overpowered the dish. The sauce was also a little blah, not gross, but just lacking in some oomph. Might make it again, but with modifications listed by other reviewers. Good enough, but not great.

This is so yummy I used the advice of ally99 and this turned out super yummy.  I did use a whole chicken cut and skinned to make it a little more cost effective.  Next time I think I'll double the spinach.  I also used whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2.

I did this the same, only substituting smoked gouda for the mozzarella on the top--which took it over the edge into divine.  I ate ALL the leftovers.  And I NEVER eat leftovers.  Yum, yum, yum!

This is my first time leaving a review.  I just couldn't not give this 5 stars!!  I made a few minor changes including adding crushed red pepper as I love a creamy/spicy combo.  I also only used only 3 breasts (cooked and cubed) and added to white sauce and it turned into an amazing thick and chunky sauce topper for any pasta!!  My friend owns an Italian restaurant in NYC and he LOVED this recipe.  Really nice presentation as well.  SUCH a keeper!!!

I made the recipe with some pre-cooked chicken I had on hand, otherwise followed it to a tee.  I would saute' the veggies first as others had suggested, because while the flavors were all great, it seemed...disseparate when I served it. The ingredients didn't meld together while they cooked.  Would have been a 5 star had I first sauteed the veggies and garlic in some butter.

I used chicken breast tenders and frozen spinach (thawed both first) for this recipe and skipped the first step. I baked for 30 minutes at 350 and served it over angel hair pasta. It turned out great! I had leftovers for lunch the next day and it was still yummy. Thanks for a keeper!

This is now my best dish. I modified it by using frozen creamed spinach. I also cooked the chicken in the skillet in the sauce with all the mushrooms, spinach, etc. Then I baked it, like the original recipe.

Will make many more times. Followed others suggestions and sauteed fresh spinach & mushrooms w/ butter, garlic & wine.  Put that on the bottom of pan, added raw chicken (next time I will dice first) sauce on top and then topped with real bacon pieces (made on the stove top).  Cooked at 350 for 30 covered, took out, added mozzarella and cooked another 10 uncovered.  Fantastic and lots of flavor.

Well I pretty much butchered the recipe and my picky husband STILL liked it! I am totally shocked. It was very good and very flavorful. There is only 2 of us so I cut some of the ingredients down. I am vegetarian so I cooked my hubs up a chicken breast and threw a boca ckn patty on it for me then added the sauce and veggies. Kudos!

I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again! I was skeptical if my husband would because of the spinach but he went back for 3rds! I did use frozen spinach instead of canned. I also boiled the chicken first. Then I cut the chicken into cubes, mixed the chicken with the cream sauce and added it all together on top of the spinach. I did not add mushrooms to my side as I do not like them. My husband had a large helping of mushrooms on his and he loved it. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My family loves this recipe.  I used a bag fresh spinach instead of canned, skim milk instead of half and half, and made my own bacon bits.  It was just fine.  I also doubled it and put it in a 9x13 pan.

OMG, this was excelent! I did modify it slightly, as was suggested by others to precooking the chicken stovetop rather than baking it, also I used low fat cheeses and mushroom soup to make it a bit lighter, it was fantastic!  I have been ordered to make this agian or else!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

I made this last night.  The only change I made was that I used fresh spinach instead of canned.  I thought the soup topping was way to heaving.  It was just ok for us.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband LOVES this recipe.  I follow the recipe except I exclude the mushrooms and I use the grated Parmesan from a can. I actually bake each chicken breast in a personal sized baking dish that way each serving has the same amount of spinach mixture etc.  Very full rich flavor.  If you don't like spinach you will not like this recipe.  Would be even better with fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

Followed suggestion to saute veggies first in butter and place chicken on top, then add sauce. Also used real bacon crumbled on top. Very moist and the flavors were very rich. I used fat free half and half and used Cream of Mushroom and garlic soup, omitting the minced garlic altogether. Btw, I forgot to put the 2 cups of shredded mozzerella on top and it was still delicious!

Used 6 large (Costco) frozen chicken breasts put over a bunch of spinach and a cup of sliced fresh mushrooms and put in the oven while I prepared the sauce. I used a large can of mushroom soup double d everything else, but used a pkg of Italian Seasoning and baked for 45 minutes. Then put the mozzarella cheese on top and baked for 15 more minutes. Microwaved  fresh crispy bacon to serve on the side, because not everyone in the family is not thrilled with bacon, but all the family used it on top. Everyone praised the meal!. Thanks for the recipe! Next time I might prepare some egg noodles to put the extra sauce on top of.

So good.  As other's have suggested, I didn't brown the chicken before hand--other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Who'd have thought this was the way to get the kids to enjoy spinach?  Great Recipe.  Thanks for sharing

Wonderful! Easy I always have these ingredients on hand so thats even better. I seasoned the chicken with S&P and garlinc power and baked it. I also cooked my baccon, set it to the side and made my sauce in the drippings. Real fresh baccon is the way to go!!!

This was delicious! I used the canned spinach as it called for- will use frozen next time as others have done as I think it would have tasted "fresher" with the frozen- and sauteed it with the mushrooms. I also cut back some of the fat by using 1% milk. I baked the uncooked chicken with the sauce and spinach mixture in the oven at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. It turned out so tasty and the chicken was very juicy. Will definitely make again!

Great!  I used a bag of fresh spinach and baked a few breasts for the recipe.  I didn't have cream, but used a can of evaporated milk.  No bacon bits but chopped a few pieces of turkey bacon and crisped them up for the top.  Made it ahead and put it in the fridge for tonight.  400 degrees for about 35 minutes--last 15 uncovered.  My family loved it!!!

Wow!!! I've never actually had this dish before, so I'm extra pleased at how amazing it turned out. I followed other reviewer's suggestions by using fresh spinach and sauteing it with the mushrooms & some butter, lining the bottom of the pan with it and then putting the sauce, *raw* chicken, sauce, & cheese on in that order and cooking at 350 for about 35-40 minutes. Thank you so much! I can't wait to make this for my friends and family!

OMG this recipe is so good! I tweaked it to make it my own making a wild mushroom rice pilaf and putting that at the bottom of the baking pan to make it more of a casserole. Than I baked the chicken only for like 10 minutes so I was assured it would cook through. I also sauteed the spinach which was frozen from a bag with sliced mushrooms and 3 cloves of sliced garlic. Turned out amazing!

Really liked this as did my kids.  Do not use canned spinach EVER and do not use canned mushrooms EvER. Cooked bacon and then sauted chicken in some of the bacon grease with garlic salt. Put chicken aside and sauted muschrooms ,garlic and green onion in butter and added white wine then added the spinach (whole bag) till it reduced a little and squirted some lemon on it.  dumped it all on chicken and diced up a little tomato for color and threw that in too.  Bake for 30 and tossed some mozz cheese and baked till cheese turn golden.  Served over bow ties and nuke some green beans.  I did use Half and Half cuz I had some but I would use non fat milk to save on calories next time.

Not bad but the canned soup makes this a little too salty and gives the casserole an aftertaste.

Boyfriend and I had this for dinner tonight, first bite and he said we definitely need to have this again! that's a lot coming from him, he's usually a pretty picky eater. absolutely delicious, I followed the advice of other reviews and it turned out very well, nice and creamy and very flavorful. I'm a big fan of casseroles and this definitely was not a disappointment.

I made a healthier version that did not suffer at all!  I'm a firm believer in fresh is better so I used a whole bag of fresh spinach and fried 4 strips of bacon.  To avoid immediate cardiac arrest, I used skim milk instead of half and half, only 1 cup of mozzarella, and Healthy Request mushroom soup.  It was delicious!  If you really want to cut calories, you could even omit the bacon and mozzarella because the rest of the ingredients were so flavorful together.  Still no substitute for butter though! :)  I also skipped the first two steps (no need to cook the chicken first) and started by sauteing the mushrooms and spinach in a little butter.  I then mixed in the other ingredients with a splash of white wine.  I arranged the chicken in a casserole dish and dumped the sauce over the top, followed by the crumbled bacon.  I baked at 400 for 25 minutes covered, then topped with mozz and baked 10 minutes more uncovered.  I would call this a chicken bake instead of a casserole, but I will make it over and over.

The ingredient changes I made was to use fresh spinach instead of canned and used cream intead of half and half.  I also mixed mixed all the ingredients together except for the moz cheese and cut the chicken up before baking it.  I then paired it with linguine because it needs either a pasta or rice to go with it.  When making it I didn't know if it would be "saucy" enough but it was just right.  My family really liked it except for my 11 year old but he can be pretty picky.  I will be making it again.

Great recipe! Instead of cooking it in the oven at 400 and then again for another 20 minutes, I reduced the temperature to 375, elimated the first baking step, as I felt this would be overdoing it. I popped this in the oven for 45 minutes at 375 and it was perfect! I also used real bacon instead of bacon bits. Served this with rice and broccoli. All in all a lovely meal, thank  you :)

I love this recipe. It's also in my "Somersize" diet. I cooked it for company last night and served over angel hair pasta. I substituted frozen spinach for canned and followed an earlier review and simply sauteed the spinach and mushrooms with butter and garlic, placed in dish, then layered cubed, raw chicken over it, then mixed the sauce over the top of it all. I then baked at 350 for 30 minutes (until the chicken was done), then layered sliced fresh mozzarella on top and baked for another 20 minutes. Really, only 10 minutes would suffice. The ONLY reason I baked it so long is that our friends were running late. But the mozzarella lightly burned on top and looked as delicious as it tasted.

Excellent. Substituted frozen spinach for canned, omitted mushrooms (b/c we don't like them), used heavy cream instead of half-and-half since it's what I had on hand. Just a really good recipe, easy to make ahead and just bake before serving. Thanks!

This was soooo good! I sauteed the mushrooms and spinach with garlic powder and salt and pepper and a splash of white wine before putting in the baking dish, and i also added a splash of white wine to the sauce and used real bacon for the bacon bits. I cooked everything in the same pan inviting all the ingredients to the flavor party! I also cooked the chicken almost all the way in a little of the bacon fat in the saute pan and with grill seasoning and made sure both sides were very brown for extra flavor.

I made this dish and it was really good. I added a few onions to the minced garlic, and served it with bow tie pasta.  It was a big hit with my family. I will be making this again.

Used the ingredients as listed, but mixed as per other reviews.  I used cooked turkey I had in the freezer and 2 pkgs of frozen chopped spinach, squeezed dry.  I haven't heard raves like this for a while.

This was yummy! I served in on top of a bed of angel hair pasta. I added an extra cup of Cream of Mushroom soup and substituted frozen spinach instead of canned spinach. I added a little more water to the sauce to thin it out a little. Over all this recipe is simple and tasty.

I prepared this using the tweaks suggested by "vicsgarden" (thank-you!) and both my husband and I were very pleased with the outcome. I used 2 boxes of frozen for the spinach (may try sauteing my own "baby spinach" leaves next time, per other suggestions...) and cooked for 30 minutes prior to adding the cheese and 15 minutes after. Got wonderfully "oozy" and golden brown! Chicken stayed tender and moist enough even for "the hubbs" who normally wouldn't think of choosing white meat. Thanks for this recipe.

This recipe was really good. I did take the advice of some of the other reviews though. I used fresh spinach and instead of mushrooms I used onions. Instead of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken.(My family doesn't like mushrooms) I used rotissorie chicken that was left over and it added a great flavor and I got 2 meals out of one bird. My son just doesn't eat vegies but ate the spinach in this recipe.I will make this again

I really enjoyed my altered version of this recipe.  I cooked 3 slices of bacon then sauteed the chicken in the bacon grease.  Then, I set it aside and sauteed the spinach and mushrooms.  I used a bag of baby spinach leaves and that was enough for me!  As others said placing the browned chicken on the spin/mush mix then topping the whole thing with the sauce seemed to keep the chicken moist.  I baked it in a convection oven uncovered for close to 40 min.(total) at 350.  However, my chicken breasts were v. thick.  I also used 1% milk, about half the parmesan cheese and only a sprinkling of mozz. on top the last 10 minutes.

I chopped the chicken and sauted with garlic and olive oil. Then slightly sauted a 9oz bag of fresh spinach with 8oz mushrooms in olive oil. Then layered as stated. I used lime juice as I didnt have lemon on hand. Served over egg noodles. Was a great quick dish with wonderful flavor. Maybe next time add in some asparagus.

If I could give it a 4.5 I would.  I don't usually give out 5's.  It was very good, did not add bacon, that sounded odd.  Tried it with chicken that was marinated in garlic marinade, next time I will use plain chicken.  It was a little salty with the marinade.  Very good, will make again!

This was a no fail recipe. I followed many of the comments suggestions and it turned out perfectly. Even without taking some of the time-saving suggestions, the recipe didn't need any alterations. This will be a staple meal at our house. Thanks for the recipe!

Made as is (except I also used fresh spinach), it was good, but could have been better if the chicken had more flavor. It wasn't really enough time for the chicken to take up the sauce, so it was pretty bland. I would recommend seasoning the chicken before cooking. Otherwise it was pretty good. Sauce was excellent...

Love this recipe!!  My fiance had NO IDEA he was eating spinach...so I like it even more :)Like everyone, I tweaked little things here & there - like reduced fat soup & only 2 pieces of bacon.  I doubled the garlic because we LOVE garlic in my house!  We only used 2 chicken breasts but made the whole amount of sauce and served with a side of pasta.  Sooo yummy!  I'm sharing this one with my family!!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Super yummy!  I lightened the orginal recipe by making my own bacon bits with turkey bacon, using fat free half and half and 99% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  I also used fresh spinach as others had recommended, and browned the chicken breasts before baking.  I cooked it at 400 degress for 30 minutes.  In my opinion this is definately a keeper!

Delicious. I used the canned spinach because I had some on hand but I can see how other reviewers used frozen or fresh. Either way, this was simple and yummy. I did cut up the chicken and mixed garlic w/ the spinach. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic, I usually make the recipe as is before altering as I feel that rating it based upon my tweeking is simply unfair.  Wow, was this delicious.  My teenage son even ate the spinach without any complaining.  I'm still in shock.  This recipe would be delicous even if the spinach were omitted. We loved it, thanks for sharing.

I browned the chicken in a pan and set it aside. In the same pan, I sauteed fresh baby spinach and mushrooms. I also feel that the bacon was sort of "lost" in all the other igredients. I served this with the "Brazilian Rice" from this site. Very good!

4 Stars for the original recipe- it was good and pretty easy.  I followed the suggestion of sauteing the mushrooms and spinach together, and then placing the raw chicken over the bed of spinach, covering with sauce, and then baking. It was absolutely delicious, and much quicker, too. My husband loved it, my 15 month old son loved it, too. I served it over rice, along with  baked green beans.

Extremely good and filling... My modifications skipped step #1 (as recommended above).  Also, I sauteed onions and added it on top, and didn't think the bacon was necessary at all (didn't even taste it-- wasted calories and fat).  Absolutely loved it, though.  Definitely a new favorite!

I liked this very much, although it is VERY rich. I used frozed spinach because I can't stand canned and drained it very well. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated. Next time, I might add some chopped onion and sautee in the butter with the garlic. I would bring this to a family that just had a baby or even make for company! It's very good! Thanks!

this recipe is good.  it gets 4 stars b/c it calls for canned spinach.  i don't know what i was thinking when i used the canned spinach - must have repressed those childhood memories of how bad it is.  anyway, i will make this again, but with fresh spinach.  i also sauteed chicken breast chunks(and 1/2 onion) in the bacon grease - it really adds great flavor.

This recipe was not very good. My husband took 1 bite and that was all she wrote. This had way too much spinach and overall the taste of the sauce wasn't very good. I was looking for a different flavor. I think the cream of mushroom didn't do it any good either.

I have no complaints. I was so scared we wouldn't like it because it is something different than we usually eat, but it was very good. I had left over asparagus and used that to supplement the spinach and it was really good.

I thought this was just ok but my boyfriend loved it so I will give it 4 stars!  I would recommend baking it in a larger pan or drain the juices because it was too watery for me.  Will probably make again for my boyfriend.

I enjoyed this recipe, but made several alterations, based on others reviews.  I reduced the garlic to two cloves, added about 1/3 cup white wine (I poured it right out of the bottle) to fresh spinach and mushrooms to saute, and another 1/4 cup white wine to sauce while cooking.  I used 1/4 cup cream, and 1/4 cup 2% milk instead of half and half.  Instead of baking the chicken, I cut into strips, and sauteed covered, until done.  I had no mozerella cheese, and substituted with gouda cheese (not smoked, very mild). I also used fresh parsley and chives (left over from other recipes) in place of italian seasoning. To add more color, I also diced one fresh tomato, and added the the mixture before baking.  Delightful!!!!!!!!!

Great casserole!  I gave it 4 star instead of 5 because I did alter the recipe as some other suggested.  I sauteed fresh spinach and the mushrooms in butter ahead of time and lined the bottom of the baking dish.  Then topped with uncooked chicken breasts and the sauce baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  I was cooking for 2, but did not reduce the amount of sauce just the number of chicken breasts.  It's great on egg noodles!

This recipe is DELICIOUS.  But it cooks WAY down.  Definitely serve over linguini or some kind of pasta, the "casserole" title is misleading.

Yummy! Not a healthy dish, but a very good one! I browned the chicken in olive oil instead of baking, I used frozen spinich squeezed very dry and I used turkey bacon. Excellent dish, will make again- maybe fat free half and half next time...

We loved this!!  It is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had!  I made minor changes.  Browned the chicken in olive oil instead baking in the oven (yuck).  After melting the butter I sautéed the garlic and added onion, sliced into rings.  Then I added all the sacue ingredients to the garlic & onions.  I used milk instead of half & half.  Then I sautéed the mushrooms with a little olive oil in the same pan I used for browning the chicken.  Then I added a bag of FRESH spinach and poured a tiny bit of chicken broth over the mushrooms & spinach and cooked it for about a minute until it was soft.  Put the spinach mixture on the bottom of the baking dish, topped with chicken and then poured the sauce over all of it.  I put fresh shredded parmesean cheese on it instead of mozzarella.  Cooked it at 350 for 30 minutes.  Probably will cook only 20-25 min next time.  So yummy, it was unbelievable!!  I served it over rice.

I would have given this recipe five stars but not everyone thought so.  The women loved it.  The men said it was okay and I could serve it once every two or three months.  I added two extra chicken breasts to cover everyone so I doubled the recipe....except for the spinach.  I used two frozen and one can because I didn't have enough of the other.  I rinsed both well and squeezed dry.  It came out perfect.  Served with creamy chicken rice, green beans, and bread.  Plenty of sauce left over.  Rich enough, I didn't need the extra chicken breasts but now we have plenty for lunch tomorrow!  Expensive to make but it will be a nice change.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavors just did not work for most of my family members. Honestly I think it was the canned spinach which I never use. If I am bold enough to try this again I will definitely use fresh spinach and use less of it.

This recipe is so awesome and very easy to make. I cooked chicken tenders instead of the breasts in a pan wih o/oil and I did lower the fat content of the recipe by using fat free half and half and 98% ff cream of mushroom soup. Also, I used reduced fat mozz. cheese. I did use the bacon bits and added a little crunch by putting about 2 handfuls of Durkee onions the last 7-9 mins of baking. My kids were upset because there were no leftovers. They now like spinach! Finally!

This recipe is fantastic!!  I used cod instead of chicken.  I also omitted the mushrooms.  I did use canned spinach and thought it was great.  This recipe will impress dinner guests for sure :)

Loved this! Used 8oz of mushrooms instead of 4 and less cheese on top- 1 cup instead of 2. We ate it by itself instead of serving on pasta, just to keep it low carb.

Very easy recipe to follow.  I planned the meal but my hubby had the day off so he ended up making it.  We LOVED it and wouldn't change one thing about it.

Tastes good, looks good and all kids ate it! I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any and used whole milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2, finally I cut the breasts into thin pieces and only used 2 whole breasts (4 thin slices), I also took the advice to saute the spinach with onion and garlic before hand. I only wish I had used fresh spinach, all I had on hand was frozen. I served it over a thick slice of french bread for a nice variation. I was shocked when my 1 1/2 yr old ate the entire plate!

I have made this three times and my guests love this recipe. No one could tell it was spinach with all the creamy mushrooms and rich flavors.  I also loved it because I could easily make it for a crowd (though a little pricy) and make it ahead of time.  Be sure to squeeze the liquid out of the canned spinach.

Made the adjustments as recommended by VICSGARDEN.  Everything turned out great.  I would however add about 5 minutes to the cook time.  Other than, everything was spot on.

I took advice from other individual's comments and didn't bake the chicken but sauted it in a pan for about 5 minutes total before putting the casserole together.  It was very good and I will make this again in a heart beat!

This meal was delicious, and was great for leftovers.  I doubled the recipe, which worked out good, because I put cooked egg noodles in the bottom of the pan before covering it with everything else.  Too much spinach for me, even though I'm a fan of spinach.  I bought a bag of frozen spinach and used the whole thing, although it still wasn't doubled the amount of spinach.  Next time I will use probably half the amount of spinach.  Everything else was great!  and the noodles were a must.  I put the cheese on during the last 10 minutes, and broiled for the last 2 mintues to make the cheese brown and crispy.  I also didn't add bacon, because I didn't think it would go well with the dish, and it still turned out great. I will be making this again!

really amazing. i definitely took the advice of others and used whole milk instead of half&half.

also took the advice of cooking the bacon, then using the bacon grease to cook the chicken.

This dish was delicious; very rich. I followed one reviewers advice and sauteed the mushrooms & spinach in butter, and I added a bit of garlic powder, too. Will probably make for company, soon. It is very rich, though, so pair with steamed veggies or something else light.

Fast, easy and tasty.  I used frozen spinach, 2 huge chicken breasts each split in half just pan fry in a little evo, canned mushrooms, cream of chicken/mushroom soup, 2 nice thick slices of good smokey bacon and only half the cheese on top and it came out great. Served w/ thin pasta on side to pick up the sauce. Even Mr. Picky liked it.

D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S! Took the others advice on skipping the first step.....and real bacon bits a must! It was the perfect meal for a frigid winter night. I plan on using it for entertaining too! It's a keeper!

Four stars with original.  I sauted the chicken for 7 minutes in olive oil first (much more flavor).  Then, I sauted the mushrooms in some butter and olive oil.  I used fresh spinach and added it to the last few minutes of the mushrooms.  Put that in the casserole dish.  Added the chicken then added the sauce as directed and baked.  GREAT!!!

My boyfriend said it was the best pasta! I'm really happy with the way it turned out. I took many of the suggestions but also changed a little here and there. I made 7 bacon strips on the stove (we love bacon!) Used the grease to cook the chicken (bite-sized pieces) and added the garlic. I cooked the chicken all the way through. In a bowl I made the sauce. Kept the sauce pretty close the recipe but added extra parmesean cheese (about 3/4 cup, 2% milk and mixed a cup of motzerella. Then I mixed the cooked chicken into the sauce. Cooked the spinich (a bag and a half of fresh spinich) and mushrooms (6 ounces) in the bacon and chicken juices, then added it to the bottom of the 9x9 pan. At first, you'll think it's WAY too much spinich, but it cooks down to very little. Added the chicken and sauce mixture, then the bacon, then the second cup of the motzerella cheese. Cooked it in the oven at 400 for about 23 mintues. I wouldn't change anything from what I did.

This was easy and yummy. My changes included using frozen spinach instead of canned. I shredded the chicken because I thought it would be easier for my kids. And left out the bacon because we didn't have any. It was still very good.

I LOVED this recipe.  I added diced onion and then layered cooked rice in between the spinach and mushroom mix and the chicken.  Also, instead of baking the chicken before, I just sliced the breasts in half and layred them.  Will definitely be making this many more times!

I skipped the first step, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, omitted the bacon bits, and it was delicious.  Be sure to drain the spinach well or it will be soupy.

This was alright. I think it is more like 3 and 1/2 stars. I was expecting more flavor. I did skip the first step like the other reviews have suggested. Overall it was a nice cozy meal and the presentation was pretty but I think it is missing some pizazz.

This recipe is fantastic!  I didn't make any changes except the way to make chicken.  I used 4 pieces of raw chicken breast and put the sauce over it. Then I cooked it at 350 for 1.25 hrs.  The chicken was moist and you could cut it with a fork.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Has a great flavor! I added onion and sauteed the mushrooms and spinach though. Next time I wont use 2 cans of spinach..way too much and i'll probably use frozen instead of canned spinach, make more of the sauce and add penne pasta to it.

This was really good.  I tried not to alter too much, but did add cooked penne to the bottom, used fresh spinach, and had to use cubed browned prosciutto because I didn't have any bacon.  Otherwise, I left it the same, great recipe, the whole family loved it.

I made this recipe last minute for some friends who just had a baby, and they absolutely loved it. It's become a big hit for my husband, who normally hates mushrooms. Thanks for this great recipe!

Great recipe....I made a couple of changes. I sauted the mushrooms in the butter and garlic to reduce the amount of moisture and used one bag of fresh spinach. Awesome flavor! Thank you for sharing!

This was just OK. In readings the reviews I did as others suggested used frozen spinach instead of canned and skipped step one. I was expecting a better taste considering the ratings. I won't be making this one again.

Bravo! Wonderful and easy recipe. I did make a few changes. I boiled chicken thighs (personal preference). I sauteed mushroom and garlic in butter. Then added 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream chicken (doubled the recipes). Added half and half, 2 cups of shredded mozzarella,  chopped chicken, and folded in 2 10 oz packages of frozen spinach (defrosted and drained). Topped casserole with crumbled bacon and 2 cups of shredded mozzarella. Thanks for a great recipe. VWR

this recipe was good but it did have some problems. i found that 1/4 cup butter was WAAAAAAAAAAAY too much because after i finished baking this dish, there was a thick layer of oil on top that was less than appetizing. another problem with this recipe is that the amount of italian seasoning called for is too much. the dish tasted medicinal because of it! i would cut it down to 1 tsp so that the herbs don't overwhelm the dish. i made it a second time with these changes and the dish was delicious. it was perfect served with some steamed rice. thanks for the recipe!

This was ok. I tried to simplify it as much as possible. I used frozen and thawed spinach that I mixed with sauteed mushrooms and seasoned with garlic salt and garlic powder. I cooked bacon in a skillet and set aside then cooked cubed chicken and 3 cloves of garlic in the same skillet. For the sauce I omitted the wine and used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, I also used milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2. I layered the chicken over the spinach and then the soup mix. I topped with the cheese and bacon covered and backed for 30 min at 350 and then uncovered and baked for another 15 min. It was decent but I won't make again.

I just made this today for the family and my 8-year-old-vegetarian-child had 4 servings!! Yes, she decided to be a vegetarian 2 weeks ago, but I think this dish broke her streak!  I wanted a one dish meal so I added 8 oz of boiled rotini noodles to the bottom of a 13 x 9 lasagna pan. I doubled the sauce ingredients and added 3/4 c of Chardonnay instead of the lemon juice. I didn't have any bacon bits or mushrooms to add.  I layered the ingredients as directed except I used raw cubed chicken breast. I cooked the whole thing at 350 for 1 1/2 hours (I fell asleep). The casserole was covered with foil for the first 45 mins. The whole dish came out bubbly and golden brown! I'll make this again and will probably add some chopped red onion.

Husband stated it looked questionable but then gave it a chance.  However, we both found it to be lacking in flavor and the chicken was overcooked.  Very disappointed!  Will not make again.

This sauce was amazing!  I used skim milk instead of half and half, wilted some baby spinach with garlic for the base layer, cut up the chicken and browned in a pan, and left out the bacon bits.  One of my new favorites!  Next time I'll either try shrimp or use some small chicken breasts instead of cutting it up.

WONDERFULL! I actually added Italian seasoned bread crumbs to the top of it before I put it in the oven, cooked it, and then put the cheese on top of that, and cooked for 10 more minutes. GLORIOUS!

This was very good except that my husband thought it was a little to salty. Next time, I will use the low sodium can of soup to help cut down on the saltiness. Otherwise, I took a lot of suggestions from other people and it turned out beautifully; a definite keeper again! Thanks!

This recipe is alright. A lot of flavors and textures, but we could really have done without the canned spinach. It ruined it for me. Maybe substitute with a nice spinach salad on the side instead. The sauce was great with the chicken, though!

This recipe was delicious. Only thing I changed was I cooked the chiken while I prepared everything else and then put it all together. I used can spinach couldn't taste a different but will try it with fresh next time just to see. This one is definitely a keeper!!

I wanted something dfferent for dinner and this was it! Turned out really really great! Can't wait to eat the leftovers! My modifications were as follows: I used about 12 ounces of fresh spinach and sauteed it with butter, garlic and olive oil. Next time, I'll use more spinach, probably about 20 ounces so there is spinach on each bite. I cubed the raw chicken and put it right on top of the spinach. I did not precook the chicken. I doubled the sauce mixture because I served it with penne pasta and wanted enough to cover the pasta.  Probably didn't need to double the sauce, there was a good bit that I didn't use. I cooked it covered on 350 for about 30-45 minutes, then removed the cover, added the cheese and broiled it. Served over Penne with crusty bread and it was fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious. I did as other reviewers stated and cooked the chicken with the sauce instead of cooking it first separately. This is super quick and delicious. I managed to make this in about 35 minutes. I used half the Spinach. It came out perfect.

This is a very good recipe.  I would highly recommend using fresh spinach (I will be next time) and sautee that with the fresh mushrooms in butter with some garlic.  I think that would make this good recipe GREAT.  Although it is called casserole, I'm not quite feeling that one....next time I might try cubing the chicken for more of a casserole feel.  PS...I did not cook the chicken first as suggested by another reviewer.

This was good, though there are two changes I would make:

1. Only use one can of spinach
2. Half the garlic

I will admit, this combo sounded a little strange to me but it was well worth it! I did make a few minor additions and it was gone before I even had leftovers to put up.

Not that it needs another positive review, but this was fabulous! Stuck to the recipe to the most part, used fresh spinach ,added white wine, and did not use lemon, because I forgot. I aslo suateed the chicken lightly and did not bake it as directed. All in all it was a huge sucess! Thanks for the new recipe!

This recipe the first time i made it was fantastic.  My husband brought it to work and a friend of his who is a chef said that it was terrific.  The second time i made this i think i messed up the sauce because it didnt turn out as good. Thank you very much for the recipe!

Okay, I would rate this a 5, but I took other reviewers suggestions and changed it just a tad. I sauted to mushrooms and spinach then placed the raw chicken breasts on top. Poured the sauce over all and baked for approx 20 minutes. I then pulled out of over added the cheese on top and put back in for an additional 10 minutes. My husband who claimed not to be very hungry, ate three servings. Next time I make, I will cut up chicken, double sauce and serve over pasta. This is a keeper.

This makes an attractive dish. I ended up using what I had so I had to adapt. I used frozen bagged spinach and like another reviewer I sauteed the spinach and mushrooms for a few minutes to get rid of some of the liquid. I sprayed with non-stick spray a 9x13 pan and spread the mushroom/spinach. I had about 2 chicken breasts. I cut this into 1/2-1" cubes, I sauteed these for about 3 minutes until nearly cooked through and spread them atop the spinach/mushroom layer. Then I used mushroom soup, milk, garlic, butter, italian seasoning and parmesan cheese to make the sauce because that is what was available. Smelled great. I poured this on top of the mushroom/spinach/chicken and then took a fork and pulled the sauce through a bit. I added the mozzarella and baked. Awesome!

This dish is definitely restuarant quality.  It looked beautiful after it baked and was SO impressive.  I used 10 oz. of frozen chopped spinach and layered half on the bottom of the pan and topped each chicken breast with some as well. I left out mushrooms as I don't like them and served over wide egg noodles.  Next time, I may reduce the amount of spinach for my own taste.  Otherwise perfect!!

Love this recipe! I substituted with 1% milk and a little half and half. Also, using fresh spinach, instead of canned was excellent. Using Brummel and Brown  margarine made it a little less rich. Excellent flavor with little effort!!

Very good recipe.  I followed the other suggestions and sauteed the mushrooms and spinach with a little wine before putting in the oven.  I also cut up my chicken and boiled it, then baked the dish for 25 minutes at 400deg.  The sauces is excellent.  We can't do milk and I had success making this with soy milk. :)

This was very  good.  Next time I'll use less Italian seasoning for sure - it was a bit too much. I used fresh baby spinach (sauted first) and home made cream of mush. soup (yuck to the canned stuff) and did NOT cook the chicken prior. It's a keeper.

Use less Italian seasoning.  Otherwise, the rosemary tends to be overpowering.

This recipe was very simple and basic to follow.  Although, I left out the lemon because it kind of gave the casserole a bit of sourness which I didn't like.  I also added broccoli and green beans to the casserole.  This is the order of the layers from bottom to top: mushroom, sauce, broccoli, chicken, green beans, sauce, mozzarella, and finally bacon bits.

Followed the advice of some others - substituted half-and-half for fat free sour cream and some white wine, and omitted the bacon - turned out lovely and my luncheon was a success!

Good stuff!  The changes I made were to cut the butter in half with olive oil, in which I sauteed the (pounded and seassoned) chicken breasts.  I added a little more olive oil and then continued on.  I served over spaghetti noodles because that's what I had on hand but it would be great on pasta or rice.  The only change I will make next time is to half the canned spinach or maybe use frozen.

Mmm, good. Boyfriend loves the sauce. Great over the rice.  Spinach really cooks down, so follow the recipe or add more.

This was really salty, and the spinach was a little too much. It was ok, but I think I might try a different but similar recipe.

Good but chicken lacked flavor. After reading the recipe I thought the chicken will get its flavors from the sauce so I decided not to do too much to the chicken prior to baking it. I just sprinkled olive oil and salt on it yet this did not help. Maybe next time, I'll flatten the breast, coat with seasoned flour and cook a little less than 20 min. The chicken was juicy and the sauce was wonderful! Just wish I followed my intuition about seasoning the chicken. *I always use low sodium soups and no salt added butter - so I added quite a bit of salt to the sauce and it still came out needing more salt. When adding sauce to the spinach and mushrooms, it can turn bland when all mixed together. Just a warning =) Happy cooking!

This was really quite good.  Rich and creamy but still tasted fairly healthy!  I used fresh spinach - I just prefer the appearance of it over canned (canned looks so mushy!).  Also, I left out the mushrooms as I was making this for kids. Nice recipe.

This was so delicious. I used frozen spinach, cooked according to package directions and drained. I did not have half and half, so used 1% milk. I grilled the chicken then cut into bite sized pieces. We don't eat pork so I used turkey bacon. Next time I will half or omit the butter, 40gms of fat kind of freaks me out. Using milk and cutting out the butter will make this healthier. Oh, and I used provolone chz slices in place of the mozzerella. Yummy!

Love this recipe.  Not a big fan of spinach, so we left that out and it was still wonderful!  VERY heavy meal...suggest not making it on a warm day.

Wonderful!  My husband said, "This is a KEEPER"  I used frozen spinach and I thawed it with warm water first.  I ended up without mushroom soup so I used a heavy white sauce to substitute for that and it was STILL excellent.

This came out really good.  I did not put spinach in the dish though.  I bought two cans of greens beans mixed with potatoes.  Since my husband is not to fond of spinach I decided to put another vegetable in it.  Also I did not bother to put in the mushrooms.  I enjoyed it.

This was pretty good but, a little too cheesey for my taste.  I would cut the mozzerella to 1 cup next time.  I used frozen spinach instead of canned and the bottom part seemed a little soupy.  Maybe I didn't drain the spinach enough.  It was tasty though and, I'll make it again!

I made this recipe with 6 pieces of chicken breast, 8 ounces of mushroom, 3 cups of mozzarella cheese in 3qt dish.  I didn't have bacon bits, but I did have some pork belly. So I put the pork on the top of the chicken breast to bake at the beginning. It was really good. 

I had one chicken breast with the sauce left. So I sliced it up the next day, also sliced up two portbella mushroom, and added 1/4 half and half, to make florentine sauce to serve over fettuccini for me and my hubby. It was excellent.

We really liked this recipe.  I had to substitute the half and half with milk.  And if you do that I would suggest adding a little bit extra milk, to make the sauce a little thinner.  I would also suggest covering the baking dish with aluminum foil while cooking to avoid the mozz. from turning brown and hard.  I too used frozen spinach instead of the canned.  We served it atop rotini, and it was yummy.  Very simple, very easy.  Thanks!

the blend of flavors was wonderful!! My husband loved it! I used frozen spinach.  I doubled and sauteed the mushrooms and added sauteed onions as well. I cut the italian seasoning in half as previously suggested. I used milk instead of cream and cut the butter in 1/2. I was trying to make it a little healthier. After cooking the seasoned chicken in a skillet I cut it up into larger chunks. I didn't have parmesan cheese so i added a little mozzarella to the sauce. It was quite tasty!! Will definitely make again. I didn't put the noodles in the layers as suggested by some but I made some plain bow tie to eat along with. I think I would of liked it better without the noodles. They took away from the blend of flavors and made it a little  bland. I think I will have fettucine on the side next time because the casserole by itself is delicious!

This was Fantastic!!!  My fiancee loved it and it was so nice and creamy.  I used fresh baby spinach and instead of using Italian seasoning I used Lemon Herb Seasoning.  Other than that, I followed the directions to the T.  I will definately be making this again.  Thanks!!!

Delicious! I used fresh spinach rather than canned, substitued milk for the cream and omitted the bacon. It was so good, my roommate and I were fighting over the leftovers. I think I will add a bit more spinach and mushrooms next time.

This dish was excellent.  I cook often and my husband said that this was one of my best in a while!  I cut the chicken into pieces and cooked in a sauteed onions and garlic, and also added a layer of rice after the spinach (i used frozen).  It was a hit :)

This was OK. If I were to make it again I would use fresh spinach & saute with garlic to give it some flavor. I love bacon but for this recipe, it didn't seem to fit in so I left it out. I used the fat free soup, too and the sauce was still pretty rich.  Not bad.

I like this recipe. It's got a lot of really good flavor and is easy to make. I, like the others, cooked bite-size pieces of chicken in the skillet to save time. The first time I made it I used 2 cans of spinach but think it only needed one so changed it the second time. It's a nice variation from traditional chicken dishes in my opinion. I played with the dish the two times I made it and it turned out great each time. Seems hard to mess up!

YUM! I only used 1/2 the butter and seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder and pepper before I baked it. Did not add the bacon bits or the mozzarella but did top with additional asiago cheese.
The chicken was moist,flavorful and the entire dish was well rounded.
Served this with the baked brown rice form this site.

It was very good, but I personally think I would like it better without the spinach on the bottom! My mother and husband loved it either way though :).

way too garlicy. I would reduce the garlic by half, and use low sodium soup. I served this over rice in order for it to soak up some of the garlic. I would definitely make this again.

Made this last night and it was tastier than I thought it would be.  My boyfriend and I actually liked it.  I cooked some rice on the side to eat with it.  I bought some tenders and cut those up and dropped them in some chicken broth to cook up.  Happened to have one left over breast from a roasted one bought at the grocery store and cut that up and added to the cooked tenders.  The changes I made were I did not put lemon juice in it.  And I used milk instead of half and half.  Also bought frozen spinach instead.  I would only use one box of spinach next time, as we are not avid spinach fans.  I thought the Italian Seasoning was too much and think I will halve that next time I make it.  I made my own bacon bits instead of using the jar ones.  Overall it was a very good recipe and got me to eat spinach.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very tasty and creamy - however I only used 1 pkg. of frozen spinach and it was still overwhelming (And I love spinach!). I also subsituted skim for half and half. Next time I will not use spinach and try artichoke hearts instead.

This was really good - although I did leave out the mushrooms because I don't like them.  My husband thought it was terrific too.  One thing - mine turned out VERY salty (and I'm a salt fanatic) even though I did not add salt.  So - next time I will use low sodium soup, or put individual italian spices in or something like that to cut down on the salt.

This was very tasty.  I pan fried the chicken in butter, removed and then did the sauce in the pan.  My only complaint was that there seemed to be way too much spinach.  I will definetly make this again but will use only 1 can of spinach.

This was really delicious.  Please my wife said it was very easy to make.  I think it was more like a thick soup than a casserole though.  I recommended we eat it on a bed of pasta or rice or even toast next time.  I think you could add stuff as well...I think mushrooms and peas would go great with this casserole.  It's certainly a keeper though.

I used low fat cream of mushroom soup and 2% milk instead of half and half. This recipe was tasty, but rather salty. I would make it again  because it is good, but it will be rare since it's not heart-friendly.  Makes good leftovers.

Did not have time to marinate, but turn out great anyway. I can not wait to try it again, allowing the seasoning to have time to permeate. Thanks!

I wish I would have used much less Italian seasoning than what the recipe calls for. Also the chicken ended up way overcooked! 50 minuets is way too long!Sorry!

My family loved it, and I am a horrible cook.  I did use advice of other reviewers and used alittle italian seasoning, only 1 can of spinach & did cut-up/brown the chicken breasts.  My boyfriend gave me thumbs up and said he loved the flavors.  It is very filling and a heavy/rich dinner.  Should rename to heart attack on a plate, but it is delicious!

Delicious comfort food. Definitely recommend slicing up the chicken before serving if you have time. Helps integrate the flavors.

I stuck pretty much to the recipe except that I precooked the chicken in the microwave.  No cream so I used cream cheese.  Will be making this again and again.  I served it with tricolour pasta but will try with rice next time.

This was so friggin good. I made it just as suggested, minus the lemon juice, and it was delicious! I didn't even make any rice or pasta with it, just garlic bread. Next time I will add some spices to the chicken, but no salt because the sauce is salty enough. I will make this at least once a month.

This was a big hit in our household!  I sauteed the chicken like other reviews recommended and it turned out great.  I also added lots of fresh mushrooms and roasted red peppers for a bit more taste.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband is a fisherman and loves to eat all kinds of seafood. I needed a new recipe and when I read Bryan's remark's that this recipe could be used with fish or shrimp, I started to read the reviews and it seemed that no one used it with seafood until now! I used 2 flounder fillets, 2 bags of fresh spinach and did add a little of Chef Paul's seafood spice and followed the recipe exactly using all ingredients. He loved it and I really enjoyed making it. Thanks Bryan!!

Great recipe, easy to make and delicious. I only used 1/2 the mozzarella cheese and I added a can of chopped artichoke hearts for more flavor.

Quite good.  I like bacon bits but I'd cut the amount in half next time.  This turned out quite a bit better than expected.  Didn't make 5 stars though.  I did just brown the chicken in a pan rather than oven cooking.

Pretty good.  I'm not a big spinach fan, so next time I will use half of the spinach called for.  After I baked the chicken, I cut it into large chunks before adding it to the dish.  I would definitely use fresh bacon instead of bacon bits even though it will require a little extra time.  Thanks for the recipe!

this recipe was surprisingly incredible. i haven't been cooking for very long so i wasn't expecting anything great, but it was so easy and i felt like i was eating a great chef's dinner. i think it was a tad bit salty, though - so i will probably cut the bacon bits to half next time. also, i only used one can of spinach and i thought that was plenty. unless you just love spinach. it was fantastic, and i will most definitely make it many times over.

This is great recipe!  It will be great to make for company.  I didn't use the bacon (didn't seem to need it) and I used a 10 ounce box of chopped frozen spinach that I thawed and drained, instead of the canned spinach.  I made the Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce as a side dish.  My boyfriend was quite impressed with this dinner!

This was wonderful. The only thing I did different was no bacon and one can of spinach. I took the chicken off the top then mixed up the spinach and mushrooms with the sauce put the chicken on a bed of egg noodles (next time angel hair) then poured the sauce over it all and watched my three kids eat spinach. My husband loved it also. It was proclaimed to be a "make again"! This is going in my little purple notebook, Thanks much!!

YUM!  This was really good!  I have to admit, I used 10 oz. of thawed frozen spinach (because we are not big spinach eaters) and doubled the mushrooms.  I chopped the chicken and sauteed them on the stovetop with the mushrooms instead of baking.  Subbed FF half-and-half, reduced fat parm, 98% FF soup and part-skim mozzarella to help with the calories and it still tasted incredibly rich and delicious.  Loved this, thanks for the post!!!

We eat this quite a bit.  It's very good and a nice break from the ordinary.  We tried artichokes in place of the mushrooms and it turned out great.  Also left out the Italian seasoning just out of preference.

I made this just as the recipes follows (except I used frozen spinach) and we thought it was terrific. The sauce is excellent. It's rare that I end up making restaurant quality food at home, but this dish is truly restaurant quality.

WAY too much cheese!  WAY!!  And WAY too much italian seasoning.  I felt like I was having a chicken florentine pizza.  It tasted good, but it's not a 5 by any stretch.  A 5 should be superior and extraordinary.  This is decent and even my boyfriend (who will eat ANYTHING) told me it was just okay.  That shocked me.

We loved this recipie.  I changed a few things to make it lower in fat.  I used 98% fat free cr. of mush soup and fat free half and half.  I also used 4 pieces of real bacon and only a handfull of mozerella cheese.  This was an awesome meal.  I would definately make this again!

This was a fantastic dish and it is worthy of serving to guests.  Like many of the other reviewers, I used fresh spinach instead of canned...it turned out fantastic.  Also, I made extra sauce and served this over pasta to make it a little lighter.  This is a heavy and filling recipe but, the taste is superb!  If you serve it on pasta, add a salad and some garlic bread, you have the perfect meal.  My husband and our friends loved it!  Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!

I used fresh spinach instead of canned and used real bacon instead of the bits. I served this with lightly buttered egg noodles sprinkled with garlic powder.  Everyone loved it.

First of all the sauce was amazing.  I cut up the chicken, and used frozen spinach.  I think I used too much because it was a little overwhelming.  I mixed everything together and layered it in a casserole over cooked white rice.  My son didn't care for it, but my husband and I liked it and I sent some home with my ex-husband and he and his wife liked it a lot as well.  I'll definitely make it again with less spinach this time.  (My fault, not the recipe...but I don't like canned veggies.)

i don't know...for all of the hype, it just was not that great. i used fresh ingredients for everything (no canned bacon bits, fresh baby spinich instead of canned, etc)and it took about 2 hours to put it all together and cook, not the 25 minutes specified in the recipe.  i think it is way overated. you would think you cannot go wrong with the cheese, soup and bacon...but oh well. would not make again.

Mine did not come out well. I agree with the other person, WAY too much Italian seasoning. Mine was gloppy, maybe I did something wrong.

I liked this, but the canned spinach was not my cup of tea.  If I make this again, I will use fresh spinach.  My family liked it.  I cut up the chicken and mixed everything together except for the spinach.  I also cooked four thighs and left them whole.

The sauce was delicious. I used Portobello mushrooms, but I think regular mushrooms or button mushrooms might be better.  I'm not a fan of spinach, so I might leave that out next time. I also left off the bacon bits because I didn't have any.

Fool proof perfection! I made this last minute and in the rush I was in, used a tablespoon instead of teaspoon for the lemon juice and garlic before I realized the error of my ways. It still turned out delicious. No left-overs!

This recipe is delicious. The directions were easy to follow and it was simple to prepare. It definitely tastes like an italian restaurant entree and it is VERY rich! We loved it and it will be part of our regular menu rotation around here! Even my picky kids ate it and loved it! Thanks for sharing.

Im writing this for my husband. I havent gotten to try this yet. I made it the night before because I knew Id be home too late the next day to make dinner. All he had to do was top it with the cheese and pop it in the oven. HE LOVED IT. He loves his spinach anyway but he raved about this dish and when he is that happy about his dinner, Im on cloud nine. I cant wait to try it myself! Thanks!

It was incredible!

This recipe was great.  My dad absolutely ate it (he's a tough person to try new recipes!).  I did follow the other comments for using milk instead of half and half.  To cut the amount of fat, I also bought the fat free version of the cream of mushroom soup.  I also added in  some shredded carrots and fresh mushrooms and garlic.  I would say to double the sauce if you like it really saucy but for our family, it was fine.  We ate it over angel hair noodles.  Any type of pasta or rice will work fine for this recipe! Mahalo (Thanks) for this recipe!

This is a "keeper"!!  My husband has never liked it when I sneak in spinach, but he loves this dish.  Served over white rice.  I've made it twice, and have not had the bacon bits.  I've used fresh spinach, and wilted it into the sauce.  Great recipe!

How disappointing this casserole was!  I read so many rave reviews so I thought I picked the greatest recipe ever to make for my friend's family who just had a baby.  Way, way, too much Italian seasoning.  I used actual Italian seasoning which I bought especially for this recipe. It ruined the taste and was too overpowering.  Really bums me out!

This was an excellent dish.  I was skeptical of it at first but it was delicious.  The only changes made was to use only about half the cheese and used a bag of fresh baby spinach instead.

This recipe was great! The only thing that I would do is put less spinach (it dominated the taste of the casserole).

Delicious, the chicken is perfectly tender.  Next time I will use fresh seasoned spinach, and maybe use skim milk to cut down on the calories. However, this is delicious, and I'm making it again!

EXCELLENT. I did add more mushrooms (8oz), I used the 98% ff mushroom soup, I used part half and half and part skim milk, and I used turkey bacon. It was soooo yummy. This is a keeper. Thank you!

This recipe was delicious. I will definetly make this again.  I did take the advice of a few and used milk instead of the half-n-half and left out the bacon just to lower some of the fat.  Thanx to the creator of this recipe.

I made this dish last night for my first dinner party ever and everyone asked me for the recipe! I never thought I see the day when people would fight over taking leftovers that I made.  This is a great easy recipe and it's sure to please.

Brought this to a potluck and everyone loved it.  Many went up for seconds.  Did not add the bacon bits like many others suggested and added a little extra garlic for taste.  Be careful with the Italian seasoning you use.  Mine was extremely heavy on the oregano which definitely detracted from the taste for myself and my family.  Will find a better seasoning next time.

Wonderful!!  I made this last night for just my boyfriend and me and it was perfect.  I used fresh spinach instead of canned and didn't have any half and half, so I used whole milk instead and it came out great.  I also left out the bacon bits as a personal prefrence and it wasn't missed - the sauce has great flavor already.  I served it with warm chiabatta bread, but I think I'll try it with pasta next time because the sauce is so good. I definitely reccommend this for an easy week night dinner that tastes like something you'd get eating out.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous.  I used healthy request cream of mushroom soup and skim milk instead of cream to lighten it up a tad.  I think I'll double the sauce next time.   Great leftover!!

This was a hit! A couple of things though, i diced the chicken and didn't have time to bake as suggested, so I quickly pan fried them until golden.  I also used frozen spinach well squeezed of all juice.  I didn't bother with the bacon chips, and personally didn't mind or notice. It was great without them. Pan frying makes the whole meal finished and on the table to be served in about 30 minutes - too easy!! To make this a complete meal, start with rice on the base of your casserole dish (cooked that is) and follow the recipe from there.  It is a chicken floretine rice slice.  My husband loves this dish, did I mention that my husband loves this dish???

This recipe is in the top 5 best dishes I have ever made/tasted.  It is so good, that I would serve it to guests.  My husband loved it as did my 2 1/2 year old.  The only thing I did differently was use frozen spinach as opposed to canned.  Excellent with squash and a salad with Italian dressing!

Excellent and great taste.  I used broccolli instead of spinach and I would use only 1 cup of mozzarella next time.

When I made it it ended up tasting alot like bacon. I don't know if that's the goal. When I make it again I think that I won't make it with spinach. My family didn't even eat the bottom layer.

I've made this twice now and it was great both times!  I like to serve it with egg noodles or garlic butter spaghetti.  My only alteration is using 2 packages of frozen spinach in place of canned.

Really good.  I made some alterations to cut some fat.  I used lowfat milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 and omitted the mozzarella altogether.  The recipe was still very flavorful and rich with these changes.  I think you could probably cut the butter in half as well.  I also used fresh spinach instead of canned.  Yummy.

Excellent recipe.  I used fresh spinach to help reduce the salt and also used Cream of Chicken Soup rather than mushroom.  Definately a hit with my family.  My 4 year old said, "Mommy this is the bestest chicken ever!".  The dish looks wonderful presentation wise as well.  I served over noodles.

Great recipe.  I made it without the bacon, didn't have any on hand, and it was still great.  (How could it taste bad with all that butter and cream).  This is a recipe to make when you are having friends over...it has tons of flavor!

Very good, but like others tweaked it a bit-- used froz spinach as well (canned sounded too slimy), also used only 1 c mozzarella, seasoned chix breasts while baking and served over noodles.  Next would try making it lighter by using milk, less butter etc and may season spinach mixture a bit.  Very tasty though, will make again-- great for taking to a friend whose had a baby etc.  thanks!!

This was good but it didn't knock my socks off. At least I can say I have tried it now. Doubt I would make again. I pounded my chicken breasts thinner and probably shouldn't have made them as thin as I did. Used frozen spinach and cooked it in the microwave and then added. We didn't think it was too salty, perhaps because we didn't use the canned spinach. Also used real bacon bits.

wow this was GREAT! i made a few changes to lessen the fat content. reduced the butter to 2T, used 2% milk instead of half and half, used a 1/8c of parmesean, didn't use any bacon, and only used 1c of the mozzerella. also i used chicken tenderloins and seasoned them with garlic powder and pepper when baking them the first time. This was a GREAT recipe!

This dish was a life saver!  Had to prepare for a Holiday potluck at work and I was able to get this dish together in no time at all.  Made a few changes--Spiced the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and salt.  Used monteray jack and cheddar cheese because I like a little more zest.  For a change, I have also substituted spinach for broccoli and nixed the mushrooms.  Love this dish!

I made this and was an incredible hit!! I used fresh Spinach instead and added one crushed garlic clove to the sauce. I will be making this over and over again.

I, too, adapted the amounts to be not quite so deadly, but my husband still kept saying, This is too good to be good for you.

Decadent, Rich, Overflowing with flavor.  This dish is awesome.  Before you make it though, get the number from a good cardiologist.  OR have some defibrilators standing by.

Very easy to make and very tasty.
I froze some portions and it microwaves very well for a quick lunch. Will definately make this one again. Thanks Bryan
