Something different and delicious! I wanted to try this but had to go with what I had on hand, using bottled lime juice (so no zest). Also, I cooked the popcorn in coconut oil which works well with all of the flavors. Yum and healthy! I loved the kick from the siracha; never would have thought to use it but it works great! This will be better with fresh lime and zest the next time! Thanks ellie, great recipe! UPDATE: I made this again with REAL lime juice and zest, and it was a whole lot better (no surprise). The lime zest is noticeable, and so good, I'd even add a bit more! FYI: Best eaten when you make it. Mine was very soggy and not good on the next day.

This was AWESOME!!!!!! I popped the popcorn in my air popper, but that was my only change. Great combo of flavors...salty, tangy and buttery with a nice kick, but not too spicy at all. My little guy said this was 5 stars after one bite, lol! This was a HUGE hit for our weekly 'dip night'...I will def be making this again and again~YUM! Thanks, ellie, for sharing this wonderful recipe. :)

A nice change to plain popcorn.  I cooked the popcorn using the 'Gourmet Microwave Popcorn' method from AR.  Love the bite that the sriracha provided, but really enjoyed the taste of the lime and the lime zest.  Thanks ellie, for the great twist to plain popcorn.

Great for popcorn lovers and Sriracha lovers.  I'm both.  If the corn is too soggy, dump onto a baking sheet lined with foil and spread evenly, then put in an oven at 350 deg. for about 10 min.  This lets the corn dry and crisp up.

Sorry but this was just ok. The family ate it. I think the problem was that the lime juice made it soggy - very soggy.

We liked it. Very good flavor! What I didn't like was when I poured the melted butter, lime juice and Sriracha on, the popcorn melted down. And all  the bottom  pieces were super soggy.

I made this recipe for my mom and she LOVED it. Even though it sat for a while before she ate it, it was still spicy and flavorful!

Flavors are great but if you let it sit it does get soggy, so probably best not to make too far in advance.  Used my air popper to pop the corn.

This is good, and a new twist on a treat that I love. I also added cilantro, because, why not?
A few people have complained that the sauce makes the popcorn soggy. I didn't have this problem.
 If you dribble the sauce slowly over the popcorn and then mix it all together really well (shake it in a ziplock bag maybe) it gets just a hint of taste on all the pieces. I found it to be a perfect amount of flavor to be deliciously addictive!
