I used 4 bananas for this recipe and made muffins, baking for 20-25 minutes. I added walnuts, chocolate chips and raisins separately to some of the muffins and left a few plain (I liked the ones with raisins best). I didn't have wheat germ but added some applesauce (between 1/4-1/2 cup) to help alleviate the dryness. A very tasty recipe.

This is a great recipe. Very flavorful and moist. I can hardly tell that there's whole wheat flour in there! Tastes great for breakfast with some peanut butter on top. I've made 6 mini loaves already- I always have a bunch of overripe bananas.

Hard to believe there's no sugar in this recipe. The only change I would make is to add more bananas. Otherwise, it really went over well in our household.  I'll definitely make this one again.

My husband really likes this bread.  It is quite easy to make since there is no rise time or yeast in the recipe.  I do not consider this a dessert bread since it is not very sweet.  I found it a tad dry.  I also took my bread out of the oven at 55 minutes and it was a little overdone on the edges.  Definitely check your bread loaf for doneness frequently after 45 minutes.  I added sunflower seeds and chopped walnuts and that was very good.

Very tasty - buy extra bananas when they are on special so you can make this bread.  I've made this three times and adding extra bananas helps with the dryness, but then, so does spreading the warm bread with a little peanut butter! :) Bottom line: an easy, healthy recipe that's ideal for a mom-to-be like me.  I may try freezing  my next loaf so I have some ready when I get home from the hospital!

Excellent recipe. A good, dense, moist texture. I used four small bananas and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  It was a hit with my family.

I thought the bread could have been a little sweeter but overall it was good.  I think I'll add raisins when I make it again and that will add the sweetness I think it needs.  Just made it today though and it may be more flavorful tomorrow.

Absolutely love this bread!!! To alleviate any dryness, soak any nuts in a cup of warm water while preparing the rest of the recipe. This will allow them to soak up any fluid that they might later draw out of the bread causing dryness. Also, I added 1/2 cup of instant 5 grain oat cereal, a handfull of flax seeds, a small freshly pureed apple, and a tsp of allspice. Very moist and chewy. The family loves it!!!

Pretty darn good & healthy.  I didn't have enough bananas so I used 1/2 cup applesauce and it was still good.  Thanks for a good & healthy recipe.

I made muffins instead of bread, and they turned out great! I loved them plain and in milk. I think I will try more bananas next time, to soften them.

Great! I have started eating healthier and am always looking for recipes with whole wheat/grains instead of white flour.  These are perfect.  Only adjustments I made was to increase bananas to 2 cups, I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil, and added cinammon.  Also, I used brown sugar instead of honey since I wanted my 10 month old to have some (under 1 should not have honey).  Also, I made these into muffins (took 15 minutes to bake in a convection oven).  I omitted pecans in half of them (again, no nuts for the baby) and put pecans in the rest and sprinkled some nuts on top of them also.  They baked perfect.  I like moist muffins, so that is why I increased the bananas, and figured it would be good to use the applesauce instead of the oil.  If you like the bread/muffins a little more cakey- I would not increase the bananas.  Can't wait to make later with the honey, sounds delicious!!!

This bread came out really good.  The whole wheat flour, wheat germ and honey
really complement the banana flavor.  I did however reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.

Simply delicious!
I use apple sauce (1/3 cp) instead of oil, also use walnuts, and ground flax seed (substitute flax for a little bit of the flour-about 1/8cp) sometimes I add raisins, sometimes chocolate chips. I always put more mashed bananas than the recipe calls for.

I prefer to bake these as muffins, last weekend I baked them as mini muffins (about 28 units) with chocolate chips and they were a big hit - everone that tasted them asked me for the recipe - including a man who never cooks (his wife is still skeptical about this...)

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. Thanks!

Very good and healthy alternative to the "norm". My only negative... it's a little heavy.

Very good banana bread.  One critique...my baking time was about 45-50 minutes.  An hour would have been too long.

Oh this is so good! I subbed applesauce for the oil and used 4 mashed bananas. I tried it with cream cheese, butter, honey, and peanut butter (each separately!)... by FAR the best was with peanut butter. This is probably the best breakfast in the world! Thanks!

Not only is this recipe easy, but it is yummy AND good for you!  Even my kids (5 & 15 months) love it! I made just a few minor changes - reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon, used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and I added 1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon.  Also, I made 4 mini loaves and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.

This recipe is EXCELLENT! Very moist and tastes great...I've made muffins and added raisins once and chopped up figs once, both were great additions.   I also substituted flax seeds for wheat germ.

Very good, dense and moist. As everyone else, I made it to my liking,  and will list my changes below. But that doesn't take away from this wonderful, healthier choice for my kids favorite bread. Ok I added, 1\2 tsp baking powered, 1\2 cup applesauce, 1\2 tsp cinnamon, a pinch nutmeg, reduced the honey to a 1\4 cup, added 1\4 cup brown sugar,  1\4 cup mini chocolate chips, I did NOT add wheat germ. And yes the chocolate chips are not healthy. but still it's better then the white flour and cup of sugar my old recipe had. Now I put it all in the bread machine on dough setting, just to let it mix. With my cheap bread machine I had to help it mix some. Then set it to bake, took an 1 hour 10 minutes in the bread machine. Even the ends were moist. Kids loved it.

I would give it five stars purely for the nutrional improvement on traditionally banana bread. The only negative I have for this recipe is it is a little dry. My husband thought is was good after he poured honey all over it(he said'"it could use more sugar"). My preschoolers ate it with no complaints or compliments. I did add an extra banana, because I had one. Next time I might try to help with the dryness and nutritional value by replacing the oil with 1/2 cup of applesauce.

Very delicious bread! I substituted applesauce in place of the oil. I used two bananas but next time plan to use three.  I also added walnuts for a nice crunch.

This recipe is not for everyone, but it works for me. It is like the marriage of wheat bread, banana bread, and a bran muffin. It has very little sweetness, but it tastes well with a little whipped butter. It bakes up so nicely too. I used the exact sized pan suggested. It happens to be a darker baking pan of mine, but I used Bakers Joy spray and seemed to have no issues with over browning. I sprinkled the top with chopped pecans before baking and suggest that as a garnish. As far as ingredients I followed the recipe exactly except I used wheat bran instead of wheat germ and safflower oil for the vegetable oil. I also noted that the 1 1/2 cups of bananas came to 3 1/2.

Delicious!!!!  Not overly sweet, like so many banana bread recipes.  I cooked my loaf for 55 minutes, and it came out a little dark....I will try 45 minutes next time.  I used 3 bananas, and that was barely 1-1/2 cups.  Next time, I will try substituting applesauce, like so many have done, and ground flax seed. I may top the loaf with sunflower or pumpkin seeds, as well.   Just the smell in my kitchen of this bread baking made it worthwhile!

I try out banana bread recipes all the time and this one is thee best ever! I'm a health nut so I tweaked it like everyone else does on this site to suit my needs. Finally a recipe that uses just whole wheat bread. Love it, love it. Whoop!

I really like this recipe.  I knew from the ingredients that it would be savoury rather than sweet. It is definitely NOT your grandma's traditional recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  It was moist and took an hour to bake. It was just what I was looking for as it keeps my sweet tooth happy without adding so many calories to my day

For me this bread was a bit dry and bland (and I was careful not to over-handle the dough). I used 4 big bananas and added 1 tsp cinnamon and some nutmeg. Next time I might add some brown sugar or chocolate chips, and use more bananas (the good bites are the ones that have little sweet chunks of banana); applesauce might also help. It also might need to be covered at least half of the time it's in the oven - the top of mine started to burn at 35 minutes (I live at high altitude. Ugh). I'll definitely try it again with these modifications.

We just took these out of the oven and they are wonderful! I did make a few changes: 1. Added about a 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds 2. Used Agava syrup instead of honey(just didn't have honey on hand) 3. Added 1/2 of applesauce. We baked them as muffins for 15 minutes. Will make again.

shamefully I admit, between 4 people we went through an entire loaf in less than a day!!  I didn't change the oil to applesauce because I was afraid it would be dry (I'll try it next time and will soak the walnuts like another person mentioned).  I added cinnamon like most people said and used walnuts instead of pecans.  I also used sugar free honey as I no longer eat sugar.  great recipe & healthy!!

update - I've made this both ways (per recipe and changing oil to apple sauce) and it taste exactly the same both ways, so delicious!

This is fantastic banana bread. I used applesauce instead of oil and added a few chocolate chips for additional sweetness. GREAT! I am always being asked for the recipe.

I just made this recipe for my 17 month old  (for easy breakfasts) and it turned out great. I halved the recipe. I took the advice of some of the other reviews and used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. I used 2 mashed bananas and I added 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt. Came out really moist and not too sweet. I made them as mini muffins (it made 1 full tray of 24 mini muffins) and separated them into sandwich bags with 2 or 3 in each bag and froze them. Oh, I also should say that I only baked them for about 20 minutes. Great recipe.

Excellent bread!! Great, nutritious breakfast or snack. One caution, though - while the recipe is pretty forgiving, don't mess with it too much. I did, and it didn't turn out well at all. So treat it nicely, and it will turn out really well!

Hooray! A 100% whole wheat bread that tastes delicious! I've always made whole wheat, honey-sweetend muffins for my children since they could eat them, but these are ones mom and dad love too! I love that they have wheat germ and no refined sugar. With this recipe I like to make about 10 mini-muffins for my son, and then I use the rest of dough to make regular muffins for my husband and me. After I fill the mini-muffins I usually stir in some chocolate chips for the adults they're so healthy we cheat a little). I don't use nuts as my husband doesn't prefer them. These taste as good to me as white bread muffins. Once you get yourself adjusted to whole wheat you won't notice the difference (sort of like skim milk!). I have rarely given our children white bread and they love wheat - it really is about what they are exposed to. In fact I have a great whole wheat pancake recipe that my son loves. We took him to Cracker Barrel for breakfast once and he wouldn't eat his pancakes because they weren't like mommy's! All that said, if you want a delicious, healthy bread/muffin recipe and want to expose your family to whole wheat this is a great place to start!

I tried this bread recipe yesterday night. I halved the recipe as it was a trial version. I did not have wheat germ, so I pulsed Quaker quick cooking oats in the grinder and used that (same measure). I don't like pecans and also didn't have any, so used chopped cashews. Baked it for 30 mins at 180 C and the bread turned out perfect. Not too sweet, not moist or dry, just like fresh bread. My family finished half of it after dinner. In the morning everyone tried a slice with a little butter and also lightly toasted (without butter). We all loved it and now I have a reliable bread recipe to use every week. Thank you Gladys George. Wish you all the best.

This was a fantastic recipe. I did make some modifications as others have suggested such as increasing the bananas (I added five) and substituting 1/2 cup of applesauce for the oil. I omitted the wheat germ, because i didn't have any on hand and nuts because my son doesn't like the texture of them. Neither were missed. Absolutely fantastic. I didn't have a loaf pan or muffin pans so I baked it in a large cast iron skillet for 50 minutes. Came out perfect and yummy. Thanks for a healthy option for this bread. Yummy. (And my furrbabies can even have some for treats with the ingredients which means I don't have to make their treats separate from my yummy goodness.)

We made this and it tasted great! We used agave nectar instead of honey, and we added extra bananas and about 1/3 cup of applesauce.  We did not add nuts.  We took ours out at 45 minutes, and it was a little bit undercooked at the top.  Next time we will use a wooden toothpick to check doneness (our plastic one did not work!)

I put oatmeal instead of wheat germ, added a handful of flaxseed, omitted pecans and use 1 egg cause that's what I have in hand and it came out moist and soft.  My husband likes it and I absolutely love it.

This is my 1st recipe w/ entirely wheat flour and wheat germ. I was nervous that is was going to turn out dry. I took the tips & tricks of others and it came out moist & delicious.
I replaced the oil with natural applesauce, soaked the walnuts in water while preparing the bread, used 4 bananas, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp, and added dark chocolate chips.
I made mini loaves and cooked them for 25-28 minutes.
My picky husband said it was awesome!
Will definitely be making this again.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  I've made this bread 3 times.  If you're looking for a great-tasting, nutrition-dense banana bread that isn't high and fat and sugar, this is it.    I use 4 bananas.  I had trouble getting the bread out of my corning ware 9x5x3 loaf pan, so switched to using 2-8x4x2.5 metal pans.  I set the timer for 50 minutes, and the bread was perfect.

This was AMAZING - so yummy, but also healthy as well!!! I used 2C of bananas, but other than that, followed the recipe.  It got us a 9X4 loaf, as well as 12 muffins.  DELICIOUS!

I would cook it for less time.....It got too dark and burnt around the edges.  I might add some spices like cinamon.  Other than that it was really good.  The only banana bread I will contiue to make.  My family loved it and its healthy for a snack or quick breakfast.

I made this right to the recipe, baked it in the toaster oven for 55 minutes, and it turned out great.  Not as sweet or oily as traditional banana bread, which makes it a great afternoon snack for me and my kids.

This bread turned out fantastically!  I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for the oil and threw in 1/4 cup dried figs.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I was a little worried about grittiness from the fig seeds, but the heartiness of the wheat made them barely noticable :)  I may use another banana next time, just for some extra banananess (i used four).  I'm taking a loaf to work tomorrow for my co workers, i just know they'll love it!

this recipe is fantastic and, with a few minor adjustments it makes a perfect treat for babies as well! I substituted molasses for the honey,applesauce for the oil and, 4 egg whites for the eggs(although if your baby is o.k to have egg whites you can leave it as is)Also to make it a little more spicy I added 1/4tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice and, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. My 10 month old son loves it!!(oh make sure your baby is o.k to have whole wheat before making this =>)

This is an excellent and healthy bread!! It's not overly sweet, has a great texture, and is perfect for breakfast or a snack. The only problem is that the nuts are missing from the list of ingredients, but the usual 1/2 cup of chopped pecans or walnuts works out fine.

Tried this yesterday. It was a hit!! I was skeptical because of the wheat germ, and am not used to cooking with honey. I've had a 'passion' for banana nut bread forever. I love this!! This is a great recipe! Thanx!~~ joy.h

I LOVE this banana bread recipe. I've made this several times. I have a batch in the oven right now! I make muffins and cook only 20-25 minutes. The only thing I do different is add mini chocolate chips. Great for breakfast or as a snack!

This is fantastic!  The texture was perfect (I made mini loaves and baked for 28 minutes), and this tastes good as well as tasting healthy.  I do agree with some of the other comments about using more bananas though.  1 1/2 cups does not seem to provide enough banana taste to this bread.

I made this recipe and it was dry, real dry.  I did not have any honey so I used agave syrup but I can't imagine that would change it's texture.  I will not make this one again unless I double the oil.

I used 4 bananas and added raisins and chocolate chips. Made muffins out of them and they are delicious. Not too sweet, which is what I like about them. Thanks!

I substituted vanilla yogurt for the vegetable oil, used ground flax instead of wheat germ (what I had on hand), used 1/4 c. honey and 1/4 brown sugar, and added 1 c. dark chocolate chips.  It turned out great and the chips added a different taste to the bread that was nice!

Sorry, this did not appeal to anyone in the family. No one liked the combination of honey and banana, and it was not sweet enough.  The texture was decent, that's about the only good thing I can say about it.  I have tried many banana bread recipes, and this one is probably the worst.

So glad I found this recipe! I did what many reviewers recommended and upped the bananas to 2 cups (~ 4 small to medium bananas) and used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans and added 1/2 cup of craisins. I substituted egg beaters whites for the eggs.  It turned out great, very hearty and filling and plenty moist.  It makes a great "breakfast bread"!

Excellent. I have tried about 10 different banana bread recipes and this one is the best.  It combines ease of making with being tasty and healthy.

Because of health reasons, my husband and I are trying to eliminate refined and processed foods.   This bread is delicious!  I substituted maple syrup for honey.  Instead of using veg. oil, I used 1/8 c olive oil and 1/2 c apple sauce.  Reduced cooking time to 50 minutes.

This wasn't as sweet or as moist as other banana breads I've tried but it was still good.  I topped each slice with honey and that made it great.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg per some other reviewer's suggestions.

Update: 
I made this again using vanilla yogurt in place of the oil, 4 very ripe bananas and cinnamon honey.  This time it came out very moist and much more flavorful. - it didn't need the honey topping.  I also watched the cooking time very closely and stopped it at 45 minutes so that it wouldn't dry out.

Almost perfect!  Only needs some flavorings like cinnamon and nutmeg.  Texture was good and firm but not too dry.  I would prefer it a bit more moist, but it was okay as is.  We topped it with an oat streusel and it was great.

This is my absolute new favorite banana bread recipe!  I grew up eating banana bread and this is the best ever! I used apple sauce instead of the oil, added extra vanilla and a teas of butter extract, and left out one of the egg yokes.  I also laid a few pecans on the top of the loaf for more pecan flavoring.  Lastly I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and it turned out great!  Slices beautifully and great for toasting and having plain or with coffee.  :-)

I might sweeten it up a little for next time, but it was really moist and almost cake like texture.  I sprinkled some oats and brown sugar on top.  Loaf looked great, wish I had taken a picture!!

A good, healthy banana bread.  I love that there is not refined sugar or flour in this recipe!  My one complaint is that it's a bit dry...and I even tried adding an extra 1/2C mashed bananas.  Definitely try not to overbake this!  Also, chocolate chips are a yummy substitution for the nuts.

Tasty for a whole wheat bread- not too dry like many like it. It is also easy to make. I think I will try adding some different nuts/seeds and fruit next time. Also- I like to substitue 1/2 the honey for 100% maple syrup.

The recipe is great. I add a cup of applesauce to make it more moist and for variation I'll sometimes add 1/2 cup dried cranberries & 1/2 cup of almonds.

This is the best banana bread I've ever made!!  I substituted 1/4 cup splenda baking mix for the honey and added 1/4 cup each of milk and sour cream.  I replaced some of the butter with applesauce for extra moistness.  Soooo good!!!

I don't eat banana bread -- I can't stand bananas -- but I made this for my husband, and he said it was really good.  He said it was moist and perfectly sweet enough.  I did add a 1/4 cup homemade, unsweetened applesauce to the wet ingredients, and I only baked it 45 minutes.  I will almost certainly use this recipe again (even if I won't be the one eating it).

Always happy to find good tasting food that is actually healthy.  Only had an 1/8 cup of honey on hand, so also added an 1/8 cup of maple syrup  ( maybe a tiny bit more) and followed the rest of the recipe as is.  EXCELLENT!!  Thanks for Sharing!!!  The best Banana bread ever. Delicious and Healthy.  
What a combination!!Am throwing away all other banana bread recipes.  This with the whole wheat is my new keeper!!!

This recipe worked really well although I modified a few things. Used 4 mashed bananas, and replaced the oil with Smart Balance butter. To help moisten the batter, I added Vanilla Soy Milk to the mix and then poured it into a paper lined cupcake pan. This made 20 muffins. Oh yes- they baked only for 25 minutes and came out perfect! My husband and son loved it!

I thought this recipe was fantastic, although I did change a few things.  I used 4 extra ripe bananas pureed in the blender, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the vegetable oil, and I added 2 tbsp. milk because the batter was a little dry.  I poured the batter into mini muffin tins and sprinkled walnuts on top since I didn't have any pecans.  The recipe was enough to make about 55 mini muffins and I only had to cook each batch for about 12 minutes. They turned out perfect and tasted delicious.  I love them because they are such a healty treat that are great for breakfast or even a snack.  My family loved them so much that I had to hide some in the freezer for later before they were all gobbled up.  I will definately make them again!

Fantastic recipe! I'm not a great fan of honey, so I used 1/4 c honey and 1/4c raw (turbinado) sugar. I also added golden raisins ans walnuts rather than pecans. You would never guess this recipe had no white flour. It is superb!

I used this recipe to make muffins yesterday and they are delicious.  I used 5 over-ripe bananas and 1/2 cup of homemade applesauce (a recipe I found on this site) in place of the oil.  It made 12 mini muffins for my 2.5 year old daughter, and 18 regular muffins for my husband and me.  I love it.  The muffins are very very moist, and have a thick texture.  I had trouble finding wheat germ at the store, but finally found it next to the oatmeal and cream of wheat.  The muffins cooked about 15 min for the minis and 20 for the regular.  I think they taste great, my daughter loves them, and my non-muffin-eating husband even said they are "pretty good."  I can't believe these are so healthy and so delicious!

This recipe has a good flavor but it was pretty dry. I used almonds instead of pecans and cooked it about 50 mins. I have never cooked anything with wheat flour so I don't know if maybe that was the reason it was so dry.

I loved these so much that I felt compelled to write my first review!
I took the suggestions of some of the other reviews below (used 1/4 cup applesauce and added just 2 TBSP of vegetable oil).  I also added an extra banana and did not mash them completely so that there would be big banana chunks in the muffins.  Topped each with a whole pecan before baking and they turned out beautifully.  Will definitely be making these again!

Very good and healthy.     Used 1/4 rolled oats instead of wheat germ.  Instead of 1/4 cup of oil, I used 2 TBS veggie oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  Did not have honey, substituted brown sugar.  I made muffins instead of bread.  I did not mix in the nuts, I sprinkled them on top of the muffins.  Cooked the muffins for 30 mintues, next time I will only do 20 minutes... they were a bit dry.

I made a double batch of this today.  Milling my own Wheat Montana Prairie Gold wheat berries and subbing oat flour for the wheat germ.  I used no oil but all applesauce.  Used walnuts.  Next time I will use a little oil and more honey and maybe some dates as I didn't think it was quite sweet enough for banana bread.  We are enjoying this bread! Our 16 month old granddaugher said 'ummmmmmmmmmmm!'

Is this recipe feasible?  It doesn't mention water.  I think most bread machines will choke on the ingredients below.  I sounds great, could you please review the water content?

It's always nice to find a recipe that's healthy.  But this didn't have the right flavor...  I didn't have wheat germ so I increased the flour.  I didn't have 1 1/2 cups worth of bananas, so I topped it off with applesauce.  I still used oil, but cut it back to 1/8 cup, and substituted applesauce for the rest of it.  I added chopped almonds, nutmeg and cinnamon, and used Splenda in place of the honey.  Unfortunately for me it turned out pretty dry.  I'm planning on using more applesauce or banana next time to see if that makes it more moist.  Perhaps also cutting back on the whole wheat flour and using a bit of white flour.  Maybe a 2/3 whole wheat to 1/3 white...

I was skeptical that this recipe would actually work without the usual amount of liquid, however, it was wonderful!  We've recently started trying to eat healthier and not only did this recipe fit the criteria, it hit the spot!  We put a little bit of butter on the slices fresh out of the oven and the loaf was gone in one sitting!  Tastes almost exactly like banana bread made with white flour.  We're making more tomorrow for breakfast!!!

This was yummy.  I had no bananas so substituted homemade chunky applesauce for the bananas (equal to appr 2 cups) and the oil.  They came out dense and flavorful as muffins and would be great for the kids lunches or camping.  Thank you.

Our banana bread turned out a bit dry.  We did substitute flax seed mix for eggs to make it vegan, but i don't think that is why.  I would probably try more bananas next time?

Loved it!!!Substituted applesauce for oil and rolled oat for wheat germ. Have baked twice already, adding raisins instead of pecans. A little too heavy and healthly for my toddlers but great addition for grown-ups diet. Ended up making 6 cupcakes and 1 8x4 bread for each batch. Great recipe. Thanks Gladys!!

This is an excellent, healthy recipe that I've made many times. I do substitute 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil. We prefer this recipe as muffins or mini loaves.

This was great.  I substituted the nuts for chocolate chips and the wheat germ with rolled oats. I used 31/2 bananas and made muffins.  I was surprised to find out how delicious they were with wheat flour.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

O My God!  This bread is fabulous!  I took the advice of many of you and substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for the oil.  I also used 3 bananas, which came to approx. 2 cups mashed.  I then added a couple of tablespoons of nonfat sour cream (I know...it sounds like an oxymoron) and 1 cup of fresh blueberries and arrived at banana bread heaven.  Thanks so much!

I also used applesauce instead of the oil- turned out great, moist.  I  threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips- very good, adds a little bit of fat, but makes into a little bit more of a treat!

This is a GREAT recipe! I used pearsauce(i was out of applesauce) inplace of the oil, and egg whites in place of the eggs, and walnuts in place of the pecans, which makes it even better for you and it is great!

I made mini muffins, ready in only about 10-12 minutes in Breville Smart Oven Air!  Tossed in mini chocolate chips and crushed hazelnuts.  I LOVE that I don't have to add any sugar! Next time I will use applesauce and up the mini chocolate chips, chocolate is good for you too!!

8.22.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/6686/banana-wheat-bread/ ... I added a half cup unsweetened applesauce to help with the dryness factor mentioned in reviews; no nuts though.  I liked that you could taste the honey when first baked; day two, ya couldn't.  It's sweet enough, but not up there with most banana breads.  It doesn't taste "brown," but there is a sturdiness to it.  ;D

I made these as muffins and they cooked in 20 minutes. I was a bit skeptical, as the batter was very thick, but the texture was perfect! The only change I made was swapping the pecans for blueberries, as that's what I had on hand. I tried one almost immediately out of the oven with a smear of butter - yum!!!

The first time I made it I followed the recipe. It was good, but the next time I made changes such as adding extra bananas, flax seed, lecithin, and sun flower kernels. It's a healthy alternative to traditional banana bread.  If you like your bread with tons of sugar, this is not the recipe for you.

I used 5 medium bananas,  adjusted for high altitude, replaced oil with applesauce, and baked for 55 min. Will definitely make again. Very moist and held together well.

This is so amazingly good!  I followed a few others advice, I soaked the walnuts in warm water while preparing the other ingredients, I substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and I used four large bananas that came to 2 cups.  I also decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.  The bread came out moist and delicious. Not overly sweet. I don't think it will last the night. I'd like to try add ins in the future, maybe some dark chocolate nibs, dried cranberries... there are a lot of variations you could do to use whatever you have on hand. I think the key is to up the banana for moisture, the applesauce I like because it cuts the calories significantly.

This is a great tasting bread.  The only change I made was to replace the oil with homemade unsweetened applesauce and I used walnuts because that is what I had on hand.  Like other reviewers noted, other things could be added such as  chocolate chips or raisins.  Excellent!

Will definitely make this whenever I have over ripe bananas on hand. I grind my own wheat berries into flour (used 1 cup soft white wheat and 1 cup hard white for those familiar with these terms). Did not need the germ as my flour contains the complete wheat berry already ground in. Only other change was coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Used two cast iron loaf pans (8x4) and decreased baking time, however bread did not rise much and probably could have used just one pan. Had moist, delicious, healthy bread as an alternative to the more dessert-like banana breads I've made in the past.

I haven't eaten sweets for almost 5 years due to health issues, so finding this recipe was like finding a hidden treasure chest. I didn't realize that something so good could actually be pretty guiltless and gluten-free when made with oat flour. Thank you for a life-changing recipe. :)

Fantastic recipe!  Here are my changes:  only 1/3 cup honey, no wheat germ, no vanilla and used walnuts instead of pecans.  I have a convection oven, so only 45 minutes.  Thank you so much for such a healthy banana bread recipe! :)

Love this banana bread.  People have told me that this is the "best" banana bread they have tasted.  I also don't feel guilty giving it to my kids as an after-school snack.

I liked this recipe very much. I added about a cup of chocolate chips and some cinnamon as well. My loaf over baked a tad so next time I would only allow it to bake for about 45 minutes.

Really good, healthy recipe.  I made muffins as another reviews suggested because I always burn breads.  They turned out really well!  I added craisins and some apple butter.  Next time I will add cinnamon as well.  Good stuff.

Turned out great! I used 3 bananas, margarine instead of oil, and a little less than 1/2 c of honey. I might add another banana next time or perhaps some shredded carrots. I used walnuts (toasted them first) instead of pecans. Also I'm planning to add some spices in the future. This is a keeper!

I made this into a dozen muffins, and baked for about 22 minutes. Overall, I found them good, certainly not sweet like some banana breads, but a little dry. Perhaps baking them that long was too much, or perhaps more than 3 bananas would have helped, which is what I used.

This bread is fantastic! Tender, moist, delicious, and healthy. I used 4 bananas, a tsp of cinnamon, and applesauce in place of the oil. The kids loved it more than my "regular" banana bread. :) Thank you!!

I love the healthiness of this Banana Bread.  It was dry, however, eventhough I added 1/2 c. more banana.  Would try it again but add apple sauce for more moistness.

Pretty good. I think I used up all my wheat germ so I subbed oat bran for it, and cinnamon applesauce for the oil. I went out for a walk and came back later than what I thought so I'm not sure how long this baked, but it came out very moist and tasty. You can really taste the wheat flour and honey in this, and it gives it a reallly nice flavor change from regular banana bread.

I added extra banana as others suggested, I subbed all the oil for applesauce.  I also used imitation honey (sugar free).  The bread was really good, but check for doneness early as mine took about 10 minutes less time...  Overall an excellent and healthy recipe.

My husband loves healthy items and this one is A BIG HIT in our house.  I have made it now 5 times already!  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.  I have only changed one thing and that is what kind of nuts to add in, this time I did one loaf with almonds and one with walnuts.  Otherwise it's perfect as is!

I should have read more of the reviews before putting this together.  Unfortunately it was very dry and overdone after 50 minutes.  It certainly has potential with more banana, less bake time and possibly some sugar & cinnamon.  This time I just added honey to the top as a spread.  I will try to make again with the previous changes/additions.

You can't really go wrong with this recipe.  I didnt have any veg oil, so i used margarine; didnt have honey so used maple syrup; didnt have wheat germ, so i used wheat bran.  Tossed in choco chips, raisins and lots of nuts.  The bread didnt rise as much as I wanted still delish.

Very tasty.  I, also, used applesauce in stead of oil.  I baked muffins for 15 minutes in 350 convection oven. I lined the muffin pans with flax flour.  It made 18 muffins.

This is a beautiful recipie - the resulting bread has the perfect amount of sweetness. Sometimes I add an extra banana, which gives the bread a bit more moisture.

Wonderful!  I tried this recipe last night, it came out perfect.  moist and yummy!  Next time I'm going to change some of the ingredients like melboteast did to get a healthy bread.. I love that it's 100% wheat flour and the wheat germ is nice too!  I have been trying to get totally away from white flour due to it not being good for Our bodies.. This is a good recipe..

Made into muffins. Very dense and filling. Half a muffin for breakfast really does the trick. And healthy too!

I love when I find a moist, sweet, and delicious healthy recipe.  I opted for muffins.  The recipe made 12 large muffins.  They baked for about 30 minutes.  Everyone at work loved them.  I used Oat Bran because I did not have wheat germ and walnuts in place of pecans. Lastly, I topped each muffin with a banana chip. thank you.

Excellent. I made with the applesauce and no oil and I used maple syrup instead of the honey. It took 55 minutes to bake for me.

I made this a couple of times as a loaf of bread, but then decided to try it as muffins.  I'm not sure why, but I like the muffins MUCH better!  My 2 1/2 year old loves them, too.

This bread was good.  I used about 2/3 cup applesauce instead of oil and it ended up a little dry.  Also, I chopped the pecans very fine so my little one wouldn't choke on the larger pieces.  I think these would make better muffins.  When I make this recipe again I will make them into muffins and add a little butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon topping for the last couple minutes.

Very hearty and delicious!  I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for the oil to lower the fat.  I accidentally used baking powder instead of baking soda, but it turned out terrific anyway.  The pecans are a MUST -- they enhance the nuttiness of the whole wheat flour instead of it tasting bitter like whole wheat sometimes can.  I also liked that this wasn't overly sweet -- bet it'll go great with some fruit and yogurt for and energy packed breakfast.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Appreciated getting this recipe as wheat recipes are not readily available.  My
diet calls for this.  Very good!
