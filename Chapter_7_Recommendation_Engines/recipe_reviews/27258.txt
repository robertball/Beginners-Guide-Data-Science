While this recipe is simple, it's a bit misleading. I roasted the potatoes, tossing them first in oil and a little salt, at 350 degrees F for about 20 minutes. Then I followed the recipe, substituting my home made pesto. In the winter, I would you this brand. Tastes really good.

These are simple and easy to make.  They are a nice change from potatoes with olive oil and rosemary.  My husband and I enjoyed them and since it is made with ingredients I typically have on hand I will be sure to make again.  the potatoes have just a little tange from the pesto, a little fresh ground pepper and they were perfect.

Maybe people already know this, but the potatoes need to be in a single layer.  I had some done perfectly, and others almost raw.  I liked the taste, but I put them back in the oven at 400F for 20 mins to cook through.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did not use the brand name pesto, I made my own. I did spray the foil with the garlic flavored pam. I think it added alittle extra flavor.(YUMMY) We will be makeing this again.

These potatoes were great!  I followed the recipe, except I sprayed the foil with Garlic Pam.  I sealed up the foil and cooked on the grill (high heat 15 min per side). There were no leftovers!

A very good side dish.  This would go well with almost any meal.  I added a sprinkling of salt and pepper.  A nice change from the ordinary.
