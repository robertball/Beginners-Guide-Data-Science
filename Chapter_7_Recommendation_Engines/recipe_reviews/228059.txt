I didn't care for this recipe. Mainly there was way too much sauce (soup) for the amount of chicken -- it was more like soup. I think it needs vegetables (I did add some after but they would have been better had they cooked along with everything else).

I'm giving this a 5 at the urging of my kids. I would personally only have given it 4 stars. I made a side of mixed vegies since my one daughter did not want it in the gravy but my other daughter and I thought it really needed the vegies for the best flavor. I ran out of garlic powder so I substituted a bit of garlic salt to make up the difference in garlic powder and omitted adding extra salt. I thought it was a bit garlicky but maybe that was due to the substitution. I will probably make again because on a convenience/easy scale I would definitely rate it a 5. Great last minute after work dinner with ingredients you almost always have on hand. I used the ready made Pillsbury baby grands for my biscuits...also for ease.
