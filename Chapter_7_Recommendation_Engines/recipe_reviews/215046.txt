If you love spicy then this is the BBQ sauce for you! It was a little runny so I mixed a little bit of cornstarch with water and added it to the sauce. I also added 1 tsp of liquid smoke. Great recipe! Very easy to make :)

This sauce so Rocked my slow roasted pork that my 17 yo DS had 7 small burger buns filled with it!! DD thought I should open a restaurant.  I made the sauce the night before so all the ingreds could get all acquainted.  I used a small can of chopped jalapenos instead of the jelly, along with whole grain mustard. And boy did this turn out Scrumptious! ! Thank you, Kristen

We used this to sauce grilled chicken breast during the last few minutes of cooking and that was pretty good. Also used to make bbq beef sandwiches and I couldn't get enough sauce on the sandwich to taste it without the heat getting over the top. Soooo, I guess depending on how I use it I would need to alter the amount of ground chipotle. The flavor was good until the heat built up and masked it. I don't think I would make this again for beef or sandwiches as written. Made for recipe group 9/3/12

Made this for the recipe group pick 9/7/12....loved this rockin' sauce!  I prepared a couple days in advance as written and chilled to let all of those flavors meld, just delicious.  Served on marinated grilled chicken.  Some very good "Q" with a little fire and smoke.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

I needed an addition to making adobo sauce using my home smoked chipotles, and this is it.  The 'only' change, other than using chipotles, rather than jalapenos and dried powder, was adding 1/4 cup corn whiskey.
Awesome and have saved this recipe to do it again
Thank you !!
