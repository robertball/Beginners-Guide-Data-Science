I made this exactly as directed, even using high quality Ghirardelli white chocolate. My mango wasn't the juiciest mango, but it was ripe, the flesh was a nice bright yellow-orange colored and it was tasty. When I added the chocolate/cream mixture to the pureed mango, the texture got kind of strange and curdled looking, but I continued on with folding in the whipped cream and beating in the softened gelatin. I poured this into the 9" spring form pan like the recipe stated, and the mixture barely covered the bottom of the pan! I then proceeded to scrape it out of the spring form pan and put it into two martini glasses. All I can think of is that something got lost in translation with this recipe. The pan size is definitely not right, and I'm really not sure why this is even called a "cake".  What I was expecting was a nice, sweet fluffy mango mousse, but what I ended up with was two glasses of a very unpleasant looking glop. After it set, I tasted a spoonful to see if I could get past the strange curdled texture and unpleasant color (it turned a light brown color), but I couldn't even send it down. These were supposed to be dessert to our Valentine's Day dinner, and they went straight down the garbage disposal. Sorry for the harsh review, but it really was inedible!
