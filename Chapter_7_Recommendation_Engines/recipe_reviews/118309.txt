This is really nice. I didn't measure anything and I changed it around a bit; I snipped a bunch of dried apricots and put them in a saucepan. I covered it with water and simmered for about two hours, then mashed them, then simmered for a bit longer. I omitted the cinnamon and stirred in a bit of honey with the almond extract. I served the jam with scones and it was wonnnnnderful.

I used vanilla extract instead of almond, which changed the recipe quite a bit, I know, but it was delicious. I simmered the apricots longer than 25 minutes, probably around 35, because they weren't "mashable" at 25. This was my first time trying to make a jam or jelly, and I loved how it turned out.

An excellent no sugar, no pectin recipe...quick and easy too!  I used the really good, full-flavored California Slab apricots (not the Turkish-Mediterranean ones) and they mashed up just fine.  I used only 2 1/4 cups apple juice and I'm glad I did...would have been too runny otherwise.  I also cooked the jam for 35 to 45 minutes to reduce the liquid further.  I increased the almond extract to 1/2 teaspoon (surprisingly, because I don't like a strong almond flavor) since I couldn't taste it at all.  I put the jam in 2 half-pint jars and processed in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.  Will double or triple the recipe next time for gift giving.  Thanks!

I really liked this.  I spread it on the Apricot Oat Muffins from this site, and it was really good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but found that after simmering there was still ALOT of liquid in the pot, so i took out about 1/4 cup, then used my immersion blender to create a smooth consistancy.  Very tasty, but next time I will use a little less apple juice.

I order Apricots from a apricot "farm", thus they always come in by the pounds. This recipe was great for getting rid of some of them, and I used it in the apricot cream cheese bars recipe on this site. Pay attention to the no sugar added, because this equals tart! I like it tart, but some others may not. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out tasty with a perfect consistency.

Very good.  I would use 2 cups of apple juice instead of the 2 1/2 cups.  I mixed half of the batch in the food processor and the other mashed down a little bit and mixed the two together so that there was some texture.

The taste is amazing! I used canned apricots and just blended them, cooked and added the almond and cinnamon. I'd definitely make it again! I did add some sugar to my liking though.

What a wonderful recipe similar to apple butter, but far quicker! I liked it a even more before adding the cinnamon and almond extract, so I'd recommend tasting it before adding them. I also found this to be too thin after cooking and mashing, but I suspect it will thicken upon cooling. A definite keeper.

Very good.  The almond extract gives it a nice amaretto flavor; bordering on too rich!  I upped the cinnamon, too.  The apple juice does indeed make this extremely sweet, so perhaps going with part water would cut the sweetness.  But extremely easy, and will make a nice gift for the holidays!

Very simple recipe and it turned out yum even with tweaks. I used water instead of apple juice and vanilla extract as I didnt have almond. Still turned out great - enjoyed it with home made corn bread! Thanks :)

I used fresh apricots because I had a whole bunch.  From the other reviews it seemed this recipe is pretty flexible.  I wasn't sure how the dried fruit compared to the fresh fruit, and it already had some juice, so I just covered it very liberally with apple juice.  It is VERY tart, so I added some honey.  I cooked it as long as it said and maybe a little longer.  I thought it might thicken on cooling but it didn't seem to thicken up much.  I have it in the fridge but I'm pretty sure it's not getting any thicker at this point.  I think it will taste good though - tried it before it cooled off.  Wasn't sure how much vanilla an cinnamon to add because not sure how much fruit.  I think that's pretty flexible though.

I altered the recipe and got great reviews. My dad ate his pint in 3 days. He was recovering from chemo & radiation treatment, it was an easy food to eat ( on bread ). I only had 2 cups of fresh apricots, so I added 1/2 cup fresh, frozen cranberries. Instead of apple juice I used apple cider and about 1/4 cup of orange juice. Kept the rest of ingredients as is. The family loves this recipe. Now I need an apricot tree! I also sealed the jars in a 10 minute boil.
