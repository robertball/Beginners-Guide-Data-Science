I made these almost as written.... I was out of almond milk so I used regular ole 2% milk. My family devoured them and wanted more. The recipe only made 7 waffles so for large families like mine the recipe would need doubled.

I made this exactly as written and they turned out perfectly. They are slightly crunchy and have a delicious nutty flavor from the different grains. I have a standard waffle maker and this made about 4 waffles. Thank you for the recipe!

Yes, I will make these again! Healthy and tasty is a win! I did grind up the oats in my food processor first to a flour or meal consistency only because one child will not eat anything with visible oats in it (even cookies, crazy, I know). And I only had on hand strawberry flavored sweetened applesauce, and it worked out great. We ate these with traditional syrup and also our typical "strawberry syrup" - which is just some frozen strawberries heated a couple minutes in microwave and then pureed in the blender, with a little sugar added if needed. I think it's the healthiest breakfast that both my boys will eat. :)

My husband and I loved them.  Kids will eat again, but of course prefer my much-less-nutrition regular waffle recipe.  

The only thing I didn't do per recipe was I had to use oil because I didn't have applesauce on hand.  They turned out great in my Belgium-style waffle iron.  Also, we sprinkled chocolate chips on top right out of the iron so they were melted when we were eating them.  That was a yummy highlight for my kids.  

I would recommend eating with fruit and whip cream instead of syrup.  It takes a lot of syrup to sweeten them and I prefer not to ruin such a nutrition packed waffle with so many calories.

These were yummy! A few revisions I made- I used banana in place of applesauce since that's what I had, part coconut milk, unsweetened shredded coconut, and some cinnamon and nutmeg. Was delish!

What an excellent recipe did not have applesauce so substituted it with oil also did not have whole wheat flour so used Bob's pancake and waffle mix and did not add baking soda. Got raving reviews from every family member. From now on this is a recipe for making waffles that are healthy!

These are good. Not super sweet, but can stand alone. I did change the whole wheat flour for spelt flour. I would definitely recommend oiling your griddle, at least on mine they were pretty sticky.

These waffles were delicious! I will take these multigrain style waffles over the typical restaurant made ones any day! I substituted pumpkin for the apple sauce and used more chia seeds instead of the flax and they still came out perfect. Will definitely keep this recipe in my repertoire forever.

Very tasty.   The chia seeds provide a nice crunch. I substituted a teaspoon of Truvia for the 2 teaspoons of sugar with good results.

These were great. I didn't have applesauce, so I used part butter and part oil, but less qty than the amt of applesauce called for. I also used part white and part wheat flour for my personal preference.

I made the recipe as stated, perhaps a little extra applesauce but only a tablespoon or two more.  I thought they were great as I like a hearty, fill you up substantial waffle that is on the healthy side.  I had planned to use these both in the traditional way but also to make breakfast sandwiches.  They are just too thick for making a sandwich out of.  If I were to do this I would thin with extra milk to get a thinner, lighter waffle.   My son, who really has a limited palate, wasn't impressed.  Today he said they were too dry as they soaked up all the syrup before he sat down to eat.  He'd prefer white, unhealthy waffles of nothingness.  Too bad, he won't be finding those in my house.  I'll make these again, but for picky-pants, I'll try making them thinner and maybe that will work better for him - he still won't be completely satisfied but I'll feel better. For the rest of us, I'll try this again as I'd like to think they are providing a good base to start a morning.
Froze extras, warmed in microwave and then popped in toaster to get a little crispy on the outside.  Although, they didn't even feel rubbery or limp out of the microwave.
Just remembered that I used up my last sprouted whole wheat flours and sprouted flax in these so they were nuttier smelling which also can be picked up  on by teens who prefer processed food.  Some day, maybe he'll appreciate my efforts.....

Perfect waffles. I made them the size of a typical toaster waffle, using my ice cream scoop to measure out, and I got 14 of them. I have a traditional waffle iron. Love the ingredient list, used Swerve sugar replacement and egg beaters, otherwise no changes. They freeze well and toast up great. I am one to keep trying all sorts of recipes, but no need to look further really, it is a great replacement for the ones that I have been buying. Thank you, will make often to keep on hand.

I made this substituting mashed banana for the applesauce. I loved it and I'll use applesauce next time, and maybe peaches after that.

Just made these today and they were a huge hit! The husband, 6 year old, 2 year old and I loved them. Only change was swapping out 1/4 cup of flour with one scoop protein powder. Used my griddler waffle plates and scooped 1/4 cup batter for each. Made 12 delicious fluffy waffles. Oh! I also 1T maple syrup instead of sugar and we ate them without additional syrup. Wasn't needed! These will be a weekend regular for us. Thank you for this amazing recipe!!!

I love a hearty waffle! I made a couple subs based on what I had on hand and they still turned out great: whole flaxseed instead of flax meal (tried to grind and just didn't work out), dairy milk (whole) instead of almond, quick oats instead of rolled, and oil instead of applesauce (this works better for my waffle maker too -- no fat and it'll stick). I also did about a tablespoon of sugar, but they're definitely not too sweet. Love the crispness. I froze them and reheat them in the toaster oven -- just had one with some homemade apricot jam :) great!

Made 6 med size waffles. Made as directed using homemade applesauce and added some cloves and cinnamon. Topped with freshly sliced strawberries and a dollop of fresh whipped cream. Amazingly delicious...a definite addition to my brunch staples. Oil the waffle iron in between each waffle and if waffle pulls apart, cook an extra 30-60 seconds until cooked through. It will release with no problem.

That's some kind of nutritious waffle. Scant sugar and salt and it still tastes good. Might stand more a'sauce. They freeze well and remain moist when thawed though w/o the exterior crunch when they are hot off the waffle maker. They could end up part of a savory dish w/ the right accouterments. I like sweet toppings w/o HFCS.

I didn't have almond milk so I used 1%. I had several skeptics in my kitchen, including myself. Everyone, including my 2 and 4 year old gobbled them up!!! Be sure to grease the iron every time, as they will come apart in the middle if you don't when opening the iron.

This is a great recipe. I made exactly as written. I made the whole recipe and had 4 waffles leftover. I put them in the fridge in a ziplock bag and put 2 in the toaster the next day. They smell healthy and taste great, both fresh off the waffle iron and out of the toaster. Definitely a keeper.

The are light and soft with a rustic nutty flavor. I spread a little of my homemade nut butter and then topped with a bit of my homemade strawberry jam. Delicious!

My whole family loves these waffles.  I use oat bran instead of rolled oats so the consistency is a little more smooth.  I've found that a tablespoon of coconut oil also adds some lovely flavor.  One note - to avoid having them tear apart in the middle you need to cook them all the way through or make sure your waffle iron is well oiled.  But the waffles are well worth it!

Great, healthy recipe. I used some spelt flour in place of some of the whole wheat flour and added some cinnamon. I only had 1% milk, too. Waffles came out great. This recipe is a keeper. It's easy to make.

Healthy Multigrain Chia Waffles Haiku: "Used two-percent milk, instead of the almond milk. Earthy & filling." I didn't change anything in the recipe other than using moo-milk. I had to really geyser on the syrup to enjoy these. Baby gobbled hers dry in little cubies. My DD had hers w/ Nutella spread on top. The verdict is they are filling, slightly nutty tasting w/ a peculiar, but not unpleasant subtle crunch from the chia. I liked them, and froze them (just straight wrapped tightly in plastic wrap - didn't do as cook's notes instructed), and they've translated very well from freezer to toaster since then.

These were wonderful!! I didn't have almond milk so I just used regular milk and I added a touch of cinnamon to the batter just because we like it! I'll definitely make these again and again!
