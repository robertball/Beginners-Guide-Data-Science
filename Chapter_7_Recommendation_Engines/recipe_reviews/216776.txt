Pretty good! I didn't have fresh green beans so I used a can of drained beans. I also added slivered almonds to it. The chicken could have more flavor. I think next time I will marinate the chicken pieces in the lime juice and ginger and see how that turns out.

Good and easy if you're in the mood for thai flavor and don't want to go to a lot of trouble. Unlike another reviewer I could tell that my family needed more chicken and less salt from the beginning so I made those adjustments. Will make it again.

My family really liked it! If you like spicy you should increase the red pepper but this amount was perfect for my "no spicy" kids.

Well there was way too much pasta and not enough chicken. Extremely salty and I over salt everything. It was honestly not good and I don't think anyone actually made this before posting it.

doubled everything except for the pasta and green beans and cooked it all in the slowcooker. cooked frozen chicken on high in the sauce for four hrs and then on low for two. threw in frozen green beans in the crockpot towards the end. the fresh ginger really makes this one. ran out of coconut milk so used 1/2 coconut and 1/2 almond milk. recommend using 1/4 the amount of pasta half the amount of green beans and half the amount of the milk/sauce mixture (although hubby loved drinking it) Next time I would add an extra tbs. of lime to enhance the citrisy-flavor. Thanks for sharing.

it was pretty good. It reminded me of thai green curry chicken. Would make again. I added a whole tsp of red pepper flakes but it still wasn't very spicy perhaps because the flakes are old.

Awesome sauce recipe! I've tried this with pork tenderloin butternut squash ravioli and chicken thighs. Totally versatile recipe totally easy and totally tasty. I didn't change a thing with the sauce. This will be in my favorites:) Thanks for posting

I used frozen haricot vert and tossed in some shredded carrots I needed to use up. I do think this needed more red pepper flakes some other veggies along with the green beans and I think rice noodles might be better..at least for me

I followed the recipe exactly. I found there was too much pasta for the amount of sauce. Next time I will cook the beans separately then add them to the sauce. Then serve the pasta separately so that people can get more sauce. The flavour was okay but it would benefit from sweet chili sauce and a bit of peanut butter.
