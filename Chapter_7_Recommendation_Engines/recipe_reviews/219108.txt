Great taste. We loved them. Next time I think I'll mix the dry ingredients first for better distribution of the black pepper. A couple of the wings were a little on the peppery side.

We really like the crust on those wings.  My husband said that those are the best wings I've ever made.  I served them with Ranch dressing.

6/17/2012, made it again.  The whole family still liked it.  My children asked for the second serving and my husband again said that those are the best wings ever!  We skipped the ranch this time, no need.

These were great. I've been looking at this recipe for a while and finally gave it a try. Glad I did. I did not use the white pepper but did not adjust  the black to make up for it. I also did not add the cayennne. I coated in oil first then I mixed together all the dry ingredient except the flour which I sprinkled and coated last. I baked in a large glass baking dish coated with extra spray. No sticking at all and they were awesome.

Excellent wings!  I lined a sheet pan with parchment, good thing because they kind of stuck and would have been a mess to clean up.  In the video Chef John used a silpat liner which I am sure would have worked better for non stick but I didn't want to clean even the silpat.  I served these for the Monday Night Football crowd and there was not a single one left.  I did add some granulated garlic and onion powder.  I mixed up the spices and wings without the flour and held them in the refrigerator.  Just before baking I sprinkled with the flour and tossed them to coat them well.  The wings were nicely carmelized and took about 45 minutes total.  They held well in a chaffing pan for over an hour.  I am going to make this with chicken thighs - I bet they will be great.

I used this recipe for July 4th of this year and it came out great. However, I prepped a lot of food on the 3rd and decided to marinate these chicken wings. For approximately 25 wings and legs, I used all the ingredients except for the flour. I added them to a zip-lock bag along with 1/3 cup soy sauce and about 1/3 cup store bought Italian dressing (just enough liquid to cover a little over half of the chicken in a gallon size zip-lock.) I marinated them for about 4 hours turning them every 45 minutes or so. EVERYONE in attendance asked for the recipe so I decided to post this comment.

My husband LOVES these!  Made them today and was going to serve them later for the Super Bowl, but we've already eaten them so I will have to make more later.  I saw your video on "how to eat chicken wings" so I served them with Russian/thousand island dressing.  They made them so tasty and different!

These turned out really good!  Baking them on parchment or a silicone baking sheet is essential in my view.  Great taste!  Definitely a keeper.

Everyone loved the wings, though my husband was initially skeptical with the idea of chicken wings tasting like Pastrami. Luckily, he loves pastrami so he was willing to try it and ended up loving the flavors, same as our picky 9yr old boy! Making these again for sure! Only change was adding granulated garlic & onion. :) excellent!

6 stars for this :-)

I have a favourite "santa fe" spice mix for my wings.. 

I used 1/4t of dried habanero instead of cayenne in this recipe.

SImply the best wings I've had in a while.  They get crispy without being crunchy.

Love this !

Great recipe - a definite "keeper"!  I followed the recipe with these two exceptions.  I omitted the cayenne.  It seemed to include enough pepper without that and the result was pleasantly spicy without burning.  I also cooked it slightly less time and will definitely reduce either the time or the temperature the next time I make it.

Delicious! I mixed all dry ingredients together including the flour and put on the oiled chicken. I covered and refrigerated for an hour before baking. Turned out perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  The most I enjoyed about this was I had coriander and smoked paprika on hand!  I used chicken shoulders and back cut into bite sizes instead of wings and ground up whole coriander in my trusty mortar and pestle, not to a fine powder but with some...body.  I also added some lemon pepper because I'm a fan of lemon and chicken.  The dipping sauce I enjoy is honey mustard. These will most definitely be made again!

We like spicy so we use extra cayeene. . They are even better if you season them, vacuum seal (or put in a ziploc) for 24 hours (have even frozen them at this point)I have never baked them, they are great grilled!

Made it exactly as written even though the reviews about it being too spicy made me nervous. Well it wasn't too spicy it was Delicious! The whole family agrees. It took very  little time to prep and cooking time was spot on. You make magic in the kitchen Chef John thanks!
P.S. I know its not the healthiest but this with sushi rice and a little bit of pickled plum sauce drizzled on the rice....forgetaboutit!!!

I just finished these and personally I do like the flavor, a little spicy but just not crunchy. Which is why it is 4 stars made them as per the recipe.  I would certainly do them again.

I'm so glad I found this recipe. It's very simple and the outcome is delicious. They smell wonderful as they're cooking too. Will definitely continue using this. Only thing I skipped was the cayenne, white pepper and the flour is optional.

Just made this recipe for a football-watching Sunday afternoon and YUM! My husband called them "delicious." I will make these again, even for dinner with a salad. We didn't have any ground coriander so I used whole seed and crushed them with a rolling pin - this worked fine, but I used a lot less than the recipe called for as the crushed seeds were very powerful. I also coated the wings with the oil first, then sprinkled the pre-mixed spice blend, then the flour. I then placed the wings in the parchment paper and allowed them to stand in the fridge for about 45 minutes to an hour to make sure they were nice and dry so they'd crisp up in the oven. They came out awesome!!

Oh man these wings are amazing. My husband was so in love with the seasoning he made me use it four days in a row. I used it on thin cut pork chops, turkey wings and bone in breasts. I will be making this again for thanksgiving, christmas, superbowl and any chance I get in between.

Mmm yummy! These wings have a hint of pastrami but don't taste anything like pastrami (confusing right!?!)! 25 minutes in the oven on the first time before I flipped them worked for me. The second time was about 20 minutes. So those were some tips and those wings were a hit at the Super Bowl party!!!!! Thanks!

I was looking for a different kind of wing rub to make. I like mine crispy. This one caught my eye. Very good and very easy to make and very unique. I got a "You can make these again from the hubby". Thank you.

I made this the other night and I loved them! My wife loved them too. She normally doesn't care for spicy wings but when asked would you eat these again she instantly replied Yes!

Luv these wings! Have been making them since I stumbled onto the recipe on a different website. The only change I make is to cut back on the peppers. I'm not a big fan of pepper and neither is my 7 year old.  Other than that these are awesome!

Update: I have been making these wings for at least 6 years now  and they are still easy and still delicious. I line my cookie sheet with foil for easy cleanup and use parchment paper over the foil when baking these wings so they won't stick to the pan. My family loves them. This recipe is very versatile. Sometimes I use more or less of the spices and even swap out some of the spices like the coriander if I am out of it. I may substitute a rub if that's what I have. It's all about your taste preference.

My family can't get enough of these.  I grill the wings instead of baking.
