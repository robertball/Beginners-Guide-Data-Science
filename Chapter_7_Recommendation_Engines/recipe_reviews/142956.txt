Love all the ingredients individually which is why I made it. Usually, the smell of food in my crockpot drives me wild.  This one had no aromas at all. The absence of seasoning in the recipe should have been a tipoff. I managed to salvage the vegetables by removing the brussel sprouts and boiling the rest down in a saucepan to intensify the flavor.  I seasoned with salt and pepper and a tablespoon of olive oil.  Made a puree out of the sweet potato, celeriac and rutabaga in the blender. As for the turkey leg; if you enjoy boiled meat, go for it.
