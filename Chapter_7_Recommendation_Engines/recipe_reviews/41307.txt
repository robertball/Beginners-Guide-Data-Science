I didn't have a 9-inch square pan, so I used a Bundt pan instead. It was fine, but I needed to bake it about 45-50 minutes. The cake has a good flavor, the custard texture is sort of spongy. The apples and nuts add a good texture, and the cake is not overly sweet. I'm not sure if I would make it again.

This recipe reminded me of the bread pudding my mother used to make for some reason. I added a lot more cinnamon and a bit of ginger to each 'layer'. I also added some cranberries as I had some left over. I still found it bland..not what I expected at all. I found it to be quite a heavy dessert without being sweet so perhaps if you're not much of a sweet eater this will appeal to you.
