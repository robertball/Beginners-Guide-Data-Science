I have to say this was delicious.  I added a few extras - instead of kidney beans I used can of corn and a can of sliced new potatoes.  I also used more hamburger meat and ranch style beans with jalapenos instead of plain pinto beans.  We garnished with crushed corn chips and shredded cheddar.  This was a big hit around here -- got eaten all up by my hubbie and his friends over watching football.  This was also so easy and I need easy with my four month old demanding constant attention.  Thanks so much this is a keeper!!!!

I thought this was great.  I've made it before without the ranch dressing mix but the ranch really adds flavor to it.  Serve it with corn chips and sour cream.

Excellent tasty soup!  We really enjoyed this and it smelled so good while simmering.  I used only pinto beans as thats all I had.  Hubby minced half a jalapeno, and we also added some chopped carrots and celery for more veggies.  I used diced tomatoes with jalapeno, but it was not too spicy for us.  I put in a can of beef broth and this made a huge pot!  Glad we've got it for lunch now!

Oh my I love this soup!!!  I used ground turkey though and omited the oil....didn't see reason to use that, and I buy my taco seasoning and ranch dressing in bulk at Sam's Club, so I threw in about a 1/4 cup or so of each *shrugs*....I also threw in some hot sauce for that extra zing....boy is this good! Top with shredded cheese.  Mmmmmm.

This thick soup was a hit at my house. I did put in 1 can of beef broth, 2 cans of tomato sauce, left out the bell pepper, and added 1 small can of diced jalapenos. I also added a small package of frozen corn. I found this was a very easy recipe, although I did fry the beef, onion, and jalapenos together (I think the taste and texture of onions comes out better when it's cooked with beef rather than boiled.) before dumping everything into a big pot and simmering for 1/2 an hour. At the end I served it with diced avacados, grated cheddar cheese, and sour cream. mmmmmmmmm.....I think I need another bowl.

really good - I've been making this for quite some time and it is quite a bit better in the crock pot - excellent! Also, if you don't have a taco seasoning packet on hand, the taco seasoning recipe on this site is great!

This was a terrific (easy to make) soup with lots of flavor.  I added a second can of green chilies to give it more kick.  I will definitely make it again!

My husband absolutely LOVES this soup.  It's one of his new faves.  I've made up multiple batches of this and frozen it in mason jars (remember to leave head space at top of jar).  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

My family thought it was average. More like chili than a soup.I had to add extra water to the recipe (3/4 cup). Worth trying at least once to see if you like it.

Yum! The only change was a can of diced green chilies instead of green pepper but that is just a personal preference. One of my favorites!

I make this exact same recipe but don't add the tomato sauce.  Instead of kidney beans, I add a can of hominy and also a little chopped green chile pepper.

This is pretty darn good. It does seem more like a chili with a really good kick to it. good for something a little different.

My husband and kids LOVE this.  I make it with a can of black beans and a can of ranch flavored pinto beans, top it with a dollop of sour cream and some shredded cheese, and eat it with chips.  Yum!

It really was more like a chili.  I think it was because it had so many beans.
The croud really liked it though.

Made this in the crockpot which was very easy b/c all I did was brown the ground beef and onions first then put everything else in a crockpot. Alot like chili, but a little different. Will make again.

Will make again, great combination of flavors. I used 1 less can of the chopped tomatoes, tomato sauce and the pinto beans because I didn't buy enough! Still tasted great. Cheese and tortilla chips really finished it off.

This soup is pretty tasty. I did make a couple changes. I added some diced jalapenos for some extra spice, a little bit more ranch than called for and about 3 cups of corn. Topped it with shredded cheese and sour cream! Next time I'm going to sauté the onions with the beef  because mine were a little more crunchy than I like.

It was very good but I use  taco season ground turkey instead of beef.  I also use cayenne pepper, chili powder and diced green chile pepper to spice it up a little.

I made this recipe tonight with an addition of extra meat, can of corn, and a can of Rotel. My husband said it was acidic but if you top it with sour cream it takes care of that for the most part. I thought it was good. I didn't have any tortilla chips to top it with so I fried up some cut up corn tortillas. It was good. I would make it again.

My kids picked out this recipe.  I told them I had ground beef, onions, and tomatoes on hand, and this was the recipe they picked.  They cooked it on their own.  They are 11, 9, & 7 years old.  They loved it.  I may have had better soups, but this is  a keeper!

I added corn and some red pepper for kick.  Otherwise too bland.  Loved the rich tomato flavor.

This recipe is great. It is quick and easy for busy mom's and the kids and my husband loved it and even ate the leftovers the next day for lunch! This has turned in to a regular meal at my house!
