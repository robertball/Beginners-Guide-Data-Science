Really great summer dessert. I cut down on the sugar/calories by using FF cream cheese, FF sour cream, FF whipped topping, and only 1/4 c. sweetener in the actual "cream" part. For the blueberry sauce, I used half of a quarter cup of sugar and subtracted a tsp. of water so I could add a tsp. of lemon juice. It was plenty sweet for me. It was almost like a strawberry summer cheesecake without the crust. I'd make this again but I think I'd only use one 8 oz. package of cream cheese because I think it overpowered the other ingredients.

This was a very good recipe. I halved it and used a smaller pan, following the recipe for the main part of the dessert as written otherwise. For the topping, I was a little confused, since it's called blueberry sauce, but originally called for raspberries. I pointed this out the first time I reviewed this recipe, and the recipe was changed. My review was also deleted. It was originally a 4 star rating, but is now a 5 star. I did change the topping somewhat. Instead of blending, I added a little cornstarch to the mixture to thicken as it cooked. Delicious.

This was good. We liked the blueberry sauce on top. Next time I will leave out the sour cream - we didn't like the flavor.
