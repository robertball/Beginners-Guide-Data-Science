When my husband said, "This is really good, excellent" for the third time, I figured I better give it 5 stars. It is so easy to make and the taste is deliciously different. I used 1/4 cup organic dark brown sugar as I don't believe Splenda is all it's cracked up to be and I wanted an earthier flavor.

This was very good! I tried it this evening. I used frozen whole green beans, a tad bit more soy sauce while cooking, and let it cook a little longer to ensure the green beans were done. I also used beef stips (stir fry beef) instead of ground beef. Served it on a bed of brown rice. It was really good! Two thumbs up!

This was a super quick and easy recipe, enjoyed by me, my husband, and our teenaged son!!  
I chose to substitute Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage in place of the beef.  Everything pulled together nicely, and resulted in an interesting taste combination.  I'm sure I will be craving this in the future!

My daughter loves green beans and she loves beef. I was excited to make this, but she wouldn't even touch it again after the first bite. I thought it was terrible too.

I didn't have enough soy sauce for this recipe so I cut the amount of brown sugar I used. We had it with brown rice and it was very yummy. Can't wait to try it again with the right amount of soy sauce. Oh and I used all organic everything! Cheers to your health! :)

Needed something quick and healthy.  This was perfect as I modified it and the kids loved it! Used 2lbs of beef, 2 cans of French style green beans and substituted dark brown sugar for Splenda.  Kept the measurements for the soy sauce and brown sugar at 1/4 c each to tone down sweetness.

Easy way to spark up the ground beef.  Super simple.
