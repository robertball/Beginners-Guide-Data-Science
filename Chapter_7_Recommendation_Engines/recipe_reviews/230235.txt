I haven't tried it, but I am Swedish and I want to offset the 1 star review. I suspect Rosemary hasn't tried it either. I hate to see senseless ratings based upon close-minded opinion rather than actual taste testing. I will try them with the Italian bread crumbs. Also, Gross and definitely are spelled as I have shown here.

I would also like to offset the pointless 1 star review. Looking merely at the name of the recipe, I dont think that the purpose of this recipe was to take it to Sweden and try to pass it off as an authentic culinary phenomenon...Thats why it says Swed-"ish"...its just the style...thank you.

Made these for a family get together before Christmas, they were a large hit, full of flavor and the nutmeg/cinnamon gave them that holiday oomph!

Our family enjoyed this recipe.  I misread it and didn't have enough time to use the crock pot, so I browned the meatballs in a skillet and finished in the oven, making the sauce while they were cooking.  When the meatballs were finished I added them back to the sauce and served over egg noodles.  I did end up adding 1/2 tsp garlic powder, a tsp of mustard, 1/2 tsp paprika, and black pepper to the sauce, as well as using fresh mushrooms and doubling the sour cream.  If I make this again I think I'll double the sauce for the noodles I served it with!

Who cares whether the recipe calls for Italian bread crumbs.  The taste is what counts.  Quite being so critical ROSEMARY 14.  Isn't Rosemary an Irish name?

AWESOME!!! I didn't look at the recipe well at the grocery store and didn't realize I needed to slow cook them, but I made them in a skillet and made the sauce. I healthily'ed these up with 99% ground turkey and turkey sauce. Still amazing!!!

I would like to start out by saying I only used the meatball recipe and they were delicious. The family loved them. My best friend who is an amazing cook herself came over for dinner and loved them. The only change I made was to use beef with a higher fat ratio since my best friend has a pork allergy. There were no leftovers which is saying something since my family is made up of picky eaters, who all like something different. Thank you for sharing a new family favorite.

Wouldn't make it again. Didn't thicken up correctly. I tried adding cornstarch and then they just tasted like cornstarch

It is cooking right now, and have "taste tested" and it tastes great.  I did do some changes.  Not big, just what I had on hand and things that I wanted to use.  I used all beef (it was in the freezer and I didn't want to go out);  I didn't use the cinnamon but used cardamon instead.  For some reason I have two open bottles of cardamon, and saw that it was used in another recipe from another site instead of cinnamon and as my cinnamon is running low I used that.  

The sauce, I really did differently,  but followed the main directions.  I used the mushrooms, added some onions, did the beef broth, added a can of cream of mushroom soup, did the cornstarch,  doubled the sour cream, added a touch of lemon juice, some cardamon, a touch of a1 sauce, and parsley and a shake of paprika. As I said, I taste tested and it is good, sitting in the oven at 225, will have it over noodles, and brussels sprouts.  I probably read 40 recipes and would have changed other recipes much more than I changed yours.  I have yet to meet a recipe that I haven't changed in some way.  I can't resist.  Thank you for your recipe.  I have saved it and I'm sure we will enjoy it again and again.

I also did not realize this was a slow cooker recipe; however, I browned the meatballs in a skillet & then baked them for 20 minutes in a casserole dish while making the sauce and served over noodles.  I doubled the sauce and my family loved it.  I will make it again.

I made a few changes and it was wonderful!  I cooked the meatballs in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes rather than frying them.  I then simmered them in the sauce for about 10 minutes.  I made it once in the slow cooker and I feel like it didn't need to be slow cooked.  Slow cooking it actually made it have less flavor - we liked it better just simmered in the sauce.  Excellent  comfort food recipe !!!!

I put more than a pinch of the cinnamon and nutmeg so it was too strong so that was my fault.  But the sauce was not thick like I expected.  It was runny and greasy like.

I think my pinches must have been a bit too much on nutmeg so that was my fault. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.
