I used clementine oranges because I had them, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious and easy, will definitely make again.

I used black rice and pecans and it was a family hit! I'll definitely make it again.

My family loved this recipe. And they thought they didn't like wild rice! I served pistachios on side due to allergies.
