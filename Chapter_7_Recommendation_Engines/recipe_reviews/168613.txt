Fabulous recipe! If you love guacamole, then give this recipe a try. I would have never thought to grill an avocado before, but this really did give the guacamole a nice smoky taste! I cut the recipe in half and used minced garlic with a bit of kosher salt vs. garlic salt. I also added a bit of cumin and I loved the creaminess the sour cream added to this. Overall, a wonderful recipe especially served with warm tortilla chips!

Made this for the Super Bowl yesterday and it was AWESOME!!! Put the avocados on the grill until they got some brownness and were soft and warm. Very tasty!!

I have made this recipe 3 times now, it is awesome! Only difference I do is white onions not red, no jalapeno, and I use ro*tel original diced tomatoes and green chilies. I also grill up the avocados in a skillet on my stove with a little olive oil. It taste so good and I will continue to make this guacamole recipe for years.

Grill ALL the veggies and omit the sour cream (there is really no need for it as avocados create a creamy consistency all their own, especially after cooking)! Grilling all the veggies makes this a truly grilled guacamole and will impart so much more flavor it will blow your mind! I would not grill the tomatoes of course, and I would use 1 clove of fresh minced garlic for a more vibrant flavor. :)
I also prefer to use seeded, chopped roma tomatoes in guacamole, but that is a personal preference.

I really liked the grilled avocado but did not care for the sour cream.  I'll make it again, but this time l will leave out the sour cream and add more hot sauce and garlic.

This guacamole has great flavor. Guacamole is one of my favorite foods of all time. Because of personal preference, I left out the following: jalapeno, sour cream, hot pepper sauce, and cilantro. I squeezed fresh lime juice from key limes and used vine-ripened tomatoes. Loved it! 4 stars only for alterations but would give 5 for taste.

This was awesome. I didn't  have all the ingredients so used rotel and a little margarita mix. The grilling made it have such a unique taste. This will be a new staple here.

I think this is a case of "don't mess with a good thing."  Grilling took a bit of the fresh taste away from the avocado, though I hesitate to say it tasted smoky.  I also didn't like the sour cream - especially reduced fat!  Overall, it was OK.  But a stellar guac can be made with much less effort.

Although this idea seemed like a great one and I really wanted to use it to show off our new grill, it just did not add any flavor to grill the avocados.  Served at a dinner party and no one noticed any difference.  When I finally broke down and mentioned the grilling of the avocados, someone said they thought they could taste a smoky flavor, maybe.

Perfect! What a great idea, grilling the avocado. At first I didn't think there was enough jalapeno but it turned out great. The only thing I changed was that I use diced romas in place of the cherry tomatoes. Thank you  maddysmom. This will go into my TNT folder.

Left out the sour cream, but loved the flavor that grilling the avocado gives to the guacamole. Next time I'm grilling the tomatoes and the jalapenos too.

Fantastic recipe!!!  I am a big guac fan and this one tops them all!!! My little twist to it was that I grilled the tomatoes and the jalape√±os and used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Wow what a hit with the family!!!

I loved the smoky flavor of this guac!  I used Heirloom tomatoes which made a nice presentation.  We served it with Carne Asada Tacos and also ate it with chips.  Great both ways.  This is a fun and tasty recipe!

I used jumbo avocados, so this turned out larger than I expected so I had to add a bit more lime juice and salt than the recipe. I also did not have any sour cream, not sure what impact that has, but the guac came out great anyway.
