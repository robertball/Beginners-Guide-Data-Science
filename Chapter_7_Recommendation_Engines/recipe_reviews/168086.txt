This was very different texture wise. Everyone loved it. The kind-of caramelly flavor and chewy texture of the crust really adds a different spin on regular lemon pie. I always get asked for the recipe.

I tried this with lemon pudding and we didn't care for it. So we tried it again with butterscotch. Much better. The crust has a caramel flavor that does not match with lemon.
