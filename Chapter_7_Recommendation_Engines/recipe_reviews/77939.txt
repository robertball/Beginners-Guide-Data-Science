This was an excellent recipe for someone who has never before tried parsnips.  I used 1% milk instead of half and half and the soup was still lovely and thick - the perfect food for a snowy winter night.  I will make this again.

It's difficult to find recipes for parsnip soup and this one was lovely!  I didn't have  cardamom or all spice & I used a bit of fresh ginger root in place of ground ginger but it still tasted it great.

A wonderful soup - it has officially become one of our Sienfield 'soup nazi' soups!  Because I used more parsnips I upped other ingredients, but I found that I used much more chicken broth than the recipe called for  - it was very thick.  I used fresh ginger instead of ground and more garlic and cayenne pepper (we love garlicy, spicy food).  For garnish, being that we didn't have hazelnuts and cranberries in the house, I sauteed sultanas and walnuts in a touch of butter.. it was fabulous! Thanks for this recipe!

This was a fantastic soup and easily converted to vegan! I had a pound of parsnips to use up and I'm glad I chose this. Pan roasting the parsnips made them incredibly sweet. I could have skipped the sugar, but I did add extra cayenne to counter  that a bit. I also made this a SUPER LIGHT version by using unsweetened almond milk, no butter and homemade vegi broth. The cranberries are A MUST as they add the bitter depth this soup lacks, while the toasted hazelnuts add fantastic texture and depth. Like other reviewers, I chose to thin this out quite a bit, but the bf liked it thick ( I guess it depends on personal preference, so I won't knock off a star for that!)

This recipe doesn't get a 5 because I had to thin it with water because it was so thick, and the cayenne kicked the heat up too much for my kids to like it.  Next time I'll make it without the cayenne; I think the ginger is heat enough.  Overall it's quite a good recipe, though, and the garnish is a great addition.

I omitted the allspice, used a little heavy cream as well as half and half, and I garnished with snipped chives. Absolutely delicious! Thanks so much!

My irish boyfriend could not believe that I had turned  a vegetable he hates into such a delicious soup! I omitted the allspice and used heavy cream instead of milk. I also used only 2 cups of stock because we like our soup very thick. The dried fruit make a great addition!

I used whole milk instead of the half and half and a few canned pears, it turns out just like my favourite soup at a restaurant that I frequent.
There is nothing better than a bowl of this soup on a cold winter day, thanks for the great recipe!

By happy accident, I splashed some Oyster Sauce into my bowl of parsnip soup - it made a good soup even better! Add to taste, as I have no way of knowing how much I splashed into my bowl and how that would translate to the whole recipe.

Already had the parsnips/onions cooking when i realised I couldn't find my Curried Parsnip soup recipe. None here either, but this one is a fine replacement, except for usual substitue ingredients(no cayenne, so used paprika; no ground giiner, so used pieces and so on).

Delicious and quick! Comfort food with an exotic blend of flavors. Will definitely make again and again. I didn't even have any allspice; was still excellent. But trusting the writer I'll buy some for next time.

I would not make this again...ever.  Had made it for company and in the end threw some steaks on the BBQ and didn't serve it.  I'm not sure what all the other reviewers ate.

This is a very nice soup, but I found that apart from parsnip (obviously), the other flavours were warring with each other a bit. It just came over as spicy parsnip, which was a bit disappointing after all the work! I will make it again though, and I may try fresh minced ginger and no allspice, as this I think, might have been a little overpowering.

Had this with Waldorf Salad w/walnut oil vinaigrette (also from this site). It made a great meatless dinner, light and perfect on a blustery fall day. Don't skimp on the sauted nuts and cranberries--it's a yummy addition.

This was fun to make and delicious! I used fresh ginger instead of powdered ginger and cinnamon becuase I didn't have any all-spice.

It's like Fall in a bowl! And I agree with others who reviewed that it really can be enjoyed by those who have never tried or don't think they like parsnips. I followed the recipe,  except made all spice as I didn't have any (cinnamon,  nutmeg,  and clove). Will Definitely make this again. And again.  And again.

The flavor on this was unique, and honestly a bit overpowered with ginger.  While it was an interesting use of parsnips - and I love creamy parsnip soups - I wouldn't necessarily make it again.  The flavors were a bit too pronounced to be truly memorable in a good way.

I thought this recipe was fantastic and it's the only recipe i've reviewed!! I don't cook with cream or milk, so instead i whisked a tablespoon of flour (i used spelt flour, as that's all i had) in 1.5 cups of water and also, I used 1 tsp of fresh grated ginger as well as the 1 tsp of ground ginger the recipe called for.  It had a fantastic ginger kick.  i will definitely add this to the regular soups i make.

This recipe is delicious, and a good use for some leftover parsnips I had sitting around. Its not quite five-star worthy, but it does come close. I think maybe next time I'll omit the pinch of sugar - its a touch too sweet for my palate otherwise.

Everyone I mention this soup to seems a little frightened by the combination of Parnips and Ginger but as soon as they taste it they change their mind! A great soup, easy to make, and very, very tasty. Careful you don't over do it with the ginger. I make this using organic veggies and fresh organic ginger - gives a better taste in my opinion.

Truly awesome soup! I used 1% milk instead of half and half -- it worked fine! The cayenne adds a wonderful, subtle bite to complement the sweetly spicy vegetableness. This one's a keeper!

This would have been a great soup had it not turned out so sickeningly sweet. If I make it again, I'm going to add a potato.

Awesome!  Due to food issues and what was on hand, of course i altered a bit.  I subbed 2 leeks for the onion, and added with the garlic (which i increased some).  I grated in some frozen fresh ginger, and also used the powdered ginger.  I omitted the cardomam and used potato milk instead of the cream.  Oh, I also put in the whole box of broth, which is closer to 4 cups than 3.

My family loved the soup!  Well, it was too sweet for my husband, but my teen daughter had 2 bowls of this and no chicken, and my 11 yo boy ate his whole bowl.  (Ok, he actually dipped some of his french fries in it lol)

If I could give this soup a million stars, I would!  So delicious, my first experience with parsnips.  Who knew they were so good? The only change I made was using all allspice instead of allspice and cardamom, and using dark brown sugar instead of regular.  thanks for great soup recipe for my work lunches!

Excellent taste, very easy to make. Used slightly diferent spices as I didn't have Allspice or Cardamom - will definitely make this again
