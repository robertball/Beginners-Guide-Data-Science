These taste sooo good! I personally prefer the rice krispie to be room temperature and the jam cold.

these were great and easy!  The first time I made the mI made them with Kashi cereal (for a healthier snack) and Sugar Free Smuckers.  They were good but very thick - too much so for my toddler.  The second time I made them with Cheerios (again for health reasons)and used a slightly larger pan.  That way they were thinner.  I used SF Jam again and sprinkled some semisweet chocolate chips (about .25 cup) on the bottom layer for added yum.  These were delicious!

Really yummy!  Excellent variation from the usual crispy treats.  I always add a splash of milk to my marshmallow mixture after it's melted...it assures that the treats will stay soft.  This will be one to make over and over!
