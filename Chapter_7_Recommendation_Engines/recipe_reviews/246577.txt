I made this "Pasta Rybna (Mackerel Spread)" using GRACE brand Mackerel in Spicy Hot Sauce (what I had on hand). I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company; however, it is not my personal taste. I can imagine if I knew which brand of fish to make this with, it could be much, much better. Thank you Jola for sharing your recipe.
