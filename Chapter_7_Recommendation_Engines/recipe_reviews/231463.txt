My family loves quick breads and this recipe was a huge hit. I had many bags of cranberries in the freezer and used one of them in this recipe.  I just added the 2 cups to the batter in the frozen state. I baked them in four (6 x 3 1/2) small loaf pans rather than one big pan.  This loaf is moist and packed with flavor.  I found that this is a very good loaf to freeze and it thaws nicely.  I will be making this one again.

Like it claims, this is very moist. Yum! Used frozen cranberries which works fine. The way the ingredients are combined per direction s is a bit different from the average quick bread, but I followed directions with no problems. I did lightly dice my mandarin oranges. Note that I used my largest loaf pan and there was too much batter for it. It was right to top and was fearful it would poof and go all over my oven. So I ladeled out some and put in a prepared small loaf pan. My cooking time for both was longer than stated, so just keep an eye on it. Tastes amazing!

I made it exactly as the recipe says and it turned out delicious!  So moist, a little tart from the cranberries, and super sweet from the mandarin oranges and sugar!  I will definitely make them again!!

Eventhough I have my favorite cranberry bread recipe, I tried this one.  'Never used orange extract before & trying to get fruit in the children, I went for it.  :)  1 3/4c sugar seemed like a lot of sugar - more like the amount for a cake, or two loaves.  Yes, I admit it, I reduced it to one cup.  I stopped myself from other changes except for oven temperature.  Oh, I didn't do the fruit & sugar topping thing.  Oh, & I only had a cup & a half cranberries.  Hey, it's all I had that were useable!  :D  Oh, yikes :D, I changed the directions: Creamed the butter & sugar, added the eggs.  Combined the milk & sour cream (which I think could be subbed for buttermilk it would seem).  Added the extracts to the milk mixture then added that to the combined dry ingredients.  Folded in the berries & oranges.  9x5 loaf pan, 350 the whole time, an hour ten.  Sum up: Not as good as my regular cranberry loaf by carol.  This one is a little dense & moist enough.  A cup of sugar was fine.  If I were to play with it, I'd probably increase liquid/fat & add another egg or baking soda/powder.  It makes a big loaf.  There aren't really enough oranges or cranberries (yes, I had half cup less).  'Should't be as fruity as fritcake, but more could be used for sure - at least in my opinion.

I made this bread for Thanksgiving, and it was so good it didn't even make it through the day! Bursting with fresh flavor and super easy to make. Now I have to brave the store for a second batch of ingredients!

Very moist and flavorful bread!  Although I did sub yogurt for sour cream I don't think it altered texture or flavor too much.  Also, this is the first cranberry bread recipe with the berries scattered on top with sugar sprinkle and that really made it taste over the top!  Thinking I'll toss other c'berry bread recs and stick to this one, so thanks for the post zeta724

This bread is delicious! It certainly took longer to cook than the recipe stated though. Mine was in for well over an hour. I didn't like how the recipe called for this to be mixed together. My batter turned out lumpy after mixing melted butter with dry ingredients. Next time I will combine ingredients in a manner I am more familiar with. Overall this bread was awesome. I will be preparing it for a church function next month.

Despite all the liquids it was not moist.  No oil means it dried out very quickly.  Not that I like them very oily like at the grocery store.  Not orange enough and fresh cranberries made it very tart even with all the sugar.

I find making any kind of cranberry orange bread to be a bit disappointing. They never quite come out the way I want them to, but I really liked this recipe. It was moist and delicious and a hit with everyone who tried it.

This is absolutely best cranberry bread recipe I have ever tried.  I did not have enough milk, so I have used butter milk and it turned out beautifully. I have also used clementine pieces instead of canned fruit. Winner!

This was a good recipe--the hubby and daughter liked it too.  Made recipe as written, BUT took into account other reviewers about baking time.  Thought I had left in long enough, but center still slightly doughy--needed still more time in oven.  Froze most for church social--used extra large loaf pan.

Just finished my second batch of this bread.  It is fantastic.  Followed the recipe exactly the first time and my kid was asking about when we would make it again before it was even gone.

Overall very good with adjustments.  The quantity and baking time on this definitely need to be adjusted.     This makes a lot more than 1 loaf. I made one large and one small loaf.  Baking time needs to increase to about an hour. Even my small loaf had to bake about 50 minutes.

I made some minor changes to the recipe.  I chopped my cranberries in my food processor.  Next time, I will use the mandarin orange juice in place of some of the milk.

I can't say as I followed the instructions to combine everything exactly. I mixed all the wet ingredients and dry ingredients separately and mixed together in my mixer.  The mixing 'chopped' up the oranges so I didn't have large chunks.
