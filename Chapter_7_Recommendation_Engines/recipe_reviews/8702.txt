This was a excellent version of the Chicken a la King I used to eat as a child. I added 1 1/4 C milk and 1/4 C flour and it turned out perfect. I also added peas and carrots.  This is so quick and easy....it's a must try!!!

The sauce is thick and pasty.  I believe there is a typo in the recipe.  I think the milk should be 1 1/2 cups instead of just 1/2 cup.  This would make total liquids comparable to other recipes.  Also the taste is somewhat bland.  Perhaps the ad-dition of 1 tsp worcestershire sauce would jazz it up a little.

I added an additional cup of milk, it was too thick using only 1/2 cup. I also added 2 tsp of garlic powder to enhance the flavor and added a small can of drained peas. Overall, it turned out great.

I wanted something different than our usual sauteed veggies, chicken, and rice.  This was just as simple and very good.  I used the whole 1/2 cup flour and 2/3 cup milk instead of 1/2.  I had extra broth on hand in case it needed thinned but it turned out fine.  I added onions and extra mushrooms and just salted and peppered to taste.  Everyone thought it was great!

Ditch the pimentos and green peppers and replace with mixed vegetables (corn, peas and carrots - I use a bag of the frozen variety). This is the recipe I remember as a kid and it turns out great.

I cut this recipe in half, since I was only cooking for two.  Good thing, because after I added the liquid to the flour it was way to thick.  I also think there was a mistake in the recipe, it should have called for 1/4c flour (not 1/2).  I didn't have bell pepper so I used onion.  I seasoned my chicken with Tony Chacheres before cooking it in a pan with butter.  Along with the pimientos I added some peas.  It turned out great!  I am looking forward to cooking this again.

I really like this recipe - reminds me of my childhood, having lunch with my mom and sister.  I omit the rice though and serve it over a slice of white bread like mom used to do!

This is a great recipe for using leftover chicken.  Didn't have the bell peppers or pimentos.  Had to add and extra cup of milk (making a total of 1-1/2 cups).  As other reviewers stated, 1/2 cup flour may be too much.  Also added 8 oz frozen mixed veggies.  Nice easy dish to prepare...thanks for the recipe!

Good, simple delicious recipe.  I did tweak it a little and used fresh mushrooms, peas, broccoli and diced carrots.  I ended up using a little less butter and more broth and milk.

Delicious, uncomplicated & it turned out well.  I substituted 1 large can (drained) chicken breast for the cooked chicken.

Very good! As other reviews recommended I added extra milk but it was still very thick. It had amazing flavor and was a big hit. I will make it again with more milk.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and went very smoothly. The only changes I made was to add fresh garlic (we like a lot of it) and some cayenne pepper. I also cooked the chicken in the leftover chicken broth.

My one complaint was like the others it was too thick.  I was thinking it was my fault becasue I had no chicken broth so I used boulion powder as I have it on hand always and used all milk and some cream for the liquid.  I added water until I got it at the consistancy I liked.  The other changes I made was I used one 6 oz can of Albacore Tuna as I had no chicken on hand and I added a small amount of frozen peas.  I thought the dish had good flavor like I remember a la king should taste like. I put it over the rice.  I'll make a note to reduce the flour next time, I will make this again.

This came out good.  I only used 2 TBS. butter with the mushrooms, red peppers and some diced onion.  As other reviewers suggested, I cut the flour to 1/4 cup.  It still came out thicker than we liked (maybe due to the lesser amount of butter), so I added a bit of white wine, along with more chicken broth. I served it with mixed veggies over puff pastry shells.

My husband who was a cook at the time,  use to make this dish for us back when we were Newlyweds (29 years ago). Times were tough for us back then so it was all we could afford to make! haha


Just recently, I have been craving this dish & asked him to make it for me but, he cant remember how to make it * he's now  an HVAC mechanic who makes lots of money so that's probably why he has a memory loss! ;-) I saw this recipe and it sounded as close to the one he used to make so thought that I'd give it a try. Well, I started off making this following the author's directions to the letter & I too found that the flour measurement given was way too much!!!!! Thank goodness I poached my chicken breast & reserved all the liquid * was saving it for my dogs* because, I had to add a good 6 big soup ladle scoops of the broth to finally get this to a manageable consistency *not to mention, I also threw in a half wine glass full of my CA Blush Chablis*!! ;-[] Well, that saved the consistency but, it still was lacking flavor so...thew in some seasoned salt..more pepper...a half tsp. of jarred minced garlic, paprika & a dash of dried parsley flakes. Hopefully, I now have what taste like I remember? I will post a photo of the finished product at a later date ~Bon Appetite~

Everyone else here seemed to enjoy this, and it was really simple to prepare and had a nice presentation with all the different colors. We've never had chicken a la king before and didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be like an open faced chicken pot pie deal, but it was really not at all. the white sauce had a nice texture but I had to add more chcken broth as it was much too thick. It seemed rather bland and too green peppery tasting plus had no wow factor. I only used 1/2 a green pepper, but it still seemed to have a dominant sweet pepper flavor, but maybe that is what chicken a la king is supposed to taste like? I didnt't like it and scraped it off my biscuits but the rest of my family ate theirs and seemed to like it okay. I doubt anyone here would miss it if I never made this again.

Really good, but I think a bit too much flour -- a little grainy.  Substituting green onions for the peppers was also FABULOUS!

Onion instead of mushrooms. No bell peppers. Another cup or so of liquid to make it thinner.

I made this following the recipe except I added peas instead of green pepper.  I served it over rice.  There wasn't much flavor although I used both chicken broth and chicken bullion.  Usually I can 'rescue' a recipe if I feel it won't be tasty but this was beyond saving.  Won't be making this again.

Good but not as much flavor as I would thought. I was then advised by some family to add a beef bouillon cube to the mixture with it dissolved in a tablespoon of water and it added so much flavor and did the trick. Add the beef bouillon cube and you won’t be disappointed.

We loved the flavor of this recipe. For me the green peppers and pimentos are a must to achieve the flavor of  chicken à la King. It may be a little thick but that is easily remedied with additional milk.

Had to cut back on the flour at the beginning and add more milk at the end to thin it out some more. Used some frozen peas and carrots, cut out the bellpepper.  Served open faced over bisquits.  Very tasty.

I made this recipe as directed with 2 exceptions.  My son is allergic to dairy, so I substituted non-dairy margarine and soy milk for the butter and milk.  I used 1 c. of soy milk as suggested by other reviewers and found the sauce to be just the right thickness.  I served it over egg noodles and my family really loved this.  I will add diced onions the next time I make this flavorful dish.

This dish is a personal favorite, so I was pleased to find a "soupless" version to try.  I liked it, but I think I'll try some things when I make it again.  I had a "real inferior" white wine, & I'm sure that made some difference.  A little "Food Trivia" came to mind, as I was fixing this dish, since the recipe submitter (Thanks SO much for the recipe!) mentioned Today, about the "origin" of the dish.  There are at least 7 different opinions about the origin  of "Chicken a la King" today (according to "Google" Food reference.com), however, 60 years ago, it was referenced in Britanica that it was named in 1888 for a very wealthy gentleman who's name, was  E. Clarke (of course), "King", by a Chef in Brighton Beach, New York.  The dish was my very favorite "dining out" dish (1952-1964, when I got to taste Lobster!), and when my teacher assigned us an essay about something we had done & loved over Easter Break,  looking up the origin of this dish was a shoo in!!  We had just gotten our encyclopedia set (complete with mahogany shelf unit), but this ""version" was the only reference at the time I checked there.  That was 60 years ago, and I got an "E", with a small ding about "padding"...I'm surprised I can remember so clearly, when I can't remember what I ate for lunch today !!!  Hope you enjoyed the little bit of "Food Trivia"!  I'm going backto Google to see what else is out there that I DON't know!!!

I make this dish fairly often for my family.  They absolutely love it.  We eat it on Texas toast most of the time.  I follow the recipe as is except for the addition of celery salt to season the meat with when I cook it.  To me it makes it taste very similar, albeit better, then the canned version.  I also just use red and green bell peppers and leave out the pimentos since all they are is red bell pepper.  I used to make it exactly as written but have altered it to these changes over the years, and it's delicious!  We all love it. I always quadruple the recipe and we eat it for a few days.

This is the recipe I go to as the base for my Chicken a la King.  I'm glad I make it a habit to read the reviews each time I come here so I'm reminded about needing to add more milk.  1 1/2 cups brings the sauce to the right consistency.  I add more Better than Bouillon -- chicken flavor to make the sauce even more "chickeny".  I've always preferred using red bell pepper to the limp pimientos.  I think it adds texture and color.  I also sometimes throw in frozen peas.  Yes, I change quite a few things with this recipe, but I always look for this particular recipe to start with.  Just wish the author, Lillian, would return and fix that "1/2 cup of milk" thing.  I'm giving the recipe five stars, overlooking that one problem.

This is a good basic recipe, and easily adapted to your tastes. Like many other reviewers, I too had to add a considerable additional amount of liquid to make it my desired sauce consistency. I added both milk and broth, as well as a splash of white wine. I used fresh mushrooms as in the original recipe, but also added about a cup of frozen green peas. Served over biscuits, delicious comfort food.

Was OK. Chicken A La King sauce is supposed to be fairly thick, but this seemed to lack flavor. If I do it again I would maybe add some garlic. Maybe do cream of mushroom with a little more milk instead of the broth & milk.

The whole family really enjoyed this recipe. I added season salt, garlic powder and herb mix to add some zip. Also did the peas and carrots to sneak some veggies into the kids. I stuck with the 1/2 cup of milk which made for a nice thick, rich sauce which we really liked, all a matter of personal taste if you prefer a thick or thin sauce. Will definitely do again.

I really liked this dish. It was such a throwback to my childhood. I did tinker with it a bit with  alot more chicken broth, more veggies: peas, carrots & fresh spinach and some splashes of Worschestire Sauce for flavor and tone down the pasty white color. My husband loved it and will definetly make it again...probably with a gratin.

I changed it based on reviews, 1.25 cups milk, and .25 cups flour. I also used fresh ground whole wheat flour.

I used the whole can 14 oz can of chicken broth and increased the milk to about 1 cup. Otherwise, it's way too thick. I also added about 1/2 cup of frozen peas instead of pimentos with the chicken. Very good, will serve with frozen egg noodles next time.

Very bland recipe, it took a lot to season it up. The sauce was very thick and pasty even after thinning it out.

I had not thought about Chicken a la King since my college days (almost 30 years ago), when it was a staple. But earlier this summer we had a family event and my sister-in-law requested that I "cook up some of that chicken thing you used to make when we were kids". This recipe came pretty close to how I remember making Chicken a la King, so I followed it to a "T" (except quadrupled) and presented it to 4 generations of skeptics and critics. It was good -- very good, as a matter of fact -- and to my surprise, very well received. A couple of weeks ago, my elder son asked me to make it again. Which,  naturally, I did -- except that time, I reverted to my old recipe, using chicken boullion cubes instead of broth, frozen peas instead of green pepper (canned peas get too mushy) and canned mushrooms instead of fresh. In addition, I stirred a generous sprinkling of high grade Hungarian paprika and a couple of Cayenne pepper flakes into the pot at the same time I added the chicken and pimentos. Fortunately, I had doubled the recipe because we all had seconds. (I always liked Chicken a la King over rice, but next time I think I'll serve it over egg noodles for greater "density").

This was pretty good.  I added chopped onion and celery and sauteed.  I also cooked the chicken breast in the boullion/water to help flavor it.  I eyeballed the flour and made a roux type thing and also eyeballed the milk.  Pretty good and pretty easy.

This was very tasty but the measurements are off. I had to add quite a bit more liquid to equal out the butter/flour mixture.

Everyone really enjoyed this tonight Lillian. I added garlic and onion powders and a sprinkling of cayenne. Didn't measure the flour; just kept adding until it looked right. Served this over homemade biscuits. Thank you!

i LOVE chicken-a-la-king and have tried many different recipes, this one is by far the best, not too thick not too running!
