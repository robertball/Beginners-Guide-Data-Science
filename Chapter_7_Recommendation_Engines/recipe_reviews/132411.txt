This was amazing!! The flavors BURST in your mouth! However, I did make a few alterations just because I honestly can't help it. Here are my alterations: 1.Cut the recipe in 1/2 to serve 2 people, 2. When sauteing the red pepper, asparagus & garlic, add garlic last. Minced garlic doesn't take long to cook & you def. don't want it to burn or it will ruin the dish, 3. Used button mushrooms (thats all i had on hand-worked out fine) 4. Sauted veggies in EVOO & a little butter, 5. After flatening the chicken breast, I seasoned the outside with onion powder, poultry seasoning, & black pepper & little seasoned salt, then rolled up and returned to same pan I cooked veggies in to brown both sides of chicken (also added about little EVOO to pan before putting chicken in), 6. For the sauce on top-I deglazed the pan by adding about 1/4 cup chicken broth to pan & scraping all that good yummy stuff at the bottom, let reduce for about 1 minute, then added the entire can of cream of mushroom soup. I skipped the milk & added about 3 tblpns 1/2 & 1/2. Also seasonsed the sauce w/about 1 tspn poultry seasoning & onion poweder, dash black pepper & little garlic salt. SO GOOD!! Loved it!

this was very good, however i tweaked some of the steps/ingredients. i also added some worcestire and a little bit of fresh grated Parmesan cheese to the mushroom sauce.  also be careful which kind of mushroom soup you use.  i didn't even need to use milk.  the kind of creamy mush soup i got was the perfect consistancy.  i would recommend not adding the portabellos in at the same time as the peppers/asparagus, they cook quicker, wait a little bit.  i also sprinkled some olive oil on the chicken before putting it in oven. i too, served it over rice.  my boyfriend's a chef and really enjoyed it.

Impressive and easy dish.  We will make this for company, but will substitute cheese for the mushroom soup to add a touch of elegance.  Excellent blend of flavors.

I added feta cheese to the rollup and it was delicious! I also added some worchestershire sauce, as per the reviewers' advice. Adding worchestershire sauce mellows out the saltiness of the mushroom sauce.

This is a recipe with great potential. I did use pepper (and the salt) on the chicken as well as in the sauce. We did like this recipe a lot, as we love asparagus and mushrooms. I served it over white rice. But , the next that I make it I will brown the chicken in a little olive oil and add some worcestshire or other spices to the sauce for a little more flavor. Otherwise, a great recipe. Thanks for the idea!

These were awesome! I sauteed the asparagus with 1 Tblsp minced garlic. Instead of 1 cup of milk in the sauce I added 3/4, and I also added a couple splashes of Worcestershire.

Wife and family loved it.  Some differences to the original recipe: *Added chopped onions *Added more garlic. Added some late to the saute as well as raw to the wrap. *Browned chicken wraps in same pan veggies were cooked. *In the same pan sauteed (what ever fell out  of the chicken wrap)  onions, mushrooms, garlic then added cream of mushroom. Season with salt and pepper.  Served over brown rice

What I did different: I put about 3-4 tablespoons of garlic instead of what it called for. I put Season All on the chicken, in the veggies while sauteeing, and in the cream of mushroom sauce. I used an orange pepper and a red pepper. I added Feta Cheese when I stuffed the chicken. I put Season All, about a tablespoon of garlic, and a teaspoon of Kitchen Bouquet in the cream of mushroom sauce. I couldn't ask for a better recipe!!!

The vegetables had a great flavor. The chicken was very, very bland. We did not add the milk to the cream of mushroom soup, as it would have been WAY too watery.  I would make this again, but I would marinade the chicken breasts first. The mushroom soup does not add enough flavor to compensate for unseasoned chicken.  I think this recipe would be 4 or 5 stars if it was re-engineered a bit.

This recipe has great potential. The filling was wonderful, but despite trying to doctor up the cream of mushroom soup, it was what it was. I will make this again, but look for a more creative sauce.  I think browning the chicken in a skillet before baking might also help. I look forward to reading other reviewers suggestions.Very easy, very quick, very pretty.

This recipe was very easy!  I added some salt, pepper and olive oil to the chicken itself before rolling and a couple of splashes of worcestershire sauce to the cream of mushroom soup for some added flavor.  My boyfriend loved it!

Boring. Not seasoned enough, and just tasted bland. Dumping soup over this just makes it tolerable-that isn't the way we like to eat. Won't make again.

Loved this recipe.  I used a package of prepared thin sliced chicken breasts to save time.  I also used regular mushrooms.  Used three asparagus spears per chicken breast.  I also added some Worcestershire sauce.  I used a can of golden cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular can.  We really enjoyed this recipe and I will be making it again.

This was good dish, and my boyfriend loved it, but I think the cream of mushroom soup overpowered all of the other delicious flavors. I think next time I might try a less potent topping, so you get more of the great flavor in the asparagus, peppers, and mushroom.

Loved it with a few additions: after pounding the chicken breasts, I seasoned them with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Once rolled up, I drizzled some EVOO over the tops of the roll-ups before baking. For the sauce, I added a half a can of milk to the cream of mushroom soup and some Marsala wine and Worcester sauce to taste. This is a great meal to serve at a dinner party!

This recipe was sooooo good! I've been looking at it for a little over a year, so I figured it was time to finally try it. I was shocked on how easy it was to make. Very yummy. My fiance said it's his new favorite. :) I did add salt, pepper and onion powder to both the chicken before cooking it and to the mushroom sauce (and a few sprinkles of worstershire sauce). I omitted the asparagus and added green bell peppers.
