A bit complicated to make. There are also a lot of rare ingredients in this cake that you'll buy specifically for this and then may not be able to use up for anything else before they expire on you. Best tasting cake recipe I've made. Doesn't particularly have a strong dragon fruit flavor, but it tastes pretty good anyway. The frosting is very sweet , so if you're not a sweets person I would recommend just using a store bought frosting. Overall very good, I was so pleasantly surprised and proud when it turned out so well.
