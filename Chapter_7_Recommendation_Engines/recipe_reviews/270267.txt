I made it as printed, but my method is lazy. Used a 16 oz container of egg whites, added whole bag of chopped spinach, drained and squeezed dry, and bag of Mexican shredded cheese.  (I'm not good at measuring. ) Plus the spices.
I did add one whole egg.  Came out really good and delicious!

I have made this recipe several times now and we love them! Mushrooms are a great add-in. I have found 1 tsp of salt to be more than enough, so last time I used .75 tsp and that seems like plenty. Also, I found that the muffins had a tendency to stick to my (nonstick) tin, so I have been using muffin papers and lightly spraying them before adding the muffin mixture.

Delicious and Light! I was scared of the hot sauce making it spicy and it did not...at all! I added sautéed cut onions to it and it was delicious.

Made it according to recipe...too bland. Made it again with chopped onion, green pepper, and bacon. Also garlic salt. Much more tasty!!!

I made this and my daughter loved it. I added Shredded pepper jack cheese rather than the shredded cheddar cheese. I would have to lower the salt because the cheese is salty already.   The next batch I make I will add bacon to it to make a quiche Lorraine.

I left out hot sauce only and used Monterrey jack cheese instead. I added a tiny bit of bacon bits.  They were amazing .  Will definitely make again and again! ??

Easy and quick to make. I halved the salt and still found it too salty. (I cut down on salt several years ago in lieu of my late wife's heart condition.) I will make these again but I will use only one-fourth the amount of salt and add a small amount of allspice or nutmeg.
