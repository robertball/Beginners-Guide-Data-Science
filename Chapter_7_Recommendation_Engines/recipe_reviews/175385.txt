Fabulous dressing and a nice fruity twist on regular balsamic vinaigrette!  I added a little more raspberry preserves and a pinch of sugar to reduce the tartness but overall it was delicious and perfect over "Strawberry Spinach Salad" from this site.

This dressing was tasty and easy to mix up at the last minute.  I didn't have raspberry preserves, but I did have blackberry, so I used that instead.  I also added a little bit of garlic powder.  I served it over chopped green and purple cabbage with shredded carrots, chopped red peppers, chives from the garden, toasted slivered almonds, and fresh blackberries.  My husband raved about it!

Fantastic dressing! I have no idea why there is sodium listed since all the ingredients I used were sodium free... which is exactly what I wanted! Every dressing I have come acrooss is loaded with sodium and I gave up trying to find a truly healthy, low fat, low sodium dressing and decided it's time to make my own. This dressing is awesome. I added just a few drops of honey to cut the "tart" taste and it was all it needed to make it perfect. I had spring mix salad with strawberry's, cucumber, yellow pepper, celery, and grape tomatoes. It was spectacular!

This is a keeper.  Good bye store bought, hello homemade.  Made as written with the exception of the salt and pepper which I added to taste.  Delicious!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, janiceliv.

We liked this very much! I had to add a bit of honey to it for my preference. I'll probably make this a lot, changing up the flavors with the various preserves/jellies/jams I always seem to have an abundance of. Ate it tonight on a salad of spring greens, real bacon bits, shredded Parmesan, Craisins, and homemade croutons. It was luscious! I'll probably add real onion to it next time, either fresh or dehydrated, just because I like that flavor so much :) Thanks for the recipe!

I guess I'm the only person so far who *really* didn't like this recipe.  I followed the recipe as written (other than S&P to taste) and thought it was unappetizing in appearance (muddy brown) with an unpleasant taste.  Actually, the taste was kind of muddy too.

Having bought the raspberry preserves just for this recipe, I tried again using white wine vinegar, 2 TBS raspberry preserves, about 1 tsp honey and omitting the onion powder.  *Much* better -- pretty pink color and clear flavors.

Didn't have raspberry jam so I used low sugar strawberry jam.  Didn't have enough sweet taste so I added 2 teaspoons of honey, which seemed to do it for me.

This gets 5 stars from me even though I changed it a little.  Since a standard vinaigrette is a ratio of 3 to 1 (3 parts oil and 1 part vinegar), I thought this might be a little tart and it was.  I added about 1 t. of honey and that did the trick.  I served this on a salad made of red leaf lettuce, green onions, mozzarella cheese (I wanted to use feta, but I was out), toasted almonds and fresh raspberries.  It was delish and pretty too!

Great on strawberry salad. Can chop a green onion in place of onion powder and add a tbsp of poppy seeds.

This was pretty darn good! I forgot to buy balsamic dressing at the store so decided to try & make some. It was surprisingly easier than I thought it would be! I left out the raspberry because I didn't have it & hadn't planned on making dressing. Instead I replaced it with honey & added a little bit of fresh garlic. It was great!!

I like that it takes such few ingredients. I tripled the preserves and used half balsamic half white wine vinegar. Beautiful plum color and great taste.

Delicious! I did need to add a bit more of the raspberry preserves, but other than that I followed the recipe and enjoyed it over a salad of mixed greens, strawberries, pecans, and feta cheese.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This was awesome, though not as healthy as I like, a little goes a long way, so if one moderates the volume a little, it's not so bad. Plus, it's made with olive oil (I used extra virgin olive oil), which is "good" fat. I really like the tart bite, mixed with the sweetness of the raspberry preserves. I used this as dressing for some green, leafy spinach and it rocked.

10 Stars! I am obsessed with this salad dressing on a WONDERFUL salad that I use it on-  ((I add frozen raspberries to the dressing as well)  Romaine lettuce, fresh spinach, thin apple slices, blue cheese, crutons and candied pecans or walnuts. I could (and do) eat this every day. It's AMAZING with this dressing!! The blend of all the flavors is like a song in my mouth.  Thanks for helping me eat healthier- I'm no longer burnt out on salad!

Didn't have the raspberry preserves so I used frozen raspberries with about 2t honey in a food processor. If using the frozen raspberries, I would start with 1 teas. honey and add more if necessary (my raspberries weren't very sweet).    This was deeeee-licious. Served over spinach, with cucumbers, goat cheese, toasted walnuts, (real) bacon bits, and blueberries.  Not the best pot luck dressing as it really dyes the greens and doesn't make the best presentation - but this is a divine dressing!  All my kids loved it and so did my company.

I added an extra tablespoon of raspberry preserves so the balsamic vinegar would not be an overbearing flavor as well as a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  Served with my own version of allrecipes' Raspberry Chicken Salad, it was delicious!

Delicious! I'm pregnant and was sick of the same boring dressings. I made this so fast and had a mixed baby green salad with candied walnuts, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. I'll be eating this dressing for awhile! Thank you!!!

Very good.  I added a 1/2 cup of fresh rasberries, a tablespoon or so of honey, and some water.  I put it in a blender and turned out great.

After tasting it per the recipe I wanted a bit more sweet, so doubled the jam.  That did it!  Nice, tangy flavor for the smooth textured spinach salad.

I was pretty displeased with this recipe. When the mixture was refrigerated, it became extremely thick and was not pourable.  The taste was way too strong of balsamic vinegar and not enough raspberry. I thought using the preserves was probably what made it too thick and chunky. It wasn't very appealing to look at either.

I made this as a marinade for salmon. I added 1/4 cup of frozen raspberries (thawed and smashed), 1/2 tsp of sugar and added about 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar. I added the salt but not the onion and black pepper. I was tasty and would be good for salad too.

Finally found the perfect dressing for my spinach salad! This was sweetened just enough by the raspberry jam (Smucker's natural, in my case) and balanced with the acidity of the balsamic.

I love this recipe! I did change it a bit. My local olive oil store sells a Raspberry Balsamic vinegar so I just used 1/4 cup of that and omitted the T. of raspberry preserves. Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee. It was excellent! My hubby and I both loved it! I served it on a bed of mixed greens and leaf lettuce with sugar snap peas (raw), chopped chicken from a rotisserie chicken and about a T. of homemade glazed walnuts. I will make this again and again.

I think I may be the only one who actually really enjoys a strong tart balsamic flavor. I doubled the balsamic and it tastes so delicious! I can see how it would be too strong for most, though. Thanks for the dehydrated onion suggestion! I'm totally giving that a try next!!!

It's good. Pretty much what I was looking for.   I omitted the onion powder and used less olive oil. I would have added more oil but was fine with about 1/4 cup.

I just needed a quick low fat dressing to put on my salad! this was good, but i agree some might think its not sweet enough, but thats an easy fix, there were some great ideas in the ratings of how to change up this recipe!  but since I'm watching my sugar, i like this one just like it is :)

This was really good.  I did add a touch extra raspberry (home made...mmm) and a pinch of powdered mustard.  Also, when I first tried it I tried to half the recipe...doesn't work.  Make the whole batch, it's good and should keep well.  The only other thing I did was put everything but the oil in, whisked it then slowly added the oil so it would emulsify and not separate.  It came out perfect!  And the longer it sits, the better the flavor.

I had an amazing raspberry dressing at this ridiculously expensive restaurant a few months ago and was looking to recreate it on my own.  This one wasn't it.  It was decent all by itself and a good alternative to bottled dressing (especially with a high quality balsamic).  The second time around, I experimented.  I added 1 cup vanilla yogurt (only because I didn't have plain), 1/2 cup raspberries and 2 teaspoons white sugar.  AMAZING!  Has that wonderful balsamic flavor but a creamy raspberry flavor as well.

Excellent salad dressing! I had some homemade raspberry preserves that my sister in law made and it turned out great.
