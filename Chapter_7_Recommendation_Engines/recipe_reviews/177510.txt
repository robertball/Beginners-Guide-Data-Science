I am giving this five stars, not because it's the best I've ever had but, because it was so easy to make and it still tasted very good.  I changed a few things to suit my craving.  I didn't want chicken in it so I used cut up mushrooms and onions to add bulk.  I sauteed them in with the bell pepper and butter until the natural moisture was reduced a bit.  I then added the soup but did not add milk because I like mine to be thick.  I eat it on toast so I didn't want it to be too wet.  This vegetarian method tastes just like if you were to put chicken in it.

This is a good base, but I imagine it would be quite bland on its own. I didn't have precooked chicken so I boiled two chicken breasts (next time I'd bake or sautee them). Even with the extra step it was very quick and tasted very good.  I minced two cloves of garlic and sauteed it with the red pepper. I then added the mushroom soup and milk. I didn't have enough milk (sad, I know), so I added a couple of tablespoons of sour ceam. I sprinkled in some onion powder, chili powder and a bit of cayenne; I also added some parmesan cheese. All that gave it a really nice flavor without being too overwhelming.  I didn't feel like rice so I used half a bag of wide egg noodles. During the last couple of minutes of boiling the noodles I added some frozen peas (maybe 1/2 cup). I tossed it all together in the skillet and then served.  All in all, the recipe serves as a great base but I think it needs a little help. I have a feeling my boyfriend will be requesting this again soon! I will make it as described above, except for cooking the chicken differently. Thanks!

I was trying to find something different to prepare for dinner.  This is a dish my mom made when I was young.  My family love it.  I made some changes - used Cream of Chicken; sauteed celery, red and green peppers, mushrooms; used a little chicken bouillon (with a little water) and pepper.  Served over rice.  This is a keeper.

This is one of the easiest, quickest meals that I have ever prepared.  Getting home late from a swim meet last night, I had some already cooked chicken leftover in the fridge.  Adding in some peppers, soup and milk was so fast and easy.  All of my kids really liked this one, and my husband and I also ate our share.  Probably not the best chicken a la king we've had, but for the effort and time required, it was perfect.  I had a little green and yellow pepper in the fridge, so I used both.

The chicken stayed really tender which I thought was great.  It is an easy dish which is something I look for.  Will be making this again.

This one is a big hit with my picky eaters.  I sautee cubed chicken with some garlic pepper adding some onion at the end and the flavour is great!  Thank you for a quick and delicious recipe!

I made this on a day where I didn't really have much on hand, but didn't feel like grocery shopping.  I used an entire orange pepper and an entire green bell pepper chopped up.  I had boneless chicken thighs on hand, so I used those too.  I sauteed minced garlic in butter and then added a chopped onion and the peppers into the pan.  Once they were tender, I poured them into a bowl and then added the chicken into the pan to let that cook.  While the chicken cooked, I threw some instant rice into the microwave and added the soup and milk to the green pepper mix.  Next time I would use about 1/3 of a cup of milk instead of the half cup.  Once the chicken cooked, I added it into the pepper/soup mix and everything was nice and warm since it was all just cooked.  I would definitely recommend adding additional spices into the soup mixture.  I added a lot of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  This is a simple quick meal that I would make if I had the ingredients on hand and wasn't in the mood to make an elaborate dinner.  I would have given it four stars for the way I made it, but the recipe as is should be a 3 star rating.  If you follow my suggestions you can have a four star recipe using very little ingredients, prep time, and not a lot of dishes for clean up.  I would only recommend this recipe if you are crunched for time, don't have a lot of ingredients in your kitchen, or have peppers on hand you want to use up...otherwise this is just an okay meal.

This is really really delicious.  I didn't use leftover chicken, I just cooked it in a pan with some butter, salt, and pepper.  I also served it over yellow rice instead of normal white rice, which adds a lot of flavor.  So easy, and so delicious!

Super quick and easy!  Also, very family friendly.  I used leftover turkey instead of chicken.  I made sure the chopped peppers were big enough for the picky eaters (my husband) to take out.  I served this over biscuits.  My husband had leftovers over mashed potatoes.  Great either way!

Amazing recipe!!!
Chicken a la King was my favorite as a child, and this, plus a few changes, brought back all those happy memories!
I added onion, garlic, and chili powder. Chopped onion, minced garlic, both red and green bell pepper. And due to allergies I used Cream of Chicken soup. 
Tasted great! Have made and will make many more times to come.

This recipe is very quick and easy.  Great for beginners and those of us who don't like cooking.  I followed the recipe and it turned out very good for a mid week dinner. I used boil-in-the-bag-rice for convenience.  It always comes out just right  I only recommend more seasoning.  It was a little bland. I just added salt and pepper.  It did the trick.  I had a second helping.
