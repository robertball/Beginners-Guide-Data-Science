I wasn't a big fan of this cake, not because it was bad, but because it's so nondescript. It's not particularly flavorful or even pretty or interesting to serve.  Adding a teaspoon of vanilla and a lemon buttercream frosting did little to overcome that. Simple it is, I'll give it that, but unfortunately this cake is completely forgettable.

easy, excellent. I made a couple of changes: 
substituted 1/4 c greek yogurt for 1/4c of the butter, added 1/2 tsp vanilla to wet mixture, substituted 3/4 cup whole wheat flour for regular flour, put in slightly less than a cup of sugar, and added 1/4 cup oats.

It's exactly what it says it is.  Very good, and very simple.  Having said that, I tweaked the heck out of it the second time I made it.  After I mixed the batter I added chopped walnuts (1/2 cup or so) and a chopped FIRM banana. Then, after pouring it into the pan I topped it with a standard streusel topping. Lemme tell ya... over the top!

I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon into the recipe for a little extra flavor, it turned out great :) A couple years ago I had this recipe for cinnamon coffee cake that was very similar to this and I used to add bananas to it. I lost that recipe when we moved, and this really reminded me of that bread recipe. Thanks for the post

This took no time at all to prepare. It was moist and delicious. I substituted the butter with coconut oil and the taste was fantastic. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 by 13" Pyrex glass pan and baked for @40 min.

This recipe IS simple.  Based on other reviews I added a tsp. of vanilla as well as 1 c. combination of fresh pineapple and walnuts to use up some odds and ends.  I wish I'd had flaked coconut to add because then you'd have a tropical fruit salad cake.  The timing is right, the consistency is right, loved it.   Seems I gravitate to these smaller cakes because there are just the two of us.  Thanks for posting.

This is a good banana cake, but the name is deceiving. This is by no means a coffee cake. It has a great taste and texture, looks just like the photo, and bakes exactly 30 minutes, as the recipe says.

This is a great basic banana cake recipe which does not turn out gummy and is mild enough to accept the addition of almost any add-ins....chocolate chips,coconut, nuts, extracts...a good clean-out-the-cupboards recipe.

This was wonderful, but I adjusted the recipe using recommendations from other reviewers.  I used 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of the white, added cinnamon, vanilla, and walnuts.  My crafting group loved it and my husband wants me to make it again.  I think next time I will also cut back a little on the butter - possibly 1/3 cup instead of 1/2.

I made this and used the alterations noted in Janshomecooking and using 1/2 wheat and 1/2 almond flour my family loved it and both my husband and daughter have asked that I make it for their office.

I made it for a card night and I was very pleased with the result. I added a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of walnuts. It was a easy and quick recipe, and one that I will make again. Best to make a day ahead for added flavor. The cream cheese icing was perfect too! Yum,yum!

Delicious, just followed the directions given. I used a substitute for the butter. It's a keeper and my go-to recipe when using up over ripe bananas.

super easy, super delicious! I took the advice of others and added vanilla. Just a word of advice, before you cover this bad boy with powdered sugar, y'all might take this recipe for a taste test drive. With a cup of white sugar and the sugar in the bananas it's pretty sweet. Otherwise, get baking!

This will be the second time in a week that I am making this addictive banana recipe.  I made the cake portion as is, just added some streusel and used a bunt cake pan to be a little more fancy.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I also used half the butter with 1/4 yogurt, added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla, added 1/2 c. chopped walnuts, and used 2/3 c.brown sugar instead of the white.  Also threw in a few chocolate chips for my son! Simple and good.
