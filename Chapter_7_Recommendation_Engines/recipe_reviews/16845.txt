Everyone loved this, but we all agreed it needed to be WAY more spicy.  I substituted cream cheese for half of the sour cream, used a packet of taco seasoning in the beef, and another packet in the sour cream / cream cheese mixture.  A half cup or so of canned sliced jalapenos as layer #8 makes this a lot better.  If you like guacamole, use about twice as much, because the recommended amount isn't enough to even spread out to make a whole layer.  You wouldn't notice if you left it out.  I'll make this one again; it's very good.

This is a very old standby recipe that has been served again and again with fantastic results! First of all, this recipe is fine as written and served, but our crowd typically likes a little more flavor and kick.  Differences that I would suggest is to brown your beef with a packet of taco seasoning (no water), 1.5 tbs of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder 1 tsp of garlic and 2 tbs of dried minced onion.  Added finely chopped cilantro with the black olives, tomatoes and green onions.  Mixture of pepperjack and cheddar cheese gave the dip more complexity than straight cheddar!  Superb flavor!!!

I recently had a party with some people who enjoy good Mexican food...and they DEVOURED this!  The key that made this 7-layer dip so successful is the LACK of taco seasoning in the refried beans.  I've used that in the past, called for in other recipes, and it's just not good to me.  I asked my sisters about it, and they've said they just leave it out because there's a strange after-taste.  We grew up near the border and had alot of great Tex-Mex, and this recipe SHINES above any other I've tried. I prefer not to use canned refried beans, rather to go to one of the local Mexican restaurants and get a pint of their beans--they're just better if you want to WOW your guests...something different about the texture. Texans close to a Pancho's know what I mean. If you don't have time to make your own guacamole, Walmart sells a good one put out by AvoClassic, plain or spicy in a box with two 8 ounce packages that you can mash a little more, or not. I took a Mexican cooking class while a student in Mexico, but many of these recipes are just as good...including this one.

Seven Layer Dip is a classic that you just can't go wrong with.  You can leave out any ingredient that you don't like, so it is easy to adjust for any taste.  I add taco seasoning to the meat after browning.  Warning though, if you add the water it will make the dip hard to scoop.  Just add enough water to disolve the seasoning.  I also add a jar of nacho cheese sauce to my beans.  I like them better that way.

This recipe deserves nothing less than five stars! I used homemade guacamole from another recipe on this site, replaced the salsa with taco sauce (we don’t like chunks of veggies), omitted the black olives and chopped tomatoes, and I added a can of seasoned black beans for more texture. This dip is excellent served hot – if you don't like the thought of eating cold food right out of the can, you can assemble the dip, minus the sour cream and guacamole, and pop it in the oven at 400 degrees for about ten minutes, then top individual servings with sour cream and guacamole. Delicious! I served mine up with guacamole flavored Doritos, it was a hit! I’m making it again this weekend!

Excellent. I omitted the guacamole and upped the sour cream to 16 oz. Added 2 TBS of taco seasoning to sour cream. Thanks!

This dip was incredible! There were only 4 of us so I cut the recipe in half and served it in an 8" square glass dish. I used the same amount of sour cream though and instead of using guacamole, I mashed 2 advocados with 1 tbsp lime juice. Also I added half a package of taco seasoning to the ground beef and mixed the other half of the package with the sour cream. My only complaint is that because this dip is so heavy, the nacho chips kept breaking when they were dipped in (and we even used the scoops ones) so it might be a good idea to keep a spoon handy. And don't forget the margaritas!

This is a great and easy recipe.  My family loved it, and always asks for it during family gatherings and holidays.  It's a little messy to prepare (especially for klutzes like me) but after assembly it is great.

To me, this recipe needs something else to give it more flavor and "depth."  I thought it was a bit bland when made as directed.  Update:  Today I made this again but with a few additions which did the trick for us.  Though this recipe is not designed to be a "taco" dip, it really does need something more.  Therefore, like many other reviewers, I added a pkt of Taco Seasoning mix (no water) & 1 tsp of garlic bits to the ground meat as I browned it.  I kept everything else the same (except omitted guacamole since we don't like it) and then baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  It was great served warm with Frito Scoops! I think the secret ingredient (besides the taco mix) is the blend of  Cheddar and Jack cheeses.  This dish makes a "pretty" presentation for the table.  BTW, if you do add Taco seasoning, do not add salt.  It will be too salty for most people.  Thanks DPerez7 for the recipe.

Wow is all I can say. . . Apply the meat while its still hot so it melts into the first cheese layer and really meshes. I also agree that seasoning the meat is the best way to go whether it be with taco seasoning or your own personal spices. Only other thing I love to do is to take all the veggies (tomatoes, olives, and green onions) and dice together well to create a beautiful and tasty mixed layer. You can either take it and apply it on top as instructed or what I like to do sometimes is whisk it into the sour cream to create a more creamy vegetable layer to use underneath top top cheese layer. . .

To me the qty of some of the ingrediants for a 9 X 13 pan were not enough.  I changed/used the following: 2 pounds ground beef, I browned the ground beef and then added Taco Seasoning like the previous reviews. 2 (16 ounce) can refried beans with jalapenos 1 (16 ounce) container sour cream  1 (16 ounce) container guacamole 2 cup salsa 1 cup chopped tomatoes 1 cup chopped green onions    I did not change the other ingrediants quantities.  All in all a good recipie...Thanks

I made two platters of this last night for a baby shower, and I had probably 10 people say something about the dip, and some didn't even know I made it so it made me feel so good.  Everyone ate it right up!! I made one with homemade salsa/pico sauce which was fast and easy since I already had the processor out.  (I just blended up a quarter of a purple onion, quarter of a white onion, a half of lime juice, about 2 shakes of salt, garlic salt, and garlic powder and a handful of cilantro...it was pretty fast.) It tasted so good and fresh that way. Make sure you add taco seasoning to the beans as well and I added a few drops of water to make the spreading easier. For faster assembly, buy already chopped fresh green onions if your grocer has it and canned chopped olives, not diced.  Roma tomatoes are more of a deep red so they look prettier.  This was a definite repeater!! Thanks! Priscilla

This is an excellent taco dip!  I had a favorite taco dip recipe, however this is now my new one!  I omit the guacamole and green onions, put the olives in a dish on the side for people who would like them, and use 16 oz of sour cream.  In addition, after I brown and drain the meat , I add one package of taco seasoning and a half cup of water and mix, with heating, until meat is coated.  THIS IS AN EXCELLENT DIP, but it doesn't last long :)!

This is always a big hit whenever I serve it.  I do add a packet of Taco-Bell brand seasoning to the ground beef (as directed on packet).  I also use Dean's brand quacamole dip (in the dairy case) instead of true quacamole.  I also use sliced black olives rather than chopped.  I like the presentation better.  I also use fat-free refried beans ~ MUCH easier to spread than the traditional ones.  I have made this so often, that I've learned to adjust the quantities of sour cream, salsa & guacamole (dip) to taste.  You really would have to try hard to mess this up.  In my book, it's a tried & true hit!

Delicious, however I prefer to add taco seasoning to the meat but not the water called for when you make taco meat. You can also make this with cooked chicken breast meat instead of ground beef. I doubled all the ingredients except the meat for my son's baseball party and the dish came home empty. Even the kids like it! I serve it with the scoopable tortilla chips.

I just made this dip and thought it tasted great.  I added a little bit of salsa to the browned ground beef and also added a small package of softened cream cheese to the refried beans. I used black beans instead of the black olives and included diced jalapenos to the top.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I used taco sauce instead of salsa.  Chop small bright red cherry tomatoes for a very pretty finish.  I was more liberal with the thickness of the layers, everyone loved it!

Wow!  Great dip.  I found that 8 ounces of sour cream was definitely not enough to spread across a 9 x 13 pan, so I used an entire 16-ounce container of sour cream.  Also, I used just 1 pound of ground meat and mixed it with a can of drained pinto beans.  On top, along with the chopped olives, I put chopped canned stewed tomatoes and a small can of diced green chilies (I didn't have fresh tomatoes or green onions on hand).  I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese, since it packs more flavor than Monterey Jack cheese.  Great with Fritos corn chips and plain tortilla chips!

There are so many recipes for 7 layer dip here, I was really torn. But I am SO GLAD I chose this one. It is really delicious. We used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I was nervous about not seasoning it at all, but you know what? It didn't need it. The salsa and guacamole both had a kick so that the meat needed to be mild. I think the middle layer of cheese is especially important, as most dips just have cheese on top and it always falls off the chip. Be sure to smush down each layer as you add them, and don't be shy on amounts, we used more like 1.5-2 cups of guac, sour cream and more like 1.5 cans of refried beans. No need to really measure since you're just layering it. This is a great recipe.

This was so good.  The only change I made was adding a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef- it seemed too plain without it.  Otherwise, this was totally awesome.

I made this for an office pot luck and everyone ranted and raved over it.  They scraped the dish clean and I had to email the recipe to many co-workers.  I did make my own guacamole using 5 avacados and a dash of lemon juice.  I also left out the salsa.  I think the secret is to use taco seasoning and mix with the sour cream.  I heated the refried beans and added a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce.  Excellent and I will make again.

Thanks for the recipe.  Everyone loves it. Aloha 2 u.  I also think it should be in a cool are because the salsa is a bit runny.

YUMMMMMY....I made this recipe for a fight party and it was gone wayyyy before the fight began. I seasoned my ground beef with Nature's Seasoning, Lawry's seasoned salt and garlic powder. Since I did this I only needed to add about 1 tablespoon of taco seasoning to the beef and 1 tablespoon to the sour cream. I left the guacomole out and it was still delicious. I was asked for the recipe about 5 times....definitely a keeper. Thanks Dee Dee

Oh wow...this beats my previous 7 layer dip hands down!  The hallmark of a GREAT recipe is one that allows you to make minor variations to suit your taste and still comes out delicious!  Since all of the items I bought seemed to come is just a bit larger size than needed...I simply adjusted the recipe up a bit, and put most of it in a 9x13 pyrex baking dish to take to a party (where it was a hit!) and the rest of it in a 9" deep dish pie plate to eat the next day at home.  It is definitely better at room temperature and easier to scoop out with those neat Tostitos "scoop" tortilla chips.  I loved it!  Thanks Dee Dee for sharing!

This was good. I added taco seasoning to the meat when I cooked it and then mixed some taco seasoning in with the sour cream. I mixed some of the salsa with the beans and some with the guacamole. I didn't follow the order given though as we have our own way by starting with beans, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, and then the rest. I didn't have green onion so I used dried chives and no tomato so I put salsa on top instead. We turned this into a meal instead of just a "dip". I've never put meat in before and I didn't much care for the cold meat, but my family loved it.

I served this at a potluck and it was a favorite. I did omit the beef as I didn't think it was wise to leave it out buffet style with it. Also I made my own guacamole which is extremely simple (2 avacados, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2 crushed cloves garlic, 1 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp chili powder, salt and pepper to taste. Mash all together. Add some chopped peppers for extra flavor. So good!)

This is great. I used the ChefNan idea of soft cream cheese with the refried beans for a more solid base and used a packet of taco seasoning in the ground beef. This is a do over for sure.

To spice it up a bit:
*add taco seasoning to the ground meat
*thin out refired beans with water and season with 1/4 cup onion and 2 strips of bacon
*Use fresh pico de gallo in place of salsa and up the amount to 2 cups
*use 16 oz of sour cream
*make a hearty guacamole with 5 ripe avacados, juice of 2 limes, salt and a few chopped tomatoes, dont puree the avacado just mash it
*I like to layer it this way too: 1seasoned meat,2refried beans mixture, 3fresh pico de gallo, 4guacamole, 5sour cream, 6cheese, 7black olives and green onion.
Serve with hearty tortilla chips!

This was a huge hit when I brought this as an appetizer to a party.  I only used about half the amount of ground beef and prepared the dip in an 8x8 pan.  I also heated the dip for a few minutes in the oven because I thought the cheese would be better melted.  I served the dip with Fritos Scoops.  Everyone enjoyed it!

If you dont like to add the meat it is really good without it, just add some taco seasoning to your sour cream and it adds a really zesty taste!!! This is my favorite way to make it.

This recipe sounded so promising but just didn't deliver!  The cold beef was not enjoyable.  And I also found it VERY bland, even after adding extra chili powder, salt and pepper to the meat.  Brought it to a get-together and brought most of it back home.  We did put some in the microwave for a few seconds and that seemed to "wake up the flavour" a bit.  But overall, not a winner.  I'll be deleting this one from my recipe box.

WOW! Terrific quick and easy recipe. The kids and dults loved it. This will be a regular around our house. As others suggested, I added taco seasoning to the beef (no water) and I also added chopped jalapenos in the layers. I served it later that evening rolled up in a soft tortilla...Awesome!

This was so easy to make and everyone raved about how good it was. I made it the night before and warmed in the oven before serving.   I added taco seasoning to ground beef. I also mixed sour cream with cream cheese and added a little more taco seasoning.

I have made this recipe numerous times. Seven layer dip is way better with ground beef. I leave out the beans altogether and sub a can of sliced jalapenos for the olives. Every time I make this dip it is completely gone in minutes and everyone says it is better with beef.

As is, this recipe was not that great but it is a great base for a great recipe! The way I now make this dip is as follows:
I make the beef as if I were making regular tacos, I "drain" some of the salsa "juice" into the sour cream and mix it together so it's not just tartness. I throw it under the broiler for 5minutes, then I top it with lettuce, tomatoes, and olives and leave out the green onions since I hate them. I used Kraft shredded mexican cheese blend, and old el paso fat free spicy refried beans. I like a bit of spice and this way was a good balance of spicy without overpoweringly hot. Do like Taco Bell - Let Sour Cream sit out for a few minutes to soften (Not room temp just 5 minutes or so) then put it in a pastry/zip bag and squeeze it out for easy spreading!

Great dip for parties or get togethers.  The only thing I changed was I added taco seasoning when cooking the meat...it gave it a little zip!  You can also use ground turkey and reduced fat refried beans for a lighter dish.

I thought it was very bland. The refried beans needs shakes of hot sauce added and taco sauce...  also very difficult to spread the cream cheese on ground beef!!!!!! wow!!! need to spread the cream cheese mixed with the guacamole first then sprinkle the ground beef!!!  also needs some garlic powder mixed with the cream cheese..... 1 star for this dip. wonder if people have never made taco dip before...... made it for a birthday party and no rave reviews on this one................ oh well. i am sure that i am not the only one who thought this recipe needed help.

Delicious...at least that's what they told me on Sunday.  I replaced the guacamole with lettuce (putting it 2nd to top) and used a 15 oz. can of chili with beans (to save time).

Very good!  We aren't big guacamole fans, so next time I'll leave that out (per a request from the hubby).  I fixed it as the "main dish" for supper and it was a nice for a change of pace on a hot summer evening when I didn't feel like cooking.

Great, easy recipe. Didn't add guacamole b/c not many people care for it. But it was yummy, and even better heated up the next day! I'm using the leftovers for taco salad.

loved the recipe however I added a diced onion and 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the ground beef with a sachet of taco seasoning and it was delicious. also I heated the dip in the oven till the cheese was bubbling and served it with a bread stick cut into slices as well as corn chips.

I have 4 teenagers in my house, so I took this recipe from an apetizer to meal by adding a little more refried beans and ground beef.  A couple of bags of tortilla chips and a tossed salad to go along with it and it was a hit.  This is definitely my kids favorite weekend meal.

Great to bring to a Mexican potluck -- but a bit expensive.  Including the price of the disposable aluminum pan and two bags of chips (Fritos Scoops and tortilla), it cost $30, but I used some premium ingredients and I'm sure I could have cut that price in half.  I was in a super big hurry so I bought Marie's Guacamole and used canned diced tomatoes.  I used chopped black olives like the recipe called for but next time I'll use sliced too, it would have been prettier.  Also, the Marie's was this very unnatural mint green color - kind of scary.  Definitely fresh guac next time.  The sour cream WAS hard to spread evenly, I may try using a piping bag in the future.  As per the other reviews, I used a bag of taco seasoning added to the ground beef while it was browning - great idea!  I also heated the refried beans to make them "less solid" and easier to spread.  Everyone commented on the dip and it went pretty quickly.  Thanks Dee Dee!

It was very easy to prepare and looked awesome, but I didn't care for beef very much at room temperature. However, my guests seemed to like it as most of it was gone at the end of the night. What was left, I heated up in the microwave and loved it! Next time, I will either serve it warm or leave the beef off, but it is definitely staying in my recipe box.

Yes it is mild but then again you can kick it up a notch easily for personal taste. This was a hit for my company as not every one is a fan of anything overly spicy. I used a lot more guacamole cause we really like it, used more sour cream, salsa and more olives also. This was hit for our Christmas Party.

I added homemade taco seasoning and a small can of V-8 instead of water to the ground beef to give it some flavor. I also folded in one small can of mild green chilies to the refried beans. The boys loved it, GREAT for Superbowl Sunday.

Made this for my boyfriend's bday party and EVERYONE LOVED IT!!! Changes I made: Added one medium onion, drained about 80% of the grease for the ground beef (wanted some fat in there because many reviews said the dip was too thick), added one packet of taco seasoning, with water, to ground beef, added one can of mexican corn to ground beef. I RARELY make changes to recipes but along with other reviews and how this turned out, I'd say it was necessary. 
Also, I used medium salsa and I don't think it was enough of a kick so in the future I will use hot salsa and mabe spicy guac. 
Thanks for a wonderful reipe!

Great recipe!  It's a crowd favorite!

I had to modify it a little to appease my picky eaters.  Instead of salsa, I used enchilada sauce.  I also added salt, garlic and onion to the ground beef to intensify the flavor.

Also, before topping it with the tomatoes, green onions and olives, I toss it under the broiler for a couple minutes to melt the cheese.

My husband always requests that I make this for when he has buddies over.  I do make a few changes.  I make my own guac.  I also add half a packet of taco mix to the sour cream. On top, I omit the olives and add sprinkle cilantro.  Its always a hit!!

I have made this dish several times, sometimes with ground turkey, ground beef or no meat at all.  Either way it is always a hit.  I do add some taco seasoning to my meat when browning it so it has a little more flavor.  I add the taco seasoning to the vegetarian refried beans if I am making this with no meat.

I made this for our July 4 cookout and it was a hit.  I did make a few changes.  I added taco seasoning to the beef, left out the guacamole and olives and added shredded lettuce.  This makes a huge dish, but the leftovers were great - we just made a huge taco salad.  This is a great recipe that you can change to accomodate anyone's taste.

Yummy! This was tasty and oh so easy to prepare. I made this for SuperBowl and I was able to just put it together before I had to cook my other foods and it worked out great. I agree, this is best served at room temp. I prepared it about 2 hours before guests arrived, and when they did, it was just right. It was almost completely gone and got lots of compliments. Thank you for sharing!

I made this for the Seahawk vs. Packers game on Saturday, Jan 12th. We had a few people over and it was a huge hit. There was a little leftover after the game, which I placed in a bowl in the fridge. The next day I didn't want to eat it cold so I microwaved a little on top of my chips for less then a minute to warm it slightly. It was delicious! I will make this again for Super Bowl XLII!

Very good.  I sauteed (1 lb was plenty!) the beef with some garlic salt, cumin and chili powder for more flavor and eliminated the salsa.  Use fresh chopped tomatoes in place of salsa and add more on top for garnish - so much better.  Serve with blue chips -always a hit.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I mix the sourcream with a packet of taco seasoning mix for more flavor.

I recently brought this dip to a cookout and it was a big hit! I did not add the ground beef since some people were vegetarians...it was just as good without! Also, I mixed one package of taco seasoning into the sour cream layer for added flavor. VERY YUMMY!

I prepared this dish for a friendly get together.  I added taco seasoning to the ground beef and used a hot salsa.  Everyone said it was delicious and asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

My family loved this at Christmas as an appetizer! I made it the night before and pulled it out when everyone was getting hungry before Christmas dinner was done. Room temperature has a better flavor, I agree. Everyone loved it! They raved over it! I forgot the salsa, but it was still wonderful! Thank you!

Very easy to make, the second time I made this dish, I didn't put as much ground beef, and did add a little more sour cream and salsa.. I agree this dish is best at room temperature. This is something easy to make and feeds plenty.

Cost me about $25.00 to make and that was using generic brands...I added taco mix to the meat and it really helped the flavor.  The cheese was an overkill and you could easily make this with 2 cups of cheese total.  Great tasting recipe

This was a huge disappointment for all of us. The cold meat was not enjoyable, and the proportions of everything else were off: way too much cheese, not enough guacamole and green onions. Next time I'll omit the beef entirely, and use less cheese and more veggies, and not heat anything. Oh well, at least the Giants won!

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years and always get requests for the recipe.  We do it a little bit differently by omitting the meat which makes the preparation much faster and easier.  We layer the refried beans on the bottom and then sprinkle taco seasoning and mix it in!  This gives it a great taste and adds spice. Omit the salsa and place chopped fresh tomatoes on top and cover with the cheese.  Its a little difficult to make the layers look nice but once you cover it in cheese you can't tell the difference.  Best served warm!  Enjoy!

Great dip! I took out the refried beans, though, because I don't care for them. Also omitted the olives, and substituted for green pepper instead. It lasted a few day, I made so much!

It would have given 5-stars if it would have been spicier.  The changes I made to the recipe after a couple of tries -- I used taco season on the meat, and did not mix the seasoning with water.  I chopped about a 1 loose cup of cilantro and add that to the meat layer.  I used refried beans with chilis.  I would recommend pepper jack cheese as part of the cheese blend.  I doubled the guacamole amount.  I used olives stuffed with jalapenos.  I know this sounds like a lot of changes.  The original recipe is good but I wanted to spice it up a bit.

This would delicious!  I agree with some other reviewers that it could use some heat (and I don't even like spicy things), because all of the savory flavors can be overwhelming to the palate.  But overall it was a winner.  My guests even took the last little remnants home with them.  Thanks!

This is great, the only things I do different is I don't use ground beef and instead add taco seasoning to the guacamole and sour cream mix!! Tastes that much better!! MMMMM

This is a great recipe, I do something a little different that I think makes a big difference. For starters I don't typically put beef in it but that's just a personal pref. I think adding a pkg of taco seasoning to the beans is key!! Then spread that on the bottom and layer with the other toppings, I usually have a thin layer of finely chopped lettuce and have even put a can of chopped green chilies for a different flavor. But love it!!! I make it for work all the time.

My family loves it.  The best thing is it is so easy.  My sister in law said to add a can of chili too.  It was pretty good that way too.  Just depends on the flavor you want. We use this with our kids as main dish some days.  They devour it!

It was pretty much gone at the end of the night. I made a couple of minor changes to the recipe. I used ground beef AND pork sausage as the meats, and put in a layer of nacho cheese.

I made this for New Year's Eve and it was a big hit!  I made a few changes to the original recipe: I added a packet of taco seasoning to the hamburger as I browned it. I nixed the salsa, although I think I will add that the next time. I also recommend using homemade guac or doctor up the store brand - I used spicy Wholly Guacamole, but I think the store-bought guac was lacking something, so I'll be making it homemade next time.  I layered everything into a trifle dish and it looked really pretty - beans first, ending with the sour cream layer on top, garnished with the cheese and olives.  Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe - it's extremely versatile and I will definitely be making it again! :)

This is a great recipe! I normally make taco dips for parties but have never used ground beef in one before. It makes such the difference! The only thing I did differently is I cooked the beef with taco seasoning. I agree with other reviewers that it is best at room temperature. Also, I had left overs the next day and put some in a taco shell and heated it up in the microwave and it was great. Perfect instant tacos! Can't wait to make again for the next party!

This is really amazing. I made this for my bridal shower a few weeks ago and I got rave reviews. People couldnt get enough. Luckily I made lots and lots of it. I made home made guacamole and used vegetarian refried beans. After sprinkling the cheese on top I put it in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese.

The dip is a little "dry" for lack of a better word. Needed more than 8 oz sour cream, half the amount of cheese (eliminate bottom layer), and perhaps more salsa. Also the chopped black olives don't look as nice as the sliced.

This was great! I used taco sauce instead of salsa and followed the tip to melt the cheese on the meat a little. I also didn't use any olives. Guests loved it. One note though, is that it is best served freshly made before the event.

This is really good, however, I added Taco seasoning to the meat.  It needed a little more heat, so the second try I used spicy guacamole and medium salsa.  I also put bell peppers on top with the tomatoes.

Great dip!  I used packaged taco seasoning when browning the meat.  I also used a standard 9 x 13 baking dish that has its own basket for serving.  Best served at room temp; when it's cold there's just no scooping it without destroying the tortilla chips.  Be sure to have several spoons at hand so guests can scoop the dip onto their desired chip!

I made this dip for a party we went to and it didn't go at first, but once a couple of people tried it, it was gone in no time.  My husband thought there was too much meat, so I will cut back on the meat a little bit next time.  I also added fajita seasoning to the meat as I was cooking it to give it a little more flavor.

I made this for a Super Bowl party and it was devoured!  Everyone liked it!  I added a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef and added approx 1/3 - 1/2 cup of water to it (less then the seasoning packet recommended).  I also fogot the sour cream layer, so I topped the dip with a dollop in each corner and one in the middle.  Make sure you serve this with thick tortilla chips...I served it with chips that are scoop shaped and they worked perfectly.

Fantastic, it was a perfect birthday party dish.  But, it was hard to spread the sour creme over the ground beef.  The next time I made it (about two hours later) I layered beans, sour creme, salsa, cheese, then sprinkled all the toppings on top.  I also substituted green peppers for green onions.  (As a fun b-day twist, I used the sliced olives to write "happy birthday" on the top of the dip.)

This is the best seven layer dip. I placed nachos on the bottom and placed the seven layer dip on top, and served it as a nacho supreme. Perfect for  a meal itself or a snack.

I mixed a softened package of cream cheese in the refried beans to give the bottom a sturdy base to better hold the other ingredients.  Also substituted veggie crumbles for ground beef with the taco seasoning others recommended for a lighter version.

Made this many times with my own slight variations. When I'm browning the beef I usually sprinkle about a 1/2T of cumin into it, which adds a lot of flavor. I also use fresh homemade salsa out of diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro, green onions and chopped fresh jalapenos. But when you're crunched for time, the jarred salsa works just as well.

Very good.   I added an envelope of taco seasoning to the browned hamburger.  Just gave the recipe a little extra flavor.  Also used a 16-oz. jar of salsa (instead of 1 cup).

Delicious! I took some of the advice and used low sodium taco seasoning in the beef. I also heated the dip at 350 until the cheese melted. There was none left! So easy to make and so good! My only pseudo problem was the sour cream is hard to spread over the beef. I think I'll use more than a cup next time. Thanks so much for sharing! I'm making it again this weekend.

This was wonderful!!!  I made it for a New Year's Eve party and it was GONE by the time the night was over!  I used less than 1 pound ground beef, 16 oz of sour cream, Dean's brand guacamole dip, 1 cup fresh chopped tomatoes, enough green onions to make a whole layer.  I used 3/4 pkg taco seasoning with 1/4 cup water in the ground beef; the the rest of the taco seasoning I mixed with the sour cream.  I heated it just enough to make it a little warmer than room temp and begin to melt the cheese.  It was great with fritos and corn chips!!  My dish is a bit smaller than 9x13.

I didn't use the ground meat in mine because I wanted to keep the dip light. The other 7 Layers were excellent though!

I agree with others who suggested needing some spice. Instead of bland canned refried beans, try making your own, and use black beans (though pintos okay too). Cook drained beans over low heat with a little bacon drippings, garlic and salt; mash the beans as they cook.  Much better than the canned stuff. Also, try layers of beans, beef (with taco or similar seasonings, but you can omit altogether), then some of the cheese and melt slightly in the oven. Cool, then salsa, guacamole (avocado, chopped with lime juice), then sour cream (try mixing with half ranch dip or green chili dip) for the top, sprinkle a little more cheese, tomatoes, green onions and olives (and a few chopped jalapenos if you like).  More colorful presentation that way. Yum!!

I have made this recipe quite a few times for parties and family gatherings, and it is a hit!  However, I'm a vegetarian, so I substitute a bag of frozen soy meat for the ground beef, and no one even notices!  I will make this time and again.

Made for superbowl and it was huge hit...  I agree, best served at room temperature.  I went heavy on the green onions and gaucamole.

my friends beg me to bring this every week to our football parties.  I always add a packet of taco seasoning to the meat, and try to let it set up in the fridge for an hour or so before serving.  I also leave the guacamole out to please the masses.

i made this recipes without the meat for a holiday party, and it was a big hit.  i thought it could have used a little something else, but i'm not exactly sure what.  possibly hot sauce?  i think drizzling a little hot sauce over the top might have made it even better!

Whoever originally invented 7-layer dip was a genius yet it's so easy that you don't need to be a genius to make it come out good!  This recipe is great.  If you're taking this to a party, don't expect to bring home leftovers because there will be none left!

This is a really wonderful dip.  I took the advice of previous "reviewers" and added a package of taco seasoning to the ground beef and another package to the sour cream. This was a big hit with my family.  Spreading the sour cream and the guacamole is a bit of a pain though. As others have suggested, I would recommend doubling the sour cream and guacamole so that you have more to spread and stirring the sour cream up a little bit to make it a little more fluid.

I added 1 pouch of Taco Seasonings to ground beef, and anothe pouch to the sour cream.  Instead of the guacamole, I chopped 2 avacados with 1 teaspoon lime juice.  
The firt time I did the recipe, it was too bland.

My guest loved it.  I live in Sweden where Mexican food is not to common.  This was a huge hit.  It may not be true Mexican food, but, It works well.  I did however change the salsa for jalapenos and instead of regular sour cream I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo mixed with a package of taco sauce mix.  I know it sounds strange, but, trust me it was awesome.  I will be making this more often since I aready have request for it.

This recipe turned out great. I made it for a going away party for my boss. I tweaked just a tad because I was lazy and didn't have time to defrost chopped meat plus I could find black olives in the store. Nevertheless my co-workers LOVED it! everyone went back for second and thirds. I will definitely make it again. In fact knowing my co-workers; it will be requested.  So here's what I changed: instead of using hamburger meat I used black beans. I used that as my first layer. I drained the tomatoes as everyone's suggested before adding them to the dish. Also, my fourth 5 th layer I used canned corn. I kept the sour cream and guacamole separate to add more color and layers. I sprinkled the taco seasoning and some Adabo every third layer. No one noticed that there was no beef.  They don't even mind. I feel the thickness of the beans helped with that. 

Two thumbs up!

This is a pretty good recipe. I prefer it heated so the cheese is melted and gives a better taste for my preference, but nonetheless, it's good. I also made my own guacamole (by Bob Cody on allrecipes.com) and my own pico de gallo (by grneyedmustang on allrecipes.com) to give a little more flavor. Worth the little bit of work to put my own work into this.

Every time I've made this I've got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I like Trader  Joe's organic blue corn chips and salsa authentica. I add cilantro,  red onion and tomato to the salsa. Extra quacamole and sour cream.  Then I serve it at room temperature  because I think the ground beef tastes better warm than refrigerator  cold. Thank you for this great recipe!!!

I've used this recipe before and added more spices to the meat for extra flavor. Try adding 1 tbs red chili powder, 1 diced garlic clove,  1/2 yellow onion diced, and 1 tsp. Adobo seasoning. I usually re-fry the beans in a skillet because it makes them easier to spread. If you are feeling really adventurous make a fresh pot of "dirty beans" the day before and re-fry them to use in this recipe.

Really good recipe. The Hubbs mentioned a layered taco dip he'd make when entertaining (especially in college), and I'd only used the recipe that uses cream cheese and gets baked in the oven before topping with the "cold stuff". I was glad to find this, and The Hubbs said it seemed pretty much to have the same ingredients as he remembered using in the past. Minor changes made: used a packet of Taco Seasoning when browning the ground beef. I also found sliced black olives that had diced ripe (red) jalapenos in them (by a company called Lindsay). I'd picked them up accidentally, but they worked out great with this recipe. I used a multi-cheddar blend as well (I think it contained 4 different types of Cheddar Cheese). No other changes except to use shredded lettuce on top rather than green onion. Delicious.

I've become rather famous among my partner's friends for this dip! It's a meal in itself and the only modifications I've made were the suggestions of adding taco seasoning to the beef and sour cream.

Was a hit for the superbowl.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and I added some taco seasonings to the meat for flavor, as this recipe called for no seasoning.  I also used light sour cream.

Great recipe! Beware that it's a lot of ingredients for a pan that's only 1.5 inches deep. It fits, but barely. You can reduce the amount of cheese, or just use a slightly deeper pan.

Wow this was so good! Great for the Super Bowl. I loved everything about it and followed the recipe except I added red onions to my guacamole. We had so much left over by the end of the night that we ate it for dinner the next day. We just added it to a flour tortilla and ate it like a burrito.

Delicious!  I made a couple of changes to suit our taste--omitted the olives and guacamole, and used refried beans with green chiles, added taco seasoning to the meat, and used a mexican cheese blend for half the cheese.  Still could have used a little bit more heat; I think I'll use more taco seasoning next time. But it was a big hit regardless!

This recipe is great as is! However, I did make a few changes to accommodate special circumstances. First, I made it vegetarian by not using beef. Second, I replaced the sour cream with whipped cream cheese (I would heat it in the microwave for about 30 seconds before trying to spread it), and third I added some diced jalapeños on top with the onions, tomatoes, and olives. I would also suggest using a good salsa (not just some Tostitos brand stuff). It was a real hit at the party, and everyone loved it!

I made this recipe as directed, but added 2 tbsp taco seasoning to the sour cream.  Still a bit bland for my taste, but it went over very well at Lambeau Field.  Will make again, but with some modifications as suggested by other reviewers

I took this to a football party and everyone raved about it. I added a little taco seasoning to the sour cream and I would use sliced ripe olives next time instead of chopped. They weren't appetizing looking and didn't taste that good. In fact my hubby said just forget them at all next time!!

It was a bit funny because I made it for a bunch of french people... it just sat and sat on the table and no one touched it. I started thinking something was terribly wrong and it would be the only thing left over... then I realized they did not understand it was a dip to go with chips... Once I explained everyone dug in ;-) One person even asked for the recipe...

i have tried this recipe several ways, but here are 2 of my favorite variations:  use fahita chicken instead of beef and beans.  also, you can cook the dip and it melds together and tastes great.  try cooking 20 min at 350

Very good, I would use about 1/2 the amount of cream chz and sour cream mix, I used it all the first time I made it and that was really all you could taste, there was too much, I cut it in half and it was perfect.

I like this recipe.  I make the layer dip quite often when it comes to potluck type things.  I have never done one with beef though...it was good.  People seemed to like it since there was no leftovers.  Thanks for the post.

Good recipe but the dip started looking really wet and sloppy about halfway through the party. Don't know how you could fix that but it's kind of unappetizing.

This was excellent!  I agree too like others that it should be room temperature or the chips will break when trying to dip some out. Excellent to take to a tailgating party because it can sit out.

This is a fantastic recipe! The only change i made was in seasoning the ground beef. I added a little chili powder and some cayenne pepper. I also added a some garlic powder to the guacamole and it gave off and amazing flavor! Definently a crowd pleaser, and very tasty when made w/o the beef too!

Stir in 1 pkg of a Taco Seasoning packet to the refried beans then spread in a 13x9" pan.  Really adds good flavor.

This recipe is great! To make it healthier, I used ground turkey meat, fat free sour cream, 2% shredded cheese (Kraft makes a Mexican blend that's awesome!), and fat free refried beans. You can't tell the difference, and you won't feel as guilty!!

This was good, but it seemed to be missing something.  Maybe the salsa wasn't hot enough?  If I make this again, I'll add taco seasoning to the meat when cooking it.

I added some salsa to the chili beans and cooked them together so the bottom of the bowl was hot and the rest was cold.  It was fantastic!  Thank you for this recipe!

This layer dip was great! I got complement after complement. I made my own guacamole and refried beans. 3 avocados, 1/2 lime juice, chopped celantro to taste and salt to taste. I also seasoned my ground beef with tsp. garlic salt, chili powder, and about a table spoon of dried oregano. I used medium pace picante salsa. I will absolutely make this again!

I made this for my boyfriend and his buddies for their poker game today and it was gobbled up in record time. I thought it was pretty good, but I do think I like the version with cream cheese and taco seasoning just a little bit more. This is great though. I did add a can of diced green chilis and omitted the green onions. Tostitos Scoops work great with this dip.

This was good the first time around, but couldn't stomach the leftovers.  I don't like to eat cold meat.  If you don't mind that, this is a good recipe for you.  I will stick to another 7 layer dip recipe that I use.

Very good recipe except I boiled and fried my own pinto beans, mashed up mashed up fresh avacados and just added a little salt for the guacamole and I added some taco seasoning to the meat.  Very good recipe, I took it to a party and there was nothing left.

This is delicious and soooo easy to make. Make sure you use taco seasoning in the meat, it gives it so much more flavor.  I've already had requests, so I'll be making a double batch for Christmas Eve.

Very easy and very good!  I made it minus the beef to please some vegetarians and it was still incredibly tasty!

Absolutely delicious!  I made it for our New Year's party and everyone loved it!  I added taco seasoning to the ground beef like everyone suggested. Will be making it again in.

I've heard so much about this dip, and decidedly on a last minute to try it out for out NYEve's Party. I was skeptical at first.. but it was a HIT!!! Everyone loves it... I made it without the ground beef (for my vegetarian friends)... will try it with the beef next time! Thank you for this easy and tasty recipe!!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I did not use the ground beef (for the "veggie" folks) and I made my own guacamole (2 avacados, 1 chopped plum tomato, salt, pepper, cilantro, garlic powder to taste, and the juice of 1 lemon. Zip it thru your food processor, still leaving it a little chunky if you prefer, and you've got a quick dip that's so delicious).  I put my dip in the oven just until the cheese started to melt a bit, but even the cold leftovers were good.  Everyone loved it!

This was outstanding.  I followed some earlier suggestions: I cooked the ground beef with a taco powder and I also mixed the sour cream with the taco powder.  I put it into two 8x8 pans.  It got me rave reviews at a recent tailgating party!

I made my own guacamole by using 3 small avacados, 1/3 tsp salt, 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper and a couple dashes of cumin. I went a little lighter on the cheese and left out the olives. Other than that, I kept everything the same, and we ate it spooned into tortillas.

This was one of the best dips I've ever made!!  I took it to my office party and it was a HIT!!!  I layered mexican cheeses three times and in addition to the other toppings, I added fresh cilantro!!  Not only was it good but it made a beautiful presentation to the table!

This was wonderful- not a bit left over.  I made 2 revisions to this recipe. I added a half of a packet of taco seasoning to the sour cream and I heated it in the oven for about 10 minutes on 350 degrees.  The cheese was melted and the dip was to die for.  I highly recommend heating it.

I split a packet of low sodium taco seasoning between the browned beef and the sour cream.  I also used a lot more than a cup of guacamole and salsa.  This was a hit!

This dish was good, but not a "wow" to me.  It has everything I love in a Mexican dish but there really wasn't a zing to it.  I even added taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I'm not a big beef eater and would of liked more beans and sour cream, and less meat.  Regardless, I took this dish to a potluck and it was gone within the first half hour.  It was mainly the men that gave compliments for it too!

By far the best 7 layer dip out there!  It is much better with homemade quacamole and salsa, just make them ahead of time to make it easier!

This dip is always a big hit.  I have made it with and without the ground beef.  I also added the taco seasoning to the ground beef.  Also, we all love cilantro, so I chop up a half cup or so and sprinkle it on top. It could also be added to the salsa.  Yummy.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was good but a bit bland.  In the future, I will add a tsp of cumin to the beans, taco seasoning mix to the beef and 1 1/2 cups of medium to hot salsa instead of one.  I also might do a full layer of green onions for more texture.

This was far from a hit at a Christmas party I attended.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  The beef was bland, so I suggest taking the pointers from other reviewers on adding taco seasoning to the beef.  Also, the flavors of all the layers didn't mesh well.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

I added a packet of taco seasoning to the beef for a little more flavor and omitted the sour cream all together since I'm not a big fan.  This was just one of many recipes on our appetizer buffet for July 4th.  Thanks for sharing your version Dee Dee.

My friends generally shy away from guacomole, so I used Frito Lay nacho cheese sauce instead and it added a little more flavor.

Pretty good dip. I found it very hard to spread the layers as thinly as I would've liked them for the best presentation and taste. When I have had this before (when others have brought it to parties, etc) it always is layered very thinly and disappears. I had some leftover, but then I served a 9x13 dish-ful to 6 people.

Definately use the biggest dish you have, this is one HUGE dip.  But, every last bite of it goes every single time I make it.  I did skip the gaucamole, though, most people I know don't like it.  I also added extra refried beans ans sour cream.

This was pretty good.  I served it right after making it and nobody in my picky family ate it.  I chilled it overnight after the party and the next day it was awesome!  I highly suggest chilling it overnight.  The tomatoes made it a bit watery, so next time I will use less.  I also think it needed an extra kick.  I think adding taco seasonings to the sour cream is a good idea.  I also doubled the sour cream and guacomole, omitted the beef as my sister is a vegatarian.

This was great. I made it for the guys while they were watching the playoffs and there was not one drop left at the end of the nite. Definetly a meal on its own!! I would recomend adding the taco sause to the meat as well. I used Xtra-lean ground turkey and low fat sour cream to cut down on the calories. Will make again and again.

This was a hit at our New Years Eve party. It is very good and since you serve it at room temperature, it's easy to make up ahead. I'll make it again.

This recipe is very similar to others but was really good.  Everybody loved it!  I axed the ground beef because I didn't have time to cook it and added 1/4 cup of mayonaise to a mixture of sourcream and taco seasoning.  The taco seasoning was HOT flavored and so it was really spicy.  I recommend using a medium flavored seasoning.

If you want to do this quick, it's pretty good with pre-made Guacamole, but naturally it tastes the best with fresh homemade.

I made this at a baby shower and the new mommy (still pregnant) loved it so much that she pulled a spot up next to the dip, grabbed the bowl of chips, and ate the half of the dip that was left.  She was so full afterwards that she got down on to the floor and just laid there laughing.  I couldn't believe how good it went!!!!

We added orange pepper to the chopped tomatoes, onion and olives on top.  Our 8-year-old needed convincing to eat it at first, but quickly got over his fear of some of the ingredients.  Everything tastes wonderful together and we all enjoyed this as a dinner with tortilla chips.

I made this dip for Food Day at work, but I didn't have the can of refried beans, so I used two cans of hot Frito Lay bean dip instead. My co-workers loved it and I am asked to make it every time we have Food Day at work!!! Thanks for the great recipe!    K. Carswell

Very good. I added taco seasoning and a little Pace salsa to the meat to give it some flavor. It needed some fresh jalapeños (or some red pepper kick) which I added to half of the dip. Delicious!

This was gone in seconds with the teenage crowd. I did season the ground beef with taco seasoning. I doubled the sour cream and made homemade guacamole and probably doubled that, as well. I also used seasoned whole black beans. For dipping, I used 2 bags of Doritos tortilla chips (the blue chips and also the white cheddar). Yummy! Will make this again. :)

I do love adding the meat , that makes it more hearty but can leave the meat off and just start with refried beans.   Also I add 1 package of taco seasoning to my spur cream.  it gives it more  Yum!!!

First time making a seven layer dip, and this one was pretty darn tasty! I try to give recipes the benefit of the doubt before making adjustments and then rating them. In this case, I didn't have all the ingredients, so my review includes some small tweaks. I mixed the beef with diced onion, minced garlic, and a can of diced Hatch green chilies. I seasoned the beef the with Taco Seasoning 1 recipe from this website to kick up the spicy factor. I was too impatient to let the beef cool, so I spread it over the first cheese layer to help the two melt together. The most challenging part was getting the sour cream to spread in a nice, even layer. I subbed sliced jalapenos (from a jar) for the olives. For next time, I'll use twice as much salsa to make that layer thicker. I was out of guacamole (sad, I know!), and will make sure to add that layer next time. Definitely a great recipe that you can adjust based on what you have on hand. We ate this at room temperature and cold out of the refrigerator; it tasted great both ways. Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe just replaced my old 7 layer dip recipe that I have made for years. So much easier to make and ever bit as good if not better. I make my own salsa, I used my own instead of store bought.

I layer beans on bottom, drain salsa and pat dry with paper towel then sprinkle a small amount over beans. Add cooked hamburger(seasoned with taco seasoning & chopped onion) on top of beans. I prep the day before so I have it in the fridge. I add the sour cream, salsa, or guac.... whatever you want ! Then sprinkle with cheese &  heat through ! YUM !!! Sprinkle with black olives, green onion & cilantro for presentation :)

Turned out delicious! I added taco seasoning to the ground beef, a 1/2 tbsp. Johnny's Seasoning to two cups mashed avocado (instead of one avocado) for the guacamole layer; and instead of the tomato topping I used my homemade super spicy pico de gallo topping (one of my husbands favorites)! I made an extra large batch, and it vanished!

I don't care for cold or room temperature beef, so we leave that layer out and stir the taco seasoning into the sour cream instead. I also add another small can of refried beans to give it more heft. This is a real crowd pleaser.

First of all...NEVER USE A BOWL FOR A 7 LAYER DIP!  Most of you know why, but the photo of this recipe shows it in a bowl. You want everyone to get an even amount of each layer and when you use a bowl, that just doesn't happen. Use a lasagna or deep glass baking dish. Otherwise this recipe was excellent. I did add an either layer of home made bacon bits.  Yummy!

This was a huge hit! Only changes I made were that I added 1 packet of taco seasoning to the beef (no water) and doubled the sour cream. Will make it again!

Five *'s for ingredients -- 1 * for amounts!  So glad that I read the reviews and followed them.  You definitely need 16 ounces of sour cream NOT 8.  You also need two cups of salsa NOT one.  I added taco seasoning to the meat -- if I hadn't I'm sure it would have been too bland.  I also used two cups of guacamole NOT one.  There is no way one cup would have spread over the entire dish.  I  used a cup of diced tomatoes for the top instead of 1/2 cup.  This was one medium size tomato cut up and I drained the liquid by putting the diced pieces in colander before sprinkling one the top of the dish.  I used 2.5 oz can of SLICED olives instead of diced.  Made it for a neighborhood gathering and I called it "7 Pound Dip" because it was quite heavy to carry.  Was well received but I did have some left which my husband and I are using to make a "taco salad" this evening!

Went over great at a party.  Used retried black beans and skipped the ground beef (there is more than seven layers anyway:). )

This is a great, easy recipe. I left out the guacamole since the majority of my family is not a fan of it and then served heated portions of the dip. I've tried serving this at chilled and room temp before but in my opinion, it was much better after heating it up a bit.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!! I took it to a party and everyone loved it!!! I would suggest seasoning the ground beef though, it gives it way more flavor! Just be careful not to over season! There are so many amazing flavors in this dish that you don't want to overpower. I made mine in a trifle dish and the presentation was nice but it was kinda hard to serve. Next time I think I'll make it in a casserole dish or a shallow bowl. Can't wait to make it again! BEST SEVEN LAYER DIP EVER!!!!!

This was a HUGE hit at the party we had. Someone brought store-bought 7-layer dip, but mine was gone and no one touched the store-bought! 

Changes I made (which made it 4 stars, not 5): I added home made guacamole (Guacamole by Bob Cody) and I added a packet of taco seasoning to the beans. I also put in a LOT of cheddar cheese.

Great recipe, with lots of room to customize! To amp up the flavor, I added a packet of spicy taco seasoning to the beef (you could use regular or mild as well). I also put the cheese on as the last layer and popped it under the broiler for a few minutes to melt. Delicious, and now everyone asks me to bring this to parties!

This was totally up my familys alley.
I didn't do a whole lot different. I wanted to season the ground beef so I added Montreal Steak Seasoning and fresh cilantro to it while it cooked... Also my family dislikes guacamole so we used pickled nacho jalapenos in it's place.

yes i have made this before, tried it at room temp, chips broke, 2nd time added the taco seasoning, on the beef and some in the beans, liked it most when hot, ran out of chips, and reheated it and put in taco shells, with some shreaded lettuce, and fresh diced tomato,some put the hot mixture in a small blue corn and flaxseed fajiti wraps, some put it in a med sized whole wheat tortilla's, to each its own, its all good, chopped fresh avocado also was good in the wraps, it's a 4-5 star which ever way you choose to use it, yummy! thanx for the recipe

Everyone loved this recipe! I made it for a friend's son's first birthday party & it was gone before I knew it. Only thing I did differently was I seasoned the ground beef with taco seasoning & I also mixed a packet of taco seasoning with the sour cream for more spice. Will definitely be making this again!!

Wow, AMAZING!!! This was a HUGE hit at a recent barbecue. I am not a big fan of this type of food, but I thoroughly enjoyed this! Having had it both ways, I agree that it is better at room temperature (and it's easier to scoop when it's not cold). The guacamole added such a fresh taste to this dish. I will definitely make this again, this recipe is a keeper.

This dip was amazing!  I decided to make a "lighter" version by using ground turkey and added taco seasoning for some extra flavor.  The instead of making guac I bought a guac falvoring packet and added the avacods- it made it much easier.  Other than those two changes I did everything else exactly as stated using lighter verisons of all ingredients.  I will definitely be making this again!

I loved this! I have made 7 layer dip many times before, but always without the meat. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a pack of taco seasoning to the beef, I will certainly make this again as everyone loved it at the Super Bowl party ... thanks for the recipe!

Loved the dip! I ended up using two deep dish pie pans instead of one big oblong pan. Turned out it was a great idea as I didn't need all of it. I sent the other pan home with my daughter. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made different versions of this dip in the past and this one is EXCELLENT!  It's a great dip but since it has the ground beef in this recipe it's more like a meal.  You could definitely make it as a meal.  It makes a lot too!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I made it for a party and everyone loved it!! =)

Classic recipe! Before you know it, you've eaten the whole thing. Change it, don't change it--its indestructible. And yummy.

This was really good! I added some spices to the ground beef and made homemade guacamole, it was gone before I could even have a second dip! It was so easy to make as well, my little sister and I made it together so it made for a fun little activity as well ;)

This is perfect just like it is. No changes necessary.  My sister in law introduced me to this and I've made it for family get togethers ever since. It's always a big hit and there are never leftovers.

I have made this twice (once for a mens poker game and once for a family reunion picnic) and both times it has gone over really well.  I have to use more guacamole and sour cream to be able to make the full layer but other than that great recipe :)

I would give this a 10 if I could!! Truly a great addition to any recipe book!  This was all gone in one sitting at a party- turned around and it was gone. I have been asked by several people for the recipe to since then!  I decided to make my own guacamole for this-and I'm so glad I did! it was so good by itself and it definetly added to the dips flavor- I found that recipe on here too. One other thing I did was a use a fresh salsa that I found in the store. It's made with chopped vegatable and is not in a thick sauce like some name brands. I found it in the cooler section with the vegatables. This was also a great addidtion and I know I'll make to the same way from now on too. I recommend this to everyone who want a great mexican dip. Now everyone wants me to make it for parties!

I'm giving this a four because I actually didn't try it,I made it today to take to a family friend but my mother gave it a taste and said it was good. I cooked the meat as suggested but I spiced it with Salt and pepper and garlic powder,bam! you have to use garlic on almost everything in my opion. hehe, I like the idea of someone's suggestion to use taco seasoning,hm,good idea. I also didn't use black olives but I don't like them so I didn't put them on my shopping list.

Very good. Always well received. Added taco seasoning to the meat as suggested by other reviewers. I omit the olives and guacamole (just not a fan). It was mistakenly put it in the oven once and turned out to be a great hot dip as well.

This was *amazing*  I had it for my baby shower and it was a big hit.  Some changes we made - after spreading the beans & cheese, microwave for like 30 seconds to just melt the cheese a little bit.  I know that the beef is supposed to do that, but I think this helps cook the beans a little.  Also, we skipped the black olives, tomatoes & green onions on top.  I agree that it's best at room temp, but it's still good out of the fridge.

This recipe is so amazing.  I made it when my boyfriend had some friends over and they loved it.  But, I did add taco seasoning to the meat and i did not put in the guacamoli (how ever you spell it), I hate that stuff.  But, anyways this dip is so good i think im going to bring the rest of it to work tomorrow.

This was excellent.  I did add 1\2 pack of taco seasoning to the hamburger.  I will make it over and over.  It makes enough for a croud, I took the leftovers to work and they devoured it before lunch.  We loved it.

I have had seven layer dips before but never made it. This is so easy to make. Since we were already eating hamburgers I substituted the meat with Owen Sausage. What a hit it was! My boyfriends couldn't get enough of it. On top that he piled it on his hamburger...what a great tasting dip!

I have made this recipe several times and noticed that it really changes by the brand names of the ingredients purchased.  The refried beans (some are more dippable than others), the chedder cheese blend (some cheeses get chunked together after refrigeration), the guacamole (personal taste, don't care for spicy guacamole), and the salsa (the hot one in the produce isle works better the jar salsa).  But all and all this is one of the best recipes in my collection!!!

I can't believe I'm typing this but I think this recipe has too many layers of cheese.  It was the overpowering taste - and we love cheese.  I would definitely make this again with cheese just on the top.  I also like mixing taco seasoning with the sour cream.  Also I will try homemade salsa and skip the extra tomatoes.  Not bad at all, just needs alterations for our taste.  I used a pyrex deep pie dish for this dip and it looked nice for guests.

I made this recipe for a Christmas Party and it turned out great.  I took the advice from some of the other reviewers and put the dip in the oven to melt the cheese and warm up the beans.  I also added a can of sliced, pickled jalapeno peppers, which were excellent in it.

This is great...although I modified it a bit.  (I don't like black olives or green onions.)  But it's tasty and filling.  I've made this 3 times in the last month already!

Very easy to put together and everyone really liked it. I used taco seasoning in the meat and some already prepared guacamole.

I made this recipe for a family birthday party - What a hit!!!  I should have made 2 of them.  I added taco seasoning to the meat to give it a little extra zing.  It was wonderful - you will not be let down.

Not a bad dip at all!  A little messy in the pan once people start diggin in, but by the end of the night, completly empty tray!  Skipped the guacamole and added the cheese dip above the salsa.  Hard to spread sour cream on beef.  Added green and red bell peppers to top for added variety.  The party go'ers LOVED this!

Everyone try this dip! I took it to a superbowl party, when I said it was 'mexican dip' people immediately dug in. I brought it pretty late and they still finished it! I added a layer of queso cheese on top of the guacamole. I made the guacamole with a commercial seasoning packet. The queso cheese dip is a must, it tastes exactly like upside down nachos!!

This is a great dip, I have made it many times.  I add chopped green chilies (drained) to mine.  I like to mix them in with the sour cream and refigerate a couple of hours to let the flavors blend.

I have made this a few times now, and it always disappears quickly.  It has now become "my dish" that I bring to potlucks.  I also add the taco seasoning to the meat and sour cream and I skip the quacomole.  Thanks for a qreat, easy recipe!

This was SO EASY! Especially if you use canned chopped tomatoes and olives. Although if it were up to me I'd omit both (but that's totally a personal preference). I mixed the taco seasoning iwth the sour cream. Will definitley make this next chance I get!

Great recipe. Brought it to a party, and now everyone asks for me to bring it all the time.  I also added taco seasoning to the meat to spice it up and also heated the refried beans a little to make them easier to spread.

Dips can't get easier than this to make.  A great, rich dip.  I cut down the olives to one 3oz can.  I also microwaved the dish about a minute to melt the cheese a little.  It probably would have been okay to serve at room temperature, but I didn't like the fact that the cheese was unmelted.

Not good. This is the second time I have tried this dip and I didn't like it either time. Maybe it has to do with the brands of guacamole and salsa used. I'm not sure what went wrong but this tasted off.

This recipe was good.  I made it with or without the hamburger, either way was good.

Big hit at our July 4th party. I used homemade guacamole and a black bean salsa in my version. Also, I found I needed 16oz of sour cream vs the 8oz the recipe calls for in order to cover the cooked ground beef layer. Good snacking!

Very good! Though I think next time I'll try it with the taco seasoning to add a little more zing. It's definitely a make-ahead type dish and then we simply eat it as a meal!

This was a hit at our Christmas party.  My brother is vegetarian so I made half without beef and everyone loved it.

This recipe is great.  I used extra sour cream, it is a little difficult to spread the sour cream over the ground beef.  I doubled the recipe and took it to a Halloween party and it was all gone by the end of the night.  I would make it again!!

This recipe is a keeper.  I added some taco seasoning to the sour cream and the meat, and I also used more sour cream than the recipe called for, but it turned out perfect! Everyone loves this recipe!!

I had this at a New Years party, and I'd always wondered what was in it! Thanks for the recipe! This was by FAR the BEST dip I've ever had. All the college boys ate most of it up, but I snuck what I could. Haha.

Perfect for csasual parties!  Add a few jalepeno peppers and get more kick.  This was perfect for a labor day pool party catering to a beer/nacho crowd.
