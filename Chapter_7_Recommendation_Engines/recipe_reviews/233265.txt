This is a great recipe for a BBQ.  It was so easy to make.  The only thing I did different was to grill the corn on the cob for taste and color. I followed the rest of the recipe as It is. It wasnt too tart  after sitting in the refregerator. I will definitely make this again!

Crunchy,  sweet and sour salad. Good recipe to use when sweet corn is in season.  But, this 1st time making it, I just used  some leftover  grilled corn on the cab that came with the take outs we had for lunch. To enhance the  Tex-Mex flair, I used lime juice instead of balsamic vinegar, and just 1/2 cup of it.  I omitted the black olives, my youngest doesn't like them. I served couple of slices of avocados next to the salad, on each plate. Next time, I might chop some avocados and mixed them in the salad.

I cooked the corn on the stove with the olive oil for about 10 minutes, stirring often. I used half as much celery. Otherwise, no significant changes. Everyone loved it.

This was excellent! I did make a couple of changes but only in method and not in ingredients. For the corn, I left the ears whole and grilled them that way and then cut the kernels from the cob once they were cool enough to handle. So, no oil was needed in that step. My other change was in step 3. I added the cilantro and jalapeno to the bowl with the other veggies instead of whisking them in with the dressing. Everything gets mixed and marinated together for 2 hours in the end so I didn't want to muddle up my cilantro more than I had to. Both me and hubby really enjoyed this and it is one I will make again. I will say that it is pretty tart which is how we like it but if you want to mellow it out some you might add a teaspoon of sugar to your dressing. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!
