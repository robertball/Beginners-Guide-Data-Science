These had too much going on in them.  The red onion, bell pepper and garlic took away from the great flavor of the burger.  When making them however, I left 2 burgers plain without those as I had a picky eater over, the plain ones were great.  The barbecue sauce added a great flavor and really enhanced the flavor you look for from  a burger.  Probably wouldn't make this again, I like other variations better.

Excellent!!  I made a few changes with this burger, I made 16 really thin patties and topped 8 of them with Cheese and then placed a patty on top of it to make 8 cheese-stuffed patties, so tender, wonderful!

Wow! These are GREAT and a bit too spicy for my family. Next time I will cut the red pepper back to maybe 1 1/4 tsp instead of 2 tsp. Other than that, all I can say is WOW!

The flavor was okay, but the meat did not stick together at all.  On the grill, it was like we were cooking a meatloaf that had fallen apart.  It made a HUGE mess.  We ended up taking the meat and adding barbeque sauce for "sloppy joes".

There was way too much garlic, my kids were not impressed. I kinda liked it. I forgot to grab a bell pepper at the store and ended up putting the red onion and an Ortega chilie on the burger. Maybe if you sauteed the garlic first or you Really liked garlic a LOT, these might be better. I did not grill mine and I am glad I didn't, they fell apart too. Sorry John, better luck next time.

Had a wonderful flavor to it, I just ran into the problem of the burgers falling apart on the grill. Next time, I think I'll use an egg to help it stick together. Other than that, wonderful!

Great burger.  However, they fell apart on the grill and were even hard to eat with a fork.

I made this for my beef eating boyfriend... he said it was good but not worth the effort.  He would have been just as happy if I would have slapped the veggies on top of the cooked patty.

Too much garlic. Pretty easy to prepare though.
