This wasn't bad at all. I'm not a huge fan of artichoke (marinated or otherwise) but this was pretty good. I served it with carrot sticks & celery sticks. I bet this would be good on crackers too!

I love this dip.  I only had: some extra marinated artichokes, whipped cream cheese and honey mustard. I did not need to use any of the reserved liquid and did not have to soften the cream cheese because it was whipped style. I did not even have time to chill it.  It still turned out great. I like that it has no garlic in it. The key is to be sure you really like the mustard you are using.  Many thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will be making it often.

This was great! It was really runny to begin with which scared me but let it set up an hour and it is perfect. The flavor is there but I recommended adding a little pimento or chopped red bell pepper for color.
