This is a great chili! Complex and hearty flavors that work very well together. Not spicy and not sweet just rich and smoky. 

I added a can of corn, a can of red kidney beans and four tablespoons of sugar.

Saving this recipe to make again. I want to make a spicy hot version next time.

This is one of the better chili recipes I have come across and I will definitely make it again.  I would have given it five stars had I not tweaked the recipe somewhat.  I left out the cocoa powder and chipotle (I don't care for either) and increased the heat by adding cayenne and red pepper flakes.  I served it to my mom and boyfriend, over fritos with shredded cheese and sour cream on top, they both loved it!

This is really awesome chili! I was missing some ingredients but still turned out great. I made this on the day of the Emmy awards and there wasn't anything left. Thanks
Award winning :D

Is there anything that Guinness doesn't make better? Adding it to chili is just wonderful. This has a really nice "dark" flavor that I'm a fan of. I added some corn and kidney beans to this, and a little molasses; and instead of 1 cup of tomato paste, I added a can, plus some homemade stewed tomatoes. Also, this states to cook it for 8 hours; and I'm sure that would be even more delicious--but I only cooked it for about an hour (for a week night meal) and it's still very good. So don't overlook this recipe because it states a long cooking time---it's not necessary to cook it 8 hours, but it would still be fine if you did, I'm sure.

This recipe is excellent! It has a very harty and savory appeal. To heat it up to our liking; my wife and I added a minced chipotle pepper, Cayenne pepper ( like Shuby did), and we went with Old Rasputin for our stout beer. This is recipe is officially our go-to chili when winter comes!
