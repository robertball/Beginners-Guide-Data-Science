Tried the recipe for the first time.  Only thing I did different was add pepperoni to it and just used mozzarella instead of American cheese.  It got rave reviews from my husband and son.  We took some over to the neighbors who also loved it and asked for the recipe!    Definitely a keeper!

a little scared to make this since it didn't have many reviews but it was actually super easy and good!  everybody loved it.  i didn't use the sausage which was optional and kept thinking i should serve this with condiments but it didn't need any.  consider this recipe as a canvas - add whatever meats/cheeses you like and it's still going to be beautiful!

Im commentig on this just too add my additions. Ive been searching for a pinnable recipe to match the one I do with the frozen bread dough. Like the others, I like an Italian version with the pastrami,  salami,  ham and pepperoni.  Mozz cheese and banana peppers. The frozen dough is so easy to usr,I roll it up like a jelly roll cut slits in it and bake at 350 for 30 min. Thanks for sharing!

Overall, very good. The egg white and Parmesan cheese on top made it taste almost like a pretzel bread. Next time, we will probably substitute pepperoni for the ham and add a little bit of Alfredo for some extra moisture to balance out the crunchy shell.


--UPDATE--
After making this countless times, Hubby and I finally have figured out exactly what works for us.  We always make extra, too, since the leftovers are outstanding.  I prefer to fill mine with shredded mozzarella, salami, and turkey pepperoni.  Hubby fills his with shredded mozzarella, salami, pepperoni, and Italian chicken sausage. Really, you can't mess this up and you can make it however you want.

I'm from the Northeast and we like to add shredded lettuce and tomato to our stromboli ingredients before baking.  It's actually the best-tasting stromboli ever! This is a good recipe. I don't like American cheese, so I used shredded mozzarella and provolone. Also, I make my own dough from scratch and serve this with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.  Delicious.

While this recipe is not a low calorie recipe, it is no where near the 1700 calories per serving that they are posting.  I did the calculations per ingredient and it's still high at around 850 calories, but not 1700 as they state.

I've been making my own rendition of this for many years on XMAS Eve. I make a large pot of beef/veggie soup to go with it. I use all kinds of deli meats but my family really likes the salami/ham/pepperoni combo with mozzarella/swiss cheese. Whatever makes them happy makes me happy. A great sandwich for special occasions.

All was tremendous with this Stromboli. I used pepperoni and Italian sausage, ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Delicious.
Here's the problem it was stuck firmly to the cookie sheet so next time will use parchment paper and a touch of non stick spray. I basically had to chisel it out of the pan. Also, the bread dough should be at room temperature to manipulate into a flat bread. Otherwise, it was beautiful when it came out of the oven and very tasty.

Try adding a honey mustard to the rolled out dough before you add the other toppings. Just spread it all over gives it a moist flavour. Been doing this for years and family loves it !!!!

Making this again for supper! Kids absolutely love it! We add pepperoni and serve with a side of pizza sauce for the kids. However you certainly do not need sauce! The flavors are so good together it's kind of a shame to mask them!

Super easy to make and delicious. I skipped the sausage and used Swiss, serving with warm marinara. Next time I'm going to make the dough in the bread maker and use fresh beer bread. Great recipe!

Great recipe! Like all the other reviews on here you can't go wrong with anything you put inside. I filled mine with mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, and sautéed peppers and mushrooms. Instead of brushing with egg white, I used olive oil with garlic powder and Italian seasoning. I let bake for 15 min and then added another coat and cooked for remaining 5 min. Was a huge hit and will definitely add to the dinner rotation.

I have prepared this many, many times and our family loves it, especially grandchildren.  Have used many different meats/cheeses and for an Italian flavor, between layers of meat/cheese, sprinkle some Italian seasoning and between other layers, use garlic powder and onion powder. I sprinkle baking sheet with small amount of cornmeal and didn't use the egg white.

Great recipe for a super fast meal. Easy to make and versatile. My entire family loved it. I followed the recipe by the book without the optional sausage and it turned out perfectly. I will add this to my rotation. Next time I might add black olives or sautéed onions and peppers to add some veggies.

This is a good base recipe.  It is quick and easy.  I have change the ingredients quite a bit for my taste.  I used hot Italian sausage and added pepperoni, doubled the salami and ham.  For cheese I used pepper jack and fresh mozzarella, with a sprinkle of a good sharp cheddar (no American cheese thank you!). I seasoned with salt and pepper, but added a fresh chiffonade of basil and minced garlic and a a very light sprinkle of crush red pepper flakes. I sprinkled the egg washed bread with coarse salt, garlic and Parmesan. It was very good.  Next time I want to try some mushrooms, black olives, sweet bell pepper and maybe some pepperoncini.

I've tried this one, as well as the one using shredded roast beef and swiss cheese.  They are really good!  I do prefer using the tubes of french bread dough instead though.  Its hard to stop eating!

We liked this recipe, but I would omit the American cheese and double the Mozzarella.  I think I would also add some Italian seasoning too.

The flavor has great potential.  However we used Pillsbury pizza dough rolled up like a jelly roll, and after 18 min at 425, it was still raw in the middle.  The top was beautiful golden brown.  I recommend cooking at 350 for 20 covered and uncovered for another 10.

This was a major hit with my family, all went back for seconds! I switched the salami out for pastrami though, and completely forgot the american cheese, but it still tasted amazing! It was quick and simple to make for sure, and I was begged to make it again. They even offered to go to the store to get more ingredients! No more leftovers either!

So easy and delicious! I followed the advice of a friend to roll the dough out thin, one layer of meat, sprinkle with shredded cheese and roll up - comes out fantastic! We made a classic pepperoni and mozzarella Stromboli - so delicious! I'm excited to try other combos like mentioned, thanks for sharing!!!

I adopted several suggestions from the reviewers, so didn't follow the recipe exactly.  Basically I used less shredded mozzarella and used provolone instead of American.  It turned out to be pretty good.  I personally think the sausage just makes it too much, so next time I will pass the sausage, or use minimum for a meat lover.

This turned out great! I was afraid it would be doughy in the middle but it wasn't and now my brain is thinking of all the possibilities that can be used for filling. I used my own pizza dough recipe and I buy pre-cooked crumbled pizza sausage, so I used that and leftover ham sliced thinly.  I'm thinking about using crumbled ground beef, onions and white american cheese for cheese-steak like flavor.  Also considering canned sliced apples or cherries for dessert.

Delicious!  I did do a few changes.  I added pepperoni and I added Italian seasoning and garlic salt to the egg white.  The Italian seasoning and garlic salt was perfect baked into the crust!

Made exactly as written and my husband was impressed but I did not care for the American cheese.  Next time I'll try another cheese (maybe provolone?) and add a bit more meat.  I think I'll change the hard salami to Genoa too.  Really, you cant go wrong.  Thanks for the recipe!

A big hit with my family! I tried it for the first time and was surprised at how great it came out. Really fast, too! A few things I did different: 1. I couldn’t find frozen bread dough so I substituted it with two cans of Pillsbury Pizza Crust, one on top of the other & it worked out amazing! 2. I used the recommended amount of ground pork but double the amount of sliced ham, salami, & cheese. 3. I seasoned the ground pork with garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, & salt, while I was browning it. 4. After I closed it by pinching the borders, I flipped it so the smooth side would be up, then brushed the egg white & put it in the oven. It’s really big and I got about 15 slices out of it. Will definitely be making it again!

This turned out delicious and was so simple. I used refrigerated pilsbury pizza crust and it was so easy, no thawing or anything. I smoothed out the dough on my baking sheet, I put a smidge of marinara down the middle the did a layer of hard salami up the middle, sprinkle of mozzarella, layer of ham, layer of provolone, layer of pepperoni the layer of mozzarella. Pinched it up real good and brushed the top with olive oil and a sprinkle of garlic powder and Italian herbs. Family loved it. Fast and easy.

Very quick recipe & my family liked it. If I'm really in a rush, I could fill it with any combination of salami, ham, pepperoni or mushrooms and not have to fry the sausage. I skipped the egg white & smeared butter on top when I took it out of the oven. We'll make this again. I'll seal the top better next time.

I have made this recipe so many times and it's always a favorite of anyone who tries it. It's also very easy to get creative with other ingredients such as bacon and eggs!  This is a great dish for parties as it's very good after it cools off as well as fresh out of the oven- but don't expect it to last long! 
This is also a great dish for lunches for the week.

We used cheddar cheese, added pizza sauce, mushrooms, onions, and green pepper. Instead of folding the dough into a pocket we rolled it like a cinamon roll, cut into portions, sprinkle cheese on top and bake for 20 min at 400. Turned out delicious.

Made this according to recipe I shoukd have added more meat. Four slices of each is not enough imo, to much bread. Next time I covered the dough with pepperoni, salami, and ham, within an inch of the edges..also added about 1/2 cup of mild pepper rings...tasted great

This is lovely exactly as suggested.  Then I started playing with ingredients: vegie version, spicier and still lovely.

My most recent masterpiece was turning it into a dessert: chocolate chips, peanut butter, walnuts, coconut and cinnamon, all as potential filling.

My family is thrilled.  Sorry no pictures, I didn't have a chance.

:D

Recipe instructions were very clear. I used whole wheat (frozen pizza dough, sliced salami (not hard salami), provolone slices, sliced mozzarella, salt, pepper and the egg wash. Excellent! I made another the next day and added to all that pepperoni and fresh sliced mushrooms. Wonderful!  I will make it again and maybe change up ingredients again.

This is so easy and so yummy! I did not add sausage and used provolone and mozzarella cheese. I also sprinkled a little Parmesan on the top. I definitely should have made my dough thinner and put more filling in it and will do that next time. It was still delicious and devoured by my family.

Great way to whip up a meal or a snack using leftover lunch meat. I vacuum seal lunch meat and cheese that I know we're not going to use and label it for this Stromboli recipe. I usually add Italian dressing or pizza sauce inside the roll before baking to give it a little extra flavor and moisture.

It was absolutely delicious, but despite all the folding and pinching of the dough, the sandwich did not stay rolled up, but opened up wide.  So, I had open-faced Stromboli.  Had to use knives and forks, as it wouldn't work as finger food.

Instead of american cheese used colby jack cheese. It was great I made 2 and didn't have any left overs.
Will make it again.

Tried this on a whim when I had some leftover salami and Italian sausage that I wanted to use up. Good decision! I used provolone instead of American cheese (because we never have American cheese) and spooned a little marinara on top of the salami. The kids absolutely loved it and my wife declared it restaurant quality. The only downside to the recipe is that I’ll need to make two if I want leftovers for lunch the next day.

I made this for lunch and served it with soup and salad.  
I used turkey instead of the ham and turkey sausage for the sausage.  
I assembled it earlier in the day and brushed the egg wash on just before putting it in the oven.   The video really helped in understanding how to close the stromboli.
It did stick a little to the pan so next time I would use a little oil spray.
Everyone loved it.  I would definitely make this again.

Made as directed, except I used nonstick spray on the airbake baking sheet.  It's very good and easy.  The whole family liked it.  Good as is or with marinara dipping sauce.  I look forward to experimenting with the fillings.

I made this recipe as written. Half of my family would have preferred it without the sausage. I would recommend using white American cheese. I bought a few slices at the deli counter. American cheese works better in here than you would think because it's nice and stringy when melted. This was quick and easy to make.

Very good! I used provolone instead of American (eww!) and used pepperoni and beef as my meats. Also added marina sauce , which I guess makes it more of a calzone, but I can live with that!

This recipe deserves a lot more praising reviews! It made my mother in law very happy so this deserves 5 stars. I really enjoyed making and eating this. I had to make my own Italian Sausage en bread dough because we don’t really have that in Holland. Not really ‘simple’ but it turned out great!

I often make it with sliced pepperoni, provolone and muenster cheeses,  and sautéed sliced onion and peppers.  Delish!  After baking, pre-slice 1" pieces and serve as appetizer.  It is great to contribute to a guest's house party in a pretty dish or basket.  I have used frozen white bread or pizza dough with equal success.

This is pretty good basic strombolli if you are just starting out making it. I don't like American cheese except on a sandwich so I use cheddar. Also, my family thinks strombolli is too dry and they don't like dipping it so I use some marinara inside before baking.

It turned out amazing! I put provolone on it as well as the mozzarella. I also added Parmesan, oregano and parsley on top to give it a little more flavor. Can't wait to make this again and again.

This is an absolute hit! Great for a finger food meal. I added red pepper flakes to the meat and black olives, that was the only deviation. This will be made again, for sure!!

I have nothing to say about changes (thank you for the recipe).  All I have to say is that my family loved this.  No, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I don't think you could screw this up.  I did two loves of bread.  They rose most of the day.  I then had to roll them out with a pin and a little flower.  After that, I just filled them with love.  I did one with some pepper jack cheese, many meats, and mozzarella.  The other I did with a little crushed garlic, spread a little ricotta cheese, put some hard salami,  more mozzarella,  spinach, more meat, and provolone.  Perfect!!!  Covered them both with a swipe of egg whites and then a little butter plus garlic salt and Italian blend seasoning.  I'm in love...  It was awesome.  I warmed up pizza sauce for the dipping sauce.  Easy, easy, easy, and my family loved it!!!

Very very good and super easy to make.  We substitute the American cheese with provolone and used mozzarella singles instead of shredded.  Also went with Italian sausage.  Came out great!  Lowered the oven temp to 420 to use parchment paper for extra simple clean up.  Try this recipe you and your family will be very happy!

The bread dough was horrible to work with.  I ended up cutting the dough into thirds and making 3 individual ones.  Added a bit of pizza sauce as well.  They ended up being huge, way too much dough.  Next time I will use refrigerated pizza dough.

The recipe was good! For personal preference, I'd use less sausage next time, and do a better job rolling it (mine opened up in the oven). Round two, put the crease on the bottom, dusted top with oregano, and doubled the ham. So good!

Good flavors but did not present well.  I tried 3x using different "bread" options: Pillsbury French Bread roll; Pillsbury Pizza dough roll and frozen bread.  None came out great and all leaked ingredients and was not able to create a full wrap around.  I added a thin spread of pizza sauce and it was helpful for enhancing the flavors.  Overall good flavors, just too messy and not able to serve to guests.

Everyone loves it, especially with marinara sauce on it.  The reviews (and recipe notes) are right about using whatever meats and cheeses suit you.  I use grated cheddar instead of american cheese and a bit of Parmesan too with the mozzarella.  Also, I roll mine instead of folding and let it stand a bit, maybe 30 minutes, before baking.  That way I get an upstanding roundish loaf instead of a flat result.  With the round loaf you can put little decorative cuts in the top before baking.  As for "pinching and sealing edges", it works to just put it seam-side down after rolling and tuck the ends under a little.

Just tried this for the first time. Amazingly easy!!  I skipped the sausage just because I forgot to make it and we were starving. I added some cream cheese before laying the meats and cheeses down. I used Colby Jack instead of American because I like that better. Could probably add pizza sauce but it was still fabulous.

So good...I did put pizza sauce on it before laying down the meat because it sounded good to me. Make sure you let it bake and don't try to check on it or pinch the dough back together in the middle of baking. It may open up a little bit but it won't fall apart. It's so delicious

Easy and delicious.  I like to pat the dough out on a floured surface and place it seam side down  to keep it from breaking open while baking.  This time I filled one with roasted veggies  with olive oil and Italian herbs and cheese...so good.  There is no downside to this recipe  except  for the calories.  By the way, my chubby hubby lost 200 lbs.  He won't  eat much of this, just a taste.

Delicious.    I brushed the dough with a mixture of olive oil and Italian seasoning and then a little roasted tomato pizza sauce for flavor.   Then added toppings (skipped the American cheese due to family taste preference).   My family said they prefer this over pizza now.   Would definitely recommend to others to try.

Now this is a recipe right up my alley - easy and yummy!  I used 2 loaves of dough, hard salami, and ground hamburger with 1 package of mozzarella divided between the 2 loaves. Used a milk wash cos didn't have an egg. Cooked for 17 min. Excellent!

I love the idea and minimal work for this recipe. Using frozen pizza dough is my new obsession because it's delicious. However I or my family did not like the fillings for this recipe. I'll try different combinations in the future.

Made this with the Bridgeford brand Frozen Dough.
Filling was Pepperoni, Hard Salami Soprassato and Ground Sausage, with Parmesan and Cheddar Cheese.

It was AWESOME!  and super easy.

quick tip for thawing the bread dough (if you're an impatient/ poor planner like me):
Stick it in the oven on a greased cookie sheet, and set the oven to preheat at it's lowest setting (mine was 170), as soon as the oven dings to let you know it's heated, turn it off, and leave the dough in their. Once the oven cool back down again you can repeat... this is also a good trick for helping it to rise.  I had my dough thawed in about 20 minutes this way.

Great recipe! Perfect for a cold day, it's the definition of comfort food. I left out the American Cheese because my fiancee is lactose intolerant, and I only did about 6 oz of Mozzarella. It didn't take away from the recipe at all. I also used mild Italian ground sausage. The one thing with this recipe I found slightly inaccurate is how thick the dough should be. It says 3/4 inch thickness, but I thought that was WAY too thick. I did about maybe 1/4 inch and that seemed just about right. However, I guess it totally depends on how your bread dough turns out, I made mine from scratch because I couldn't find the frozen one at my store. It tastes great with a little marinara or pizza sauce to give it some moisture to the bread. I would 100% make this again.

I have made this recipe a least once a week since finding it. Each time I have used different fillings, some from leftovers.  Left over crockpot Italian beef with mozzarella cheese and roasted red peppers was the best so far. You do have to make sure it is dry so I drained it on a per towels first.  Will keep making it as it is so adaptable!

Very good and easy to make.  As others, did not use American cheese, only Mozzarella.  Added some turkey pepperoni and mild banana peppers.  I brushed olive oil on top with some spices but wish I would have used the egg white to make it crusty.

OMG! This was delicious! I could only find frozen artisan flat bread so got that, some ham, some salami, some pepperoni and a variety of cheese. My grocery store had buy one get one free on fresh pasta sauces so I got some pesto in addition to the marinara sauce and brushed the bread with pesto. As most reviewers have said, this is a great idea that you can tweak to your liking. A recipe that will remain in our rotation. Thank you so much!

I pretty much followed instructions with regard to the prep.  I did make two separate stromboli (strombolis?) with different meats and cheeses in each.  Both were fantastic.

I did make two changes:  1. Patted out the bread dough to 3/8 inch or so.  2.  After pinching the dough once, twice, thrice I flipped the stromboli over so the seam was on the bottom.

The thinner dough was still pretty thick once it cooked.  I cannot imagine what 3/4 inch would have been like.   Flipping the stromboli over was "borrowed" from the Stromboli Bites recipe on this site.

Overall I would say this was a success.  I made this for a New Year's Eve party that had a TON of food.  This was the only item to be gone before the ball dropped.  Make it.  You will not regret it.

Number of servings (3) was spot on - no leftovers.  I used ham, salami, and pepperoni for the meats,  and Swiss and mozzarella for the cheeses.  I followed other reviewers advice and sprinkled each layer with Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder alternately.  I also added sautéed red peppers between the cheese layers and topped the finished product with olive oil and Italian seasoning rather than the egg wash.  I baked the Stromboli on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Although the taste was excellent, the dish was a tad dry.  I will make it again and probably add some thinly sliced tomatoes to the meats and cheeses and maybe some sautéed onions or mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe, Judy.  It was so easy to make and looked great also.

Since  the sausage was optional, I did not use it.   I used Rhode frozen bread which did not stick together no matter what I did including following the instructions on the video.   I baked it and it split on top.  The bread was hard and the filling did not taste very good.  I actually threw it out after tasting one small slice.

I only gave this recipe four stars because I made a few simple changes: I used pizza dough instead of bread dough because that's what was available. I used provolone cheese and mozzarella. I threw in some roasted red peppers and I use an egg wash with paprika and seasoned salt (I used a whole egg, not egg whites because I'm terrible at separating eggs). Oh, and I baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes. That being said, this was my first Stromboli and it was awesome - we both loved it!

Lots of bread, not much filling. If I made this again I would add more filling, add some Italian seasonings, possibly pepperoni, olives  and omit the american cheese.  Definitely serve with marinara sauce.

Pretty good!  I couldn't find frozen bread dough so used frozen pizza dough instead and that worked out just fine!  Some marinara sauce for dipping was all that it needed.  I did let it sit in the oven with the burners off for until the 30 minute mark just to make sure it was cooked all the way though.

First time I made this, the center broke open. My teenaged daughter says "Silly Dad, next time just turn it over before baking." What a great idea! This dish goes well with a light soup and marinara for dipping. Thank you for this recipe.

We made these and liked them.  We did them with ham, pepperoni, green pepper and mozzarella filling, then sprinkled some italian herbs and parmesan on top of them before baking.
Will make again, but will go heavier on the fillings but otherwise we consider this one a success.

I used Pillsbury french bread dough as I didn't have time to thaw frozen. Ham, salami, provolone, and mozzarella inside. Sprinkled a sea salt/herbs mix on top of the bread before baking. Turned out fantastic! So easy and a big hit - yay!

I made this using Italian bulk sausage, added pepperoni, used provolone cheese. It met with great reviews from the family. I've also made it with refrigerated original dough as that was all I had and it turned out well. I serve with pizza sauce for dipping. A definite keeper.

Giving it 5 stars because the flavor was amazing and it tasted delicious, but would have to say I had a hard time rolling it tight enough because of the hard salami being so stiff.  Despite the egg wash, there was mass leakage of  melted cheese.  

I didn't use any sausage.  I used Genoa salami, porchetta, provolone and mozzarella.  I also put some genovese  pesto and dried oregano in as well to amp up the Italian flavor. 

I also think I mishandled the dough and it got too soft. It sat out thawing and rising for hours, then I stretched it out and made the mistake of letting it sit out and it rose again. By the time I assembled it, the dough was very fragile and thin.  Also hubby said his dough was undercooked on the bottom,  but I think it was just too wet from marinara and didn't crisp up. Oh well, next time.

I started making this stromboli at least 30 years ago. I used ground beef & coated inside of dough w/tomato soup. Since then, I've learned how to make my own pizza dough, which makes a difference. But this recipe is just fine. I also added pepperoni & mozzarella cheese.

It was really good. I left out the American cheese and added a little garlic salt to the top. Also I put some corn meal on the bottom of the baking sheet to make sure it didn't stick.

it looks delish, but doesn't the bread get thick?  It looks thin in the pic but if you are only spreading to 3/4 in thick it is going to rise, correct?

Family loved this! I skipped the American cheese and used Monterey Jack and Mozzarella cheese. Also we used Italian sausage and salami as the two meat items. Delicious!

This was very tasty & easy to prepare!  My grocery store didn't have the frozen bread so I bought a boxed bread mix and prepared it as instructed. The whole result was great. Very flexible to use any preferred filling preferred.

Now this was a hit... I made it according to the recipe without the ground sausage for my roommate and neighbor... and they ate it all... then I made one using turkey and chicken for myself it was awesome too... so much so that roommate asked me to freeze the left overs so that he can have it for lunch/dinner on nights when I'm not home.

Definitely too salty.  Needs sauce, which is not mentioned.  I won't make it again.  Oops, they do mention marinara sauce as an option.  For this recipe, it's a "must have."

I have only had Stromboli once before and loved it so thought I would try this recipe. I followed the recipe but used provolone instead of American cheese and I added a sprinkling of garlic powder, parsley & oregano. Extremely easy to assemble. I sliced the top before baking which makes for easier slicing once its cooked. The taste was yummy but I thought that the sausage flavor was overpowering & next time I will cut sausage in half or even substitute pepperoni. Would be good served with red sauce.

I'm very excited about this recipe, since 
     over the years I've forgotten how very versatile the frozen bread dough can be.  Thanks for reminding me about it, and also thank you very much for this delicious "Stromboli" recipe.
     Instead of using plain old American Cheese, I used Provalone Cheese.... because it has a lot more flavor.  The dish turned out perfectly, so thank you very much.

Made as directed, except used pork belly brushed with honey mustard that my sis coincidentally brought over. This was my first attempt and notice one reviewer baked at lower temp for longer time. Any strong opinions about this? Thanks, very very good. Taking to sister's house for football tomorrow. Go Hawks!

It was awesome! The healthy twist included chicken sausage, low fat mozzarella, and smaller amounts of ham and salami for flavor without added fat. It did not take away from the flavor at all.

Yes I made 2 changes, first I add a small amount of pasta or pizza sauce before baking, it adds a little moisture to the sandwich and some pepperoni. It is great.

Great basic recipe to riff on. I used leftover Harvey Ham (from this website) and muenster to fill it this last time. Delicious! But have also made it the way the recipe is written and people rave about it!

Not sure what happened, but we did not like the way this turned out.  After cooking it the amount of time the recipe called for, the dough was almost over cooked on top, but still gooey in the middle.  It was kind of gross.  Sorry...won't be making this again. :(

actually rather tasty the only problem I had was I had to use pizza dough. The one pound frozen bread was unavailable. Instead of Hard salami I used Genoa salami.

This meal is extremely simple to make, it's a perfect lunch on the weekend. I didn't use sausage, but used ham, pepperoni, onions, mushrooms and of course cheese. It was yummy especially with pizza sauce on the side for dipping.

Used frozen pizza dough. Used salami, shaved smokes ham, turkey pepperoni & hormel bacon bits. Dabbled a little pizza sauce  lots of mozzarella cheese and lastly minced garlic from jar just a little all over. Baked at 410 degrees for 20 minutes. After pulling it out it rubbed butter all over and sprinkles garlic powder on the top. My kids loved it

I have been making stromboli at home for years. 

The only thing I do differently is buy refrigerated Pillsbury pizza dough in the canister with the biscuits. I unroll, add cheese and toppings then roll back up. I cut 3 slits in the top and cook.

The toppings I use are mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, salami, pepperoni, black olives, banana peppers and sometimes pineapple chunks.

I serve with marinara on the side. It's always a huge hit here!

Simple and amazing! Reminds me of the Stromboli that was served in the lunchroom growing up. I sprinkle it with Parmesan cheese after brushing the dough with the egg white.

Used pizza dough.  Brushed with egg white mixed with parmesan and dried basil.  Baked on parchment paper.  Fast, easy and delicious.

This amazing recipe was easy and delicious! I had been trying to making it and it definitely worth the wait. Sisters and others all had their stomachs growling for more. Great recipe. I will be sure to make it again. ( instead of American Cheese I just did mozzarella.)

Great, easy and fun recipe!! I added red and green bell peppers with my italian sausage, used pizza dough instead! Turned out great! Next time I will smash everything down before baking to make it more flat instead of a mound shape!

This recipe was delicious and super easy to make. I replaced the ham with sliced pepper turkey and it was so GOOD! My boyfriend also loved it and ate it for 3 meals in a row (dinner, breakfast, dinner) which has never been done before.

This recipe is delicious and fairly inexpensive to make. I think I made one serving for around $5.50 
(I like provolone which can get pretty pricey)

But either way- $5.50  sure the heck beats the $8.00- $9.00 I pay at the local pizza shop and this one tastes a heck of a lot better too!

First time making it couldn't get the dough to roll out quite right so mine looked a little wonky but it still tasted delicious anyway! So as long as you're okay with it not looking like your favorite pizza joint's Stromboli- you're good to go!

Made this recipe twice, and both family and friends loved it.  The first time I used the sausage, but the second time I used pepperoni because I had it on hand.  Both times it was great!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Family and friends loved it! I used sweet italian sausage and used frozen thin crust pizza dough from the tube and it was the perfect size. Making again today my family loved it that much

I couldn't find frozen bread dough anywhere.  So I used the refrigerated croissant dough.  I smashed it into a ball and then rolled it out with a rolling pin.  I placed all the meat (ham, salami, peperoni, crumbled Italian sausage) and cheese to the outer edge of this now rectangle shaped dough and rolled it up, pinching the ends and seams to keep the contents inside.  I baked it for 17 minutes and lightly buttered the top when I took it out of the oven.  Yummy with or without the marinara sauce and is excellent cold the next day.  If you enjoy the taste of croissants, give this a try.  Awesome hot or cold!  If you like green pepper, throw it in as it's wonderful!!  I'm making one of these every week!  Love it!  A few more ideas that I've seen, cook your pepperoni crisp like on top of a pizza.  After using the egg white, salt it generously.  Gives it that pretzel kind of taste someone else mentioned.  Also, when I take it out of the oven, I slant the cookie sheet with paper towel at the bottom of the cooking sheet to absorb the grease that drains from the sandwich.  Love this!!  I did find frozen bread dough at an International Grocery Store.

The whole family loved this recipe!  I try to provide healthy meals when I can so I made a few modifications.  I used a whole wheat pizza dough ball instead. Low fat chicken sausage, turkey pepperoni and a layer of fresh spinach (not too much for fear of being watery).  I always use the regular cheese -dont even think of using low fat.
