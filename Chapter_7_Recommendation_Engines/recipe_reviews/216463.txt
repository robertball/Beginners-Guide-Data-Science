Just a note from the creator of this recipe:  It was edited to recommend cooking it for two hours or until 180 degrees.  This is not the way I would advise.  One rotisserie-sized chicken should not take any longer than 1 1/2 hours, at most.  Also, the temperature will continue to rise with resting.  Feel free to cook the chicken in your normal fashion, the recipe cook times here are obviously on the cautious side!  :)  PS- This recipe can also be used on chicken breasts or pieces, and should make enough to be used more than once, depending on the size of the bird or how many pieces used.

I only made the spice mix so my review is based on that. We absolutely love it! I've been using it as an all purpose lower salt mix on everything. Very flavorful. I did use less sage to make it more all purpose. I only had celery flakes instead of seed. I used a bit less salt, but only because my husband has high blood pressure & we eat very low salt. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be making it often.

Great recipe for roasted chicken! What a wonderful blend of herbs and spices! I rubbed the chicken and let it marinate for a full 24 hours which I highly recommend.  Perfect for Sunday dinner. Thanks for a great recipe Sarah!

This kind of chiken I serve each Friday dinner to my children and grandchildren...:) I just omit the onion, I refrigerate it for nearly 8 hours, bake it in in a pre heated 375 F hot oven for ONLY 1 1/4 hours, it come crispy and so moist , not dry at all. Baste once during the baking. Instead of whole chicken I use only the lower parts of the chicken. ( leg and thigh) Enjoy.

I really enjoyed this.  I have never actually roasted a whole chicken before so this was a big step for me.  I didn't have all the ingredients (celery seed) but it tasted great.  What I did differently...added a little olive oil to the skin and then roasted it at 450 for 15' to crisp the top and then at 350 for the duration which was about an hour and a half.  It turned out very moist and very tasty.  There were nice juices on the bottom of the pan that would make a righteous gravy.  Will definitely do again.

I haven't tried this one yet but I am going out to get the ingredients I don't have!  I have a suggestion for almost any roast chicken- sprinkle the chicken/pieces liberally with ground ginger and/or add some to the other ingredients.  It just does something to enhance the flavor even more, and you can't really taste the ginger as ginger itself, even if the ginger is all you use before the baking. I have been doing this for years.  I did this with the Thanksiving turkey this year and our guest said it was the best ever and what did I do to it?? Fantastic.

We really enjoyed this one, more than others I’ve done in the past!!  Thank you, Sarah!!  The seasoning blend is wonderful and I liberally coated the entire bird, which gave it tons of flavor.  Yesterday on the Recipe Buzz, I caught up with Sarah and she suggested using the seasoning blend on veggies, in particular potatoes.  Now, that’s one I’ll have to try soon.  Well, I knew ahead of time that this chicken was going to be delicious, because my kitchen smelled fabulous while this was roasting away.  We’ll be enjoying some of the leftovers in chicken sandwiches tonight!

This was quite delicious!  On Sarah's recommendation I tired it with some drumsticks and split breasts I had on hand.  Everyone loved it!  I had only used a dry rub on ribs before and was not sure how it would turn out on poultry.  It was so good!  Definitely a keeper and will make often.  Thanks Sarah!

My hubby took one bite of the half turkey breast from Trader Joe's and said, "YUM!"  That says it all to me.  I put a healthy dose of the herbs under the skin and more on top.  I roasted this for two hours on 350.  Perfect!   The flavors of the herbs blended well together.  I saved some of the rub in my empty dried parsley container for another time.  Delicious, Sarah!  Thank you!

I made this for the first time and everyone LOVED IT!!!!  Instead of using a whole chicken, I used chicken parts.  Next time I plan to use the entire chicken.  I cooked the chicken @ 375 for an 1 1/4 hour as one user suggested.

This is an amazing rub!  I tried it on our beercan chicken roaster and it came out wonderful!  We used apple cider instead of beer for the roaster and this rub and it was simply divine!  Loved it! Thanks Sarah!

will be making this tonight, but wanted to start writing my review as to what i changed in the spice mix... i halved the mix (which is plenty still). didn't have enough parsley so i used some marjoram and rosemary as well, not enough thyme so i used Italian seasoning to make up the difference, hot chili powder instead cayenne and added 1/2-1 tsp. ground fennel seeds. can't wait to try it.

Wonderful chicken!  I'm rating the spice blend itself and not the cooking method.  I didn't change any of the measurements of the spices and it turned out wonderful.  I coated boneless skinless chicken breasts with olive oil and then sprinkled the dry rub on liberally.  I then drizzled more olive oil on top.  I baked these at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and had tasty, tender and juicy chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe Sarah!

Very good rub but do not put too much of it on...and also this recipe definitely need to be marinated otherwise the flavors of the rub do not really get into the chicken. Omit pepper if you do not like it too spicy.

GREAT dry rub for chicken! the only thing I left out was the onion because I didn't have any on hand and I was short on time, so instead of letting it marinade for a few hours I rubbed on & baked. It turned out really flavorful and the drippings made for an excellent gravy. thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed this rub on a chicken and some sliced, roasted potatos.  I would probably adjust for taste if we used it again, decreasing the sage and coriander a bit.  One onion was enough for a 4.5lb chicken cook time was definitely more than 1.5 hours.  I would probably increase the temperature a little in the future for a crispier skin.

This was very good.  I did not have enough cayenne pepper nor did I have any onion powder, (used dried onion flakes), garlic powder, (used garlic salt and omitted sea salt) nor did I have any paprika.  But this still turned out really good.  Thanks for sharing!!

Sarah's Dry Rubbed Chicken Haiku: "Reduced recipe, and used on two chicken breasts. Oh my, this is good!" I rubbed this on thick and goopy on two chubby chicken breasts, put in fridge for recommended 4 hrs., browned both sides 2-3 min. over med-hi in half butter/half EVOO, and finished off in a 350 deg. oven for 20 min. Smelled divine, perfect chicken moisture and texture, and taste was outstanding - even w/ all of those seasonings that went into it, none overpowered any of the others - they all came together so beautifully that I've recently made a triple batch of this to keep in a tuperware and use on chicken again.

I now keep a jar of this dry rub in my spice cabinet so I have it handy, it is so good.  I use it on more than chicken, it is a great rub on pork tenderloin as well.  It makes a perfect rub for a rotisserie chicken, better than any store bought!

this created a wonderful rub, my husban is not much of a chicken eater......but it was the first thing cleared from his plate. he loved it. which mean he will be having it often. I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken because we are only too and i hate to waste food. thank you so much for a great recipe. i will be using it often.

"Sarah's Dry Rubbed Chicken" is the perfect meal in the category of "quick and easy" although it does take time to cook. It was very tasty. I had 9 tablespoons of spice mixture, which I think is enough to make this recipe at least 4 times. I cut my chicken open along the spine and laid it out flat in my open enameled cast-iron pan, and it browned up very nicely this way. I will be inclined to throw some potatoes and carrots underneath it next time. Thank you Sarah for sharing your recipe.

Oh my goodness this is good! I wasn't able to use every ingredient, but what I did have worked great! I put 1 tbsp of everything (except cayenne, celery seed and coriander). I only have smoked paprika and wanted to be careful with the heat; also I used only 1 tsp sea salt. It only got to rest with the rub for about an hour, then into a 375 oven for one hour and 15 minutes. Then turned the heat down to 350 for about 15 more minutes. The flavor this rub gives the chicken, perfect herbs and spices, is delicious! I have made many roasted chickens and used other rubs, with some of the same ingredients, but this combination topped them all! I will definitely make this over and over. Thank you Sarah.

I only made the rub, so my review is based on that portion only. I made a half batch and rubbed a bone-in turkey breast and cooked it in the crockpot for 5 hours (first hour on high, then low the remaining time). My husband can not have powdered garlic or onion but can have real onion and garlic. I rubbed the breast with garlic infused olive oil, then used the rub. I cut a large onion and additional garlic cloves and put them in and around the breast. Both my husband and DS commented how good it was! I used the leftover turkey to make a pot pie and it was just as well received! Thank you! I will definitely use this rub again in the future!!

These were the best roasted pumpkin seeds I have ever had. I think the secret is roasting them at a low temp for a long time turning often. You can add whatever seasoning you like. I put the seeds in a bowl with all of the ingredients’ and marinate in the fridge until I get the 3 cups. I think this brought out moor of the flavor. Thank you so much for posting.

This was great. Didn't use all the rub and it was a 5.5 lb chick. Could only get 1/2 an onion in it. Definitely cook at least 12 min.a lb. Which is what I do for a free range turkey. You'd think a small chick. would be less. Anyhow I kept it in the refer over night. And served it to guests..serve experiments to the guests! LOL. I did the first 10 min at 450 and had the breast up and after the 10 min turned it over and turned the oven down to 350...so the breast was down. More moist that way. It was flavorful and moist! A very good recipe and I am picky! I will do it again and again and again!Well when I remember to do it the night before! I would recommend "soaking"it over night.

180° at the bone and tin foil cover produce a dry chicken thigh. I removed chicken from the oven after thermometer reached 177° at the bone. I would recomend 170° and cut into chicken to the bone and decide if covering is necessary. I also will cut the sage from 2 teaspoons to 1 the next time i make the rub. The spice rub was excellent with the sage being an exception for my taste
 yours my differ

I didn't have a few of the spices so I used abt 1/2 tblsp of poultry seasoning. It worked out really well. I'm using this rub again. Smoked a whole chicken using the rub and it was really good too.

I have made this plenty of times on chicken. It's just divine. I decided to smoke a turkey for thanksgiving in pecan wood smoking chips. I rubbed this on the bird first, in an olive oil/spice from this recipe. OMG I just about fell over, then landed in heaven! I will be using this rub for every roasted and smoked bird from now on. You are brilliant Ms Sarah!!!!

'Reading all the great reviews, I was ready for a hit; but it didn't happen.  Only change was reducing the thyme by half.  This made enough for two whole chickens & some leftover.  It wasn't bad, not at all; but nothing special, memorable.  It wasn't spicy, which was okay; but I did expect it to be.

This seasoning blend was fantastic! It had the right amount of kick to it without being too spicy for the kids (or me!). I mixed up the spices, and then used it for a whole chicken in the crock pot, and it turned out great. So easy and uses spices that we have around the house all the time, so no need for any extra shopping trips. Great recipe that I'm sure I will be making again! Thank you for sharing your recipe, Sarah!

wow the seasoning blend was awesome! i cut the recipe in half and used it on a 5 lb chicken.. i made sure to rub the mix under the skin and on top.. we cooked this on the grill and split the chicken down the middle so we obviously didn't use the garlic or onion.. i didn't have dried parsley so i left it out and used kosher salt for sea salt.. i used ground sage and ground thyme so i only put 1/8 tsp each.. ty so much for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE.. i think i finally perfected this for us.. i cut the rub down even further to 1/4 the original recipe.. keeping the 1/8 tsp of sage the same but cutting it down to 1/16 tsp for the thyme.. i subbed 1 tsp of table salt for the sea salt.. added a little bit of canola oil and cider vinegar to make a paste and rubbed this under the skin and outside as well.. grilled this beer can chicken style so left out the garlic and onion that would have been stuffed in the cavity.. this is absolutely delicious.. i'm so glad i stumbled across this recipe.. it's a regular staple in our house

Tried this rub today for our Christmas Chicken and its soooooo delicious. What I did different is I cooked my roaster chicken in a bag. IT Turned out super juicy.
