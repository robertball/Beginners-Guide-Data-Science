I had to make this recipe twice to get it right.  The 4 cups of milk is too much.  I cut it down to two cups of milk and the pie set up very quickly.  It is a very good, but very sweet pie.  I cut it into 16 pieces not 6 and that seemed to be enough pie per serving.

THERE IS NO WAY THIS RECIPE USES 4 CUPS OF MILK!  I MADE 2 PIES WITH THIS RECIPE AND NEITHER OF THEM EVEN SET UP.  I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH MILK IT NEEDS.  IF SOMEONE HAS AN IDEA PLEASE RESPOND, I WOULD LOVE TO TRY AND MAKE THIS AGAIN BUT I AM NOT GOING TO RUIN ANY MORE GRAHAM CRACKER CRUSTS TO EXPERIMENT.

I would love for this recipe to work. Mine didn't set up either and I got 2 pies, very runny, yet very tasty from this recipe.  Does Annie Parsons hear this?  Please respond.  Thanks.

I'm being charitable by giving this one star. As with the other commenters I discovered that four cups of milk is WAY too much! Having wasted a fair amount of time and ingredients for this, I'll wait a bit before attempting it again.

The changes I made wasI cut the down the sugar and the milk to  I cup of sugar and 2 cups of milk. I used the amount of pureed cantaloupe that was said chunked. I did not use the microwave. I used the stove.. I mixed the pureed cantaloupe, cornstarch , sugar, egg vanilla , butter, and milk in a bowl. Then added it to a pot cooked on low heat stirring until it coats the back of the spoon,Poured in to the crust and chilled.. This sets well... It makes 2 pies.
