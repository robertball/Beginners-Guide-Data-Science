I also made this with no changes. So delicious! I did not bake any sweet potato pies this Thanksgiving and did not miss them. Do not leave off the pecans. They definitely add to the texture and flavor.

This was good but waaaaaay too sweet. Next time I will definitely adjust the brown sugar/butter topping maybe just do half. With the vanilla and marshmallows it was overwhelming.

I made this exactly as the recipe suggests and it was incredible! Best sweet potatoes ever - and made the marshmallow and pecan-crust crowd equally happy
