This was great!  I made some changes that worked out wonderfully and thought I'd share them.  I use phyllo dough that fit in and up the sides of the muffin tins.  I also added some more salt, garlic powder and used sharp cheddar.  Delicious!

Quick and easy....I used chopped green onion for colour.  I would also suggest chopping a little ham or cooked bacon for flavor.  Excellent and quick!

These were very good. I liked them even better than a large quiche. I added crumbled bacon to the tops in the last 5 minutes of cooking.
Thanks for sharing

Impressive! First I rolled the bread slices flat with a heavy rolling pin and buttered them and placed them (buttered side down) inside silicon cupcake cases which made them very easy to remove. I got two circles per slice of bread. I cut out the circle shapes with an empty mushroom can but you could use a cookie cutter or even egg rings. I added bacon and parsley though this is a great base recipe to play with...try adding asparagus, mushrooms, bell pepper, chicken, corn, etc etc. Great snacks or to pass around as party finger food.

These definitely are just as the title states "Easy Mini Quiche".  They were so easy to make and perfect little last minute appetizer.  I used a biscuit cutter to trim the bread into circles. I sprayed the bottom of the muffin tins with a little Pam and them placed the bread inside. I added an extra egg to the mixture, some chopped Canadian bacon, 1/4 tsp. each of salt, garlic powder, & onion powder, 1/2 cup of chopped green onion instead of regular and substituted American cheese for the Swiss. I would definitely make these again.

This recipe was so quick, easy, and yummy!  I did make some adjustments however.  I didn't trim my bread, but rather molded it to the muffin tin as the crust.  I used american cheese instead of swiss, but I guess any cheese would do.  I also added a little bit more milk and an extra egg because it looked like it needed it.  As well as a bit of garlic powder to the egg mixture.  Came out PERFECT!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

Excellent! I made myself one for middle of the night snack, and it was simple! I didn't even have muffin tins, so I just made a round cup out of tin foil, and that worked perfectly.

These taste good..., in fact I left out the onions and just made them w/ chz. and my one year old daughter LOVES them,.. but they are time consuming to make since you have to trim the bread slices to fit into the muffin cups. Also,.. even w/ greased cups mine stuck terribly. Good overall, but not GREAT.

I don't know if it's fair to call it quiche, but they taste good! With a little added colour, courtesy of red pepper finely diced and some spring onion, these look great with a green salad as an appetizer. I've made them several times, and they turn out fine. Tip: You can quickly trip the bread by taking a cup og glass, and making circles. Or just cut off the crust and mold it in!

Great fun to make. I did grease my muffin tins before adding in my bread circles. I used a quality multigrain bread. For a creamier "quiche" filling, I did use fat free evaporated milk and I threw in a half cup or so of chopped breakfast sausage links I had in the back of my freezer. My husband wasn't too keen on them but the kids and I thought it was great. I especially liked it because it was quick and easy--that's always a win in my book. I think this would work just as well with leftover (cooked) whomp biscuits, you know the layered kind? Just split them in thirds or fourths and smush them in the bottom of your muffin tin. That way, nothing's wasted.

Excellent base recipe! I went an easier route and used bagged garlic & butter croutons and tossed a few of those in each muffin cup.  Then I used microwave bacon (the kind that is already cooked and you just heat it up) crumbled up, shredded swiss in some, baby spinach leaves & green onion plus added salt & pepper.  These turned out great. Don't forget to spray your muffin tins thoroughly and no sticking!  I also did the same with a mix of mexican shredded cheese, bacon and green onion and these were also great.  The croutons helped make it more like a breakfast casserole in serving size.  I'm going to use this during the holidays this year and will keep experimenting with fillings. Thanks for the ideas!

TO PREVENT SOGGINESS: Flatten the bread with a rolling pin and spread butter on the bottoms  FOR FLAVOR: Add crumbled bacon, salt, plenty of cheese, chopped tomatoes, whatever you think would be yummy!  FOR AN EASIER, BETTER ALTERNATIVE:  Instead of bread, use refrigerated biscuits, smash them flat and put them in the muffin tins.  You can still add fun stuff to the egg mixture, but the biscuits bake better and add a little more flavor

WOW!  I love quiche and this is the easiest recipe I have ever seen. I just add favorite things like mushrooms or broccoli...and use the flavor of shredded cheese I have at the time. Very fun and tasty!! (I also use 2 circles per slice of bread so I don't waste bread. The corner of one of the circles is cut off..but no one notices.) Thanks for a great recipe!

I agree that this is a good basic recipe.  I would highly suggest to add any of your favs to add some flavor.  Bacon, shrooms, asparagus, anything that you have on hand.  Fill the cups completely.  It will puff up and once removed from oven, they will settle down some.  I too got 2 rounds of bread from one slice.  I used a small drinking glass to cut my rounds. Spray Pam generously, run a sharp knife around edges and should be easily removed from the pan. I had to add a few more minutes to the baking time. You want to make sure that they won't be soggy.
Use you imagination, you can't go wrong.

Great, easy and tasty recipe!  A good way to use up the ends of bread and other leftovers.  I used some mixed stewed marinated vegetables including onions, celery, bell peppers and mushrooms, and I used some parmesan and cheddar I had leftover from easter as well. Very tasty, easy to re-warm and easy to eat.  I adapted the recipe to be healthier by using one egg and 4 egg whites (I made a 3/4 batch of the egg mixture due to using large pieces of bread), and 2% milk.  You could adapt it further by using even lower fat milk, low fat cheese, and, potentially, egg substitute (although I prefer to have a mix of eggs and egg whites due to flavor and nutrients).

I made the mistake of trying these in mini muffin tins.  The bread took over half of the room....making the 'quiches' very dry, and more like scrambled egg on bread.  The dog liked them, though.  Wouldn't make again.

I love quiche! I didn't use bread for the bottom instead i rolled out a simple pie crust and put them all around the muffin tins, it made it taste great! I also added another egg because I didn't think there was enough batter to completely fill all my muffin tins the first time. I used a blend of shredded cheese, sautéed onions and some bacons to fill my cups. Super cute and super delicious!

These were pretty good.  I used pumpernickel bread and cheddar jack cheese, and added chopped ham and some basil to the mix.  Pretty tasty.  I would make these again.

Good but wouldn't desire to make it again.  It wasn't something to brag about really.  It was more like eating an egg sandwich....add some tomatoes or chopmeat and it would be better.

These were very tasty!  I used green onions as that is what I had, and Monterrey jack cheese because I had no Swiss.  I used pam in the muffin tins to prevent sticking.  I will be making these again- next time I may try switching it up a bit for different flavors!

I just ate one and it tasted like soggy egg bread...this is not quiche! It's scrambled eggs in a muffin tin...and good luck getting these out of even a non-stick pan...

I did not care for this recipe.  The actual egg portion of the quiche is good (although I have made better using sour cream and mayo along with milk making a creamier consistency).  But the bread on the bottom is thick and odd tasting with a quiche.  You'd be better off using phyllo or pie crust.

This came out beautiful - I tweaked it a quite a bit.... I added 1 package of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed out), I used 3 instead of 4 eggs and skim milk for the milk. I also used low carb wraps instead of the bread. i just cut the wraps (which were rectangular shape) into 4 squares each and placed those into the muffin tins. I baked as called for and sprinkled some extra shredded cheese on top of the mini  quiches for the last 2 minutes of baking - so they would come out bubbly and not burnt. This was delicious and the kids loved it!

Made this for breakfast and was  very nice change. I used the jumbo muffin cups, and only made 6 quiche. Using a three" biscuit cutter I cut the bread in the center; saving the bread to make Eggs in a Hole. A two" biscuit cutter would work for regular muffin pan. I used Pam, and ran a knife around the edge when I took them out of the oven. Used a tablespoon to remove them from the pan; no sticking. So good; so easy I will be making these again.

Great brunch idea--and very easy to customize to individual tastes/dietary needs. In some, I followed the recipe exactly but also added chopped deli ham; in others, to make them a bit lighter, I used chopped deli turkey, Egg Beaters, and fat-free cheese. They all turned out great--even the lighter ones were a hit. (Note: Make sure you spray the pan liberally or clean up is a little challenging.)

so easy and tastes great. Very fun because you can add anything to make it your own. I am definately going to make this again. Next time with pie crust instead of bread just to see if it is better. I used pam and buttered bottom of bread. Cut around edge and used a large spoon to remove from pan. I had no problem, they came out easy.

This was pretty good. I made some changes so that it wouldn't be bland. I added salt to the egg mixture and I quadrupled the cheese. I also added chopped hard salami and I topped it with chopped green onions. This made it very tasty! I also liked Cindylou's idea of using a knife to loosen the quiches from the pan and then using a spoon to help remove them. I didn't have a problem with sogginess. Maybe it was because after grating the onions, I squeezed out the excess liquid. I also increased the cooking time about 10 minutes.

Very dissapointed in this recipie.  Easy to make, but they bake down to nearly nothing and they're not filling at all.  I personally wouldn't make them again.

This is a decent base recipe, but it needs spices and other ingredients added to make it better than 3 stars. I put salt and minced garlic in the egg mixture (I used egg whites), and added sliced turkey. It is an easy and fast recipe though, and you probably have everything on hand to make it!

So cute!  This recipe is so easy to add any items you might want in your mini quiches!  I didn't care for the bread part it was a little strange tasting to me but I think with pie crust it would be perfect!  Give it a little more quiche taste!  My husband loved them with the bread so I guess its just a personal preference.

I thought crescent rolls would do better than bread.  I used 10 crescents and 2 shaped and trimmed slices of bread.  I'm so happy I only used to slices of bread because yuck!!  The recipe was a bit "eggy" for my taste, but the rolls def helped make it edible.

Having never had quiche, I don't have anything to compare this to, but I thought that they were wonderful!  I did need to add some salt to the egg or they were bland.  Didn't have any dry mustard so I just some regular prepared mustard.  I scale this to 6 and make them for a snack all the time.  Very easy to make.

Good Flavor, but stuck to the pan even after buttering generously. Not something I would share with guests. Next time I will try with pie crust as other reviewers have suggested.

Of course, I made some changes, but it was really good. SUBSTITUTIONS: *I added broccoli,  *used cheddar vs. swiss, and  *used a small flattened ball of flattened croissant dough vs. bread (I was already using it for something else and had some left over).  *I also didn't have dry mustard, so I used (don't laugh) a tsp of honey mustard.   Got rave reviews at church and three people asked for the recipe. Good  vegetarian breakfast dish :)

I made pie crust and took lil chunks and spread them into a muffin pan. I used sharp white cheddar and 1/8 cup minced (dried) onions instead.

These were good, but I don't think I'll make them again. Instead of Swiss cheese, I used Harvarti that could have made the difference. It is worth trying and fun making.

I would rate this a 0 if possible.  It was VERY bland.  I ended up throwing the whole batch out and rushing to the grocery store for frozen mini quiches!

We used this recipe with the following changes: small circles of puff pastry instead of the bread, spring onions instead of regular, grated matured cheddar cheese(tasty) instead of Swiss.  They tasted fantastic and went soooo fast at the luncheon we took them to.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

These were OK, warm, but nothing fabulous.  I too had trouble getting them out of the pan (though clean-up wasn't that hard), and they were a tad soggy and bottoms not as crisp as I would like.  I didn't like the onion flavor in this.

I made this recipe and thought the idea was better than the result. However i do think it's lovely with a little bisuit on top, or pre-made pie shells. If bread is all you have I think pressing the bread first helps. It brought out my creative side and enjoyed suiting a new recipe to my taste. Thanks for giving it to me!

This is a 'can't go wrong' recipe!  I have a family of 7 and EVERYONE loved it.  My 13 yr.old son said I could make this any time! I added crab to a few of them and some left-over smoked turkey from Christmas dinner to some more.  What a winner!

This was a pretty good "go to" recipe for a mini quiche. I personalized it to my liking. An interesting twist I decided to do was instead of bread, I fried up some potatoes (hash browns) and placed in the bottom, then proceeded to follow the original recipe. Instead of mustard, i used ranch dressing. I turned out  to be AMAZING!!

I first made these for my 2012 Holiday party - they were a hit!  
I even remade them on Christmas morning because they were so yummy and easy.
Now I make them all of the time - for picnics, for a quick breakfast on school days (the night before) -- love these!

This is a great recipe for a girl on the go like me. I make a bunch, freeze some, and grab them on my way out the door. (Call me strange, but I like them cold). Sometimes I use chopped broccoli instead of the onion.

Total disaster. Completely soggy. Was supposed to take these to a dinner party as an appetizer. Thank goodness I had a backup in the freezer. The cooking time is too short, there is too much milk. They were inedible.

1) onions need to be sauteed first.  The recipe as-is, which was what I tried, had an awful raw onion taste that didn't go away in the baking process.
2) Too runny.  The quiches looked nice in the oven but once taken out they collapsed into thin little misshapen things.
3) Stuck to muffin tin.  Use Pam or something to prevent sticking.  I only used vegetable oil and it didn't prevent sticking at all.

The bread crust got soggy, and the filling was bland. Next time I'll try this with phyllo dough and add some garlic salt to jazz it up a bit. It's a recipe worth playing with to get it right.

My husband absolutely adored this!  However, instead of swiss cheese I used cheddar.

This is a great recipe for parents!  My one year old loves them and they were so easy to pop into the microwave for a few seconds.  I gave it four stars because I changed a few things.. added lots of sausage which gave it really good flavor.

Super yummy.  A little soggy on the bottom, but I think it was my fault because I ran out of egg mixture after nine cups and had to make more using another egg.  I should have used less.  OOPS.

I decided to make these for something different for lunch for my boys (3 plus my nephew is here right now).  All in all, I would say they were so so.  I sprayed my muffin tins extremely well and buttered my bread circles and they still stuck horribly, plus the bread stayed a bit mushy in parts.  Not a waste, just not a repeat, but love the idea!

The recipe itself tasted good. I did add some garlic powder,real bacon bits, diced onion and shredded cheddar cheese. However, they stuck to the pan! Horribly! I greased the muffin tins but they still stuck.

I made this for the first time today and it disappeared in 10 minutes! It was absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was instead of onion, I used a little bit of deli ham. It added a lot of flavor and was a huge hit. Very easy to make and I can see it being a family favorite!!

Brush the bread circles with olive oil and bake for about 7 minutes, depends on oven but color should be medium brown.  Also added a bit of garlic powder to the egg.  A nice base recipe but needs imagination.  Am going to add diced jalapenos next time or maybe green chili peppers.

I followed the directions exactly... but honestly was totally unimpressed with the results. Not much flavor, and soggy after cooking 5 minutes longer then the directions indicated. I won't be making this recipe again.

So so easy.  What a great idea!  I used whole grain bread, baby spinach, red pepper and parmesan cheese.  I recommend spraying the muffin cups with cooking spray and be sure to use plenty of salt and black pepper.  Delicious!!

This was easy and good, as promised! I used a cup the make the bread circles, which made it really quick. The bread was a little thick for me, so I might pound it flat beforehand next time. Otherwise, delicious and I'm looking forward to mixing up the ingrediants I fill it with!

Turns out well. Instead of cutting the bread into circles, I cubed it, and mixed throughout the egg mixture. Not a fan of onions, so I used diced red peppers, spinach, and a little ham. Delicious!

Great! Turned out to be so easy and I added a few other things like bacon and mushrooms, and parmigiana cheese. Also I mixed half  heavy cream with the milk serving. It was fun to do with friends !

I made this as directed, and also tried tweaking it in subsequent versions to get something more pleasant to look at.  While they tasted fine, they fall quite a bit (a larger proportion of milk to eggs helps that some, but prevents the bread from forming a nice crust).  I just didn't think this recipe was worth making again because while the taste was fine, they just weren't appealing to the eye.

I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was a hit. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions though and added my own personal preference: I used Pillsburry biscuit dough as a base.I divided 1 raw biscuit dough into 3 and placed and molded it at the bottom of the tins (3 tins per 1 biscuit dough) 1 tube of raw Pillburry dough is more than enough for 12 muffin tins ( I used medium size tins).  I added 1 more egg in the mixture and added green onions, salt and more pepper. For the meat, I used maple sausage and precooked it and let it cool down. After I shredded the onions. I placed it in a paper towel to remove extra juice but I didnt squeeze it.  Then I followed the rest of the instructions. It was really good! I had left over the following day and placed them again the oven for 300F and it was delicious! So tasty! Will make this again!

Easy, quick and delicious. I made the following tweaks: instead of chopped onion I used onion powder, didn't use mustard, used cheddar jack instead of parmesan and used biscuits instead of bread. Turned out pretty good. The real judge will be my kids.

5.26.16   Use a cookie cutter for the bread, and you’ll find out just how quick and easy this recipe is.  I used a 1-7/8” round cookie cutter from a set and got three rounds per slice of bread, the perfect size for the muffin cup.  I think this is a basic recipe where you add additional ingredients to more or less “make it your own."  I wanted something with a little Mexican flair, so I used Mexican 4-Cheese Blend cheese, added chopped red bell pepper and cilantro, a sprinkle of some taco seasoning, and a shot of Sriracha®.  Tasted good, my only disappointment was that once out of the oven, the quiches deflated quickly, like a soufflé??  I scaled the recipe down to six, and that’s exactly what I got.  I'd give this 5 stars for taste, but only 4 based on eye appeal.

I loved this recipe for cooking with a kid. My 3 year old cut the bread circles with a cookie cutter. She cut the cheese with a blunt cheese knife. She got to mix the eggs and fill the muffin tins.  The recipe tastes good and is adaptable to many favors, but for my purposes, the most important thing is that we did it together.

I think this recipe is great - easy, can throw in other leftovers, etc. I added broccoli and a bit of cheddar cheese. I did use puff pastry instead of bread, an idea I read on another review. That was not a good substitution -- the bottom of each mini-quiche is soggy, the dough didn't bake. I even put it back in the over on the bottom shelf for 10 minutes. I think maybe the puff pastry should have been pre-baked, as the mix is so moist. Not sure - this is what I've gathered from researching the web a bit. Will try it again. Any successes with puff pastry as crust, and if so, what was your method?

Great recipe, but I make mine using a store bought biscuit (or crescent roll) crust rolled into a baking pan.  Once cooled, cut into small square pieces.  Make with ham, swiss, red peppers and/or anything other ingredients that float your boat!

This is truly easy and comes out looking impressive. I used 1 tsp regular Dijon mustard instead of dry mustard and it could have done with 2 tsp but I was concerned about over flavoring it. I also won't waste bread so I just cut three slices into 12 squares, rolled them with a rolling pin and stuffed them down into the muffin tin - it worked fine as the crust. 

I had to make double the egg mixture (8 eggs, 2 cups milk) to fill all 12 cups. I added chopped ham on top for flair and some added flavor. Husband liked it! 

Easy to freeze and reheat for a quick but fancy weekday breakfast. All in all - an easy delicious recipe.

My family LOVED these!  I did add chopped ham to the recipe and a little onion powder.  Great!

I love this as a base recipe.  I did make a few changes. Being on a low carb kick, I used 12 ham slices as the cup to hold the egg mixture.  Also added sauted leek to the base.  Great canvas for lots of flavors.

Used this as a base for my first ever quiche. 
Used sourdough as the bread, put in chicken, onion, broccoli, red bell pepper and a few slices of mushrooms before smothering in sharp cheddar. I made 24 little "quickies" and had to tweek the milk (2c) and eggs (6) to make enough. The bottoms were a little soggy but my oven sucks so they're sitting in the oven to stiffen up a bit.
Will for sure be a consistant meal in this house!

It's pretty easy! On the other hand next time I will saute the onion and add some green peppers to eliminate the eggy smell. 

I have also tried a version with sauted minced meat and shredded cheddar cheese. I liked it more.

I rated this recipe 2 stars for a few reasons. Everything was going fine up until I poured the egg mixture into the cups. Two things happened: the bread pieces floated up into the mixture, and I ran out of egg mixture 9 cups into the tin of 12. I quickly mixed up some more and put them into the oven. There was nothing I could do to get the bread to go back to the bottom of the muffin cups. It cooked as expected, the egg puffed up and then deflated while cooling. Even though I used ample cooking spray, the egg still stuck to the sides of the muffin tin. The result was an OK tasting egg dish. The bread had become unrecognizable as part of the egg, and made it taste slightly of very egg-y french toast. I would not make this recipe again.

Really good.  We like breakfast for dinner so quiche is a good choice and I can personalize.  I used Johnsonville breakfast sausage cut into small rounds for the sausage lovers in the family.  Everyone wanted seconds.

Made these and thought they were good but not great.  I think 5 eggs would have filled the muffin cups better.   I think it's really more of a cute presentation but not all that practical.   May serve them for book club for the presentation alone.  I too added a little meat and scallions.

I made these in my mini muffin tins - one a dark non-stick and the other a regular tin.  I rolled out each slice of bread, buttered it, and cut 4 circles - these were big enough to fit in the bottom and up the sides of each cup, butter side down.  For the filling I diced one slice of turkey bacon and some onion and sauteed them until the bacon was starting to brown.  I finely diced some gouda cheese and divided the cheese and onion/bacon mixture between the cups.  I made half of the egg/milk mixture and that was just enough for 24 mini quiches.  Once you have filled them, you'll need to go back and top them off as the bread will absorb a lot of the egg mixture.  These all tasted pretty good, but I discovered you should also grease the regular muffin tin as it was hard to get them out at the end. I would make these again.

Excellent and super easy!   I used shredded cheddar as we do not like Swiss and I added sweated, diced Vidalia  as I was too lazy to grate the onion.  I used old asiago cheese bread as I did not have enough loaf style.  I did both standard cupcake style, that my family ate for dinner with a green salad, and the 24 super mini, picture enclosed, for a party I had that evening.  The one recipe made enough for both and the bite size mini quiches were a huge hit.  I will make this quite often.  A definite keeper.

Very good base recipe. I was voting on pictures and had to stop and make this. :-) I added a can of chopped clams (drained) and used Italian bread crumbs with melted butter pressed into bottom of muffin cups in place of bread.  Didn't have any mustard so used a little lemon pepper.  Too lazy to chop or grate onion so used dried onion flakes and some garlic powder. :-)  Also cut recipe in half with 2 eggs, a splash of milk. Along with cheese and chopped cherry tomatoes. Sprinkled some cheese on top after removing from oven. Next time I will use bread and maybe some bacon.  Thanks for a great lunch!

Very easy. Mine did not stick. When you crave quiche, it is a quick fix. But IMO, I wouldn't serve them to others. Cute, yummy, easy. I will stick to my regular pie size quiche for an entertaining recipe.

This recipe was pretty good. A friend and I made it, but it turned out a little tastless. It could use some sharp cheddar instead of swiss. But other than that, it was good!

These were ok but nothing spectacular - a little bit bland, a little bit soggy. I was going to make them as Husband's contribution for an office party, but I didn't think they were quite good enough. I much prefer the 'Bacon and Tomato Cups' which, I might add, were a big hit. Thanks anyway.

I was going to make a quiche but was looking for a way to do individual servings for a caregiver.  I adjusted the recipe with what I had on hand.  Thank you so much.  This is a great way to control portions.

A great idea and a decent recipe, though I won't make them again too soon.  I ignored the "lightly grease" part and greased well and I still had a difficult time removing the quiches and pan was messy and difficult to clean.  Add bacon or ham for better flavor, too.
