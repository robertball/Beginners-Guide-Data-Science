Excellent.  I've been making my own croutons from day-old bread for awhile. When I see a loaf of sourdough on the mark-down shelf, I bring it home and make croutons. Seasonings here are spot-on.  And...butter is best but I sometimes use half butter and half olive oil to cut the cholesterol.

Love this great recipe!  Only problem I had was how much is 6 slices bread?  Size of bread varies, as well as size of slice.  But it didn't stop me from making these wonderful croutons.

Will never buy store-bought croutons again. This was so easy and scrumptious. Can’t wait to play around and test different seasonings.

Delicious, quick and easy. I’ve been experimenting with sourdough and always have leftover bread. This is a great recipe and a perfect way to use up that bread!

I have wanted to make homemade croutons forever and finally did thanks to this easy recipe!  Mine were done in about 10 mins so I would recommend keeping a close eye on them.  I thought the amount of seasoning was perfect however I think I will do less butter and more olive oil next time due to personal preference.  I don't think I'll be buying store bought anymore!

I would use just a smidgen less on the Italian seasoning.  Easy to make and so yummy.

Don't get me wrong, they are fantastic with great crunch and lots of flavor. Everyone in my huge family has been eating them without the salad. Lol. They are eating them like potato chips. The only complaint from everyone was the sodium. They are saltier than our family usually eats. Otherwise totally delicious. Thanks for the great recipe
