Yummy-Creamy-Quick and Easy! Made me wish I had some coconut on hand to toss into the filling! Note* Could easily have made two pies. Had a bunch left over to eat straight from the mixing bowl!

This recipe is just delicious!!  Next time I will use a bigger pie shell a 10 inch, I couldn't quite get it all in the one I had.  Or to get it to fit better in the  9 inch I will use a smaller can of pineapple.  So creamy, gone in seconds!

Very good, I added 4 oz cream cheese and this made it creamer and firmer.  Very tasty.

A family favorite, ingredients usually on hand, easy to prepare. Can use Splenda sweetened pineapple to reduce some calories but be careful with substituting all fat free ingredients, will leave the pie to soft to hold a firm slice.

YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. If you can read and follow simple directions, you can make this pie. I'm going to let my 9 year old granddaughter try her hand at it the next time we have it.

I made this recipe exactly like it says and it came out so good.  The recipe makes enough to fill 2 pie crusts though.  The pie tastes even better the next day.

Excellent - I made sure to drain the pineapple and the pie was still great 2 days later.  The recipe will fill a 9" pie shell with a bit left over.  Definitely a keeper!

I added 4 oz of cream cheese to this and I am glad I did.  I do not see how this would set up without something a little thicker in the mix.  I ended up freezing it to get it thick enough to hold together.  The flavor was wonderful though.

It tasted ok, was a little too sweet for me and it came out real runny for me even after chilling for several hours and draining the pineapple before adding.  Not sure if I will try this one again.

My whole family did not care for this recipe. It had a slightly bitter taste, and an awful texture.

A very good (not quite GREAT!),quick-to-fix dessert that needs to sit at least 2 hours before you cut it.

This pie is wonderful. It's easy to make and everyone loves it.  The only change I make is whipping the cream instead of using frozen. It has fast become a family favorite.

I had read some of the reviews before making this and heeded the advice about using a 10 inch pie shell.  The one change I made was use some chopped mandarin oranges in place of about a third of the pineapple.  I also topped it with coconut.  Just because I really love coconut.  It was delicious while being fairly light.  It was gone in just a couple days.  I will make it again.

So simple to make and enjoyed by everyone. 
I think the pineapple needs to be more than just drained. I squeezed out some of the liquid and it turned out great.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't great - just okay.  I would probably use more pineapple next time to give more flavor and texture.
