We enjoyed this dish. I used poblano pepper because I like it better than bell pepper. I would consider adding some more heat next time, maybe some red pepper flakes or harissa, to offset some of the sweetness of the dish.

It was great, made a few changes due to not liking bell peppers and peanut butter. The rest stayed the same, my hubby loved it too.

Delish! I used dates instead of raisins. Wish I hadn't added the peanut butter though, that was a bizarre non-Moroccan flavor.

Very tasty!  I really loved the flavors in this stew.  I used chicken broth because that's what I had on hand and fresh tomato instead of canned.  I'm not sure why the description mentions the crunch of peanuts since there is only peanut butter in this, but I'm sure crunchy peanut butter or a topping of crushed peanuts would be good too.
Update: This is even better the next day!!
