My Nana's been making these since I was a little girl and they're great! Love them with a cup of tea or coffee. Nice change from the usual sweet cookie. Don't let the mincemeat scare you!

The best mincemeat cookie there is. This is more or less the original NoneSuch Mincemeat Prize cookies. (only difference is the original called for 3 1/4 cups sifted flour - which would equal out to 3 cups non-sifted as in this recipe). Unfortunately it is becoming harder and harder to find the NoneSuch condensed 9oz brick of mincemeat. (time for a letter writing campaign I guess) substituting the jar mincemeat just doesn't come out very well.

My grandmother used to make a cookie at Christmastime that I just loved. As I grew older I asked her for the recipe but she said it was a family recipe and when I got married she would give me the recipe. Time went by and I never did get the recipe. Fast forward; I saw this box of Nun-such dried fruit with a cookie recipe on the side. It looked interesting so I made them. And behold - my grandmothers recipe. I make these cookies every Christmas season and it brings back memories of grandma and the wonderful family traditions that we have today. I love this recipe all the more because it s getting harder to find the box of mincemeat to make them.

This recipe is similar to our family recipe. I have a note penciled in on my copy that 2 cups canned mincemeat and 1/c flour is equivalent to the condensed mincemeat.
