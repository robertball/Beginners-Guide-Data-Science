This stuff is oh so good and great on fresh bagels!  I used all fresh chives and omitted the dry plus added a little garlic. I also used light cream cheese. I just love greek yogurt and this was a great way to get more into my diet.

I did not use the dried chives and I increased the onion powder to a full teaspoon. I also added about four cloves minced garlic (after I taste tested) and I used reduced fat cream cheese. Quite good, though I might increase both the onions and fresh chives next time. I plan on using this in The Best Mashed Potatoes for Thanksgiving.

This was so delicious! We had it on toasted English muffins. I omitted the dried chives as I didn't have any (and anyway, why bother when you can use fresh?), and also, because I couldn't find Greek yogurt, I simply spooned regular yogurt into a coffee filter, and let the moisture drip away. This leaves the yogurt thick and creamy, and not too unlike the Greek stuff. Next time I might add a little finely-minced red onion instead of green. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I thought this was an excellent combination, a little healthier than straight cream cheese and tasted great!  I did add smoked salmon to the mixture and used fresh rosemary instead of chives.  There is a plethora of ingredients that would be great in it.

This is delicious and easy. Used whipped chive flavored cream cheese instead of fresh chives, regular plain yogurt, and added some cucumber since I was going for a Greek type appetizer, and served w/pita bread.  Will make again!

YUM!!! This was so light and creamy and not overpowering with onion.  I really hate to rate a recipe that I have made many changes to, but I didn't have chives and when I looked for my onion powder I realized I was out.  I substituted 1/2 tsp. Adobo seasoning and didn't bother getting chives and it was a HUGE hit at our BBQ yesterday.  I served it with Triscuits and many people asked for the recipe.

Have you ever heard of HOVAN.  They are in malls and make the best wrap of sorts.  I used this on a tortilla, added meat and romaine lettuce, rolled it up, then cut it up in serving size pinwheels.  My kids love it and is great for lunchboxes. I didn't have the yogurt but otherwise made as written.

This spread is great and the possibilities are endless!  I used fresh chives the first time around and have also made it using green garlic and sage.  I really think the key to this spread is buying the greek yogurt - plain yogurt would definitely not be the same.

I added additional seasonings and used it on triscuits. Very good with chopped tomatoes and cucumber on top.

I have fresh chives this in my garden so I doubled the chives and omitted the dried chives and it was wonderful.

SUPER easy to make, I just toss all the ingredients in my Ninja.  And it is always a huge hit as an appetizer at any type of event/party. Super creamy, just the right amount of onion, and people can't stop eating it.  So glad I came across this recipe!
