WOW! This was a great dinner! A nice change as another poster said! I couldn't find the frozen veggies, so I just cut up a fresh green bell pepper and a yellow onion.  The sweetness in the onion was a great added flavor.  I also drained the corn...as I just figured I was supposed to.  I personally like my potatoes to be browned so I also cooked the dish a little longer. I cut everything up early and it was a breeze to throw it all together!

Wow!  My husband and daughter loved this meal.  The potatoes and sausage were too much for a large pan.  Had to cook this in a pot, so the cook time to get potatoes to "nearly tender" was much more than 10 minutes.  But it was so worth it!

This was pretty good, something different. My 2 year old ate everything on his plate, so it is for sure worth 5 stars! I used my veggie chopper to chop everything, even the sausage. I used fresh yellow onion and green pepper. Put the potatoes and onions in a big pot first so they could cook longer, chopped green pepper and sausage in the meantime. Added drained can of corn and salt, garlic,  and chili powder. Let everything cook covered for 20 minutes, stirring once in a while.

This was really very good. I wasn't sure at first. I made a double batch since we have a very large family. I needed to cook it in batches though because otherwise it stayed to moist. You really need to let this cook until most of the jusices dry out and you get those crispy parts. I used frsh pepper and onions and also steamfresh corn. Left out the red pepper flakes due to sensitive taste buds and used paprika and a little chili powder in place. Like I said, I wasn't too sure about it, but it grew on me and I found myself going back and picking at it! That's a 5 star in my book. All of my children loved it and so did hubby. He said he could have easily eaten the rest. ;)

My family liked this recipe very much. I have made it twice. The second time I used fresh bell pepper and onion rather than frozen and the result was much superior. I won't use the frozen pepper mix again.

Wow!  Quick, easy, cheap, and delicious.  I used Turkey Smoked Sausage and a bag of frozen "Western" vegetables (red pepper, green pepper, corn & onions) to make it one step even easier.  I cooked the batch in two large skillets to brown things easier and keep it from being too moist.  Other than that, followed the recipe and it was great.  Over easy egg on top really finishes it perfectly.

I made this today...eating it right now as a matter of fact, and it is fabulous!  Easy, inexpensive and tasty!  I have made variations of hashes in the past but I think this one is the best.  I did make some changes to the recipe though.  I used fresh onions and peppers rather than frozen, and I added mushrooms and 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  I cooked the potatoes by themselves for about 15 minutes before I added everything else.  In my other variations of hash I used to add eggs to the mixture itself, but this way was much better.  Rather than dirty up another pan, however, I just transferred the hash to a serving dish and cooked the eggs in the same pan. Absolutely wonderful! Thank you!

We've made this a few times, different variations (kielbasa vs. bratwurst, with/without eggs, etc.) and it's always good.  True story: when I recently had a week off from work, my husband requested I make three dishes -- steak salad, lasagna, and this.  I find the red pepper flakes are a key ingredient.

I'd have given this recipe five stars even without my additions to it.  As a cook, I know this works just as it is.  There are two things that a person does with food when they are poor and have relatively no money....the first is to buy things that are cheap, the second is to get mileage on them.  One of the great things about his recipe is it can do both.  And in keeping with the spirit of the recipe I added leftover onions, bacon, and olives.  The recipe didn't say whether or not the corn was to be drained first, and I did that because I wanted more of a 'pan fried' drier consistency to it rather than a soupy consistency. I also only used 1 TBSP of oil (and only for the potatoes).  Next time I'm going to add bell peppers, and instead of plain red-pepper flakes...I'm going to use smoked red-pepper flakes.  This is a wonderfully versatile recipe.  Options I have already thought of include scrambling the eggs, tossing them in and doing a 'pan fried' version of a tortilla wrap...and it can always go in between two slices of toasted sourdough bread.  This is a really great recipe and it is going into my recipe box for keeps.

Better than I thought it would be.  I needed to use up some potatoes and had some smoked turkey sausage, so I gave it a go.  used fresh bell peppers. Don't skip the eggs! they make the dish!  The kids loved it and all wanted more as long as they could get another egg with it...

Good recipe, but I suggest halving the recipe and omitting the red pepper flakes because they make it pretty spicy.  I'll make it again, but with some changes.  Possibly will change the vegetables too.  Too many vegetables made the potatoes not cook all the way through.

I used fresh onions and peppers, cut the potatoes down to 2 and added 8 oz of cabbage and carrots (the pre packaged cole slaw sold in the salad section of the supermarket).  Seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, and a sprinkle of paprika.  Perfect!

I couldn't find the stif fry mix anywhere so I ended up using one fresh red pepper and 1 medium size yellow onion.  These turned out really well and yummy.  I did end up with a lot of left overs (I think it will serve 8 people depending on the portion size) so we will have some for lunch tomorrow as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used frozen potatoes O'Brien mix with onions & peppers and frozen corn which made the prep super fast. Only needed to chop the kielbasa and add spices. The corn added a sweet touch which balanced the flavor a nicely. Thanks for sharing - it's a keeper!

Although my husband said "eh", I really enjoyed this. I was using only what I had on hand and didn't have any frozen veggies, but I did have a can of sweet corn. I also left out the red pepper flakes. The sweet flavor of the corn was a great complement to the tangy kielbasa, and the eggs were a great finish. Had lots of leftovers too. Economical, easy and so yummy!

I've made this several times now, but always with a couple changes. First, I always stick the chopped potatoes in the microwave for 3 minutes or so before adding to the pan. This helps with the "everything's done but the potatoes" problem. Fresh onion and peppers are a must. I add the onion, potato, and sausage, let that cook for a couple minutes, then add the peppers and corn so they don't overcook and get mushy. The egg really takes this dish to the next level - don't skip it! I usually just fry the eggs in the same pan to save on dishes. Excellent comfort food and super easy to make, perfect after a trying day at work.

Made this tonight. it was a big hit with the adults and kids alike. I added some fresh mushrooms to the onions and peppers and used fresh vs. frozen. I also added a little bit of garlic powder when cooking the veggies. I cooked everything in batches and then combined and cooked it a bit longer as I didn't want to crowd the pan. Two thumbs up!

I made this with a pound of pork sausage today because that's what I had on hand, but I've made it with kielbasa too and both are yummy.  It's especially good with the fried egg on top.  I served it with a piece of garlic toast to sop up all of the yumminess.

Great, quick dinner! I did end up serving it with basted eggs & toast. I also used fresh peppers & onions rather than frozen but frozen corn rather than canned:) Had leftovers for breakfast the next day.

It wasn't a bad recipe, but it seemed so mushy. I cooked it the proper amount of time and everything, but with all the food that's in the pan (and I used my largest pan) it came out quite soft, especially because of the frozen peppers. It was also rather spicy. I was worried that there wouldn't be any kick to it, but I was wrong. I don't think I'd make it again, but it was enjoyable.

This was great. My husaband and picky kids all loved it, which is rare. The only change I made was to use frozen corn, which I think has a much fresher flavor. Even when I heated it up at work they were lining up for the recipe without even tasting it! This is definate keeper. My only warning would be to make sure you use a big enough skillet, as this does make alot.

I had full intentions of following this recipe except for using fresh onion with red and green peppers. I had diced the potatoes and had them cooking in the oil when my mom came upsairs and asked what I was making. I told her kielbasa and corn hash, she said why not use the leftover corned beef she had brought home from a family gathering, and make corned beef hash!!! So that's what I did. I did forget to add the corn. I will make this again and follow the recipe and directions exactly!! Thank you for the great recipe.

This is a very tasty recipe. I used fresh red pepper and onion in this instead of frozen. I used a little seasoned salt along with the red pepper. This recipe is a keeper. I will make this again and again.

Very tasty! We will make this again. I skipped the corn, added some ricotta and spinach because I had it on hand. The potatoes take a while to cook, and I used fresh onion instead of the frozen. The eggs are the finishing touch!

Yummo!  My husband kept saying, "can we have this everyday?"....I added 2 sweet potatoes which added color and flavor.  I just used 1 med. onion and 1 green pepper vs. buying frozen...I will definately put this recipe in the "keeper" file.

Yum, yum, yum.  I used 1 each red, green, and yellow peppers and 1/2 onion instead of the frozen, and added 1 tsp each salt and pepper.  Gotta have the egg.  So yummy!

I too made this today...the day before payday!!  lol...that what drew my attention!  I only wanted to spend a lil cash and I bought the main ingredients for less than $8!  As others have said let it cook til all the juices are gone.  It gets super good at that point.  I doubled the red flakes and thought it could of used more.  I also added one of those generic spice blends as I wanted a lot of flavor.  I'll add more of that too next time.  This was really good though.

Wow -- delicious!!  Like other reviewers, I used fresh onion and red bell pepper and also added 3 stalks of celery to create the creole trinity.  I also added a bit more onion powder, seasoned salt and some cayenne instead of the crushed pepper flakes.  I diced the potatoes small and after cooking everything on the stovetop for abt 10 minutes, I added approximately 1/2 a cup of water simmered for a few more minutes and then covered and put in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  The potatoes ended up deliciously creamy.   do not skip the egg on top -- it takes the dish from great to off the charts!  my husband ate 2 giant bowls and asked me when I'm making it again.  thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe - I will be making again and again.

Really good and quick. This will go in our stash of go to recipes when we have no idea of what to make for dinner that night. Only thing I didn't have on hand was the frozen pepper and onion mix, so I just used fresh. Use the eggs, it is really what ties the dish together.

Delicious and simple.  I agreed with the reviews that suggested using fresh peppers and onions.  I didn't have any sogginess issues - perhaps due to using fresh vegetables?  The veggies and sausage gave it all a really yummy flavor and the egg on top was great.  This will definitely go into the rotation of family meals.  Great recipe, FoodieGeek!

The first time I made this for my family, their faces weren't convinced.  The first bite changed their minds!  This is definitely a staple, and we don't wait until the end of the month to make it!  I don't use the frozen corn w onions/peppers, I substitute fresh onion, green pepper, and whatever corn I have on hand - either canned or frozen.  This is sooo yummy, especially with the crushed red pepper.

We've made this recipe a lot! It's one recipe everyone in our family will agree on. We don't like bell peppers, but zucchini and yellow squash work great as substitutes for us.

First this recipe gets points for being so easy and filling, second it lends itself well to substitutions. I cooked the seasoned frozen hash brown potatoes to crispy first and removed them - then used the same pan to saute the sausage (Cheddar and Jalapeno flavor) with onions, adding some previously frozen summer corn and red and yellow chopped peppers (I'm not a big fan of green peppers). Another plus with this was that I could do it early in the day, refrigerate the sausage mixture in the pan, and when dinner hour rolled around I just added the potatoes back in while heating. Definitely the sunny side up eggs were a plus! We'll do this again - thanks so much for the recipe.

Extremely easy recipe!  Would be great for a first time cook to make.  Most of the work is in the prep so have everything chopped and ready to go in advance and you'll be good to go.  I diced two carrots as well while I put the kielbasa in first for a head start as I wanted it to brown up more.  It definitely needed to cook longer than the 10 minutes in order to brown, but was perfect as is.  So glad I found this super easy recipe.

I think this is the best recipe for someone who just threw it all together!  I used a broccoli/cauliflower/carrot frozen blend and used chili pepper instead of the red pepper flakes. I also added the fried eggs on top... this is the first time the boys actually went for seconds! They are picky 6 & 8 year old's.

this was very good but, i used fresh onion, bell pepper and frozen corn because it was cheaper and tastes way better. also used 2Tbsp canola to brown the kielbasa and potatoes and it still stuck to the bottom of my pan. used some  water to steam the caramelization off, make a gravy and hash. don't eat without a over-easy egg on top.

So I tried following this recipe, but ran into a few hiccups. First of all, I think I didn't chop the potatoes up fine enough. Because of this, it took them a very long time to soften. I added everything as stated, but when I realized the recipe was completed and my potatoes were still hard, I started adding milk and covering the whole thing so they would soften. The result was absolutely delicious! My roommate was stealing bowls of it while I wasn't looking!

Wonderful!  I cut the potatoes and kielbasa really small, and cooked each step about 15 minutes to get it extra brown.  Even my super-picky husband loved it!  This recipe is a keeper!

I would have just given this like a 3-4 on taste, but it had so much more going on. It was a beautiful dish with a lot of vibrant colors. It was cheap to make (less than 10 dollars for what I would call 6 generous servings). It was also low calorie when I substituted egg whites for the eggs and turkey kielbasa for the regular kielbasa. It was only 5 WW points per serving and left us feeling rather full.

Oh my! This is so good and easy! Perfect comfort food. I used garlic salt instead of plain salt and extra red pepper flakes because I love spicy food. I drained the can of corn also. My mouth is watering right now thinking about it. I think I will go warm up the leftovers....

Overall, this was a fantastic dish to work with.  We used fresh bell peppers and onion, which my boyfriend chopped up very small (not in strips) and which turned out to be just the right thing for the dish.  The potatoes were cooked just right and it was a pretty big success in general.    However, next time I am going to add a starch at the end, such as wild rice or cous cous, and I will chop up the kielbasa into more bite-sized pieces.

Ha! Love the title of the recipe because we've all been there at one time or another! This was great and the kids really enjoyed it too. Reminded me of a dish my mom made for us when we were kids. I did add in more seasonings but other than that, it was yum as is. To me the fried eggs or even poached are a must to make the dish special. Thank you so much!

THIS WAS AWSOME!!!!  5 stars all the way. I didnt use the eggs but instead I placed corn bread on a plate and coverd it with the Kielbasa and corn hash. I made this the day before we ate it cause I took it to a SD Chargers game and place it in foil trays and just heated it up on the grill. I had to triple the batch for the amount of people so I only used 3/4 of the corn and added another pound of Kielbasa, we like more meat in our dishes. I should have doubled the batch I already tripled cause i couldnt keep it on the table it was gobbled up so quick. Will be making this again and again in the future. So cheap to make and so many different variations you can do with this recipe so you can experiment for days. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Turned out great. Topped the hash with a slice of American cheese and an over medium egg. Kids loved it.

Easy, tasty and so nice to have all the ingredients on hand.  I decided to omit the corn and eggs as it already made ~6 servings.  I used 4 red potatoes and 1 sweet potato (a must!) and put them in ~10 minutes early to allow them to cook through.  I used 2 fresh bell peppers and 1 1/2 onions.    MMmmm!  This will become a staple!  :)

We loved this!  I just made a few modifications to make it easier.  Instead of cutting up potatoes, I used frozen Southern Style Hash Browns-less prep and less cooking time.  I thought the red pepper flakes might be too spicy for my kids, so I pulled out MAGIC Seasoning All-Purpose Blend, and it did the trick!  I also doubled the recipe and put the other half in a ziplock bag in the freezer.  Now I have a meal ready to go!

Really thought this would be a hit but no one liked the corn in it so will try it again without corn and a better grade of sausage--the kielbasa I used tasted too much like hot dog.

I used 1 fresh pepper and 2 small onions instead of frozen. I didnt have red pepper flakes but used some Chilli powder and cayenne and it worked great. The egg was a nice touch. I served it with some sauteed spinach. Very good!

I love making Kielbasa, usually with sauerkraut or beans and hot peppers over rice.  I came home yesterday and made this from memory using 2 fresh red bell peppers, an onion and frozen corn.  I had fresh thyme I needed to use and replaced red potatoes with russerts I had on hand.  Lots of ground pepper, hungarian paprika and some italian seasoning.  WOW!  This was a great alternative to my usual Kielbasa!  Quick easy and DELICIOUS.  I did not top with eggs, this was a meal in itself and a hit at my dinner table.  This will be a regular meal in my house.

I really did make this the day before payday! =) I used fresh green peppers and an onion. I also added sliced mushrooms.  I sauteed the onions and peppers before hand to get them a little softer. I added a little Franks Red Hot too for some heat and flavor. It did take a little longer for the potatoes to be soft (about 20 min). This was great, and easy, and I will make it again!

We loved this. The only change I made was to add some diced squash and red peppers, simply to add some more veggie content.

It's almost even better the next day, if any's left.

Fantastic recipe! Family loved it! I also did not have a  pan big enough, did it in a pot and covered for first 10 minutes. Helped it to get tender faster. I added chipotle sea salt, pepper and oregano. Can't wait to make it again!!

Wow! This is so delicious and so easy to make. My fiance added hot sauce to his to spice it up a bit, but I thought it was fine as is. I made my eggs sunny side up, and it was so tasty. It's great without the eggs too. Another plus is how inexpensive this meal is to make. Can't wait to make it again!

I started out knowing I wasn't going to follow the recipe exactly. I used fresh green bell peppers and onions instead of the frozen, finely diced. I added them to the potatoes and then, when they were mostly cooked, I added in the kielbasa. When the mixture was almost done, I tossed in about a cup and a half of frozen corn and let that cook for a bit. I added a sauce made of sriracha sauce, mushroom soy sauce, honey, water, and garlic and put a little of that in with the dish. We skipped the eggs this go around, though next time I plan on using them. This is a great base recipe and I will definitely be using it to experiment again.

I used leftover corn, frozen O'Brien potatoes, turkey kielbasa, cooking spray instead of oil, and added some frozen cut green beans. The whole family loved it, including my 4 year old granddaughter. One I will be making again.

This was fabulous!  I left out the peppers, since I don't like peppers.  I added a little chili powder and garlic powder, per other rater's suggestion.  Super!

Love this! It's delicious, easy, and inexpensive. My daughter even loves it and she's a picky eater. Adding a bit of hot sauce makes it even better.

Fresh and easy dinner! I scrambled my eggs in with the kielbasa and potato mix so it was easier to reheat later. The taste was a little plan so I added fresh garlic and other spices to taste but after that it was wonderful!

My mom just tried this recipe tonight (10/21/14), it was pretty good! She didn't put the egg on top, but it still good. She substituted green peppers and onion in place of the stir fry and used a Southwestern style corn.

This was a great, fun dish to make ! I had everything in my pantry to make it, except for the eggs and I went to get them quick! I really enjoyed it. Wouldn't change a thing.

I also started making this dish many years ago when grocery money just didn't stretch from payday to payday.  Back then kielbasa was one of the cheapest meats you could buy and it was very tasty. Hamburger was 89 cents a lb and they hadn't told us yet arteries would clog from too much bacon fat. Gee...I'm old as dirt...lol  Anyway we still make this dish once every month or two for dinner. Only difference.  I use lean turkey kielbasa and we call it comfort food.

This recipe is very tasty as written and I suggest you try it exactly as written if you keep frozen onions and peppers on hand.  To me, it tastes so much better, and it's cheaper when you use fresh onions and red or green peppers.  Saute the onion until it starts to get a little transparent. Add the diced up potato and saute until the potatoes start to brown on the edges.  Now throw in the pepper so it doesn't get all soft and mushy from cooking too long.  Toss in the kielbasa and saute everything together until the meat is hot and fully cooked.  The potatoes should be a nice golden brown.  Now top with those yummy fried eggs and...oh my, how good.  

Bravo FoodieGeek...this was a wonderful comfort food recipe to post!!!  Your way or my way with the onions and peppers, it's sooo good.

delicious! in my recipe box already, had to brown the potatoes first, and then add the keibasa, I also used fresh peppers and onions and frozen corn and adjusted cooking times as such, but the recipe was a great inspiration and the eggs make it great. I did not use all that oil, as i poached the eggs, also used low fat turkey keibasa :)

This has become a family regular.  The entire family will eat this.  I don't dice the meat and potatoes as small as in the picture so it's a little more chunky but we like it that way.  It is definitely a keeper - it's filling, feeds alot of people and is easy and pretty cheap to make.  Usually have this stuff in my pantry so I have reached for it when I'm in a hurry and forgot to thaw something - Keilbasa thaws quickly under running water!

Great recipe!  The only change I made was using fresh onion and pepper i/o frozen.  This is quick and delicious.  The entire family really like it.  Thanks for the recipe.

this was way better then i thought it would be. my husband will not eat green peppers so i saute an onion. used russet potatoes as had no red. i kept skins on them. also had no whole corn so had to use cream corn. it worked well and i think it helped the potatoes finish cooking. topped it off with some shredded cheese. we did add the egg on top too. will defiantly make this again.

I used 1 cup frozen corn, 2 green bell peppers and 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion. Very good! (no egg)
