This bread is SUPER!!! I've made it several times, and it always comes out great. I use V-8 juice, as suggested, and add 1/2 cup chopped sundried tomatoes, 3 or 4 minced cloves of garlic, and 1 1/2 tsp dried basil. YUM!! I have a friend who begs me for a loaf of this every week. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This bread makes fabulous grilled cheese! I left out the yeast and used a little extra starter and had no problems. I wish I could give 6 stars =)

pretty darned good!
  It's a simple recipie that turns out nice, but I added a few extra bits to make it a little more interesting.  I mixed in some oregano, chopped sundried tomatoes, and diced pepper-jack cheese bits before the flour.  Plus, I used half wheat/half white flour, to make it more wholesome.  Delicious & very pretty color!  It was devoured & commended at the dinner party I attended!

This bread surprised me. I was expecting that I wouldn't like it because I hate V-8 juice. It's got an amazing chewy crunchy crust with a mild soft inner bread..it is fabulous. Next time, I'm going to try it with some cheese and herbs mixed in. I make bread several times a week and this one has jumped up near the top of my favorite list. Absolutely love it!

EXCELLENT recipe.  I added about 1/4 c chopped sun dried tomatoes to this, and will definitely do this again.  I also baked only one loaf and froze the second loaf.  The frozen loaf worked out fine--very much like buyign frozen bread.  I don't know if this made a difference, but some recipes call for rising in the refrigerator for 12+ hours before baking.  Due to my time constraints, I put the unfrozen loaf in the loaf pan and refrigerated for 24 hours before baking.  I let it rise on the counter for 2 hours before baking Texture was great and the flavor was awesome.

Wow!  Awesome recipe!  Thanks, Esther!  I've made this recipe twice and it definitely had a better flavor the second time when I used a more established sourdough starter.  I added about a tablespoon of italian seasoning to the dough and  about a 1/2 cup of sundried tomatoes, taking the suggestions of another reviewer.  In addition to that, I used the oil from the sundried tomatoes to grease the bowl and the top of the dough before letting it rise.  I make an herbed butter to go with the bread and it's delicious!  The best part for my husband and I were the grilled cheese sandwiches I made the second day.  Spread a little herbed butter on one side each of two slices of bread.  Make sandwiches using a couple of slices of pepperjack cheese.  Grill the sandwiches on the buttered sides until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melty.  The pepperjack cheese makes the flavors of the butter and the bread burst!  I'd like to serve it next time with a nice tomato soup.  My husband's mouth has been watering for more ever since!

This was a fantastic bread!  My starter isn't very strong so it didn't really taste very "sourdoughy" but I added 1 tsp of dried minced onion (next time I'll add 1 Tbsp), some italian seasoning and sundried tomatoes (don't forget to blanch in boiling water first if using dried) and it turned out wonderfully!

We loved this bread!  However, I would like to be able to make it with soymilk instead of V-8, but my attempt to substitute directly flopped.  Any suggestions?  Also, would it be possible to modify the recipe somehow to skip the commercial yeast and make it with just the starter?

I use sun-dried tomato paste from a tube to give it a stronger tomato flavor. Still its not very strong thats the only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star recipe. I want a tomato bread that can stand up to my pesto butter.

This is going to be my sourdough recipe from now on. This recipe makes bread that can be used not only for toast, but also sandwiches because it will not crumble on you after you slice it.  I love it!

I did not use any pacaged yeast; I only used the suggested amount of sourdough starter for leavening.  It took my dough 11 hours to raise the first time, and about 1.5 hours the second time.  The wait was well worth it, though!

This turned out very nicely. I only made half a recipe and did add in basil, garlic, and cheese as suggested by previous reviewers, but I think it would have been pretty good even without those additions. My husband said it tasted like "pizza in bread form."

Very tasty! I followed the instructions for the soft crust, and even though it came out rock hard, softened up wonderfully!   I also added 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, along with 4 slices of pepper jack cheese.  Will double those next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was tasty bread. I halved the recipe, used a little less than half whole wheat flour and I used bread flour for the rest. I also made this into sandwich rolls, which made for a nice sandwich!

Fabulous bread! I used whole wheat flour and salsa instead of tomato juice. It was absolutely wonderful and the salsa added a lot of neat texture and color bits. The bread was nice and crusty and very moist on the inside. Not a true "sourdough" bread because of the yeast, but a great bread none the less.

Ogerall a good recipe, but I think next time I will add herbs and maybe some cheese to up the flavor.  Also I think it should be baked at a higher temperature for a more flavorful crust.

Wow, very nice right out of the oven with butter.  I served with beef stew and it was perfect.  I did get 3 rather large boules out of this recipe so it could be cut in half and would be just right, at least for us.  As the previous reviewer said, I may add a bit more salt next time, and there will be a next time!

Don't try this as written in a standard bread machine!  It was too much flour and didn't mix properly.  I took it out and tried to do it by hand (I've never made bread by hand before ....).  It's now allegedly rising, so we'll see what happens!  I'm giving it 5 stars because it seems like a good bread according to other reviews.  I think sadlt that I've just messed it up with my experimenting.

I just took the loaves out of the oven and of course had to have a slice of it right away.  It has a nice tang from the sourdough with a hint of tomato taste.  I used my homemade "V-8" juice and added some Italian seasoning.  I can hardly wait to try it in sandwiches.  Another recipe,to add to my sourdough collection!
Update:  I make this every week to sell at farmers market.  I sell every loaf each week. Every one who has bought it loves it!  I do use my homemade spaghetti sauce that I can from my own tomatoes every year.  T

I needed to use up some of my starter, so I made this recipe twice today. Once with All Purpose flour and once with Bread Flour. The texture of the loaf with the bread flour was much better. It definately needs some other flavor. I will try it again using the sundried tomatoes and herbs next time. Also, instead of kneading it by hand I did it in my mixer with a dough hook. Overall I think it's a great recipe with a really good crumb.

The texture of this bread is fabulous and of course the sourdough flavor is going to be determined by how powerful your starter is going in.  The dough is easy to work with and I fully intend to make this bread again and again- with some changes.  First of all, the tomato flavor in this bread is definitely weak.  I'd like to use spicy V8 rather than tomato juice and I'll probably add some tomato paste for good measure.  I know many others used sun-dried tomatoes with good results, but I just don't like their flavor.  I might consider adding a small amount of onion powder and garlic powder, but not much because I'd really like to get that tomato flavor to shine.  Lastly next time I'll add an egg wash, I think it would be lovely on the crust.

Excellent recipe! Cut back on yeast by half and added sundried tomatoes and onion powder.  Stays moist for days unlike my usual sourdough recipe. Will definitely make again. And will experiment with using no commercial yeast. My starter is well aged and healthy and my goal is to not have to rely on commercial yeast at all.

We all absolutely loved this bread.  We toast it in the morning and add butter, it's wonderful!  Makes a great grilled cheese, too!  Making more today :)

We loved the bread, and it was easy to make, but I didn't like the crust at all, and I didn't over bake it.  I'm going to make it again once more.  The flavor of the bread though was wonderful and perfect amount of tomato flavor.  YUM!

This was missing something for me - it sounded great, and after reading some reviews, I added some rosemary and garlic, but it was still very bland.  I guess I was expecting more "zip", but we all we a little underwhelmed.

This was a good bread, though I couldn't really taste the tomato flavor.  I'll try mixing in some sundried tomatoes and see if that helps.  But otherwise, it was a very good bread!
