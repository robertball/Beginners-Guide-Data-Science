Wow! These are amazing. I prepared these for a wedding shower I was hosting -- they guys went crazy for these appetizers. I was looking to save money (and time) so I used rare roast beef sliced from my supermarket deli instead of the beef tenderloin.

I ate an entire sleeve of Ritz Crackers watching the 'Hawks win yesterday.  I'm buying another box and a 7lb tenderloin for the Superbowl.  GO HAWKS!

My hubby grunted and moaned over these little but yet hearty morsels. There was noting but nothing wrong or disliked about these. The creamed spinach was delish and I think I could make myself a huge bowl of that stuff, and the béarnaise was wonderful, I'd never made it before, ate it, but never made it and it was quite simple. I over did the steak a little but hubby likes it that way. And said it was just fine. These were perfect in every way. Will make again for sure. Making these earned me a huge kiss on the cheek and coffee served to me after dinner instead of me making it myself. What a reward! Thanks Doug.

I will be completely honest. I love my recipe concept. Personally I like a thicker chunk of steak on the cracker than what was approved for my recipe but that is really up to you. You can also use the heartier RITZ Crackers (wheat) as well. Remember, Bearnaise is harder to spell than it is to make.

I was hungry for lunch today.  I had leftover steak.  I had leftover Ritz crackers.  I had all the other ingredients listed.  I don't do cooked spinach, so I made a substitution of just using arugula.  When I got to the Béarnaise Sauce, I panicked when I saw TARRAGON in the instructions!  WHAT?!?  I subbed fresh thyme because that's all I had on hand.  But this is a yummy little munchy lunch for me today.  I'm not sharing it with anyone!  Thanks, Doug!

This recipe is the greatest idea since Ritz Crackers! It was a little too hoity-toity for me but the recipe and idea is brilliant.
I decided to use the it in a different way. I kept the steak but substituted grilled onions and american cheese for the Bearnaise and spinach and did a riff on a steakhouse-style Cheesesteak. I guess there's a reason this guy is an all-star....

My family liked these a lot.  The sauce complimented the beef and the spinach mix well.  We did find that our Ritz crackers got slightly soggy so I might try a more sturdy cracker next time.

Good job, Doug!  I followed your recipe exactly but I used sliced Porterhouse steak.  The Bearnaise sauce is perfect.  I did sort of gild the lily as it were, by using Ritz garlic butter flavor crackers.  The two ladies I shared these with we're skeptical at first but wildly enthusiastic after the first bite!  Thanks

What is better than Ritz Crackers, Steak, Creamed Spinach and Bearnaise Sauce, not much!  Great recipe.
