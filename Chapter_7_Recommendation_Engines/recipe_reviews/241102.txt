I tasted the marinade before I added the meat and veggies, and I knew this wouldn't fly with the family, or me.  I added about 4 tsp. Worcestershire and some salt, but the lime flavor was still too bright for me.  I chose to grill this recipe, and I'm glad I did, because the caramelization added some dimension to the flavor.

I wasn't expecting a stove-top fajitas to taste this good.. !
I used flank steak instead of skirt steak and marinated the sliced meat over night in a Ziploc bag.
I didn't marinate the onion and pepper slices because I wanted the veggies to stay crisp. I added some salt to the meat and veggies, right before taking them of the heat.
I served in tortillas with guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it was perfect. I only marinated for 30 minutes and it was just enough. I did add a little bit of garlic salt after cooking bc the steak needed just a bit  more flavor! This is a new staple in my family. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Perfect chicken fajitas!  The lime juice was not too strong at all.  We added some chopped pineapple at the end and had a fabulous meal.

This was excellent!! I didn’t have lime juice so just used lemon juice and increased spices a bit. I’ll never buy fajita spice mix again!! Yay!

This was a good recipe for fajitas. Along with steak, I used prawns and it turned out well too.

As a novice cook, this recipe is very user friendly and tasty to boot ?? A couple of things...
- I added a bit of garlic salt and pepper to the chicken before I marinated it. 
- I didn't marinate the peppers and onions with the chicken. Rather, I halved the ingredients for the marinade (including a bit of garlic salt), tossed it with the peppers and onions, and left it for about 20 minutes.
- Lastly, I like my food spicy, so I may add some ancho chili powder to the marinade next time.

Thanks for the yummy and healthy recipe!

This is wonderful...my only change is that I used all jalapenos and poblanos because we like it a little spicy!  Great recipe!

My kids (ages 5 &4) really enjoyed these but for them I omitted the jalapeño pepper in the marinade and added it to on top of my fajitas with fresh guacamole & pico de gallo. I seasoned the meat with salt & pepper prior to adding it to the marinade. I did not add the onion & peppers to the marinade because I was leery about the contamination from the meat. I cooked everything in a cast iron skillet, cooking the onions & peppers first until tender and softened then I added in the meat seering it on both sides. Delicious! Will definitely make again but I may add Worcestershire sauce to the marinade.
