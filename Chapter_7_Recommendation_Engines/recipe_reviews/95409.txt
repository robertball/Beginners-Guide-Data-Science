This was so easy and really tasty.  I made them for a holiday cookie contest at work and took home 2nd place...  not too shabby!  A little tip-  Make the chocolate mixture in the microwave on high for about 30 seconds, stir well-  saves time and dishes.

This recipe is similar to one my mother made for decades--we use orange juice, walnuts, and roll in regular sugar. Love them.

This was a great recipe, and I had a number of people ask me for the recipe and we're impressed with how simple they are to make.

So I am a skeptic, especially where AR is concerned- I read tons of reviews before trying a recipe. Made these 10 days ago, wondered if they would be as good as the reviews. Tasted the first one today, and these are simpy amazing!  I wish I'd made 3 x as much! I used Fiori di Sicilia from KAF- about 1/4 tsp. and 1 tsp vanilla. These things are simply amazing! Found some pretty gold metallic fancy sugar to roll in and they look like chocolate dusted with gold. Making more for New Year's TODAY!!! Don't wait to try these- they will be a new family favorite!
Edit:  After giving these on my Christmas cookie plates, the consensus is that it's better to roll them in plain cocoa than any sugar- cocoa deepens the flavor and the texture is better.
Still love these, just with cocoa not sprinkles or sugar!

I made these a few times for different holiday parties, they went fast!! I've learned to make double batches!! Had to hide them from the kids, even though they helped make them! I also used pecans, they're our favorites

This was my favorite as a child.  My mother, who as a young bride  in the 1950's, found it in a newspaper!  She would make Pomanders every year just for me. :-)  One variation from above is that she would crush the vanilla wafers until very fine. (She used a blender and crushed the cookies in small batches.)  The same was done with pecans.  Today I crush the ingredients as fine as I can with a food processor.  One final note, we rolled them in red or green colored sugar (red made them pomanders and the green for Christmas!)  They were stored in one tin for each color.  I now make them for grandnephews and nieces.  They don't expect smooth creamy "rum balls" but rather, those wonderful "textured" orange chocolate things!  They know they are POMANDERS!  Enjoy the tradition.

Oh these are our family's favorite Christmas treat!  My mother also found this recipe in the newspaper, I actually have the original cutout too.  We made them yearly without fail and now my children must have them yearly as well.  I crush the vanilla wafers & nuts in the food processor now, but we used to crush them with a rolling pin!  I have quadrupled the recipe I have so use 24 oz of Choc Chips and make a large batch.  We also roll in red and green sugar and alternate them in the tin - looks very festive.  I try to make them the week after Thanksgiving then they are all ready for Christmas. I was happy to see this posted here!

Good with several tweaks.  I measured carefully and followed the steps as written.  The result was a very dry and crumbly mixture that would not hold shape or sprinkles.  I added an additional 2/3 teaspoon or (pure) orange extract and multiple tablespoons of water, one at a time until the dough would hold shape.  The taste was good, and I will probably make them again with modifications described.

Sometimes naysayers have not made the recipe according to directions, they add this or that or make substitutions so the recipe turns out all wrong.
These are wonderful if the recipe is followed correctly.

Eh, I was not impressed. Flavors didn't appreciably improve after aging for nearly 2 weeks. Pretty much a waste of ingredients.

I used real orange extract and it was overpowering so i doubled the rest of the ingredients added vanilla, cocoa and more karo and some cinamon.  I just don't like the orange taste. It is like that chocolate you get in the box of chocolates that has orange cream when you would have rather had a caramel or a nut chocolate.  However, this was upon first test.  The  recipe says they are best after 2 weeks, so i will repost if the orange goes away.
