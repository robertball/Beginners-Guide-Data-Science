Hmmm, not sure how to rate this...I used wheat bread and did some w/ the provolone and some w/ American cheese (for my girls). They were good, and the girls loved them, but they were more work than they were worth, IMO. The cheese was too big for the bread, so that had to be trimmed, then, when you tried to roll it the bread would tear or the cream cheese would come out of the end I did not use a thick layer of cream cheese as the submitter suggested in the instructions). Also, once you put the toothpicks in, you couldn't put them seam side down b/c of the toothpick sticking through there to hold the seam closed. This was a great idea, but it was just too much of a hassle for me...It would've been easier to just make a grilled cheese (still using the cream cheese mixture ans cheese b/c it was tasty), and cut it into sticks, or whatever. Again, this is just my opinion, and someone else may have better luck w/ them. I'm glad I tried these, just wish they would've worked the way I was thinking that they would. Thanks for sharing. :)

A lot of work for a small outcome. I used white bread and it ripped. I also used way to much onion(which is my fault so I'm not rating it on that). If you don't mind a lot of work and don't add too much onion then it is the recipie for you! Very tasty !

The first time I made it I made it as directed but folded in half instead of trying to roll, stuck a toothpick  in diagonally  at the edges, was easy to flip and worked great.  The 2’nd time I made it as a sandwich with 2 pieces of bread, but sliced it into thirds before baking, pieces touching. It was easy to flip all 3 pieces at the same time. The flavor combination was delicious and my hubby wanted 2 more helpings after the first one! For those who enjoy lots of cheese filling then it’s perfect. I’ll be pleased with 1/2 the cheese.

Love this. Tastes so good it's unbelievable. It didn't stay in a roll shape while I was cooking it and it was difficult to flip over while I was baking it because the cheese melted everywhere. But once I got it out of the oven it seemed to stiffen back up. Very good addition to a healthy meal.
