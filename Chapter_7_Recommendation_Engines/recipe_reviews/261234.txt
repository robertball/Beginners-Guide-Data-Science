This was great! My only caution is to watch the cheese closely. At 10 minutes mine wasn't melted or even browning. It started looking close at 15 minutes but still needed more. 20 minutes was too much. So, my guess is bake time is somewhere between 16-18 minutes. Great recipe though and loved the chives in it.
