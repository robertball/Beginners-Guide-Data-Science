I've make this quite a few times before, I've never used the graham crackers and we just mixed the grapes in the cream cheese mixture and topped it with the brown sugar and some chopped pecans.

I love fast prep recipes and this is a prime example. Easy and with readily available ingredients.  I had only red grapes and sliced them in half and it worked really well.  Topped the dessert dishes with toasted almonds instead of brown sugar only because I had no brown sugar and 8 yo grandson suggested the nuts.   I made this shortly after lunch to serve as dessert for dinner and left it in fridge for about 6 hours.  Tart and sweet and crunchy.  Colorful and delicious!  Thank you for sharing!!

This is a simple & yummy dessert that eveyone will enjoy!  I have made this before, but not with the crushed grahams. Better, I think, to add some of them on the very top, so they stay crunchy.  I have layed with toasted, chopped peacans before and also have added a little bit of Baily's Irish Cream to the cream cheese mix...not too much, though so it doesn't get too thinned out.  Yum-o!

This is delicious! My whole family liked it. I made it for a pot luck where my husband works using low-fat cream cheese & fat-free sour cream. There was none left over to bring home. Thanks for sharing.

Loved grape salad before, but the graham crackers make this even better.  The only thing that I changed was to put the graham crackers on top instead of on the bottom, so they wouldn't get soggy.  My son, who doesn't like grapes, loved it.  It's so easy to fix, and every one loves it, except for maybe people who like their fruit plain, of whom, I am not.

Mixed reviews from absolutely loved it to I'd rather have a handful of grapes.  I'm not crazy about the graham cracker bottom crust.  It gets pretty soggy.  Next time I'll take one reviewer's advice and do the graham crackers on top--and definitely add some Bailey's to the cream cheese mix.

I used reduced fat sour cream and cream cheese, and chocolate graham crackers, since that's what I had on hand.  Particularly liked the cream cheese layer, and I think its flavor would marry equally well with fresh strawberries and cherries.  The brown sugar sprinkle bleeds into the cream cheese topping pretty quickly, so if you want even nicer presentation, chill and then add that last.  Simple preparation and nice to have another option for a grape dessert, other than a nice fresh fruit salad.
