I love this! Followed the recipe exactly. I can’t stop eating it—even had some cold first thing in the morning ???? I think it’s the Andouille sausage that makes this so delicious. Don’t leave it out or substitute.

Didn't change anything in the recipe, just served it as a stand-alone dish instead of over rice. Tasted great, had zero bad comments... :-)

Used the bone from my Christmas HoneyBaked ham instead of ham hock and eliminated the andouille sausage but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out SO delicious!! Served with corn bread it was a perfect New Year dinner.

Very good.  Added cooked rice to the pot after the beans were done.  Much like red beans and rice.  Thanks for the recipe.

I chose this recipe because of the andouille sausage. This stuff is amazing. It’s the best pot of black eyed pease I’ve ever made. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

When I made this, I didn't have sausage in the house so I just used ham.  It was still good.  It will definitely become part of our winter comfort foods!
