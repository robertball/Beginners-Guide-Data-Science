LOVED this recipe! I can't believe it wasn't rated earlier. I went to a friend's place to watch the all star basketball game and thought this would be good to prepare, was a little hesitant because there weren't any reviews, but sincerely, they were a hit. My friends love the taste, thought they were very flavorful. The Cornflakes gave the crunch, the baking gave us a better conscience and they were very easy to make. I added extra hot sauce because I prefer it spicier but otherwise, AWESOME!

These were pretty good, I used blsl chicken breasts in stead and cut them in to "fingers" I cut down on the red pepper ( using a half cup honey and a tsp of red pepper) and it was perfect for us!

YUMMMMM!! i cant beleive there are not more reviews.  This was excellent and easy to make.  If you don't like spicy you can just reduce or omit the pepper flakes from the honey, but these were all gone.  Excellent cool out of fridge or at room temp for lunch the next day also. I will be making again this weekend, way to go Boomdog!!

Can't really rate it because I haven't tried it yet, but I'll give it 4 for now just because it sounds awesome. A piece of advice for the breading that falls off - after coating the wings in the cornflake mixture, stick it in the fridge for an hour, or the freezer for 30 minutes before baking them. The cold will make the breading actually "stick" to the chicken. I can't wait to try this recipe, I absolutely LOVE honeyed wings.

My family loved this recipe. I used chicken breasts instead of wings. My son went back for seconds. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I made these wings for a Hotwing Throwdown.  I really worked the crowd with them, looking for a win.  They are delicious!  Perfect just the way the recipe states.  Don't change a thing!  I did turn mine half way through baking just to make all sides crispy.  These did not win the throwdown, but they are a winner with my family!

We thought these were really good! I marinated the wings in the buttermilk mixture overnight. I was hesitant on putting that much pepper flakes into the honey, but decided to do it anyway. I am glad that I tried one before putting it on all the wings because it was waaaaaaay too spicy, like I lost my breath spicy, but maybe that's just me because the other reviews had no issue with the heat. I fixed it simply by straining the pepper flakes out of the honey and starting over with less. I ended up with just enough heat for us. These really are everthing they say they are, crunchy, spicy, sticky and sweet-a GREAT combination! I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used blsl chicken breast sliced in smaller pieces and they turned out great! Marinated for a full 24 hours. When assembling I realized I had no cornmeal so I had to skip it but they still turned out crispy. Used more than a tablespoon of the red pepper flakes. Crunchy and spicy. Love it!

I read the reviews, got short on time, and ended up eating these without the honey sauce on them. I wish I hadn't. They were crunchy, alright, but the breading was pretty dry...like it looked like it was dipped in flour even after baking. The marinade made the chicken really good, though, so I'll try it again with the honey.

This needs to be retitled to "Super Tasty"!  Every single person in the house tonight enjoyed these very much.  The honey drench totally hit the mark and easily became a favorite for me.  Along with many other reviewers I am surprised these haven't been reviewed more.  This recipe definitely needs promotion.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

made these tonight- I marinated over night and for whatever reason the coating didnt stick evenly. Also I baked for closer to an hr. - 40 mins was not long enough. I put them into a large bowl, drizzled the honey over and that was good. I just didnt find  enough breading stuck, maybe the corn flakes weren't finely ground enough?

This was very good.  I only had chicken tenders on hand and it still came out very tasty.  I had trouble with the cornflake mixture falling off and sticking to the pan.  I will try this again.

This was fantastic! I used chicken tenders instead of wings. Didn't have any cornflakes so I used Uncle Sam cereal.  It was just the right amount of spicy for us, but it does have a kick! Overall this was easy to make, yummy, and much healthier than fried chicken. I will be putting this in the regular rotation.

These were great, particularly for oven baked wings!  I marinated the wings for just about 8 hours before dipping and baking.  I, personally, didn't care for the honey sauce, but that's due to personal preference, no fault in the recipe.  If you dig honey, you'll love it!  If you're not a honey fan, like us, use the wing base and coat w/YOUR favorite sauce (which is what we'll do next time).  THANKS for a super CRUNCHY oven wing, Boomdog02!

My breading was also very floury and dry after baking. The chicken also dried out (to be fair- I used white meat). The honey sauce was overwhelming, the spice didn't balance the sweet- even after adding extra. 
The marinade smelled AMAZING, and I may use this portion of the recipe again in another form.

I thought this might be too spicy for my family so I omitted the hot sauce and added more red pepper flakes.  This was delicious!!! The next time I make this I will add the hot sauce (just halve it for us) because I could see it was lacking some kick when I omitted the hot sauce.  We couldn't get enough,  thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy yummy!  A made exactly as directed, except I served the warmed honey on the side (personal preference).  I also switched the red pepper flakes in the honey for lime zest since I was making it for kids and they couldn't get enough of it.  Soooo good.  Making more right now since I only got my hands on one little wing!

I enjoyed this chicken. It is good with or without the final step of coating in honey. My husband asked me not to dip it in honey, so I did half in honey and half not. Either way is good, but I think the ones dipped in honey taste better as leftovers. The next time I make the recipe, which does take much preparation and time, I'm going to dip the wings in honey for the sole purpose of putting them in the fridge so I can eat them the next day, rather than they day they are ready. They taste so good that way. Definitely not a 30 minute meal seeing that I let them marinate the 24 hours, and then taste better the next day after cooking, but good.

This is the second time I've made these, and my husband loved them both times. For some reason, I forgot to review these the first time, so now I can't remember how crunchy they were.  The second time around, I couldn't get them that crunchy, but my DH still really enjoyed them.  Is there a trick to getting them crunchy??? I marinated them overnight, and took off the extra marinade.  Also, I couldn't get a lot of the corn flakes to stick either.  I'll have to try refrigerating them as per the other review's recommendation.  Either way, they're still tasty and great as an appetizer.

If you love crunchy wings that are perfectly cooked and still moist inside than look no further...you could swear they were fried except that they are no greasy, which is a good thing.  We followed the recipe up until the honey coating which we did a hot mango chutney instead and they were fantastic.  You could put any sauce you like and they'd be great but I will try them with the honey sauce sometime.

SUPERB!!  I made these last night and my husband and I could not stop eating them!  They're also pretty easy to make, and you can practically just suck the meat from the bone with these due to the fabulous marinade.  Will absolutely make again and again -- thank you for the wonderful recipe!

These were a flop for me. The breading came off some of the wings & they weren't very crunchy. Maybe it would better to use blsl chicken breasts cut into strips, idk. I tried to salvage them by throwing a couple in the deep fryer but that caused all of the breading to fall off. The naked wings were really good tho(thumbs up on the marinade!!). I did 1/2 w/the honey & red pepper flakes no one really cared for it, saying it was too much honey. I thought they were HOT! No one else did:)

Teenagers LOVE this!  Always a superb combo to use honey and red pepper flakes with chicken.  Perfect blend of sweet, spicy, and crunchy.  And not hard at all!

The wings themselves are pretty good. I used panko breadcrumbs and all purpose flour instead of the cornmeal. They came out nice and crispy on top but slightly soggy on the bottom.  Would reccomend using a wire rack to bake these. 
The honey sauce was not that good. It's certainly overpoweredthe t

OMG!!!  I made these tonight for my husband and I.  I generally do not eat wings but I couldn't stop eating these! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the amount of crushed pepper for which I used only a dash because I was afraid they would be too spicy.  A bit more next time will do.   I will also reduce the amount of honey to 3/4 cup next time as there was a lot of it left in the bottom of the bowl. Use non stick foil with a light coating of cooking spray so the clean up is easy.  AMAZINGINGLY Delicious.......

UH-MAY-ZING.  These are just stupidly delicious.  The first time I made them I used wings, and it was bliss.  The second time I used skinless chicken breast, and those came out too dry (still yummy but difficult to chew).  HOWEVER I'm going to try that again, but will drizzle them with butter before baking, which will replace the fat that would have come from the skin on the wings.  I am literally drooling while typing this by the way.

I made these last night for the Super Bowl. Not sure that I've had sweet wings better than these. I marinated the wings for a little over 12 hours. Be sure to crush the flakes well and really press the wings into the mixture. I ran out of honey during the first batch, so I melted butter and a lot of brown sugar in a saucepan, and added some rum and pepper flakes to the mixture. It's the breading that makes the recipe, so if you're thinking of a different flavor go for it, but DON'T skip the marinade step!

I made these for a tailgate and EVERYONE raved about them!  There were very few leftovers.
