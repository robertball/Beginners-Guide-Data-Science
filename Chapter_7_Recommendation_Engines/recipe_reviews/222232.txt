My husband and I loved this dish.  We like spicy food so we added extra peppers and used the hot red curry paste.  It added extra flavor.

A creamy and very delightful soup. Made as written except as follows: subbed 3/4 lb. shrimp & 3/4 lb. sea scallops for 1 lb. shrimp, subbed seafood stock for water, doubled the red curry paste, and omitted the rice crackers and sliced basil. We did not remove the seeds from the jalapeno pepper which gave it a welcome hint of heat that was well within our tolerance zone. At this juncture, there are 4 other reviews. All but one mention adding ingredients to give more ‘heat’ to the soup (e.g., doubling the jalapenos or adding cayenne pepper). We would be comfortable with it but I can see where that may disappoint some folks, especially with children . . . taste as you go and only add more if sure you want it hotter. Another very good recipe, Chef John.

Holy Cow, this was great! I had a 6oz can of Lump Crab, so I tossed that in at the same time as the Shrimp. Upped the curry paste to taste.  In the future I intend to experiment with adding Mussels and Scallops too.  Thanks for another great recipe!

This was so easy and fabulous.  However, I doubled the curry paste and the jalapenos because I like it really spicy.  However, even doubling it wasn't too much and others that don't care for too spicy that it was perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly.  For the tomato soup I used Pacific   Organic Creamy Tomato Soup that comes in a box  (don't forget  to shake it before using).   I found the bisque's flavor a bit mild so I added a heaping teaspoon of the Mae Ploy red curry paste in addition to the 1/4 tsp from the recipe.   It was so good.  My husband went back for a third helping.   I will make this again because it is so quick, easy, and of course delicious.

Thank you Chef John for another very tasty recipe! I omitted the flour to avoid the extra carbs and added 2 fresh diced tomatoes and the result was delicious. My husband and I both loved it.

this was VERY good. I was unsure how how hot the Thai red Pepper paste would be, so I bought the mild paste, gave it lots of flavor. You can get all the flavours without a lot of heat doing this. The paste came in a packet in the Asian part of supermarket.

I'm a nutritionist, so used Brummel and Brown.  Wanted a basic shrimp bisque with less fat, and it worked great.  Omitted coconut milk, used regular onion and cayenne for jalepino   .  Not a fan of curry so just added parsley.  Soup was roasted red pepper and tomato from Trader Joes, which is excellent.  Good soup without all the saturated fat calories!

Very good soup. I added siracha as well. It was a little thinner than I expected but my husband liked the flavor so much he wants me to make this with a seafood medley of squid, mussels, scallops, and prawns. I think that would be great too!

Tasted great, but was very, very thick. Only made enough for 2 large servings. I think my problem was not measuring the water after simmering the shells. Will definitely be trying it again very soon.

I substituted 1/8 tsp ground red cayenne pepper for the curry paste and fish sauce.  I skipped the cracker and basil but sprinkled dried parsley on top to finish.  Delish.

Love it. Fantastic full flavor, a little pink salt and whamo. This will be a staple for us moving forward.  I think we could use 1 sauce pan.

It was just ok.  Flavor was overly dominated by Campbell's tomato soup.  I'd try it again with a base made from fresh tomatoes.

So good! Followed the exact recipe till the end when I added a bit of cilantro and lemongrass pastes, just because I had them on hand. After serving the kids I added a cpl tablespoons of Siracha and a dash of Cayenne pepper for the heat my husband likes, but I thought it was excellent either way. Thanks Chef John...I've made several of your recipes and we've never been disappointed!!

I didn't have any jalapeno so I used red chili flakes and Sirracha Sauce. also had regular tomato soup instead of creamed. I used a whole can of lite coconut milk and used 1 tsp. of yellow  curry instead of red paste. It turned out fabulously!! Big hit I will make this again!

I 'eyeballed' all the ingredients.  Pre cooked the shrimp, then chopped and added these in at the end.   It was delicious, and it was pretty easy.    I will definitely make this again.

I used twice as much curry paste to give it some more Thai kick. Turned out great.

Very good, lacking a little something.  I'm not sure what, but this is still the best bisque recipe I've  made. I'm trying to copy a recipe I had at a restaurant so I'll keep looking...or tweaking until I figure it out.  Thanks for submitting!

This was fine once the canned soup taste was overridden by some extra spicy curry powder.  I'm usually not one to use a recipe with canned soup in it, and now I know why.  Next time I'd try some tomato paste in place of the canned soup.  Also added some fresh cilantro in place of the basil (had no fresh basil) to complete the transformation.  Other than that, I did stay true to the original recipe, and the taste was very good.  Oh! I sliced my shrimp in half, lengthwise; when they cooked, they took on the most adorable and elegant corkscrew shapes - delightful!

Incredible!  We've made it twice in a week.
Both times we've used precooked shrimp (much easier to find here in the middle of the States).  We pulled the tails off and used those in the first step.  It worked out fine that way.
The second time we made it we doubled the coconut milk, and I think it was even better than before.

I was skeptical but this turned out amazing. I am not much for using canned soup. I added 1 can of diced tomatoes. Broccoli, asparagus, and mushrooms. Skipped the jalapeno. Added more curry paste. Skipped the water and made a roux out of the shrimp and butter with the  fish sauce and a couple tbs of water. Amazing!!!

This was a hit, even with my 3 yr old! Substituted chicken broth for the water. This one's a keeper!

loved this soup. i was not as spicy as i expected but good all the same. i did not add the fish sauce because i forgot to buy it when i went shopping so i added salt instead. next time for a more spicy flavor i will add a little more jalepeno pepper and maybe a dash of cayanne pepper. i also added in some crab claws. this is a winner for me! would definitely try this soup again..

This bisque is unbelievably good. Rich and creamy and just the right level of heat. If you like chef John's recipes on this site, check out his Food Wishes blog. I have learned so much from this guy in just a few months and he has never put out a bad recipe. Thanks Chef!

This was wonderful!  My  peppers were not at all hot; I should have left the ribs in.  But I added red pepper flakes that pulled up a subtle and nice heat.  Defininetly a keeper!

Had this at a local restaurant. Its very tasty. This is a close second. There is a lot you can do to modify. Like Fresno Chilies, Hatch Chilies, Thai Chilies, Peanut Butter, Garam Masala, Cashews,...I've even thought about rice or cinnamon. Its a good base recipe. Thanks.

So easy to make and tastes amazing. The only thing I did different was I doubled the curry paste. I will definately make this again!
