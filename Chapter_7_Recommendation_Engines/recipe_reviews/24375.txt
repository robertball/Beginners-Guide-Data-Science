I absolutely love this recipe.  So kid friendly and easy.  A meal in itself.  The only change I made was the avocado.  I used thawed frozen peas instead.  My daughter rated it A+++++.

Loved this salad.  My husband and I both kept going back "for just a little more."  I used light ranch and reduced the amount by half.  Also used 2% cheese and half the chips.  Added a layer of salsa over the beans (for the flavor and to make up for the reduced dressing) and saved the chips for a last minute topping.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I could not fit this recipe in a 11x13 pan, so I layered it in a large bowl.  I was a little leary of adding the crushed chips and then letting it sit 30 minutes for fear of getting soggy - much to my surprise, if you layer according to the directions, it comes out superb!

Good suggestion to substitute the black beans.  Also, my family appreciated that I did not use all the dressing it called for.  I used about 1/2 to 2/3 and made the rest available on the side. I, too, agree it could be made the night before a lunch, but not too far in advace because the avacado starts to turn brown.  Really yummy!

This salad was a hit with my familly, easy, unusual and delicious. I used Litehouse brand ranch dressing and the flavor it imparts to this salad is incredible. Wouldn't change a thing.

I will make this again.  I used fresh salsa instead of a tomato and I used frozen (thawed) guacamole instead of a fresh avocado.  Also just a chopped onion. Left out the red cabbage as well.  I needed something fast and had to use what was on hand.  The lettuce as a little soggy (Duh!); but it was still delicious.  Will stay closer to the actual recipe next time!  Thanks for a good one, Gail.

There was some of this salad left over and the next day it was just as good ...so I think it can be made the night before. I did cover it with saran. Good salad.

Absolutely delicious!!  It seriously took me 5 minutes to make and it was SO good!!  I just used the pinto beans straight from the can after I drained and rinsed them and it was delicious.  I didn't use as much dressing as it called for, I just drizzled it over the top.  Oh, and for the chips we used pepper jack Doritos.  It was SO good!!  Really this is one of those things that I will make all the time with burgers, chicken, etc.  It would be perfect for a summer bbq.

I did tweak the ingredients to make it a "diabetic friendly" meat free dinner for my DH!
In place of the carrots, cabbage and lettuce I combined a bag of classic salad mix with romaine lettuce for the base. On top of the lettuce I spread a layer of guacamole...hubby really dislikes avocados but they're soo good for him...then I replaced the tomatoes & onions with a generous cup of salsa spread over the gaucamole. Next I layered a can each of rinsed black and unrinsed pinto beans with chili seasonings. To cut calories and add dairy I mixed 1/2 bottle of light ranch dressing with 1 cup light sour cream and spread this over the beans and capped it all off with 1 cup of reduced fat shredded Mexican style cheese...placed in fridge for 30 minutes. Instead of adding the chips to the salad I crushed a quarter of the bag and sprinkled them over top right before serving.
Viola...a healthy taco salad!!!
Thank you

This was a very good salad and easy to make! I followed the directions with a few slight changes. I left out the carrots and tomatoes and added a few spinach leaves to the lettuce since I had them in the house. I didn't have enough ranch dressing so I used a recipe from another 7 layer salad which turned out delicious! More delicious than the ranch dressing would. Take 1 cup mayo and add 1-2 tbsp red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Add enough milk to make the dressing pourable. We layered it in a big bowl instead of a pan and used tongs to get it out so you could easily scoop all layers. We will make this again!

This was super delicious and easy to make.  I used Ken's Buttermilk Ranch dressing and it was out-of-this-world.  I only used about a cup of Fritos - and crushed them.  However, I'm adding bacon to this next time!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I gave this a 4, only because I changed a few things...I used black beans instead of pinto, and I also used Hidden Valley Ranch's Spicy Southwest Ranch.  This is delicious, and even the "non-salad" type guys gobbled it up!

I used black beans and thawed green peas.  Put it in a trifle dish: beautiful!  Great healthful choice for a special occasion.

Amazing salad that goes well with any BBQ! As my husband has a latex allergy I have to omit the Avacados. Instead I add a pound of ground chicken that has been browned with taco seasoning. The kids love it!

Wonderful! Made it for a luncheon at work and everyone scarfed it down quickly! I put together the lettuce, cabbage & carrot part in a large bowl last night. Then I diced my tomato, chopped the green onion, and crushed the chips and put them in individual containers.  I put the salad altogether about half hour before serving. I used light Ranch dressing.  Everyone loved the avocado! I will be making this again.  Thank you!

We had this for dinner on Friday night with leftovers on Saturday night.   Excellent recipe.  We made the following changes, we used fresh greens, chard, spinach and cabbage from our poly tunnel instead of lettuce.  Left out avocado and used Chickpeas instead of beans.  I made a ranch style dressing using yogurt and mayo, maybe a cup in total, which I split. I put half on top of the beans and half over the chips.  I used mature cheader as it was all I had.  Even my 12 year old daughter cleared 2 bowls of this!

This is a great salad as is, but I made several changes:  used about half a bottle of light ranch with several squirts of Tapatio (Mexican brand) hot sauce, used one 6.75 oz. bag of Light Tostitos, omitted the red cabbage (personal pref), and used halved cherry tomatoes.  Next time, in addition to these changes, I will use kidney or black beans instead of pinto, and I will double the avocado, cause I just didn't think there was enough of it.  Also try sprinkling the avocado with fruit saver to prevent browning.  This is a great potluck or summer bbq dish.

It was wonderful!  Way too much for the two of us.  I hope the leftovers will be as good.
