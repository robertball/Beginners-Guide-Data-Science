A bit time consuming but they were worth it. My kids loved these (teenagers). They really did taste like cinnamon rolls. However, there was enough glaze and swirl topping for a double recipe of the pancakes. I used 1/4 cup for each pancake (my norm) and the single recipe when made this way netted 8 pancakes. I will make these again but not as a 'regular' weekend breakfast - this is more of a 'special occasion' breakfast for us.

Tasty! I cheated and didn't make the pancakes from scratch, I'm sure it would have been even better if I did. But when making them for myself (and let's be honest, the dog may have helped a little), I couldn't bring myself to make the whole enchilada. I halved the recipe for the cinnamon mixture and the frosting. I made silver dollar sized pancakes (2Tbs batter) and had enough drizzle to make 8. My tip is to turn down your griddle a little lower than you normally would. The longer the cinnamon swirl sits on top, the less that leaks out all over the griddle when you flip.

My rating reflects the little girls' declaration that these get 100 stars!  I would have given it less, but then they were the target audience after all.  The directions to making the pancakes were easy enough to follow until I got to actually making them.  The recipe says to pour about 2/3 cup of batter for each pancake.  I started to do that until I realized that I would have only gotten a couple of pancakes from this and that they would have been way too big to even begin to turn!  I cut them to 1/3 cup of batter, but if I were to make these again, I'd even make it 1/4 cup of batter.  As it was with the 1/3 cup, I only got 5 and 1/2 pancakes---for the 8 servings I should have been able to get.  I couldn't make the frosting drizzle, so I put that into a bag, too, and the results weren't very pretty.  But I have to say that my eaters inhaled the results, and that's all that really matters, isn't it?!  Thanks for making me look like a hero, squeeziebrb!

My daughter wanted cinnamon rolls for her birthday. These are just as good as without all the work. We use a cast iron pan and instead of flipping, just stick in a 350 oven until they are done. You'll have to eyeball this.

We make these so frequently, I bought some squeeze bottles for the sauces. Works great!

I've made these twice. The first time was such a hassle. When I put the cinnamon swirl on and flipped the pancake it smoked so bad. I had to take it off. I ended up making the pancakes as normal and drizzling the cinnamon sugar mix over top to prevent burning of the sugar and sticking to the pan. They turned out awesome. The second time around I knew better. So good!!

This was really good. I also cheated and used pancake mix. On top of that, I did something a little different. I left out the swirl of cinnamon sugar in the pancake and made it a butter spread and lots of little pancakes. I spread a little between two pancakes and then put the icing on top. Tasted great and the family raved on and on. Thanks!

We thought this was amazing! Rather than making the cream cheese frosting, however, I just used some pumpkin goat cheese as a topping because my husband doesn't like cream cheese frosting. Otherwise, I followed the rest of the  recipe and it was delicious.  For me personally, the pancakes didn't need quite so much of the sugary swirl; it makes for a VERY sweet pancake. But I will definitely make these again!

They  are good . Rather messy . Had trouble with the cinnamon filling. Swirling  It on the pancakes was not easy. It seemed like it was too thick. Any suggestions on that issue?  They were a bit too sweet for me. But my family liked them..  They are rather time consuming. Might have to be better organised on which part to make first. You have to have all three parts of the recipe made before you start making the pancakes , if it is not all assembled that causes a big problem.  The cooks tip at the end should be included in the recipe when cooking the pancakes not at the end. Sometimes people do not read through the whole recipe to the end with the tip. Not a well organised recipe.

These pancakes were amazing.  I doubled the recipe and got 12 pancakes.  I think next time I will double everything except the cream cheese icing.  I made this for 4 teenage boys and they were gone within 2 minutes.

These were pretty tasty but have room for improvement. I would start with making steps 3 and 4 first. Having the dough sit while I prepared the other ingredients seemed like an inefficient use of time.  I would also try using lemon juice to sour the cream but I did not this time. These are rather messy but the overall thought was tasty.

I will say this they tasted good I did swap techniques half way through. I did 1/4c batter (store bought) to make extra pancakes. When I added the butter/sugar mix it just seemed to leak out but it also kinda made the pancake a bit soggy. It took a really long time to get it crispy but then it would start to burn on the griddle. So half way through I just cooked the pancakes as normal and then spread the sugar cinnamon like butter on the pancakes and then drizzled the powder sugar frosting (I just used milk,vanilla, and p. Sugar).  Family tried it both ways and seemed to like it better the second way so save yourself some extra effort and add it at the end.

It was good, but not worth the work. Definitely tastes like cinnamon rolls mixed with pancakes. However, you might as well make cinnamon rolls from the Pillsbury tube...same basic flavor with a third of the effort.

Taste alone is fantastic, however I agree that the recommended 2/3 cup is way too big for flipping and would only yield about 3 pancakes. I would give it only 2 stars with regard to the actual making of them as the drizzle seeped out of every one of them even though I didn’t go close to the edge. They didn’t look anything like some of the

I found it too much work for the result. A cinnamon swirl that was difficult to do, too much rather bland frosting for the amount of pancakes, both combined with a run-of-the-mill pancake recipe.Would do a couple things differently if I made again, but probably will try a different recipe next time.

Love love love!! I used premade pancake mix because I’m lazy but after that, it’s really not that hard to make. Maybe next time I’ll make a different frosting. This one was good, just not my favorite. Overall, the recipe is a complete success!!

I used an electric griddle set at 325*. I used 2 tsp of cinnamon, and I cut the icing recipe in half.  I also only made them a 1/4  cup of pancake batter per pancake. They were delicious!

So the first pancake I made was without the brown sugar mixture (I forgot) and I tasted the pancake and it was soooo good. The second one I didn't forget the swirl. For me I came up with four pancakes. I didn't make the cream cheese part because I thought it would be too much for me. It's hecka sweet...I actually prefer the pancakes without the brown sugar mixture. Will definitely make again without the mixture.

time consuming but very good. Tasted exactly like cinnamon rolls. My only thing would be to dial back on the amount of icing made. I put a thick layer of  the icing on the pancakes and I still had a ton left over!

Well, after following the directions exactly, I have come to the conclusion that these are not really all that great! Like others have expressed, it's way too much work and time-consuming. I also put the cinnamon mixture in a squirt bottle, thinking that would make the job easier. I was wrong - my mistake! Also, I too found out that the cream cheese topping made too much for the amount of pancakes. Now, the pancakes: mine were rather flat - not "airy and fluffy" like others' were. Maybe I mixed the batter too much? Again, that would be my mistake. Finally, the cinnamon "swirl" (mine didn't "swirl" well) caramelized when cooked so it was rather hard to chew. With all this said, I'm glad that others had favorable results.

Really good! I didn't use the pancakes part of the recipe, I made the pancake batter using Krusteaz Buttermilk mix (just add water), then followed the recipe for the cinnamon mixture and cream cheese icing. They get a nice crispy, cinnamony-sugar crust on the bottom side (you serve these bottoms up) and it is so good!

Tastes amazing. But the cinnamon swirl melts out from under it when it is flipped and cooked on that side.

I would put a little less baking powder as I could taste it a bit in the pancakes.  Otherwise excellent.

Time consuming but it was the first time making them. I didn't really like the consistency of the batter and definitely was not enough unless you're making them for yourself. Overall, they're yummy!

The first time I made these exactly as written. Everyone loved them- even my partner who doesn't like sweets.
The second time I used pancake mix- that was mistake! Instead of delicate, lighter than air  pancakes, I had dense and bland cakes.
Next time I'll skip the icing and use cinnamon syrup and double the batter portion for my family of 4.
These are worth the labor for a special breakfast.

I used my own pancake recipe, which is a basic old-fashioned but I added 2 scoops of Salted Caramel protein. Kept the cinnamon filling and icing the same, although we had some left over. Made them for my husband's birthday and he said they were honestly the best pancakes he's ever had! They were sooo good, tasted exactly like a cinnamon roll, looked like one too. Will definitely make again.

The wife and kids loved this!  I recommend cutting the icing recipe in half, as it was far too much.  Also, when you cut the hole for the cinnamon sugar mix, make it fairly small.

They are delicious!
I added a peeled and chopped Granny Smith apple to the batter and substituted maple syrup for the cream cheese sugar glaze.
Took advantage of the swirl filling and simmered a sliced Granny Smith apple that I later used to decorate.

These were so awesome, I can't wait to make them again. I cheated and used pancake mix, but the rest of the recipe I did exactly. The cinnamon/sugar ratio is perfect and the icing is not too much. Perfect balance! The only thing I would change is to beat the cream cheese first and maybe only microwave for 15 seconds to melt the butter since my cheese came out slight lumpy.  Otherwise great great recipe. We'll be making this again soon.

My husband LOVES these pancakes. Not for those on a diet or the faint of heart, but the occasionally make an amazing cheat breakfast.
