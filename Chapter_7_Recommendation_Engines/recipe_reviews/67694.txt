This is good. Very moist. I took it to work and several people said they couldn't stop eating it. Unfortunately, I don't care much for the taste of butterscotch chips and I found that they seriously overwhelmed the flavor of the pineapple. Not a fault in the recipe, simply my personal taste. In fact, I think I would like the recipe just fine with NO butterscotch chips (or possibly vanilla chips instead). I used Caramel Frosting VI from this site on it, which I think would work even better without the competition from the butterscotch chips. I found that I did not need to bake it for the 40 minutes stated as the minimum baking time, 35 was about right, so watch carefully. I am not sure why this recipe is under the "cookies" section, it was much more like a cake than a bar cookie when I made it.

YUM! These flavors complement each other VERY well. Even my dad, who when I first told him I was making these said he wouldn't eat them and thought they sounded weird, tried one and said that I "won him over." I left the nuts out and sprinkled unsweetened coconut on top before baking. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan, and they baked up perfectly in about 35 minutes! The canned pineapple tasted too sweet to me, so I sprinkled a little bit of lemon juice on it before adding it to the batter, and it was perfect! Not too sweet, but not sour. I believe that as written the recipe would still be 5 *s... I will have to find out by making them again! =)
