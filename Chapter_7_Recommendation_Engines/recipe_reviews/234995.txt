I used golden raisins but would use Craisins® in the future.  There's one confusing step to this recipe which was a bit of pain to correct.  In step #3, it says to "drain and discard wine mixture," but I think this should read "drain and discard mulling spices."  You want that reduced wine mixture and those infused raisins, but not the mulling spice mixture (it's already done its job).  Should have used my head, but I added the mulling spices to the wine and raisin mixture, and when I realized that there were things in that mulling spice that might break a tooth, I had to go through and pick all of the pieces of the cinnamon stick, star anise, etc. (all those hard things)....aaaargh!  Think what you need to do is put the mulling spices in a cheesecloth bag and tie up or even better, if you have a tea strainer, use that.  This part was a hassle, but on the positive side, it does taste good.

I found the directions confusing, I wish they would be broken down into more steps. 
my raisins did not turn out very well, at all.

Easy recipe. Be careful not to overlook and don’t use all the water from the vegetable apple mix when pureeing. You can always add more in later but it made mine very soupy. I used red cooking wine, cranberry juice water cinnamon cloves and nutmeg and cooked cranberries. I don’t like raisins. They tasted grate. I sprinkled feta cheese instead. I’m using it for Thanksgiving tomorrow and will have to bake it in the oven and hopefully cook out some of the soupiness.
