The taste largely depends on the BBQ sauce you choose.  I mixed and let the other ingredients sit overnight to help the flavors blend.

This is a keeper. I wouldn't change a thing. The sauce was very rich and flavorful. Everyone I know uses just BBQ sauce and Little Smokies. I knew there had to be something better...this is it. Everyone that tried them at our New Year's party wanted the recipe, and raved about them. I want to send out a big thank you to the original submitter. Happy New Year 2010!

I add either beer or whiskey.  The alcohol cooks away and it gives them a very nice flavor.

Great easy recipe.  I made these for a holiday party and people really liked them.  I cooked them in a crock pot all day and they really took on a good flavor.

We did not care for this at all.  Made following recipe.  I make a fab sause that everyone loves out of grape jelly and yellow mustard.  Will stick to that one.  I know it is a winner.  For people that like them with bbq sauce I guess this is an ok one.  Like others have said it depends on the sause I am sure.  Will not be making it again and have deleted from my recipe box.

I did forget to add the onion to these smokies, and used a little less of all the other ingredients called for. Turned out great, made them on the stove top because I had the meatballs in my one and only crock pot!

My wife has been making this recipe for years and it is always a big hit at friend and family get togethers.  The only difference is that her recipe calls for 3/4 cup of Burbon.  The alcohol burns off so there is nothing left but the taste and aroma.  Five Stars!

SO good! I had never even heard of Little Smokies before a friend asked me to make them for a shower and I just couldn't wrap my head around putting grape jelly with hot dogs, so this recipe won out. It was SO easy, and everyone raved about them. (I was actually asked to make them again.) I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and did them in the crock pot. Quick, easy and delicious!

This is a simple, classic party appetizer that will always be a big hit with your guests. The brown sugar in the recipe is perfect for cutting the tangy flavor of the BBQ sauce, making a rich flavorful sauce. This will be the only little smokies recipe I use at my parties from now on.

The brand of BBQ sauce will definitely make or break this recipe. I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and no brown sugar at all (we don't care for sweet bbq sauce, but that is all a matter of personal taste.) I minced the onion really finely, to get the flavor without chunks. This was a really good way to pump up the flavor of the bottled sauce.

Great recipe, always a hit with the whole family. I use maple & brown sugar bbq sauce and half the amount of brown sugar you use, and add in a tablespoon or two of spicy brown mustard and mmmm mmm is it delicious!

A very easy, delicious recipe.  Certainly good for a party, holiday, or buffet meal.  I mixed everything together the night before my Christmas lunch and then put it in the crock pot a couple of hours before lunch the next day.  Especially appealing for kids.

I've never liked these no matter where I've had them, but this recipe was great.  I made them as a request for an appetizer during a game and they were gone in no time.  Everyone loved them, thank you for changing my mind on these little guys!

Loved by ALL! I had been curious for years about what recipe this lady I used to work with used for Little Smokies. One bite of these and I didn't care if this was how she did it or not, cause from now on this is the way I am gonna do it! I was crunched on time trying to clean and get things started so I left out the onion. Still VERY yummy!

I was originally looking for a recipe that used grape jelly... But am more than glad I tried this one! These were delicious- perfect amount of sauce and the flavor was spot-on. The only change I made, was using onion powder instead of diced onion. I suppose minced instead of diced would have been okay, but something about chunks of onion in the sauce did not seem appealing with such a smooth texture, so I feel satisfied with substituting onion powder and the flavor was still really good. This was super quick & easy. Really convenient to mix up ahead of time & then throw it on to cook later, when ready. I'll be keeping this for upcoming agendas that require quick & easy appetizers or party snacks! Definitely prefer this over some that all for grape jelly. The flavor of the brown sugar & bbq sauce goes perfect with lil' smokies.

These were very good!  I didn't quite put a whole cup of brown sugar in because my husband doesn't like sweet BBQ sauce.  Very good!  This also makes a lot of sauce and I put in 3 packages of the little smokies.

This was some of the best smokies that I have made in a long time. I made them for the Super Bowl and they didn't make it to the end of the game. The only thing I did was not put the onions in them. Just because I didn't have them. But it was great just the same. Thanks for the recipe I know I'll be making them again soon.

these are so good, but i've always made them with some whiskey. we call them whiskey weenies. i add about a cup of cheap whiskey and let simmer for 2 hours. it gives it a great flavor and makes the sausages a little more tender.

These sweet and sour appetizers were a hit at my bbq with friends.  Used only one bag of smokies and cut the sauce ingredients in 1/2 just to try the recipe.  Should have doubled it instead.  My picky five year old said "I loved them!".  Perfect in my mini crockpot.

My family seemed to like it.  Not a big little smokie fan in general, so I'm not a very "fair" judge.

These were good. Nice flavor but the sauce was a little too thin.  Cooked it with the crockpot lid off near the end of the time and that helped thicken it up some.  Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing!!! I had a party at my house and made these in my crockpot and before I knew it they had nearly all disappeared! My friend called me the next morning telling me she brought some home with her and was having them for breakfast because she was craving them!! Thanks jrh05 for the wonderful recipe!!

Easy and a big hit.  Everyone loved them (except the 3 yr old, who didn't try them bc she was too busy chasing after our cat!).  I mixed everything up the night before, then dumped everything in the crockpot about 3 hours before everyone arrived. Worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe as is, but like my old one using grape jelly & chili sauce better.  As I used that combination for meatballs, I wanted something different for the little smokies.  Thought it was ok, but I wouldn't use it again.

This recipe was the best for our Super-Bowl party.  I did not add onion. 
Trust me, the guys all said this was the big hit! It was the first time I've made these. I will serve again !!

Made the recipe exactly as is, and it turned out great!  Big hit with the adults and kids!  Brown sugar and Worcestershire add a sweetness and bite that complement the BBQ flavor.  I will be making it again.

Hubby made these the other day for an appetizer when we had guests.  The flavor is great, but I think you can cut back on all the ingredients except the wieners a bit because there is way too much sauce.

This was a big hit at our Wii bowling tournament.  My Neice had made some too and just dumped BBQ sauce on them.  My sister-in-law just loved this sauce and kept what was left to add my neice's little smokies to.  I followed the recipe as written.  It's a keeper!

These were yummy! A little too sweet, but it's probably because I used a sweet honey bbq sauce.. It didn't matter, they were gobbled up quickly! Will make again for sure!

Loved it!!!! It's a keeper, you can even add more smokies. I added a little bit of garlic and cayene pepper! Everyone loved them! Thanks for sharing the recipe! I used sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce! Cooked on crock pot for 4 hours on HIGH because I used double the amount of smokies. The amount of ingredients is enough even of you add twice the amount of smokies. Really good!!

I loved the ease of this -- throw all the ingredients in your slow cooker and come back a few hours later. Great! I only used as much brown sugar as I had left in my pantry, which was nowhere near a full cup. If I had to guess, I'd say it was probably 1/3 of a cup and the little smokies turned out JUST FINE. I suspect a full cup would have been way too over-the-top sickly sweet for my taste. FYI.

Let's just say all of our guests this evening kept making the same comment over and over"....ooooohhhh...mmmmmm....this sauce is awesome!"  I stuck to the recipe with an extra dash of chopped onion.  Delicious.  They were even pouring the extra sauce over their tortilla chips (suppose to be for the salsa)! :)

Zowie- these were the best little smokies I- or any of our guests- ever had!  I used Bulls Eye bbq sauce, and followed the recipe exactly.  This is now my go-to recipe for bbq sauce; I'm going to try it today with Cookie's sauce (store didn't have BE), cut it in half, and mix it into baked beans.  Excellent, excellent recipe- thank you!!!

Followed the recipe without any changes, and they turned out great.  Took them to a church dinner, and brought back an empty platter.  Kids especially like these.  Will make again.

I tried this recipe for my New Year's party recently. I thought they would weird with the onions in there, but I added them anyways. They were delicious! Everyone else liked them too. By the time the party was over, the tray was pretty much empty. I will definitely make these again.

These were delicious and so easy to make!  Because I made them on New Year's Eve, and didn't go to the store until that day, the regular smokies were sold out.  Instead, I used cheddar smokies, and they were delicious in the recipe...I may always use them!

I've been looking for a simple smokies recipe that didn't require grape jelly, and this was perfect. You can change it up a bit depending on the flavor BBQ sauce too. It took no time to assemble and didn't require any supervision. Great snack/appetizer when you want to be apart of the party and not stuck in the kitchen.

Made as recipe is written for a potluck at work. Was one of several things that was eaten  until gone. :) Scrumptious! Next time, tho, I think I will add a little bit more onion.

I use this recipe all the time but make a lot of tweaks. I do not put onion in since some friends do not like onion. I put in a few shakes of onion flakes or onion powder instead for taste. I ALWAYS double the recipe bc it goes fast and use one reg bbq suace and one brown sugar flavored bbq suace. Depending on the crowd I will put red peper flakes into the mix also. I've never made little smokies with grape jelly and I hear that's  very popular but its hard to change recipes when this one has been tried and true.

Loved it. Cooked it longer and a little higher than suggested because we like the smokies more cooked, but everyone loved the recipe.

Excellent! Used KC Masterpiece and used all ingredients as written. So easy and tasted great. Almost left out the onions but glad I didn’t. Make sure to have some bread for dipping.

I made this exactly as written with the exception of adding a few more little smokies. It was a big hit at our family gathering.  Will definitely be making this again.

Excellent!  I made a few moderations.  Instead  of  ketchup and brown sugar,  I  used 8 oz of  grape jelly.   I also added 1/4 cup of  Bourbon.   The result was wonderful!  Will keep  this  version handy!

I will make again.  My boys love this and make up ways to change recipe  by changing the jellies, condiments and spices. If you have boys you will start with two packages the first time you make it BUT. It will take about 5 minutes for your boys  to say what do you mean they are gone.

I added 1/4 tsp cayanne pepper to spice up the plain commercial BBQ sauce I used. This is super tasty and easy.  Sauce so good you want to lick the slow cooker

I made this to bring to friends and their family on Christmas, it was a big hit with them. I took a shortcut from chopping onions and used Vidalia onion bbq sauce. I personally didn't care for the ketchup and will make this again without it

I made this but with some slight modifications. I used a 
40oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's original bbq sauce,
20oz bottle of Noh Hawaiian bbq sauce,
3/4 cup ketchup,
2 cups brown sugar,
4tbs Worcestershire sauce,
2/3 cup minced sweet onion,
3-4 pkgs of Hillshire Farms Lil smokies .
The Noh Hawaiian bbq sauce adds a nice touch of zing.
I combined  all ingredients, except the lil smokies, in a sauce pan and simmered just before boiling so as to let the flavors meld.
OMG! Is definitely on my favorites list.

Made these for a Halloween party because they look like little bloody fingers. Did not put the onion in but everyone loved them! There was a lot of excess sauce and it was hard to eat with a toothpick, so we used a ladle to pour the extra smoky sauce over peoples weenies on little plates. It got really sticky and messy for a party snack... But it was delicious.

I made this for my son's first birthday. It was great. I altered it a bit. I used Kielbasa links cut up into 1 inch rounds and added garlic, hot sauce and red pepper flakes for a kick. The adults at the party absolutely loved them!

very good recipe. But I added a 12 ounce rolling rock and let it marinate over night. They turned out to be quite delicious. Way better than your run of the mill BBQ sauce and grape jelly recipe.

I have made this recipe several times and it is a family favorite.  I usually use a little bit less sugar than the recipe calls for.  Also because smokies are expensive I use precooked sausages, like polish sausage, cut into diagonal slices and follow the recipe as written.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, except reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I used Sweet Baby Ray's regular BBQ Sauce and added Onion Powder and Garlic Powder. I made a double batch which disappeared before half time!

Used Sweet Baby Ray's and heated all the sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Poured over weenies in crockpot and let in sit overnight. Not sure why I do this but another review did this to a meatball recipe to develop flavors so thought it would be a good idea here too. Heated a few hours before our party. I had a hard time finding 16 oz packages so just used three 14 oz packages and it was still enough sauce but you may have to add a little more ketchup or extra bbq sauce if you have some. They were totally devoured by the end of the night!

These are an awesome change to the regular lil smokie sauces! Just made it for Superbowl and everyone including little ones enjoyed! The only difference I did was add about 1/2 c whiskey and cooked them on the stove for 2-3 hrs on low! Thanks so much for this great recipe:)

On the stove or in a slow cooker, these are a hit for any gatherings that involve finger-food! Super bowl, Halloween party- I've taken these little smokies to multiple events and they always disappear quickly. Thanks for this great and simple recipe!
