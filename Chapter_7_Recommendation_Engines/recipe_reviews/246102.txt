I made this exactly as written. Turns out 6 cups of small florets is two heads of cauliflower.

Needs salt. I made this as written but reduced the milk to 2 cups, and reduced the flour to 1/4 cup. The flour to fat ratio is way off compared to any recipe or dish I've ever made.. But decided to roll with it, with the minor adjustments. 
The end result was creamy and I was pleased with the consistency. This dish could really benefit with the addition of salt, possibly herbs, some hot sauce or jalepenos, and garlic. I will definitely make a variation of this again trying a different cheese.. Maybe the tex mex blend. Also will try roasting the cauliflower instead of boiling to add more flavor and keep more of the nutrition.

I loved it!  I’ll definitely make this again when I’m craving some Mac n cheese (healthy version). I used coconut flour instead of white flour for a little extra keto-friendliness. You can’t taste the difference between the two flours. And I also cut some kielbasa sausage for that extra saltiness people have been commenting on. Yum :)

I took the advice of another reviewer and added salt and fresh ground pepper. Cut back on the milk and flour. Very good. Will make this again.

We enjoyed this as a side dish for Easter dinner. I agree with other reviews that call for more seasonings. Not being a fan of salt, it was nothing that a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper wouldn't fix. Corey liked the fact that the flavour of cauliflower was prominent. I was worried about the sauce not being thick enough so I used whole milk in the amount called for, and cooked for about 5 1/2 minutes until it was as thick as I wanted it. The overall result was a creamy sauce and nicely browned topping. Personally, I would add additional seasoning or another handful of cheese to the sauce, and I would definitely make it again.

We really liked this, my son asked for the leftovers for his lunch! I read online that 6 cups of cauliflower is a 4 lb head of cauliflower, I had a 2 lb head so I halved the recipe. I microwaved the cauliflower instead of boiling as I don't like boiled vegetables. Baked in my convection oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, it was browned nicely on top and bubbly. Will definitely make again. #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA #EndWithAmazing

would have given this 5 stars had the sauce been a little "tighter". i found it somewhat soupy, which is not a bad thing but i like mine a little tighter. when i make this again  i will use perhaps 1 cup less milk. i used the  Cracker Barrel Shreds Double Cheddar 35% less fat variety. i like to cut the fat where i can. this cheese is very cheesy. if i didn't know it was the less fat type, i would have never been able to tell. oh, i did place it under the broiler for just a bit to get it nice and golden brown on top. My son, who does not like cauliflower, took what was left over, home! :)

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added my own seasonings just like I would if it was really Mac & Cheese. After my seasonings and using less milk it was perfect. Delicious.

This was so delicious. My family loved it. I did add some salt and pepper. I cut back on the milk and flour. I only used 2 cups of milk and 1/4 cup flour. I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic to the onion. This will be added as a family favorite.

I love this recipe! A healthier twist on my favorite Mac and cheese. It’s not extremely healthy but doesn’t have the carbohydrates of noodles. The only thing missing in the recipe is salt to taste. Also, the conversions of the measurements is a little confusing because the total Parmesan is 1/3 cup and the instructions are in tbsp. Overall, great meal!

I added a few more veggies, tossed them in a little olive oil and oven roasted them.  Then I sautéed bison separately.  then I made the cheer sauce with cheddar and Gruyere.  Put it all together for a full meal casserole.  My husband ate 4 portions for dinner.  I will  make it again.

After adding a few select spices based on other reviews, this turned out to be a good side dish! Cut the recipe in 1/2 since there was only 3 of us. The sauce was creamy and overall the dish was cheezy.

Delicious!  Some minor changes based on what I had on hand: crushed garlic croutons for the topping, Cracker Barrel old Cheddar, frozen cauliflower, and added salt & pepper. Definitely will make again. Creamy, cheesy and comforting dish!

this recipe does require a few tweaks to get the cheese sauce just right (less milk and less flour) I would also add salt and pepper to the mix to give it the appropriate cheesy zing but it was definitely a good place to start and I really enjoyed the cauliflower!!

I followed the recipe exactly - it's certainly quick and easy to make and very good though I think it just needed a little something more - maybe a little salt and/or perhaps a little garlic in with the butter and onion.  I would make it again but not as a replacement for macaroni - it's good enough to stand on its own.  #EndWithAmazing #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA

I kind of thought there was an excess of milk so scaled it down to 2 cups.  Also added fresh ground black pepper to sauce.  Not bad.

I am a big fan of Cauliflower cheese, and this was as comforting as a cauliflower cheese is.   The ratio of veg to sauce was perfect.   I did place it under a broiler for a few minutes to get the crumbs nice and brown.  Comfort food does make one feel warm and cozy on a rainy night like tonight.

I really enjoyed this. I had to cut it back to 1/3 of the recipe as there is only one person here that can have dairy. Other than that I made the recipe as written.  I loved the creaminess of the sauce and the slight crunch of the cauliflower.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add a little white pepper.

This wasn't bad. I made the recipe exactly as written, except I had a scant 6 cups of cauliflower. That's okay, it just meant more sauce. The topping was really yummy; you can't go wrong with panko. This is a kid-friendly dish, though the grownups might want to add some hot pepper flakes or other spices to jazz it up a bit. This dish was dead simple to make and only required one saucepan (reuse the pan you used to boil the cauliflower to make the cheese sauce). I put the dish under the broiler at the end of cooking to make the topping more crispy and browned.
