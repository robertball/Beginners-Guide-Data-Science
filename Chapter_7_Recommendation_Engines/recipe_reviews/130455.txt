Tender and tasty, not to mention easy and fuss free.  I had never cooked a whole rabbit before so I was a bit leery heding into this.  Instead of olive oil I used bacon drippings, but otherwise made it according to the recipe.  I think I would double the onion next time, just to have plenty to serve w/the meat. I served it for company and everyone said it was fantastic.

I've made it several times now, and it's a good recipe, classic and simple. Works with fresh or dried herbs. The only thing I adjusted was the time and temperature: I used a different baking dish. I left it to bake for 1-1/4 hour, covered for the last 30 minutes.

This was great my boyfriend really loved it. I would maybe add more cumin next time. I didn't lay it on a bed of onions since my boyfriend and I aren't big fans of onion but instead I used small white potatoes. They were quite tasty. All and all I would make this again. Also just remember the safe internal temp of a rabbit should be 160 F so I would use a meat thermometer and use hat as a reference for when it is done.

i have never had rabbit before let alone cooked one. the flavor was excelent. the reason to only got 3 stars is because my husband said it was juust thrown together and i didnt cook it very good because i was scared of it. i also had to coo0k it 3 times longer than the recipe said and the rabbit was still not done.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. This was my first attempt cooking rabbit and next time I will try a recipe that cooks it at a low heat over time or a soup. This just was too difficult to eat.

We followed this recipe to a tee except for that fact that our rabbit was cut up. It came out dry tough and didn't have a good flavor at all. I definitely will NOT be using the recipe again.

This recipe came out wonderfully and is one of my favorite rabbit recipes yet! Things I did differently: my rabbit was already pieced out and not whole and had been soaked in a salt brine overnight (I did this before deciding on what recipe I should use). I substituted coriander for cumin since I didn't have any cumin on hand (and am not a fan of it anyway) and a yellow onion for red onion since I can't eat red onions. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This came out nice and moist something that's hard to get with rabbits and I didn't have any problems with it being over or under cooked. This is one of the easier rabbit recipes I've found and I'll definitely be making it again! Goes great with a salad or other greens. The smell will have your mouth watering. It's great the next day too!

I made it with about twice the cumin and you could taste the rosemary primarily with a hint of cumin. I also would use mare onions the next time. Tasty tender and no gaminess at all
