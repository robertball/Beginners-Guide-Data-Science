This pie was delicious and not difficult to make at all. I did cheat and use a frozen deep dish pie crust as I was short of time. The filling was more than adequate to fill the pie and the crumb topping did not all fit on. Next time, I would cut down a bit on the sugar in the filling, but there are no other changes I would make. The cinnamon and nutmeg are nice in the filling. Put the pie on a cookie or abking sheet, as the filling drips out a bit. I would definitely make this again. Thank you!

This was a great recipe.  I did cut the sugar in the filling down to just under a cup, and could almost cut it to 3/4 of a cup, for my taste.  I also cut down on the topping, as another reviewer said it made too much.  Even after cutting it by about 1/4, I still ended up with about twice as much as I actually used, so I am saving the rest for future use on muffins or something.  I also omitted the pecans as I didn't have any, and really don't like them much anyway.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I had fresh picked strawberries and rhubarb, home made pie crust, followed the recipe exactly except the home made pie crust.  I put all the topping on, which was a mistake, I'd cut it back by at least 1/3.  The filling could use a little more flour so it doesn't run when you cut a piece.  Overall result it tasted more like a tart cherry pie than strawberry rhubarb to us.

This was my first attempt at cooking with rhubarb and it turned out delicious. The modifications I made were...1 c. of rhubarb and 3 c. of frozen strawberries, a prepared pie crust, about 1/2 of the crumb topping, 1 c. of sugar in the filling, heaped my 1/3 c. of flour in the filling, and added a pinch of salt. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

A-MA-ZING. So good. Cut the sugar in the filling to about 1 cup, which was plenty, and I used about 1/2 c. pecans because that's what I had, and it was great. I used brown sugar instead of white in the topping and cut it down just a bit, maybe by about a quarter, and since I had room in the pan I just went for it and put it all on even though reviewers said it was quite a bit even when cut down. But who doesn't love crumb topping, right?? It was lovely, I wouldn't do it any other way. The cinnamon, nutmeg, and pecans add such a nice, rich flavor to the rhubarb and strawberries. I am going to make this again VERY soon!

This was so good! Others wrote that it was too sweet, but I didn't think so. I can't wait to make it again. 
Oh, and I only made half of the crumb topping, but I'm sure it could be good with more.

This pie was incredible and very easy to make.  I too found that I had extra topping so didnt use it all.  I also used more strawberries and rhubard than the recipe called for bc i love a very full pie. I will make this again and again!

This was the first strawberry rhubarb pie I've ever made and it was fantastic!!  I wouldn't change a single thing for the pie recipe.  For the crumb topping I used 1/4 c. Butter, 1/4 c. Brown sugar, and 1/2 c. Flour - resulting in the best crumb topping I've ever made for pies!!  Plus my hubby love it, which is a total plus in my book.

I made these as tarts.... The recipe worked perfectly for 24 store bought tart shells.  I reduced baking time to 25 - 30 minutes and only made half the crumb topping.  Perfect for gift giving... Yum!

Easy and quick.  This looked too simple to be true.  When I made the topping I thought this would never work.  Results:  Delicious--great flavor and the topping, the best ever.  One of the best pies I have eaten and it surely surpasses any commercial or restaurant pie. This is a very adaptable recipe for any fresh fruit-- go slow on the sugar depending on the sweetness of the fruit used. CAUTION:  use a baking sheet under the pie pan while baking and don't eat the entire pie in one sitting!

This was SO delicious!! This is my husband and brother-in-law's favorite kind of pie, so I thought I'd try it out, even though I've never made a pie from scratch before. It was super easy and it turned out so great! I got compliments all around! I had extra rhubarb so I made two more to freeze. The only thing I changed was I reduced the amount of sugar in the crumble in the second two because my husband thought the sweetness masked the taste of the rhubarb, and I made one of them raspberry rhubarb! I have to say I like the raspberry the best! I prefer the amount of sugar called for in the recipe though. Definitely will make again!

Loved this pie. Next time I will reduce the sugar in the filling and crumb topping and substitute in brown sugar for white sugar in topping. I added about 1/2 cups oats to tipped by and it was delicious.

Yummy and easy recipe!  Used pre-made pie crust and took advice of others to reduce the sugar in filling to about 1 cup, which was still plenty sweet.  Might use even less, maybe 3/4 cup, next time.  Also, cut the crumb topping in half and it was the perfect amount.  Very happy with the results and it was very quick and easy to make!  Would definitely make again.

This is amazing!  Love, Love, Love it!  I made the crust as directed and it came out great, but I am sure you could use a store-bought refrigerated crust if you want to save time and hassle.

I didn't make the crumb part, I ended up just doing a tradional double crust pie, but did I ever get rave reviews! The combination & balance of rhubard & strawberry was perfect! It wasn't too sweet, nor was it too tart. Thanks for a great recipe. I look forward to trying the crumb part next time.

JessWaka...Your recipe turned out amazing.  I thought everything you said with the measurements turned out perfect...I love copying a recipe and it turning out delicious.  I personally think if this dish was in a baking contest it would take top three places.

This was GREAT!! I cut the topping in half as others suggested, but next time I’m doing the full amount. Mine didn’t quite cover to give real texture to the top (but, no big deal). I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, which was plenty. No pecans because the boyfriend doesn’t like them. This is a keeper!! Adding it to the pie rotation!:)

Delicious! Made it with frozen rhubarb from last season and fresh summer strawberries. Tweaked the topping a bit to my apple crisp version. 1/3 c butter, 3/4 c brown sugar, 3/4 c oatmeal, 1/2 c flour, 1/2 T cinnamon. So yummy!

This was delicious!  I had frozen rhubarb and native strawberries from last season that I wanted to use so I thawed and drained them well and they worked great.  I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup,  and did not use nuts as my family doesn't care for them added to desserts.  The taste was not affected and this will be my go to recipe for this pie in the future.

My husband loves Strawberry Rhubarb, my rhubarb plant was ready to be thinned out so I decided to try this recipe. I doubled the rhubarb 16 oz by weight,  left the strawberries the same 12 oz by weight, halved the sugar in the filling and used 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg and cinnamon. I omitted the pecans and halved the topping portion. I baked on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet for 30 minutes at 400 then 350 for 30 minutes, it was perfect. Will defintely make this pie again!

Made it in a deep dish pie pan, and needed to put in one more cup of fruit to fill up the pan better and it needs all the topping to cover it in a large pie pan.

I added 1/4 cup dry tapioca to the strawberries & rhubarb and allowed it to sit for 10 minutes before adding the flour & spices combination.  This helps prevent a runny pie as I used thawed rhubarb which had some water content in them.  I also added half tsp cinnamon and half tsp nutmeg to the crumble crust.  I also sprinkled a tablespoon of tapioca on the bottom crust before adding the strawberries & rhubarb.

I used 3/4 cup sugar in the filling and one of the reviewer's  suggested 1/2 recipe for crumble. Added some cinnamon to the crumble too. It was AMAZING! People who don't eat rhubarb liked it!

baking pies is one of my favorite things to do! It was very easy to mix together and bake. I do agree with some of the other reviews, it's too sweet.  Strawberry rhubarb pie needs a level of tartness to it to balance out the sweetness and this pie doesn't deliver on that. It also didn't set up well. For those that are saying that there is too much crumb topping and they are not able to put all of it on the pie ...don't use a standard pie plate, this pie needs a deep dish pie plate. Loved the crumb topping!

I reduced the sweetner (Stevia) & butter to 1/2 of the recipe.  I didn't use any crust.
Then it was great!

This is, hands down, the best  strawberry rhubarb pie I have ever made. The sugar crumb topping is perfect although I did only use about 2/3 of it. Better to have a bit more than too little. I also made a mini version  with a Glueten free crust for a guest  and she was blown away!  I did use fresh frozen strawberries that I had picked in the summer along with fresh frozen rhubarb from last summer's garden and I can only imagine how much better it will be when I make it this summer with perfect ripe berries and fresh picked rhubarb!!

I added more nutmeg than it called for in the recipe. I cut down on the sugar to a little less than a cup as recommended  by previous reviewers.  I felt the topping actually could have been more. I use almost an identical topping for Apple Crisp. I pat it down over the fruit to "seal" it in better. I did't have any left over, and it didn't spill out during baking. I didn't foil the edges and they didn't burn.

This pie was delicious.   Followed the instructions exactly and it was a little to much sugar in the filling.   Next time I would only use about 1 cup.

This pie was amazing! It was hard not to go for a second piece! The only change I made was using lard instead of butter in the crust because that's the way my great grandma made it.

It really was a delicious pie, but it was runny. If I make it again, maybe I would use less fruit, maybe reduce some sugar, but use some ground up tapioca to absorb the juices or even some cornstarch.  I can't tell you how much to add, but I sure don't want to have this happen again! Be aware this is a potential problem if you are using fresh picked berries!

I've been making strawberry rhubarb pie for years but this is my new favorite.  Everyone went crazy over it.  The only change was to use a deep dish frozen pie crust...my crusts just never work.  Thank you, thank you for your recipe!

Pie was wonderful. I cheated a little and used a frozen pastry shell, defrosted and then followed recipe. The crumb topping was extra good. I was hesitant at first because I have never made a crumb topping with anything except oats or brown sugar. But it browned beautifully.

This is so good. I make it every time rhubarb is in season. My family asks for it a lot, but I try other pie recipes that is in season. It's best with whipped cream. Thanks for sharing.

This is fabulous - I keep single pie-crusts made and uncooked in the freezer so this pie is ideal since no top crust is needed.  I cut back on the sugar just a bit but other than that absolutely perfect - my family loved it and am making another for Canada Day.

INCREDIBLE!!!  My husband grew up with strawberry rhubarb pies and always "loved" them.  He said, "this is BY FAR the BEST strawberry rhubarb pie I've ever had!!"  Looks like I'll no longer be using my mother-in-laws recipe!!!!  Thanks for an easy and wonderful tasting recipe!!

I grew up in the Midwest where rhubarb grows abundantly.  When I moved to the South, I realized most people here have never tried rhubarb!  I spied it in the grocery store recently and didn't care it cost WAY too much.  My husband, born & raised in the South, was skeptical, at best.  I made this pie for him and he keeps asking when I'm going to make it again.  Our daughter is flying down here tomorrow and she's bringing a pound of fresh rhubarb!  This is a new favorite dessert...easy and reminds me of "home."

My brother said he'd never had a Strawberry Rhubarb Pie, so I bought some rhubarb this am from the farmers market, and some strawberry's. Then I went searching for a recipe and found this one. It seemed very easy. I made it and we had it for dessert after dinner tonight and he loved it. Will make this one again. I may add a bit less sugar next time. SO TASTY!

Definitely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and found, as others have, that there was too much crumb topping mixture and the filling was pretty runny when sliced.  Easily fixed, and will make this recipe again with modifications.

Excellent recipe. I substituted raspberries for the strawberries and it was just as good. Used the crust recipe too and it also turned out good.

Absolutely wonderful!  I have made strawberry rhubarb pies, in the past, which were a bit runny...this recipe made for a perfect consistency.  My rhubarb was quite tart, so the sugar amount was just right.  I did have a little trouble rolling out the pastry but, in the end, it turned out fine.

I resisted all urges to use my standard crust, to lattice the top, to omit the nutmeg, or to skip foiling the edges, and made it just as written (except for the pecans, which I just didn't have on hand).  It was PERFECT.  This is probably the best possible recipe for this type of pie.  I'm making it again.

Most are saying they used their own crust recipe, I love this one, all I changed was I added some oats to the crumb topping and I needed some extra strawberries and rhubarb to fill my pie plate, it was gone within a day!

My 75 year old father said this pie was as good anything he has eaten from a professional bakery!  Delicious, easy pie.  Great to make when rhubarb is in season here in MA.
