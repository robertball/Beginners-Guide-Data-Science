This is a perfect recipe for a busy night. I loved the fresh lemon flavor along with the peppers and onions. Extra veggies could easily be added such as broccoli or mushrooms. Leftover chicken could easily be used in place of the raw, making it even quicker.

We really enjoyed this easy one pot dish. I would have never thought to add lemon to a dish like this but was pleasantly surprised by the addition.  Overall everyone was pleased.

This was such a nice homey meal that was so quick and easy! I really wouldn't change much other than a bit of salt and pepper while saut√©ing the chicken. This new rice blend is a keeper!!!

Wow! We loved this!!! The slight crunch of the red pepper and onion and the tang of the lemon were perfect! I made this exactly by the recipe and I would say, I would just add a little freshly ground  black pepper. Easy recipe to do on a weeknight as well.
