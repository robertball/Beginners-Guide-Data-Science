My family loved this salad and declared I can make this anytime! I only used 2 tbsps lemon juice and 2 tsps Greek seasoning. I omitted the tomato, added a carrot and a stalk of celery finely diced, used the tops of 2 green onions for the red onion. I used vegetable broth for simmering, it took 45 minutes for the farro to burst open. Thanks for a great recipe.
The second time I made the salad I used PC Blue Menu Italian Farro which only took 20 minutes to burst open, the box is 1 1/2 cups of farro as well which makes it easy for measuring too.

I just discovered farro this year after cooking a Blue Apron dish for my son and his family. It's a delicious grain. So this August I  was looking for a recipe to make a cold salad with farro, and found it with this one. I love a greek salad, and am happy to have found this recipe. My garden cucumbers and tomatoes went into it, and I followed the recipe as shown. I love it-very tasty, and keeps well in the fridge for a few days! Make it!

Really robust and flavorful. This would take very well to having kale added.

Great hot or cold, by itself or as a side, as a meal or as a snack.
