Great Great recipe with some tweaking.... Here's what I did for perfect results.  I added two more tablespoons to the butter it called for, and put half of the salt, half of the almond extract and a tad bit more of the vanilla... Perfecto... They are soft, creamy, melt in your mouth......

YUMMY!  AND FINALLY I've found a Spritz cookie recipe I will keep FOREVER!!  :)   I did modify the recipe, though, by using only 1/4t almond flavoring and 1/4 t vanilla flavoring.  There was no bitter after-taste, only the melt-in-your-mouth taste of buttery spritz.  The confectioner's sugar also makes this cookie very smooth.  GREAT recipe!  It's a definate keeper!

I agree with KARLA13, the preparation is easy but the cookie after-taste isn't that appealing. Although they looked nice, I couldn't give them out because of the after-taste. I make spriz cookies a lot and this taste was like no other...

I made this recipe with three other Spritz recipes from this site.  The texture was perfect for press cookies, but I found the almond flavoring overwhelming both in the dough and in teh finished product.  I took them to work and to a church social and asked folks to rate them.  These were the least favorite of the four Spritz recipes.  I'm thinking maybe I should try them without the almond.

I have to share this with you. I have my grandmother's press, which is at least 50 years old. I have NEVER been able to get a dough to go thru it without a hassle - until now!  This is the most wonderful dough to work with. I did use all vanilla and no almond but stuck with the other measurements (I always use unsalted butter so I didn't play with the salt at all). It was a breeze - no chilling the dough.  Couple of hints though - be sure to let the cookie sheets cool completely so that your dough grabs it (I even put my outside on the deck to chill them).  Also, I found that I got WAY more than 3 dozen out of a batch - I used the wreath and camel and tree patterns and a double recipe gave me more than 12 dozen cookies (I gave up counting at that point :). Finally, I always find spritz taste better the next day (like pizelles, they need that overnight rest to really let the vanilla shine thru).  Good luck and definitely try this one!

These turned out very tasty.  However, the dough was too firm to go through my cookie press.  After adding a little more butter, the consistency was right and the cookies turned out well.

it was easy, and I concur with the other reviews, "what aftertaste??" I did customize this recipe to make 6 1/2 dozen and needed to add 1/4 more butter to work the cookie press. Overall, a great recipe for the cookie press.

I tried this recipe because of the reviews.  I have never had any luck making press cookies, but using this recipe was a breeze!  Really has a good taste and very easy to use in the press.  I give it five stars!

I think butter rich really describes the recipe well.  If you love a very strong butter cookie taste then you'll love these.  My kids loved them, my DH however didn't.  He likes a sweeter cookie with more complex flavors.  They really reminded me of the traditional butter cookies I've had in the past...similar to a shortbread, but more buttery.

Pretty good. Didn't like the after taste that much. For my first spritz cookie it wasn't that bad.

If you think the dough is too stiff and dry, then keep mixing!  At first I found the dough to be too stiff to be put through the cookie press, so I returned it to the mixer and beat the dough for at least another 2 minutes.  Then it was perfect!  The only change I made was to use 1 tsp. almond extract.  Next time I might use even more.  These cookies are light, crisp, not too sweet and of course, buttery!  As always, I used real unsalted butter.

These cookies were ok. They were a little dry. I followed this recipe exactly, except I slightly reduced the almond extract because of what other reviewers said. It was just under 1/2 tsp. There's a possiblity that those who think there's an aftertaste may be using imitation almond extract. I always use pure extracts.  When I put it all together, it was very crumbly. Other reviewers said they needed to add 2-3 T more of butter- I didn't think I would have this problem since I live in SE Louisiana and humidity is always an issue! But I had to add a few T of butter myself, and they were still dry.

These are really great spritz cookies! I love the flavor, it is just what I was looking for. I colored some of the dough red and some green, while leaving some just plain white. Because the dough got soft when I was kneading in the food color, I put it in the fridge for a while...not a good idea. The dough got so hard that it wouldn't even go through the cookie press. I had to soften it up again in my hands before I could use it. To make the cookies, I used my cookie press inserts to make white snowflakes, green wreaths and Christmas trees, and red poinsettias. I used my round Christmas sprinkles to decorate the Christmas trees, some Wilton sparkling sugar for the snowflakes, and holly berry and leaves sprinkles for the wreathes. They looked so pretty, and are going to make an excellent addition to my Christmas cookie trays! Thanks so much for sharing...these are great! I am going to make them often.

YUMMY!  I've never used confectioners sugar and just egg yolks in my spritz cookies but I LOVE them!  I didn't have almond but I do normally like the flavor so I will get some for future batches.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to combine the ingredients and the butter was good and soft so I had no problem getting the dough through my ACME $10, 15 year old cookie press.  In fact it was better than in the past!  Do watch them in the oven though.  Like all spritz you have to take them out before you see brown edges.

These came out of my Pampered Chef Cookie press perfectly, better than the recipe that came with the press. This is the one I will use from now on!

Outstanding.  Now replacing my standard spritz recipe.  Save the egg white and add a small bit if the dough is too dry.  There needs to be a little tacky or sticky feeling to get dough to adhere to pan.

This is almost the exact same recipe my mom used when I was a kid (45 years ago!).  I looked it up because I wasn't sure about the powdered sugar instead of granulated.  All was the same except the egg yolks.  Her recipe calls for one whole egg instead of two yolks.  I have her cookie press and all the inserts.  I just made them today for the first time in over 15 years, with my daughter.  I did it like I did when I was a kid- made 3 colors of dough, roll each color into a long snake, put all three colors next to each other and then put into the press like that.  Each cookie then has the 3 colors on it.  They tasted exactly like I remember them!  Brought back lots of memories of cooking with my mom.  I'm sure she was looking down and watching my daughter and I make these together like she and I used to.

Great cookies!  I had never used my cookie press before, so I used this recipe to try it out.  I had a little wrestling and learning to use the cookie press itself, but the cookies turned out great.  Very pretty and great taste.  Just don't overbake them!  Watch them closely!

My friends and family raved about these cookies. My mother requested these for Christmas. I had never heard of a spritz cookie and this was the first recipe that popped up when I searched. Mom says they tasted just like what her mom made. I will be making these every year from now on.

I hate to give bad reviews but this was awful.  The dough did not work at all in my electric cookie press, switched to a manual and didn't work their either.  The cookies that did come out were very bland.  Will never make this recipe again.

I followed the review that said to add 2 extra tablespoons of butter in my first batch and forgot to add it in my second batch. The first was much easier to work with and creamier. I would keep the extra little bit of butter. These hold together very well after baked. I did notice on my Pampered chef stone they baked in 9 minutes perfectly with very light browning on the bottom. Since I needed a cool cookie sheet for the last batch, I used my non stick cookie sheet with some parchment paper, they cooked in 6 minutes and almost burned, bottoms much darker. I love my stone cookie sheet, makes all the difference in baking cookies.

What a waste of butter and ingredients! I've made cookies for a long time now, including spritz. I'd misplaced my mom's recipe, so searched on the site for one.  This one produced cookies that didn't even stay soft - they were rock hard. I tried cooking for less time, lowering the oven temp, etc etc, but each batch ended up the same.  We couldn't eat them, so broke them up and put them out for bird food. Sure hope it didn't hurt the birds!   Find another recipe - this one looks okay, but ends up with no taste at all, and baking up hard. Bleah!

I've made this recipe for years and it is so delicious! I reread the reviews before I made them today and I added 2 Tbsp. butter as a reviewer suggested and it made such a difference. It is a stiffer dough but this made it perfect! I also add 1 tsp. almond, 1 tsp. vanilla, our preference. SO good and easy!

This was the worst spritz cookie recipe I ever had.  The cookies were flat and overwhelming with the almond flavor.

Quick cookies to satisfy a sweet tooth! The dough was a bit thick for the cookie press, so I thinned it with a little milk. They had a nice delicate flavor, perfect with a cup of tea, but they were a tad on the dry side. Still a good cookie, though!

These always are delicious and they're extremely easy to use with a cookie press. I've made them numerous times now and I have never had a problem from the first pressing to the last, as with other recipes that soften way too much with time. They come out crispy on the bottom but have a light, airy texture. My husband's grandmother always made cookies like these but would never give me the recipe. Well, ha! I found it!

They are quite tasty, but I had trouble with them coming off the press, which was the reason I gave it only 3 stars.  (I used the extra 2T of butter too, so I am dumbfounded).  My Pampered Chef press has never given me problems before... and I decided to try this recipe because I didn't have granulated sugar, but these took easily 20 minutes just to press on the tray.  Even though they tasted good I won't use this recipe for the press again.  Maybe as a crust for a bar of some kind, or to slice and bake.  I will say I didn't notice an aftertaste, but if you use real almond extract I don't know why you would.

*sigh* I had a tough time deciding on how many stars to give this recipe... they tasted pretty good, better than most spritz in my opinion and the texture worked WONDERFULLY in my cookie press.... HOWEVER... the dough was so thick it burnt up my stand mixer :(  and I have mixed some thick dough in the past.... and they spread in the oven :(  another minus in my book... and this recipe does not yield very many cookies... I am thinking a whole pound of butter (double recipe) is an awful lot to use to get as few cookies as I did... so all in all I gave it a 3... I will probably go back to my "Snowflakes" recipe with cream cheese, it works better overall for me!

Great butter cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was perfect for my mom's electric cookie press.  I did taste a bit of the aftertaste some are talking about, but it wasnt overpowering.  I actually like it bc I love the taste of almond extract.  I did notice that you want to eat these within 24 hours for the best taste.  I noticed after the first day they got a little too dry and crumbly and just not as good and melt in your mouth.  Im sure I will make again sometime when Im in the mood for some.  Thanks for the recipe!

This absolutely did not work!!  I had to add the egg whites PLUS other liquid because the recipe as is is way too crumbly. I added two tablespoons of milk and it was great.

I can't rate this fairly. I don't know what happened with these cookies! I followed the recipe to a "T" and they turned out horrible trough the cookie press and melted out like pancakes in the oven. They definitely had too much almond extract. I just can't seem to make good cokies with a cookie press.... *sigh*

I was looking for a reciepe that was close to danish butter cookies to make as christmas pressies this year, found this reciepe.  My kids could'nt get enough of them, i am making another batch right now, we just love them.  this time around, i am adding lemon essence to see what they will taste like.  I have found really beat the butter and icing sugar till really light and white, fluffy to get that melt in your mouth taste. And this time round did'nt use the cookie press to time consuming, just rolled the cookies, gently put a thumb print on top, and take out of the oven before they brown.  these cookies are definatly a family favourite, will share this receipe with friends.  my husband has just eaten a cookie from the lemon flavoured batch he said they are better than store brought danish butter cookies, he is a retired chef, does'nt give compliments out very much. congrads on a fab reciepe...

We gave this recipe three stars due to the flour amounts listed.  We only used 2 cups of flour.  2.5 was too much, made for dry dough. We also  baked for 5 minutes and stayed by the oven because they brown quick.

Very good recipe!! Make sure you don't over cook them, and use quality ingredients! I also found that waiting until the dough is at room temperature helped make the dough go through the press easier.

I'll start with what I didn't like about these (because that's the very short list).  Using the recipe as written, these were just a little too dry for my liking.  Having said that, if you like the Pecan Sandie texture for your spritz cookies (crumbly and melt in your mouth), then these will be right on the money for you.  On to the good!  The flavor of these is wonderful.  I have absolutely no idea what the reviewers mentioning an 'aftertaste' are on about.  It tastes like a hint of almond, because... well, there's almond extract in the receipe.  It certainly isn't bitter or unpleasant using the 1/2 tsp as directed.  Tastes PERFECT to me.  To sum up, if you like more of a shortbread texture in your spritz cookies, then give these a try, you won't be disappointed.  If you like them with just a bit more hard weight (as I do), then try a different recipe.  There are many to choose from!

These were the best! Instead of putting them in the cookie press, I rolled them out into balls and hand pressed.  Oh my goodness...they were wonderful.  So buttery and flavorful.  I did cut down on the almond to 1 tsp and on the vanilla to 2 tsp.  Other than that, I made as is.  I was shocked at how good these were.  This is a MUST KEEP!

Another 5 stars for this cookie!  I did omit the almond extract because I don't care for it.  The dough was very easy to work with.  However.... my cookie press didn't think so.  Actually, I believe it's me.  So I just made balls (with a measure tablespoon) and used a glass bottom dipped in colored sugar and flattened them.  They're delicious!  I made 4 1/2 dozen with this recipe.  I sure wished I knew what was wrong with my goofy cookie press.....

These cookies are so good and super easy. One of the easiest I have ever made out of a press. Will make every year!! The almond changes it and gives it a little "extra" over the traditional Spritz cookie. YUM!

Six hundred cookies later, 2005 Christmas cookie baking is finally over!! Sheri, this is a fantastic recipe. Although my press was giving me a hard time and I was just about ready to chuck it out the window, the end result was well worth the frustration. I colored the dough green and once the cookies were cooled I dipped half into melted bakers chocolate and then into chocolate sprinkles. YUMMO! Thank you so much!

As many have said, this is a delicious recipe. Likewise, I used extra butter-3/4 a stick, and I used only half the almond extract while replacing the other 1/4 teaspoon with vanilla. That being said, the problems that others had with the recipe could be as simple as slightly imprecise measuring or not creaming, blending or mixing enough. Peace.

I have been making sprintz cookies for over 30 years.  I always look for new recipes, but I did not care for this one. If a cookie fell off the rack, it crumbled to pieces.  It felt like sand in your mouth when you tried to eat one. 

I am not the average baker. I know what I am doing.

These were delicious for spritz. Easy! I also added 2 tbs of butter more AND, wait for it, about 2 tbs of Baileys! Yum! I am not sure how much because I did free hand pour. So good.

Oh my goodness, these are heavenly! I did add two more tablespoons butter than the recipe called for and I omitted the salt altogether (I use salted butter, so no need to add more). They came out melt-in-your-mouth perfection!

Just ok - not nearly the flavor of my original Spritz cookie recipe.  (Tried this one as my recipe is MIA!)  Will have to find it to use next Christmas.

The dough came out too firm and I had to add more butter to make it work with my Wilton cookie press.  Otherwise they were fine.

To thick for the cookie press, added more butter (about 3/4 stick) and perfect. The taste is just like the name Rich and Buttery!  I did not experience any aftertaste as others mentioned

These cookies are absolutely delicious.  I did cut the almond and vanilla extracts to 1/4 t each and added 2 additional T of butter like someone had suggested.    I had some troubles with my press but I don't think it was from the dough.  They turned out beautiful and my kids as well as all the adults love them!  Definately a keeper.

Haven't had these since I was a kid, and they taste just like I remember. I made two adjustments though. I cut the almond extract in half, and added 2 Tbl butter like some other reviewers suggested. They came out great. The dough took food coloring well, and was easy to work with. No chilling necessary.

This is an excellent recipe...they actually turned out ! I don't know if my past attempts w/ spritz cookies were thwarted by the press or by the recipes I' used, but I was hesitant to try again  I'm glad I did, my kids love me for it.  I went with the modification suggested earlier by using 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and almond extract.  I'll be saving this one for next Christmas.

Great cookie with changes!  2 T more butter, half of the almond extract and a little less than a t of vanilla.

I was so excited to get to finally use my cookie press but now I am not sure I want to try again! I followed the recipe exactly as written and the dough was definitely too dry to use in a cookie press. I resorted to making them more of the pecan sandie look with christmas sprinkles. The cookies actually tasted very good but if you are planning on using a press may need  to search for another recipe!

I know that spritz are typically made during the holiday season, but I had a couple of egg yolks that needed using up, so I decided to make orange flower spritz.  This recipe worked so well for me.  I used my hand mixer to make the dough - only using 2 1/4 cups flour- and the dough came through my ancient cookie press very easily.  No problems, and they are definitely butter rich.  Will definitely be using again come this holiday season.

Yum! I bought a cookie press on clearance last year and tried it with one batch of cookies... And it didn't work. I was unhappy with my cheap press, so I locked it in a cupboard for a year! Then I saw someone selling cookie presses on a shopping channel... I found the press, found this recipe, and am now thrilled with using the cookie press! I followed the recipe exactly (although I halved it) and these are EXCELLENT! Buttery, crisp, not too sweet. We got almost four dozen out of a half-batch, and my daughter loved decorating them with coloured sugar. I did have to cut the oven back to 375, though. Thanks for sharing, Sheri! :)

Nice cookie for the press. Watch them closely, the bottoms brown up quickly. The taste is buttery. The texture is light. I would make these again.

These are great cookies, and a very forgiving recipe! I reluctantly had to use margarine (it was all I had) for these and they still turned out great. I followed previous suggestions and used 1/4 cup extra margarine, and I had to make my own confectioner's sugar in the blender because I didn't have any. Instead of vanilla and almond extracts, I used the contents of two vanilla beans. Also tinted them pink for a baby shower. I'll definitely make these again.

We made this for my daughter's birthday and used orange extract instead of almond.  They were great - very lightly flavored orange - delicious.

Very good!  I used all vanilla extract instead of using almond (since I didn't have any in the cupboard), and it was a hit!!  Some of the best Spritz cookies I've ever had.  They tasted almost like the Danish Butter Cookies you can get around Christmas time.

The FASTEST cookie recipe ever and delicious as well! I was simply looking to use up 2 egg yolks and found this recipe. I didn't have enough confectioner's sugar or even regular sugar so I added some Splenda. Instead of Vanilla extract I used a teaspoon of vanilla sugar. I don't have a cookie press so I just shaped the dough into balls and pressed them with a fork in a crisscross pattern. I sprinkled some of cookies with red decorator sugar and others with pink hearts. I froze most of the cookies and now I'm all set for Valentine's Day! Thank you. I will definitely make these again and want to buy a cookie press now so I can try all different shapes. Next time I want to dip them in chocolate. Yum!

I lost my recipe that came with the press.  This one tastes good although I agree with an earlier comment about the dough being too firm.  I would recommend a little bit more butter and some granulated sugar to make the consistency a bit softer.  I do like having both vanilla and almond extract - no funny aftertaste at all.  That may come from too much almond so if you don't like that, use half as much.  All in all, this yields a very buttery-tasting yummy cookie.

This recipe was pretty good but the recipe that came with the Spritz gun was better- I'd use a little less almond extract and also some granualated sugar mixed in with the confectioner's.

Wonderfully easy to make...if desired, try mint extract instead of the almond and make them "thumbprint" cookies with marmalade in the centers.  Delicious!

I made the cookie dough exactly as the recipe stated. The first batch was great, easy to form, 8 minutes in the oven, turned out perfect. I added Raspberry Jam in the middle. Next batch was harder to get through the press and burned in less than 8 minutes. I remembered a review that recommended more butter, tried that, back to perfect! I'm not sure what aftertaste some reviewers commented on. My whole family loved the recipe!

I loved this recipe! My family has made spritz for years but this recipe intrigued me because it called for confectioner's sugar instead of granulated. This difference made a hug difference in how tender the cookie is, fantastic! The only change I made was to reduce the amount of almond extract to 1/4 tsp to reduce the after taste, similar to others suggested.

For the very first using my cookie press this worked wonderfully!  I used only vanilla and added the extra butter as per the other reviews I also lowered the temp to 375 and only cooked them for 4-5 min and they came out nice and soft and can't keep my children out of them.  This will become a Christmas tradition in our house.

I received a cookie press for Christmas and I was dying to try it out. I choose this recipe over countless others (all are really similar this one just seemed the simplest) and I am so glad I did. They were delicious, perfect with cocoa and coffee. 
After reading the reviews I omitted almond extract. I really don't think the cookies were missing it. The dough stuck to the pan without any problems, except of course when the baking sheet was right out of the oven ( I just ran it under cold water). I'm really glad I tried this recipe, now I have something new to add to my baking collection.

this is the one...I was remembering a Christmas favorite and am so happy to have found it here. Yay!!! I added a bit less butter and rolled them out into a log and sliced out the portions and pressed them with a cookie stamp. Excellent!! (I did not have a press) now I will go get one as these are the Bomb!!

This is fabulous!!!   I've been making spritz cookies for years & this recipe is the best.  Everything came out beautifully without any problems.  It may be the result of using confectioners sugar instead of the granulated.  Whatever, they were easy to make & will look so pretty on my cookie trays.  My grandkids & great grandkids really enjoy these.  Made it exactly as written except I used all vanilla extract.  (1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla) delicious!!!

This recipe is everything I remember spritz cookies being when I was growing up- Yum! 
I did add the extra butter as suggested and left out the almond, as I don't care for it. 
I thought I was going to have the same "dry dough " issues others had, but I just had not mixed long enough. 
Cookies are headed to a cookie exchange , and I will be making more to keep :)
thanks for sharing !

I love almond extract so I kept the original recipe amount otherwise I agree with other posts that it should be reduced, it is a very strong flavor here. I had no problem with the dough being too stiff for my press but I used my Kitchen Aid to bring it all together so I think the answer is to keep mixing. I think I will use salted butter next time and omit the 1/2 tsp of salt. I made smaller cookies and they were done at 6 minutes on the dot so watch the oven.

Fast and easy! The dough takes color well. I made them green for St. Paddy's Day. It could use a bit of tang, maybe lemon zest? Thanks for the recipe!

These were very moist and sweet but I would add more extract next time.  We like the taste of almond in our spritz but also tried other extracts such as banana, strawberry, raspberry, and cinnamon.  Vanilla and Almond are the best flavor, just needs more.

Hadn't made spritz cookies in 20 years. This is very easy to work with. I actually liked the wasy the dough oozed out a tad after a "click" from the gun to complete the cookie. The reviews scared me from adding the rum extract, but next time, I will. They are actually better the next day, in my opinion! Thank you!!

These were good.  My family liked them.  I followed the comment to mix for longer than you think you should and it all came together well.  Watch these though!  My first batch burned and went in the trash.  Am about to make second batch for cookie exchange.

Great recipe - was a little worried with some of the other reviewers, but figured I would follow the recipe exactly and they turned out great!  One lesson I learned from bread making is to spoon out the flour into a measuring cup instead of using the scoop to dip.  GREAT FLAVOR and kids loved them!

This was my first try at spritz cookies. I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand, so I subbed per a different recipe 1C of granulated sugar.  I also used 1 whole egg instead of 2 yolks.  The dough extruded beautifully out of my press. The taste buttery and delicious.  I detected no afore mentioned "aftertaste".

This was the first time I made Spritz cookies and they turned out AWESOME!!!  I followed the recipe exactly without making any modifications.  I baked the first batch for 5 minutes and they weren't quite done.  I upped the time to 6 minutes, and they turned out perfectly with slightly golden edges.  I was a bit worried about the almond aftertaste that some people have mentioned, but I didn't notice anything other than a nice, rich buttery flavor.  The dough started getting a bit hard to push through the cookie gun toward the end, but this was easily solved by working the dough in my hands for a minute or two.  This could have just been because I have a manual cookie gun and not an electric one.  Regardless, this is definitely a great recipe!

Excellent cookies!  First time to use a new cookie press...its fun and everyone ate them like candy!  I decorated the cookies before cooking with gumdrops and sugary sprinkles.  I did follow advice of others (added 2 tbl of butter and didnt use almond extract but instead used 1-1/2 tsp of vanilla).  I will keep using this receipe! Thanks Sheri Lipp!

Loved this! Used a Kitchenaid mixer and C&B press. Added 2 tablespoons butter, omitted almond extract and doubled vanilla — tips from other users. I added an extra minute cooking time, as the first batch at 6 minutes were slightly overdone. These were perfect and I can't wait to experiment with other colors. Thank you!!

Perfect as written. Tips: 1. Measure flour correctly by spooning flour into the measuring cup and then level off. Do not scoop & pack. 2. Be patient. I use my Oster Kitchen Center stand mixer and I was starting to get concerned the dough was too dry but I was patient and it mixed up beautifully and worked perfectly in my Crate & Barrel Cookie Press. I baked for 6 minutes and cooled for 2-3 minutes on the cookie sheet before moving the cookies to a cooling rack lined with paper towels. The flavor is great, they melt in your mouth and don't taste greasy. Thanks Sheri for a great recipe!

I'm new to using a cookie press and have been looking for the best spritz/butter cookie recipe to use and I think I found it with this one. It's super easy and really good. It made slightly over 3 dozen cookies for me. I will be making these again.

This is it. I've been searching for a recipe that tastes exactly like my grandmother's butter cookies... I have fond memories of baking them with her when I was little. She died four years ago and every time I ask my mom for this recipe she said "Oh it's here, somewhere..." I went through most of the spritz/butter cookie recipes on this site and I knew for a fact my grandma did not use cream cheese in hers, so those were automatically thrown out. I tried one using regular granulated sugar, but it wasn't right... THIS one is right. The taste and texture is spot on. The only thing I did was increase the vanilla.   For those who think this cookie has an after taste - I guess make sure you use high quality butter. This is one recipe where you shouldn't use 'generic' or cheaper butter, since the flavor is dominant.

Good spritz recipe I just turned the two flavorings around, like that almond!!  My cookies were done in 4-5 minutes I guess it depends on the cookie press.  Enjoy the nice flavor!!

These have good flavor.  I ommited the salt as the butter I had to use was salted butter.  I used green food color to make wreaths in my cookie press and placed two cinnamon hots on the wreath for decoration.  I am not sure why I have such a problem with the cookie press, but it is a struggle for me to press these out.  I have a pampered chef press - so I really believe it is me because my press is very good quality!  I guess in the long run it is worth the time it takes me to press these out, but I only make them once a year anyway....

Simple recipe that worked well in my cookie press, though I adjusted the recipe as others have recommended:  added 2 Tbsp. butter, omitted almond extract and used 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract.  Nice buttery taste and smooth texture.  Made close to 5 dozen.

These cookies are great. They're delicate and flaky, unlike the recipe that came with the cookie press. Those cookies were beautiful to look at but hard like rocks. These cookies are wonderful. I love, love, love the almond flavor, but I don't think it was strong enough. I'd like to actually put more of it in. I made a second batch and used pineapple flavor and yellow food color. Awesome. I'm going to use this recipe to experiment with all kinds of flavorings and colors. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

This is an excellent spritz recipe! They are very easy, and worked perfectly with my cookie press. I didn't have almond extract, but they were great just with the vanilla.

Wonderful!! I turned them into thumbprint cookies and I'm filling with a buttercream frosting. I did not have a hint of aftertaste, and I followed the recipe exactly.

The cookies came out great.  I needed to work the dough a bit to get them to spritz out nicely, but the flavor and texture were great.  Defenitely no strange after taste!?!

These cookies were very quick and easy to make. I used lemon flavor instead of the almond as I don't care for almond.  I thought they were very good and as some the reviews had mentioned I didn't notice any after - taste.  Great recipe!!!

Liked it as is, no changes. It worked well in my cookie press. I was looking for something closer to a butter cookie, and while this is close, it's not quite what I had in mind.

I Made these tonight with my child.  They are delicious and very festive.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 1/4 tsp vanilla & 1/4 tsp almond extract.  I thought the dough was going to be too thick, but it worked perfectly with my Wilton Cookie press.  I used a light spray of cooking spray on the baking sheet.  The dough made perfect cookies every time and no post baking sticking.  These will be a holiday tradition. We used green food coloring & sugar sprinkles to decorate.  My child loved making these! Its the best cookie press dough I've ever used!

Worked great just as written.  Other recipes resulted in crumbly cookies.  These turned out great.  No need to look any further.  One hint - when re-using the cookie sheet, it was still too warm.  A quick wash and rinse with cool water and it worked fine.

Note I don't know what I did,but I can't get a rating other than "I did't like it". I love these type of cookies so I'm providing the differences from the original and ideas why people have had issues. Sorry my rating is messed up, but I can't get it to change. 
I can understand why people have had issues with these cookies especially being dry. I inherited the family metal press along with the recipe. My mother started baking at Thanksgiving and would freeze cookies. Most she used vanilla extract except Christmas trees she dyed green and used almond extract. I suggest one make sure they have pure extracts not imitation as imitation will make your items bitter. The original recipe is the same when it come to flour, salt, and butter. The recipe was to cream butter which it didn't specify salted or unsalted and I know my family always had salted butter and never changed the salt in the recipe. The big difference between the recipes is the original used ¾cup of regular sugar not confectioner's. Confectioner's sugar although it's regular cane sugar ground to a fine consistency it also contains up to 3% cornstarch as an anticaking agent. This along with the reduction in liquid because the original recipe used whole eggs may be why people have had difficulty using the press and finding adding butter helped, but although it helped the press issue the cookies probably had a dry texture. After creaming the butter and sugar together , eggs were beat in and then either vanilla, or almon

Love this recipe! Finally found a good one that you don't have to chill, and works in my press. I did not use the almond extract, and I used salted butter so I omitted the salt.

These made about 4 dozen,  (Don't use the air bake pan unless you bake longer). Add sprinkles before baking. Should have done that. Taste was good. will make again and try the above

So easy and delicious.  Great to do with kids.  This was the first time I have used this recipe or a cookie press.  Loved it. I did add a bit of granulated sugar and tossed in the egg whites.  It was very versatile.  I was baking with my daughter and she likes to experiment with different looks and flavors.  Blackberry and raspberry thumbprints, chocolate chips on top, cherry on top, sugar on top, chocolate dipped, sandwich jelly, sugared....  Not one cookie didn't taste fantastic.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

First ever spritz cookie recipe Ive tried! after watching my mom go through recipe after recipe unsuccessfully with the cookie press, I was hesitant to try this. However I just made them and they taste fabulous!the recipe is so simple yet the cookies are so buttery and delicious. To avoid the aftertaste, I simply used less almond extract and increased the butter. Mine are burning from the bottom slightly, but I think that is my cookie pan. I am definitely going to use this recipe again. trust me, I am a horrible cook but I was able to make these perfectly!

I was disappointed in these! I wanted to make spritz cookies and couldn't find my grandmother's recipe which is always a winner. From memory it seemed like the same ingredients (except for the almond extract) so I gave them a try. The dough was very firm..hard to press out and flavor was lacking something, even though I upped the amount of vanilla called for. I'm going back to searching for Granny's recipe. I won't make this one again. :-(

I followed this recipe exactly, and the cookies tasted fine, but did not hold their shape at all, which completely defeats the purpose of making spritz cookies.  I ended up using a different recipe, which worked great.

Needed to add 2 TBS additional butter as the dough would not pass through and make a cookie. Other than that they turned out very nicely! I will remember this recipe for the next time as I have tried many recipes that do not work well.

This is a GREAT spritz cookie. I also did some 'tweaking' - TRY THIS - YOU'LL LOVE IT! Use 1-1/4 c butter, cut salt to 1/4 tsp, cut flour to 2-1/4 cups, use 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp butter flavoring, AND ADD 1/2 tsp orange extract. Be sure to whip the heck out of all ingredients before adding flour. PERFECT FLAVOR and perfect consistency for the cookie press!!

Spritz have been made in my family for over 50 years. This recipe change have made them even better. I took the advice of one reviewer to decrease salt and almond extract. I added 3 extra tablespoons butter and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla. wish I could give it 10 stars.

The cookies came out really nice. I put the batter in the fridge for 20 minutes because I came really close to bashing my cookie press, it was that frustrating trying to work with the freshly mixed batter. But since I could have guessed that would happen (not the first time I used the press...)I'll still hand over 5 stars

I normally am not a fan of spritz cookies because they are so dry and often tasteless, but that is not the case with this recipe! I made a batch for my neighbor and seriously wished I had not given them so many. The only thing I changed was using butter flavor instead of almond (which I didn't have on hand), which I think really enhanced the buttery goodness. The cookies came out moist and soft after about 10 mins in my oven. Next time I will definitely make a double batch!

5 star recipe!   Kids couldn't get enough.   I've been searching for an absolute awesome spritz recipe and finally found it.   I truely think what makes this recipe soar above all others is the confectioners' sugar instead of granulated sugar.  We found there to be no after-taste neither.    
Wouldn't change a thing, it is perfect!     We are now starting a new tradition with making these also for Easter.     Happy Easter and Happy Baking!

I made these to take to work. A few of the ladies said they were good. But I didn't get the "Wow, Who made this" like with other recipes I've taken to work. They were fun to make and did taste good. But nothing special.

These worked well in the press, which I was glad for!  After mixing up all the batter though, I noticed it looked dry and crumbly, so I followed others advice and added 3 tbsp butter.  That made a better consistency.  (I had even added 15 drops green food coloring to the wet ingredients, which made for a pleasing green color when baked.)  I subbed in extra vanilla for the almond, but I thought the flavor was a little salty.  Admittedly I did use salted butter instead of unsalted, which I recently learned is the standard (and assumed in recipes) for baked goods, so that could have been the issue.  Overall a good butter cookie.  My press must make tiny cookies though, because these only took 3 minutes to get brown around the edges.

An excellent spritz cookie recipe! I added a tsp more almond extract for more flavor.

These taste best when there is no browning- 6 minutes creates a melt-in-your-mouth cookie!

No offense but this recipe is incomplete. The mix was way too thick so I had to add two tablespoons of milk to the recipe. Not the best spritz cookie I've had.

Followed the recipe and my cookies came out perfect!  I made the dough the night before and refrigerated.  The next morning I just let it come to room temp. and softened with a hand mixer. I dyed half red/half green and pressed tree's and wreaths. Reminds me of the spritz cookies my mom made back in the 50's.

Loved these!  This was my first time using a cookie press and this recipe did not disappoint.  I did not have almond extract so I subbed grated orange zest and 1 T juice fom the orange.  Mmmmmmmmmm!  I also added 2 more tablespoons of butter.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the butter in the recipe by 2 T, but otherwise left the recipe the sam. Dough was perfect! Finished cookies tasted exactly as they should. I think the 'aftertaste' comments were a result of people's personal preferences--there's no aftertaste in my opinion, just perfect buttery goodness. :)

I made these as written but baked them for 6 minutes, intending to watch the last 2 or 3 minutes.  Unfortunately the bottoms were very brown already.  I'll lower the temp next time.

This recipe was a bit dry. I added a little milk to the dough to increase the moisture and make it easier to use, which really helped. The cookies turned out great! Probably the best Sritz I've ever had!

Follow the recipe exactly and let them fully cool on their baking sheets. They taste awesome the next day. I might add some extra white sugar on top of the confectioner's, next time, since I like sweeter butter cookies.

As good as Grandma used to make. So easy and for the first time ever my cookie press worked wonderfully no problems at all. I did omit the salt as we are salt restricted but they taste great...
This will be my recipe to use from now on.

I have made many different spritz recipes and this was by far my least favorite.  The texture and aftertaste were not great.  I will definitely not be using this recipe again...maybe it is the confectioners' sugar...?

Probably a really rick, crispy cookie.  Unfortunately, the dough was too thick to go through my press.  I tried rolling it out instead, but it fell apart.

This is a great go to for company recipe. Everyone likes a soft yummy butter cookie. And on the off chance someone does not care for them it leaves that much more for you to eat! :D Easy to make, delicious to eat. Cannot go wrong recipe. Watch carefully they burn quickly.

If you are in Canada you might need to use less flour (Canadian flour is "harder" than flour in the US). I used the amount called for in the recipe and the dough was too stiff to put in a cookie press. I made thumb-print cookies out of the dough and the filled the indentation with red sugar. They still tasted good.

Delicious!!! Very simple and quick recipe with a great butter flavor.  Next time however I will triple the batch, I need alot more then 36 cookies when baking for people. I read it as 36 servings thinking it would be enough for 36 people. That's my mistake. This recipe is great and quick.

best spritz recipe i've found yet!  instead of almond extract, i opted for peppermint...very lightly mint flavored, the vanilla with it made it such a good mint flavor, and so buttery...yummy!  if you like peppermint, i'd add a light peppermint frosting on top and add crushed candy canes: 2 TBSP butter softened, 1 1/2 c confectioners sugar, 2 TBSP milk, 1/8 to 1/4 tsp peppermint extract, 2 to 3 drops food coloring if desired, crushed mint candy or candy canes if desired.  in small bowl beat butter until light and fluffy, add other ingredients, beat until smooth, frost cooled cookies and top with crushed candies.

Good cookies. I did reduce the amt of vanilla and almond extracts per other reviewers suggestion.     My cookie press broke so I ended up having to roll and cut these and with small cookie cutters and they rolled and cut great. Thanks

This is the recipe I have been using for years (but out of an old family cookbook.  If you have trouble with the "dough" sticking in your tube, try wrapping a one tube amount of dough in wax paper and chill for an hour. We live in Florida where it is humid year-round (whether it is hot or cold outside) and that helps a bit.

I was a bit disapointed with this recipe. There was just not enough flavor. I had to up the extracts to a couple teaspoons to get the cookies to taste more like cookies. The version I made with peppermint extract was also much better. This cookies i also felt did not hold their shape too well after being baked. I followed all the directions and cooled the baking sheets but the cookies melted too fast i think.

This is a delicious recipe and very easy.  The dough was a bit stiff to pipe or press, so I added a bit of half & half until it was a little less firm. They baked up beautifully.  I actually piped them into 4 inch bars and dipped half of each cookie in chocolate.  Wonderful!

Absolutely the best cookies for a cookie press. The dough is just right and not gooey at all and they are delicious! I'll make this recipe from now on.

Not yummmy as many have indicated...playdough more than cookie dough.  This recipe needs major modifications with the extracts and cooking time in order to gain a better rating :(

I make spritz cookies only once a year for Christmas.This is the one recipe I keep managing to misplace and regretting it when I do. Others are good, but I always know when I've hit the right one. I've saved it to my private collection now so I can finally find it at the last minute, whew!

I wasn't able to get these cookies to work.  The dough was so dry the cookies fell apart the minute they came out of the press.  The raw dough tasted fine, but I wasn't even able to shape them by hand for baking. I think it is the amount of dry ingredients versus wet ingredients that cause the dough to fall apart.

These cookies where so soft that all the shape melted out of them! I live at a normal altitude so I was very confused and sad. They still tasted good, but they looked like blobs. :(

Like the previous reviewers I only used 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract(personal preference.) But this is a very easy to use recipe. Mine turned out perfectly. I liked that you didn't have to refrigerate the dough. These tasted great too!

I have made this recipe a number of times now. I have changed it just a little bit to make it easier to make. I use a whole egg instead of two yolks and use double the vanilla and no almond. They turn out great. Making them with a square press mold I yield about 7 dozen cookies.

Yum! Every year I try a new butter cookie recipe, looking for an amazing one.  Now I found it!  I didnt use almond extract, just doubled the vanilla, and they were great,  melt in your mouth!  next time I will add the almond extract, cause I love that flavor.

I love this recipe!  I made these substituting soy butter for the butter, egg replacer for the eggs, and replaced the almond extract with another 1/2 tsp of vanilla so my egg/dairy/nut-allergic son could eat them, and they were still WONDERFUL! They taste like a bakery cookie and have a nice crisp texture.  Now I make them when I need to take cookies to share and don't even tell anyone about the substitute ingredients.  They also go through the press beautifully.

Great recipe! I followed other reviewers' advice and omitted the almond extract while doubling the vanilla extract and mine turned out wonderful. The dough worked beautifully in my cookie press. Wish I had found this recipe back at Christmas time! Thank you again for posting it. I will definitely make these again and again.

Great flavor! I used a 1/4 c. extra butter like some reviewers suggested and I did not have a problem with running the dough through my press at all. The cookies are what the name says, nice and buttery. Hightly recomended!Thank you!

I give this recipe five stars for FLAVOR!  It couldn't get them to work in my cookie press, but it was my first time, so I just rolled them into balls, put a thumb print on them and some sprinkles.  They taste wonderful: flaky, buttery, and just enough almond flavor without altering the recipe at all.  This is a great basic that I'd recommend to anyone.

I just finished baking these moments ago, I really liked them.  I just bought a new Wilton cookie press and this dough worked fine it it.  I've had other cookie presses and they were cheaper and didn't work well at all.  I couldn't get the handle to work the entire time, but I was able to use the plunger without a problem...I'll just have to practice.  I used a star shaped die and ended up with more than 50 cookies.  I took some advise and used 1 whole egg instead of 2 yokes but kept everything else the same.  Great cookie.  Thanks!

Perfect!  I've been searching for a fabulous spritz recipe for a while, and this is the one.  If you use salted butter, I recommend halving the salt.  I also like to cook them a bit longer, until the tops just brown - best flavor that way, I think.  Thanks!

This recipe was easy to make and work with. I thought the cookies were good but, a bit bland. I want a butter cookie that just melts in your mouth. Over all it is a good recipe, just not as good as I had hoped. I gave it 4 *'s

Thanks for the great recipe!  The flavor and texture of these cookies is just right!  I had never used a cookie press before and was looking for a good recipe, and thankfully I hit on this one.  The dough did turn out very stiff, and the only 'shape' that didn't turn out too well because of the stiffness was the christmas tree shape.  Otherwise, perfect!

The best spritz cookie I ever made!  I did make  2 tiny changes.  I used 1 egg yolk and 1 egg.  I also baked them at 350.  400 just sounded too hot for me.  I got married in 1962 and my cookie press is from that era,  copper top and bottom with a silver tube.  I have found that when I make “heirloom” recipes,  I do not use my mixer.  Those recipes come from a time when many cooks didn’t have an electric mixer,  so the good old strong right arm and a wooden spoon is put to work.  I also split the dough and colored one half green and the other half pink.  I used the heart disk first because it’s the easiest one to press out.  I made trees with the green.  I don’t know about newer cookie presses,  but my discs are all numbered.  I put that number side up so I can see it.    I’m not sure whether anything I wrote here will help anyone who wants to make these cookies.  This was my 26th year of making Christmas cookies and I’ve NEVER had better spritz cookies.  It a real keeper!

First one I've made that I didn't have to keep chilling to make it work with the cookie press! The only changes I made were that I used 1/2C and 2T of powdered sugar, and 1/2C and 2T of sugar; then I only used vanilla so I used 1 1/2tsp of that.  Made me 8 dozen!
My son said they were all gone before he had a chance to have one at class holiday party! Good thing I made more :)

This is my first review after a few years on this site. I really liked this cookie recipe. I adjusted to 72 servings. I DID listen to another reviewer and add 1/4c more butter, for ease of press, as it was my first time using a press as well.

When I make mine, I make 4 batches.  I  put red coloring in one, blue in the next, green in the next and yellow in the last one.  Then I take a little from each color fill my press and away I go.  Everyone loves the mulit colors.  I put colored sugar on some, and also put crushed candy canes on some.  YUMMY

I followed the recipe exact except omitted the flavorings and added Amaretto instead.  What a mess.  Did not hold shape at all.  So added some more powdered sugar still no hold.  Will not be using this again

I have been baking Spritz for over 50 years and have just now found the perfect recipe.  I add 2tbl extra butter as some previous reviewer suggested.   I know almond is the traditional flavor for Spritz but sometimes I use lemon or just more vanilla.  They work beautifully in my press, hold their shape when baked and the taste and texture are perfect.  I am a very happy baker.  Thank you to Sheri .

I liked the flavor, but it was too solid for my cookie press. I used another recipe and the press worked.

I've made spritz for years, and used this recipe for the first time.  The dough was too stiff and didn't work well in the cookie press.  I doubled the recipe, and wound up throwing it all away.  It probably needed less flour, or more butter.

I agree with many others. Cookie has a very unappealing taste. It was also to think to go thru my cookie press.  After a while I gave up and made them like sugar cookies that are rolled in balls.  Even dipping them in coloured sugars didn't give them enough flavour.  They will not make the gift boxes.

I made little wreths for Christmas. I used pastry bag instead of cookie press. The dough was too thick, it was difficult to get it out. So I added few spoons of sour cream to thin it. It worked better. So I think, I would add less flour next time.

I did not care for this recipe. They taste OK BUT they were too soft to get them to go through the press so I chilled the dough, finally had to add more flour. Then they ended up doughy/cakey.

I was extremely disappointed in the results. 

On the positive side: the cookies were easy to make and very easy to press out.  I would give 5 stars for easy of prep.

This recipe was just ok. I'm not a huge sweets fan but even I thought that it could use more sugar.  Next time I will sub out 1/4 cup of flour and add more sugar in its place.  My first batch got too dark so I turned down my oven to 350 and baked them for 7 minutes.  
The consistency is very nice. Slightly crisp and light in the middle. Great butter taste.

This recipe uses way too much flour to make a dough. I will add more of the other ingredients to stretch it and make it usable. Right now all I have is crumbles of floury nothingness.

So I tried the recipe their way and the cookies were not very good. Basically if you change these few things they should work. First cut the sugar to one cup. Also cut down the almond extract and salt in half. Also use just one whole egg and add 1 tbsp milk. It works for me. :)

Five stars!  First spritz cookie I've made that doesn't 'act up' in the press or on the cookie sheet.  Flavorful, forgiving, and fast.

Followed advice on adding extra 2 tbs of butter.  Perfect.

I have made this recipe several times, in my search to reproduce the Italian Butter Cookies available in bulk at bakeries around Chicago. This comes very very close to it.  This is a very simple recipe, quality ingredients give a quality result.   Adjust your salt down if you use salted butter.  I also skip the almond extract, just a taste preference.  But I use a very good quality organic pure vanilla extract, cheap imitation vanilla would be telling and probably accounts for the aftertaste some reviewers experienced.  The texture is usually perfect for my cheap Wilton cookie press, but one time I had to put it back in the mixer and add some liquid, it was too crumbly. The weather had been particularly dry, and I think that affected it a bit.   You have to use plain aluminum cookie sheets, and no parchment paper, unless you want a fight to get them to press out effeciently.   They are wonderful dipped in dipped partially in the "Make Your Own Almond Bark" chocolate candy coating and toss on a few seasonally appropriate sprinkles. They come very close to the Italian cookies from home.

Very tasty but I did go a little light on both flavorings because of some other reviewers. Maybe didn't need to since I only use Watkins flavorings which are hard to beat. I did find the dough a little stiff to go thru the press. Had a little better luck with another recipe on this site. Probably should try it again and just add a tad more butter and even try the full amount of flavorings.

This is the best! I've tried several recipes over the years. This is wonderful. I did not have almond extract so I used lemon extract. I, also, took another reviewers suggestion and reduced the salt and extract (lemon for me)by 1/2, added 2 tablespoonfuls of butter and reduced the vanilla extract to 1/4 tsp. Yum!

The cookie dough did not want to come out of my electric cookie press.  I added some of the egg whites and another 1/2 yolk.  After all that, the taste was bland.......the search goes on. Maybe I should have added more butter like other reviewers have suggested.

The cookies were tasty enough, but the dough was very difficult to work with. The biggest problem, however, was that the cookie dough spread out and lost its shape as it baked. My Christmas trees looked like blobs. I make cookie press or "spritz" cookies every year, but from a similar recipe that uses regular white granulated sugar instead of confectioner's sugar. That's the only explanation I can think of, but I'll never make this recipe again.

Absolutely delicious!
I omitted the almond extract and following other reviews, added more butter but just about 1 tablespoon more. 
I've been searching for years for the perfect Spritz recipe and I have finally found it!

I tried this recipe today with my cookie press. I finally learned how to operate it properly and these cookies turned out great.  The dough was just the right consistency and went through easily.  I did not have almond extract and used all vanilla.  My butter was salted and I still added the pinch of salt and did not find them to be too salty.  They were buttery and delicious. I will use this recipe going forward.

I have tried spritz cookies before, but always with not great results. This recipe turned out great, the only change I made was to omit almond extract after reading some reviews. I LOVE Vanilla, may be next time I'll add more of it! This yielded about 5 dozen cookies for me.

Love these, although I thought they needed to be a little sweeter so I topped them with a recipe for 'Sugar Cookie Icing'. They were great after that.

Yummy and very easy...had to make two batches!  The first one I added 2 additional tablespoons of butter after I had everything mixed, the second was just fine...probably my accurate measuring...LOL.  Had one dark cookie sheet and one bright aluminum so I baked them at 375 and that worked great (5 min. on dark & 6 min. on bright). I like to have a sheet loaded and ready to put into the oven when the baked sheet comes out so, I made do with what I had.  Also, used Mexican white vanilla and no almond extract. I washed the sheets after each trip through the oven.  Happy baking!

Made this cookies and they turned out so delicious that I will be making these for years to come.  I did end up not adding the last 1/4 cup of the flour mixture and the consistency for the cookie press was perfect.

WARNING: Do not bake at 400! I don't know what I was thinking following that, the bottoms started turning brown while the tops were uncooked. They do also blob out of shape as another reviewer said, my Christmas trees look more like leaves. As far as taste, yes they taste good, verrrry buttery, as the name states. Maybe baking at 350 would solve the blobbing out of shape as well, not sure, but probably not.

Read the rest of the reviews and couldn't believe it! they TASTE good, but, since these are spritz cookies, I had to give them a two. Every shape I did looked like a blob, even after refrigeration on a cold cookie sheet. Every single one......I know I got the recipe right. Doubled it, but that should not have been a problem.

This is very similar to the recipe my mother used for  50 years. I may suggest using half butter and half Crisco and dropping the almond extract.

I do a couple of other things also but they are personal adventures. lol This recipe can be manipulated in many ways--  Have fun!

My 3yr old daughter & I just made these. The only thing I did differently was I used margarine instead of butter, because I am out of butter & didn't want to run to the store. I used our Cookie Pro Ultra II to press them onto the baking sheets. I baked them at 350 for 8min & they turned out absolutely PERFECT. They are light & airy & soft & have a gorgeous flavor. This is definitely one for the recipe book!

I also thought that this needed extra butter for my cookie press.  I reduced the vanilla to 1/2 t and they turned out great.  I would recommend frosting tints to color them rather than food coloring.

Followed instructions omitting the almond extract (didn't have), this recipe didn't go through my Pampered Chef cookie press, had to make round cookies, not as pretty. Will not be using this one again. Found the recipe that came with the press.

Way too dry for the press, and after you spend the time fighting to get something on the cookie sheet...they come out bland and unappetizing.  Wouldn't use this recipe.

I thought these were delicious, however I also had trouble with it being a bit too dry for the cookie press.  
I wound up using the saw tooth disc and made some raspberry jelly filled cookie sandwiches... yummy!

Maybe even 4 1/2 stars!  I followed the recipe, reducing the vanilla to 1/2 t. and keeping the almond at 1/2 t.  I added food coloring to portions to make some red and some green (keeping some natural) to make Christmas cookies (trees, wreaths, flowers, etc.).  I also set the oven to 375 instead of 400 degrees (which is what my other spritz recipes say). In 7 minutes, they were cooked perfectly. I might try what some other reviewers suggested and put in a couple more teaspoons of butter.  Also, I used one stick salted butter and the other unsalted.

I made these with the recommended modifications: i2TBS extra butter, only 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and a dash more of the vanilla. Turned out perfect! Came out of the press easily and tasted fantastic.

These cookies were a HIT! I'm a first time baker of anything and had no problem with making these out of a cookie press AND they tasted AWESOME! I did use 2 more tablespoons of butter and only 2 teaspoons of Vanilla Extract like others mentioned.

smooth texture.  I omitted the almond extract and added more vanilla.  It came out my cookie press just fine.  These remind me of vanilla cookies my mother used to bake when I was young.  I'm sure you could add other extracts to vary up the flavors.. overall a very tasty, light smooth vanilla cookie. thanks to sheri for the recipe!

This was a very delicious recipe!  My husband said it is the best one he's ever tasted.  I followed the recipe but I used 1 whole egg instead of yolk and a little more butter.  Worked excellent in the cookie press.  I honestly had a wonderful baking experience with this recipe!  Thank you!  It does help to chill the baking pans before pressing cookies on them and I didn't need to chill the dough at all.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Turned out very well. Used Smart Balance instead of butter (to make them milk free) and did 1 tsp of almond extract to make up for the lack of buttery flavor. Turned out great...soft on the inside and a little on the outside.

I'm going to give this recipe 5 stars, even though my cookies only turned out so-so.  The cookies tasted GREAT and the consistency was fanstastic, but my cookie press is a piece of junk and broke most of the cookies.  Moral of the story - buy a good cookie press!!!

Yummy fun!  My first time making these and I used this recipe knowing it would turn out delicious.  My husband didn't know he'd be helping but after mashing the butter he had a blast using the gun!

The taste is delicious, plus they went through the cookie press perfectly. I mean, perfectly. I used room temperature unsalted butter, and put the dough through the press right away.

Love the taste of the cookies. I have a hard time with spritz cookies and have to keep putting in the fridge to be able to get it to come out of the press okay. I love the taste of these though. They went first at Christmas.

This recipe is Excellent, easy to work with and needs no chilling. I did find out you need to use a clean cookie sheet for each pan you bake, otherwise they won't come off the press. I even used my "old school" cookie press and they turned out great!

These are wonderful!  The perfect consistency, soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside.  I replaced the almond with peppermint extract and it gives them a little something different.  These are so much better than the ones that came with the spritzer!

Fabulous recipe.  I followed the recipe as is and it was wonderful.  Reminds me of the ones my grandmother used to make for me.  The dough was the right consistency for the press.

Excellent!  This is my first attempt at spritz, and so much easier than I remember from growing up!  These taste great.  Tip, if you add food coloring you may need to add more flour as well! :D  Happy cookie baking!  These are delicious!

I made a different recipe last night and I was able to roll out the dough and use a cookie cutter...For this recipe you must use a cookie press (my luck, I dont own one so I had to manually make the shapes.) I liked working with the other dough better but this dough has a much better taste. I followed the recipe exact but without the almond. Would try again..watch the oven.

Yummy! I added a couple tablespoons of extra butter as other reviewers suggested and these worked out perfectly.  Easy to press and very tasty.  Now let's hope my kid's think so too when they get home from school. :)

I made this recipe AS IS except for using an entire egg instead of 2 yolks. The cookies taste fine but I'm not impressed with the results of the press. I doubt I'll make these again, unless it is as ball cookies with a thumb=print pressing them. I was impressed at how closely they taste like my husband's favorite store-bought butter cookies. I wouldn't suggest emitting or decreasing the almond as others have done. It's a perfect amount!

These are amazingly good!  I loved the almond taste and was surprised to read the comments by reviewers stating that they had left out the almond extract. These cookies will be a new Christmas tradition at my house. I made this recipe as written and didn't change a thing.

I haven’t made spritz cookies in over 30 years and as I remember, it was always hit and miss if the dough was going to cooperate.  Feeling nostalgic, I got a new press and  every cookie in my first batch was a struggle, so I tried this recipe which was essentially the same only with powdered sugar instead of granulated.  Don't know if it was the recipe, me getting used to the press or just luck of the draw, but I had much more success.  I did freeze the pans first, and that appeared to help the pans "grab" the dough. And I added just a tad extra (tbls?) of butter since I'm in a dry climate.  Made a huge batch of impressive cookies.  Will turn this into my go to recipe!

I didn't alter the recipe, they were delicious.  Make sure you sift the flour when measuring out...maybe that's why so many had a "tough" dough.  That's an important step.

I followed the recipe exactly and the dough wouldn’t come together.  It looked like sand.  Had to add  couple tbs of milk to get the right consistency so I could use the press. Not a fan of  the flavor either.    I plan on trying a version with regular sugar next instead of the powdered as in this recipe.

I really don't understand the positive reviews for this recipe.  I followed it to the letter measuring everything.  The dough was so stiff that I thought it was going to break my cookie press!  It wouldn't go through at all!  After I pried it out of the press, I tried adding some milk as one reviewer had suggested, but ended up adding too much making the dough too mushy.  I had to throw out the dough.  I finally switched to the Snowflake recipe and it worked out perfectly.

Cookies are tasty and worked pretty well in my cookie press, the Sawa 2000.  I did, however, decide I need a new cookie press.

These cookies are good.  I used my cookie press on the majority of them.  I'm not great at the cookie press, but quite a few turned out cute.  Once I was tired of using it, I started rolling the cookies into a small ball.  When the ball cookies came out of the oven, I coated them with powdered sugar.  They were also excellent.  Overall, this is a very good basic cookie with a nice, light almond flavor.  6 min was the perfect cooking time.

This is definitely a keeper. I did add a T more butter; the dough was a bit too stiff to go through the press. I also omitted the almond extract; I just don't like the taste! The cookies were very light and buttery tasting. I will definitely be making these again.

I have been making spritz cookies for over 20 years, using different recipes.  This one was extremely easy to use in the cookie press, while some are very difficult.  I read the other reviews, and omitted the almond extract.  I am surprise to hear of complaints about "after taste" because I did not experience that.  But, I always use pure vanilla extract.  My only tweak for next time would be to reduce or even omit the salt.  I used unsalted butter, so did not think it was an issue, but I noticed a rather salty taste with the 1/2 t.  I would back it off to 1/4 t. next time.  Enjoy, they bake up very pretty!

I made this recipe as directed for Christmas cookies. I thought they were fantastic. My husband was not a fan of the almond flavor, but that was okay. More for everyone else. The dough was very stiff after working with it. I had difficulty getting it through my press. My cookies didn't come out with the intended pattern. They were still pretty scrumptious, and I will make them again.

The flavor was fine, but they were very crumbly and didn't stick to my cold cookie sheet out of the press.  My family and I like the Wilton recipe better.  I won't make this one again.

I followed other's suggestions.  What worked best for me was adding ONE extra tablespoon of butter instead of two.  My dough was the perfect consistency.  Not sure if the additional butter did the trick or the new cookie press that I finally got.  All I know that after years of failure, this year my spritz cookies turned out perfectly!!!!

This is the best spritz recipe I've found. I did substitute the almond flavoring with 1/4 tsp of rum extract. It really helped boost the vanilla  and buttery flavors. Using a larger cookie press, that makes a 2 1/2 in cookie, the recipe makes 3 doz cookies. Cook time 7-8 minutes. It's a keeper!!

Good recipe, I  added 2 Tbsp butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond. I think the reason some reviews complain of aftertaste and some don't could be due to the type of extract used- in a recipe like this you need the best quality extract- doesn't necessarily have to be specially ordered- McCormick's pure vanilla was the highest rated by America's Test Kitchen.  Don't need to chill dough but put your cookie sheets in the freezer and spritz cookies directly on it. Don't re-use cookie sheets without chilling first and you will get great cookies. Only gave 4 stars because had to add more butter- with the addition it's 5 stars.

These were wonderful! The flavor was delicious. We kept the almond extract as instructed in the recipe (despite others reviews). We added about 1/4 cup butter. They were the hit of the holiday baking party.

After reading the reviews here I added two tablespoons extra butter and shorted the almond and vanilla extracts, as well as the salt.  They turned out FANTASTIC!  Delicious, buttery, and pretty.  It was my first time making these and first time using a cookie press and it was really easy.  I'll definitely be making these every year going forward.

Oh, for a peppermint twist I added (in addition to the vanilla and almond extracts) a tsp or two of peppermint extract and some green gel food coloring.  Then I tempered some chocolate and drizzled it over the cookies.  Delish!

dough was much to stiff to force through a cookie press. The cookies tasted great but they looked like blobs of green rather than petite Christmas trees.

These were very light and tasty... only made a couple of slight changes after making the original recipe. I changed the sugar to 3/4 C Powdered and 3/4 C Granulated Sugar, changed egg to 1 whole egg and added 1/2 tsp Baking Soda and 1/2 tsp Creme of Tarter. Came out moist in the middle, and melt in your mouth good!! :)

I always read the reviews before I start a recipe. I decided  to omit the almond extract because some said it made it bitter and increase the vanilla extract alittle. For some I rolled into ball and once they came out of the oven  topped with Hershey kisses. They tasted just like the black and white cookies that I love. I will keep this just to make those

I followed the directions to the T! They came out perfectly with my Wilton cookie press!! Cookies look GREAT! But they taste like playdoh ... They weren't edible! We used them to decorate our gingerbread houses :/

I followed this except I didn't add the almond extract. This did not turn out. The dough kept sticking to the press and not the pan. I ended up rolling the dough and used cookie cutters. The cookies did taste good but I was disappointed that I couldn't use my press. This was my first attempt at making press cookies.

Had to alter the recipe - it was too dry! I could not put the cookies through the cookie press.  So I added two tablespoons of whole milk and it was perfect.  Nice delicate taste.  Cooked in exactly 6 minutes and 30 seconds.

The dough was crumbly, forget putting them through the press.  I added some milk and ended up rolling them out.

My daughter and I just made these and they're DELICIOUS! The dough was a bit stiff for my press so I had to add about a tablespoon of milk to the batter, but the flavor is spot on! We topped them with colored sugar before baking and they were perfectly baked at 7 minutes. This one's going in my Christmas cookie folder.

This is like my late mom's recipe except for one glaring difference. Hers uses 2 T peanut butter to get that glide-thru-the-press consistency we all want. Blends beautifully with the almond for a pleasant flavor and neither is overbearing

This recipe was good enough for me even as is.  Although I could probably tweak it, I didn't find the flavor overwhelming.  I like to use candied cherries or colored sugar as a topping and that makes them visually appealing.  My go-to recipe for spritz.  I also don't chill as some people recommend.  Being softer makes the dough stick to the pan when I'm extruding with the cookie press.

My 12 year old daughter made the recipe as is and it was very good. Tastes like the butter cookies in the tin. Best spritz cookie that we have tried so far. We will make this one again next year.

Very difficult to get through the cookie press.  Got a few with a lot of effort but ended up throwing the dough out.  To me these should be an easy cookie to make and they were dry an crumbly.  The few I did get through and bake tasted good.  Just too much work for a spritz cookie.

These are what I remember as a child how Spritz cookies taste.  I put a smidgen less than  1/2 tsp of Almond Extract that's called for.  Added vanilla as the recipe stated.  These turned out great while using my new OXO Cookie Press.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

I made these cookies with 1 small substitution since I am not crazy about almond extract I used all vanilla. They tasted great and were a big hit. I made a glaze from confection sugar and orange juice added a bit of food color and sprinkles to dress them up.

I don't know what aftertaste some people are talking about. I accidentally added a little more almond extract than called for, but I liked the flavor anyway, and my husband gobbled them up and said they were as good as his mom's. Cook times were much lower for me - even at 4.5 min the bottoms were over baked.

I tweaked the recipe just like one reviewer (trish44) did, and the only "negative" thing I can say about the spritz cookies is that they are sooooooo addictive! I'm excited to bake more to give to friends.

Been making spritz 35 years and I try new recipes every year and this is by far THE BEST! So buttery and light! Easy to use out of the cookie press. I have the old fashioned hand twist kind!

Terrific, cut back on the flavoring, and use only real vanilla and almond extract.

The dough was very dry and was hard to use in a cookie press. I'd choose one of the other recipes that have the cream cheese in them. They were kind of bland and dry.

This is an okay recipe. I expected more buttery shortbread taste and these don't deliver on that.  Would look good on a cookie tray, but that's it for me.

This dough was easy to work with, but I felt it didn't have much flavor.  Kind of doughy tasting.  Maybe I'm spoiled by Grandma's recipe.

I made this cookie & the "butter snow flakes" from this site I liked the other cookie better this is a drier cookie and I had a problem with the dough coming out of the pampered chef cookie press.  Make sure you watch bake time they brown quickly.   Thanks
