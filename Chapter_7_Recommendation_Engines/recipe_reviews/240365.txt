Made this in about an hour - NOT as a crockpot dish and it was a huge hit. I boiled the cubed sweet potatoes. As they were cooking, I did the turkey sausage (in my case I took off the skin, sautéed and broke them into pieces).  In a large pot I added the beans, tomatoes, beef broth and the turkey sausage and spices. When the sweet potatoes were ready, I drained them add gently folded them into the pot. Let that cook for about 20 to 25 minutes for the flavors to meld. Wonderful results. Wow.

This was a nice change from traditional chili. On my second helping I added brown sugar to sweeten it up and it was good either way.

4/25/2016 I made this again but this time I did not cooked it in a slow cooker.  I also added corn and half a can of crushed pineapple. I must say it turned out awesome!

I am a novice cook and I stuck to the recipe. It turned out great. I also felt good after eating it, with energy enough to teach 2nd graders! ;) I also tried the non-crockpot version, as suggested by another reviewer, before I had a crockpot. That turned out nicely, as well.

It was just ok,  it tasted like my regular chili but with chuncks of sweet potato in it. Wouldn't make it again.

This is a good recipe but I did make some changes.  I used sweet Italian turkey sausages which I removed from the casings and browned breaking them into crumbles.  I also sauteed an onion along with 2 cloves of garlic.  I reduced the broth to half (1 1/2 cups of chicken broth) because 3 cups would have been too soupy.  I omitted the diced tomatoes and just used the 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes.  It is not necessary to precook the sweet potatoes.  They will cook in the chili.  I simmered it on top of the stove rather than using a slow cooker.  Served topped with shredded Mexican blend cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips.

I thought this was really good! I did chop 1 1/2 yellow onions, saute them and add them to the chili, used an extra can of black beans, and some extra chili powder, cumin and added minced garlic.  Added more sweet potato, too, because I had it on hand.
2nd time I made it I used some tomatoes that were chili ready and also with garlic and onions. Also added some sauteed red peppers.

I made this recipe without the cumin (because I didn't have any) and I served it over rice.  Will be making it again :)

Great recipe and a nice change for a cold night. It’s very easy to make and just let simmer for the afternoon. I made this exactly as written and it was delicious. Next time I may try adding more sausage and some garlic powder.

Turned out a little soupy because of the 3 cups of broth. Next time I make this, I would probably double the beans and Italian sausage to make it less dilute.

Made it exactly as written and it was wonderful.  Not a big fan of "chili", but loved this and the family did too!

I gave this 4 stars because I had to substitute some ingredients due to what was in my pantry. I used deep brown beans and 1/2 cup of lentils (for black beans), chicken stock (instead of beef) and did not use crushed tomatoes. I also added corn and boiled the sweet potato as another reviewer suggested, so I could cook it on top of the stove. I resisted adding sautéed onion as I normally would. I know it seems like I changed a lot, but the basic recipe was the same. The flavour was great, not to spicy with the sweetness from the potato, a nice change from regular chilli. I served with cheese biscuits.

This was awesome! Definitely a delicious "spin" on traditional chili. I made it exactly as the recipe states. Also made some sweet potato biscuits to go with it-yum!
