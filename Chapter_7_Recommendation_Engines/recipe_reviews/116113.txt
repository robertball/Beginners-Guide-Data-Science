I searched the recipe so I could make this again and could not believe the poor reviews that I read. So I decided to write my own. This meal is excellent, safe, and simple to prepare. My 2 and 5 year old love it. I recommend using fresh ginger and pineapple, as well as dark corn syrup. And make a pot of rice. And I agree with a previous reviewer, a pot of rice compliments the chicken really well.

We really enjoyed this one!  I used thighs instead of legs and put in green peppers and big chunks of red onion. The sauce was a bit watery but will try to put in some cornstarch next time.  Thighs were really tender and will use them again next time- will definately make it again. Even my picky eaters ate up every bite! Very yummy!!!

My husband and I have never baked chicken before and this recipe was easy to follow. We made some changs based off of the reviews. We used dark corn syrup and added pepper, onions, brown sugar and extra ground ginger.  We put crushed pineapples in the sauce and pineapple slices on top the chicken. We added the brown sugar to the mixture and also sprinkled it on top of the pineapple slices. It was so good! The chicken was very moist and the flavor went throughout the entire chicken. We used drumsticks and thighs and had to bake it for an extra 15 minutes. Our sauce didn't thicken either, but it was good mixed with the peppers and onions and poured over rice. This is definitely a new favorite for us!

I thought this was VERY good.....after I made some adjustments. I marinated legs and thighs in teriyaki the night before. I substituted fresh minced ginger for the powdered. Added chopped onion and garlic. Omitted the corn oil. Once done baking, I removed the chicken, poured the sauce into a pan, added cornstarch and reduced. Served with brown rice and drizzled the sauce over top of chicken. My boyfriend asked me to please make this again!

I found this a very easy recipe to make.  I made some changes to it and it turned out very flavourful!  I used fresh ginger and also added some fresh garlic.  The ingredient that I added that made it so yummy was some Thai sweet chili sauce.  I added just under 1/4 cup.  I cooked it covered in a dish for 45 min then took the cover off and broiled it for 15 minutes on both sides to brown the chicken.  Serve it with rice so the sauce can be soaked up.

What a dissappointment it was sitting down to eat this thing at dinner. Tasteless. It lacked flavour and taste. Bland. After having read the other two reviews, I had decided to alter it. I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic, doubled the soya and ginger and corn syrup but it did not do much. I think it would be better with sweetened canned pineapple bits (I had used the unsweetened pineaplle)and half of its juice and instead of cornsyrup, brown sugar making it a better possibility of it caramelizing. Good Luck to you brave ones that will try it out.

I didn't care for this either.  I used ground ginger and it didn't make any difference.  My leg quarters were still a bit frozen, so it took longer to cook, but it had too much liquid and didn't carmelize at all.

LOVED this.  Added 1/2 large green pepper, 1 large sweet onion, 2 tbsp dark br sugar, 2 tsp fresh ginger, used dark syrup as suggested & 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  Cooked as suggested, then increased oven time to 385 & cooked an addl 20-30 to brown the skin & reduce the liquid.  No stove-top reduction reqd.  Wonderful flavor.  As is, I'd rate this a 3; w/ changes, a 5.

I was really disappointed with this, the flavors sounded good but the end product just tasted like greasy bland chicken.

This was pretty good but I was hoping it would be a little more flavorful. Instead of corn syrup I used honey and added chili paste for that kick.  Im not giving up on it yet I know it could be a good summer dish. Possibly even served cold after cooked but it needs more flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly with no subsitions.  It was rather greasy due to the fat cooking off of the legs.  The sauce, which smelled great before cooking, cooked down and once mixed with skin fat was a bit bland.  The chicken was very tender and juicy, but I wish there was a way to of made that wonderful pre-baked flavor of the sauce stay.   I'm no expert at cooking but I think next time perhaps I'll cook this with skinless chicken and add some brown sugar and corn starch to sweeten and thicken it a bit.

This is a good sweet and sour type of recipe for chicken, it will not caramelize because it is not supposed to (it is not a glaze either).  I put onions it also.  My family loves it and my two girls ask for seconds.  We always have rice with this.

We love the flavor of this dish, but it never comes out "sticky" as I expect. I've even tried doubling the corn syrup and eliminating the juice from the pineapple, but there's still too much liquid.

The reviews seemed so mixed on this that I was intrigued and thought I'd give it a try, especially since it looked similar to a sweet and sour chicken recipe that is a big hit with my husband.  It wasn't terrible, but next time I will stick with the sweet and sour chicken.  I omitted the corn oil, as it did not seem necessary (glad I did, I didn't miss it at all) and added @ 1/4 cup thai sweet chile sauce as another reviewer recommended.  I can see why folks might want to add cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.  I found that with the sauce as thin as it was, even though it tasted good over rice, the chicken itself was very bland.  I did reduce the sauce in a frying pan after cooking the chicken, and that helped a bit.  If I were to make this again, I'd probably marinate the drumsticks first so they would have more flavor.  I don't think I will be making this again though.  It just wasn't that great.

This very easy..but after reading some of the reviews was afraid of bland chicken. I ended up marinating my chicken thighs in the sauce for about an hour while I got the kids ready for bed. Not sure why you would need so much oil and would leave that out next time and just brush chicken with oil and maybe baste 1/2 way through w/sauce. I also added a touch of brown sugar but wasn't satisfied, so I added some Mirin. That made a big difference and tied everything together! I would make this again in a quick dinner situation!

I did not care for this recipe. I even made adjustments that other reviewers offered.  So bland with clearly no hint of any of the ingredients I added.  The oven fairy whisked them away.

This was an okay recipe.  It is bland.  I made it according to the recipe and it is lacking.  Next time I will add some garlic and onion powder and maybe some cut up ones as well.  It makes a lovely gravy but still....no taste.  I will make this again but I will tweek it some.

This is one of the best meals I've had in quite some time!  Absolutely DIVINE!   I did have to modify the recipe a little bit though.  I didnt have any ginger or soy sauce or lemon juice, so I omitted all those things.  I took only 3 chicken Drumsticks and put them into a glass baking dish.   I added 1/8 cup vegtable oil, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 - 8 oz can of unsweetened crushed pinneapple (without draining).   Since I didnt have the ginger or the soy sauce or the lemon juice, I sprinkled the chicken with 2 tablespoons MS Dash Butter Flavored seasoning.   I made mashed potatoes with real butter and a steamed veggie mix for side dishes and I was in heaven after this cooked.

I really liked this dish.  I didn't have corn syrup so I substituted 3 Tbsp of unstarched molasses instead.  I used fresh ginger and added a chopped small yellow onion to the dish.  I used a whole can of crushed pineapple, which was 20 ozs.  This was tasty and easy.  Will definitely make it again using molasses. I served this dish over brown rice.

Loved it!  Had a small, fresh pineapple and crushed half of it, which was about 8oz, then chopped the other half to add to the chicken.  Also had a bunch of bell peppers that needed to be used up, so added a few red, orange, and yellow to the sauce.   Substituted honey for the corn syrup, omitted the oil, added 1/2t black pepper and a crushed clove of garlic, only used a small amount of seasoned salt, and used grated, fresh ginger.  Marinated the chicken in the sauce for a couple hours, then baked for an hour (did not flip).  The chicken came out perfectly tender and juicy, with some nice browning on the skin.  The sauce did not thicken up, but got watery from all the chicken juices; still good with chicken and some rice on the side. Children to adults all enjoyed this chicken and the recipe is a keeper!

I too was surprised at how bland this turned out! I made it w/ listed the listed ingredients w/ exception of added sriracha hot sauce and brown sugar, omitting the oil all together (which was a good thing -- it wasn't needed). I then marinated it instead of baking right away. I only had a few hours, but it would be good to marinate overnight. I baked everything together in a covered deep dish baker for 1 hour... big chicken pieces. The sauce was very watery and the chicken sadly ugly and pale. I left in the oven uncovered for 15 more minutes to try to get some color... again, not long enough as I was afraid to dry out the meat. After letting it rest a few minutes, I peeled the skin off and cut the meat off the bone for my kids. Again, per someone else's review, I put the sauce in a pan and reduced it down... surprisingly still needed to add a pinch of salt. I added some leftover pineapple chunks which gave it back a bit of tanginess. Then I remembered I had some cilantro in the fridge and added it last to the sauce and pineapple. I added the sauce to the bite-sized meat and it salvaged an otherwise bland baked chicken recipe. Next time I think I'll try the marinade again for a longer period and then bake or grill w/o the pineapple marinade. I'll too it with a pineapple salsa with cilantro, fresh ginger and a little red onion.

We wanted something different and tried this recipe.  I followed all the igredients exactly, except i prepared the sauce and poured on chicken this morning and put in fridge, then baked for supper tonight.  Had to add additional 30 minutes.  Hubby said very good. I guess by marinating the flavors were in the meat it was really good.  Thanks this one is a keeper.

Something was way off in this recipe.  Sauce did not thicken and chicken was not done even after raising oven temp to 400 degrees.  I will NOT do this recipe again.

2 stars for the ease of the recipe, but really no flavor at all.

This was bland....no flavor....needs more sweetness... and I felt like I was drinking corn oil when I was eating the sauce...I would honestly say this should not even a recipe...it is a flavorless group of ingredients to put chicken in

Didn’t really like this. It was an unusual flavour and the chicken didn’t caramelize like I thought it would. I used fresh ginger instead of powder so that may have made a difference.

Loved this recipe. Made it just liked it said and it came out perfect. I did add cornstarch to thicken it up though.

I thought recipe was easy to follow. I enjoyed it but my 6 children felt it was a little blan.  When I make it again I will use one can crushed pineapple and one can of diced. I will also spice it up a little.

I was not pleased with how this recipe turned out. I cut the recipe in half and intended to use 5 leg quarters,  but when I opened the package, they just didn't smell right. So I used 2 large chicken breasts, the only other chicken I had. While the chicken did have a pineapple flavor, the "sauce," if you can call it that, was grainy and not enough to even put over the chicken and rice. I even added more pineapple at the end, hoping that would help, but it didn't. I ended up making Sweet and Sour Sauce I to put over the chicken and rice. That is the only thing that salvaged this recipe. I would definitely make another pineapple chicken recipe next time.

This was awesome!!!! I used chicken stock insteak of oil. and i cooked the chicken legs and thighs in the slow cooker on high for 2 hours. Also, I reduced some of the liquid from the slow cooker after it was done, to top the chicken with more of a glaze... SSo Delicious.
