Delish! As I disdain the flavor, texture and appearance of sun-dried tomatoes, I substituted a half can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion (drained). I also was a bit surprised that this was more of a relish than a smooth dip, so I stirred the mixture until the beans were a bit more broken down. One last note: Adding a packet of Goya cilantro and tomato seasoning makes everything Latin taste that much better. :)

I am sitting here with a tummy full of this dip and chips.  I live alone and made it for my supper. Black beans are healthy and delicious.  I substituted sundried red peppers for the tomatoes, because I did not have tomatoes.  It was quick, healthy and absolutely satisfying.  I am taking some to work tomorrow because I love it so much.

Really good! The only thing I would change next time would be to not drain the whole can of beans. It's a bit dry, even with the cheese & olive oil. I also love spicy things, so I added cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp hot sauce. I'll be making this again!

While this tasted very good, it is not a smooth dip. I mashed the black beans as I made it. I reheated it after it had cooled and it got too dry! Inexperience on my part I am sure. Thanks!

I made this for a girls get together tonight and really enjoyed it. I substituted the sundried tomatoes for half a can of rotel tomatoes and green chiles, and I also sauteed some chopped onion with the garlic. I didn't have any cheese so I left it off, but it was quite good without it. This is a nice, healthy dip recipe to keep on hand. Thanks!

Excellent! I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of stewed tomatoes. Quick, easy and delicious!

I made this last night and it is addicting! The only thing I did differently was double the garlic and added a little bit more cheese which I mixed into the corn and black beas. 
Thanks for a great recipe!!

I just made this and I cannot believe how delicious it is... I was a little skeptical of the simple ingredients involved, but the sun-dried tomatoes really make the whole thing unbelievable. I love it!

Meh.  I thought it was just okay.  BUT it might have been from the taste of the sun-dried toms.  Maybe I'm not a fan of those?  ;)

Tasty and great with chips. I would chopped the sundried by hand. I put all the ingredients in a food processor to make a puree and then heated on the stove with some olive oil, topped it with cheese and heated in the oven. I had left overs and thought it was even better the next day.

I used this recipe to make black bean salsa, minus the cheese.  Is wonderful warm or cold, served as a dip or filling for quesadillas.  I used canned diced tomatoes, not sun-dried, with green chili's to add flavor.  Also added a bit of red pepper and paprika. Much cheaper to make if you cook a bag of dried black beans and double everything else. REALLY good with diced avocado and sour cream. :o)

I thought this was great...I made some variations however.  I rinsed and drained the beans, mashed with a spoon in the skillet, then added drained corn.  Instead of the tomatoes, I added a can of Rotel (tomatoes and green chiles) with juice.  Added cumin, cayenne for heat, salt and pepper.  Turned out great for Mothers' Day.  Everyone couldn't get their hands out of it!

We scarfed it down as was though there are a few changes I would make next time - don't bother with the sundried tomatoes, I could hardly taste them.  Mash the beans up a bit before broiling so it is more a dipping texture and maybe add some salsa - yum!

This was a very good recipe.  Even my two self-proclaimed tomato-hating picky eaters wolfed it down and begged me to make more.  It was very easy and fast.  I did omit the corn.    The only reason I gave it 5 stars instead of 4 was because I think it would be better with some paprika and chili powder.  Still, it was delicious.  I suggest doubling the recipe if feeding more than two people.

This had a great blend of flavors.  I did double the garlic...other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it turned out fabulous!  Thanks for this recipe!  I will use it many times!

This is a greater starter recipe with many options.  i made this last night for my daughter to take to a party.  First I doubled the recipe, then I added some leftover bolonase sauce instead of the sundried tomatoes and some mango/peach salsa.  Turned out great - I know this because 1/2 was gone before she took it, so glad I doubled the recipe.
