So yummy! I used a blender instead of a food processor and it worked just fine!

I almost fell right into the trap of giving this recipe fewer than five stars, and self-promoting by mentioning how I would change it to suit my tastes.  This is a solid recipe, with great ingredients, using sound cooking practices, and while my tastes differ somewhat, the original contributor should enjoy kudos for introducing me to something I hadn't otherwise experienced before.  Thank you Casual Cook!

Great alternative to traditional pesto and makes good use of the abundance of cherry tomatoes in our garden. In addition to serving with pasta, we serve it as a spread with  triscuit crackers or on rustic bread
