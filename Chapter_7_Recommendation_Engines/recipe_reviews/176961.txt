This is how I fixed them.  The only thing is I roll them out and put tooth picks in them then freeze for an hour or so until very hard.  Then I just peel them off the paper and dip in the chocolate one at a time. After they cool I take out the tooth picks.  If they get soft just pop back in the freezer.

Trust me.  This is the bourbon ball recipe.  Make sure to buy quality Kentucky bourbon.  Half the fun is sipping away while making them!  I know many other recipes like to use corn syrups and such, but I've only tried them this way (I've made them many times before) and I like the straight simple ingredients best.  Cheers!

I solve the melting problem by forming the balls, placing them on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper, and chilling them in the freezer for a few minutes before I dip them in the chocolate.  There's really no way around it, though, you will have to work quickly in the chocolate and it takes a little practice before it gets easy.

I've used this same recipe for over twenty years, and it's by far the best and most reliable.   The  only things I'd add is to melt a half-stick of paraffin with the chocolate so that the chocolate doesn't scorch as easily and to make the finished product shinier. I also use toothpicks to dip each ball into the chocolate mixture so that the process goes more quickly. When the chocolate dries slightly, I twist and pull the toothpick upward to remove it, then dip a spoon into the chocolate and dab each ball with the spoon. I've seen some people cover the toothpick hole with a pecan (as the photo in the main recipe shows), but sometimes the extra nut detracts from the overall creaminess of the bourbon ball and the chopped walnuts inside each ball provide plenty of a nutty taste.   I've packaged these treats in Christmas tins as holiday gifts, and they are ALWAYS a huge hit!

This is very similar the bourbon ball my grannie made for Christmas while I was growing up in Kentucky.  A good bottle of fine Kentucky bourbon is a must to make great bourbon balls. I made a batch with this recipe and everyone loved them.  Great recipe!

These are FABULOUS and easy to do.  After reading the reviews, I followed the recipe but doubled it, and used unsalted butter and a stand mixer.  Here’s what I did:

Beat butter on high until creamy.  Stop mixer, add powered sugar and “stir” to combine. Increase speed to high and beat until it is fine, dry and crumbly (like pie dough before the water).  Add the bourbon-infused pecans and stir until mixed (will look like stiff cookie dough).  My pecans soaked for 5 days, absorbed most of the bourbon and doubled in size.  Chill in fridge for a short while.

Form into small balls (1/2” to 5/8” wide made about 65 balls).  My palms became sticky but I scraped them clean with a spoon. The balls will also be sticky, so put them in the freezer to harden.  After 15-30 min you can quickly roll them again and they will become smooth and round.  Keep in freezer until you’re ready to dip them.

Melt chocolate (I used unsweetened with short bursts in the microwave, stirring often).  Insert toothpick 1/4” into frozen ball and dip part way into the melted chocolate while spooning some over the top.  Using the spoon for support, lift the ball and place on waxed paper.  Remove toothpick after a few minutes and put in refrigerator.

I covered the toothpick hole with a dab of chocolate but next time I’d like to pipe on a holly leaf and red berries. I also used melted white chocolate chips but had to add Paramount Crystals to thin the chocolate.  

Thank you, I'll make these again !!

These are marvelous!
I suspect that the folks who've had trouble making the filling have not worked with fondant before thus the directions may be a little too simplistic. I would add "with a mixer, blend the butter and powder sugar. This will produce a lumpy powdery mixture. Then, work this mixture together with your hands, kneading it to a stiff dough-like consistency." It is also important to note that 2 cups of powdered sugar do not equal 16 oz. You must go by weight, which isn't too difficult if you purchase a 2 pound bag of powdered sugar and eyeball it. 
We made a triple batch of these and the sugar quantity when tripled was still dead on correct. Soaked our coarsely ground nuts for a few days in a mason jar using Maker's Mark, then drained them quickly when adding to the filling. Good bourbon is definitely important! I do not normally enjoy bourbon balls, or bourbon in general for that matter, but these are great! We made them for my father's 70th birthday and he is very pleased!

I have made these for years only I have always used unsweet chocolate.  The contrast between the sweet and unsweet is great.  And we store and eat them from the freezer.  I use 1 stick butter per 1 lb of sugar with a tad of burbon poured in. stir till it looks like play dough then we take a pecan that is soaked in burbon and form a ball of dough around that, freeze anywhere from an hour or a few days (depends on when I have time to dip them) then we dip them.  I make anywhere from 500 to 2000 for christmas.  My husband owns a business and he gave them away as a gift one year and people always ask when were gonna make them.  We use a fork to dip let the chocolate run off the tines of the flat fork.

Used pecans (none on top) and followed recipe, adding only a tad more bourbon when mixing the butter and everything together.  MUST be served at room temp to appreciate flavors and texture.  Never had them before---love 'em!  Very easy to make.  I ended up w/ about 36 and did not feel like they were small.

I used Maker's Mark bourbon and then dipped the balls in Wilton Red melted candy.  I wanted to make them look like they had red wax like the Maker's bottles.  Although the Wilton Red is vanilla flavored, they turned out great and added a great suprise in my gift baskets.  This is THE recipe to use when making bourbon balls.  I also dipped some in chocolate and then dipped the top in the red candy to reflect the red wax on the Maker's bottles.

This recipe is great, however I don't thing the poster makes it clear enough that you need to drain the nuts before adding them to the mix.  If I hadn't made candy before I would have had an awful mess.

Delicious!  Turned out perfect the first try and here are a few hints.  First, when mixing sugar and butter, pay attention to consistency, you want it to stiffen up easily.  If too thin or you add extra bourbon, balance it out with more sugar.  Refrigerate the mixture for about 30 minutes, this will help with rolling the balls.  Place rolled balls on baking sheet and freeze for 30 min.  That's all you need, trust me I did it.  I used melting chocolate, which I always prefer when dipping anything to coat in chocolate.  To hide the toothpick hole I sprinkled pecan crumbs, very cute and didn't take away from the flavor of the bourbon.  Oh, and I used Makers Mark... It is perfect for this recipe!

This is the true bourbon ball recipe. For best results use a single barrel bourbon and soak the nuts for at least one week. Also, if the sugar mixture is dry and crumbly, do not hesitate to add a touch of the bourbon that the nuts soaked in. I drain the nuts, and reserve the bourbon and start the nut soaking process all over again.  They store wonderfully in the refrigerator, for several weeks ( I have stored as much as 6 weeks in advance of the holidays ). Enjoy---

I love bourbon and almost everything with it, but I must admitt to being disappointed with these.  I used good quality bourbon and chocolate, but I thought they were too sweet and too dry.  Might try again with some tweeks.

Taste was phenomenal, filling was a little hard to work with.  I doubled the recipe.  For those having a hard time with the butter and sugar, it's just like making a buttercream frosting--make sure your butter is nice and softened, then stir it a bit until it's smooth, then stir in the confectioner's sugar a cup at a time or so.  I did it by hand, but a mixer would make it much easier.  It was REALLY stiff until I added the bourbon-soaked nuts, at which point it became really soft--to the point that I stirred in a bunch more confectioner's sugar to try to stiffen it up.  Didn't work, so I threw the bowl in the freezer for an hour.  After that, I was able to shape the filling into balls (working quickly, with well-greased hands, and sticking them back in the freezer the moment I had a tray completed!).  Froze for ~15 min, then would take out a tray, dip a few in chocolate, then put the tray back in the freezer for another 15 min when they got too soft.  Added a couple Tbls of canola oil to the chocolate to thin it out, but the chocolate coating still ended up being REALLY thick--it kind of overpowered the bourbon flavor.  Definitely make the filling balls smaller than you think you need to, though--mine turned out massive after adding the chocolate coating!

Finally!  A bourbon ball recipe that tastes like real Kentucky candy.  I have seen so many that have CRUMBS of some sort in them, that I knew this was the correct recipe the minute I read it.  One other comment...I could not get the sugar and butter to blend smoothly until I added one more stick of butter.  Then it blended beautifully.  I was using a cheap little hand mixer, this is probably the reason, but I wondered if anyone else had the same problem?

This recipe is PERFECT. I normally end up using too much confectioners' sugar when I make bourbon balls, but this called for the perfect amount. It is alot easier to make the balls if you dip your hands in confectioners' sugar every few minutes. I put the balls in the freezer for an hour before dipping so I wouldn't have to refrigerate overnight. To thin the chocolate and make it easier for dipping, I added about 1/3 a cup of vegetable oil for one bag of semisweet chocolate chips. Excellent!

I made these for my Kentucky Derby party last week.  To say they were declicious is a gross understatement.  Guests couldn't stop eating them.  I made them too big, but I did get 30.  I was nervous about the dipping, but it worked out fine.  I had to stop midway and reheat the chocolate (I did this in the microwave) and cool down the balls, but they came out beautifully.  I didn't add the extra pecan on top, but they still looked great.  A real crowd pleaser!!

Flavor is great but I must be doing something wrong because my mixture is so soft that even after sitting in the fridge overnight, I can't get them to form balls.  And then the minute I do and dip them in the chocolate they fall apart.

I am a cook, turned holiday baker.  An important note for anyone not familiar with making this type of candy (so stating the obvious for you expert candy makers ;) ) the the bourbon creme is easiest blended with your hands.  Once you have mixed the nuts in with the very powdery butter/confectioner sugar mixture just start blending with your hands.  It forms a nougatvery easily when you do this.  This recipe is virtually fool proof and so amazing.  Reminds me of my old Kentucky home!

These were great.  Only thing I did differently was I probably tripled the bourbon b/c I'm from KY and this is how I prefer them.  They tasted great, and I brought them to my boyfriends family in Vermont/Northern NY and they loved them as well.  I recommend freezing them prior to dipping in chocolate to avoid too much melting.  Will be making again next holiday season.

I make these all the time. Use chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup (Evan Williams) bourbon and soak in a (very clean, old spaghetti jar) for at least 3 days-I do a week, but I love the bourbon flavor. Throw out jar and drain nuts from excess moisture on paper towels. Use 2 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar (more or less) just until you get a soft dough.You want whopper candy-sized balls or smaller -just enough so you can pop in your mouth-you don't want to bite it. Freeze at least 30 mins. Work in batches! 2 cups of dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2 tbsp shortening melted for coating. Use toothpick to pierce center, dip quickly and at a slight angle and place. Have a slotted spoon ready-you will drop a few. Cover hole after a batch with more chocolate using toothpick and make fancy point on top. Don't stick a whole nut on top. After they are firm, keep in a plastic container w/lid in fridge for snacking up to a month. **It is excellent with dark chocolate!

The first time I made these I made them exactly as the recipe calls for.  The second time I used pecans and milk chocolate.  I think the milk chocolate smoothed out the flavor and made them just right!  I live in Kentucky so I believe in using a GOOD Kentucky bourbon to make these!!  I actually use Maker's Mark when I make them, in our house there isn't any other bourbon.

These tasted delicious and very alcohollly :-) for the holidays.  The only little problem was that I misread the powdered sugar amount to be by weight instead of volume and ended up with a bucket load of the base butter/sugar mix.  Maybe it's just me but it would've been nice if the recipe had said "1 cup" instead of 8 oz or whatever it was.  Sugar is packaged in weight so both my husband & I made the assumption that the recipe was referring to weight.  Oh well.  I ended up with a quadruple recipe of the base, 1/2 of which I made the Bourban Balls and the other 1/2 I made my own creation of Creme' de Menthe and chopped dark chocolate-a happy creation!

I was really disappointed. I thought they were way too sweet and basically flavorless. I would only recommend making this recipe if you've had Kentucky bourbon balls before and know you like them. I was sorry I had put a lot of time and expense into making these for friends for the holidays .

I have used this recipe for over 40 years and they are always perfect. I use dipping chocolate because using paraffin is not supposed to be consumed (read the warning on the box). I purchase my dipping chocolate at a cake/candy store or you can purchase on-line. Wilton makes dipping "melts" in milk chocolate, white chocolate, semi-sweet and dark chocolate and is available at Wal-Mart.  I chop my pecans very fine, cover with bourbon and do not put a nut on the top.  Good quality bourbon, butter and powdered sugar insure a good product.  My dipping chocolate is melted at half power in the microwave (stirring often because it will scorch) since even one drop of water ruins your chocolate.

I liked the fact there were no vanilla wafers in this recipe.  My daughter in law likes amaretto, so I changed the nuts to almonds, the liquor to amaretto, and used white chocolate to roll them in, instead of regular chocolate.  They were very good.

These ROCK!! I made a batch following original recipe and they came out wonderful. I also made a second batch that I added 3 TBS of cocoa powder to (cuz I am a chocoholic) and since I ran low on pecans I used half walnuts/half pecans, and that worked too:)  The only drawback is that I may have to make more because I don't think these will last until Christmas;)

I've got nothing but compliments and thank you again for this recipe.  I use the toothpicks and freeze the balls an hour before I dip them.  Still very curious how others here get the butter and sugar to mix well so please share your mixing methods if you will.

This is pretty much the same as my old family recipe. We like to use black walnuts. They just seem to go well with the bourbon. I use Makers Mark as well although I have used Wild Turkey, Woodford Reserve and Elijah Craig. Elijah Craig was my five great-grandmother's brother so I guess I have bourbon in my blood.

We didn't have bourbon and my hubby prefers Jack Daniels, so I turned these into Tennessee Whiskey Balls.  I think next time I will Almond Bark for the chocolate coating, it was a bit thick for me.  Great, easy recipe!

I looked at this recipe, the print recipe.  Then I watched the video, no vanilla listed as an ingredient...Oh well too late now.  Also very messy to roll into a ball even after refrigerating overnight.  I am almost afraid to coat them in melted chocolate, might just have to eat them with a spoon!

Excellent recipe. My brother is allergic to nuts so I made a batch with coconut and he said they were fantastic. I soaked the cocnut in bourbon like the nuts and they turned out the same way. one option to consider if you're making them for someone with a nut allergy

My daughter was married this summer in Lexington KY.  Most of the guests were not from KY.  We wanted to give our guests a taste of KY and the bourbon balls were perfect. We put them in small gift boxes and gave them to the wedding guests as favors.  Everyone loved them.  Since it was for a wedding, we made half of them with white chocolate and half with milk chocolate.

This came out well. I followed lots of the tips from the other reviewers. I soaked pecans in Devil's Cut bourbon for 1 week. Despite soaking for so long, the bourbon flavor is not overly strong, which is fine by me. I drained the remaining bourbon off the nuts and then chopped them in a food processor and set aside. I then mixed the butter and sugar in the food processor initially. It was dry so then mixed by hand in a bowl, where it finally came together into a dough-like consistency. Added the nuts and some vanilla (not in the recipe but made a good addition). Formed into balls (my mixture made way, way  more than 24 balls, closer to 48). Put toothpicks in each ball and then put in the freezer for 1 hour. Dipped in melted chocolate to which I added 1 T of shortening to help the chocolate set. Fairly easy to remove the toothpicks after dipping and pretty easy to cover the hole left by the pick. I now have them stored in the fridge. I have made these ahead of time for a party I am having in 1 week. The trick will be not to eat them all before my guests come. Nice recipe. I'm pretty sure they will be a hit.

Shazam, these are way too sweet. This is my first time eating a bourbon ball so I'll assume this is normal and won't rate based on taste. However, I was guided to this recipe by the instructional video and it wasn't until I was up to my knuckles in a mealy butter/sugar mixture that I realized the recipe didn't follow the video. The vanilla was missing, the video appears to use way less sugar, and the ingredients are mixed in a different order. What gives, KY Piano teacher? Did Allrecipes ruin your good recipe? Thanks for submitting it. Now I have a bottle of KY bourbon so maybe I'll make a cocktail.

As an inexperienced candy maker, these were very easy to make.  I made a batch without nuts and added the Bourbon to the batter instead of soaking the nuts.  I increased the amount of Bourbon by a couple of tablespoons for a slightly stronger Bourbon flavor.  The key to successful dipping is to make sure the balls are cold enough (otherwise they start to melt in the chocolate, making it lumpy.)  These are absolutely delicious and easy to make!

First time I've made bourbon balls...they were great. Still need practice with dipping them in chocolate, but reading some of the reviews was helpful.  I'll try freezing them with the toothpicks before dipping!

Great recipe!  I wound up needing more bourbon to soak the chopped nuts, and also added maybe a tablespoon to the mixture after folding in the soaked nuts.  Turned out great!  I also used toothpicks like others suggested.  From a timing perspective - the dipping/coating in chocolate takes me more like 60-90 minutes (in part due to needing to add more chips through the process, waiting for them to melt, etc).  I would plan on more like two hours AFTER you've got the mix balled up and chilled.  We've made these twice now, and they turned out awesome each time!!

UPDATE (have made these 6+ times now)  We also use pecan halves to top with like you see in the picture, and how most are presented in Kentucky.  The trick is that when you pull the ball (using the toothpick) out of the chocolate and place on the wax paper - you can use the pecan half to nudge the ball off the toothpick - and then cover the spot where the toothpick hole was.  Makes it much easier, and they look great!

Another tip - we take a cookie sheet and place a couple of cold packs under neath them.  This helps them cool faster when dropping them on the wax paper!

OMG - are these savory or what?  They're FANTASTIC!   Unfortunately I was so excited about making them, forgot to place the nut on top but they're chocked full of them.  Could barely wait to try one & now can barely wait to share them with family & friends. Not overly strong - they're a perfect concoction. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. Love 'em!

I have never made Bourbon balls before but I have been told by my husband and other Kentucky natives that this recipe was good. I did not like them. Perhaps I misunderstood, but rolling a ball of butter and sugar in melted chocolate makes the ball melt in the process. I ended up just dabbing the chocolate on as best as I could. They turned out a mess as a result. I wouldn't make them again.

These are true Kentucky bourbon balls.  I’ve reviewed them before but I wanted to note that every time I make them, I double the recipe and get over 100 balls each time.  A single recipe is much more than 24 servings as it indicates.  A bourbon ball should be about the width of a quarter...not sure how big the creator of the recipe was making them.

Everybody loved these - for the 2012 season I rolled some in cinnamon sugar, some in powdered sugar and some in cocoa powder.  I didn't do the chocolate yet - try it in 2013.

These are great. I love to bake for the holidays, but find a lot of recipes to be much too sweet. The bourbon in these balances out the sweetness very nicely (I added a little extra). After reading the toils and troubles others had with the melted chocolate, I rolled mine in unsweetened cocoa powder and it worked great. The sharp contrast between the interior and exterior flavors is amazing. Next time I'll soak the nuts for a few days instead of overnight. Best stored in the refrigerator.

Made these for some bourbon-loving clients last year and they were a huge hit so I'm doing it again. I added some fresh-squeezed lemon to mine so there was a little tart with the sweet. These should come with an addiction warning!

This is a great recipe.  I am from Kentucky and have been making Bourbon Balls for 40+ years.  This is one of the best recipes that I have found.
Thank you Ky. Piano Teacher for sharing.

These were great, a little time-consuming and tricky at first but I got the hang of them pretty quick.  Even mom (who doesn't care for rum balls) liked these. Pecans seemed to work best and gave a really nice mellow flavor, walnuts seemed stronger but might have mellowed with a bit more time in storage.

Woah!  This is super rich: one bourbon (butter?) ball and you'll be completely satisfied (so invite your friends!).    DEFINITELY freeze the balls before you try dipping them in chocolate.  I used a toothpick and only dipped half of each.  Letting everything set overnight (twice!) seemed to really help the flavor.

Thank you for a simple yet wonderful receipe. My husband grew up in KY and now I live here. It's all most a sin not to make these for the holidays. So I set out to find one that even I could make and I DID IT!!!!  Even the older folks were impressed...some asked for more Bourbon...lol. Thanks again!!!!

I made them a little extra boozy by soaking the pecans in 6 tbs. of bourbon.  Like others, I found the mixture very sticky/runny to work with and found intermittent  trips to the freezer very helpful.  Even so, I found the mixture often melted under the heat of the chocolate coating, as I was dipping.  (It melted into the bowl of chocolate as I was dipping/coating).  I appreciated the other tips I read, here.

Froze them before dipping in chocolate.  Soaked the nuts for almost a week and they were perfect.

Perfect recipe and easy, use the whole 16 oz box of powdered sugar and don’t drain the nuts! The sugar and butter looked very dry (still like powdered sugar) after mixing. I was going to drain the nuts after reading some of the reviews that said to, BUT DON’T. That tiny bit of extra liquid brought it together perfectly. I used my stand mixer and a cookie scoop for the balls. The scoop eliminated the mess of rolling the balls and they looked perfect!  And they are delicious! The photo is before dipping.

Very good but the recipe did not tell you were to  / when to put I the 5 tbs of bourbon.  So I will try this again and they will turn out better.  Very good flavor.  I did soak some pecans halfs  in bourbon then drained, lightly salted with  sea salt  roasted them at 375 for 5 min per side.  Put them on top of the completed balls.

I love this recipe, but I cut back on the bourbon by one Tablespoon. I also added a tiny bit more butter and creamed it without working it too much. They were creamy melt in your mouth! Not dry at all. Yes, the longer they sit the stronger they are!

Great recipe!!! I was looking for the recipe my late MIL used to make.   I am soaking the nuts for my second batch.  I will buy regular baking semi chocolate for the next batch.. I messed up and bought chocolate chips this time.  I added 2 Tablespoons coconut oil to 2 cups chips.  I was worried because they didn't look like they would set up.  I put them in the refrigerator and left them alone about an hour and they are great!  I did run out of chocolate, though.   I can't wait for hubby to try these!

So easy and everyone loved them. I did not change anything. The difference between these and other bourbon balls is that the bourbon flavors the rest of the ingredients without overwhelming them. (I used good bourbon, which may help.)

I have made Kentucky bourbon balls for years, lost my recipe.  I decided to try this one.  All went well until the chocolate.  I used the double boiler on the stove (not my first attempt for this process.) It was mess in trying to dip roll whatever.  I started over with a microwave method of melting the chocolate much easier and more efficient.  Will not do this recipe again.  I need to find my old family recipe.  The flavor is not favorable.. I was told it taste like home.   What happened?

I’ve made these several times including 600 for my daughter’s wedding favors.  I love this recipe. It is easy and very forgiving.  I soak  the pecans  for a minimum of 5 days and use about 7 tablespoons of Woodford.  After 5, I drain off any excess but usually the pecans have soaked up the majority of the bourbon. I mix the butter, sugar and pecans together and then form the balls. I put a toothpick in the ball prior to freezing them.  I put them in the freezer for at least 2 hours.  For chocolate I use Merken’s disks and melt them in a double boiler.  I work in 7-10 ball increments, keeping the rest in the freezer.  In the meantime, I put melted chocolate with a little vegetable oil in a decorators squeeze bottle.  I keep this in a bowl of hot water until ready to use.  After I dip the batch, I remove the toothpick and starting at the toothpick hole, I put a swirl on each candy, using the squeeze bottle.  I find an extra pecan on the top competes with the bourbon infused pecans in the center so I do not use pecans as a decoration.  These are delicious and a favorite Christmas gift.

I made these with the semi-sweet choc. And although I hated to waste the other good ingredients  I ended up throwing them out! Way too sweet! I made them again using milk choc. morsels with  1 TBSP shortening using a double boiler.  I also freeze  the balls with toothpicks in them  so dipping them is easier. They do need to be kept in the fridg. until  ready to serve, as the choc. gets a little soft. If you're  like me  pop one in your mouth every time you pass the fridge.  Ha!  You can use  regular candy making dipping chocolate  too , which is a firmer choc.

Much better than the recipes with vanilla wafers. Reminds my husband and I of  the bourbon balls we have purchased at the local Kentucky specialty and liquor stores. I added extra bourbon (a 4 count) while mixing the butter and sugar. They were not too dry. We finally found THE bourbon ball recipe. Will definitely be making every year.  Yummy!

These are super easy and DELICIOUS!  I made them as written.  It was simple to remove the toothpick and swirl the chocolate over the hole before adding the pecan half.   I froze a hard plastic container of them and I’m still enjoying them three months later!   They freeze excellently!  The bourbon flavor is just right.  This recipe has been added to my Christmas baking list.  Yum!!

Made multiple batches for an organization event.  They came out lovely and the flavor was spot one.  You can get about 25 one-inch balls per recipe.  I put 5 cups of chopped pecans into a quart jar, adding 5 tablespoons of bourbon after each cup of pecans.  I rotated the jar for 2 days so the nuts absorbed al the liquid.  Making a double batch per heavy duty mixer worked great.   I coated the first 100 with semisweet chocolate &  a pecan then coated the last 50 with unsweetened ghirradelli cocoa.  The stronger bourbon flavor came through with the cocoa, although the chocolate were fabulous.  Considering the work and mess involved with melted chocolate, I'll have not problem coating them all with cocoa in the future.

I made it as written except I doubled the recipe.  Sickening sweet, truffle like texture.  Taste is acceptable but I could only eat  one.  Will continue to try and find a  similar recipe but not quite as  sweet. A small crock pot works wonderfully to melt the chocolate and keep it warm while dipping.

All I can say is wow! I served these at a party and they were a big hit. They are INCREDIBLY rich, so one are two are sure to be enough per person at a time. I followed the recipe exactly and did as some other commenters suggested: I used a toothpick to dip the balls into the chocolate mixture and then placed another soaked pecan on top of the ball to cover the toothpick hole.

This recipe, with just some minor adjustments won me the blue ribbon at the Kentucky State Fair. They are very popular and requested for every party and gathering. I like to keep my pecan pieces a little on the larger side. This helps in getting more concentrated bursts of bourbon flavor and makes them a little less sweet. I also soak my pecans for several days to really let them soak up all the bourbon. If I am using general semi-sweet chips (think Nestle or Hershey's) I typically add a little shortening to thin it out a bit and help get a nice sheen. They are even more delicious if you can use a high quality chocolate that is tempered. A plastic fork with the center two tines removed makes an excellent dipping tool.

These turned out great.  The only thing I would suggest is putting them in the FREEZER a day or two in advance.  I had mine in the fridge initially and they didn't harden very well.  Even after they are in the freezer, I was still able to roll them into a ball.. which was nice because they lost their round shape when they were in the fridge.

If you make the recipe as given into 3/4 inch balls ,then count on having more. I doubled the recipe meticulously sticking with the 3/4 inch size. I ended up with 7.5 dozen balls. I suggest that you make each ball as small as possible (1/2 inch). Also, I recommend soaking the pecans longer than one night; especially if you like bourbon (who wouldn't!).  I did add about 2 T. of bourbon to the BUTTER mix thinking it was too dry. This was a great idea! I then put the butter balls in the freezer since I had an errand to run. DO NOT ADD BOURBON to the chocolate. Rookie mistake! It will set up your chocolate in the double boiler like a rock in two seconds. (Can you tell I like the bourbon taste) I read that many folks say using toothpicks work, but I found that a dinner fork is faster. Keep a rubber spatula in the chocolate using it to scrape off excess chocolate.  My maternal grandparents are from Kentucky so this will be a great Mother's day gift!

At my husband's suggestion that it needed the Nilla wafers, I pureed a whole box of the mini's and added it to the other ingredients.  This seemed to give the dough a bit of the backbone needed when I attempted this recipe with the original ingredients.

Simply one of the easiest candies I've ever made and they taste delicious. Everyone loved them.   I used a Eagle Rare single barrel bottle of bourbon, which gave it a smooth taste and was absolutely worth it.   I omitted the extra nut on top and was glad I did.   It was creamy and smooth with a hint of honey from the bourbon, no harsh after taste.

This recipe did not work for me.  I had no bourbon (don't care for it), so used rum and followed recipe as stated.  I could smell the rum, but no flavor was in the sugar/butter mixture.  I could not even taste the nuts, just sugar/butter.  It must work for many others though!  However, I will try another recipe.

I made these several times and used some of the reviews to change it.   I also freeze the balls before dipping in the chocolate but I make the balls smaller like 1/2 in. and put a pecan slice on top.  This is a sweet recipe so smaller balls goes further .

These are incredible.  I took them to work and they were the hit of the day.  The reason I gave them 4 stars is that I think they are a little too sweet for me: personal opinion.  No one else seemed to mind the sweetness.  Please make these exactly as directed.

I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was so soft you couldn't work with it at all. I added extra powdered sugar and that didn't help. I had to spoon the dough onto the wax paper. This is the worst bourbon ball recipe I have ever used and would not recommend it to anyone.

These are legit! Fantastic for holidays and parties. People's eyes always light up when you walk in the door with these bad boys! Full disclosure, I didn't add the crushed/soaked nuts to my second batch as I prefer a creamy consistency - like Rebecca Ruth bourbon balls. But either way is a total home run. Like another poster said, adding half a stick of paraffin to your chocolate will give the finish a nice shine.  Serve at room temp to release the full "effect" of the bourbon.

Best recipe ever!  My first attempt wasn't great, changed to
Knob Creek and it made a world of difference.  Freezing the balls with a toothpick is key in getting a good result in dipping.  The 60 % Cacao melting chips is also a must.

This is a good recipe if you know a little bit about what you're doing. You really don't need vanilla wafer crumbs & corn syrup. The only thing I'd try to improve on is to add just a tad more bourbon to the recipe.

My mother made these every year but put the bourbon straight into the sugar mixture. The whole family loved them and we continue to make them even though Mom is long gone. Be aware however, there is no cooking so the alcohol DOES NOT get burned off and they are potent little boogers!

Wish I had read through all the reviews to pick up on how much tweaking this needs!! Even have injected extra bourbon and cannot taste it per too sweet and gooey. I am an excellent baker but found no way to salvage these. So, so disappointing.

My friends and I held a 4th July party as we'd all recently returned from separate holidays in USA.  I made these and they loved them.  I initially thought they'd be too sweet given the large amount of sugar, however, the nuts and bourbon seem to counteract this.

My boyfriend really liked these and the bourbon taste really came through, but they were a little too soft for my liking, especially if they are left out of the refrigerator for any period of time. They were also messier to coat than my other truffles (I used the easy decadent truffle recipe to make a variety of other flavored truffles) as dipping these in chocolate, even after I had rolled them into balls with toothpicks and frozen them in the freezer, wanted to come apart in the chocolate.
