I made this for Thanksgiving . I made up our favorite stuffing "sufficiently hydrated" of course. The breast that I used was boneless. about 2 pounds. I prepped as Chef John did. it took 70 minutes t get to temp. I let it rest about 10 minutes. It was moist and tender. And it was very very tasty. Thanks  Chef John

This was easy and perfect portioning. I used a boning knife to carve it.  Worked like a charm.  Even my leftovers were gorgeous...and you can pick the meat off the breastbone when no one is looking.

I was hoping for a little more moist, but it was very tasty and easy to prepare, and looked fancy! I just used a box of stuffing mix and it was enough for a large breast.

I made it using a whole turkey breast. I stuffed one side hasselbeck style and left the other side plain.  It came our very good and we enjoyed it a lot. The stuffing didn't get too mushy and had a lot of flavor from the turkey.  I highly recommend watching the video because that really made cutting and stuffing it easier and there were some good tips in there for keeping the skin  in tact so it would get crispy. I would make this again.

This recipe was OK. The turkey was dry and not that flavorful.  Probably would rub some spices on the turkey breast before adding the stuffing, if I were to make it again.  But I probably will not.

Awesome recipe! It's not the best looking thing to people that are expecting a traditional looking bird. I was sceptical until we say down and starting eating. It was moist (adequately hydrated) and flavorful. I used my own seasoning. One thing make sure you ask for the breast on the bone. I'm sure it will stay together better or try and tie your breast good before you start slicing to add stuffing. All and all this dish was a success.  Oh the sandwiches later were off the hook!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! Will definitely make this again and try stuffing variations. Only change I made was to use a probe thermometer with the alarm set to 160°F since I wasn’t comfortable with taking it out any earlier than that. The turkey breast reached the recommended safe temperature of 165°F as it was resting. It was still very moist and absolutely perfect!

I miss the thighs and drumsticks, but this is an amazing way to prepare turkey breast and stuffing. The turkey is moist and tender from the wet stuffing (I used a ciabatta stuffing from that one food-centric tv channel). It's a little tricky to cram stuffing between the cuts in the breast, but all the overflow basted in the turkey juices and adds to the flavor. I roasted the turkey according to directions for 70 minutes.
