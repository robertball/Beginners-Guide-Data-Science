I made this cheesecake for Christmas dinner and it was the best, most impressive dessert I've ever made. I live at a very high elevation so I had to modify the cooking time (increased baking time to 1 1/2 hours). I also thinned down the glaze with additional hazelnut liquor so it would spread easier. This is my new Christmas tradition!

This was SO impressive and SO delicious!  I made it for a New Year's Eve dinner and everyone thought it was store-bought.  It was very easy to make--even easier if you have a food processor to chop the ingredients for the crust.

This is a very rich and delicious cheesecake.  My only suggestion would be to make all the crust ingredients (except for the melted butter) at once in the food processor (instead of chopping each one separately.  I had lots of fun making (and eating) this cheesecake with my daughter.  It cracked right away, we covered it with chocolate, and no one was the wiser! :)

LOVED this cheesecake!  Not hard to make (first cheesecake I've made where it didn't crack!)  The crust was hard to press into the bowl, possibly because I didn't grind up the hazelnuts and chocolate chips well enough. Overall, very rich and tasty!

Very Good. I increased the filling by 1/3 to make it a little taller. I also use hersheys special dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and used Mocha Kalua instead of hazelnut (its all the store had) but it came out amazing anyways. The hazelnuts in the crust paired with the mocha make it taste like a ferrero rocher chocolate...only cheesecake form. Very good recipe!

WOW!!! Made this for Thanksgiving and it was soooooooooo wonderful!  Everyone loved it...my boys fought over the leftovers the following morning for breakfast!!!  I used chipped semi-sweet large choc. chips in the crust and for the topping...used mini semi-sweet chips for in the filling...used chopped toasted nuts on top...and used raw sugar (simply don't care for white sugar).  A definate keeper - making next weekend for a Christmas party!!!  Thank you!

This was one of the best cheesecakes I have had.  I replaced one cup of cream cheese with a cup of sourcream so it wasnt as heavy and the store didnt have vanilla crumbs so I used graham crumbs.

Absolutely fantastic!  There is definitely some work involved, but it is well worth it!  I used Frangelico in my cake and everyone loved this.

This was my first cheesecake, and it was delicious.  I didn't have the liqueur, which means I also didn't do the glaze.  I wanted to try the basic recipe first as a practice run, and I will definitely make it again--glaze and all, especially around the holidays!

Absolutely divine!  I selected this recipe because I needed to use up hazelnuts and it was the best decision I ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly but threw some chopped hazelnuts into the chocolate topping.  It was absolute perfection!

I ended up with a very tasty cheesecake, but  I wouldn't call it a hazelnut cheesecake as the hazelnut flavor is very faint.  I even added an extra tablespoon of the liquor but I still could barely taste it in the final product.  And the flavor of the hazelnuts in the chocolate topping is mostly overpowered by the taste of the chocolate.    Also, don't be mislead by the prep/cook time listed on here.  It takes more than 5 minutes to prep, more than 10 minutes to cook and then you need about 2hrs minimum for it to cool down before it's ready to serve.  Still, if I hadn't been hoping for a hazelnut-flavored cheesecake, I would've been very happy with this recipe

Delicious!!!! I could used hazelnuts that were in the shell so this was a family project that took all day. But it was delicious.  I substituted 1 tb baileys and 2 tb hazelnut coffee creamer.

Fabulous cheesecake...be sure to grind up the hazelnuts well for the crust.  I also used milk chocolate in the crust and cheesecake batter and used semi-sweet chips for the topping.  Rather than hazelnuts on the top, I used sugared raspberries....this cake was the hit of Christmas dinner!!

This was a great recipe that will serve a large crowd. It is definitely rich so a little goes a long way in serving a group. This was the first time a made a cheesecake and mine fell a little after taking it out of the oven.  I think it may have been because I mixed it on high instead of low. I did have trouble getting the crust to stick on the sides of the pan so had to add more butter. Will make again and correct my mistakes. Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and it was a huge hit! I was very ill the night I made it (Wednesday before Thanksgiving), had a slight fever, this cheesecake came out perfectly! It is delicious, and I did not have Frangelico hazelnut liquor so I used Kahlua. I had toasted the hazelnuts and that flavor combined with the chocolate, made it taste just like Nutella! This is a keeper!

The shell was very good, and so was the topping.  the cheesecake itself was just okay.  Their were way to many chocolate chips and it was dense, not creamy and light.  I followed the directions exactly.  My cheesecake puffed up really high and then fell as it cooled.  I don't think anyone ate this on the Christmas buffet.  I would not make again although might use the shell for a different type of dessert.
