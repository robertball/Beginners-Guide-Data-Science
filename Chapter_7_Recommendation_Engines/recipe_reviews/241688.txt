It sounded like something my kids would even like, but they were not very happy at all. My wife was not too impressed either, but I overall thought it was ok... At least it was something different!

A combination of pepper jack and cheddar is what I used.  Sriracha for the bold, ketchup for the grands and wimpy adults were the condiment toppings of choice.

this recipe had no taste!

Use jalapeno hot dogs and instead of pasta use hash browns with peppers and onions  and use Mexican cheese  it's delish
