Well, it lived up to its description "Quick, warm, cheap and very filling."  There is too much macaroni for the amount of liquid and the clam flavor gets lost. I even replaced the chicken broth with clam juice.  The only flavors that come through are tomato and chili.  I'm sorry, but we will not be having this again.
