This gravy was phenomenal. I used chicken boullion and cut the water to 1-3/4 cups instead of the full two. Instead of dissolving the corn starch in water, I dissolved it in milk. This made the gravy nice and thick and creamy. It was delicious and there was no odd texture or appearance to mine as other reviewers have stated. I definitely recommend using milk instead of water as it really gives it a nice color and appearance.

This recipe was outstanding! I did however, use the suggestion for the milk and I have to say it came out creamy and had a wonderful look to it! This recipe is great for a quick gravy! I will be using it again!!!!

This was just about the worst thing I've ever tasted. It tasted like thick, greasy water. My husband and I were both in shock at how gross this stuff was. I will definitely keep looking for a different chicken gravy recipe.

This chicken gravy recipe is delicious and almost fat free, too! It is quick and easy and worked well with vegetable broth and/or beef broth for other types of meat, too! I will use this recipe again and again.

I was looking for an easy gravy recipe to go with leftover mashed potatoes and stuffing, and came across this one. I did alter the recipe a lot, and it came out quite good. I boiled 2 cups of water, and dissolved 2 chicken boullion cubes in it. I added about 1 teaspoon of Bell's seasoning, and 1 teaspoon of seasoned salt. I mixed 1/2 cup warm water with 2 tablespoons of flour, and whisked it into the broth until well blended. Thanks for the idea!

This was the worst gravy that I have ever had, it didn't even taste like gravy.  It tasted like I was just putting a bunch of herbs on my rice that didn't go together. It almost ruined the whole meal!

This works well when you don't have any pan dripping to work from.  It doesn't have a strange color and thick consistency.  My children and husband both said that it was tasted fine.  The only thing that I did different was adding extra poultry seasoning.

Great easy recipe. I have added it to my "staple" recipes. You can add anything to change the flavor, herbs and seasonings. But just as good the way it is :)

Well, hmmm.  I must mention, I'm as bad at making gravy as I am frying foods (which is pretty bad).  I usually buy gravy from market day, or in desperation ask my mom to come over and make it (she lives 3 minutes from me).  As this gravy tasted good, a little salty (could have been the boullion that I used) but the consistancy, well I'll put it to you this way, my 11 year old son asked me if I blew my nose in it (which could mean nothing after the yukon gold mashed potatoes comment, he's such a jokester).  It was sort of gloppy, but the taste was good.  I'll make it again in a bind, Thanks Barbara.

well now. 4 stars. why? bc my cook-of-a-friend just informed me that the reviewers here hit the spot with the milk issue. milk totally dissolves the corn starch. pour a bit and then add the corn starch. THIS makes for a lump-free situation. there is science behind all of this, but is an excellent tip that you should totally go with. i poured my broth from the slow cooker (i cooked an organic chicken, has some broth, made chicken salad with homemade mayo--using grapeseed oil, another recipe--added the bones and fat back into the slow cooker with more water--and cooked on low AGAIN for about 2 hours)...took the broth...didn't have cheesecloth so used a handkerchief--sieved it--poured it into tiny pot with the milk and cornstarch...added organic concentrated chicken broth....some sea salt instead of poultry seasoning...and it was GOOD. i didn't measure anything, but i would say i used about 1.5-2 cups of chicken broth, 2+ tbspn of corn starch (similar to amt here) and about 1 tspn (maybe less--as recipe has here) of sea salt instead of poultry seasoning..it's really GOOD. this is a bare-bones awesome beginner's gravy. kicking it up a notch might entail the throwing in of various veggies with broth. if my son eats this, i'll be over the moon. if not, i sure as hell will have at it myself...i've already indulged in several SPOONFULLS and have some broth on the standby to make more.

I used 2 cups bouillion dissolved in boiling water.  I then melted 3tblsp butter in a skillet and added 2tblsp flour to make a roux.  Wisked the roux into the bouillion with about a tsp of milk, simmered until thickened.  Perfect!

Wow!  I consider myself a gravy expert but this simple recipe (made from the rotisserie chicken) is beautiful!  I added some water since it was too thick, and some salt for our tastes, but it was YUMMY!

Great recipe!  First off, I have to tell those of you who have not made gravy before - do not mix the cornstarch/water too far ahead of making the gravy.  I did this & when I put it in the chicken stock, it instantly solidified!  I considered letting it go to see if it would eventually mix back in, but decided quickly just to fish it out (it was large chunks) and put in a new mix.  The 2nd time, I mixed the cornstarch with milk (first time with water) & added it to the broth immiately.  So, it could have been that I used milk instead of water or it was just that I originally mixed it too early.  

With that said, loved the recipe.  I used bullion to make the stock.  Using milk with the cornstarch instead of water, it takes on a cream-of-chicken soup look.  Added a blend spices a bit at a time until I liked it.  

Using this to dip my fluffy biscuits in!

This is a legit recipe. I used 1 3/4 cup of milk instead of water, and 2 chicken bouillon cubes instead of chicken stock. Then added a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash table blend. It was thick, creamy, and delicious.

I am only giving this gravy two stars because chicken poultry just do not add enough flavor. I had to add salt,adobo, cumin and some onion powder.
I cooked the chicken and after it was cooked removed it from the pan and use the chicken scraps and added it in. It was delicious!!!
Will be making it again and then I will write down exact measurements.

This recipe is a good place to start, but bland without some necessary changes. I sauteed some onions in butter, then put them in the blender with 1 cup water, 1 cup milk, a chicken boullion cube and the cornstarch. Pureed them all until smooth then put back in the pan to boil and thicken. Tasted really good considering there was no roast drippings!

A very good and simple recipe if your looking for something to accompany your mashed potatoes! I also liked the fact that you don't use flour as that means it has less calories!

Thanks!

When you don't have chicken drippings to work with, this method is a decent option.  I make this gravy all the time to put into my chicken pot pie recipe.  I use a little less of the poultry seasoning but then add a couple pinches of thyme, a pinch of onion power and a grind or two of black pepper.  Have also served this over breaded and baked chicken cutlets, works really well for me.

Pretty good gravy that is ready quick. Be sure to dissolve all the cornstarch in the water before adding to chicken stock to prevent lumps.

I used the pan drippings from a chicken I made and added it to the chicken stock. I used water with the cornstarch and 2 cups of chicken stock and it came out perfect. There was not a weird consistency at all. This was delicious!

I was leary b/c of some of the bad reviews but I'm so glad I tried this gravy, it's very tasty and the consistency is just right (neither too watery nor too pastey).  It was the perfect compliment to a chicken casserole I made and it couldn't have been easier to make.  thanks for the recipe!

So easy and quick to make! I surprised myself! I didn't have chicken stock so I used a can of chicken broth hoping it would come out ok. A pleasant surprise. Next time I'll be sure to have chicken stock on hand.

I am pretty much with Siralee on this one. However I did not use milk and I think I should have. I will use milk & flour next time. I did add a little salt & pepper and did use chicken bullion powder, didn't seem overpowering.

This was not as smooth as I hoped. I am used to working with cornstarch, so I know that I blended it well. I used the broth from boiled chicken and herbs, and even added extra chicken broth granules. The flavor was still only moderate. I also added extra broth to thin the gravy out some. My suggestion would be to add about a half cup more broth and more chicken flavoring.

The gravy's consistency is good, but it needs seasoning. I would cut down on the poultry seasoning and add salt next time. The poultry seasoning gives it a very bitter taste.

OMG!!!  This has to be the worst tasting gravy I have ever had.  The texture, color, and taste were horrible.  I tried to add numerous other seasonings just to make this thing eatable and I just could not do it.

Used pan drippings (including some chopped onion that cooked with the chicken) from a roast chicken and some homemade chicken broth.  Used cornstarch and water but it wasn't thick enough so I added some flour.  It was bland so I threw in a boullion cube and it made the flavor so good.  This is a great add-to recipe.  Thanks!

Made this because my mother doesn't like brown gravy (crazy). This was excellent with the Tender Pan-Fried Chicken, and great on mashed potatoes. Absolutely delicious.

This was very good for the quickness but I made my own poultry seasoning so it was to my taste. It turned out a little jello-y but I think that was my fault. I used chicken bouillon cubes.

This was quick and easy.  I used chicken broth and this was super easy and delish.  But, I suggest cutting back on the amount of poultry seasoning - you can always add more. 1 tsp turned out to be too much for me, so I added a can of turkey gravy I happened to have on hand to tone it down and it was perfect.

A decent gravy that does well in a pinch.  It's more of a weekday dinner gravy rather than a Thanksgiving gravy.

I did have to quadruple the recipe for a church gathering and it didn't work.  Even though I followed the directions, it was very light in color and bland in taste.  Not sure if that was due to increasing the servings.

This was great! I made my stock using boullion, then boiled two chicken breast in it for about 1/2 hr, took the chicken out when juices were clear, mixed milk instead of water like others suggested and added seasoning, shredded the chicken and put it back in when it thickened and then poured it over box mashed potatoes!  I was a very quick GOOD and easy meal to make;)   I thought it could use more pepper but I LOVE pepper so yeah... will use again! Thank you

Amazingly easy and delicious gravy! My husband loved it! I made some sauted chicken breasts on the stovetop with garlic and Pappy's seasoning. When that was done, I used that pan with leftover droppings to make the gray in. I just added the chicken stock and cornstarch, and then salt and pepper to taste.

It doesn't get any easier or any better than this. I did use milk instead of water, just a preference for our family.  Instant gravy!! Thanks for helping when I needed an easy recipe fast!

BEST GRAVY EVER! For those people that said it didn't taste good, it's probably because their chicken wasn't great.

This was ok and it worked in a pinch, but the real thing is better, of course. I used flour instead of corn starch (I have to watch all input of starchy things) and it came out thinner than noted. Used a lot of seasonings and added white pepper.

I used 1 3/4 water and two bullion cubes.  Then disolved the cornstarch in 1/4 cup milk (make sure that it is completely disolved) and added it to the bullion added some pepper and it was the best gravy I ever made!

Like other reviewers I used boullion cubes and boiling water since I didn't have chicken stock, and I mixed the corn starch with milk instead of water. I'm not sure why, but when I added the cornstarch mixture to the water, it instantly clumped up, and no amount of stirring would fix it. I thought it was ruined. But I strained it and served it and it was delicious. My husband mentioned it was a bit runny, but he liked the flavor. I prefer making gravy with the pan drippings, but this was a good substitue since i was using a pre-roasted chicken and didn't have any.

Yeah, I definitely had a lot of trouble with this recipe. It's possible that I did it wrong, but I followed all the directions and I basically got clumpy goop. Gravy is much more difficult to make than I anticipated.

EXCELLENT.  I used a little less cornstarch but I had some fresh chicken stock available and just a little salt -- it came out great.  It's a nice quick, easy and very tasty alternative to traditional gravy.
Thank you, Barbara, for sharing this recipe.

I did not care for this. It was gelatinous and looked like pea soup. My mother-in-law said it looked like lemon meringue pie filling.

I made it per the recipe, used chicken stock and bouillon to make the total quantity.  It was overpowered by one teaspoon of poultry seasoning. A tiny dollop went on the rice and chicken went bare.

In the words of Billy Crystal, "This was mahvelous daughling, simply mahvelous!" I'm not sure why others have had trouble with this. I did modify it a bit. It's a great base to play around with. I boiled 1 cup of water with 1 heaping tbs of Herbox Sodium Free chicken bouillon powder (for those of you who like salt, you could use chicken broth or the regular bouillon granules and probably have enough sodium to taste, but you can always add more; just add more a little at a time), 1/4 tsp black pepper and a bit of sodium free homemade season all. I slowly stirred in 1 cup of cold milk into 3 tbs cornstarch, then whisked it as I poured it into the boiling water because cornstarch settles at the bottom quickly. After it began to boil it thickened up nicely. You can add whatever other flavors you like. It's very good and this is my go to gravy recipe.

I needed a quick, easy gravy to serve with leftover turkey and mashed potatoes and this was perfect. It is not a culinary masterpiece by any means. Just a simple gravy to go over leftovers.

I made this tonight, and we really liked it. I used some home made chicken stock I had frozen. I read other reviews first and thank you suzyq (July 26.2011) for the tip about mixing some milk into the cornstarch for a lump free gravy, it worked great. For such a simple recipe, it was very, very good. Will be making this again. Thank you Barbara

Not a bad quick-to-make gravy.  I do have to agree with others who said the consistency was not the best.  It reminded me of lobster sauce from a Chinese restaurant.  I'd suggest going easy on the corn starch.  I wonder if potato flakes would work better as a thickener than the corn starch?  Overall, it's a decent gravy to use in a pinch.

Loved it. I dissolved the cornstarch in milk instead of water, added a little bit of butter, and some old bay/pepper/salt. Turned out good and the hubby liked it. :)

Perfect!!!  I made a whole chicken in the croc pot today, let it slow cook for about 10 hours, deboned it.  The wife made mash potatoes and I used this gravy recipe.  First, its the first time I've ever made gravy successfully and Second, my wife who's the pickiest eater in the known world loved it as did my  5 year old (he had to have the gravy on everything)  Thank you so much Barbara!!!

Made this recipe tonight because I was out of jarred gravy and it was definitely the BEST chicken gravy both my husband and I have ever tasted!  I added a bit of the dripping leftover from seasoned and baked chicken and I used 3 Tbsp. cornstarch with 2 Tbsp. 2% milk.  Thanks for a great recipe, Barbara and thank you Allrecipes for NEVER letting me down.  I come here often for recipes and each one I find and make is absolutely delicious!

I needed gravy to make stuffed chicken breasts, I like to put gravy inside with the stuffing.  I literally just made this in about 2 min and I made my own poultry seasoning since I didn't have any.  This is the perfect thickness for inside the chicken, nice and thick, not runny.  I did use 1 3/4 cups of boullion and used milk to mix with the cornstarch.  Can't wait to make the chicken tonight :)

I only gave this 3 stars, because I modified it a bit. Instead of using Chicken Stock, because I didnt have any. I used 3 chicken bouillion cubes and 1 3/4 cup of water (as suggested by a previous reviewer). I mixed the corn starch with milk instead of water (as suggested by a previous reviewer). I made sure to add enough milk so that it didnt turn into a paste. The first time I attempted this, it turned into a paste and didnt work to well. I used a little bit of poultry seasoning and salt and pepper to taste. It tasted like a good country creamy chicken gravy.

Had some left-over rotissierre chicken breast and had planned to make a casserole , but Hubby said he would like some chicken and gravy over biscuits.  This gravy worked out so well that he said to give the recipe 5 stars. Served it with peas and cranberry .  Delicious!

I'm sorry, but I wasn't a fan of this at all.  The poultry seasoning gave it a flavor I was not expecting at all.  Very far from the traditional "thanksgiving" taste I was trying to aim for.  Should have just started with some salt and pepper. I had to add lots of salt, pepper and garlic powder trying to mask the poultry seasoning. Thanks anyway.

I made this with a roux rather than the corn starch because I thought the olive oil would add a little more flavor (since the recipe itself looked like it may need some).  I still didn't like it.  I'm generally pretty generous in my reviews but this was bland and blah.  Sorry, not a fan.  I'd rather use the little gravy packets from the grocery store.

ok, similar to my own home made gravy recipe. Mine takes many different herbs, and has a much richer taste. I would add a little bit of minced onion. Also, needs more flour.

Excellent recipe!  This one is going in my permanent file.  My gravy never came out right until I tried this one.  I followed a previous post and lessened the water to 1 3/4 c, used 2 cubes of chicken bullion and milk to mix the cornstarch.  I only added two tablespoons of the cornstarch since other posts mentioned the recipe was lumpy.  The recipe is so easy, it's a definite keeper.

Hmmm. Not bad. I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I used Wondra flour (comes in a canister and it says "for sauces and gravy" on it). The Wondra performed better than the cornstarch. If you can use the Wondra, I highly recommend it. There was still something missing in the flavor though. Maybe adding a few pieces of chicken chopped up would help. I'll try again.

This recipe is wonderful. I had some family members over and they just loved. I used milk to dissolve the cornstarch instead of the water, which gave it a wonderful color. Awesome recipe, thanks, Barbara.

This recipe was good with some modifications. I used the suggestion of mixing milk with the cornstarch and I added all-purpose seasoning, parsley and some pepper only. We had it with baked chicken over egg noodles. It was pretty good and kids liked it pretty well - my 5 yr old said I made a good dinner and he really liked the noodles ;0)

I whipped up my favorite drop biscuits and made the gravy while they were baking. I didn't have any poultry seasoning, so I just added a parsley for color and salt and pepper to taste. (I  used milk with the thickening). I also added a small can of white meat chicken. My 6 year old is my picky one and she never usually likes gravy on her biscuits. She not only gobbled this up, but had three helpings!! Some green beans on the side and I had a meal in 15 minutes. All three kids loved it, so I will be making this again for sure!

I think the quality of the chicken stock  would make this gravy good in its simplest form, and the recipe does call for stock. I started with decent commercial stock—not broth, which I think would be too bland as a base for this gravy. I chose to make the cornstarch slurry with milk as others did. I also sautéed some fresh mushrooms and a little bit of shallot, then built the gravy in that pan. A little salt and pepper and some Mrs Dash seasoning and we were in business.

This did not turn out very good.  And it smelled pretty unappealing.  Granted, I’m a rookie at making gravy, but I don’t plan to use this recipe again.

Great base recipe that can be adjusted for personal taste. I used the suggestion of adding the corn starch to milk. I didn't have any poultry seasoning, so I just added my own blend of spices. I added more bullion than the package called for as well. Don't be afraid to taste it and add a bit of this or that to your own tastes.

I made this with a bouillon cube and mixed the cornstarch with milk. I also added a sprinkle of onion powder, garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  Turned out, AWESOME!

I used 2 cups of chicken bouillon in place of chicken stock. The dissolved cornstarch did a poor job of thickening up the chicken broth; it was still runny and not sticking to the whisk after 10 minutes on low heat. I whisked in another ~1 teaspoon of cornstarch without dissolving in water and that did the trick. This was super salty so I didn't add any poultry seasoning and added ~1 tablespoon water to reduce the salt from the bouillon. Simple recipe, will use again.

Delish. Spooned over chicken and dressing was a big hit. Used milk to dissolve corn starch that was suggested in a review. I always read reviews and find them extremely helpful. Keep these great recipes coming.

I tried this because I'm out of flour and didn't feel like shopping for more. It worked out great, but I made some modifications to it. I started with some chopped onion and butter in a sauce pan over medium heat until onions were soft and translucent. I added a bunch of cilantro and the juice of two limes, as well as the rinds of the limes thrown in with a chicken bouillon cube. 

Next I added two thawed and seasoned chicken breasts and just enough chicken stock to almost cover it all. I let that simmer until the chicken was cooked through and strained everything out at the end, saving all of the liquids aside. 

I prepared some Uncle Bens's 10-Minute Brown Rice, and I reserved 1/4 cup of the starchy cooking liquid from the pot and that's what I added the cornstarch to. I only used 2 spoons of corn starch, not 3. 

Finally, I added the starchy water to the chicken broth liquid back into the saucepan and continued stirring over medium-low heat for about ten minutes until it reached my desired viscosity. Pour that over your chicken and rice. DELICIOUS

I'm so glad I came across this recipe. I've made it several times now and thankfully have followed a reviewer's advice in using milk instead of water. I beat the milk and cornstarch and pour it in the chicken stock and add one chicken cube as poultry seasoning. Love love love this quick and easy chicken gravy.

Delicious!!!!! I substituted milk for the chicken stock and then added 1 tablespoon of chicken bouillon once the milk was boiling (make sure to stir milk constantly as its heating up so it doesn't burn). Then I added some garlic powder to taste and added the cornstarch and water mixture. Super quick easy and wonderful tasting!!

Pretty good. I also add a little pepper. A lot depends on the quality of your stock. I make my stock homemade, so it has  excellent flavor.

Agree with previous poater...disolve the cornstarch in cold MILK.  If you dissolve it in water the texture of the gravy will be gelatinous.  Good flavor.  I added a sprinkle of George Washington golden seasoning to bump up the flavor and reduce the single-note poultry seasoning flavor.  Great recipe in a pinch when you don't have meat juices on hand.

I used the dripping from my roated chicken and it tasted great ! It did get lumps after it cooled (towards the end of dinner) so I think I'll try milk next time .

Great recipe. I used half low-fat milk and half water for the stock. I didn't have cornstarch but flour worked just fine. I used lowfat (2%) milk to dissolve the flour in too. It eas awesome.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The gravy turned out thick and creamy. I didn't have poultry season on hand so I just put in 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp garlic poweder, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika and was excellent.

Very good! Followed other modifications and used milk with the corn starch. I used a bold chicken rub, as that was all that I had on hand for poultry seasoning. Spicy! I also added pepper, garlic and onion powder. Looks great and tastes wonderful with stuffing.

Great recipe and wonderful in a pinch when you need the gravy but don't have the cooking juices from the bird!  I also used milk instead of water then added some powdered onion and powdered garlic to add a little more depth of flavor.  Make sure you use really good stock if you want good flavor.  Personally, I like Swanson's Organic chicken broth.

I found this recipe to be extremely bland as written, perhaps in part because I did have to use the chicken bouillon method. It's palatable enough to use in a chicken stuffing casserole, but only after some serious tweaking. I added a good shake of onion powder, s & p, parsley and (as much as I didn't want to add the fat) a little butter. Perhaps I will try again the next time I have chicken stock on hand and it will be better.

Surprisingly good!  I didn't have any poultry seasoning or thyme, just some sage growing in the yard.  I also added some marjoram & dried shallots & simmered to blend the flavors.  We drizzled it over the chicken thighs & brown rice I had made that seemed to be lacking something.  I don't make gravy bec of the fat, calories & cholesterol.  This recipe added moisture & a nice chicken flavor from the broth.  It was great over the rice.  I don't understand the comment that it was greasy.  There is no grease in the ingredients, one reason I liked it.

It made the best gravy I have ever made. A few changes though. Use 3 tbsp and 1 tsp to make the gravy a little thicker and I used one cup milk and one cup water. I added a pinch of salt and some pepper as well. Amazing!

I love this recipe!  Certainly you can add additional seasonings to your liking.  I'll admit that I added a little more poultry seasoning than called for.  I certainly won't be buying cans or seasoning packets of chicken gravy when I quickly make this recipe from scratch!  Thank you for posting it :)

This recipe was just what I was looking for. I needed a gravy for my lunch and didn't have any on hand, so I found this recipe and used it as a base. I substituted half the cornstarch for flour for a better thickness, I also added chicken bouillon powder for some more flavor. Then I just salted and peppered to taste. It was the perfect complement to my lunch! Thanks.

I did not care for this recipe.  Though I will admit to using chicken bouillon instead of chicken stock.

WOW! This is really decent considering that it's practically mock gravy!!!  I thought there was no way that this would taste good, but I used milk to dissolve the cornstarch and it was nice and creamy yet flavorful in taste. I added some extra onion powder for taste and a dash of salt.  A pretty good super low-fat option and it moistens up anything you're serving with.

I used 2 cubes of chicken boullion in 2c. water instead of chicken stock.  I used a mixture of cornstarch, flour and milk to thicken because just the cornstarch wasn't working.  I added more poultry seasoning, pepper, garlic salt and onion powder.  The gravy turned out great.  I used turkey breast fillets and baked them in the gravy.  This really flavored the gravy nicely!!

Ingredients matter! If you use good, quality stock then this will be awesome.  If you use cheap stock it won't be any good.  I tripled it and used it for chicken biscuits and gravy. I didn't have stock, but used 1T of chicken base and 1T of vegetable base for 6 cups of liquid. (use 1t of each for the original recipe).  I also added a bit of garlic powder and dissolved the corn starch in 1C of milk.  I used 5 cups water only, which combined with the milk made 6 cups liquid.

I made this with 4 bouillon cubes with 2 cups water. Added cornstarch mix till thick, then added 1/2tps. ground sage, dash of salt & pepper. I didn't have poutlry seasoning available. I used this with grilled chicken and noodles. It had great flavor and my family asked to keep it in our menu.

This worked very well for my chicken commercials I made for supper. Was a little scared so I bought dry packet gravy just incase...but this recipe fit the bill. The only thing I did different was to add a few chicken boullion cubes & salt & pepper, I dbl. the recipe & just cut back on the poultry seasoning by about 1/2 tsp. Family said I can definately remake the meal...so the gravy must have worked for them too!

I needed a chicken gravy recipe in a pinch, and found this one first. Didn't read any of the other reviews, just made it according to the directions and it was great, great, great! Perfect for what I needed it for, but if I make it again, since reading other reviews, I think I will mix my cornstarch with some milk and cut my chicken stock back accordingly. Still, it was so simple and tasted great! Thanks.

We needed a quick gravy and thought we would try this.  After reading many of the reviews, I did not quite get the color issue until I made it.  I even used milk instead of water with the cornstarch.  To fix the problem, I added one boullian cube, as well as a bay leaf, into the thickening gravy.  It gave it the golden color that was needed.  It also added a little extra seasoning that was needed.  I then added less poultry seasoning.  In the past, we would have just skipped the gravy.  Now, I know we have a quick tasty and customizable option for our family.  Thanks!

This Gravy turned out really good and only took like 7 minutes to make. I did use flour instead of cornstarch, and added atleast 2 tblspoons of Bells seasoning. Also a little tip: if you sift the flour into the water, its a a little less lumpy. I served this gravy over some leftover turkey (which had become quite dry), on french bread with some cranberry mayo. My housemates loved it!

I basically replaced the chicken stock with the drippings from the pan that I had roasted my chicken in. I poured all the juices in a saucepan, added maybe a little less than equal the amount of water. I then brought this to a boil and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch (already dissolved in water) to the boiling chicken juices. kept boiling and stirring until it thickened and all done!

I made a few changes....
I reduced the poultry seasoning to 1/2 teaspoonful and added 1/2 tsp salt (as I used reduced salt broth) and 1/2 tsp browning sauce. My son turned his nose up at the smell but ended up going back for seconds and poured it over his baked haddock.

Good base for an easy chicken gravy--needs improvement, however. Most importantly, CUT DOWN the poultry seasoning. It was WAY too strong. I also used milk (following suggestions from other reviewers) instead of water. I think I'll try less cornstarch and maybe bouillion+water in place of the broth next time--probably more flavorful. The consistency was okay, but the flavor was a bit off. Worth experimenting with due to the ease and availablity of ingredients already found in the cupboard.

My first time making my own gravy and it turned out great.  I  made it again and it turned out even better with leftover pieces of "spicy rapid roast chicken" (from this web sight) mixed in and poured over a thick toast. All the spices together between the two were so delicious and easy to make.  Oh, and I didn't have two C. of stock so I simply added some chicken broth to the stock.  I also used milk instead of water.

I couldn't salvage this.  My suggestions are: do use milk instead of water to dissolve the cornstarch. Do not add more than the smallest amount of poultry seasoning before you TASTE it. Be clear what seasonings are already in your bullion or stock before you add any salt or pepper, spice, etc. For gravy makers, as usual, just add the cold milk/cornstarch in phases until you like the consistency.   The consistency is fine. The flavor is not to my standards.  If you like the traditional taste of gravy, I do not recommend this one. Yes, this is much easier than pan gravy, but I did not care for it at all.

I admit I also altered the recipe by using milk instead of water to make the rue. But still, this recipe might work in a pinch for some people, but i would never serve it to guests. It was fine for my kids and hubby, and they said it wasn't bad or anything, but it was very... gel like. not to my liking at all. next time i will do everything the same, only i will add flour to the milk instead and try that. this is a very basic recipe, good for people new to making gravy to get practice also. worth trying, some people like certain types of gravy and others dont. oh, also, i added pepper to taste also.

I liked this recipe. The flavour was good. As for the people who didn't like this recipe, I think there are two things that need to be right for it to work out well.
1) I used a good quality packaged chicken broth, no homemade broth or pan drippings that might be too fatty, etc.
2) Mix the cornstarch with about 1/6 cup of cool water, making sure it's mixed VERY thoroughly to avoid lumps.
This was great over mashed potatoes. :)

This gravy has excellent flavor and is very easy to make, even for beginners. I will be using it from now on instead of store-bought gravy.The only changes that I made was that I added chicken bouillon cubes to it for added flavor.I only had homemade chicken broth (made from chicken breasts) and to me it lacks the flavor that canned chicken broth has so that is why I added the cubes. Other than than it is perfect.

The first time I made this it turned out fabulous. The second time was still pretty good, but too thick. I think that I may have let it sit too long. But this is definately a very good and easy recipe.

I read the recipe wrong and used Chicken broth instead of Chicken stock so it was kind of strange looking at first, but I added a bit of the chicken drippings from the fried chicken we had made and it turned out delicious!!  Thanks!

This was great for being in a bind.  The consistency was a little off...I used less cornstarch the second time and it came out a little better.  I also put the spices in before the cornstarch the second time around.  What a flavor boost!
