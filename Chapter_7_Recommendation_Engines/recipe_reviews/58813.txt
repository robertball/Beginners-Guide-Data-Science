These truffles are very rich and wonderful! I followed the recipe with no alterations (did let mixture sit overnight)and rolled in the cocoa powder as suggested. They do get better as they age and I stored them in the freezer. These are what I consider a first class candy great for company and gifts.

AMAZING!!  I decided to make these last year for Christmas and everyone went nuts and started fighting over them.  All year long I have received request after request to make these again, so I did, and the same thing happened.  I even received one of the tins back with a note on it "Fill, and return, please!!"  Last year I followed the recipe exactly, this year I added a hint more of each of the raspberry products and I also coated them with a hard chocolate coating, such as you would with chocolate covered strawberries.  It made ALL the difference.  They were 10-times better this year.  I am now making these every year as gifts!  I also found that the recipe only makes about 50 instead of 72, as it says.

I haven't tried this recipe yet because I can't find Hershey's raspberry chips.  I even asked at one store I shop regularly and got no response.  I'm dying to try this one. if anyone can tell me where to get the chips.  I live in Elk Grove, California on the outskirts of Sacramento.  

I do know that Chambord is the name of one raspberry liquor.

I made these with some friends for Christmas and we each took some to our families.  They are incredibly rich!  These were a big hit with some people. . . others really didn't care for them.  My sister's boyfriend ate most of my share.  Of the people that liked them, they preferred the ones rolled in coconut(we also used Schokinag cocoa powder and powdered sugar).

These are AMAZING!  I chose several truffle recipes from this site to use this year for Christmas gifts.  These were by far the easiest and best-tasting of them.  We'll be using this recipe again next year!

Very good.  The higher the quality of  ingredients you choose, the better your outcome will be.  The raspberry chips were hard for me to find though--I had to order them online.

QUESTION--I looked for raspberry liqueur near the wine section of my grocery store, but did not find raspberry.  What are some of the different brands that make raspberry liqueur??
