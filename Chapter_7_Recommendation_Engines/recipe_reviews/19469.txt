Great combination of tart and sweet!  Didn't seem to fill a 9 x 13 pan, though.  Either use a 9x9 pan, or double the recipe.   Any kind or combination of frozen berries works well.  I decreased sugars and butter, and thought it was still sweet enough.

Rhubarb and raspberry lovers you are going to love this.  Sweet.  Tart.  Vibrant ruby red.  Buttery, crunchy topping.  I halved the recipe, but doubled the raspberries so that I could use the entire package, and Hubs and I agree the 2:1 ratio of rhubarb to raspberries is a good one, at least for our tastes.  I had to play around with this a little to find the right-sized dish.  It's really too thin in the size the recipe calls for and looks rather skimpy.  But if you use a smaller dish the topping then becomes too thick!  I guess I'd say to use what suits you best.   What I ended up with was a rather shallow dessert that definitely was more attractive in individual serving dishes than it was in the baking dish, but ohhhhh was it good.  Hubs might disagree with me on this point as he prefers his cold (yuk!) and plain, but I definitely think because of its tartness it's best warm with either whipped cream or ice cream to mellow it out.

This had great flavor, but turned out a bit runny.  I suggest using a 9x9 pan, increasing the amount of 'crisp' and maybe thickening with a little more tapioca or corn starch.  Will make again.

Holy sugar cubes!  I love sweet stuff, but this is bordering on too sweet.  I used a 9X9 pan and will make it again, but will most likey cut the sugar in half!

I made this today for a friend's bday picnic and it was a HIT!  Gobbled up with no leftovers.  I cut the sugar in half b/c I added very ripe, fragrant strawberries and blueberries instead of raspberries.  I still found it VERY sweet.  I probably could've added a third or quarter of the white sugar.  I didn't have instant tapioca so I added 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, which turned out to be the perfect consistency.  I modified the topping, doubling everything except the butter, which was a mistake.  You need the butter in the topping to really make it crisp.  Mine turned out kinda of soggy where there wasn't a pea-sized chunk of butter, b/c I guess the dry ingredients without sufficient butter would just "dissolve" into the wet filling.  Tasted delicious, but didn't have the contrasting crunch texture from the sweet filling.  I also added cinnamon to the topping, but I didn't really taste it.

24 servings?  Not in my house.  I left my husband alone with it and most of it was gone by the next day.  One serving is never enough.  Really delectable, a wonderful combination of tart and sweet and smooth and crunchy.

As my three year old says "balicious"!   Very good way to use rhubarb.  I used frozen fruits and just cooked it a little longer, and I did not use tapioca, still balicious.

Absolutely delicious!  Took it to work today and everyone loved it, some are taking home leftovers and others have asked for the recipe.  Quickly became my favorite rhubarb recipe!

Reading through the comments led me to increase the rhubarb/raspberry amount to 1-1/2 times what the recipe called for so it would fit nicely in a 9 x 13 baking dish.  I kept the sugar to 1 cup, but put a little extra flour and tapioca because of the increase in berries.  Our family loves topping, so the topping was doubled, plus we added 1 cup extra oats and 1 cup walnuts.  This was cooked in a 9 x 13 baking dish.  We all agreed this is superb and the recipe will be put in “THE COOKBOOK” – our family favorites.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very, very yummy.  I made this once as per recipe, then the next time I used apples with the rhubard and it was equally as good!  This will be a staple in our house!

I definately would put this in a 8x8 pan, or double the recipe as it it not enough for a 9x13 pan.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar.  The taste was very good.

The recipe as it is nicely fits into a 8x8 pan. I could hardly say that it would feed  24 servings, I would be happy if I got 9 servings. It didn't thicken up enough and half of the liquid was butter! 1/2 cup is way too much butter. Every serving would have a tablespoon of butter. It tasted OK. Was a little sorry I cut back on the sugar. Goes well with ice cream.  Think this recipe needs to be reworked. - less butter, more tapioca, adjust the servings.

Excellent!  Perfect right out of the oven over icecream.  I could not find "instant tapioca" at Kroger so I used instant cheese cake pudding instead.    I've made this twice in 7 days and now have to let my rhubarb plant recover.    I also used organic oat flour instead of all purpose flour with no issues.

Very good -- would make again. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 pan. Not too runny, sweet, but not overly so. Other than halving, I followed the recipe exactly.

Very good! I loved the tartness of the rhubarb and raspberries. Not quite enough topping though, I had to add a lot more oats to stretch it enough to cover the whole pan.

Excellent recipe! Went over well with our company. I used a frozen berry mix in place of the raspberries. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 Star rating was it wasn't accurate in the pan size, I tripled the recipe for a 9x13 pan.

My dad's favorite pie is rhubarb so I made this for Father's day.  Since there were only going to be 5 of us for dinner, I halved the recipe, since it said it served 24.  After serving up 4 small to medium bowls I was left with about 2 Tbsp.  There is no way this recipes serves 24.  But had it, there still wouldn't have been any left because it was delicious!

Yummy but I did make a few changes.  I used very ripe strawberries instead of raspberries, decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and it was still pretty sweet.  I also decreased the butter in the topping to 1/4 cup and used whole wheat flour.  I only used 1 Tbsp corn starch as I didn't have any tapioca (probably should have used 2 tbsp as it was a little runny).  Overall it tasted great and I would definitely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy!!! I used 4c frozen Raspberries & 4c fresh Rhubarb and it was delicious. I skipped the tapioca and used about 3 heaping tbsp of cornstarch. A smidge more topping would've been nice given I added a lot of extra fruit... but perfectly tart-sweet! I served it warm & drizzled with unsweetened heavy cream, looking forward to making this again!!!

Awesome. First time cooking with rhubarb and this was a fail-proof recipe. I did substitute chia seeds for the tapioca and whole wheat flour for the AP flour. Also doubled the topping. Baked in a 9x9 but as per other reviewers, I still would double the fruit. Also cut down the white sugar as well... so sweet! Added lemon juice from half of a lemon to cut the sweetness.

I had a ton of raspberries and rhubarb to use from my garden and thought I'd give it whirl. The end result was good, not perfect but I would make it again with a couple of tweaks. Next time I would cut the sugar in half, it really is very sweet and completely over powers that tart. I would also double the oatmeal crunchy topping as I found it to thin. I also made it in a 9x9 pan as I thought a 9x13 would turn out way to thin!

Amazing.  I too reduced the white sugar by 1/3 cup and it turned out great.  I also used blackberries and it wad fabulous.  This will be a staple summer dessert.

This recipe is easy to throw together and you can play with the amounts of rhubarb and raspberries. I used 1/2c. sugar instead of a whole cup.

This is a delicious recipe with a good balance of sweet and tart.  I used half sugar and half Splenda (about 3/4 c total) and used strawberries rather than raspberries.  My husband loved the topping, which I pulsed in the food processor. I had no problem filling a 9x13 dish, but I doubt it would serve 24, unless you only took a couple of tablespoons.

Oh my!!  This is much more than a five star recipe; don't bother with the ice cream or half and half, this one stands on it's own.  Outstanding crisp recipe!!!  Thanks for posting this one!

I'll agree with others that this is easy to prepare and lick the bowl delicious, but if you're a calorie counter I would say a more reasonable portion size for this recipe is 9 – 12 servings.  I also added a pint of fresh strawberries and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the ingredients listed.

Mmmmmm, this was delicious! I substituted strawberries for the raspberries and only used 1/2 c. of white sugar.  Next time I make it I may try reducing the white sugar to a 1/3 c.  Per the reviews, I used 2 T. of tapioca and a 7 x 11 pan.  It was perfect with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream!

Some friends gave us some rhubarb and this recipe was our first time tasting it! Wow is this yummy. I, too, used 2 tablespoons of tapioca and it was perfect. I also added a bit of cinnamon to the topping because we love cinnamon. I baked it in an 8 by 8 pan. I wrote this recipe down in my favorite recipes book and plan to use the rhubarb in the freezer to make it again!

Pretty good, a little too sweet and the crust didn't get crisp enough.  I think it had too much butter, I used half a cup like the recipe said but it didn't ever look like pea-sized crumbles.  More like buttery goo.  It also took longer to cook.  Still pretty tasty though.

This is one of the best rhubarb recipes I have ever tried.  The second time I made this I used 1 1/2 cups of granola in place of the oatmeal.  It was even better and there was just the right amount of topping.

I went to the store to get raspberries just for this recipe and forgot to put them in! Still, it was wonderful. Am making it again tonight for the second time in 3 days. My whole family loves a really crispy topping and this recipe has just that. I too used a 9 X 9 inch pan. I'll be using this topping with other fruits as well. Thank you so much for sharing this terrific recipe!

We all loved this recipe! My mother-in-law thought it was the best rhubarb reciped she's tasted. My husband decided to eat if for breakfast the next day! Instead of a 9 x 13 pan I will make it in a 9in square pan next time to make it a little thicker!

Flavor is awesome.  I used Splenda for baking in place of the sugar.  Made the mistake of mixing the butter mixture by hand...warm large ball that wasn't pretty.  But in the places I glopped it on top, it was fantastic to the tastebuds.  Next time I'll do it right and I'm sure it will be a lot more pleasing to the eye.

Modified the recipe for my lifestyle as follows:  1/4 c sugar, 3/8 c splenda, 3 T corn starch and 6 oz (1 1/2 c raspberries) for the rhubarb/raspberry filling.  Used 1/4 c each brown sugar, whole wheat flour, oats and butter.  Baked in a 9x9 square pan.  I would make it again with these changes.

This was great! I relied on several of the other reviews and made some modifications. I didn't have tapioca, so I added a tablespoon of flour with the cornstarch etc. and it worked out fine. I also reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 c. All my fruit (4 c. rhubarb, bag blueberries, about 1 cup raspberries) was frozen, so I drained off nearly all of the liquid from them so that the crisp wasn't too runny. When measured out, it was probably about 6 cups of fruit and I put it in an 8 x 8 pan. I used all of the crumble, but I reduced the butter to 6 T instead of the full stick. The proportions seemed just right and the crisp was tart/sweet. Served with vanilla ice cream.

5 stars for taste, 3 stars for everything else. Like everyone is saying, it doesn't fill up a 9 x 13 pan which is what I used. The dessert was very thin on the bottom of it. I didn't have quite enough rhubarb and raspberries so added some blueberries too and used tapioca flour for the instant tapioca. The sauce, after cooling, really glued itself to the pan(even though I greased it) so it was very hard to scoop out. Next time, besides a smaller pan, I will scrape the sides as soon as it's out of the oven and maybe that will help. The flavor was very delicious but it didn't make many servings.

Wonderful! I've made this recipe twice so far in the past week--once for my family (and it's nearly gone already) and again today for a pot luck, using both fresh rhubarb and raspberries from the garden. Everyone has loved it so far, and I'm planning to make it again for a party next week. Great recipe besides a few tweaks I had to make in the top layer due to the butter melting too fast. Any ideas on keeping the butter chilled (I already tried keeping it in the fridge until I was ready to use it)? Also, this recipe tastes good warm or cold plain, and warm with ice cream.

I read everyones reviews before I made this dessert. During the process I also made sure to listen to my partner who thought rhubarb was stringy. I cut 8 cups rhubarb and used 2 cups strawberries and coated them with double the cornstarch and double the tapioca but only 1.25 cups sugar. I left that to macerate and then thoroughly drained it. This is an important step. I doubled the crumb topping. It came out perfectly bubbly and not stringy at all. It was a hit served warm with vanilla ice cream.

We made this recipe for the 4th of July and my son's 4th birthday.  We added the raspberries, but also threw in some strawberries that we had leftover and it turned out great!  I also used a bit less sugar and it was still outstanding.  I am going to plant a rhubarb plant so we can have fresh rhubarb.  Fantastic!

This was killer!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white (perhaps my attempt at convincing my wife that this is a "healthy" dessert).  I also used a few more raspberries and cut them in half.

Excellent!  I cut the recipe in half since I didn't have enough rhubarb but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I brought it to work and three coworkers actually sat down at the table with forks and ate directly from the dish.  This is not behavior I've seen before!  Haha.  Very tasty!  Very easy.  I wish I had made more!

Awesome blend of sweet and tart with a tastey, crunchy topping!  My husband loves rhubarb and says this is the best dish he's ever had.  I doubled the ingredients for the topping which was very good and I've substituted strawberries in place of the raspberries and would recommend this combination, too.  Delicious summertime treat!

Tried this a few times now, once using raspberries and the second time using strawberries. Both times tasted great but each time the fruit mix bubbled over the crust and makes it look messy, I even doubled the crust both times.  Not sure what i'm doing wrong but it taste good either way...besides when you serve it up with some vanilla ice cream no one cares what it looks like.

WAY WAY WAY too much butter, next time I will use half the amount asked for. And maybe instead of so much white flour, grind some oatmeal in the blender to replace the wheat flour.  I also used less sugar. The blend of raspberries and rhubarb was excellent! I loved the flavour, just not the richness of this dessert. I bet the addition of almond extract would be awesome in this too!will try that next time.

My family loves this recipe. I use frozen rhubarb, and frozen rasperries, (I've also replaced the rasberries with strawberries, and/or mixed berries) and double the topping mixture. The amount is just perfect for an old 7 1/2 x 12 glass pan that I have had for years......I could eat the whole thing myself!  To bad I ghave to share!! Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I'm so thankful that I read the reviews before making this. I, too, added 2 T. of the tapioca, but I cut the sugar in half. It was still pretty sweet, but with our fresh, local raspberries, it was a hit. The ice cream didn't hurt, either!

This is a fantastic recipe, but I made a few changes.  I doubled the topping amounts and added chopped walnuts.  I also added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the fruit and doubled the amount of tapioca.  It disappeared in a flash. Thanks.

Excellent!  Great raspberry taste with only 1 cup.  I also used a 9x9 pan.  I will be using 2 tbsp. of tapioca next time.  It was not quite thick enough for our liking.

Loved it.  I added extra raspberries.  I will definitely make it again.  I shared the recipe with many of the other members of a club potluck. It totally disappeared off of the dessert table.

My husband loved this! I didn't have tapioca, so I didn't use it. I followed others' suggestions and ended up doing 4 cups or rhubarb AND berries, and then doubling the topping.

Loved it, hubby couldn't stop going back for extra bites!  I made a few tweaks based on other reviews and I think they are pretty essential (hence 4 stars instead of 5):
2 cups of raspberries
Doubled the topping

For healthy I stubstitued half the white sugar with stevia
I didn't have tapioca so I put in 3 tbsp of cornstarch

Served this with homemade whipped cream and it was to die for!

Will definitely make this again. I followed the reviews and doubled the recipe to fit in a 9x13 Pan, which worked perfectly. Next time I may use 3 c raspberries to 6 c rhubarb... but it tasted great as is. I was skeptical about the crumble as it didn’t come out as anticipated...was not as dry as expected but it turned out great! Best served day of. If you serve still warm plan for it to be runny... but either way, was AWESOME with vanilla ice cream! Enjoy!

I've made this several times.  The recipe can be adapted for any fruit in season.  For my friends who are diabetic I use Stevia instead of sugar.  This is a very easy and delicious recipe. LOVE IT!

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was just adding 1/2 cup more sugar due to the tartness of the rhubarb. This recipe is amazing.

This is my go-to recipe for all my fruit crisps. The ratio of the ingredients is just perfect for a crumble topping. Last month I made a fresh peach crisp, today is fresh strawberry and rhubarb. I always add a bit of cinnamon for flavor and chopped nuts for more crunch. You can’t go wrong with this one!

I used this as a guideline as I didn't have enough rhubarb.  I used a mixture of rhubarb, raspberries, strawberries and Saskatoon berries (the berries were previously frozen).  I used an extra 1/2 tablespoon of tapioca as the berries were very juicy after being thawed even after draining most of the liquid.    I also baked it an extra 10 minutes because of the juiciness.   It turned out very good and not too sweet.

simply the  best -- I may have used more filling ,as I was using up  frozen  rasp and  rhubarb   but made as is and used a  9 by 9 pan--I  baked about 45 minutes  - turned of oven an d  let it sit for 5.

  I  used only  1/3 cup butter as some said it was too buttery     and it came out perfect . It was  not too sweet ,but  just right . I  will be making this again .  The raspberries were  a surprised  combo-- at how well it went with  rhubarb.   great with scoop of ice cream on top -

Pretty good. Ended up making it with strawberries and raspberries, and used frozen rhubarb. Forgot to adjust for the additional moisture, so next time I will defrost the rhubarb first. My only complaint is that this was just way too sweet (and I have a big sweet tooth). Could cut way back on the sugar in the base and maybe add a splash of lemon juice. I'll try it again later and adjust my review to see what worked.

I made this exactly as is (except I doubled the recipe for the 9X13 pan) and it was perfect as is. Not too sweet at all. Perhaps it depends on how tart your berries are. Mine were from my own garden and likely more tart.

09.17.16 ~ Great dessert! I have a lot of rhubarb in the freezer and I pulled out a container of raspberries to thaw in the fridge a few days before making this recipe. Well......when I pulled the raspberries from the fridge, they turned out to be cherries. I didn't have a choice but to use them in this recipe. It turned out great and all got eaten, but I wanted raspberries. The topping is great on this dish and vanilla ice cream paired nicely on the warm dessert. I am making it again this weekend, using raspberries. This dessert was a great ending to a fantastic meal. We had 'Pineapple Sticky Ribs', homemade rolls, 'Cran-Broccoli Salad', and 'Buttery New Potatoes with Leeks and Parsley', all from AR. Thank you VSCOLE for sharing this recipe. It would work really well with many combinations of fruits. Definitely will be making this one again!

I was in a rush when I made this recipe. I had to use frozen rhubarb so I waited until the fruit was still frozen but the ice surrounding it was mostly thawed. The other reviewers are correct in that it will not fill a 9x13 pan; 9x9 is best. I added extra  frozen raspberries thinking I would be compensating for the loss of liquid from the rhubarb. I also doubled the topping ingredients. I baked it 10 mins. longer than required because it was still liquidy in the center. What I ended up with was more like an upside down berry bar~more dense than a crisp. It was very good with vanilla ice cream!

Great tasting recipe for this anti-cook!  I did read the reviews before proceeding, added a touch of vanilla to the berry mixture, and addied a pinch of cinnamon to the topping.  One thing that I WOULD recommend is using a smaller pan., 11x7 worked perfectly and produced a visual delight! Would fix it the same exact way again.

Delicious! Have made it twice - once with fresh rhubarb and frozen raspberries and the second time with frozen of both. Worked out well both times.  I have a fairly deep 9x13 (Pampered Chef baker) and it works well with double the recipe for the fruit and the topping. Have taken this to a potluck and the pan was emptied so quickly with raves about how yummy it was. Go ahead and make this - you won't be disappointed!

I loved this  but did make a few changes. Used stevia 1/2 cup instead of sugar, used 2 1/2 cups raspberries and tripled the topping. Used 3 tbsps  of corn starch instead of tapioca (didn't have any). Everything else I kept the same and used a 9x13 corning ware dish, filled it up and was delicious.

I love this recipe. It's my "go-to" recipe when the rhubarb starts overtaking my garden in the early summer! I have made it exactly as written (of course) and also substituted the raspberries for apples, peaches, strawberries, or blueberries. The result is perfect every time, regardless of whatever fruit you use. Also, I have made it with fresh or frozen rhubarb and it's still delicious. The amount of sugar can be adjusted depending on how sweet your rhubarb and other fruits are.
I do agree with other reviewers that this does NOT serve 24 people. More likely, 6 to 8... but maybe that's because "restraint" is not in my family's vocabulary.  :-)

This was excellent.  I thought you could cut down on the sugar a bit, but the other members of my family thought it was perfect.  Definitely a keeper!

This is quite good! 1) This should be for a 9x9 pan. It already seemed a little thin in the square pan, I can't imagine trying to stretch it out to a 9x13. 2) Way too much sugar and butter! I don't usually shy away from sweet and buttery, but even cutting back to 3/4 c. sugar and 1/3 c. butter, it was too much. Next time I'll try 1/2 c. sugar and 1/4 c. butter. Other than that, the flavors here are superb. I didn't have tapioca so I subbed another tablespoon of cornstarch--probably not necessary, it was super thick. I might try adding a little cinnamon to the topping next time.

This recipe is easy enough but turned out way too sweet and runny! If i were to make it again I would probably use half the amount of sugar in the dry mix and add more cornstarch.

This was excellent although I had to do some adjusting - I increased the raspberries to approx. 4 cups and reduced the rhubarb to approx. 2.5 cups only because that was the kind of quantities I had.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and baked in a 9 X 9 square pan.  Absolutely delicious - my husband said that it was the best raspberry crisp he had ever had and he would eat it all.............and he did except for a small corner square - and I do mean small.  And it was so easy - thanks so much!

The recipe as written gets three stars, for the reasons others have pointed out: too much sugar (I cut the granulated sugar by half); and it doesn't make nearly as much as the recipe says. I make it in an 8x8 pan, and it fits nicely. 

With those few tweaks, though, this makes a delicious crumble. I play with the fruits every time I make it, adding different berries, more berries than rhubarb, etc., and it always comes out great. 

The crumb-to-filling ratio is about 1:1, which is how I like it. But if you like more filling, cut the crumb back a bit.

Delicious!  I doubled recipe but only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  Baked in 9 x 13.  I've made with raspberries and strawberries and we enjoyed both.

I read all the reviews ... doubled the berries ... turned out runny ... and 45 minutes left the rhubarb a bit too crunchy to our taste.  But nice flavor!  I'd try it again.

We doubled the recipe and even added a bit more rhubarb along with blueberries and then it fit nicely into a 9x13 pan.  It did not thicken well and was a bit sweet.  If I had read the reviews first, I would have added more tapioca and 1/2 the sugar.  The ice cream added would be enough sweetener..  We had 6 very large servings and have about a third of a pan left.  So would say maybe 12 normal servings when doubled.

Fabulous recipe!!! I did double the crunch portion so I could have crunch on the top and bottom.  I also used  an 8 by 8 pan.

The fruit filling is fine but not enough for the size pan they recommend. I did not care for the topping. There's too much butter for the dry ingredients and it turns into a gelatinous mass instead of a bowlful of crumblies to spread across the top.

My sister made this for me for my birthday as I LOVE rhubarb.  The raspberry/rhubarb combo was out of this world.  I loved it and am thinking I'll make it for my MiL for Mother's Day.  This is one of my favorite desserts.

I had made the saskatoon-rhubarb pie on this site as my saskatoon tree was brimming with huge berries.  I didn't have enough pastry for two pies, so I mixed the rest with another 2 cups frozen rhubarb thawed,one tablespoon of tapioca, poured it into a round greased 9 inch cake pan, topped it with the crunch, baked as specified for 30 minutes and voila, a perfect desert.

This was a "10" from a very picky friend!  I added fresh peaches along with the raspberries and rhubarb. It was a perfect blend.  Throw a little vanilla bean ice-cream on the side and this easy recipe will always be a hit!
