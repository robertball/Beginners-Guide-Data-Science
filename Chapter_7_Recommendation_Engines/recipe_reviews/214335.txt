I substituted everywhere I could in this recipe for low fat/fat free or sugar free and my husband still is begging me to make it again.  Really delicious!

I made 3 of these for a church dinner, and people were grabbing them up before they got their dinner plates. ;) I loved the ease of mixing it up and the fact that it had no added sugar. I used roasted salted pecans and would proabably use unsalted next time, since I used salted butter in the crust. It makes a beautiful presentation, and the white chocolate and pecans really make this a special cheesecake.

Incredibly good, very rich but not too rich. I've made it five times in the last month (lots of birthdays)! I made a version with dark chocolate swirled into the batter, one with a fresh strawberry topping, one with fresh raspberries and raspberry jam, and one with the cherry pie filling, as directed in the recipe. Can't decide which one was my favorite; they were all great. The toasted pecans in the crust really add to the overall flavor.

I made this cheesecake just cause I thought it looked good. Between me and my husband, we both had it gone by the following day after I made it. I would highly reccommend you sit it overnight the refridgerator. I let it sit 4 hours like said... and all of the whipped topping leaked down the sides of the cake. Granite, it still tasted amazing... but itf you want it to look like the picture, make sure you let it cool in the fridge over night... every bit of 8 hours I would say. Also, I didn't add the pecans. My husband had his wisdom teeth out, and I was worried about how it would taste... but I just added about another 1/4 of a cup of graham cracker crumbs. It was the best cheesecake I've EVER had! My husband said it was so good it tasted like it was from The Cheesecake Factory (For all you cheesecake factory lovers). I would definitely try this. If you are thinking about it... go for it! You won't regret it!! Also... I couldn't find Honey maid graham crackers crumbs, so I used regular... I'm sure the honey maid makes it taste so much better, but the regular crumbs did just fine!! :)
