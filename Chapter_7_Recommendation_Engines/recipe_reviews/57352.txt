My hispanic father-in-law also gave me this recipe!  The only suggestion I have is he told me to use HOT water when you add it in.  This seems to help the texture.  Now my husband enjoys spanish rice the way he likes!
(Dry texture-not moist/mushy)

ï»¿This rice is exactly the kind of rice you will find in a "traditional" Mexican restaurant.  I am not sure
why a couple of people only gave this three stars.  Frankly, it was great!  Their complaints were that it was bland.  However, the point to this dish is that it is to be a side dish.  It has a mild flavor, but is to be an accompaniment to the main course.  I really liked it.

I really liked this! I halved it & cooked it in my rice cooker. Used 1/2 chicken broth mixed with the water. It cooked up beautifully. My 3 boys loved it!

Believe it or not, a lot of AUTHENTIC Mexican dishes are bland. If you choose recipes that are authentic you will either want to spice it up to your own taste, or just stay away from them altogether if you don't care for bland foods.
I happen to love authentic Mexican food and this rice dish is marvelous!

Living in Phoenix, we have had a chance to try MANY mexican / spanish rice dishes!  However, we feel this recipe really captures the "true" taste of how it's done!  I used real minced garlic, slightly less pepper, and the exact amount of ground cumin.  Be careful to not place more cumin than recipe calls for as it would be too strong a flavor & overtake the rice.  You can add salt to taste per individual taste after it's cooked.  We have declared this as our favorite family rice side dish!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I gave this a 3 because I'm actually not really sure what to rate it.  It's a good idea...it's the way my hubby said his abuela used to make rice.  However, he said it's supposed to be fluffy and this definitely didn't come out fluffy.  The flavor is right where it's supposed to be.  It's not supposed to have an overwhelming flavor, I guess.  This isn't spanish rice.  However, I'm looking for a way to make it fluffy...any suggestions?

Wonderful, simple rice, definitely best served as a jazzed-up side dish to accompany black beans, or quesadillas etc... I agree w/ other reviewers that it's a bit on the mild (no, no not bland!) side, but it is what it is -- a nicely-seasoned simple rice, that's more interesting that just plain ol' white rice. I made it as written, except that I toasted the rice dry, added the ingredients up to water, then added boiling water, so that upon being turned to low and covered, it was perfectly done to the right taste and texture in 20 min. Served it alongside chipotle chicken breasts with a sprinkle of green onions for color, and melty cheese. I would gladly make it again as a side to another Mexican entree.

This tastes exactly like the rice you can get at THE fast food chain. Perfect copycat. I found it to be dry and I have to agree with the others who said it's bland. It definitely needs more salt. Not sure I'd use this particular recipe again. If I did, major tweaking would be necessary.

I did the recipe exactly as stated and ran into one little snag.  I cooked the rice for the 20 minutes and when I opened the lid it was still really soupy.  I brought everything to a boil and then reduced the heat and simmered for 15 minutes (Just like you would prepare regular rice).  Hope this helps.

Very disappointed in this recipe. Turns out to be very very bland. The recipe on here called Mexican Rice II is MUCH better, and not bland at all.

This rice was delicious!  It helps to have a heavy stainless steel pan to heat rice evenly when browning.  I really enjoyed this rice.  I just added a few tablespoons of onion in with the garlic and also added a large chicken boiullion.  Garnish with fresh cilantro and lime wedges.  Thanks for a great easy recipe!

Pretty good! I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used petite diced tomatoes, undrained and it worked out well.  We ate this with enchiladas for dinner :)

Good basic recipe--it tastes as if it should be one of those things you can make without a recipe, but since I'd never made it before finding the recipe and hadn't even thought ot adding the ingredients together for a dish--it obviously needs the recipe. So, here's my review--good side dish but not shocking or unique in taste--don't think this will be the star of your meal. BUT it will be a delicious side dish that enhances an amazing main dish.

I made this with brown rice instead of white, otherwise as written. I fought the urge to add some butter (I'm a Southern girl!), but wish I had given in! Definitely needs additional salt and maybe some onion. I would make it again with those additions.

I started to make this, only to realize that I didn't have any tomato sauce.  But I did have some salsa, so I used that instead.  Rice turned out wonderful, with great flavor, and was a perfect side dish to our chicken enchiladas.

For AUTHENTIC Mexican/Spanish Rice this is good.  I will agree with a poster from below.  Authentic Mexican food is very bland.  I grew up in the midwest where everything is very spiced up.  I moved to Arizona and went to many Authentic Mexican restaraunts and nothing tasted "right", only because my right was wrong. If you know what I mean.  So I tend to stay away from authentic except for the carnitas.  If you are used to Chi Chis, taco bell and O'd mexico type establishments this isn't going to be the type of rice you are looking for.  Sorry  But this is exactly how my sister in law makes her rice and I have been looking for it.  Very simple.  Great with chicken.  I add a can of mixed vegis drained,

Traditional and very good--it turned out perfect.  I added finely diced onion halfway through browning the rice.  I suggest increasing the salt and cutting back on the pepper, though.

We have tried several rice recipes.....this is our favorite.  Came out fluffy, not mushy like others.  Did use HOT water too, maybe that's why?  You do need to add salt, was a little bland, but was nice to alter to our taste...added a spicy salt mix.  We will definately use this recipe again!

I have been looking for a recipe that could duplicate the rice I get at my favorite authentic mexican restaurant (over 2 hours away).  This comes VERY close.  They add diced carrots to theirs...had I done that I would not have been able to tell the difference.  I used medium grain rice and toasted it until golden.  I worried about the amount of water when I added it but it definitely needs it so don't skimp.  Excellent recipe...thank you for sharing!

It was dry and sticky with no taste. I added one 16 oz. jar of picant sauce. And some taco sauce.Which gave it some taste..
Will not make again.

Love this! I usually use chicken broth instead of water for extra flavor. I have made this rice multiple times and each time my family compliments me on it. I think it has more flavor than most rices from Mexican restaurants.

This was okay; I was kind of disappointed. It lacked alot of seasoning. I had to add salt at the table because it was still bland. I think next time I'll try a different recipe. By the way, it makes A LOT!

This rice recipe had a strong tomato aroma, and it lacked in flavor. In actuality, I felt it almost had a sour taste to it.

I was surprised by how bland this was. We couldn't taste the spices or tomato sauce. The rice was clumpy.

Very bland, will not make again.  Perhaps as a filler for burritos or enchilada's but as a side it lacked flavor.  It makes an aweful lot of rice too!

started with a Mexican brand rice. the only tomato sauce i had was low sodium, so increased the salt to 1/2 t. had just under 3 C "no chicken broth", so added water to make up the difference. threw in half an onion because of personal taste, and a jalapeno for color and heat. after twenty minutes it had cooked perfectly, but filled up my largest skillet, so next time i will use a stockpot. it was fluffy and exactly the taste i was hoping for :)

I followed the recipe to the "T" and #1 it didn't cook.  I had to bring the mixture to a boil first, then let simmer.  #2 it didn't have much flavor on it's own.  It would be great in a burrito or as a base to something else, but we were disappointed in it as a plain side.  Sorry.

This rice is yummy. This was my first time making Mexican rice, and being such a big Mexican food fan, I'm impressed with this recipe. I didn't really measure any of my spices/ salt/ pepper, and I added some green bell pepper. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good rice. I'll use this again for sure. My DH wrapped this in his flour tortillas along with the seasoned meat. Perfect for picky eaters too as there is no onion, no green peppers, and no chunks of tomatoes in this. I used the juice I drained from the fire roasted tomatoes I was using for an accompanying salsa for this instead of the tomato sauce. I used morelos rice and garlic powder. I've also done this as written with the tomato sauce and with minced garlic, still great but a tad better with the changes I had to do the other time. Thanks so much Txcookingprincess, I loved grandma's rice!

Used brown rice and chicken stock instead of water came out great. Added peas and topped with green onion when I served.

This was ok, just an average side dish. I found it bland after it was done so I sauteed some onions and added some more cayenne, another clove of garlic, and some more salt and pepper and mixed it in with the rice. That improved it a lot. I'd probably make it again with these modifications.

I doubled the amount of minced garlic, added 1 tsp. of chili powder, and 3/4 of a cup of finely minced onion.  I got these ideas from other recipes I looked at.  My family loved the recipe with these additions.

I made a couple of changes. I reduced water by 1 C to make upmade this for tomatoe sauce and added 1tsp chipolte in adobe sauce.  I also cooked this rice using the method in Oven Baked Rice from this website. Use the method all the time and get perfect rice every time.

Taste wasn't that bad, I added crushed garlic and a bit of garlic salt, a sprinkle of salt. The rice was soupy. I will be using less water, in fact, I will be substituting water with chicken broth to give it a better flavor.

This recipe is tastes exactly like my mom (from Mexico) and my Abuelita's rice.  Well, I guess I don't remember my mom ever putting minced garlic in, she used garlic powder.  It is a family favorite.  I was looking for a good Mexican rice recipe on here one night when I couldn't get a hold of my mom for hers.  I used hot water and sauteed the onions with the rice, other than that I followed recipe exactly.  Tastes like home to me!

I didn't really care for this... It had an odd flavor that I didn't associate with Mexican rice. Try the Spanish Rice II recipe on this site instead, which is what I'm used to when making tomato-y rice.

I followed the directions on this and found that it makes a TON of rice - way more than I expected.  That was ok since I was trying the recipe out before serving it for a party, but in the end the family didn't like it enough to serve it again so I'll have to find something else.  We did find it to be bland, but I'm not sure if that's the recipe or if that's just how it is supposed to taste.  I would expect it to have more flavor even as a side dish.

Best spanish rice I've ever made and so easy! I browned my rice in a pan on the stove and added the salt, pepper, garlic & cumin. I finished it off in my rice cooker. Came out dry and fluffy.

While this recipe is pretty simple to make, the taste is actually quite bland.  It would have benefited from a bit more garlic or possibly some onions.

Not quite sure what I did wrong, I followed the directions exactly, but I ended up with a soupy mess. I tried boiling for 15 minutes like another reviewer suggested but the rice was done for. Won't be making this again!

Very good dish!  However, I changed the way of cooking the rice since I was using par-broiled rice for this recipe.  I boiled the rice before adding to the skillet to brown it for 1 minute.  Adding cumin to the mix is a great idea; the rice turned out very tasty as a result.  I will definitely try this recipe again.

Very good, but after adding the water, you may want it to boil before turning heat down and putting on lid.  It soaks up more of the liquid.

this was a great side dish.  We put in tortilla's with fajitas.  The recipe makes a huge serving and for two average adults it was WAY to much food.

This recipe is simple and delicious. I added chopped onions for added flavor.
My family loves this as a side dish served with refried beans and tacos.

MY husband even went for seconds and he does not care for rice.
