This recipe was amazing! The spice mixture is phenomenal. I made minor changes. Specifically, I cut the amount of oil/butter in half, I used ground cardamom (following the cook's footnote), and I removed the bay leaf and cinnamon stick before blending. I still have leftovers in the refrigerator, but I am already thinking about when I can make this again! Thank you so much for posting!

Excellent recipe. I usually have all of the ingredients in the house, so I make this on days when I am low on groceries.  I have made homemade paneer, which elevates this dish to 5 stars easily, but even with frozen, store-bought paneer it is still an elegant, delicious dish.

I have made this 3 times now and it is one of my all time favorite dishes!!  It is a flavor explosion, fresh and authentic.  I pull the bay leaves and cinnamon stick before processing the sauce; the cloves, pepper, cardamom and coriander grind up fine and I wouldn't want to miss the extra bold spices.

Tasted very good. Recommend that you boil the potatoes before adding to the pot. Also, I used an immersion blender to purée the sauce.  I also substituted a few powdered spices for the fresh.  I did make a special trip to a local Indian grocer for the Paneer.

Processed the sauce for nearly ten minutes and the spices would not grind up in my food processor. What I’ll probably do next time is leave out the bay leaves and dry roast the rest of spices in a pan, let cool and grind up in my spice grinder then add bay leaves while cooking.

Really good recipe, moderately spicy. I only had small russet potatoes, so I used three, which was too much. I probably added the full 1/2 cup water. I will use less potato next time, and also boil or parboil them before adding to the sauce (I used a wide pan, so the sauce was too shallow to cover the potatoes). Potato issues aside, this made a tasty vegetarian meal with basmati rice and gobi stuffed parathas. Also, I used clarified butter (ghee).

Talk about burn a tongue with chilly and undercooked potatoes.
