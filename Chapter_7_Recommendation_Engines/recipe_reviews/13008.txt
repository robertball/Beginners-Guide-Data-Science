I switched the numbers for the potatoes and sweet potatoes so that there are more sweet potatoes. I also used 1 10 oz. can of broth and cut the water to compensate. Cut the thyme and add 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped cilantro, 2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp. curry powder and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. Increase the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups. Garnish with cilantro and sour cream instead of chives. Brilliant.

This had a great color and consistency. I expected a more earthy, filling quality, but it's even better the next morning. You could make it entirely vegetarian by using vegetable broth. Oh, I forgot to mention that I do this in the slow cooker: Peel and chop your root veggies and let them cook in the broth on high for 4-6 hours. Reduce the heat to LOW, add the spices and buttermilk and cook for another hour. Use an immersion blender to pur√©e it all. It's easier than transferring it to a traditional blender

This is a very exotic soup: the spices give it a wonderful Middle Eastern flavor.  Its thick enough that it could almost be used as a party dip with pita bread...  Guaranteed to impress!

I had a sweet potato bisque when I was back in college that reminded me a lot of pumpkin pie -- I was hoping that this recipe might get me something similar.  I made a few changes to start -- I upped the number of sweet potatoes to 4, and regular potatoes to about 2.5.  I used regular baking potatoes, but I think Yukons might work better next time.  Along with the onions and garlic, I sauteed about a 1/3 cup carrots.  I decreased the water to 6 cups, and made up the difference with chicken stock.  After the spices were added, I also added about 3/4 cup brown sugar (slightly too much), about 1 generous tablespoon cinnamon, and a full pint of lowfat buttermilk.  While the spices do give this dish a zing, the sweet potato flavor is sorely lacking.  I will likely up the number of sweet potatoes next time to 5 or 6, and definitely cut back on the amount of regular potatoes, nutmeg and thyme as they were a bit overpowering.

I found this to be a little bland. Perhaps could have used more broth and less water?

I expected more flavor from this recipe. The taste of the sweet potatoes was minmal even though they were roasted to carmelize the sugars and enhance the flavor. The ratio of broth to water should be bit higher. I added a little brown sugar and hot paprika later which raised the recipe from 3 to 4 stars.

This was good.  I did it with about 9 sweet potatoes (no regular potatoes), about 6 or 7 cups of milk and no water or chicken stock, a cup of apple juice, subbed garam masala, chili powder,fresh grated nutmeg, & cumin for the other spices.  Added a little brown sugar at the end.  It was just sweet and spicy enough for us.  I think the buttermilk was the only thing i kept, and it was good.  I just added some vinegar to a couple cups of milk and put that in at the end after pureeing.  I will keep this but I would never make it with just water.  I like creamy soup.

This was a wonderfully creamy soup. I served it with a crusty baguette bread at a 5 course meal to a bunch of girls at camp. They loved it! It was missing something, however. I never quite put my finger on what it was actualyl missing, but something was a little off. It was still wonderful!

The proportions on this seem very off.  The recipe says it serves eight but it made a lot more than that.  This sounded really good but turned out quite dissapointing.

A really interesting and tasty soup.  I replaced two of the sweet potatoes with carrots when I realized I didn't have as many leftover baked sweet potatoes as I thought.  Still a delicious recipe though.

Sorry, just wasn't for me.  I don't even think that it was the recipe necessarily. I guess I just don't care for this in general. I found it to be rather drab and just not worth it. (I like sweet potatoes, but they just don't seem to be enough to pull off a soup.)

I was very disappointed by this soup.  It smelled SO good when I was making it but there seems to be far too much water.  It turned out very bland and in order to save my efforts I threw in a package of dry veggie soup mix.

Man 'o Man!  What a treat on a cold winter night.  I made this bisque for a pot luck but I couldn't help sneaking a bowl before taking it to my sister's place.  Bland?  I think not!

Recipe was good. Like some other reviews, I felt it was a little bland. I added 1/4 cup brown sugar (not enough) and added a little salt and it seemed to help a little. Now that I've made it once, if I ever make it again I would use fresh ingredients instead of dry. I know it says 8 servings, but I got 12 out of it and people were very satisfied.

I should have read the reviews first. Wayyyyy too watery! Cut the water and maybe even increase the potatoes and sweet potatoes or add other vegetables for more of a bisque texture.

Probably only used about 8C of liquid and replaced half of that with chicken stock (just added more water until it was a consistency we liked).  Also used 4 sweet potatos and 3 large white potatos.  Very nice and lots of flavor.

I didn't like this at all but hubby liked it.  If I make this again, I will be trying it before I add the buttermilk and spices to see which spice didn't agree with it.
