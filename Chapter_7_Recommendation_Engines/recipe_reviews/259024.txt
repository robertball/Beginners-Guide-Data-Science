I was looking for a good meatloaf recipe that did not have bread in it. I saw this and decided to try it. I thought it was really delicious but I do have to say I made a few changes. I did not put the eggs inside of it and I didnâ€™t have the almond. I added cheddar cheese instead. My family loved it.
