I used homemade unsweetened applesauce (made from Jonathan apples) in this recipe. Once I was able to get the pumpkin grated, this was quite simple and this turned out wonderfully. I will make this again but try it with pumpkin spice next time.

It's delicious.  I made it with homemade unsweetened applesauce and omitted the sugar.  I don't miss the sugar a bit and it is much more healthy.

This is a great base that can be used in other recipes as well as eaten on its own.  I doubled the recipe freezing half of it. I used homemade unsweetened applesauce and red kuri pumpkin.  I also cut down on the sugar by half in one batch.  I then used it to replace oil in AR's Pumpkin Pie Muffins and it turned out moist and pumpkin rich! Thanks sueb for sharing.
