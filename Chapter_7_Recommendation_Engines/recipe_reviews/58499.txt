I found this WAY TOO SWEET.  I will definitely cut the amount of sugar the next time.  Also after tasting it, I thought it was missing something, and I read the ingredients off of the empty bottle of store bought chili sauce that I had.  I then added 1/4tsp. of onion powder, 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp. of chili powder.  It really improved it.  (Besides, I don't know why you would name a recipe 'chili sauce' when there's no chili in it.)

Oh my... this makes unbelievably good sloppy joes!  Sassy!  I subbed chili powder for the allspice.  Hubby and school-aged kids all loved it.  (Mom, too)

This recipe is really close to store bought chili sauce.  I added some of this to my homemade barbecue sauce and it worked great.  I don't think I will ever buy store bought chili sauce again.

Used this recipe to substitute the jar of chili sauce in "Cocktail Meatballs." Next time, I think I will add 1/4 tsp of onion powder, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of chili powder as proudwifeandmommy suggested.

Thank you I will never buy chili sauce again. Needed it in my chili and did not want to hit the store. Tasted great! And no high fructose corn syrup!

I needed chili sauce in a recipe for "simply the easiest beef brisket" from this website and didn't have any.  This worked very well.  Thanks!

Always needed to run to store to get chili sauce for a recipe, and this is much cheaper and tastes great!  I let it sit in fridge so flavors could blend....very good on my meatloaf!  I did use just a tablespoon and a half of the sugar.

I don't really know what the jarred kind of chili sauce tastes like, but this worked great for my purposes today.  I needed chili sauce in a recipe for maple meatballs and they turned out really well with this sauce in them.  I'm looking forward to trying the rest of it in another recipe.  Thank you!

Good recipe!  I never think to buy chili sauce so I never have it on hand.  I always have these four ingredients on hand, though, and just make it up as I need it.  Much less expensive this way, too.  Thanks!

Just ok as is.  With reviewer comments about being too sweet I halved the brown sugar and added about 1/2tsp each of onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder and a pinch of salt.  It's certainly better that way and avoids all that high fructose corn syrup.  I'll try it again.

This can be a good recipe with a LOT of additions.  It was far too sweet even though I only added 1 tbs of brown sugar.  I also ended up adding garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, red pepper flakes, salt, coarse black pepper, soy sauce and a dash of hot pepper sauce.  NOW it tastes like what I think chili sauce should taste like.  With these additions I will continue to make it.

I don't think I've ever purchased commercial chili sauce so I don't know if this was right or not.  I needed some for Jeff's Sloppy Joes (AR Recipe) so I threw this together.  I used one 8 oz can of tomato sauce which isn't quite one cup so I scaled back the other ingredients.  It worked for my needs!

Great substitute for Heinz Chili Sauce at a mere fraction of the price!  I added just a bit more vinegar and a shake of chili powder.  Excellent recipe!

I prefer this to store bought chili sauce since it is an ingredient I donâ€™t use often. I can reduce the sugar by substituting Splenda brown sugar for the brown sugar.

Just what I was looking for. I used tomato paste + water as the base. Also I replaced the allspice with paprika (I ran out of chili powder) and added some tabasco sauce. Furthermore, I boiled it in a saucepan for a few minutes to meld the flavors together. I know it seems like I am rating an entirely different recipe, but this got me going in the right direction, and for that I tip my hat.

Tasted just like BBQ sauce. I made it exactly as written, and it was just way too sweet, even for BBQ! After that went over like a led balloon, I added onion powder, garlic powder, salt, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, Asian mustard and hot sauce. I don't know what it turned into but it was much better than originally written. I was putting it over meatballs.

So easy and so great! I needed Chili sauce for cocktail meatballs on Thanksgiving and I made this sauce and it was so easy to make and was fantastic. I also think it is cheaper to make this sauce than to buy it! Great Recipe!

This was really good. I used it on the lentils (as recommended) when I made Glazed Corned Beef with Lentils from this site. I don't use onions or onion powder (because we have dogs, and they usually get some of what I cook, too) and I didn't add any garlic (because I had already added that to the water in which I cooked my lentils). I also substituted a bit of Cumin and a few shakes of Mrs. Dash's Southwest Chipotle blend for the allspice (I had it on hand, but ti rarely does anything for me), and it was great. I was skeptical (to say the least) about how all of the flavors that comprised this dinner would blend, but there wasn't a scrap left at the end of the meal. (I'm glad I threw in some potatoes with the lentils).

Yummy, this worked well in a recipe that called for chili sauce.  It would also work well as a dipping sauce for some Indian appetizers.

I love how I didn't have to go to the store to buy a bottle of chili sauce for another recipe. I mixed this up following others' suggestions (decreasing brown sugar to 2 T. and adding 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. onion powder, and 1/2 tsp. chili powder) and had my homemade chili sauce in mere minutes.

In a flash, this recipe will do. It's not thick, like jar stuff but, it so helps when your in a pinch. And that's where I was at. On a lighter note, it is a bit sweet. And I've made this a couple of times. This last time I goofed and used a can of Hot Mexican Tomato Sauce by mistake and while the sweet was there, so was the slight burn..my bad ;-) But again, in a pinch. This works.

This is a great substitute for the store bought version. I took the suggestion of proudwifeandmommy by adding the spices she suggested and cut back on the brown sugar. I also added the following spices: 

1/4 tsp cloves
1/8 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp ginger

I am sure this is far better than the bottled sauce.  My issue is not with the above photo (which has to be this recipe) but with the photo that 'hooked me' into looking at the recipe.  That photo looked like Thai sweet chili sauce, which I would like to prepare at home.  The wrong photo is frequently shown with a recipe, I have discovered!

I thought this recipe was great, I needed chili sauce for a recipe and instead of running to the store I was recommended this!!  The only thing I did different was added about 1 teaspoon of salt.  Thanks for sharing!

Thanks for this. I needed some for vegetables tonight and had no idea how to make my own. This is fine the way it is but I may try it with the garlic etc. like others suggested too.

I made this when I discovered too late that I did not have any from the store.  It is better than the bottled kind and I will make my own from now on. Great recipe.  Thanks.

Wow! This recipe is really tasty and simple! Did I mention cheap?  

I used it instead of buying a bottle of chili sauce for my homemade vegetarian chili, and I must say, YUMMY!

I'm not familiar with chili sauce, but the Baha Mama Chops recipe called for it, so I tried this recipe.  It worked really well, and I'll make it again.  I added some rice wine vinegar, and really liked the extra sweetness.

A little too sweet for my taste, but it works!  It does taste like sweet chilli sauce bought from a store!  Will definitely be making this again with that slight change! Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this sauce to use in the "Easy Sloppy Joes" recipe. I didn't have the jar of chili sauce on hand. My husband like this version much better. It's super easy to make, too.

I couldn't find any allspice so I used about 1/2 teaspoon of mixed chili powder and crushed Italian seasonings. That worked VERY well!

very easy to make with ingredients I usually have around the house.  Surely less expensive than buying ready made.  I also added some chile powder.

This is a great and a very quick chili sauce recipe!  I've made it many times and I am very happy that it is an inexpensive, but very good substitute for jarred chili sauce.  At first I made it only when I was out of jarred chili sauce, but now I don't even bother to buy chili sauce any more.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!!  I love it!

The first time I made this recipe, I needed chili sauce for another recipe and I'm very glad I stumbled across it! It is a very sweet sauce and I used the leftover sauce for crockpot sloppy joes. They were fabulous! The second (and 3rd and 4th and 5th) I used chili powder instead of allspice, added granulated garlic and a bit more salt to cut some of the sweetness as I personally prefer savory over sweet; hubby loved it either way! Great recipe and is now a staple in my home!

I needed chili sauce to make "grape jelly meatballs" and didn't have time to run to the store.  Luckily this recipe was here!  I felt it lacked something - ended up adding 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and an additional Tbsp of vinegar.  Still not quite right.  Finally I settled on just over 1/2 tsp of prepared horseradish.  That gave it enough kick to work for me.   Thanks for posting this as I was in a bind!

Good sauce, but I will follow others advice next time and add a few things. Thought it needed just a little something else with spices. Won't buy the jarred stuff anymore when I can make this so quickly and inexpensively.

Great substitute for store bought.  "Chili" sauce has nothing to do with the spice "chili"  Chili sauce is basically used as a condiment.  Mixed with mayonaise or miracle whip makes a great Thousand Island dressing.  Also great in liew of the more spicy barbeque sauce on ribs.  I also use it over an appetizer spread made of cream cheese and canned salmon.  Ellenmel, I am so glad you submitted this as I no longer purchase prepared chili sauce because it contains high fructose corn syrup and I use it on many things.

I use recipe this for my homemade party meatballs.  This recipe is quick and easy and is so much better than having the bottled stuff on hand that just goes bad b/c we don't use it enough!  I combine this with the Cranberry Sauce II (sal) and Cocktail Meatballs (Lara) recipes on this site.

I only had about half the commercial chili sauce that I needed and couldn't go to the store.  The flavour of this sauce is pretty close, but it certainly isn't as thick as the commercial sauce.  Perhaps reducing it on the stove or using crushed tomatoes might fix this.  That being said, this recipe saved my meal.  Thank you.

I made this recipe "as is", and it has a really good flavor.  I added garlic powder and chili powder to it, but it tastes great both ways!

This is so easy--I made it with crushed tomatoes because that's all I had. The best thing is there are no preservatives or MSG!!!!

Very good as is! I hate buying the bottled stuff. I added a couple shakes of cayenne to give it a punch, as that is the way I like it. Thanks for the recipe!

Read the  other reviews... only used 2 tbsp sugar, added 1 tsp chili powder,onion powder, cumin and garlic powder. Omitted allspice. Tastes great.

I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, added 1/4 teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, all spice, ginger, chili powder. Tossed in  some minced onions. Great on top of meat loaf an very good for sloppy joes!

Easy useful recipe. When made as is it is a little too sweet. Too much allspice too. I added chili, garlic and onion powders like another reviewer suggested and it was better. Next time I will try halving the allspice, adding the extra spices and white sugar instead of brown.

Oooh my!!! Thank you for this recipe! Wanted to do sweet & sour meatballs for dinner and didn't want to drive to the store ;) You saved the day. I'll never buy store bought chili sauce again! I was also out of allspice, mixed up my own and followed your recipe exactly.

I followed Pam's adjustments and liked the flavor.  This sauce definitely has to sit for a few hours to meld the favors.  Next time, will add horseradish for a little kick.

Sorry even after all of the suggested additions, this was not eaten at our house and I ended up throwing it out in it's entirety.  I thought it would taste better after a day or so but the sauce ended up congealing...so I had chili sauce jello!  Thanks for the post though... I do like trying new recipes.

Decent and definitely gets points for being simple.  Definitely would benefit from some add-ins to give it more flavor.

This recipe is great.  I did not want to go to the store to get just chili sauce.  So I looked up chili sauce recipes and try this one.  I am sure glad that I did.  I put in my own taste by adding what I like. but followed this pretty close.  It turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe

This worked perfectly for the 'Remoulade Sauce a la New Orleans' recipe from here. I did scale the recipe back jsut to make as much as I needed. I would never hesitate to use this recipe in place of store bought bottled chili sauce, as it was pretty much identical! Thanks for sharing. :)
