This recipe has potential. It had ok flavor but could have been much better with a few changes. The lemon grass was overwhelming and it tasted like it was missing something. Next time I would not have processed the lemon grass and left them in big pieces then you wouldn't have to strain the sauce at the end. I would use pineapple juice instead of water to add a sweet taste to it. I also would put a few drops of water in the cornstarch before adding it to the pan.  Serve with grilled pineapple and a few chunks of red bell pepper and you have a great sweet and spicy chicken.
