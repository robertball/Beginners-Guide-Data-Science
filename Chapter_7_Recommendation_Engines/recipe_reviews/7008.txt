My husband had requested cherry kolache for his birthday breakfast, and this looked like the best option.

This is an excellent recipe for kolach. My daughter said that they were the best she's ever had. We live in a town with a lot of Czech heritage, so that means something. I ended up using 5 and 3/4 cups of flour, because the dough was so moist, but they were still extremely light and tender

To prevent burning, I baked them on an insulated cookie sheet. That worked very well. 

 I also followed the idea of another poster, and turned a dozen of them into "breakfast" kolach, with finely chopped onion, kielbasa, eggs and 2% sharp cheddar loosely scrambled. The loose, moist scramble set firm in the kolach baking process.

This recipe's a keeper.

My husband is from a Czech background.  He's says these are pretty darn close to how grandma used to make them.  I guess that's a great rating!

I grew up in Texas near a little town called Snook and twice a month on Saturday morning we drove there to the bakery with the best kolaches and sausage rolls. I now live in Florida and get homesick for those tasty treats, the picture looks just like the ones I remember and the recipe was right on. I did not have any lemon when I made my second batch, so I used vanilla in it's place it was still wonderful. I am going to use the dough next weekend for the sausage rolls. Do you have a recipe for the cream cheese filling?

This was a very easy recipe, but as tasty as the kolaches my mom used to make. I experimented with fillings and decided that this recipe does best with a savory filling. I also tried All Fruit instead of preserves (didn't work out) and cream cheese danish filling (which was delicious).

Excellent! I was a little hesitant about the lemon extract but did it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. It added a fresh little bit of citrus to a perfectly sweet dough. Thanks so much!

These were really good! I halved the recipe as there's only 2 of us to eat them, but ended up having a  bit of trouble. I needed 3/4c more flour than the recipe called for, though as this is only my second foray into yeast breads, I suspect the fault was with me rather than the recipe. Now that I've figured out the flour issue, I'll definitely make these again. Pretty easy and very delicious.

This is a great recipe and easy to make. I made some for my co-workers and they loved it. The lemon is the key to this recipe.

This was an easy, no-knead sweet roll recipe.  I still had a little trouble with it, but I'm new to yeast breads.  The rolls didn't rise well on my baking stones, but overall turned out nicely.  The rolls rose much better on my metal pans, but the bottoms burned.  It's not a terribly sweet roll, the preserves add the sweetness to it.  I tried substituting Smuckers 100% Fruit for the preserves, but won't do that again.  It doesn't bake as well as preserves do. I might make this again.

Updathe*******I make these kolaches at least twice a month and usually 4-6 dozen at a time.  I used the larger cheddar ekrich smok-y breakfast links (they are fully cooked and come in a 12 pack) and the dough makes 2 dozen, which since I eyeball it, some are bigger than others.  Once my breadmachine is done, I divide into 24 pieces, roll them out into rectangle shapes and roll the link into the dough and just seal the seam, usually the link sticks out some at each end,  then I proof them in my oven on warm for 30 minutes.  Take them out long enough for my oven to heat to 325-350 and bake for 7-10 minutes until brown, brush with butter and serve, or COMPLETELY cool and store in fridge.  HUMIDITY is huge in how much flour I add when rolling out.  I also find leaving the butter soft and adding it in the exact order listed in the recipe works best for me.

Sorry. These were like biscuits with jelly in the middle. Not at all like the kolaches we were looking for. The kolaches we have had are more like a roll or donut dough. Followed the recipe exactly as written. Will try another recipe.

I have been making kolaches for many years since my husband's family are from Czech origin.  This recipe passed the family test, all of them thought this recipe was excellent. I use poppy seed and apricot preserves in the recipe. I did turn the oven down to 400 degrees and did have to watch them very closely, but as stated previously, they were excellent.

These turned out great. I didn't have lemon extract so used lemon zest, which was fine. I watched them very closely as not to burn the bottoms. Started out with a 400 degree oven, then turned it up for the next batch. Didn't take long for them to bake. Would bake them again but want to try Solo filling. I didn't feel these tasted like a biscuit as another person suggested. They raised light and high. Biscuits are kind of dry but these weren't.

These are very good.  I used a peach preserve and a blackberry.  Very tasty.  I like the other users had to use a little additional flour.  PLEASE watch carefully in the oven.  These burn very quickly on the bottom even though they are only slightly brown on the top.  Next time I make these, I may go down a few degrees on the oven.  I will make these again.  They were very tender.

YUMMY! I made fresh peach pie filling, and an  apple cranberry filling to top them with. Also, I made them MUCH bigger than suggested. I used around 1/3 cup dough per kolache and baked them on a silicone liner (keeping a close eye on the bottoms because they definitely do brown more quickly than one might plan on). After removing from the oven, I drizzled them with glaze and then ducked while the family ran me over to get to them. :) They turned out tasting like something half way between a donut and a danish.  Soft, sweet and lovely. Next time, I'm going to put some cream-cheese filling (like one would make for a cheese cake, only thicker I think) under the fruit filling. 
Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Followed recipe as written and results were not what I was hoping for.  These are not like the kolaches we have in Central Texas.  Sorry, but these were more like biscuits than kolaches.  Will not make again.

Texans love Kolaches - an old favorite made famous at a bakery in West, TX.  It is an old Czech recipe and I have to say, they are pretty darn close to the ones I used to buy.  I have made them over and over again but love the ones with spicy sausage in the middle of the bun.  Just eliminate the lemon extract and fruit and instead wrap the dough around the sausage (seam down), let rise again and bake...but watch the oven as they bake quickly.  Yum.

This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! I've tried several different kolache and biscuit recipes and this is by far the best. I tried them  as written, and also with sausage (minus the lemon extract)...both were wonderful!

I just made these for our Christmas family gathering and it was a hit! It turned out better than I would have dreamed of!! The dough was perfect-even the next day, still soft and moist. Just amazing! I used apple, cherry and blueberry pie filling and some were made with cream cheese too. They were all so good. Thank you!!

My grandfather was Czech and this is the same recipe my grandmother made when we would visit her in Kasnsas. She often did prune (my favorite as a kid) and cottage cheese fillings. My husband likes the poppy seed and my daughter likes apricot, cherry and raspberry. If you are from Texas and used to what they call kolaches...you won't like this recipe. This recipe is perfect for Czechs from Kansas. :-)

These came out very well. The direction to watch is essential, though. Mine took about 13 minutes, but just a few seconds over and a couple of them burned on the bottom. Easy to do a keeper.

This was my first attempt ever at a yeast bread recipe of any sort. I read all of the reviews and followed the instructions to a tee and voila, they came out great! I found that ten minutes was a good cooking time, raise your racks up high in the oven to keep from burning the bottoms, and have fun with it. Next time I'll make them a little smaller, about the size of a golf ball. As you can see, we tried all different fillings. There's strawberry, peach and raspberry preserves, sweet orange marmalade, and even leftover sausage from this morning's breakfast with some shredded cheddar. My wife loves cinnamon so we topped a few with that and some butter. Well worth the effort to make, can't wait to see how my Sunday morning group likes 'em. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I had been craving Kolaches and this recipe hit the nail on the head and wasn't even hard to make.  I followed the recipe exactly, but did end up using a little flour to make the dough easier to handle when I was forming it into balls.  I baked mine for 8 minutes (the recipe says to bake until browned and to watch carefully).  I'm very glad to have found this recipe!
