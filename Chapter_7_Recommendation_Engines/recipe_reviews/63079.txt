Very yummy. The dough was too soft to form a round with my hands so I got a wooden spoon and scooped it onto the plastic wrap and formed the round that way. I also kept it in the freezer for longer than it took me to make the fudge filling (washed up, admired husbands handiwork in the garden, took a phone call from my sister ) probably about 30 mins. I got 20 cookies from the recipe but I do tend to be a bit generous with my servings. Everyone enjoyed. Thanks.
