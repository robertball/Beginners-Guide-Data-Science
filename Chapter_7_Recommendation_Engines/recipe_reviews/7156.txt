After using this format, the recipe is very good with some modifications. First off, it should never be called SF Sourdough Bread for the same reasons as mentioned before, PLUS - I live in San Francisco, and we rarely see bread served with onion on top of sourdough. Other specialty breads, yes, but to us, that's corrupting the true SF style sourdough. It should simply be called "Onion-Topped Sourdough". Second, I HIGHLY recommend using water instead. Real SF Sourdough never has milk, and use can sugar and sea salt for improved flavor. The yeast is marginal, as it's not often used here. That's supposed to be why the starter is used, but it doesn't rise correctly unless you use 1 cup starter per loaf and extend the rise time out to 2-3 hours in a warm oven. Also use Unbleached flour for denser bread (more like SF). Next, use ONLY the egg white to lightly brush on top of the loaf right before baking, not with the yolk. Last, there's no mention in the recipe what to do with the last Tbsp of water. I'd omit that, as the egg white does not need water added. If you want closer to authentic SF Sourdough, don't use the onion. After those modifications, you'll have a great loaf! You're getting tips direct from a SF born and raised bread lover.. Enjoy! :)

I haven't tried this recipe yet, I just wanted to point out that sourdough starters made in different places have different levels of sour flavor - my starter will taste differently than one made in another state, for example. Therefore, unless you're IN San Fran, you're unlikely to make a sourdough that tastes like San Fran sour; this may explain why some folks think the recipe produces bread that is not sour enough.

Unfortunatly, my established starter was dumped down the drain by a well meaning daughter-in-law so this was made with a newly established starter. It only had a mild "tang" but I would suspect that was because of my immature starter. The texture of the bread was awesome. If you spray water on your oven walls a few times in the first few minutes of baking,the steam will encourage a thicker and crustier crust. It also helps to put a shallow pan containing water on the bottom rack and leave it during baking. This makes lovely loaves and can't wait to try it when I have a good strong starter. Thanks for the recipe, Donna!

I used the "Sourdough Starter" by Esther Nelson, from this website.  I replaced 1-1/4c of the bread flour with 1c of King Arthur Whole Wheat White Flour (for healthier bread), and 1/4c of vital wheat gluten (to help with rising).  I used butter rather than margarine.  And rather than an egg/water wash, I brushed butter on the loaves after they were done baking, and omitted the onion topping this time.  I formed this into two baguettes.  They had a distinct sourdough flavor, and a great texture with a good crusty crust and soft inside!  Thanks so much, Donna!

As usual, I'll share my KitchenAid Mixer version. My starter is 20 years old and came from King Arthur Flour. Several times it has been put to sleep by dehydrating and reawakened. The current one is only 4 weeks old. The day before I bakes I took 3/4 cup of starter from the fridge and added 3/4 cup warm water and 1 cup AP flour. Set it 6 feet from my wood stove and let it awake overnight. I now had a bubbly 2 cups of starter. Followed the directions to end of sentence in line one (except reserved the salt and used only 1 tbs sugar) and then into the mixer bowl with the dough hook. Added 1 cup flour at a time until I hit 4 cups of flour and then slow speed for 6 minutes. Turned the dough out onto my lightly floured bread board and l inverted the bowl over the top for 20 minutes. This 1st rest period is called the autolyse. Remove the bowl, flatten out the dough with your hands, and sprinkle about 1/2 the salt over it. Begin kneading the salt into the dough. After a few turns, sprinkle on the rest of the salt and continue to knead for 2 to 4 minutes, until the salt is completely incorporated and the dough is soft and smooth. When done with step 3...try this variation. Instead of chopped onion I VERY thinly slice an onion and sautee w/ butter and 1 tbs fresh thyme for 8 minutes. Even though it may look like lots use it all sprinkled over the top of the bread, then bake as timed. The tips may blacken but the taste is awesome. I do not do an egg wash with the thyme/onion mixture.

First, a reminder....sourdough sour taste depends on YOUR STARTER, not the bread recipe.  Mine is only  week old, still a baby.  Another reminder....you need to let your starter get to room temp and to PROOF before using.  I let mine sit proofing/fermenting for about 6-8 hours before using each time.  Then start the bread recipe As for the bread.........yum!  Followed the ingredients, except didn't have onions.  Egg and water go together to make a wash, don't add to recipe.   Used my stand mixer to stir and knead, made a round loaf and an oval loaf, slashed the top with a razor blade before the second rise, cornmeal sprinkled on parchment paper instead of oiled pan.   Also put a pie pan, half full of water, on the bottom rack of the oven during baking.  This should be put in during the preheat time to allow steam to build up.  Started checking for doneness at about 25 mins.  Loaf size can reduce/increase baking times   Straight to cooling racks when taken out to prevent sogginess.   Bread was wonderful!!  Great texture, great crust.  Can't wait to try it again as the starter matures.

Excellent sourdough bread. Makes wonderful croutons. Used the "Sourdough Starter II" recipe for starter.

This is by far the best sourdough bread I've made.
I place sesame seeds on top instead of chopped onion, it's great!

This didn't taste like sour dough bread but it DID taste like good white bread. I blame my starter for this b/c it was only 3 days old. I will try it again in a few weeks and report back.

I really don't know how to rate this bread.  I made it per the directions with the exception of using AP flour instead of bread flour and butter in the place of margarine.  I also used only an egg wash on top; no onions.  This bread turned out amazingly good.  I think that as a sourdough it probably flunks.  It wasn't very sour, which I attribute to using a relatively young starter.  Also, although the egg wash produced a lovely presentation the bread was in no way crusty like a true sourdough.  It had a nice chewy crust and a super tender crumb.  I made three small baguettes and baked them after the second rise. I formed the rest of the dough into 24 rolls, slashed the tops and froze on a baking sheet.  When they were solid I put them in a zipper bag.  I can take out any number I need, let them thaw and rise and bake.  I've now made wonderful fresh, hot rolls with a minimum of effort and just a little forethought.  What made these a real winner for me was that the rolls and bread were so good on the second day.  Lots of yeast bread recipes are good coming out of the oven but the real test is how good they are the next day.  These were just as good - still tender and delicious.  All in all a great recipe I plan to use often.

Since the 1st time I made this recipe, I've been getting requests from friends, family, and neighbors to make more.   Its gotten to the point that I'll have 3 different starters at all times in my kitchen.   I make about 8 loaves a week using this recipe.  So far, I've found that using an electric mixer when adding the milk/butter and then (seperately) again when adding the starter makes for a "spongier" and more well together bread.   When mixing in the additional flour, I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour for added flavor.   For the egg wash, I use both the yolk and whites from the egg and add a teaspoon of salt, then blend the egg/salt just until smooth.   Brush (do not use spoon) the wash onto the final bread.   

Using this wash technique has produced the best results so far and provides a nice crispy texture to the crust.  Spray down the sides of the oven with water just before baking to get a thicker crust.

I think I have made nearly every sourdough bread on this website.  THIS one is the winner, hands down.  I have made it over and over, and it always yields a perfect loaf of bread, crisp on the outside but light and fluffy inside.  If you have been searching for the perfect sourdough recipe, your search ends here!

This was a good bread but it didn't taste like sourdough bread and I used a great sourdough starter. If I was to rate this as a white bread then I would give it 5 stars.

For the folks who aren't getting "sour enough" bread... it is most likely your starter and not this recipe! Starters get more sour with age.  If you want to help this along, add 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water every other day to your starter for 7 days.  On the 8th day you will have enough starter to make a big batch of bread or you can give starters to friends.  This will help jump start the  "souring" of your starter. I used this recipe with my 100+ year old starter and it was great! Excellent sourness but not to the bitter point, great crust, and for a change I like to put kosher salt and rosemary on top instead  of onions.
Happy Baking Everyone

Love everything about this recipe, except for one thing:  I can't add nearly the amount of flour the recipe specifies!  Maybe it is a matter of how wet your sour dough starter is, but my dough is about right when I've added three cups of bread flour, rather than the 4-3/4 called for in the recipe.  I also add two tablespoons of vital wheat gluten, to make the dough rise better and be lighter in texture.  Of all the sourdough recipes I've tried, this is the one my family prefers!  I did a side-by-side taste test with three different recipes, and every member of my family liked this one best.  Great flavor, light texture, nice crust. . .

If you are an inexperienced baker, add the flour slowly.  If you are using a dough hook, watch for when the dough begins to form a ball around the hook, and cleans the sides of the bowl.  If you stop the mixer, it should relax into the bowl, but still hold a shape, rather than look like a stiff batter.  Softer doughs will give a more tender bread.

I think I have just found my signature sourdough bread--this recipe deserves every rave review it has received, and it gets mine also! I used a starter from King Arthur that I've been nurturing and I finally got that good sourdough tang with this loaf. Like Tunisianswife, I used honey to replace the sugar, and like LadyJayPee, I used butter instead of margarine. To reviewer CHRISTYDAWNE, I'm just learning the basics about starters, and I thought starter should take the place of yeast also; but from what I've read, it just takes a lot longer using starter only, and the yeast is supposed to help produce a lighter finished product. My thanks to Donna for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I take three days to make this bread.  The first day, I measure out my starter and add 3 TBLS flour, stir (leave it chunky!), and let rest until day two.  On day two, I mix up my dough, using water instead of milk, oil instead of butter, 1 full TBLS of salt instead of 2.5 tsp., and I add 1/4 C vital wheat gluten.  I use my KA mixer, add all the ingredients except the last 3-ish cups of the flour, and using the paddle beat the  out of the batter to get the gluten forming.  I add the rest of the flour, knead, put it in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight for a slow rise.  On day three, I remove from fridge, form my loaves, let rise, and bake.  If I'm feeling extra-adventurous, I form the loaves, cover, and refrigerate them overnight for another slow rise.  I don't use the onion or egg wash.

Delicious bread. I only used half of the ingredients and used my bread machine. The result is outstanding. My starter was too young (only 7 days) so I expect the sour taste will get better with time.

I have made biscuits using this recipe and baked them in a seasoned and greased cast iron pan. The crust on the bottom as well as the top have always been a delight. If steam is used you will not get that crust you are looking for (dry heat is better). Rather than round loaves, I make mine oblong. Also, that Sourdough Starter has to get to that essence of 'sourdough' fermentation to truly have the taste one is looking for and each climatical location will have it's own flavor. I have also made this receipe in a bread machine, following manufactures instructions layering each ingredient.

This recipe was a descent starting point. Following the recipe exactly was yummy, but with modifications, it can be even better!

If you want a bigger cell structure like what you find in SF or in other artisan breads, you want the dough to be kind of goopy so you can barely handle it. After the initial 1 cup, I put around 2 cups instead of the 3.75 is calls for. Don't punch it down! Handle gently to keep the air bubbles. In the morning I let it rise for the suggested hour so it is easier to handle, carefully form it into balls, and let it rise all day tented under a towel so it's ready for dinner. Huge air bubbles throughout, nice and soft, and ready so scoop and soak up my soup! Adding more flour, punching the dough down, and shorter rise time all lead to more dense bread. If that's what you like, disregard this comment.

Also, I started using this recipe when I began my starter three months ago. Even when the starter is young and doesn't have much of a funk, this recipe is still good as a not-very-sourdough bread (more like your basic white bread). This recipe is to give the right texture, and YOUR starter is what gives it the right flavor.

Once my starter had taken off, I cut out the dry yeast so it wouldn't compete (I think it's included as an insurance policy) and more than halved the sugar to give the bread more oomph. Don't completely cut it out because yeast needs a food source, but 3 Tb is a lot of sweet when you're trying to make sour. 1 Tb will suffice.

Great Sourdough bread! The key to making your bread taste sour and to have that great soft inside, is to let it rise for as long as possible. Try proofing your (tried and true) starter for a day or two and then put together your bread dough and let it sit over night. I like to knead it one more time in the morning and let rise for another few hours and bake the next afternoon. It takes a few steps, but well worth it! Wonderful recipe - Thank you so much!

This is a great sourdough bread recipe. I will now be the only one I will use. The thing I've found with other recipes is that they are usually good to use as a side with soup or stew, but really not the right texture for sandwiches. This makes great bread for either!!! The starter recipe I used was from this site by Esther and it was only 7 days old when I made my first batch of bread. I followed the instructions exactly in preparing the bread except I used dehydrated onion flakes on the top. I did make a few changes to the way I baked the bread. I put a pan of water on the rack under the bread and I put it in while I preheated the oven to let the oven get nice and steamy. I also scored the top of the bread right before I added the egg wash and onions. I then lightly misted the bread with water before I put it in the oven and then every 10 minutes while it was baking. The result was an amazingly crispy on the outside, soft and tangy on the inside loaf of wonderfulness!!! The first loaf lasted about 3 hours between 3 of us. I just can't say enough good things about this recipe!!

I had to use 2 cups of starter to get it to pull together, other than that it turned out great. I did omit the onion because true sourdough bread has none. The flavor was excellent. Those people who have said that it did not have a true sourdough flavor should blame their starter not the recipe. If you are working with a young starter, it is not going to have the deep sourdough flavor. My starter is over 25 years old so I found exactly what I was looking for with this recipe. Thanks for sharing, it is a great recipe.

Very good. I halved the recipe to make 1 loaf and followed the ingredients exactly.  I did use my bread machine on the dough cycle and then put into a loaf pan and set in oven with bowl of boiling water, for the second rise (for an hour).

When our local bakery closed leaving me with the only option of driving 45 minutes to get my Sourdough Bread fix, I started searching for recipes.  I came across this one and wanted to give it a try.  So after growing Sourdough Starter for a week I made this bread today... it was a HIT!   I had several friends try it and they all loved it.  Cudos to the author!

Ok so i made this twice. first time just the same as the recipe and it was great!
second time i decided to play a bit....added tsp. kosher salt.. tbs. garlic powder....1 cup shredded chedder cheese..and chopped pepperoni.
AWSOME!!!!! 
I also create a proof box in my oven by warming it on the lowest setting(170degees) then turn it off and add a sauce pot with boiling water. 
Let it get all steamy and add your dough. Remove pot before baking but the steam that's left will give your bread a super crust!!! Promise!

WOW! This is the best bread i've ever made, even with my starter only being 2 days old. I made 2 hugh round loves. My family was fighting over the last pieces. I didn't use the onions but I did spray a little water in the oven for a crispy crust. I also made an egg wash of 1 egg and 1 teaspoon salt to brush over the top. On one of my loves I slashed the top with a knife before I let it rise the second time and the other one I shashed after the second rise because I didn't know how to do it. The one I slashed before the second rise did better. the other one deflated a bit and didn't look as pretty, now I know.***update** I made this again and this time I kneeded in sundried tomatoes into half the bread and the other half I used garlic cloves cut into 1/4th and They were both so good we had them half gone while they were still warm!

I made this bread 2 days ago.  I followed the recipe to a T when it comes to contents, though I put the bread loaves into 2 bread tins simply because I like the shape.

Also, I always leave an extra hour when making bread as I like to have one extra rise, it makes the bread even, light and fluffy.  I also spray the oven walls right before and twice during baking with cool water underneath the wire rack.  It makes for a crispy crust.

These loaves came out wonderful, light, fluffy, and with just the right sourness to them. One thing I regret is having put onion on both as it would have been nice to use one as breakfast toast with preserves!

The bread came out great, made it in 2 loaf pans. I didn't use an eggwash, just brushed it with water when I put it in the oven and brushed it twice more while baking, which gave it a great crunchy crust. Also did not put onions on top.

I love this recipe. I have been using my  sourdough starter (amish friendship bread starter) for the past three years. It just gets better every time I make bread. I think the onions on top are very tasty addition.

GREAT recipe!  I liked it better than the recipe that brewed for 12+ hours! It was not necessarily a traditional sourdough, as it was quite soft and fluffy, but that is what I prefer. I also loved the amount of time it took compared to other recipes. I will definitely try this recipe again once my starter is more established and has more sourdough flavor :)

Excellent flavor even though I live in Florida!  Not exactly as sour as I would like and my starter is over a month old.  I really think SF has it's own water, air mixture that make their bread the best.  That being said, we absolutely loved this bread.  I did have to bake it about 10 extra minutes and I think it could have gone another 5 at least.  Anyway, I didn't use the onions on top but did slit the dough with a razor blade to get the great look of the bread.  Thank you so much Donna for a great recipe.

I couldn't wait for this to cool to try it, and I'm in bready goodness heaven!  I used the sourdough starter recipe on this site posted by Esther.  I know this will only get better as my starter ages.  This was not as chewy as what I got at Boudin in San Fran, more light like what they serve at Sear's (wonderful French toast!).  Even tho I knew better, I made the dough in the bread machine and it overflowed the pan a bit, so make sure you have a larger than 2 pound machine to do that with this one.  Made rounds and baked on a silpat sprinkled with cornmeal.  Update:  If you cut the recipe back to 18 servings, it fits perfectly in the 2 pound machine, and you can shape it into one really large round, or two smaller loafs to bake.

This was my first time ever baking bread. After lots of research I chose this recipe & the sourdough starter recipe from this site by Esther. My starter was 3 weeks old. I used my kitchenaid mixer so took a lot of tips from the breadguy's review. The bread came out FANTASTIC! If you're using a stand mixer then follow the tips from the breadguy's review. THANKS BREADGUY & DONNA! I'll make this again following the same directions except next time I'll use water instead of milk just to test out the differences. I also left off the onion. I'm not a big fan of onion on bread but it still came out great. My very picky husband & daughter loved it! Oh yes, it was sour. I'm excited to see what it will taste like as the starter ages more.

Dilemma…should I rate this 1 because it does not resemble San Francisco Sourdough at all and I was disappointed, or 5 because it is a nice, very soft and tenderly chewy bread that resembles a very sour buttermilk loaf? All the pictures attached to this recipe verify that the results are uniformly fine grained and smooth, the opposite of SF Sourdough, which has a substantial chewiness, course uneven holes and a very crisp crust. I made this exactly per directions using my 30-year old starter, making it into 2 loaves to take to a birthday/St. Patty’s Day party as a spinach dip bowl with the second loaf cut up for dippers.  After the dip and dippers were gone, people hovered around like vultures to grab the remains while I cut up the actual bowl.  People loved the bread for itself, making comments that it wasn’t like a typical crunchy sourdough. (This is CA and we get SF Sourdough straight from 1st prize winning SF’s LaBrea Bakery.) So, they liked it. I might make it again and rename it “Soft Sourdough Sandwich Loaf” with some slight changes for my own file. So, a compromise between good taste and failed expectations…I give it a 3.

I made this recipe a couple of times and the second time I used one cup of 50/50 wheat flour and put kosher salt on the top after the egg wash.  It was spectacular!  Thanks for the recipe.

I have a very established starter and I added some citric acid (1/8 tsp per cup of flour) to give it a more sour taste. I didn't use as much flour but this is dependent on a lot of factors. You just have to add water until you have the right consistency. This recipe was absolutely wonderful!!! I loved it!

this was my first attempt at sourdough, very good.  Nice buttery flavor with just the right sourness and hint of sweetness (which I love).  Nice chewy crust as well.

This bread turned out perfect. I followed the instructions exactly.  I am a beginner bread maker. Oh my godness, it turned out perfect! I used the King Arthur sourdough starter, but have fed it with 1 cup milk, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 cup bread flour (instead of the instructions it came with). Even my sister was impressed who is an excellent cook and baker! Thank you Donna!

A great recipe, but not for sourdough! It was amazing bread:  Very sweet and tasty, but not sour at all (and my starter was well matured and a great in other recipes)!

Used warm water instead of milk, butter instead of margarine, no onions, only egg white with no water for the wash. I sprinkled sea salt onto the wash before placing in the oven. I took the loaf out twice during baking to add more egg wash and spritz the oven with water. Got a really beautiful crust that did not get at all soggy overnight or the following day (laid loaf cut side down on a cutting board, unwrapped). The loaf didn't last longer than that though since it was all eaten! My starter is a couple weeks old but it still had a great flavor. I'm excited to repeat this recipe. 
** Edit: the first time I made this recipe I halved it and mixed then kneaded in my standard sized Kitchenaid stand mixer; made one loaf. The second time, I made this with the exact servings for two loaves. There was too much content to appropriately and easily mix and knead in my Kitchenaid. I also made three loaves out of it instead of two. Otherwise it makes a very large artisan loaf.  
** Edit 2: I made this dough into rolls and it came out beautifully. 1/2 of the recipe made 8 large rolls. I probably should've tried for 10 smaller rolls instead! I baked them in a greased round cast iron 10-12 minutes @ 400 degrees, no wash. They were wonderful and soft yet slightly browned on the outside.

I've made it a few times a few different ways.  I had the best results when using the suggestions of other posters: omit yeast, increase starter to 2c, use water not milk, use just the egg white & skip the onion.  I like to let it rise all day & punch it down a couple times to build flavor but it also turns out good when you hurry the rise in a warm oven.  The sourness depends on your starter but is definitely stronger the next day.  It will also be stronger if you don't use freshly fed starter.

Just made this (using a two-year old Sourdough Starter II from this site), and my fiance wanted to propose to me again (as he solo-finished the first loaf). Would give it 5 stars, except I did tweak it a tiny bit: used half whole wheat flour and butter  and skipped the egg wash and onions. That said, it was an absolutely perfect yeast bread-baking day (hot and humid), and our starter is probably really interesting because we live in a 100 year old house AND we brew beer.

Good bread!  I used a new starter (6 days old) so the flavour was not super sour-doughy but still very good.  I made one with onions and one without and the one with onions was much more flavourful.  Will update if changes with an older or better starter.  Thankds for the recipe.

Regarding a previous comment that your location creates different sour flavors doesn't apply. Starters are usually kept in the refridgerator, not at room temperature. Like others comments, this is a good starter for white bread, but this is not true sour dough.

Finally, a fluffy sour dough bread that is crisp on the outside!! I think my starter needs to get a little more established, but this is the fluffiest bread I've ever made. Through all the research I've done and the little practice I've had, I've learned that making the full amount of the recipe makes a huge difference. Trying to cut it in half did not work as well. The yeast needs to dissolve in warm water, but since this recipe doesn't include water, I just put it in a 1/4 cup of the warmed (100-110 degree) milk and added the rest after letting it dissolve for about ten minutes. And by spraying the oven with a spray bottle a few times while cooking and/or leaving a shallow pan with hot water on it, the steam helps the outside become crispy. I did use butter instead of egg on the outside, and omitted the onions on top. Very good!! And happy to finally not have one issue with the outcome of my bread!!

Very good. Light and delicious. I added onions and garlic to the dough as well as on top of it. Made two loaves, gave one to friends and kept one for my husband and myself. Will definitely make this one again!

This makes an incredible loaf of bread! The color,
texture and aroma is amazing. I followed the recipe
to a tee, except I omitted the onions and egg wash,
and used the sourdough starter recipe from the
"King Arthur Flour" web site. Put everything in my
KitchenAid, then let it knead for 5 minutes. I make
bread a least once a week, and I've never seen a
bread rise like this recipe does. This has become
my favorite bread recipe. Baked it in my covered
stone bread baker, then served it with a Minestrone
soup. 5 stars and highly recommended!

I also used the same starter recipe, Sourdough II, which was about a week old.  I omitted the onions but followed the rest of the recipe.  Amazing!  It was so delicious!  I made one load and other half in rolls.  I ate three rolls right out of the oven and had a breakfast sandwich in the morning.  Wonderful flavor and texture!

Since I made this on a rainy day, I allowed for two rises before forming it into loaves.  It turned out very good, but not very "sour" tasting, like other reviewers stated.  Like other reviewers, my starter is new, so I'm hoping with age the flavor will come out.  I braided one loaf and the other just left on a baking sheet in the shape of a loaf.  The braided one turned out very pretty and golden with the egg wash.  One question - I thought the purpose of a starter was to not have to use yeast.  Is this not the case?  Anyway, this was a very good recipe and made the house smell wonderful on a gloomy day.  I look forward to trying it again with a more mature starter.

this is a great bread. I disagree with other reviewers who said it did not have much of a sourdough taste. Remember your bread is only as good as your starter. I will make this many more times. It makes great toast and great for sandwiches as well. Oh I made it in two loaf pans.

I live in the Bay area and this did not come out tasting like sourdough bread. This was a great white bread, but I was disappointed because I fed my starter over the course of two months just for this recipe. I ended up turning these into soup bowls by hollowing out the rounds and coating the inside with provolone cheese before adding the soup. I then heated the rounds in the oven for a few minutes and they came out great.

After 4 days of feeding and taking care of my starter I made my first loaves (rounds) of bread. Without a doubt some of the best bread I have ever made! One round was eaten up in minutes and only me standing guard prevented the other loaf from being eaten up! I think I will be making this bread VERY often. Thank You. If we could we would give it 5++++ stars!

This was good but it tasted more like regular white bread.  I made the starter 4 days ago and thought it'd be ready but it wasn't very sour.   Any ideas on how to get it more sour?

OMG, I made bread!  This was my first attempt and after reading all the different things to adjust, I admit I was somewhat terrified.  However... I used the sourdough starter video as my jumping off place (I let it ferment on the counter for about 5 days without feeding it) and then used this recipe.  After sifting through the suggestions these are the ones I took:   I used warm water instead of milk, only used two cups of flour before turning it out to knead (which probably added another cup during the 9 minutes of kneading I did).  I think the egg wash (egg white + water) should either be left off or used on the entire loaf because it looked a little silly by only putting a little on the top.    Next time I will add a little water in a pie pan to the oven because I think I like the idea of "steam" in the oven while cooking (I simply forgot to do it).  I used my silicone baking pads instead of oiling the baking sheets and then put the loaves directly on a cooling rack straight from the oven.  The consistency is more like good white bread, but it definitely has that "sour" taste I was going for.  I ended up with two regular sized round loaves.  Yum!

This is absolutely delicious! I have a 200 year old sourdough starter which may have added to the taste but this recipe is great. I did make 2 small changes. I did 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c water and I also added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt to make it a total of 3 tsps. Other than that kept everything the same. Mmmm!

I have never baked bread before this.  It was my first time and it has turned out great every time I make it!  I didn't use any egg or onion.  I wanted a more plain bread and I love it. I even forgot the sugar once and it was still very tasty.

This does make a really good sourdough bread. The ratio of dry/wet ingredients may need adjusting as I ended up with what looked like biscuit dough at first until I added some warm water to it to make it a bit stickier. If you're not from the West coast you will not get that trademark San Fran flavor but you can make a really tangy sour bread by cultivating your own yeast in a sourdough starter. Do not add dry yeast to a sourdough starter recipe and let it gather it's own wild yeast naturally and it will get sour and tangier much faster.

Deelicious! I used this recipe because it calls for so much starter and I didn't want to have to throw any away. The flavor was just a little sour, more yeasty, but it was nice having a fast, enriched sourdough bread for a change. Didn't do the onion part. I baked my loaves in a preheated dutch oven, smeared with lots of butter. Next time I'll use loaf pans because this bread makes such wonderful toasted sandwiches.

Delicious!  I don't know if "San Francisco" has a different taste than anyother bread; but this one was a delicious sourdough bread, even without the chopped onions.  I used my own starter that I prepared for 5 days prior to making the loaves.

I used my bread machine to mix and knead this dough and it came out wonderful! It was enough to make one loaf and four smallish bread-bowl sized loaves.  I did not use the egg wash or the onion, but I did put a ramekin of water in the oven with the bread.  This is a keeper!

I made this with my 5-day old starter and they are fabulous!   I halved the recipe and made rolls with it, baking them in a muffin tin.  The rolls are a great alternative, with less baking time and more of the yummy crust:bread ratio.   Recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made this bread today using the sourdough starter from Esther. 
It was awesome!! The rising took more than an hour but who cares!
The bread was restaurant quality if not better than the restaurant. 
Instructions were easy. A beginner could make this and have great
Results. Thank you for posting!! I am looking forwards to taking it 
To the church potlucks. :)

I found this recipe to be very tasty.  It had a good texture.  I was worried about trying to make it here in Georgia because the atmosphere (humidity and the like) is so different from San Fran.  But it was really, really good.  I'll definitely make it again!

Awesome bread!  I omitted the onions on top though and they turned out not only delicious but also beautiful!  I will be making this in mini versions during the winter months to make mini chili bowls!  I will be using this recipe over and over!

Excellent flavour if you are using a really good starter (thank you Redneck Gramma xox), but like other reviewers said, it does give a light, fluffy texture and not the dense, chewy texture one expects from a sourdough bread.  I will keep experimenting with this one while looking for a 'true' Sourdough that has the chewy texture they are so well known for.....

This recipie is one of the best I have used for sour dough. I was a little weary about the onions but now....... I love it. As long as you have a good starter, this recipie is great.

Fantastic!  I found I actually like it more using half bread flour and half AP flour.  We don't use the onions on top, but that's personal preference.  Everyone who has tasted this bread loves it!

Best sourdough I have ever tried. I just use dried milk powder as a substitute and it works out great!

I must say I was excited to try this recipe and am very disappointed!  I make bread every other day for my family, and the DH has been bugging me to make a sourdough.  I chose this one from the rating.  I have always proofed my yeast but chose to forgo it and followed this recipes instructions.  I was left with a dough that had little lumps of undissolved yeast and I believe the only reason it rose was because of my starter.  I will try this recipe again, but will use my way and proof the yeast first.

I have made this a couple times now! This morning my husband, Who spent MANY years in Germany and LOVES his German style breads, told me this is the best bread he has eaten since he returned home from Germany many years ago! He is already asking me to start more! I made 1 loaf w/onions and 1 w/out and  we love them both. Going to add MORE onions next time!  Some people might say it is not "TRUE San Fracisco sourdough", Oh Well!!! It is still AMAZING!  Thank you for sharing it with us!

The first bread I have ever made but do I love it!! Only issue I had was I tried to cut it straight out of the oven and ended up with very dense slices of bread. Need to make sure they cool prior to cutting.

I have been searching for a great sourdough recipe and finally found it! I made it in my mixer, adding ingredients as listed, then let it mix/knead for a few minutes. I made one loaf with the onions, and one without; both were great. I will be making this bread at least once a week, thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe!  I goofed up on it by not THOROUGHLY reading the directions first, and it STILL came out wonderfully!  For those of you who are unhappy with the end result not being "sour" enough, it's because your starter doesn't have the acidity it takes to make true sourdough bread.  I have two starters: One with flour and water only and the other with flour, water and yeast.  The one that was started from flour and water is the most sour.  If yours is started with a commercial yeast, your bread is going to taste exactly like the yeast you put in it.  The flour/water starter is a bit more high maintenance, but well worth the effort and time you put into it.  I would give this ten stars if only it were possible!

This bread came out great and was so easy.  I put the two loaves into two stone bread pans that I have. I tried a whole wheat version last week and it was great as well.  I used a cup of white flour and 3 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour.

This took twice as long to raise as the recipe said it would (maybe my house is too cold?).. The loaf came out beautiful but we hardly tasted the sourdough flavor at all.

The bread tastes great, but the sourdough taste is too mild for me.  Maybe it's my starter, which is only a few weeks old... I'll try a different sourdough because I like it stronger, but this is a really yummy bread.

I mistakenly used 1c warm water instead of milk, but it still turned out wonderful!  Didn't realize the mistake until I read the recipe well after it was eaten up.

I made this for the first time today.  I have never made sourdough bread before.  I think for my first try it came out wonderful.  I let my starter ferment for 5 days.  It smelled wonderful like beer.  I kept 1 cup of the started and will add to it daily for 4 more days and then store in the fridge.  I highly reccomend this recipie.

Mmmmm!!!  This just gets better every time I make it, as my starter gets older.  I made it into rolls last time, split them, and put barbecued shredded beef on them and they were to die for.  I have used all purpose four, because that's what I had on hand, and they still came out great.  Next I will try with the bread four, as the recipe calls for. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I've made this recipe several times, and it is very adaptable.  I've used honey in place of sugar, made it with sugar, bake it with a pan of water in the oven and without.  Doesn't matter - it turns out perfectly EVERY time.

I made this into rolls with a young starter and it was quite good.  Can't wait to try again in a few weeks!  

If anything, this is a great white bread recipe - great bakery texture.

The only thing I did differently was add 1T of vital wheat gluten for every cup of flour.  This was my first time adding gluten, and it made breadmaking easier for me.  I'll be adding it when making bread from now on.

I have to say I was a little dissapointed with this bread. I am from San Francisco, but am living in Holland so I was really craving some sourdough. I followed the recipe exactly, including the onions, but my loaves turned out with no real sourdough taste. I also had to take the loaves out a full 10 minutes early or they would have been completely overcooked. I think I will try a different sourdough recipe next time.

This is a tangy white bread. It's a very good tangy white bread that raises beautifully. I just picked up fresh starter from Acme (the Boudin rival in San Francisco) and made this recipe... in San Francisco... I used the best possible starter, straight from an amazing SF bakery and it's still flat white bread. It's essentially a white bread roll recipe with some starter thrown in. If you're looking for an excellent, true sourdough, look for a recipe that does not call for yeast. It will take 15 hours of rise time and to it right and you'll be incredibly glad you did!

I made the recipe today and it was ok, but not like the true SF sourdough bread I've come to know.  I think the butter and milk made it too soft and more like a nice crusty sandwich bread.  The flavor was good but the crumb was more dense than other SF sourdough recipes i've made.

This recipe was wonderful, I have been trying several recipes, but this is the only one to give me the texture and crust I have been wanting.  Only negative is the recipe reads as though it is a double but it did not work to make 2 loaves.

Like everybody says, this is a great recipe.I like the crunch I get from a 425 oven so I used water not milk and added 2 tbl whole milk powder to the flour. I also used Saf instant yeast,2 tsp,and a hot Dutch oven.
I have severe tendonitis so kneading dough is out of the question. I'd like to pass along to others that may have hand/wrist problems that you can make this bread to perfection without kneading. I also increased the water by 1/2 a cup for this method.
Use a stand mixer w/paddle and pour all the wets in there and mix around. Then (honestly) dump 1/2 your dry on top, mix a couple seconds, change to the hook and dump the rest of the dry in there and mix for about 60 seconds. Until combined.
Then let that sit for 20 minutes covered.No punching down
I knead with the hook. Here & there stop and pull the dough down from the top of the hook, at times I kept the bowl at half mast while running, but the total machine time was about 5 min.
Rest in the bowl again 20 min,then knead with hook again for a few more min then take out the dough and just gently stretch (on floured counter) with your fingertips making a thick disk, then hold it up letting the weight do the stretching for you. Grab fat parts, hang, grab,turn..plop on counter fold stretching edges to middle to make a ball then rest 20 min 
Then do it all again twice & follow recipe here out. Sounds like a lot but when you can't knead...This only adds 20 min to the recipe. No egg wash 'cause of the temp but here it is.

While I doubt my bread tastes the same, I really enjoyed making it. I used the leftovers of the beginnings of a sourdough starter I made. Really glad for the extra yeast here, as it cut the time it took to make this bread in half. The taste is phenomenal. I just made one giant loaf and it came out looking like something from a professional bakery! Will definitely be making this recipe again.

Never baked sourdough bread before, looks like first attempt is complete bust. Reviewed ingredients & amounts, fairly certain I got those right. In mixing ingredients was using a small whisk, but the dough kept building up on whisk. Could not find anything more appropriate so I went to my 2 hands. Recipe calls for 1 cup flour  initially, 3 3/4 cups later. Once I got to 4 cups, the mixture was too dry, wasn't binding to a loaf, so I stopped. Thought about a mixer(too late), but we gave away our big Kitchen Aid and didn't know if our current mixer is big enough. Any ideas? I know, go to the bakery & buy a loaf of sourdough.

I wanted baguettes to serve with beef stew and found this recipe.  It was great!  I did use water instead of milk as suggested.  Half a batch made two baguettes.  We had the second one the next day with Swiss fondue.  It was maybe even better then!

Mine took more like an hour and a half to double in size, but it did eventually; I'm not sure if this is because my starter isn't as active as it should be? I made these last night just before bed, so I let them cool overnight and decided to try a "small sample" this morning: I ended up eating the whole loaf for breakfast! Delicious and really fun to make.

Tried cooking for the first time for my Food Microbiology class. Turned out way better than hoped. I do want to point out that all sourdough could be nicknamed San Francisco sourdough because the bacteria that gives its distinctive taste is called Lactobacillus Sanfranciscensis.

I first have to say, this was my first attempt making a sourdough bread. This was also my first time using a starter. This was my first time attempting to grow a starter which I've been doing for the past week. I read ALL the reviews and I decided to follow some of the modifications of leaving out the milk, yeast, and onions. I think the onions would be lovely, but I wanted to go real basic this time. I also used my bread machine to do the dough prep as I don't have a stand mixer. :(  I put it together, got it mixed up and balled up in the bread machine and left it for several hours. When I came back I was disappointed it didn't appear to rise. I 'punched' it down, although it was already down pretty much and put it on a baking pan to rise in the oven w/ the light on. Nothing really happened. I was going to toss it, but then I thought to go ahead and bake it and see at least the flavor. The bread rose quite well once it was in the oven although it was a rather weird shape. The flavor was wonderful!!! The open cell structure is fantastic and even though mine was a little denser than I suspect it will be in the future...it really came out w/a GREAT taste. Thank you so much!

This is a great recipe although I am not an authority on SF Sourdough bread. The texture is great and the flavor is nice but I think I might put only one tbsp of sugar next time because I like a more sour taste. My starter is 2 months old and works well so I decreased the yeast to one scant teaspoon but increased my starter to 2 cups.(Just increased the rising times) I have never made sourdough with milk but it makes a nice soft fluffy bread. I made 2 baguettes and one round with onion topping, sauteed first as another reviewer suggested and it is amazing!! Also I slashed the tops first before the final rising instead of just before baking and I am very pleased with the results. The round usually sinks a bit after slashing and often results in a much flatter bread no matter how careful I am. Slashing before the final rise gave me a beautiful high loaf! I will definitely use this as one of my regular recipes thank you.

First of all, I have a well established starter to work with, so that helps.  This recipe is awesome!  I don't put onions on top, but other wise, I follow it exactly with perfect results every time.

This is our go to #1 will not fail bread--Herman is maturing and keeps getting better. Made 2 loaves for our family & friends Easter dinner gathering. Lots of compliments, request for the recipe, and a nice tally of people getting up for seconds and thirds of just bread which does not need butter.Will submit a photo later

This time I made the recipe with 1/2 cup quick oats 1/4 cup wheat flour 4 cups bread flour. No egg wash because I think it darkened the bread too much. Backed for 25 minutes PERFECT!!

This is a great recipe!  I'm new to sourdoughs, but it came out wonderful.  Used half to make sourdough bread bowls with my crab bisque. Hubby thought it was so good, he asked me to make more bowls for the leftover bisque!  This is definitely a keeper!

This was just ok. I left my starter out for almost 2 weeks, feeding it, etc., etc. (Used the "Sourdough Starter" recipe from this site). After 8 days, I tried to make it without adding the additional yeast per the reviewer who claims to be a san francisco sourdough guru. I didn't just have to leave it for 2-3 hours, it was actually 2 days later that it still hadn't risen to double. Had to throw the batch out. The second time around I added the yeast per the recipe (proofed it first) and still found it took over 1.5 hours to double the first time. One hour for the second rise. Cooked it 40 minutes and the crust was still soft and the insides somewhat spongy. This bread just wasn't sour enough to be a good sourdough and too sour to be a good white. The outcome just was't nearly worth the effort. Sorry! I love the Mama D's Italian bread recipe from this site and make it twice a week. I think I will stick with that from now on and just buy my sourdough at the bakery.

It's not the best bread I have ever had in my entire life, but it was still really good. My starter is only 10 days or so old, so it's not particularly sour, but it smells to high heaven before being used and it's made three loaves in the bread machine with a distinct sour taste.

This wasn't so much sour, but it was really tasty fresh from the oven with a thin layer of butter. I made two loaves in loaf pans instead of rounds on a baking sheet, one without onions on top and the other with, and it worked out well. The crust is thick and crunchy, and smells like pretzels. I will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful delicious bread. It had a light tang to it due to the sourdough starter. However, it did not have the density that I would expect from a San Francisco Sourdough. Instead, it was light and the mouth feel was more like the French bread that they bake in the grocery stores (though the taste of this was much better).

My husband loved the taste and texture of this bread, and I do, too, it's just not a true sourdough to me. I baked two loaves specifically for use in grilled cheese sandwiches. Again, my husband thought the texture was great, but I didn't think it held up well to hardier ingredients (there's  no way, for instance, that this would work for a sourdough burger).

Although I'm only giving it 4 stars, I will make this bread again. It's a good every day bread, especially for kids (my daughter doesn't like crust but was willing to eat it on this bread). I missed the chewiness of a true sourdough, though.

I just remove my sourdough from the oven and they look beautiful and my husband just cut one of those and said that this is great, the taste of sour is not strong even if I let my starter for 2 weeks.  The texture and flavor still great.

I just moved to San Francisco Bay area so I thought this would be sort of a Christening for me. I too used slightly deviated  ingredients to my liking, but my dough didn't rise as well even though I did use a 2 day old starter, maybe that wasn't long enough

OK as a white bread.  Small holes.  To develop more sour flavor, time is needed for the lactobacillus bacteria in the starter to produce more lactic acid.  Though the strain does vary regionally, time can produce more sour flavor.  Given enough time, you won't need to even add additional "booster" yeast as the yeast in your starter would have enough time to produce the rise.  Another recipe calls for an intermediate between starter and dough that sits for nearly 2 days (part at RT, mostly in fridge), then making the dough which again sits overnight in the fridge before baking.  Very sour and delicious!

This bread was okay - I especially liked the added onions on top. It allows me, as well, to expand upon what I can do. I cooked the entire batch of bread in my cloche oven (ceramic oven) for 20 minutes with the cover on and 20 minutes with it off. Basically, until it turns brown. It made perfect bread that was as light as a feather. However next time I think I will separate this into two loaves for a more "artisan" effect. I rate this 4 stars because it was good, but to me it wasn't "the most awesome thing since sliced bread."

This was my very FIRST home made bread and it was awesome! I had an amateur starter so the "sour" taste was absent (quick and easy starter from this site). However, the bread was moist with a slight crisp on the outside. After it cooled from the oven, I tightly wrapped in foil and used the next day for French toast. Topped with caramelized bananas and walnuts, this breakfast was fit for a queen. I'm hooked on fresh bread now!

I have never tasted San Francisco bread so can't compare, just chose this recipe as I had an immature starter and wanted to do something with the waste - It turned out gorgeous, absolutely perfect!
I used the egg wash and red onion on the crust

Having grown up there, I love San Francisco Sourdough.  I've tried every starter there is, and so far yours is the best.  It has been suggested to me that in order to produce the flavor of real San Francisco sourdough, I cannot use just any old yeast, I must use the yeasts that are grown native to the SF Bay Area.  I will order some SF yeast ($6.95/oz online--OUCH!), and hope that my starter never sours and needs replacement.

Great recipe! I didn't make some changes - I didn't use dry yeast, just my starter which increased rising time. I used water instead of milk, and didn't add the onions or do the egg wash. The bread was very tasty with a nice texture :)

Of course after I had this all mixed and rising I read all of the reviews.  6 cups of flour was entirely too much for my kind of starter.  My starter is much more thick than the author's, and thus created a less liquid mix to begin adding flour.  I will in the future only use 5 cups.  Having said that, even after 45 minutes in the oven, the bread did not brown quickly, and though it did rise well for both risings, both loaves weighed a ton.  The results were that my husband proclaimed it to be the best crust he'd ever eaten.  So we traded, I gave him the crust and he gave me the unfortunately mushy center.  The crust was, indeed good, very sweet and so close to the flavor I was looking for, but the center was very heavy and dense.  So, as you are making this, consider the type of starter you have and adjust your flour accordingly.  I will try again...this is a learning process and if at first you don't succeed, try again.  Right?

My new go-to bread recipe!  I ran out of White Bread Flour, so I substituted the last cup of flour with Whole Wheat Bread Flour.  It turned out wonderful, so I did it again the second time I made the bread.  It turned out perfectly!

I liked this originally, The second time I made it I did not add the butter and got a much better crust.  I can take or leave the onions, does not really add much to the sourdough.  I use this with a whole wheat starter then white flour for the remaining, two teaspoons of malted barley really increases the lift a lot.

We made this using whole wheat starter and substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup white flour.  Absolutely delicious!  Light color and texture was perfect.

Cue the angelic music...This is my first really successful loaf of bread!  Very nice.  The crust wasn't as crusty as I would have hoped for SF sourdough even though I had a pan of steaming water and did a little spritzing of water as well, though that could be my fault due to inexperience.  If you're really looking for that San Francisco sourdough flavor, definitely make the effort to get the real deal starter. It's a unique flavor that just can't be duplicated because of the special growies that only exist in the SF Bay.  Straight up generic sourdough is tasty, too.  It's just not SF tasty if that's the flavor you're aiming for.

I have made this bread twice now, and its wonderful. It always rises really well, and is never dense. I skip the egg wash and onions, and just rub butter on the top of the loaf when it comes out of the oven. Great recipe.

Yum.  Let your proof work a bit to get sour or add citric acid.  I left the onions off - no need on a good bread.  Egg wash is for presentation only.  It adds a nice shine.  Make sour dough many times until you get it right ~ it's worth it for a lifetime of good bread :-)

I love this recipe, use it for pizza crust, for calazones, and it is amazing with soup! This was the first sourdough recipe I tried, and I've stuck with it ever since, made it many times. It's great.

This is an excellent and very easy to make recipe. I use my bread machine to make the dough and then make whatever shaped rolls, loaves etc. and bake in the oven ****The longer the starter sits at room temp the more tart the result will be!!!****

I made this recipe using my handy dandy bread machine.  I used the dough cycle.  When the dough was completed I divided it into 3 balls then rolled them out and rolled them into baquettes.  I allowed them to rise for 1 hour 15 minutes then baked them for 20 minutes.  I got 3 beautiful baquettes.  Great recipe!

I made this dough in my Zo bread machine with an 8 day old starter (fed daily), added the egg with the other ingredients by mistake and it still came out great.   This recipe made 4-12 in. Subway type loaves with lots of tang.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.  I can't wait to make it again, without the egg.  Definitely add water to a hot pan in the bottom of your oven for steam.

I had no issues while preparing, baking or eating this bread.  It actually makes a really nice, tasty loaf of bread.  But the issues that I have with this are based on the fact this really doesn't seem like the sourdough I know.  No long fermentation times and the addition of a considerable amount of commercial yeast, I think, relegate this recipe to the realm of "semi-sourdough" bread.    Don't get me worng; This recipe make a very tasty and attractive loaf!  Is it ever going to produce something really close to tradition SF SD bread?  Probably not.  Would I make it again?  Certainly.     -->Baking Notes:  2 Loaves in my 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 bread pans were a bit small.  I split them 60/40 and the larger loaf looked great, but the smaller one looked a quite puny.  I omitted the onion topping, replaced 200g (of 650g) of flour with WW, used olive oil as the fat and added a few tablespoons of cornmeal to the flour.  My starter is wild and at least 3 months old.  It has a wonderful smell!!  not joking! ----------------------- 3 Stars for Good, Not-Very-Sourdough Bread...  ;)

This is THE best recipe for real sourdough bread! Of course the most important ingredient in sourdough bread is your sourdough starter, so make sure you use a good one! It's what gives sourdough it's flavor, so the older and more developed the starter it, the better flavor you will have.

This is a great recipe. My husband loves Sourdough Bread. I had been looking for just the right recipe for a while. I love the crispy crust. I took the advise and sprayed the walls of my oven with water, the second batch, this turned out much better. I have also tried this recipe without the onions and it is still great!

It was a great bread but did not seem very "sourdoughy" I don't know whether to blame the bread or the starter which I got off this site and made up two days ago like it said. I used the "Sourdough Starter II" off this site. It did make two large loaves. Mine fell some because I let them rise too long. Less then an hour for the second rise would have been good unlike the full hour like I did.

It was great. Not as sour as I would have liked, but that was because my starter was only four days old. I will try it again next week when my starter has aged another week. But the flavor was great and it was easy to make by hand. I omitted the onions though, I just wanted plain old sourdough.

My first loaf of sourdough! My starter is almost 2 weeks old and I had no problems with it rising! It was the size of a football when it was finally finished... however, sour taste was minimal. It was a fantastic loaf of white though. I think the older the starter gets the more flavor it'll have. Either way, delish and worth the time and effort. I baked it on my pizza stone (sprinkled with cornmeal (which gave it a nice crispy bottom)

My starter is only 8 days old so we didn't get really tangy sourdough but this bread turned out perfectly.  The texture and crust and taste were all wonderful.  The only change I made was to use a little gluten flour.

Fine crumb like wonder bread, but stores very well; remains moist till the end.  I've made this many times and recipes works great every time.  Good recipe for beginner, very forgiving.

Wow, wow, wow!  This bread was fabulous.  I am not a bread baker, in fact this was my first! My brother started a sourdough starter when he was visiting for Thanksgiving and never got around to making the bread.  He passed it along to me when he returned home with no directions.  I chose this one and I got lucky! It's not too sour, though I guess if I leave it do it's thing longer it could be.  I am told the older the starter the better it gets.  The starter was the same as the 2 Sourdough Starters found here.  Try it you'll love it!

I used this recipe to make two round loaves of bread.  They looked beautiful, and tasted good.  But the texture was not what I was hoping to achieve. Inside the crust, the bread is soft and fluffy more like Wonderbread sandwich loaf than San Francisco Sourdough(as other reviewers have mentioned).  I believe it's due to the addition of milk. It's a fine recipe.  I just think it could be given a more fitting name.

Easy to make. The starter really makes a difference. My starter was actually too strong. I made rolls and would recomend a lower cooking time.

This recipe was good, but not what I expected. I proofed it twice and it got really fluffy, so it reminded me more of a great sandwhich bread. I have a 6 year old starter, that I grew from a professional baker, so the flavor I got was sourdough. My only issue was the texture. I think it would be better if it was kneaded longer.

with a good starter, this bread was perfect!  i followed this recipe almost exactly [excluded the onions on top because my husband and i aren't too fond of them].  used these for breadbowls for mulligatawny soup and we were getting so full, but couldn't stop eating!  in future i'll make 4 smaller loaves out of this, which would be a more reasonable breadbowl for us.  thanks for this recipe, it will become a staple.

this is a nice soft supple dough to work with.  Since I used a honey starter, I didn't use all the sugar and subbed honey for the sugar(honey pulls moisture out of the air and will keep bread softer longer).  The bread is feathery soft with a slight tang.  Put a dry hot pan in the oven while preheating and added water to pan when I put the bread in to bake; creating a mist to produce a nice crust.  Topped with flax,sesame, and poppyseeds instead of onions.  Thanks for this nice recipe.

This isn't sour enough for me.  You will want to add more starter or vinegar to get a real sour taste.

I have to tell you that this was the best bread that I have ever made.  My starter was only five days old but the bread had a wonderful flavor to it.  I took it to a potluck at Bible study and both loaves disappeared.  I made round loaves.  Next time I'm going to try regular loaves.  I used my kitchenaide mixer and let it do all of the kneading.  I can't wait to see what the flavor will be like when my starter ages.

Wonderful bread. I make approx. 30 loafs of bread a week for local farmers markets all summer. I make this in to large buns for sandwiches. Vidalia sweet onions are the best on these. I've also done them plain for my sons who don't like onions. They love the buns. They are great to make your own cold meat sandwich on!

This recipe will make wonderful bread just as written, but I always omit the onions just to make it more versatile bread.

 Many people for many decades have insisted that the bacteria and yeast airborne in the San Francisco region are different enough to create a very unique bread. From research we now know that this is not the case.  Many regions on the planet have almost an identical makeup of yeasts and acetobacter and lactobacilli. Most regions have a very similar make up of the same components. 

 The difference it seems between breads is in the creation and care of the sourdough starter. I cannot tell you which ingredients or habits will make the best starter but I will say that if you can create a starter that looks and smells pleasing to you, then you will also create a bread that you find delicious.

Instead of making two large loaves, make them into smaller rolls for family dinners. They work great.

I love this recipe,  however I use it as a basic blueprint. I only use 1 T sugar, I use a minimum of two cups of Herman starter,  knead cooked wheat berries,  raw flax, sunflower, and sesame seed. I don't add water to the eggwash. But I replace half of the milk with water.  I think this recipe is good  in original form, but I love the texture of nuts/seeds.  I also sprinkle the very top with all that is inside except wheat berries after putting egg whites.

While my end product doesn't remind San Francisco sour dough bread at all, it's an amazing bread and definitely a keeper. My picky fried told me that it's the best white bread she ever tasted. It reminds me of Russian bulka.

Turned out great although I won't do the onions next time. I let's the starter sit for a good 2 days. I'm sure the next patch will be better.

I have made this 4 times using a friends starter I have managed to keep alive.  It makes very good bread.  It is soft but not overly airy.  The crust is very nice and not too stiff.  Did not use the onions. It makes excellent french toast for just those reasons.

Not enough sour flavor.  Mostly because you add a lot more liquid and flour than the starter, so it is basically watering the starter down.  It does rise really fast compared to a traditional sourdough bread.  Also, for some reaaon my loaf was really crumbly.  Not sure if that is me or the recipe.

UPATE: Made this bread again, yesterday, and it flopped! I am not giving up that easy, and will try again...

Perhaps my starter, but bread came out like ordinary bread... no sour taste whatsoever and as I read he reviews after the fact, one mentioned that sourdough no milk... makes sense as all the other recipes I have been working with have never called for milk... UPDATE: I have done some research and read many people responses to the bread not being sour enough and it isn't caused by the recipe, it's the starter. I accidently killed my last starter and this one was born on Sept 27. I am confused through, because not only does the starter look fantastic at which point I would use for recipes, it also has a strong, very strong, sourdough smell. Going forward, I will play around with the starter by ensuring the feed is at least 8 hours prior to using and perhaps proofing in the oven for the final rise with some moisture, although this bread actually looked exactly what I'd want in a sourdough. I will update once more when I get it... I will also, perhaps, change my rating to reflect the outcome. I've seen that the people that have made and enjoyed this bread far out way those of those that didn't so perhaps I am not doing something right. Many thanks to all your posts that have given me more knowledge and insight on what I need to be doing... please feel free to post some other ideas you may have that can help. It would definitely be appreciated!

For bread in general, this was good bread. Easy to make with consistent texture, great for sandwiches or French toast. For sourdough, however, it was pretty bad. Very little sour taste; in fact I would not have been able to identify it as sourdough if I hadn't added the starter myself.

I must say I have a weakness for bread and this one did NOT disappoint!  The only thing I done differently was added a tablespoon of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of dough enhancer.  I read on another forum that lemon juice along with dough enhancer helped during the rising process.  I baked it in two normal size bread pans  Half way through the baking process I had to take the bread out and remove one of my racks because it was so tall.  I ended up putting it on the lower rack in the oven and it baked wonderfully.
I couldn't really taste the sour dough taste but, I blame that on my starter not being very old.
I thought the lemon juice would help the starter create that tangy taste of sour dough but, I couldn't taste the lemon in it at all. However I will use the lemon juice and dough enhancer from now on because I am really impressed with how well it worked.  
 I am going to try it again in a few weeks when my starter matures a little more because I think it will only get better. As for now it still deserves 5 stars :)

Great recipe! We used an 80+ year old starter. We did not use any onions...but the loaf and breakfast biscuits we made, were devoured by the grand kids. Thanks for your contribution.

Didn't taste at all like sourdough.  Didn't cook all the way through.  Was impossibly dense.  I tried it and followed the recipe EXACTLY to the letter, only omitting the onions (because onions don't belong on sourdough), and baked it for the prescribed time, plus about 10 minutes because it wasn't baking all the way through.  Had to pull it early because it was starting to get too brown on the top (egg wash) and it immediately fell, because of the raw middle.  I tasted what I could, trying to determine if even the flavor was there, but it tasted like plain white bread dough.  Simply put, I won't be baking with this recipe ever again, and it has possibly turned me off of ever attempting sourdough ever again.

Really soft and moist with a nice crust. Not sure how much I like the sugar, because it tends to make it taste more like a French bread. My starter was only 7 days old, so it might be that it was not sour enough to balance it out. I'm going to try this recipe again when the starter gets older and hope that it will balance with the added sugar and the natural sugars in the milk. If not, then I'll lessen the added sugar and go from there.

I haven't tried this yet, but I agree with KendraSF almost completely and will try it when I get my new starter.  One thing I have learned though is that because the starter is using the wild "germs" in the air when you move the starter will change flavors.  For example, the starter I had when I moved from the San Francisco bay area made bread that tasted like SF sour dough for the first time I used it.  Afterwards it lost that flavor.  It was disappointing but it continued to make great bread and pancakes for many years til my husband threw it out when we were moving.  I moved him out for a while - only a while. ;=)

Fabulous!!! I have had my starter established for only a week...it was growing like crazy and so I decided to use some up. I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. I didn't have any bread flour on hand and ended up using all purpose. I baked it on a pizza stone and had a water bath underneath. I also added crumbled bacon and onions and worked it into the dough... after the 2nd rise..I popped this baby into the oven...25 mins later it was ready with an amazing crusty crust! This will be my go to recipe for now on. :)

This was really great! I didn't get the rise I was hoping for, resulting in a slightly flat loaf, but it was still nice and slightly sour. I used less flour because of my dry climate and skipped the onions. I'll try them in the future, just wanted the pure experience. This was good fun!

I pulled out of my oven 2 beautiful loaves of bread - one I braided for a little fun! Delicious and fluffy, this bread did not have a strong sourdough taste, but none of the less disappeared in about 1 hr to my family of 5. After feeding my starter daily for about 1 week, I'd have to recommend the 'Sourdough Starter Recipe' from this website for my fellow newbie bread bakers. Thanks for sharing your recipe! :)

I quartered the recipe for my first small loaf and it was delicious.  I wish I had managed a teensy bit crisper crust.  And the inside was almost cake like.  Moist and airy.  I would like to know how to achieve those big holes and more *peasant* like bread.  My starter (Sour Dough Starter # 2) is brand new so not terribly sour but the bread had great flavor.  I will keep this recipe and keep trying to improve.

My daughter and I (she is 12) made this sourdough at Easter and again today.  A very easy to make bread with great flavour.  We are hoping that the more mature starter we now have will add a deeper sour flavour to the loaf.  Thanks!

This recipe is very good.  I prefer to add dry onion flakes to the dough @ 1 tbsp per cup of flour as an alternative to scattering fresh onions on top of the loaf.

Makes -great- toast.  The onion compliments well, and for next loaf I am going to mix in 1/4 cup minced onion.  I wonder what baking in fresh garlic from my garden would add?  One tweak at a time....

This was very good.  I used this recipe to make two loaves with my week-old starter.  I made it completely by hand, and found the hour rise was not quite enough, despite being in my oven with the light on.  I also found the 30 minutes bake time too long.   A couple weeks later, I made this recipe with my KitchenaAid, and shaped them into large kaiser rolls.  Delicious with our pulled pork sandwiches!  Maybe it was because my starter had aged, or because I let the dough rise for over two hours each stage.  Either way, I cooked the rolls for 13 minutes at 375 degrees....perfect!  (and I skipped the onion and egg wash both times). Will save to my favorites as a go to recipe.

This recipe made a bread that was DELICIOUS. It's somehow dense and light at the same time (I can't explain it, but that's definitely a good thing), and very sweet in addition to the tang I expect from sour dough. It wasn't QUITE as sour as I'd like, but I was using a pretty immature starter... and it was a sweet starter (The "Amish Friendship Bread Starter" from allrecipes).

Like another reviewer, I used water instead of milk and did not add any water to the egg wash, just the egg! Because of that first change my rise times took quite a lot longer, almost 3 hours the first time and more than 2 the second; definitely worth it, though. I microwaved water in a pyrex measuring cup until the microwave was good and warm and let them rise in there; perfect! I also sprinkled sesame seeds on top with the egg wash, I couldn't resist! Bet my neighbors will love their loaf for Christmas.

I've made this recipe twice now, and I'm planning on continuing experimenting with it, and making more tweaks until I get it how I want it.  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and I ended up having to add water because the dough was WAY too dry, and the resulting loafs were way too dense for my taste...although they were great for making a garlic cheese loaf appetizer.  
The second time I made this I let the yeast proof for 10 minutes in the warm milk and sugar before adding the rest of the ingredients, and I added the flour one cup at a time.  These alterations made for a much better rise, and the loafs were lighter, flufier, and tastier.
Next time, I'm going do the same alterations as my 'take 2', and also take the advise of a much longer rise time, as well as the egg white only egg wash...I'm also hoping that my starter is more matured by then too, for a better sour flavor, its only 2 weeks old right now but its getting better every day.
I'm hoping to use this recipe, with alterations, for some dinner rolls soon too

I've made a number of sourdough bread recipe. This is one I will use often because it is not labor intensive and the flavor is mild. JT's idea of sesame seeds is great. I made it in two loaf pans and it makes great toast or sandwich bread. Crispy crust & soft crumb. Not as chewy as other sourdough.

Made it this morning, loved it. I think the starter really makes it more or less like sourdough. BUT i thought mine was just a little too dense and compact, any ideas for a lighter fluffier bread?

Great recipe with a few modifications. First off I don't care for the onion so I eliminated the egg, water and onion from the recipe. Second, using "all" bread flour makes it too fluffy and difficult to cut so I cut the flour 50/50 with general purpose and bread flour. I don't raise my bread in front of a heat source. I lightly oil a large bowl and the dough ball,  and place it on a surface where there is good normal room temperature. No direct sun just steady temps. I raise mine for at least two sometimes three hours. I punch the dough down, let it rest for 15 then divide and form my loaves. I do not over handle my dough. I cut it in half, form it and put it on a cookie sheet to raise an additional two hours. I also lightly spray the loaves with oil, mainly to keep the plastic wrap from sticking. I weigh my flour. There is so much variance in packed and unpacked flour I found 120 grams per cup works perfectly every time. I only use King Arthur flours. These flours are non Bro-mated and healthier. If you are diabetic or pre-diabetic, Sourdough has been shown to be better for you. Or at least not as bad as other breads. The sour in the sourdough slows digestion thus slowing the rapid rise in blood glucose that all other flours do. Just a tid bit fact. Do the research yourself.

I have made this several times and it is amazing.  It slices well for sandwiches or toast, and it tastes great every time.  I did not have luck using the dough setting on the bread machine, guess it does have to be hand-kneaded, but it's actually pretty fun.  I used the "Sourdough Starter II" recipe from this website for the starter.

This is my husband's favorite bread!  It took a couple months to really get our starter to the point of a strong sour dough flavor, but in the mean time I made everything with this bread recipe - even my cinnamon rolls!

I used Sourdough Starter from Esther Nelson (wonderful) but had to add more flour as I kneaded the dough (summertime in Florida).  I shaped the dough into rolls but when I brushed them with egg white, they deflated!?!  Not very pretty but very good flavor!  (omitted onion this time but will use next)

We love this bread. I have made it five or six times and gotten great results. It does have a fairly mild sourdough flavor, I think because of the short rising time; I have also gotten milder/stronger results depending on how active my starter was at the time. I want to try omitting the yeast packet and letting it rise overnight for a more "traditional" sourdough, but I haven't yet because it's so good the way it is!

I made these 2 ways at the same time to make small soup bowls in larger cupcake molds for TDay dinner.  One batch I made with the modifications KendraSF suggested.  One batch was made the way they've written but no onions.  I consider myself an intermediate break maker and do it at least weekly if not more... Both mixed fairly easily but the modified one was a LOT tougher than the other; when they were left to rise, the modified batch rose round but bumpy and the other batch rose nice and soft looking.  I had to put some in the fridge overnight and the nonmodifed batch sank a little.  Both baked nicely and looked great with egg yolk - a nice touch (we noticed a couple that didn't get it and they weren't as pretty) and both sets tasted GREAT!  For a soup bowl, the modified was much denser and held up better, but overall I'd say it's a fabulous recipe!

I made this with Sourdough Starter from this site, by Esther.  I aged it only 7 days, so the dough could be a little more sour, but overall, a great bread! I made bread bowls for clam chowder...

This bread turned out well, although it tasted and felt more like a good French bread. Could have been because my starter only sat for 48 hours before I used it. Next time I will let it sit for up to five days.

I tried this recipe and it turned out wonderfully! I've been making sourdough with (only) starter for about 10 months and it has been very good !-  But this recipe has transformed it into a softer more mouth friendly loaf of bread!! I guess purists would say its a hybrid.. I love it!!

This is very yummy! Of course the starter has everything to do with it. I am still a novice, but I am learning to "feed" my starter, and the results have been great. The kids love it, even with the onion topping! Shocker!

This is a light fluffy bread! Rating on taste and texture I give it 5 stars, but the directions were off a bit. I only added about 4 cups of flour because my dough felt about the right consistency at that point. I also had to reduce the cooking time dramatically to about 15 minutes. I ended up making a braided bread for a party sub, so I did not think the cooking time would be less. I even checked the temp about 5 times to make sure I did not make a mistake, but the temp was right, and my bread was done in 15 minutes. I also added fresh grated Parmesan to the top, not onion. I am making this bread for our next football party! So good!

This was very good!  I put it all in bread machine and pulled out after the kneading process.  I did use butter in place of margarine and didnt do the egg wash/onion on top.  Very tasty toasted in the morning as well:)

Let me just say that SF sourdough bread is no longer possible in SF only.  unbeknownst to them, SF gave the La Brea Los Angeles Bakery the "best SF sourdough" award in a contest, and went ballistic when they found out that the winner was not a San Franciscan!  Tests on the SF water proved wrong all claims that SF sourdough bread can only be made there!  Whether a beginner or an expert in sourdough bread this recipe is all you need.

I made a error by not reading throughly and added the egg to the dough instead of saving for the egg wash, oops.  did not matter this was the best bread ever.  I have remade over and over this is great.

I live in the Netherlands and cant find sourdough bread here. I was really craving some grilled sandwiches on sourdough bread. I used this recipe, minus the onions, with the starter from Ester Nelson. It was great! This was my first attempt at bread making and I couldn't believe how easy it was. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent recipe! Giving it 4 instead of 5 because it is not a traditional San Francisco soughdough recipe. I lived in San Francisco and they use corn meal on the baking sheet instead of oil and do not normally add chopped onions but the option is available. (of course, that was 10 years ago, may have changed) That said, both with and without the onions is excellent and even better with the cornmeal baked into the bottom. I formed one loaf oblong onto a baking sheet and one round onto a baking sheet. Have to be careful with the egg wash step because I lost some of the rise. Out of 2 loaves only half of one was left the next day. (husband called it the best bread I'd made and he'd raved about my honey wheat before this) Will be making the recipe again this weekend as the starter is more mature now and has a great sour smell to it.

I have an Alaskan starter over 100 years old and this is the recipe that finally does it justice!  All other loaves have come out way too sour or just failed to satisfy in some way.  This is a keeper for my starter now.  Next time I'll try leaving out the commercial yeast and seeing how well it rises on it's own. :)

This bread is incredible. I have never had much success making bread, but this bread turned out very well. I sprayed the sides of my stove with water and instead of putting onions on top I brushed the top with olive oil and honey. My starter is really new so the sour taste was faint, but that seems to be the general consensus from other reviewers. With some age the the starter should improve. This bread was great though!

Used my starter(from this website) after only 4 days, but, the bread came out delicious and very authentic to a rustic sourdough. The loaf didn't rise as much as I would have liked but the round I made raised nicely!I did use 2 cups of the starter instead of 1 1/2 (just add a little more flour to recipe to balance)and added just a pinch more yeast to the bread recipe and was able to make 2 loaves without any problem. Delicious! I highly recommend this recipe. My whole family loved it; even a few days later! My house is a little cold, so I rose the dough in the oven after letting it heat up to 150 degrees and then turning the oven off and leaving the light on, it worked perfectly.  Good luck!

I just pulled two loaves of this bread out of the oven, and it is one of the best sourdough breads I have eaten.  It was simple and easy.  I would ask every one to try this bread, if you like sourdough you will love it.

My starter is several weeks old so I expected it to be more like the "real" SF bread I ate when we lived in California.  I might increase the amount of starter next time.  A good bread, not a great one.

This recipe is very good. It makes a light, soft bread that is perfect for sandwiches, grilled cheese, and garlic bread. But, I must agree with other reviewers that although this is an excellent white bread recipe there is really not much sourdough flavor to it.

FANTASTIC!!!!! I would give this a 10 if I could. I live in wyoming so baking can be a bit tricky. I used starter II and waited until day 6. It had a nice but mild sourdough taste we used it to make BLT's my family wants me to make another loaf for sandwiches for the week. overall excellant recipe.

This recipe is really forgiving for bread.  I messed up the recipe by mixing in all the flour at once and my sourdough starter was not quiet ready but the bread still turned out really well.  Instead of sourdough bread I ended up with really good white bread.

For some reason, the dough did not rise. I baked it anyway and it rose a little in the oven.  I don't know if this is because the yeast was added in with the dry ingredients or not.  Usually I proof the yeast first. So I will try making it at least one more time.  I did like the onion on the top.

This was excellent-great sourdough flavor. It made two 1-1/2 pound large loaves.  You could easily divide it to make three 1 pound loaves.

Great bread! I didn't use the chopped onion..I also didn't need that much flour, my starter must have been thick. But this bread was wonderful, light and soft, I will make this again!

I thought this was great! I've never had a sourdough bread before so I really don't have much to compare to, but I will definately make this again. This time I didn't use the egg wash and the chopped onions (hubby doesn't like bread with the onions cooked on it) but next time I will make one for him and I will use the egg/onions on mine! Thanks for a great recipe and to all my AR friends for all your help with the starter!!!

This turned out great! Very tasty. It was the first time I used my starter though so it wasn't all that sour. But still delicious. I didn't use the onion. Will make again.

Pretty good.  Mine didn't have a huge sourdough taste to it, my starter is only a few weeks old, but it was pretty good.  Will make again when my starter is a little more aged :)

I make homemade bread once a week and tried sourdough for the first time.  The bread is delicious.  It is the first time I used the starter so it isn't really "sour".  But still excellent taste and texture.  Delish!

Awesome Bread!  Mine turned out a little on the flat side...but it was my own fault...don't think I added enough flour.  I used sourdough starter II.  Simple bread to make!

Very good bread!  I've always left off the onions, but love how the bread turns out.  The more my starter ages the better the flavor is for this bread.  I use the sourdough starter submitted by Esther on this site.  Great combination.

I used our own left over sour dough. I did not think to even deal with potato powder or so on. I made basic dough and forgot it. I used the recommended amount of starter and it was so good. It is like a bread beer because of all the extra fermentation.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I use a wild starter made from local plums.  this recipe brings out the full flavor of my starter.  Thank you.  It is also incredibly versatile I use it for pizza as well; it comes out soft and crisp on the outside

I have been looking for a good bread recipe for my starter.

I have found it!!

Followed the recipe but omitted the onions on top.  Made one loaf of bread and four big rolls.

Yummy and pretty too.

A wonderful, light soft white bread with just a hint of sourdough taste (but my starter was new).  Very easy to make, even for a first-time bread maker.  My family and I devoured one whole loaf right out of the over, so I'm glad this recipe makes two loaves.

Wonderful!  Very velvety texture and very fluffy!  Not the strongest tang, but my starter was pretty young.  I also didn't follow other reviewers' advice and put water in the oven to bake with and my crust isn't as thick as I wanted.  I'll try that next time.  Otherwise, very good bread and definitely a keeper!

I’ve made this bread with the bread machine (on the dough cycle) and as written.  It came out great as written, but it didn’t work in the bread machine.  As written it is very good.  I don’t know why it doesn’t work in the bread machine, but it came out beautiful using my kitchen aid mixer.  I kneaded it for about 10 minutes with the machine.  I didn’t top it with the onions as I wanted just a plain loaf.

This was absolutely amazing!  The only change I was forced into was evaporated milk versus regular milk.  I also left off the onion (I love onion, but wanted to try this without).  5++ stars.  Will definitely make again.

WOW!  This recipe made two of the most beautiful loaves of bread!  Instead of using chopped onion on top, I sprinkled some Krazy Janes Mixed up Salt!  Awesome!  I will definitely make this one again!  The starter I use is a Potato Water starter!   YUMMMM! 

Thanks for the great recipe!

Good flavor but not what I expected for a sourdough bread.  As you can see from the picture on my page, it's not crusty like I thought it would be.  Nonetheless, it was good bread and we paired it with tomato slices marinated in olive oil and balsalmic vinegar for lunch.

YUM!  My starter is not very mature, but I have made this recipe 3 times already, and my family LOVES it!  The texture is just amazing, and the loaves are beautiful.  I plan on making this bread often.  Thanks for this great reicpe.

This is a wonderful recipe! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour because i'm not crazy about white bread. I agree it's not very sour but it's still the best bread recipe i've found so far. So soft - great with olive oil fresh out of the oven!

This recipe did not have the taste nor texture of San Francisco sourdough.  That is, it had no sourdough flavor whatsover and the texture was soft rather than crusty and chewy.  That said, I am still giving it 5 stars because it is really good!  I made two round loaves.  They tasted like big, soft hot rolls.

My starter was only 5 days old.  I agreed with someone else who stated that it was a good white bread recipe.  It was very heavy bread, not as light as I'd expect for San Francisco sourdough.  I will try this again, hopefully it will be a little more 'sour' next time.

Pretty easy assembly and baking. I also put a pan of water in the oven during the bake. Keeps the top from cracking as much in dry climates. Makes two slightly smaller loaves for me. Makes TERRIFIC toast!

I cut the recipe in half and made more of a sourdough flatbread by scoring before the second rise, it was delicious for a smoked pepper jack Sammy! For the ingredients I used warm water, not milk and whole egg white, with a yummy egg white pool in the middle. Also, I suggest using the oven light for a cozy warming place for rising. Cheers!

I made this recipe as written. It is a very good recipe! I've had my sourdough starter for over a year and that contributed to a nice sourdough flavor and the bread itself turned out soft and delicious the way that the recipe was written. (I have no complaints over how the author named the recipe!) The only changes I made for myself was to add a container of water to the oven while proofing and baking. My home in winter is too cool for proofing so I heat the oven to 115 degrees and let the bread rise inside. Also, I used sesame seeds on top rather than the onion; personal preference.

The recipe calls for milk. I am wondering if water was used the bread might be chewier.  Next time I would not apply the egg wash before placing dough in oven.  The egg wash made the crust tender. I prefer the harder crust.

No joke the best bread I have ever made. My first load in years I didn’t use the bread machine for. Also first loaf of sour dough and first starter ever. It is not very sour but my family doesn’t want it super sour. The loaf has the absolute best consistency! Just try it, it’s worth it!!!

Good
My notes are: Use water not milk, use the best unbleached organic flour, skip the onion. Use egg white only and it is optional!

This is a recipe I’ve made several times with success every time, following the recipe as written .  Good texture and flavor.  I see a plethora of reviews commenting on sourness or lack thereof.  There are a couple of factors that play into that — the age of your starter, as some have stated, but also rise times.  Quicker rises produce milder taste, whereas a slow rise will lend towards increased sour taste.  Some do the second rise overnight in the frig; I tried that once using a not very aged starter and it was too tart for me.  I have read that different types of flour also affect the taste.  I’m currently proofing a batch made with a combo of AP, bread, and white wheat flours.  I’ll let you know how that turns out.

I love this recipe.  It isn't too sour because it also uses some yeast, and it cooks up beautifully.

This time making it I substituted cashew milk for the cow milk and canola oil for the melted butter.  I also used cashew milk in place of the egg wash.  It still turned out just as great.

A very delicious white bread.  Did not taste like sourdough with the milk, the amount of sugar and fat.  Not at all like the other sourdough recipes that I've made.

I bake this bread basically every week.  So delicious and soft.  I skip the egg/onion step and just bake it in loaf pans.  Great for sandwiches and doesn't dry out as easily as most home made bread does.

It was good, but not great.  Easy recipe to make, but just not enough of that tang that makes a great sourdough.  The crust is on the softer side, and I prefer a chewier texture than what this loaf has.

Lovely soft, flavorful bread. It made 2 round loaves.  I didn't have bread flour so  used 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 Einkorn flour. As another reviewer suggested I sprinkled corn meal on the pan and cut a slit in the dough for the 2nd rise. I also let the first part sit for an hour or so until it was very bubbly before adding the rest of the flour. Mine didn't have much of a sour dough flavor because my starter is young, only 1 week old. I was anxious to make bread though and this recipe was perfect. It rose quickly, and baked in 25 min. I will certainly make this again,  especially when I need bread quickly. The egg wash gave a lovely color. Update. I have been using 100% Einkorn flour with no problems. Einkorn is a little persnickity, don't knead too long, and leave the dough a little wet. This recipe is great for when I need bread in a hurry. If you have any that manages to go stale,  make croutons! Thank You!

I followed the recipe as written, except for one change: I replaced the onions on top with sesame seeds, because that sounded better to me.  I will definitely make again.  This recipe made two nice large loaves, and for the first time, my dough ball and subsequently the loaves rose perfectly.  Next time I will probably only use the egg white on top rather than the whole egg, as it dripped down and crusted on the bottom after baking.  Not really a problem, just something I think will look better.  Overall a tasty, great textured loaf of bread.  I didn't think it was very San Francisco-like (I am a native of that city), but for me, it was the  best sourdough bread I had made to date.  I live at high altitude, so that may impact my results, but I was happy with the bread.

Made it according to the recipe. Best Sourdough Bread I have made so far. My starter is 1 and 1/2 years old so the tangy taste came through. Good recipe and easy to follow!

This is my favorite recipe so far. I didn't have the amount of starter the recipe called for, so I used about 3/4. It turned out really good! I plan on making it again and will use the full amount of sourdough starter this time. This made perfect sandwich bread and is lovely toasted.

This is fantastic bread!  Thank you Donna!
I used my all wheat (King Arthur) sourdough starter,  added 1/4 cup more water and almost 3 cups flour instead of 3 3/4.  I let it rise a little longer both times.  It's crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and has great flavor.  I can taste the sourdough just enough!  I made it 4 times!

Although this isn't a traditional  San Fran bread, it is outstanding. The onions really give it a good twist and it's great for sandwiches as well as toast. Sometimes i need a break from the good crusty breads. This is a winner.

It was good WHITE Bread. Did not have the tang or chewiness of Sour Dough. I got a different recipe elsewhere, and made some that WAS tangy, and chewy.

TL;DR: Fantastic sourdough recipe, great for beginners, bake with steam in the oven.
This is a great basic sourdough recipe! I made it exactly as it says, but with no onions or egg wash. I will definitely be trying it with the egg wash next time, as the tops didn't get as brown as I would have liked. The bread wasn't quite sour, more mildly tangy, but I think that's because this was my first ever attempt at sourdough, and my starter is only a week old. I will be making this several more times and can't wait to taste it as my starter matures. I took another reviewer's advice and baked it with steam in the oven (I put a pan of water in the oven when I preheated, and then added more water when I put the bread in. I also sprayed the walls of my oven with water just before I put the bread in), which gave a fantastic crust.

I didn't put the onions on top, and let it sit for longer than it was supposed to (got busy and forgot about it).  The loaves were kind of flattened when I put them in the oven, so they didn't make a bread that could really be used for sandwiches, but the bread was really good.  The sour taste was not very strong, but still there.  It was light and moist and not quite as chewy as I would consider true sourdough bread, but still really good.  I will definitely make it again and will play with this recipe.

I followed the recipe except substituted water for milk.  The bread is quite tasty, and I will be using this recipe again.  I do have a little question though...  The recipe doesn't mention how many loaves, but it asks you to separate into loaves.  I made six and the thirty minutes wasn't enough.  I had to put them back in there.  I would guess it should be 8 for the 30 minute timing, though at this point, I haven't tried it.

Dont get me wrong this is a great Sourdough Bread but is nothing like SF Sourdough and looks nothing like the picture. It is not a rustic bread at all more like a french sourdough. I like it but it was nothing like what I have purchased. AGAIN, this is amazing bread with a wonderful flavor (I have some great starter right now), and texture with a soft crust but if you are looking for a crispy/crusty crust this won't be the bread for you. If you are looking for a nice warm soft loaf to have with dinner this is IT!!

I made this today and it was easy and excellent.

To those expecting a very chewy bread with gaping holes, this is not your recipe.

I made it as written but used butter, used 2 tablespoons  of sugar,  not three, and didn't add water to the egg wash.  Pretty minor changes - I also omitted the onions since this was for a group.

Some have been perplexed that this is not a tangy, chewy, crusty loaf.  Well, duh.  I make sourdough every week and this recipe makes a slightly tangy, high rise, soft crumb bread which is not a rough crusted, puckery, tough bread with a bunch of holes.

It's still a perfectly fine sourdough.  Some are unaware that sourdough is a technique, not a flavor.  Your starter will reflect your environment despite some who believe that refrigerating the starter "protects" it  from wild yeasts.  If you have air, you have yeast whether on the counter or deep in your refrigerator.

This is a fast method so if you want a sour taste (regardless of the age of your stater), use citric acid.  Or do all the steps until the first rise and just put it in the refrigerator for 4 or 5 days and then proceed.

This is an excellent recipe if your expectations are in line with what sourdough really is.

I haven't tried this yet, but I was wondering why active yeast is required if using a sourdough starter? Isn't there enough active wild yeast? Also I have over 150 year old sourdough mother hat has been passed down generation to generation from cattle roundup cowboys.

This is an EASY sourdough loaf perfect for sandwiches. It's not the chewy type of sourdough with big air pockets, but this is soft and what I like for breakfasts and lunches, and it has great flavor.  Of course only in San Francisco can you make San Fran sourdough, but this is a good sister loaf! I used a starter recipe from King Arthur that is several months old now.

I made this bread and it turned out beautifully! Followed this recipe after also following the recipe for Sourdough Starter.  Everything from scratch! My first time, I'm a beginning baker and I'm in love with it! This bread is super easy to make and was a tremendous hit to my family. Bread came out a beautiful golden color! Will post pics when I figure out how. No modifications needed.

Real sourdough is made without yeast!  The starter is enough to make it rise.
Note people with gluten intolerance (not Celiac) can usually eat sourdough made without yeast as the fermentation of the starter changes the reaction to the wheat.

This is great tasting bread, and fairly easy to make. I just finished making/using this recipe for the 3rd time. The first 2 times I used my kitchen aid mixer and dough hook. This time, I made it all my hand (kneed). Either way, the end product is the same. This time I divided the dough in half and made traditional size bread. JUST SO YOU KNOW...this recipe is not like traditional Sourdough bread...you're not going to get the large "holes". It comes out like regular bread, but you get the wonderful sourdough flavor!  I have a starter that is over 8 years old. That makes a big difference. This recipe is a keeper!

I live in Denver CO, elevation where I live is about 5300' what if any adjustments should I make for high altitude? I've never been a great Baker, but I've been nursing my starter for a couple weeks now and it looks/smells great! My step daughter is the Baker in the house, yet this will be her first attempt at making sourdough and I would like to do what I can to make sure it turns out well, any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

As a rookie sourdough bread maker, this has become my go-to recipe.  The bread always turns out amazing.  I've even substituted spelt and sprouted wheat flour and continue to achieve great results (note that the whole grains require more liquid added).

I used the starter from this site that used yeast, let it get ready over about 5 days. My first loaves were really good following exact recipe minus the onion topping. My next loaf was even better because I took reviewers advice ,let it rise overnight, and spritzed the bread and the oven during cooking to get a more crispy crust. The crust was perfect, and it had a nice sourdough taste. I am so happy I am able to make bread. I'm making my third batch tonight. This is definitely a keeper

Excellent, excellent bread recipe! I have been making sourdough bread for awhile now, and many recipes turn out a pale dense loaf. Taste okay, but visually unappealing. This bread is gorgeous - brown and rustic, with a lovely chewy crumb, but not "dense". Very nice. This will be my sourdough loaf recipe from now on!

As this contains dry active yeast I wouldn't even consider this an actual sourdough and wouldn't waste my valuable bread making  time  making this recipe.

I made this bread twice, with a healthy starter, following the recipe exactly - and both times I was left with a very wide, flat loaf. The taste was good, but the shape didn't work for me.

I tried to cut this recipe in half the first time and it didn't turn out. Made it again today and it turned out tons better. Love the little bit of salty finish.

This recipe makes delicious bread with a perfect texture and a chewy crust, but as been said before it is not sour dough bread.  I have well aged San Francisco starter which I use to make bread with a pronounced sour taste.  It takes a 24 hour process.   However, I love this bread and will continue to make it often.

Bread tastes great, the reason this recipe get a 3 instead of a 5. Is because if you are an inexperienced bread maker , this recipe will be very difficult to succeed with. The directions are marginal athe best, I have never kneaded a loaf of bread by hand for less than 20 mins, and it throws in a mystery tablespoon of water with no explanation of its use just to add to the confusion.

Great recipe!  I let my bread maker do the work up through the first rising- it turned out great, but overflowed my 2-lb bread pan (fun times cleaning THAT up!), so next time I'll make 2/3 the recipe for one big loaf.  I'll also use more flour, as even with an extra cup or so my loaves flattened out quite a bit.  That was my fault- I really should have known better because of the way it felt.  Anyhow, the flavor is great and no one at my house is complaining, so this is a keeper!

I love this recipe. I found a recipe for sourdough starter and made it according to recipe about a couple weeks before making this recipe. I have made it several times since and it is easy and delicious. I don't care too much for a strong sourdough taste so this is perfect for me. It even makes great rolls. I do like the whole egg wash as I have found it to give a better golden color and texture to the bread.

I made this recipe and shaped the dough into ten 4.75 oz  rolls to serve with baked spaghetti. Instead of brushing the rolls with egg wash I spritzed them with water, threw in 1/2 cup of water into the bottom of the oven for steam, and baked them at 400F for 20-22 minutes. Heaven!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this today but started it yesterday. I found the dough quite heavy and it took a lot of work to knead it. I used 2 cups of healthy sourdough starter and omitted the yeast. By the time it had completed its first rise, I didn't feel like continuing yesterday. So I stuck the covered bowl in the fridge overnight. This morning when I took it out, the dough had deflated a little, but I wasn't too concerned. I continued with the recipe and ended up with 2 boule-ish looking loaves, a little on the small side. The sourdough flavour didn't come through much, but this bread does have good texture. I'm going to continue looking for sourdough bread I can make in a day and if I can't will go back to no-knead bread baking. I enjoyed this trial recipe except for the struggle to knead.

My sourdough starter wasnt very "sourdoughy" so it didnt have a good sourdough flavor. The texture and taste was excellent though. Im going to order another SD starter and try again in a few weeks.
Great recipe though, I'd make it again

I get a fantastic  rise without commercial  yeast.  Starter if done right is very bubbly.  Make sure the sponge starter has proofed well.  Mine doubles after feeding done.  It  just takes patience for yeast multiplication.

This recipe works perfect however make for sure you order sourdough starter is really fermented for a better taste. I did add some parmesan on top along with crushed red pepper in a drop of olive oil smeared on top. More of a Tex Mex sourdough I tried to create.

Except for the onion I made as directed. I used the sourdough ll starter recipe to make the bread. Wonderful choice. Bread is crusty with nice texture. I will try some of the recommendations that others have mentioned. Looking forward to Thanksgiving. I know it will be a hit.

Made this today, texture is good and crust is not quite as hard as I expected it to be, but overall, very tasty. Starter was very sour, given to me by a friend. Used minced onion flakes after egg wash and that added a beautiful aroma. Will make again.

Like others said, my starter is new and I am sure this will be super fantastic once my starter is matured.  I did do one thing different and that was I had a piece of leftover dough (actually I snitched about 2.5 ounce piece of dough when I made pizza  and put it in the fridge til my starter was ready) and tore it into pieces and put it in with the starter.   Turned out very good!

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I have made this delicious bread several  times and shared it with many friends.  They all love it as well!  I substituted the milk for  1/2 cup of half and half  combined with 1/2 cup of water. I found this to produce a lovely texture.  Also, cornmeal lightly sprinkled on the bottom of the baking pan adds character.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Donna!

I'm a newbie to REAL bread making. I've tried a few recipes in my bread machine before with limited success but have NEVER considered making bread the "hard" way. However, I am now a complete convert. I used the very simple Sourdough Starter II, which I let sit for 72 hours. I used all purpose flour because that's what I had, and honestly, didn't expect any of this to work anyway. I also  used butter, deleted the egg and onion toppings and used two bread pans to bake the bread. I even decided to knead the dough by hand. OMG!!  My hubby and I ate half a loaf in 5 minutes !!!  I haven't eaten that much bread at one time since I was a kid!  This and the starter are both keepers!!  We're on the move a lot, but we were home for the evening so it was no problem to make. I can see this as a staple in our home from now on. It's absolutely scrumptious and has NO ingredients that I can't pronounce. Can't wait to see how it tastes as my starter matures. Thank you for such a great recipe!!

The recipe was excellent.  The loaf browned well with the addition of the pan of water to the oven as well as I sprtized the loaf every 10 minutes.  I did use a mixer with a dough hook to mix the ingredients.  I made two loaves which came out beautiful.  I'll use this recipe again.  For those looking for a rustic recipe try KA's Rustic Sourdough.

Hmmm... This came out good but more like a traditional white bread. I used a good starter and followed the recipe. I am new to bread making so I don't know what went wrong. I will try it again but maybe let the dough ferment with my starter before I knead it. I suspect my cold, dry, high altitude environment had a negative effect. Otherwise, the bread is a nice texture. Thanks for sharing.

This bread was very easy and tasted good.  We really enjoyed it for french toast.  I will make again soon to see how much my sourdough starter has changed.   I did not add the onions or do the egg wash.

Very tasty bread, but not what I was hoping for. I used the "Herman" starter - maybe that was too sweet?  I also substituted 1 C of the bread flour with whole wheat flour.  The initial rise took several hours and wasn't as much as I would expect. The second rise also took a long time (overnight).  Maybe the yeast should have been proofed first, but I'll blame it on the starter for now.  I'm going to try a different starter and will report back.  (I also left off the onions for the reasons stated by others.)

Pretty good bread!  I used the "Sourdough Starter I" from this site that my mom's been tending to the last couple of weeks.  It did not produce a very tangy bread but I've read the flavor of the starter develops over a few weeks so we'll see.  We used AP flour and omitted the onions because we were out.  We love onions so we'll try this again when we have all the ingredients.  If you're an onion lover try the "Soft Onion Sandwich Rolls" from this site -they're excellent!

WOW!!! I have NEVER made bread before so I was very shocked at how good these loafs came out!  I did one with onions and poppy seeds and the other with sesame seeds... I will know for the next time to cover the top of the loaf with onions for the last 10 mins, they do tend to get a little too dark...  

I used the herman sourdough starter which is amazing to say the least!

The bread came out nicely but it did not have much of a sourdough taste (I think that may have been my starter).  I made two nice size loaves and the bread is excellent for sandwiches and toast.  I left off the onions and don't think I missed anything by doing so. I also baked this on a pizza stone which worked out incredibly well.

This bread turned out perfectly!  It tasted a little differently than the sourdough I'm used to, but it was still yummy!  I did omit the onions, though.  Just thought it would be better w/o.  Thanks for recipe, will definately be making this one again!

I used my own starter on this one and it was fantastic. 
Split up the dough just slightly for making some pizza for dinner and the rest was entirely dedicated to a 9" round pan. Came out perfectly. I used the thinly sliced onions on the top and I have to say, it adds a nice touch.

Very nice slightly sour white bread. I skipped the first rise and the egg wash/onion. So far this is the only sourdough bread that I have ever made, I've made it twice with a newish starter and it worked well.

Incredible white bread. Not much sourdough flavor since the packaged yeast will overwhelm the more delicate sourdough flavor. For real sourdough bread you only need water, starter, salt and flour. Look for berkley sourdough. that said, this is a great bread! I top it with sesame seeds.

It's just really good.  Being at high altitude I have to put in less flour. Overall, it is a family favorite.

Maybe it's because I'm in London and the climate is different, but this recipe did not work for me at all.  My starter was only two weeks old as well, so not very mature.  
I had to take it out of the oven before the inside was done because the outside was quite brown.  I have cooked other breads and cookies in that oven, so I don't think that was it.  The inside was dense and undercooked.  
The bread did not taste sour at all, and  is pretty inedible.  Maybe I can feed it to the ducks.  
Maybe I will wait another two weeks and try this recipe again.

Very good recipe overall, but even with the steam, I could not get a crisp crust as I like.  Nice flavor and texture though for such a simple recipe.

This was very nice but I made it into rolls and they were a little hard. I suggest just using it as a loaf.

I have made this a few times.  The first time, my starter wasn't very mature, but the other times--WHOA!--it was fantastic!  I don't use the onions but it is great!  Since my family won't eat 2 loaves, I give one to my in-laws or a friend.  This one is a keeper!

This was the first time I tried to make bread and it came out pretty good! I even screwed it up and it still came out tasty and nice-looking. A "keeper" recipe.

I have made this successful bread several times. Once I starting adding flour before the "starter" and the bread still did fine.  Not every time do I add the onion topping to my loaves. The bread recipe alone is a tasty and simple way to make sourdough loaves or rolls. Thank you for sharing.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have been cutting it in half and making one loaf at a time.  I am eager to make sourdough bowls for some creamy soup.  YUM!
