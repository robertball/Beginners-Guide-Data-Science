This is even better with Smirnoff Whipped Vodka. This is one of my most favorite cocktails. NOTE: If you do not have orange juice, equal amounts orange soda will work well in a pinch.

If you aren't a vodka fan, but want that creamsicle taste, use vanilla schnapps.

Delish! I'm usually more of a cran and vodka girl myself, but the vanilla was a nice twist.

This is good, it tastes like an Orange Julius with alcohol, but it is VERY strong, next time I will use more orange juice.

I was skeptical when I first read the reviews but I have to say, this really does taste like a creamsicle.  Very good and a keeper recipe.

I also thought this drink would be too strong for my taste so I added 2 scoops of vanilla/orange swirl ice cream and this took this drink over the top. I wouldn't ordinarily rate something unless I followed the recipe to a 'T' but this tasted so good I had to share. I also threw a couple of ice cubes in the blender & mixed it all together..DELISH!

This was good - a nice change from a traditional screwdriver.

So I didn't have vanilla vodka so I added 1 tbs of vanilla extract to 3oz of vodka, and added OJ this is delicious. This really does remind me of a Creamsicle, only with alcohol!!!
