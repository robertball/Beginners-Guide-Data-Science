Delicious! I used Turbinado sugar instead of white, coconut oil instead of canola, and white distilled vinegar instead of acv. I'm not vegan but my husband and daughter is and we all loved it.

This is a great recipe! Very dark, rich, and flavorful, with a semi-dense texture. I didn't have milk and was low on eggs, so I made this cake and it tastes very good.

I turned it into cupcakes.  Followed the recipe precisely.  But used a cupcakes form.  Tried it 3 times. Tasted great.  I have added cranberries, blueberries (turned out a bit too moist), raisins and walnuts, i mean the options are great.  Perfect texture, great taste (did you say vinegar?). Highly recommend!

I used cupcakes form. Great taste, right texture. Would never tell its vegan, no smell of vinegar. Second time, I made it with raisins, then walnuts. Highly recommend

My mother inlaw Alice was alergic to eggs and egg producks she also use to make this cake,I am making this recipe followed instruction to the letter ,tasted the batter and there is no vinegar taste but i mixed all the liquid ingrediants in a separte bowl and added to dry ingediants a little at a time beating well with a whisk between additions.Batter is smooth and dark.Baked the cake it is high and smells great.I think for those who said it taste like vinegar the trick is to mix the liguid ingrediants.I am going to ice this cake with nutriwhip which is a milk free oil based whip cream that need to be beaten and top it with fresh fruit. One thing i did notice it took almost an hour to cook. Hope my vegan friend likes it.

Turned out great and was easy to make. Made this for a co-worker's farewell party who is vegan and even the non-vegans enjoyed!

I made this just last night for my son's birthday party tomorrow evening. The taste turned out great, dark and rich, but it did take at least an hour to cook all the way through. I am at high altitude so may it was partly due to that, but I have never experienced such a drastically different cook time with any other baked goods I've made. Still, it has a great taste and I'm excited to frosting it up! I made two cakes as I am double stacking the masterpiece birthday cake, with buttercream frosting and raspberries in the middle, then a tie-dye pour over frosting to top it!

I hated it to be honest. It was too moist and I think the vinegar ruined it. I refused to eat it after my first bite. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because my friend actually thought it was ok .

I would suggest using a nice quality cocoa powder to really get that chocolate flavor. The cake came out great! It was light and moist. Definitely would make it again!

This was easy to make and turned out great! I topped mine with some white icing and coconut. This was a huge (and delicious and vegan) hit!

Excellent taste and texture, easy to bake, vegan-friendly. The non-vegans among us (myself included) couldn't tell the difference.

yum!!! The texture was great. This cake was moist and raised nicely. The only thing I would change is to add a little vanilla and maybe a little more cocoa. I am not a vegan, but made this for my son's girlfriend, for her birthday. This cake was very satisfying. We all enjoyed it.

This is delicious! I used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and one cup unbleached white flour. I will use all whole wheat pastry next time. I also used coconut oil in place of canola. Will try applesauce next time and reduce the sugar and oil. Great recipe!

I did not care for this. I made this following the recipe exactly.
