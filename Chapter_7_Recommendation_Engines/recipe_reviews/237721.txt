This was amazing!  The multi-grain medley is my new favorite go-to weeknight side. A nice alternative to regular rice or having quinoa on it's on. I loved it in this dish with the egg.

I used what I had leftover from a party the day before. Fresh snow peas, broccoli, orange and yellow peppers with grilled chicken.  I added soy sauce and used a powdered red miso soup mix since I didn't have the Chinese spice. I also added Quinoa to basmati rice since I didn't have minute rice multigrain. It turned out fantastic!  My 9 yo daughter is asking if we can make it tomorrow.

Great recipe! I used regular rice and leftover rotisserie chicken! IMO the five spice really makes this dish awesome!

Liked this very much... next time we might try introducing a little citrus or heat... felt it needed some zing.
