I have a cake business and am constantly looking for good recipes. I decided to try this recipe for an order. I don't care for coconut, so I was going on faith. The customers LOVED this cake! I had such positive feedback that I will be using this for future Italian Cream Cake orders. Thanks!!!

A co-worker of my husband asked me to bake for her for Christmas and she asked for an Italian Cream Cake.  I had never made one, so this is the recipe I settled on.  She said she didn't want coconut, so I left it out...but added 1 t. of coconut extract for the flavor. Other than than I made the cake exactly by the recipe.  I doubled the frosting recipe because I wanted to be sure that I had enough left over to decorate with..and I had plenty with even some left over.  You need a lot just because it's such a tall cake with the three layers.  Anyway, she said everyone loved it...and that the frosting was delicious!  I even took a picture of it and posted it...I was very pleased!

First off, this cake was great! I changed things up a bit, it may be something you might want to consider. The first thing I did differently was instead of round pans I used a 9X13 slab. It was easier to transport and cut, I was able to get 16 very generous pieces, you could get more if you cut smaller, next time I will. Since this was following Christmas dinner I wanted to lighten things up a little (I dont mean calories here) So I used the cream cheese frosting in the middle, and a thin layer on top (I cut the whole slab in 1/2), and then frosted the whole outside with sweetened whip cream. I think if I frosted the whole thing with the cream cheese it would have been to much for our already stuffed bellies. You will have a bit of leftover creamcheese icing, ice some cookies or something. It was a really good cake, the only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars was because it was a little denser than I would have liked but I did cut the cake in 1/2 while it was still warm so that may have caused a little deflation so I will never know if it was supposed to be like that or if it was my own fault. Probably the latter. It was pretty  tasty though.

This is my new favorite cake!!!!! Followed the recipe exactly except I made 1.5 times the amount of icing, the original amount just wasn't enough to generously ice three layers of cake. Next time I may reduce the coconut, just a personal preference, but it was delicious!!!

Tip: to make beating the whites to peaks easier, be sure to separate them and then let them sit at room temp for a bit.

Excellent and very easy. I only used 1 cup coconut and I added 1 tsp of Almond Extract for the authenic Italian cake. So good. Next time I may decrease the coconut to 3/4 cup.

I'm not a very good baker.  Most of my baking is right out of the box.  This is an excellent cake.  My friends and family loved it.  My biggest fear of scratch baking is a dry cake.  This is a very moist cake that is so delicious.  I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I also used butter instead of margarine.  I doubled the cream cheese and butter but not the powdered sugar for the icing. 
This is a keeper!

Great recipe.  Some ideas:  put lemon or lime curd in between the layers and on the top of the cake.  Add some toasted crushed pecans to the icing and top the cake (and curd) with toasted coconut.  Beautiful presentation and the tartness of the curd is a wonderful complement to the sweetness of the cake.  You'll REALLY enjoy this recipe.

I have made this cake twice.  Turned out perfect each time.  My DH loves it and it is now his most requested cake.  Didn't change a thing about the recipe.  I added chopped pecans to the frosting and put both pecans and coconut in the batter.

Delicious and moist cake!  I ground the nuts that were going into the cake batter instead of leaving them chopped.  I personally don't like chunks in my cake.  I also did not mix in the coconut or nuts with the icing because I wanted it to be completely smooth, not lumpy.  Toasted nuts just went around the edges for a decorative touch.

This was sooooo wonderful.  I put the icing inbetween the layers of cake while it was still warm and the icing melted a little and made it so moist.  If you are going to be making this cake for kids you probably want to leave out the nuts though.  I didn't use coconut because I don't like it.

Holy banana- this cake was amazing!  It turned out perfect!!! And no one could believe I made it!  I used parchment paper in the bottom of the pans instead of greasing and flouring.  I used chopped nuts (pecans) to cover the outside edge over the frosting.  Then I toasted some coconut and put it on top and sliced about 4 maraschino cherries and put the halves randomly on the top of the coconut. It looked like something from a magazine!  =)

I made this cake for my husbands b-day. I used 2 9-in round pans because thats what I had, and ended up with enough batter for about 6 cupcakes as well. I doubled the icing recipe, but used about 2 cups less sugar total. I think I could have used even less sugar, because the icing was still a little much. I think next time I will throw the nuts and coconut for a spin in the food processor prior to mixing them in as well, since it was a little chunky. Other than that, this is my and my husbands new favorite cake. We had a few people over, and there weren't even any leftovers. It was exactly what I was looking for, and was definitely not dense as other reviewers said. Light and fluffy, but rich. So good.

This was a wonderful cake! I didn't have buttermilk so I soured some milk w/a wee bit of vinegar.Worked well. I did cheat on the icing part..I used Betty Crocker cream cheese icing and added 8 oz. of cream cheese to it! That was super! I do this all the time w/icing for cakes everyone thinks its homemade,I say "Thanks" ! thanks for a Great recipe,will make this often!

I made this in 2 9" round pans because that's all I have.  I split each into 2 giving 4 layers.  I reduced the sugar for the batter to 1.5 cups and there was enough sweetness with that; I'll try 1.T25 cups next time. Since I have an extra layer to fill, I whipped 1 cup whipping cream and folded that to the frosting.  Again, I reduced the sugar - to 3 cups.  There was just enough frosting to fill and frost the entire cake but would use 2 cups sugar for the frosting next time.  The cake is moist, tender, and has a nice flavor but is too sweet.  I will definitely use this recipe again but with less sugar for the batter and frosting.

My daughter wanted an Italian Wedding Cake for her 21st birthday.  This was a wonderful recipe.  She hates nuts so I omitted them.  Although I would have loved them, I didn't miss them - this cake is so moist and flavorful.  I used cake flour, all butter, added 1/2 tsp of almond flavoring to the mix.  I doubled the cream cheese in the frosting - it wasn't a thick decorator frosting but had plenty of body to stand up well.  I also cooked it in 2 10" pans and sliced the layers in half to have a 4 layer cake.  We loved it!  She took most of it back to college to MAYBE share!

This is my favorite cake & my first time making a cake from scratch other than a pound cake. I did use butter instead of the margarine feel it will give it more of a moist taste. I also grated my pecans & coconut flakes to almost like a powder form because I don't like chunky cake unless it carrot cake. Because of how I grated down the pecans it does change the color of the cake to a tan color looks really cool.

Make sure you fold in the egg whites last thing, I gave this 4 stars instead of five because the instructions don't tell you , but you need to kind lightly bounce the cake pans on the counter to get  any air bubble out of the mix. If you do not do this you will get parts of the cake to expand like a bubble which will kind of through off your layering. I let them cool for 15 minutes .. 

I DID NOT do the frosting as its said in this recipe,  Look up WhIPPED CREAM CREAM CHEESE FROSTING on this site.. Make this frosting its much better & REAL cream cheese frosting taste like you at a gourmet creamy  cheese Frosting.

Super delicious cake! Everyone really, really loved this one. I made a few changes, I used butter in both the cake and frosting, almond extract in the cake instead of vanilla, and I used a 9x13 pan. I baked it at 350 and it was done around 55 mins to an hour, I just kept checking. I topped the frosted cake with finely chopped pecans, shredded coconut and halved maraschino cherries. It was pretty as well as exceptionally delicious. It is very rich and on the dense side, but I love cakes like this! I will use this recipe for Italian cream cakes from now on, it was the perfect ending to my Italian dinner party. Thank you for this wonderful recipe :)

I made this for Thanksgiving and WOW!  The only variation I made was that I split each of the three layers and filled the split layers with the almond cake filling recipe from this website.  I believe it made the cake very moist and added fantastic flavor.  Other than that, I followed the receipe to a "T" and it was devoured by my family of four within the week.  Given it is a HUGE cake, that is quite the compliment.  I patted chopped pecans on the sides and sprinkled additional coconut on the top and it was gorgeous!  I'll be making this again for Christmas...I haven't been given a choice.

This cake is AMAZING- but also huge. It should serve 12 people! My Dad calls this "the BEST cake in the world"- and he is probably right. It's so moist and flavorful, just make sure you replace the shortening and margarine with butter. Also toast 1/2 c. coconut to put on the outside of the cake with the 1/2 c. pecans. And for the frosting, I only used 2 c. powdered sugar.

I made this on a Saturday afternoon, just because I enjoy baking.  I took some to my mother who shared it with the ladies she works with.  One of her co-workers is paying me to make another cake since the taste she had was not enough!  It is a wonderfully, well textured cake and shows beautifully.

I can't believe how good this cake was.  Usually, I find homemade cakes to be on the drier side, but that was not the case with this cake. The only changes I made was to substitute 1 teaspoon of almond extract for the vanilla and I reduced the coconut to about 3/4 of a cup.  I also baked it in 3 9 inch pans and the cake still had some serious height!  Great recipe...thanks!

I used hazelnuts instead of the walnuts and soaked each layer with amaretto before frosting. It was amazing!

This cake was fun to make, so easy! Buttercream icing was delicious on it-I don't care for cream cheese icing. I took it to work and people remarked it tasted like a gourmet cake from a bakery. Thank so much for a great recipe.

I made this cake yesterday and it was a hit with everyone!  Instead of margarine, I used butter and replaced shortening with coconut oil.  Using unsweetened coconut, i reduced that amount to a scant 1 cup.  To make the icing, I used half butter and half coconut oil.  Rather than increasing the amount of icing, I used the cream cheese icing between the layers and then whipped 1 cup of heavy cream, unsweetened, and blended that with the remainder of the cream cheese icing and frosted the top and sides with that.  Less sweet but still rich and creamy!

I made this in cupcakes for Easter dessert and my Dad particularly LOVED it. The leftovers went to DH's work on Monday (made them Saturday) and despite several days in the fridge they were still tender and tasty. They did seem a little greasy when fresh-baked but after a day or so in the fridge that sensation completely mellowed out into goodness. I toasted my coconut and pecans and chopped them in the food processor so I could have an even distribution of goodies throughout my cake & frosting. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a party.  Friends liked it, although they mentioned the frosting tasted like pure sugar.  I added to the presentation by dying coconut red and sprinkling it on top of the case.  I omitted pecans, and like other reviewers, kept the coconut separate from the frosting.

Everyone liked this cake- except for me.  It had the texture of a bad carrot cake- I definitely expected something more moist.   And the recipe for the icing needed to be doubled to ice three layers.  Because the family liked it, I will make it again,  however, I will double the icing, use WAY less nuts and coconut in the batter, and more to garnish the cake.  I will also probably use almond extract for a more authentic flavor.

Seeing as my husband and I don't really like your typical birthday cake very much, it was delightful that we loved this so much!  I guess the extra step of beating the egg whites, the butter milk, and the cream cheese in the icing made the difference.  I omited all nuts, did put 1 c. coconut in the icing, and omited the shorting in the cake and only used 1/2 cup of butter (not margerine).  I used all butter (no margerine) in the icing too.  Great recipe!  Worth the work.  The coconut flavor is subtle, but really "makes the cake!"

Absolutely the best thing I have EVER BAKED!!  I received so many compliments, I have people begging me to bake for them.  The only thing I changed was I added more vanilla and nuts to the batter, and I added chopped nuts and coconut to the frosting.  My son took a piece to work (a well-known deli chain restaurant) with him and the entire place is hounding me to bake a whole cake for them.  Don't share this cake with people unless you want to bake for them later!!

Oh my... this cake is to die for! I absolutely love it. I have made it three times for different occassions and get fabulous reviews. I make it just like the recipe says, as a three layer cake. After I frost it, I press chopped pecans around the side and pile coconut on top. It looks, and tastes, like a million bucks. Thanks for my new favorite cake recipe!

I researched several different recipes and reviews before picking this one. It was the best collaboration of those recipes and comments/suggestions; and, it turned out WONDERFUL!!
I do have a few comments/suggestions of my own that I applied while preparing this cake. For someone who hasnt baked alot, it's mainly things I have learned to do thru my experiences in the kitchen and from my mom and grandmother. So, here they are:
1. I baked at 325 for 35 minutes. 
2. I lined my pans with wax paper
3. I had all my ingredients set out and premeasured before I began. Including separating the eggs. 
4. I did not prepare the egg whites first, I allowed the egg whites to sit until it was time to use them in the recipe, and whipped them at that time. My grandmother taught me when making a meringue, it works best when the egg whites are room temperature, ALWAYS in a glass bowl, and make sure to wipe out the bowl with a dry paper towel before use. Even 1 grain of salt or bit of flour in the bowl. (For some reason, you will not get the real nice fluff in a plastic bowl or if there is the smallest amount of foreign substance in the bowl). Also, I didn't have to use this trick, but was prepared to add a pinch of cream of tartar, if the egg whites didn't thicken up and raise like I wanted.
5. It's my suspicion this recipe is one you MUST follow the mixing directions to a tee. Don't try to skip a step by mixing more ingredients in before it says to do so. For example, make sure your margarine

I'm waiting for my cupcakes to cool. I have never had such a moist cake in my life!! I'm sure the icing will be fantastic too!!! The only change I made was to whack the pecans a few times with a mug to make smaller pieces. I can't wait until my neighbors taste! !

Fantastic! I use half almond flour and half white flour. I also use coconut oil in place of the marg/butter. It is perfect. Also, I do believe raspberry jam in between the layers along with the cream cheese frosting and fresh raspberries on top is best! This is the recipe I use every year for my husband's birthday.

This cake was a huge hit! I own a home bakery and have been searching for the perfect mix of moist, decadent and just the perfect amount sweetness. I made this recipe as is, with the exception of using almond extract in place of vanilla, which I do in 99% of my baking.

This was over the top.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of increasing the icing by half.  Just enough to generoulsy frost the cake.  It was easy to make and a real hit at our dinner party last night.  Will make again and again.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. I prepared the layers a day ahead and put them in the fridge to firm up.  Then put the cake back in the fridge after frosting... (dusting the sides with the crushed pecans was probably the hardest part!) 

He loved the cake!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful (easy) recipe...

I used a mini food chopper to grind down the coconut flakes into almost powder consistency. Also I used sliced almonds in lieu of the other nuts mentioned, and again ground them down. I don't like chunky cake. I patted sliced almonds on the sides, and garnished with strawberry. Do yourself a favor and make this cake but use the Whipped Cream Cheese frosting from this site. OMG, it is the best thing I've ever made!

I followed the recipe exactly and found that it was MUCH to sweet, rich and dense for my family. It is a beautiful cake and my husband said he liked it. Beware - a little slice is all you need! I'm not sure that I will make this again.

Make the frosting in advance and put it in the fridge for a few hours to stiffen up. Makes frosting much easier. I didn't know that and did it as soon as the cake was cool. The layers kept slipping around and the icing kept falling off the sides. While this is probably old hat for the more experienced, i've never made a cake before and had no idea. Delicious recipe though. I left the nuts and coconut flakes off as mentioned in another review, but used a couple tsp's of coconut extract in the batter. Everybody loved it.

This is the same recipe my Grandma used. It's heavenly. You absolutely must separate and whip the egg whites, though. I fold them in as the very last step. Don't overmix. This is great as a 9x13 or as a stacked cake. So yummy.

I made this cake exactly as written and in my opinion was just okay. No offense to the author of this recipe but i just thought it was a little plain tasting. It was a little too dense for my taste. Thanks anyway!.

This recipe is the best!!! I made this for a friend at work. She said her mom made Italian cream cake. She had not had any for some time since her mom past away. My co-worker loved it and said it was just like her moms. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a great cake I took it to church for after Mass. Since I go to an Italian church I was hesitant but it was a big hit. One of the ushers wanted to know where I bought it.

This cake was amazing! It was a big hit at a work potluck! Myself being Italian has had a few Italian cakes in my day but this one was the best! I added a little less coconut and a little more nuts! It was so moist and full of flavor!

This cake is great as it!! Except, make extra frosting...but other than that...great, great, great!! Oh, I didn't have buttermilk, so I did the "let 1c milk sit with 1TB vinegar for 10 min" thing. Side Note: I never buy buttermilk... This cake was awesome. Perfectly moist, and I even messed up the egg white step! If I knew how to do the whole fondant thing, I would with this recipe. Try it now!!!

No problems with the cake itself, but the amount of cream cheese for frosting is incorrect.  It is an Icky thick, unspreadable mess unless you use TWO (not one, as stated in recipe) 8 oz. packages of cream cheese.  Two star deduction for inaccuracy and inconvenience of having to do a last-minute run to store to fetch more cream cheese.

Followed except for the nuts: put 1 cup finely chopped pecans in batter and used the rest to sprinkle on top of frosting between layers and on the side. Then I added coconut only to the sides and top, with rings of pecans there as well. (I don't like the texture of coconut in the cake.) All 3 layers and frosting just barely fit a standard cake plate and some.

Kinda bland.  Remade the second time with these changes: real butter, 1 cup ONLY toasted coconut, sifted cups of flour, and 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  I also like it better with almonds instead of pecans.

Thanks for this recipe Cyndi! I was craving a cake last night and this did not let me down. Any recipe with as much sugar as flour is going to be dense, regardless of how many egg whites you fold in! I used coconut oil in place of margarine and left out the shredded coconut just because we don't care for it. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of salt. It turned out very tasty. I will definitely make this again. I used a silicone Bundt pan and baked it for about 50 minutes.

This cake is hands down one of the best I have ever had! I get many requests to make this from family....mostly my husband. It is dense and rich but oh so good! I usually make it every Christmas. I would not make this cake all the time due to all the calories but it is worth it for a special occasion!

This was the first cake that I have made from scratch so I am sure that I made a mistake somewhere. The icing was very heavy and slid right off the sides of the cake. The cake was completely cool and I put the icing the fridge to firm up a bit while the cake cooled and it still slid. We haven't eaten yet as I made this for a holiday meal tomorrow. Will let you know the reviews of the family.

Updating my review to include that the taste was fantastic! It was a very moist cake. Even with the icing not being perfect, the family still loved it! I would possibly make this again.

I only liked chocolate cake, until NOW.... this is delish! The only thing I change is not to put pecans in the cake because I like a smooth texture... plus I noticed it stays great in the fridge for a while! yummy!

Cake is great! Done just as the recipe called for. What a great tasting flavorful cake. I did use butter instead of margarine as thats what I had on hand. HOwever, the icing was VERY sweet. I did not care for it. My husband liked it alot. I have another cream cheese icing recipe I should have used. I saw where alot of reviews called for using less sugar but I just forgot. I am sure 1 cup less would have done the trick.

We all liked this cake, but we didn't love it.  I don't think it was enjoyed any more than a regular box cake mix.  It came out very heavy, which I'm sure is how it's supposed to be, but a little too heavy for my taste.

This is the best recipie by far.only thing I do is chop my coconut up with my pecans.It is a hit and it freezes very well.beating the egg whites is the one thing that makes this recipe better than some of the others.

My mother used to make Italian Cream Cake and I don't have her recipe, so I made this one.  It was a HUGE hit--the beaten egg whites give the cake a very light texture that is perfect with the icing. I served it at an Italian-themed party and people raved about it!

I accidentally overcooked this cake.  The recipe states the baking time is "25 to 40 minutes".  That's quite a spread!  I checked it at 30 minutes, and it was a already a little over done.  Even though, it was still very good cake.  (I doubled the icing recipe, and had way more than I needed for a 3 layer cake.)

Rave reviews on this cake when I made it. I exchanged the vanilla extract for Almond extract. I also think this will be good to make the icing coffee/mocha flavor. So good!

This cake is so moist.  I made it for a family get together and everybody loved it.  I was a little nervous to make it from scratch, but it is truly the best cream cake I have ever made.  The cake is not to dense at all.  Thank You for the recipe.

My boss loves Italian Cream Cake so I made this one for her birthday. It was a huge hit. The only variation I made was that I made it in a 9x13 cake pan. It was wonderful!!

I tried this recipe because a lady I know wanted me to make one for her. I didn't want to make her a whole cake without her knowing if she was going to like it or not, so I made it into cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly and gave some to her and took some to my kids school so the teachers could taste it too. Everyone said it was heaven. My husband (who doesn't like coconut) said he loved it too, and there were plenty of cupcakes leftover for him to take to work. Will definately have to make again because I have people already asking for one. Thanks for the great recipe.

I did not care for this cake. It does have great reviews and there isn't anything wrong with the cake itself but the flavors of it just didn't work with me. I used my own cream cheese frosting since this frosting was to sweet and had an interesting taste to it. I thought that because of all the egg yolks and buttermilk that it would be a hit but it was more of a miss

Just made this cake for a 55th birthday party and it was fabulous.  Everyone raved about it - even my 13 yr old son who claims to hate nuts and coconut!  Just a quick word of advise, when greasing and flouring the cake pans, do not use cooking spray - the results weren't pretty.  I hand grease and flour next time, however, the cakes were salvagable and the icing held the broken pieces together.  Easy, yummy and impressive cake.

This was delicious but really, really sweet.  I made as stated except I didn't add extra coconut into the frosting and am glad I did not.  I think next time I will cut the coconut in the cake back to about 3/4 of a cup.  Just a personal preference.  Other than that, quite tasty and made a nice presentation.  A keeper for sure.

This was AMAZING! I made it for my mom's Birthday and EVERYONE loved it! I did make it a tiny bit different. I used fresh coconut flakes by opening up a coconut, putting it in our juicer and using the "pulp" so it was very fine and dry. I also made the pecans into a puree    so the texture of the cake was just perfect! The frosting was good but what the recipe called for was not enough, but doubling it was to much. I have made a lot of cakes but I have never decorated one before so my picture may not be the best but I was happy with it! Oh and it was still very good the next day when we ate it cold. (It was gone after that.)

This is a great recipe and the only thing different I did was double the icing recipe and I added crushed pecans all along the outside of it. I made this for my mother in law for her birthday last week and I have had to make two more already. They simply love it.

Followed recipe as stated. I have had this same recipe for 30 years but have never made it until now. I always remembered this cake (I only had it the one time) and have wanted to make it but never got around to it. Finally made it for our Italian themed Christmas Family Party! It’s a wonderful cake, you won’t be disappointed if you try this recipe.

My husband can’t have nuts and I found out I didn’t have coconut that was fresh enough so I didn’t add those ingredients. I took it to a potluck and everyone loved it and a few took some home. It made me proud. I loved it too. The flavor was great.

I made it, well almost....it came out of the oven looking awesome but after a few minutes cooling it shrank down to half the height it was out of the oven and was very dense.  I cubed it and made a strawberry banana coconut trifle and that was totally.....AMAZING

The cake was delicious and came out of the pans so nicely! I recommend making double (or 1.5) of the icing if you want to do more than just ice the cake (i.e. pipe the top edge and bottom with a bag). Also, this is the first homemade tiered cake with icing I've ever made--great success!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.    The only thing I changed was I used cake flour.  The cake was moist but lacked flavor.   I'm thankful for the frosting because that is where the flavor was.  I took it to a family dinner and most of the cake was left on the table.

Since joining this site, I’ve turned into a pretty good cook. I usually follow the recipes to the letter and so far it’s worked out wonderfully. This recipe is no exception. This cake is absolutely delicious and looks as good as the taste. Thanks for sharing.

Was excellent. I don't usually make cakes from scratch but I wanted to make this one. For years I looked for the recipe not knowing its name. My hubby and I had been served a piece for our anniversary at a Greek restaurant years ago. I found the name fumbling through an old cookbook but that recipe was incomplete. This one was great and gave more instructions. I love AR magazines App and videos.

I made this for my 5year wedding anniversary. This cake was very good! I gave it 4 stars only because I compared to other Italian creme cake recipes and I changed up some of  the ingredients. I used regular butter and only 4 egg yolks. However, I followed the directions for this recipe pretty much how it said to do it. It came out very moist and delicious. I was pretty proud of myself since it was my first officially homemade cake at least that I can remember. It was also my wedding cake flavor and decided to make it myself on our 5year anniversary. I thought it came out better and more moist than our wedding cake!

For a get together we had, I wanted to get an Italian Cream Cake, but there was only one place that made a good one and it was priced at $60. I decided I was going to bake my own. My wife thought I was crazy because I've never made or baked a cake from scratch before. I followed the recipe to the letter. It came out amazing. My wife was amazed. That was almost a year ago that I made that first cake. I have been requested many times by friends and family over the year to make this cake for events or birthdays.

I have made this cake a few times and it is delicious. It isn't the easiest cake to make. You have to separate the egg whites and you need a really big mixing pool since there is a lot of batter once you have everything in. That being said it is very tasty and everyone loves it. I don't put coconut in the icing and we like it better.

I made the cake to the exact specifications on the recipe. Although everyone loved it, I was disappointed the frosting didnt come out as thick and creamy as most frostings should be. It was runny and quite thin.

I made this simply because I wanted to try it and I've never made a cake from scratch before. I'm not a huge fan of cake and this one was SO GREAT! The cake turned out perfectly, I was able to pull it out of the pans and cut in half without fear of it falling apart, even without the frosting the cake was wonderful, moist and sweet with a little crispness on top. The frosting was quite sweet for me and I would cut out at least one cup of powdered sugar next time I make it....which is tomorrow....because I need more...

I made this for my husband's birthday celebration. I followed the recipe to the letter which is rare for me. After reading all the feed back I couldn't see tampering with what seemed like a perfect recipe. I'm so glad I didn't!!!!!! One suggestion.... We had this at a picnic at the lake in July. I put it in the refrigerator overnight and it held up beautifully. Thank you for the wonderful recipe that everyone from my 9 year old to my 44 year old LOVED!

The only change i made was Mascerpone instead of cream cheese. (Hubby doesn't care for cream cheese frosting). The flavor is awesome, but the cake was dry.

I've never been much of a cake person. I love frosting.  I made this cake and am hooked! And so is my famiy. It's even great without frosting,  but the cream cheese frosting is now my favorite too. The coconut in the cake gives it a little chew and the nuts a little crunch that are fantastic with the moist, soft yet dense cake. This recipe makes great cupcakes too. A bit more work than cake from a box but soooo worth it. I'll be making this for years, thanks so much for sharing :)

This  is a delicious cake will definitely make it again. I made it for a birthday party and it got rave reviews. I live at  5,200 ft. and as with all the chiffon cake recipes I have, this one came out perfectly using standard altitude adjustments. I did take other's suggestions and substituted almond extract for the vanilla.  However, I believe the cake  pictured isn't the actual cake. I am pretty sure the picture is of a two layer 9" cake. The three 8" cakes makes a taller and a little messier to cut cake. Also, I decorate a lot of cakes and should have known you can not pipe cream cheese icing made with margarine in a pastry bag with a star tip.  I think the icing pictured may be a super stabilized whip cream icing  or one like Whole Foods'  Chantilly Cake. I also made 1.5 times the amount of icing and had none leftover. There wasn't much leftover cake either!

I hadn't eaten this cake in at least 30 years when I saw the recipe and decided to make it.  It turned out perfect but I guess my taste buds have changed in time cuz I didn't really care for it.  It's fairly expensive to make as well.  My DH said it is fine to his taste buds!

I made this cake Saturday (a day that reached 108 degrees here in Oklahoma). I got great compliments on it.  The only thing I changed was that I used only about 1/2 the called for amounts of pecans and coconut. It's so good and moist.  The problem I had was that my kitchen was so hot I had difficulty with the icing being a bit thin and my fridge was too full to put the cake in.   The flavors were wonderful and any problems just stemmed from baking in too hot of weather!  Love this cake!

Yum! Tasted just as good (if not better) than bakery/restaurant Italian cream cakes. But beware - Italian cream cakes are very rich and sweet.

This was good, but not the best cake I've evere had. Obviously, anything with this much sugar is going to be tasty. I wish that it had been more savory. May make again, unsure.

This cake was excellent. I made it for my mom's birthday and added coconut to the cake because it's her favorite. I kept the pecans for the outside. I did it in three 8" layer cakes. It didn't rise much so I'll have to try again to see if it was something I did. Other than that, I followed the cake recipe. I did, however, add an extra 1/4 cup of butter to the icing and an extra 2 cups of 10x sugar just to make a little more because we LOVE icing. I iced it then sprinkled coconut on top and pressed ground pecans onto the sides. It was beautiful and delicious. I'll definitely make this again!

Very, very delicious cake!  So yummy.  My family loved it so much and we will have it again for sure.  I even made it gluten free and it was still a big hit!

Fabulous!  I made this for a small get together with some friends.  Since there weren't many of us, I didn't want to make a whole cake, so I made 1/2 the recipe.  The batter all fit in 1 9" round and cooked perfectly.  I cut the round in half and frosted it as a 2 layer cake.  Everyone loved it...and as I had hoped, there were no left overs!

This was very good! I took to an italian dinner with friends and it was great! The only thing I did different was instead of 3 round cakes, I used the handi-foil oblong cake pans. This will make 2 cakes using these pans. worked out good because I took one with me and left one at home. :) will make again.

The flavor was really good, but it came out a little dry, almost too dense.  However, I had a little trouble with the egg whites and didn't fold them in very well.  I will definitely make it again and give it a second chance.  I cooked the pecans up in a skillet before adding them so they would get a nuttier, toasty flavor.  I also toasted some leftover coconut and sprinkled them both on top of the cake and it looked and tasted really good.

I usually start looking for dessert recipes for Thanksgiving in the summer, so that I can try them beforehand, to measure ease of preparation and time efficiency.  This recipe meets both requirements! The cake is moist and flavorful.  The frosting is just right in sweetness, thanks to the cream cheese. I can't wait to serve this to my family and friends!

This recipe was wonderful.  I used it for a 12" wedding cake layer, doing two layers with two batches.  It was moist and yummy and everybody raved.  I didn't change anything except the frosting.  I used a butter cream frosting. Wonderful recipe.

Great Cake.  I used butter in place of margarine & shortening. Turned out very moist.
Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely loved the frosting. I agree it makes plenty. I frosted the cake and put almonds all the way around. No coconut in the cake (not a big fan). I did put it on top and topped the coconut with pecans.(no pecans in the cake) It was a huge hit for a New Years get together I had. I would suggest the cake cook time lessened by 15 min. It was a little dry but I know next time. I am the ultimate Italian Cream Cake fan. Thank you it is now in my recipe book!
