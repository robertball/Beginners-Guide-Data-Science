This soup was definitely worth making. I only used about 1 1/2 lbs ground chuck (all I had). I used the milk called for and added another cup of milk and about 1-2 cups of water. The texture was very smooth and creamy. I also added a couple teaspoons of dried dill. Not sure why you "slice" the potatoes but if I make again I would cut into cubes. When the soup was done I ended up "breaking" up the potatoes with my wooden spoon. Be careful during the first 30 minutes of cooking (higher heat). It will boil over and make a mess. But, delicious soup. Made it last night and this morning my boyfriend commented again how good it was. Served it with a salad. Also, we had lots of left overs which will probably be even better when re-heated.

I added a LOT more liquid to this recipe, in the form of a large can of tomato sauce and another can of water, because that's what I had on hand.  Otherwise, it would have been more like a casserole.  The soup was good-- a bit on the mild side, which is the way my kids like it.  This is a good way to sneak some cabbage into people who say they hate cabbage.  :-D

something was missing.  No seasonings at all. No salt. I thought too bland.

Cut the recipe down to two servings and chose to leave out the meat. Added some seasonings and it was delicious and very filling. Thank you!

My rating reflects making this slightly modified as follows: no tomato soup or water - instead adding: large can of crushed tomatoes, small can of tomato sauce, ~2 cups of beef broth & some paprika.

A great recipe! I took out the cabbage (not very German, but my husband doesn't do cabbage), added some paprika and it was very good indeed.

This is a great base recipe. I followed the directions as written other than saut√©ing my onion with the beef. Since there is no spices added, I added what  I felt was appropriate for the recipe. I used dill, salt, pepper, thyme, bay leaves and vinegar (I had some German vinegar that I got at a German restaurant, kind of sweet and herby). In addition, I used one can of diced tomatoes and increased the liquid to bring the soup up to the consistency I like (still thick but with some liquid). I also added some better than bouillon beef base to amp up the flavor. Overall, it was delicious with the additions.

I made this soup knowing I don't like cabbage but I am trying to eat healthier so I thought I would try again.
I stuck to the recipe mostly but added little pepper and paprika but thought it was too sweet tasting and not to my liking. 
I will not make again or maybe if I did then I would delete the cabbage.

Very mice soup! Instead of canned tomato condensed soups, I sainted in olive oil then simmered for about an hour seven ripe tomatoes. I let this cool then used an immersion hand blender to blend the whole tomatoes, then used this in place of the canned stuff. I thought the soup was a tad bland so I added some splashes of Worcestershire sauce and a little extra salt. Overall tasty and my German father-in-law and husband enjoyed!

I made this soup and halved the recipe.  I really thought it was easy to make and tasted good.  Next time I make the half recipe I will use three cans of tomato soup instead of two because I think I would enjoy a little stronger tomato flavor

This soup has a weird color to it. It tasted good, but it was nothing spectacular. My 14 year old son loved it, but my husband just said it was okay. I had to force my 17 year old to try it, and my 9 year old had no comment which is unusual.
