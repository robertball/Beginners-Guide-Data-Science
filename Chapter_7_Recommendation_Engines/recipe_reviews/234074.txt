Thick & Savory Chili Haiku: "This was good not great. Ketchup & sugar - too sweet. But I liked thickness." The consistency of this chili was perfect but the taste didn't really wow us. Between the 15 oz. tomato sauce and the 1 c. of ketchup it was heavy on the tomato taste and that coupled w/ the overall sweetness just put it into a no-repeat-stack. I love trying out different chili recipes and I can only imagine that this one would definitely appeal to many people who prefer that touch of sweetness but for us it just wasn't a success.
