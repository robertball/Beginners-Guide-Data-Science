I used this recipe for a cake filling. Instead of pineapple I used strawberries - It was great! The entire family loved it. After the cake was gone we used some of the extra strawberries and dipped them in some of the left over filling - that was great too!!!!

I made my first cake ever with this as a filling, and the cake was gone not long after the candles were blown out! I made a two layer 9" white cake, and this filling was really enough to make two cakes this size. Not too sweet, the pineapple is not strong at all, and a very nice fluffy touch to any cake!

Very tastey and easy, but just a little too liquidy. I'd reduce the milk by 1/4 c or so next time.

Delicious! I took other reviewer advice and used 1/2 cup milk in the pudding to make it thicker and I made that first and set aside. I then beat the cream cheese, added in the pineapple with a little juice, then added in the pudding mixture-once mixed I folded in the cool whip and this helped to keep it light and fluffy. I refrigerated it overnight and frosted my pineapple mud cake from this site in the morning before I left for work. Everyone loved it. This topping made the whole thing so creamy but not overpowering in sweetness. Loved It!

This is so easy to make, and I was able to substitute 1/2 coconut milk and coconut cream pudding mix.  Turned out wonderful for my coconut cake.  Will definitely hang on to this for a good base frosting.

This is a great topping!!  Very light, and not too sweet.  Comparable to whipped topping at bakeries.  I combined pineapples, strawberries and bananas in it to fill my cake with a 'fruit basket' filling.  Great as just an 'icing' as well!!  Kudos!!

I love it! Very light tasting and not too sweet. I used it for cake filling. I omitted the pineapple because I didn't have any. My husband put what I didn't use in the fridge because he liked it so much. We will use the remainder as a fruit dip for my daughters birthday party tomorrow.

This was amazing.  I wanted to try it with the pineapple but when I got into my cabinet, I only had choc pudding.  I omitted the pineapple and did less milk like the reviews suggested.  It was delicious!

Very yummy and light.  From other reviews I used only 3/4 cup of milk.  I also didn't put in the pineapple because my husband doesn't like pineapple.  Next time I think I will try chocolate pudding mix. :)
