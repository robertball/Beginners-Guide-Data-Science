These are so good! I have made them several times and everyone loves them. I use apple pie filling the most with this. They are good either for breakfast or as a dessert. Yummy!!

The flavor is very good, but I did not like the way the crescent dough pastry turned out. Not flaky, but somewhat rubbery in texture. I will make this again but use puff pastry next time. ****AN update - 1st time I used the store brand crescent rolls, which I said were rubbery. I have made them a second time using the Pillsbury Crescent Rolls. This is a definite 5+ star rating. Thanks

Excellent!  I used a little whipping cream instead of milk for the glaze and added a little vanilla extract (wanted to add almond, but was out) and scattered sliced almonds all over the top and it just set it off perfectly!  Took it to an Easter breakfast and got tons of compliments!

Delicious!!  Next time I will definitely pre-bake the bottom crust for a few minutes b/c it was definitely doughy.

Delicious! Although I did try to make it a bit healthier. Pillsburty now sells whole grain crescent rolls so I used though. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar, regular sugar too, half the cream cheese and half the vanilla.  Also the icing was wayyyyy too watery

Verry good, not too sweet.  If you make this ahead of time, dont glaze it until your ready to eat.

Nice flavor.  However, even though I partially precooking the bottom layer, the pastry layers were soft and became gummy.  Next time, I would use puff pastry.  Cheese layer was much thicker then the fruit (unlike the picture), even though I used a 24 ounce can.  I will either use two cans of fruit or less cheese.  Top frosting was WAY to thin.
