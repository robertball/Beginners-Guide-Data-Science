This is excellent, but very rich. I use double the pasta for the same amount of sauce, and usually use thin spaghetti instead of fettuccine. The cheese is Locatelli (not Locatella), which is Pecorino Romano. I have also made it using regular sausage rather than Italian sausage. I should also add that I now make the sauce in the microwave, just keeping an eye on it until it starts to boil. Comes out fine and saves a lot of time.

I only gave this recipe 4 stars after reading the reviews and realizing how rich the sauce would be.  After making a few changes, it now rates *5* (according to the family).  Instead of 1 cup heavy cream, I used 1/2 cup of 2% milk and 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  I also used only 1/4 cup of butter.  (I made these changes for 2 reasons, one to reduce calories and the other to lighten the richness of the sauce). This turned out very creamy and light, but not heavy and rich!! No leftovers at my house.  Will definately make again

great stuff... I couldn't find that particular cheese so I used a mix of romano, parmesan, and asiago cheeses... the cheese didn't really melt into the sauce but it still worked great for me... wonderful taste... i used cheese tortilini... everyone enjoyed it...

Once I read that Locatella (Locatelli) is really Pecorino Romano, this was a snap, and unbelievably delicious.  I used light cream instead of heavy whipping cream, and mixed in a bit of Parmesan with the Pecorino Romano.  I also cooked some red pepper in with the sausage, and added some chopped asparagus to the pasta while it was cooking.  Oh, and then I added some scallions in with the parsley, so I changed it up a bit but made it a bit healthier with the veggies.  It was SOOOOO... absolutely delicious it's getting added to my "guest dinners" list!

Delcious.  Used romano cheese with a dash of parmesan and penne pasta (what I had on hand).  Also I used spicy italian sausage - it was great, will always make this way.  Took me about 20 minutes from start to finish and tasted great.  Thanks!

Um. I don't know about this.  It was ok I guess, I sauteed some garlic with the sausage and then  after tasting it I wound up adding parm and romano cheese. That was just personal prefrence,  I like really bold flavors. I think it was the sausage that I wasn't fond of, strange texture maybe? I guess I am sticking with my normal recipe and using grilled chicken though.  Thank you for the recipe anyway, it worked when I had completely forgotten to marinate chicken lol =)

Loved this recipe! Used Hot Italian Sausage for a little added kick. Next time will make two batches. One spicy and one using mild. Was Great!

I altered the recipe quite a bit so my review reflects the actual outcome.  The texture of sausage removed from the casing sounded like it would be odd to me so I sliced the sausage instead.  I also added garlic to the Alfredo sauce and used Parmesan for the cheese.  I added freshly ground white pepper too.  Hubby doesn't care for Alfredo and gobbled this up!

This was good but would have been bland without the parsley.  Also would probably make this again with chicken rather than sausage.

I've never bought fancy cheeses from the fancy cheese bin before, but lo and behold I found a wedge Pecorino Romano right on top. I couldn't resist tasting it while shredding.. oh yeah: delicious! This was a very good recipe. In fact, its really a very new kind of flavor in my home. My wife said it had a "restaurant" quality flavor. I agree. I used rigatoni since I just made a fettuccini dinner recently, and thickened with a little corn starch. The sauce and sweet Italian sausage were perfect with one another. I increased the serving size because I knew my kids would want some next visit.

This is a wonderful recipe! The flavor is excellent and the sauce comes together easily without clumping or separating. There is no reason to add cornstarch, or make any alterations except for personal taste. The sauce is a great consistency as is. I made this exactly as specified, and it is a new family favorite.

I used Locatelli, as called for in the recipe. Thank you so much, ANGCHICK, for introducing me to this wonderfully flavored cheese! This recipe would not be nearly so good with Parmesan, Romano, or similar substitute cheese. Locatelli has a full-bodied flavor the other cheeses lack. I later purchased another brand of pecorino romano, and in side by side taste comparison, while it was good as well, it was not as good as the Locatelli, in my opinion.

I would not change a thing about this recipe.

Very easy to make! I had to do a few substitutions as I didn't have Locatella cheese and fresh parsley but still turned out great.

Suprisingly it was very nice. I did however make a few changes, these are: i used parmesan cheese, added about a tsp of chicken stock powder and just used the good old fashioned sanga that you would put on the bbq. Wouldnt have it all the time due to its fat content but yes it was very tasty!
