A fun appetizer for anytime! Except for the cream cheese mixture, I added each ingredient in rows parallel to the direction I was rolling them up. (see picture I added)I think it makes a cleaner appearance after cutting them. Hope that makes sense. Roll them very snug to eliminate gaps  between the ingredients and make sure your knife is sharp so you don't tear the tortilla when you slice them.

If the chiles are too spicy for you (as they are for me), mix the cream cheese instead with taco seasoning (chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder).

I also warmed the refried beans before putting them on the tortilla.

Excellent recipe!

Great recipe! I only used flour tortillas and added fresh mango with the avocado. I blended a little sour cream with the cream cheese and added some jalape√±o cilantro dip seasoning to the mixture because it's what I had and I also didn't use the chipotle. A mango pico de gallo was a refreshing touch. Overall my family loved this for an appetizer and it was super simple to make!

We really enjoyed this "sushi." I omitted the chipotle peppers are we are not fans and used wheat tortillas (seemed wasteful to buy multiple packs of tortillas just for different colored tortillas. Great served sliced or as a wrap.

These were easy and make a great appetizer or light lunch!  Surprisingly, my grocery store didn't have a good selection of flavored tortillas, but I found some cheddar jalapeno tortillas and that gave this recipe a nice kick of flavor! I also had to substitute regular refried beans for the black beans, but this was still a tasty snack!

Dead easy! I skip cilantro because I don't care for it, but otherwise a great party recipe. Easy to alter the ingredients for more fun. Yum! Yum! All gone!

Only a 3 because------This is misleading. But tasty. It's a tortilla roll-up.  Sushi translates to "marinated rice".  There's no rice involved. Had the Avocado Council done some research, they'd know that.

These were delicious!  The spiciness was subtle and far from overpowering.  They were a creamy and tasty snack!  I just used plain flour tortillas, not one flour, one tomato, and one spinach.

These also taste great with a little bit of sour cream put on right before being eaten.

Sliced the avocado rather than diced it.  They were a great hit at a family 4th of July party.

Oh dear! I did something really wrong somehow. They looked good after making, but when I took them out of the fridge a couple hours later to cut up and serve, they were "wet" looking. The tortilla itself had become soft and gooey.  I think they have to be eaten right away or the tortilla is no longer crisp and appetizing.

Very easy and a hit at a friend's bbq. You can easily customize this. I added some leftover Mexican rice along with the other ingredients.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written and it turned out mushy, messy, and pretty awful tasting. Won't make again but I like the idea/concept.

I made this and it was delicious.  I did not make it as appetizers, but made 4  spinach wraps and served them that way.  My husband loved them!  I used fat free cream cheese. I will definitely make this again!

It was a hit for a club meeting.  The only change I made was just using adobo sauce in the cream cheese.  I was afraid some people would not like the heat of the chipotle peppers.  By the way, I tripled the recipe.  It was all gone.

We ate this as the main course, and it was pretty good.  I had a hard time rolling it and making it look as good as the photo.  This is a nice change from our usual fare.
