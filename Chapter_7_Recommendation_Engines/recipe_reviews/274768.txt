I can get used to this if all meatless meals are this good. Added some cilantro last couple of minutes of cooking was great.

This was delicious.  The fresh corn really made a difference.  The only change I made was to add some freshly roasted Hatch chilies, since they are in season.  We used toppings of sour cream, avocados, cilantro, and salsa.
