About 4 cups of oats makes 2 cups of oat flour FWIW. I added 1/3 of cup of molasses and added another teaspoon of ginger because I love ginger. I also added some vanilla and a dash of nutmeg and cloves. 15 minutes worked perfect. The cookies turned out perfectly. Thanks for the share.

I hate to give this such a bad rating, but this recipe just did not work for me. I followed it exactly, and ended up with a lace cookie that tasted only of sugar. The description describes these as being thin and crunchy, but they are waaayy thin. They spread out massively while baking, so I could only do 6 on a cookie sheet at a time--and if they were baked more than 12 minutes, they tasted burnt. I was hopeful that they'd taste ok even after spreading out so bad, but the spices and molasses flavor gets lost in all the sugar taste. I don't think I'll make these again. Sorry.
