Tasty!!! I upped the old bay to 1 Tbsp in the main mixture, and in the topping I doubled the butter and added a half cup of seasoned breadcrumbs and shredded cheddar to the topping. Could use about 30 minutes to get nice and crispy/melty in the topping.

I used the suggestions made by another reviewer. I increased Old Bay and butter and added cheese and bread crumbs to the topping. It was the best crab dip ever!
