Very tasty but it i would recommend dipping it only once in the batter twice is too much.

I hate to write a negative review, but I didn't care for this recipe.  I thought the curry powder was strange, but used it anyway.  Luckily I only fried one shrimp to taste.  I rinsed the rest and we ate shrimp cocktail for dinner.

This was excellent.  The shrimp came out slightly sweet (though not too much) and delicious.  We made a sauce for it, I highly recommend it:  combine 10 oz of orange marmalade, 3 Tbls prepared horseradish and 3 Tbls of mustard (this makes A LOT though, so you may want to scale it down).  They pair excellently together!
