Hands down the tastiest, easiest mac and cheese recipe ...  I made this for X-mas and everyone loved loved loved it.  the fried onions are a special treat.  lots of cheese and lots of sauce.  I adjusted it for 15 people using the conversion chart and it worked well.  I highly recommend this recipe if you want cheesy, creamy  not box mac and cheese...comfort food to the maxi-mo!

I've made this recipe so many times. It used to be in a Campbell's recipe book my mom had.  My sins won't eat any other mac and cheese. It's the best!

Enjoyed this.  Mine came out more like a casserole though than strictly mac and cheese.  I think that's because of the soup.  I used cream of chicken just bc that's what I had.  I also threw in a handful of fresh spinach and a couple dashes of hot sauce.  I also used some fresh mozz along with the cheddar, again bc that's just what I had.  I really enjoyed it and look forward to the leftovers - thanks!

FINALLY!  A go-to mac 'n cheese recipe that tastes like the decadent version served in restaurants!  This was amazing and had the creamy texture that melts in your mouth.  My only change was to use large elbow mac and cavatappi noodles (what I had on hand because I prefer these for mac 'n cheese), and to leave off the onions per personal preference.   I also threw in andoiulle sausage to use it up, though this would be great without it.

made it as the recipe called, but we kind of thought it needed a bit more cheese; and we used smoked cheddar cheese versus regular...but it is a keeper!

a staple comfort food, easy to customize.
add a small diced onion and a can of tuna. milk is optional.
Chopped olives make a nice change.
mix it all in baking dish, no need to dirty a bowl.
if you don't have/like the fried onions, topped with crushed crackers and cheese put on about half way through.
If using chopped onion, bake until onion is done - maybe 45 minutes.

I have tried several different homemade Mac and Cheese recipes.  This is one of the easiest to make.  Some take many ingredients, some turn out pasty and blah.  This one took only a few ingredients and had a good flavor.  I used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom because my son doesn't like mushrooms.  I cooked three cup of macaroni, but didn't use it all.  I mixed the soup and cheese in my 2 qt. casserole dish and added macaroni until the dish was full.  Not all the macaroni would fit and I think it might have turned out a bit dry if I had added it all.  I think 2 generous cups would be enough for a 2 qt casserole dish.  The recipe did not say what size dish to use.  I thought the flavor was quite good considering the recipe doesn't call for much in the way of seasoning.  We added salt at the table to our individual taste.  The crispy onions on top are a great addition which we all enjoyed. I will make this again.
