I come from a long line of cookie bakers, and this was a very good recipe! I made a few revisions myself, such as blending all ingredients in a glass bowl with a wooden spoon (I'm old school). I also used 1 c. butter-flavored shortening instead of butter/ shortening combo - it helps the cookies set without spreading too much. I also baked for 10 minutes and let rest on the cookie sheet (lined with aluminum foil, not greased) for an additional minute.  The cookies were perfect, and my brother-in-law in Iraq absolutely LOVED them.

I thought these cookies were very good. I lightly greased one cookie sheet and not the other and there was no difference. The cookies on the ungreased sheet did not stick. Loved 'em.

I followed the recipe with two exceptions:  I added a 10 oz. bag of white chocolate chips (almost 2 cups) and only added 5 oz. macadamia nuts.  I baked for 9 minutes and they came out perfect!  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

This cookie is outstanding!  I baked them for a little less than the time suggested because I love chewy cookies :)  I will definitely save this recipe!

These cookies have far too much flour in them, when i made them up, 2 cups of flour to only 1 cup of chips is too much and it was obvious in tasting them.

I'd also suggest cutting back on the butter or shortening.. although I didn't have a problem with spreading, grease seeped out as the cookies were cooking, which caused some of the edges to be slightly "crispy" and burnt, even with decreased cooking time. Otherwise, the cookie was good; soft and chewy.

This one would be in the gourmet cookie category.  My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't make enough cookies.  Admittedly, I make a thick cookie, but only ended up with about thirty.  This is one of my favorite cookies and this recipe does perfect justice to my best recollections of Macadamia nut cookies.  You can't go wrong with this one!

OMG - absoluely YUMMY cookie!  I could have eaten a dozen all by myself.  I increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons (my philosophy in life - you can never have too much vanilla, and you can never have too much cinnamon!)  and I used half butter, half margerine instead of shortening.  I used a whole package of white chocolate chips, which is 1 1/2 cups.   I used macadamia nuts but don't see why walnuts wouldn't work too.  Be careful not to overcook - they get dark around the edges really quickly.  I'm at high altitude, which might have affected the bake time.  This is a cookie that will definitely fill grandma's cookie jar when the little ones come to visit.  Thank you, Jamie for a wonderful recipe!

I have made these for the second time and my husband says they get better each time.  Since I love to experiment, I have made only minor additions.  I add few extra nuts and chips.  Also leave in frig about 1-hour.  Also add 1-tsp. almond flavoring.  My oven requires about 15-minutes.  These cookies will be added as one of "our" favorites.  Thanks again for a "winner"

Excellent recipe! Just made these this morning with my kids. Only changes I made were I used a little less macadamia nuts and a little more white chocolate chips. I also refrigerated the dough for about 10 min while I waited for the oven to preheat and did not grease the baking sheet. I cooked them for 9 min and took them out right when the edges started to turn brown. They looked underdone but when they cooled, they were PERFECT!   Had some friends over and they adored them, asking for a third and fourth cookie. I was even told by one friend that it was the best cookie he'd ever had!

Delicious!  I made a few changes:  I used a whole cup of butter instead of half shortening.  I also added a teaspoon of almond extract.  For me, this is really key in a good white choc macadamia cookie.  Highly recommend adding the almond extract!

I made these today.  I didn't have to grease the cookie sheets after the first batch which I did.  The only thing different I did was add 2 tsp vanilla and cut the cooking to 9 minutes after 10 for the first batch.  Very very good.  Will use this recipe as staple recipe for chip cookies, which I think any chips and nuts will work.

Just what I was looking for for the Holidays! My entire family absolutely LOVED these cookies! Even my sister, whom dispises nuts, indulged in them! I only had 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts for this recipe, and believe me that was plenty! Each cookie had enough nuts to compliment the white morsels. Also I made sure they only stayed in the oven 10 minutes... as I see they are easily over-baked in some of these pictures. (very easy thing to do) This recipe is one I will be making every year, for holidays as well as just for snacks!

These are fantastic. No need to change a thing about the recipe. Watch them very carefully while baking ... just a light golden brown is all that's needed for these babies to be ever slightly crunchy tops and redic most in the centers.

I made these the other day to take to my inlaws house because my brother in-law passed away.  I have NEVER ever received more oohs and ahhs and OMG'S and wide eyes of love after taking one bite of these.  I vow to make these a LOT more.  Thank you so much for sharing.  People literally from ages 8-80 ate these and cherished every bite.  These  delicious cookies gave many sorrowful people moments of joy...and as a baker, there is no better compliment than that!

These cookies are absolutely delicious!! I did add 1/2 more tsp of vanilla (2 tsp), a full bag of white chocolate chips (2 cups) and only had a 2oz bag of nuts, but I chopped them into smaller pieces. PERFECT!

Amazing cookies! I used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening and they still turned out delicious! Also, they took about 13 mins to bake instead of the 10 suggested, but that could just be because my oven is old. Wonderful recipe!

These turned out very yummy. I added more nuts and white chips than the recipe called for since I like a more chunky cookie. Also, I only baked for the minimum time (10 min) to make sure they stayed soft.

what a delicious cookie! i did make a few alterations though, i used 2/3c splenda white sugar, and then 2/3c of brown sugar. i found that the nuts already had enough salt on them so i omitted the salt as well. other than that they perfectly rose to a golden brown, thanks for the great recipe!

Over all pretty good.  Be careful not to over bake them, as they will (as with any cookie) will get hard and crunchy. Will make again

These cookies were amazing! I used white chocolate chips because that's what I had. I bake all my cookies on parchment paper, so I didn't use a greased cookie sheet. My husband likes his cookies more on the crispy side so I baked them until the edges became brown, about 14 minutes. They came out perfect. My husband said these are his new favorite cookies and believe me, he is a cookie expert!

These were delicious! The only thing I did differently was to add fewer macadamia nuts...4 oz instead of 7.  Would definitely made these again.

Don't change a thing, this recipe is fantastic! I always get compliments and there are never leftovers. Everyone wants my recipe, but I think I'll keep this one a secret ;)

Absolutely the best!  Perfectly browned and chewey - didn't spread at all and looked like they could have come from a bakery at 3.99/dozen!  Definitely making these a staple in my house from now on. Thanks much!

this is a great recipe. taste just like store bought! i used my tablespoon sized scoop and got nearly 4 dozen cookies. the only issue i have is that the dough itself was pretty crumbly and i can't decide what to add to make it more "doughy". any suggestions?

So I have a mixed review for this recipe. On the one hand they tasted like heaven....literally! Crunchy outside and melt in your mouth delicious baked cookie on the inside. 10 out of 10 for the taste. However, I feel this recipe is missing some more baking soda or perhaps some baking powder as all of my cookies fell flatter than pancakes! I'm definately keeping the recipe for the future but will remember to try about 1/4 ts of baking powder next time to keep them fluffy. Or maybe just less shortening......

Ok I love these cooking! The are soft, and have the crunch of the nuts! It is excellent. My hubby doenst eat Macadamia nuts, so I split the dough in half and put semi sweet chocolate chips in it to make ordinary chocolate chip cookies... He said they are the best I've ever made! Woot!

These are wonderful!  12 minutes to the perfect white chocolate macadamia nut cookies!  I made the recipe as is except I just dumped the whole bag of white chocolate chips in.  My husband, who usually has amazing self control when it comes to cookies, inhaled the first 2 dozen that came out of the oven.  
The recipe says that it yields 3 dozen cookies, but I got 7 dozen out of it.  
The cookies will look....not quite done, let them sit for a bit & then once the next batch of cookies come out of the oven, THEN switch them to a wire rack to cool.  they lets them set up enough, but not overcook.  Anything over 12 minutes made my cookies on the crispy side.  not burnt, just crispy.  Enjoy!

These are so good! I had a ton of white chocolate chips in my pantry to use up and I've been wanting a recipe for these cookies for years and never tried to make them till now, so glad I stumbled upon this recipe! tastes similiar to the ones at subway which I can never resist when I go to get a sandwich! I didn't have macadamia nuts on hand but still good without them, can't wait to try it with!

This is one of my favorite cookies. I used this recipe to make them for the first time and I absolutely love it. I can't stop eating them. I did use slightly more than the cup of white choc. chips. I might use closer to 3/4 cup of white sugar next time to cut the sweet down a tad. Other than that, this recipe was perfect and I'm sure I'll be making these again.

Exactly what we were looking for in a cookie recipe featuring macadamia nuts.  Delicious!  Had to cook a bit longer than specified... but I probably made them larger, too.  :)

The taste was good, used a medium ice cream scoop to make them uniform.  But, not as chewy as I like.  Other than that, easy to make.

Great cookie recipe..I am not much of a fan of White Choc. Mac cookies, but the fans I made them for...LOVED them. Said they were the best! I made some small modifications that are similar to other recipes on this site... I cut down on brown sugar slightly (very sweet cookies to begin with). I used a tsp of Vanilla and 1/4 tsp of almond extract and I added a bit more flour to the second half of the batter before I baked and it was fine. Baked for 11 min..and perfect..chewy cookies! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe! I didn't have white chocolate chips so just chopped the chocolate bar instead. Also, added Walnuts instead of Macademia nuts since these are not very easily available in India. Cookies turned out very good...loved by all! definitely will bake more of them.

Wonderful!  I was concerned because everyone was either 5 stars or 1 star....but they are NOT too floury.  I followed the recipe to a T and they came out perfectly!  They aren't crumbly or floury tasting as some reviewers state.  Just measure your flour carefully, and don't put in more chips or nuts than the recipe calls for and they'll be lovely!  OH and DO NOT overbake!  Cookies are done when the edges start to brown, even if the middle looks a little less done.  Good luck, this recipe is great...keep trying! :-)

Cookies are my specialty. The cookies turned out flat as a pancake, and were a greasy mess. I have never seen anything like it. I suggest moving on to a different recipe if these are the cookies you want to make.

I made it as-is last year, and they turned out fabulous!! After reading some reviews this year, I decided to change it up a bit. I added about 1/8c LESS flour, a few extra chips (just my liking), and subbed 1/8c white sugar for 1/8c extra brown sugar to make them chewier. I always add an extra splash of vanilla too. They turned out wonderful. 10 minutes in the oven and they were exactly perfect. Not too brown, but just enough to be done and golden. If you like your cookies crispier, sub a little white sugar for some of the brown and let them go for about 12 minutes instead of 10. This is by far the best recipe I have found for some of the best cookies ever.

I love Subway's cookies and these are soft and delicious like them! Great Recipe! I used 1/2 crisco and 1/2 butter, a little more chips, and a little less nuts.

Very good recipe! I previously made the version III and I do have to say that this version: using shortening and butter made them hold their shape a bit better and added a nice crispness around the edge.  I only made a couple minor modifications. I added 1/2 tsp lemon extract..I felt it gave it a nice hint of added flavour. I also used chocolate chunks (Callabeaut) instead of chocolate chips, for a bit more white chocolate flavour. As well, I used dark brown sugar, while not specified..I love using dark brown sugar (not demerara) as it gives baking a nice rich flavour.

My favorite recipe!  It's the base cookie recipe I use for my cookies  I just vary the chips and nuts used!  Everyone raves when I bake these cookies. I utilize a really good chocolate chip for special occasions.  But I made these for holiday gifts in a jar with instructions to add the wet ingredients.  The only issue which I will need to figure out is the brown sugar packs super tight in the jar - although the layers are "pretty" I may mix the two sugars the next time to ease removal from the jar.  Oh - but I did not place the nuts in the jar - 1 they can go rancid quickly and 2 they will not fit!

My kids and I made these cookies last night. They turned out great. I didn't have quite as many nuts as the recipe called for, but they're fine. I may add more next time.  The dough seemed a little sticky at first so I added a little more flour.  We will definitely make these again.

Omigosh, so good! This is the third white chocolate macadamia nut cookie recipe I've tried...and, I'm keeping this one! These cookies are amazing. I take mine out a minute or two earlier so they're a bit more chewy. Sooo good, that's all I can say.

I've never made these cookies before and they turned out delicious! I did use 3/4 tsp vanilla and 3/4 tsp almond extract and only 6 oz. of macadamia nuts. When cooked for 8 1/2 min the cookies were crunchy on the outside edges and chewy in the middle.

These were quick and easy to make, the only thing that I changed the second time around was the amount of time in the oven. 10 minutes made them crunchy but for my second batch I turned off the oven and opened the oven door at 7.5 minutes. they were definitely much softer after cooling than the first. This batch made me 30 2" cookies.

These are absolutely delicious.  I was looking for a recipe that tasted very similar to the ones from Subway, and these are identical, if not better.  The key for me was to bake them only for 8 minutes; they turned out nice and soft.  My favorite cookie ever.

Perfect!  My daughter and I love white chocolate and macadamia nut cookies and wanted to make some from scratch.  We both agree that these are the best we have tasted!

I put in half of the nuts that the recipe called for, only due to the outrageous price, but they were still delicious!!

Used Kailua instead of vanilla but I do that to most of my recipes anyway.

I made this recipe today but used walnuts instead of macadamia nuts.   They turned out delicious!  Made 4 dozen cookies.

This is a very good recipe.   I used only white chocolate chips (husband's preference)  and they were still delicious.   Following other reviewer's advice, I added about a quarter cup more flour and I was careful not to let the butter soften TOO much.  The cookies were soft and chewy,  but not falling apart.    I also used only 1 teaspoon of  vanilla extract and ADDED 1/2 teaspoon of rum extract.   Lastly, I added about a 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips.   I will make these again.

My family and I absolutely love this cookie recipe. I sift the flour, baking soda and salt like I would for pancakes, but kept everything else the same. I made them initially for my team at work, and ended up having to make another batch because we ate almost all of them! (LOL)

These are the best cookies EVER!!! I’m not a huge white chocolate fan, but these are definitely an exception and something different than traditional cookies. My friends request these often. They also freeze well.

An instant hit with the whole family. I added a cup of coconut and when cooled made them into ice cream sandwiches for dessert. Next time going to use earlier review of 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. Blessings!

Blizzard Jonas inspired baking at my home.  My 11 yr old Boy Scout made these as part of his Cooking Merit badge. Key things are they should cool 2 minutes on the rack before removing from cookie sheet. They will crumble otherwise. Also, I refuse to use shortening and used coconut oil instead. Take care when chopping whole macadamia nuts, they crumble easily. They were delectable and easy to make.

Excellent recipe! I make these for my husband's co-workers and the orders keep coming in!  I add the nuts when I scoop the cookies, otherwise it is hard to get them evenly distributed. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe. Made a batch, came out perfect. Baked until edges were light brown, about 9 min. Let them finish on cookie sheet. Did not grease pan, parchment paper worked wonders. Was able to grab of paper.

This is an excellent recipe! I followed it exactly, but doubled it to take some to work as a treat for my coworkers. My rounded teaspoonfuls baked at precisely eleven minutes, with one minute "rest" on the cookie sheet after removing from the oven. Be careful not to overcook, these are best with just a slight crunch around the edges and a chewy, soft middle. The only "tweak" I have for the recipe as written is: you do not have to ever grease a cookie sheet when baking cookies; they already have such a high fat content it is not necessary and would just be over-kill. Other than that, great recipe Jamie!! I will definitely use this again and again.

Great recipe! This was the first time I've made these so I don't have much to compare it to but the cookies were delicious. Followed the recipe except I used half a bag of white chocolate chips instead of a half cup. I was able to get 39 cookies out of the recipe as it was, I'll definitely double it next time. I baked them for 10 minutes and they were golden brown but still soft.

This is the cookie I've been craving! I made it exactly as the recipe said, and turned out 36 
3 1/2 - 4 inch cookies. My hubby, who isn't a huge fan of cookies gave this rave reviews. Definitely going into my Keeper BOX. Thanks for a wonderful cookie! I will never buy those "gourmet" cookies again!

I love this recipe! I had bought macadamia nuts on sale and some white chips but had no idea how to make these cookies and only hoped I could find a good recipe. I did! The cookies were so soft and delicious.

I replaced a lot of the ingredients.  1) I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose  2) I used olive oil and sea salt instead of butter and shortening  3) I used organic maple syrup and raw turbinado sugar instead of brown and white sugar.  4) I used this white chocolate from whole foods that I broke into chunks  5) I omitted macadamian nuts     At first it did not come out well because I added too much sea salt then I diluted it with some whole wheat flour and it was pretty good.  I saved the dough in my freezer so I could make it for future use.

Need to really watch the bake time on these and adjust according to your oven. 1 minute too long and they're dry and dark.  My husband, however, enjoyed them enough to ask me to bake them again.

I have made MANY batches of cookies and I have to say these are delicious. I changed two things that were very minor which was using 1 cup of butter and no shortening (I did not have any on hand) and  i used only 6 oz of Macadamia nuts which worked out great! thanks for the recipe. will use again!

These were really good and chewy.  I do not have white chocolate (or any other kind) chips where I live, so I chopped up a white chocolate bar.  This causes the chocolate to melt a bit more into the cookie dough, but they were still very tasty!

Gee I made these this afternoon and they are delish!!. As I now review the recipe I notice that I forgot the shortening. I also added all the little bits of nuts and chips I had so I ended uo with macadamia nuts, pecans, white chocolate chunks from a white chocolate bar, skor pieces and chocolate chips. I think I will do it this way from now on but I will try to remember the shortening LOL although they were fine without, no spreading and not too floury.

These cookies were very easy to make and delicious.  I gave them as part of my care packages during Christmas and they were a big hit.  I will definately make them again.  I changed the white chocolate chips to white chocolate chunks....Mmmm Mmmm good!

Great recipe - I baked for 7 min's tops and took them right off the pan to the counter so they stay nice and chewey. If they are still too chewy after they cool just put them in the fridge! The smaller the cookie size the better they cook when you make them chewy. Little tip -no charge!

Very good! I'm glad I chose this recipe amongst the other white macadamia nut cookies =] 10 minutes was the perfect time in the oven, and then another 2 minutes of rest on the stove before transferring to paper grocery bags covered in paper towels [helps absorb some of the grease, and these have plentyyy to spare] Was exactly what I was looking for, and while I'm notorious for adding extra things here and subtracting things there, this recipe needs no modifications. Perfect as is.

Buy Macadamia nuts when they are on sale as they can be relatively expensive. This cookie is a real treat and worth "making and taking" when you want something extraordinary. Guys love it!

Great cookie! I used slightly more white chocolate and butter flavored shortening. They have a great flavor and stayed puffy which we prefer over the traditional flat mac nut cookie. My 3 yr old loves them and my husband can't seem to get enough of them! A keeper for my recipe box..

This recipe made great cookies.  I added toffee bits and they made the cookies to die for.  Next time i might add another egg.  The dough didn't hold together very well with just one egg.

Cookies were great...maybe too sweet. I bake then for 12 minutes for crunchier cookies. The recipe is great even when I converted for 24 servings insted of the 18 or 36 that original recipe suggest. THANKS SO MUCH. I will bake again.

I dunno. It may just be me, in fact it probably is, but mine came out very flat and crunchy. I'll probably try this recipe again, but I'm definitely changing a few things. :/

Great cookie!  I used double the white chocolate chips and hazelnuts (thought they were macadamia until they came out of the freezer) and, though very sweet, they turned out well.

Good recipe, but it spreads out too much, so it was literally flat and I needed to cook it longer than suggested.  I think you may have to reduce the butter and shortening.
