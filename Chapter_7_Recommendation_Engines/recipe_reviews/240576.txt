I decided to make this recipe since it was faceless and didn't have a review yet. I've made Puppy Chow numerous time and had all of the main ingredients and gave this recipe a go. I found the chocolate peanut butter mixture to be too thick and there wasn't nearly enough powdered sugar. Typically you mix the chow in a paper bag with a lot of powdered sugar to coat the cereal. I highly recommend doing that and increasing the powdered sugar to 1+ cups if you are thinking about making this recipe. I still had to pick apart the pieces after shaking it with powdered sugar - again - because the chocolate peanut butter mixture was too thick causing them to stick together in large clumps.
