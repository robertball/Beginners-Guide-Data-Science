Just added more cheese and covered the top with jalapeno slices. Took it to work and it was gone in no time. I will definitely make it again very soon.

An excellent and easy recipe. My only future modification will be to spice it up next time with some Rotelle.

Really yummy, but needs a little spicing-up for us. One of my cans of retried beans was jalapeño spicy and I'm glad. I would add maybe corn, diced green chili peppers, maybe green onions. Super good base dip that you can add your favorites to. Use sturdy scoops tortilla chips, or Fritos would be tasty. Perfect for tailgate or football watching!

This all got eaten - that is a good thing!  BTW - this can be made and placed in a slow cooker to keep warm.

This was great. I wish I would have taken a picture. I added onions and jalapeños for some kick. I was worried that it would look awful, but addding the cheese on top made a difference and it tasted so good, no one cared what it looked like. Maybe would be even better with sausage. Nice job, thanks for the recipe!

This was a nice change from the normal canned chili/velveeta cheese Dip I usually make~!! The only thing I did different was to sprinkle some taco sauce on it just before serving~!! Great 5***** recipe~
