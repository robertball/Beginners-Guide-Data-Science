Just make sure that your protein powder is heat stable, as most aren't.  If the protein powder isn't heat stable, the protein will break down & you won't be getting the full amount of added protein.  Optimal Nutrition makes a heat stable protein called Any Whey.  It is heat stable up to 450 degrees.  I use it to make my own protein bars.

I was so excited to find a recipe that would use up that extra protein powder I had sitting around my house.  I was wondering if the cookies would be any good, and they really really were!  One note - I did use a chocolate flavored powder which seemed to blend well with the other ingredients.  The cookies seem a little 'heavy' but they are soft and delicious!  Also, my yield was much higher, and I made them into what I thought were decent-sized cookies.  Thanks for a good and interesting recipe!

I loved this!  I used milk as suggested and because of the comments about the consistency of the cookies, i.e. cake like, I pressed the dough into a 9 x 13 pan.  The came out like brownies and were wonderful.  I also used splenda brown sugar mix and regular spenda in place of the sugar.  I used butter flavored Pam to coat the pan.

I used chocolate protein powder and a little extra peanut butter, and milk instead of water.  I added rum-soaked raisins to the mix and made the cookies double-sized.  A couple that were slightly undercooked were moist in the center, others were more cake-like.  I recommend the moist ones, and next time I want to use vanilla protein powder and white chocolate chips!

Just made a batch but without chocolate chips. The cookies taste great. They're a little dry, - you need a glass of water by your side, but they're really good. I'm happy to have found a high protein recipe!

I made a several alterations here, ok, so maybe its a totally new recipe? LOL - no butter, ONLY peanut butter, only 1 C brown sugar, no white sugar, no water instead I put 1/3 cup coconut milk and i replaced 1/2 cup flour with coconut flour, sprayed a 9x13 cake pan and spread it out like brownie dough. oh, i skipped the chocolate chips, cuz i later cut the "cake" into strips and dipped in melted choclate like biscotti... the coconut flour will absorb your liquid so donT be worried that the batter is too runny... and i baked at 350 for 30 minutes. If you donT want it like biscotti, bake for only 25 minutes... Delicious!!

I used whole wheat flour and Splenda instead of white sugar and they were still tasty! I will definitely make these again and next time I'll follow another reviewer's tip and use milk instead of water.

My boys loved this. It was a little cake like, but to have the extra protein in it, it was worth it. I will definitely make this again.

The flavor was great!! The consistency was "cake-like," so I think I'll try them as cupcakes.

Thanks so much for the Recipe!  Here are the changes I made that made it a bit healthier and they're delicious.
1. Replaced 1/2 cup flour with 1 cup oats
2. Replaced white sugar with an extra 1/2 cup protein powder
3. Added half cup each of sunflower seeds and chopped peanuts
THANKS AGAIN!

I used milk instead of water and they where the BEST COOKIES EVER! They where almost like a cake or a bread and only a hint of peanut butter. Plus they where easy to make. This is my go-to recipe now for cookies.

These came out great. I substituted the all-purpose flour with oat flour (just blended up 1 1/2 cups old fashion oats) and milk instead of water. Would probably go for a tasteless protein powder next time.

Tasty, after a few changes... I only used 2 eggs, which helps make them less cake-like.  Also used more peanut butter and milk instead of water as others did.  I only used a cup of flour and added 3/4 cup of oatmeal.  Boyfriend approves!

Very good! Definitely a cakey cookie, but that's not terrible. I had vanilla protein powder, so I left out the extract. Next time I'll add more chocolate chips, but otherwise I thought they were great. Note: the batter is very soft, but don't be alarmed. Just leave a lot of room for spreading. These also make great ice cream sandwiches!

THESE ARE AMAZING! I did make some changes though....

I added an additional 1/2 cup of flour so I could substitute agave nectar for the white sugar, used egg replacer instead of eggs, used vegan chocolate chips, and mashed a banana into the mix. I will be making them again! Mmmm.

These cookies are great for eating on the go or to stop you from being hungry.  These certainly aren't the type of cookies I get hungry to eat but they are perfect to eat on the way to school or work or even a late midnight snack to stop your hunger.  

**MAKE SURE YOU BUY PROTEIN POWDER THAT CAN HANDLE HEAT -- Like GNC's AMP: Amplified Wheybolic Extreme 60, preferably "unflavored" for baking**

I made this with Peanut Butter powder instead of a true protien powder and a gluten free all purpose flour. It turned out really well. I was looking for a way to make a tasty kid and husband friendly protein snack. They all really liked it. Makes for easy breakfast. 
It did turn out cake like- which is probably do to a gluten free flour, either way we are saving the recipe to keep making and tinkering to our likes and tastes.

I knocked off one star, because of these cookies being dry.  Otherwise, they were great tasting.  I like this type of thing in the morning(not a eggs, bacon or cereal person) and these are a way of getting my protein.  Will try to tweak this recipe, since I like it so much.
