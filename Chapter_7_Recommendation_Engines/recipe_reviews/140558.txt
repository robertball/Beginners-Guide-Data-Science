A little sweet as written!  I skipped the simple syrup on the second one and it was much better.  Also, I used diet lemon-lime soda.  Otherwise, very flavorful and an attractive drink too.  I also added a few pomegranate seeds to the glass.

Easy and tasty! Really liked the color too. I might reduce either the amount of soda or simple syrup, it is on the sweet side. But I will definitely be making this again and again!
