A unique and delicious breakfast! I decided to make this last minute and used white grape juice to cook the quinoa...great flavor with the berries. The glaze has a wonderful flavor, and I made a little extra to pour over the quinoa. Like lutzflcat, I also used the zest from the lemon...a Meyer lemon in this case. I used vanilla almond milk and raw honey instead of maple syrup...just what I had on hand. A sprinkle of chopped almonds and I had a protein-packed and very good breakfast! This is definitely a keeper for me, and it has many options for different flavor combinations that I look forward o trying.  Mine never really solidified to the point of slicing, but I found I prefer this heated with a little extra almond milk poured over it, anyway, so it didn't matter.

I had to sub Silk Coconut Milk (what I had on hand) for the almond milk but, otherwise, followed the recipe.  Honestly, I haven't eaten a lot of  quinoa, but I enjoyed this; my husband, not so much.  It could be that he hasn't eaten enough quinoa to become a fan of it.  He thought it was just O.K., ate it, but said he wouldn't ask me to make again.  The thing that was surprisingly good to me was the glaze to which I added the zest of the lemon which really brightened the flavor.  If you're a quinoa lover, give this one a try.  It certainly was "outside the box" for us, but it was a nice change for breakfast today.

It was okay, but too "watery." And the glaze needs more flavor. I like the idea of it and feel it has potential, but the cooking time was greatly underestimated. When I make it the next time,  I will possibly use less juice. Like 4 1/2 cups instead of six, and for the glaze, 2 or 3 lemons instead of one. Possibly more maple syrup

I made this to be eaten as a breakfast meal or a snack.  It is not very sweet, so don't expect a "dessert" per se.  I didn't have a full pint of blueberries on hand so I added craisins.  Then I added some shredded coconut to take it up to yet another level.  I did have to cook the quinoa about twice as long as the recipe called for, but if you've ever cooked quinoa before, you know that you cook it until all the water is absorbed.  Mine set up enough to slice.  For the glaze, due to not having fresh lemons, I substituted lemon juice.   All in all, I thought this was a great recipe and will definitely make it again.

I will  definitely  make this again.  I  have a  metal  fine mesh strainer  which  has  an attached stand I  put  the strainer in a bowl  and did a very nice  rince ( till water was clean) It   cooked well  and the only changes I made were I 
used  the squeeze  lemon  and I  used  honey (Blueberry raw honey)  It tasted  really  good. I  only had vanilla almond milk so the glaze was on the sweet  side. This is a good way to get the family into eating more quinoa

I thought this was more suited for breakfast rather than dessert. I gave it 3 stars due to the flavor and grainy consistency of the glaze. This is a good base recipe that can be changed for many options.

The amount f lemon juice was very subjective. Listing one lemon juiced doesn't tell you how big of  lemon (come in all sizes) or how much juice is really needed.  Not much flavor in the topping.

This was pretty good. I definitely made some changes, though. I cut this recipe by 2/3 (there are only two of us in the house, and due to dietary issues, neither of us eats much), so 1c quinoa and I used only 1.5 c of apple juice for the quinoa (based on some of the reviews... we wanted something not soupy/gloppy).  I also felt it needed more sweetness. I used honey instead of maple syrup (I don't like the fake stuff and that's all we had in the house) and ran out (I had enough for the recipe, but not extra), so I added stevia to up the sweetness in both. I added cinnamon to the quinoa and instead of adding blueberries at the end, I added them 10 minutes into cooking the quinoa and let them cook together for the last five minutes of cooking. 

I had extra fresh squeezed lemon juice and just made the full amount of topping (several reviews said they made extra, so I just didn't cut that part of the recipe down). That topping is TART!! I used honey AND stevia in it and I think it was still almost too bold. My boyfriend said it was better in the middle where it had soaked into the quinoa overnight, so I might not let it thicken as much next time so it'll soak in more fully. 

I think this recipe has a LOT of potential though. We always have fruit in the house, and since it's autumn, I think I'm going to try an apple/cranberry/walnut version with a cinnamon caramel topping next time. And maybe raspberries or blackberries with the lemon, or mangoes with lime instead of lemon.

A great way to incorporate quinoa.  I  made a small change and decided to layer with a top coating of banana cream pudding made with unsweetened almond milk.  Delish!

Tolerable, but I wouldn't make it again. It makes a ton. I like the level of sweetness, but not really feeling it with the quinoa. Maybe the topping would be good drizzled over some fresh fruit.

Ran out of apple juice so had to use a cup of cranberry juice to complete the liquid to cook the quinoa.  My husband loved it heated in the microwave and asked me to make it again.  I thought it was good, but needed something sweet.  I didn't add any sweetener so that I could retain its healthiness.

We love it it’s become my wife’s favorite and I make it Easter make it Mother’s Day I make it every other week during the summer. We only change the recipe by adding 3 tablespoons of maple syrup instead of one and she likes the lemon zest on top.
