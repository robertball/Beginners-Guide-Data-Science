Awesome! I didn't add the extra pepper to the mix - only used the tops. Instead of the diced tomatoes and tomato paste, I used tomato sauce (Ragu's Super Vegetable Primavera - added extra veggies). I also didn't precook the peppers, just stuffed them and baked them for 40 minutes. My husband ate his in what seemed like two minutes!
Here is the exact recipe I used:

DIRECTIONS

1.   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
2.   In a skillet over medium heat, add the turkey, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Cook the turkey or beef until no longer pink. Set aside. In same skillet, heat oil. Add onion, mushrooms, zucchini, and chopped pepper tops and cook until tender. Add spinach and stir until wilted. Return turkey to the skillet. Mix in the tomato sauce. 
3.   Place the red peppers into a square glass baking dish.  Stuff the peppers with the skillet mixture.  Add any remaining mixture to baking dish around peppers.
4.   Bake peppers for 40 minutes.
5.   While peppers are baking, cook pasta according to directions on box.  After draining pasta, add a bit of olive oil to keep it from sticking.
6.   To plate, place pasta on plate and top with pepper.  Sprinkle with parmesan cheese, if desired.

Hope this helps - these came out perfect!

This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write a review for a recipe and felt that I must because I can't remember the last time I had a low fat meal with so much flavor!! I had some extra filling left over and put it over rice the next day! Fantastic!!

This was extra yummy.  I always boil my peppers before stuffing them.  It only takes about 10-15 minutes.  Then if you didn't want to heat up your kitchen with the oven, just stuff with the sauted turkey, veggies,and seasonings and microwave for about 1 minute per pepper.  This is the best stuffed pepper recipe!

I thought this was a great base recipe! I think the most important mod you can make to this recipe though is to add seasoning to the turkey BEFORE stuffing the peppers. Ground turkey is so bland, but it really comes alive with some salt, pepper, oregano, basil, paprika, and maybe another spice that I'm missing off the top of my head. My fiance and I thought this made a great meal.

very good, and my boyfriend loved it. i used one person's suggestion to use tomato sauce- i baked the peppers in     loaf pans and poured a can of tomato sauce around them and added some italian seasoning into the sauce. i made angel hair pasta for the side, and i also left out the mushrooms, and added red pepper and chili powder to the mixture. very good. when i prebaked the green peppers, i turned them upside down in loaf pans, and the water just collected in the bottom of the pan, and kept them very moist. i had no problems with the mixture being dry- it was very good.

I love this recipe because I love recipes that taste great and let my imagination run wild!  I added some shredded carrots and used sun-dried tomato paste from a tube so I wouldn't have to open a can just for a tbsp.  Made it with red and green peppers.  The red peppers win!  Now thinking of other possiblities.  What about adjusting ingredients and serving in sweet onion shells or tomato shells instead of pepper shells?  What about compacting the turkey filling into a loaf pan, topping with tomato/cheese sauce and serving as a turkey meatloaf?  What about adding tomato sauce to the turkey mix and ladling it over a toasted mini-bagel and topping everything with a poached egg for brunch?  Warning.  Have not tried these ideas.  Just thinking.

A great change from the same old beef and rice filled peppers.  Our friends raved about them. I did modify the recipe somewhat.  After I stuffed the peppers I simmered them in a "homemade" tomato sauce for an hour. I used a 13 oz. can of sauce, tablespoon of sugar, teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, and a teaspoon of oregano.  This added some flavor and kept the peppers moist.

Delicous. Fabulous consistency.
Only 7 Weight Watchers flex plan points per pepper.
Rather than add additional pepper to the veggie mix, I added ten black olives, two celery stalks and two small summer squash.
Will make this recipe often. Mom tried the filling cold and wants the recipe!
Thank you,
Debra

This is very tasty and healthy.  I browned the onions for a long time first before adding the garlic the turkey and just cooked until no longer pink. Sprinkled in extra herbs and spices like cayenne, too, to taste.  Sometimes, I use jarred sauce instead of paste and tomatoes.  Sometimes, I sub in a tiny bit of other shredded veggies such as carrot, celery, or black olives, too.  Husband is a meat and potatoes guy, but he likes these with cheese and carbs on the side.  Very good change from the ground beef and rice standard recipe.

Very tasty & the cooking time worked out perfectly for me.  I added some crushed red pepper flakes for additional seasoning.  Next time, I will add less ground turkey & more vegetables - specifically mushrooms & zucchini.  I will absolutely make this again...just spice it up a bit more...perhaps with some diced jalapenos.  YUM !

Good grief was this good! Of course I made changes to suit my tastes (if you don't like reviewers that do that then don't read any further). Here are my changes: 1) i sauteed some garlic in olive oil, seasoned the turkey breast with red pepper, oregano, basil, parmesan cheese, salt and pepper and then put the turkey in the garlic/olive oil combo; 2) i used 2 zucchinis, an 8oz container of mushrooms and probably a good bit more spinach since it wilts so much; 3) i made my own marinara sauce (garlic and olive oil sauteed, can of crushed tomatoes added, oregano and basil). After following the rest of the directions as written I added almost all of my marinara sauce (15 oz or so) to the mixture then i put in about a quarter of cup of mozzarella and prob 2 tbsps of parmesan; stuffed the pre-baked peppers, topped with marinara and put them back in. With 5 minutes to go - I added shredded mozzarella to the tops of each. I know this would have been good without the cheese but I was craving it! All in all, this is a fantastic idea/recipe - i will make again. The only thing I will do differently is bake the peppers a bit more - they were a little too crunchy for my tastes. Otherwise - A+++.

Decent tasting, but bland for my preferences.  The peppers don't need to be pre-cooked.  Just leave the whole deal in the oven longer, which is better anyway.  The flavors come together more.

Loved this recipe. My husband was hesitant to try it, said it wouldn't be filling...no issues with still being hungry after dinner though. Instead of cutting the tops off of the peppers, I cut them in half (ensuring to also cut the stem in half), this makes for a much prettier presentation. I also baked them for 20 minutes instead of 15. When I pulled them out of the oven, I heard my husband say, "Huh". It was quite the compliment. After tasting them, he smiled and said they were really good. Asked me later if I was going to keep the left over pepper so he could have it tomorrow for lunch. Next time I make this, I think I'll add some crushed red pepper to the mix for a little kick. I won't change anything else though. Wasn't dry and loved the mix of veggies (instead of the traditional rice). I did cut this recipe in half since it was just the two of us.

I tried this recipe after reading many reviews and made my own adjustments accordingly. Me and my boyfriend love spicy food so I added some cumin and chili powder to the turkey during cooking. This added flavor and the amount of heat we like. I also added corn kernels and brown rice to the mixture because we had some on hand. I baked the peppers alone for 15 minutes as directed and then baked the stuffed peppers for 20 minutes before adding a little mozzarella and cheddar cheese to the tops and baking 5 more mins to melt. They came out perfect! They were not too soft but not too crunchy and the filling was amazing! We got large peppers and still had filling left, I am going to eat the left over filling for lunch tomorrow- it's that good! Definitely making this again!

I am not one to eat the green pepper but I loved the flavor that it brought to the filling. This was a very tasty recipe.

This was really good! Just got finished eating it 2 minutes ago. I used yellow peppers because my parents don't like green, used beef because the store didn't have turkey, and added an italian cheese blend to the centers and top of the peppers. Seasoned the beef very well, and used diced tomatoes AND tomato sauce. I didn't pre bake; i baked them (stuffed) for 20 mins covered with foil and then 20 minutes uncovered, sprinkling with cheese for the last minute. YUM!!!

I'm REALLY NOT a pepper fan but I had some to use up.  This was really good.  I think you can adjust it to use the veggies that you like.  I used half a pepper, about half a pound of portobello mushrooms (that were on their last legs), a handful of mini carrots and a medium onion, all of which I whirled in a food processor to chop fine.  I added Montreal Steak Seasoning to the turkey when it was browning.  I used some seasoned crushed tomatoes that I had leftover from another recipe and added about one cup of cooked brown rice.  Mixed the veggies, rice and turkey and some garlic together and packed the raw pepper cups full and baked in individual ramekins for about 30 minutes.  The peppers lost their strong taste and were sweet and delicious.  I have some leftover filling but also more peppers so I'll make these again.  What a pleasant surprise!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  THE WAY THAT I HAVE ALWAYS COOKED ALL OF MY STUFFED PEPPERS, IS TO STUFF THE PEPPERS RAW, AND I TAKE A MUFFING PAN, FILL ALL OF THE HOLES HALFWAY WITH WATER, AND BALANCE THE STUFFED PEPPERS ON TOP.  THIS IS BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE FLAVOR OF OVER-COOKED BELL PEPPERS.  THEY ARE DONE WHEN A KNIFE JUST EASILY PRICKS THE SKIN. A JUST DONE PEPPER ADDS A REALLY FRESH TASTE AND BRIGHTER COLOR TO THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE.

Not only was this a super healthy meal, but they were outstanding!  I followed the advice of Michelle K. and used Ragu Garden Vegetable sauce instead of the tomatoes and paste.  I used 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and plenty of salt and pepper when cooking the meat, which gave it perfect flavor.  This will be a usual in our dinner rotation from now on! :)

We thought this was wonderful!  I've made it with both ground beef and ground turkey and the recipe turns out perfect.  Don't be shy with the garlic powder, spices and use a lot of salt and pepper.  I also put them in raw and cooked for 40 minutes like the other reviewer - and they were just perfect.  Highly recommended!

WOW WOW WOW!!! I had to get on this site and make sure this recipe got a rating it deserved! I made this meal for a group of 10 people. For looks I used yellow and orange peppers as the "bowl". I browned my turkey (3 pounds for 12 peppers) with salt pepper and garlic powder until it wasn't pink. I then put that in a bowl and added the oil and all the veggies to the pot. I added green and red peppers to this mixture for looks! I also added salt pepper, a few crushed red peppers and garlic powder again. I let this cook until they were very soft and almost created their own broth. I added just a small amount of veggie pasta sauce to that and then put the meat back in. Once everything was stirred thoroughly, I packed the mixture into the pepper shells. I sprinkled just a little sharp cheddar cheese on top and put them back in the oven for 10 -15 minutes until the cheese was bubbly. This recipe was such a BIG hit. It was DELICIOUS! So much flavor and color. Such a wonderful recipe, everyone raved about it! Will DEFINITELY make this one again!!!!

Other than accidentally mincing the onions in the food processor instead of chopping them, this recipe was uber easy to make.. I doubled it, using 1 yellow,  4 red and 4 green peppers.. had plenty of stuffing.  smells wonderful cooking.. used suggestions of tomato sauce on instad of paste.. had to strain the mixture a little, as it was watery, but definately a keeper!

This was delicious!!  I used a variety of bell peppers (red, orange & yellow) and chopped and used the tops that I cut off as the pepper to saute with the onion, instead of buying additional peppers.  I seasoned the turkey with kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, garlic and onion powders.  I did not have zucchini on hand, so instead added additional mushrooms and some scallions.  The only other variation was to sprinkle in some red pepper flake for some kick.  This was so delicious, my family of 3 ate all 4 peppers as well as the additional stuffing that was left over (baked in a small baking dish for last 7 minutes while peppers were cooking.  This was instantaneously decided to include in our "to be made again" file.  Thanks so much for posting.  Plus this was low-carb with no rice or orzo, which fits right in with my diet.  Bon!

The filling for these peppers is terrific. I used basil and garlic flavored diced tomatoes and omitted the tomato paste (didn't have any). I also added some chopped fresh basil to the mixture. For the Italian seasoning I used dry Italian dressing mix. It was really tasty. A little Parmesan cheese on top and it makes a delicious and filling meal.

Loved it.  I did cook the peppers for 25 - 30 minutes because I like my peppers softer.  I doubled the stuffing recipe and used it in eggplant lasagna.  Fabulous and so filling.  I am doing Weight Watchers Core Program and this was a great find.

Thanks
Joy

We love this recipe! Stuffed peppers that taste great without the added carbs from rice! The vegetable mixture is great.. although we also like summer (yellow) squash, so I added half of one chopped to the mix also.  I also used "italian seasoned" diced tomatoes when I made it, and added some extra garlic powder.  I agree with the previous reviewer that the turkey and vegetable mixture would even be good on it's own.

Have to add some things, but a great foundation. I kept draining the veggies and added some breadcrumbs just before stuffing the peppers to prevent against the watery problem people noted. I definitely prefer red and yellow peppers over green...much sweeter. Also make sure to add lots of extra seasonings to flavor the turkey. Very versatile.

Fabulous recipe!  It was easy and delicious.  I ended up modifying the recipe by taking out the mushrooms (due to my husband's dislike for them).  I didn't have spinach, so I chopped up some red cabbage that I had left.  My husband and I really enjoyed the meal!

I really enjoyed this recipe, even though i am not a big pepper fan.  I skipped the chopped pepper on the inside and used a cheese tomato pasta sauce instead of diced tomatoes and paste.  I also cooked the turkey with the onion and seasonings to give it more flavor.  I added 1/2 of dry stuffing mix with great success, and really like the addition comparing the before and after.

Super yummy and the stuffing makes a great topping over rice as well! I doubled the veggies and portabello mushrooms and added a little bit more spice to it but I loved them and they reheated very very well as leftovers.

A very healthy version of Stuffed Peppers.  I still prefer a stuffed pepper with rice and ground beef, but this is a good alternative.  I may do as another member suggested and make the vegetable mixture and mix with rice or Quinoa.  Thank you for sharing!

Microwave the peppers prior to baking them; fill a pyrex dish 1/4 way with water and nuke 'em 10 mins. They are cooked but not mushy. I also like to cut the pepper lengthwise rather than cut the tops off to pack more filling inside.

Fantastic recipe!  I didn't precook the peppers, just stuffed them raw and baked for about 40 minutes.  The filling stayed moist, and the peppers were delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I made these last night along with the mushroom rice and everything was AMAZING! We seriously couldn't think of a meal that we have had that was that good in a long time....yum, it was great! We prefer spicy italian sausage, so we put that in instead of the turkey and we also put in additional yellow and orange peppers and yellow squash. We omitted the zucchini and the mushroom, as we had the mushroom in the rice. However, the great thing about this recipe is you can omit and add anything you want based on your likes and dislikes. Amazing, amazing, amazing! Thanks for posting this recipe!!

These are  very good. Extremely filling and tastes for so few calories. I like to use all red peppers because they taste oh so much better...not so bitter.  Baked them alone longer than the initial 15 ,I mutes because they still seemed pretty firm. I also double the mushrooms and add more tomato paste to make it more savory and help meld/stick the ingredients together (and never have an issue with dryness this way). For the chopped peppers I use the whole thing. With these changes I can fill about 5 -6 peppers. So yummy and so healthy. Thank you!

Yummy!! This is the first time I've had stuffed peppers and after trying this recipe I love them!! I added celery, carrots, apples, and thai chiles, and I didn't have zucchini so I left that out. Following the suggestion of another reviewer I baked them for 40 minutes after stuffing and didn't pre-bake them at all. They were a little bit dry so when I warmed the leftovers up I poured a can of Mexican flavored tomato sauce over them and simmered them on medium heat until warm. This was a definite improvement and I will make it this way in the future. Thanks so much for sharing!!:)

The green peppers were very hard.  I wish I would have boiled them first as another reviewer said.  I added about a tsp of Italian seasoning & 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to the turkey, but it turned out very bland.  I'd suggest putting a lot of seasoning on this dish.  I used a package of 1.25 lb turkey and I had so much left over I could have filled 3 more peppers.  I served over a bed of white rice.

Fantastic as written.  I added some parmesean and shredded mozzerella as we are cheese fanatics. Can also microwave cored and seeded peppers cut side down on plate covered w/plastic wrap for 2-3 min.  Helps soften them. Then bake in 350 oven for 30 min.

Such a good recipe!  Easy to make and my kids loved it!  I used yellow and orange peppers instead of green, added about  1/4 tsp allspice and a little Parmesan cheese on top.   Definitely a favorite!

Amazing! Just a few alterations... skipped the mushrooms simply because I didn't have any and changed the seasoning to cilantro instead of Italian. Pre-cooked pepper in oven for about 10 minutes and used a mixture of brown rice and quinoa along with turkey and veggies. Better than my Mom's old rice and beef filling!

I changed it up a little bit, like all cooks do.  I used the green/orange bells along with zuccini/onions and tomato's.  Sautee'd that with virgin olive oil and italian seasonings.  I cooked the turkey and set it to the side on low heat and added a cream of mushroom soup for the liquid aspect.  Cooked the bells in a loaf pan first with the foil covering, and while they were finishing blended the turkey and sautee'd veggie mix and let continue cook on low heat.  After putting the mixture in the cooked bells, I added alittle shredded cheese and put back in the oven.  I used Yellow / Orange / and Red bells for the base and made a stuffing mix for the side item.  Very colorful and perfect for the winter weather.  Thanks for the recipe!

I omitted the tomato paste because I ran out, and the resulting mixture was definitely too thin.  Would use a real tomato sauce or put in more than 1 tbsp tomato paste next time.

Not bad. Not a lot of flavor to it. If I make again I will be adding loads more seasonings, maybe some hot sauce. I have enough filling leftover for 3 or 4 more peppers. Guess I'll go buy more peppers. yay.

My whole family loved it - even my picky 7 year old. HOWEVER, I used a variety of peppers as shells and must say I liked the yellow and orange much more than the green :) Also, I really liked adding some Louisianna hotsauce for a little extra kick!

This was a great, healthy, and relatively light dinner that my wife and I loved. Looking for low or non-carb foods is often difficult, but this was a very welcome surprise.

I changed the recipe slightly, as my wife and I both don't really like green peppers, so we replaced them w/ yellow and orange ones. I also did not use mushrooms or spinach, but included large white beans and pine nuts in the mix of ingredients instead. White beans added a nice visual element and a totally different texture. So good! And lastly, I used two whole fresh tomatoes, diced rather than the canned diced tomatoes - all in all a great meal - 2 meals for us actually. Only thing I might revise is the cooking time at the end, I would add another 20 minutes +/- so the peppers are more fully cooked. I followed the times almost exactly and the peppers were a bit al dente - but still great! 

A very flavorful meal - I highly recommend it.

I used the exact same ingredients, however, I substituted the meat with Ground Chicken and it was so delicious! I added fresh garlic, oregano and parsely to the seasonings as well. Two thumbs up!!

LOVED these peppers! I actually cooked some brown rice in chicken broth and added it into the mix. Also, I didnt add extra peppers into it, I just chopped up the tops and threw them in. Very good.

Delicious. It's really easy to add whatever kind of vegetable you want. Sometimes I'll even add leftover pasta sauce that's in the fridge and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese 10 minutes before the end of baking. Always an easy weeknight meal to fix. Also, great leftovers!

I am going against the grain again to say this recipe does NOT deserve its almost perfect rating!!!!  It is not that excellent.  The flavor was ok.  The texture was off (too watery) and the peppers tasted raw.  I gave it 2 stars because it was edible and healthy.

This is a great recipe I have now made several times!  I have left my cooking a little bit longer to ensure the peppers are nice a soft!

Delicious! Made it 2x and both times it was outstanding! I did change a few things by omitting the additional chopped peppers and I used red peppers to stuff instead of green.  I also added cooked brown rice (about 1/2 cup), a few dashes of Worstcestshire sauce and some grated parmesean to the mixture. Don't cheat yourself by adding garlic powder.  If you are going through the trouble of chopping all the other veggies, use fresh garlic!

I left out the yellow and red bell peppers. I just added the tops of the green peppers to the mix. Quite good! Also used tomato sauce (for pasta) instead of the tomatoes, paste and seasoning and followed the advice of another reviewer by simply cooking all ingredients together for 40 minutes rather than cooking the peppers, adding the ingredients and then cooking together.

This is a great low carb recipe! No rice or flour.  I didn't have any turkey so I used half ground beef & half italian sausage.  I used red, green, yellow, & orange peppers.  I used the top of each to chop up for the filling.   I used all the filling ingredients except for the 1Tbl of tomato paste- I used some of the drained juice from the tomatoes instead.   The flavor is really good and the presentation was incredible with all the colors of the peppers.

I made this for dinner last night and am so enjoying the leftovers for lunch as I write!  My husband is doing a low carb diet and this was a perfect meal for him (and me!).  The filling was excellent.  I agree the cooking times are off if you like your peppers very soft and not crunchy....the peppers just don't get soft enough and needed much longer to bake before filling.  To reduce the baking time, I would blanch the green peppers next time in boiling water for about  5-7 min as was recommended by another reviewer.  Then stuff them with the filling and baked for 15 min.  I made some slight variations in the filling just because of personal preference: omitted onions and zucchini because we don't like them, used fresh chopped garlic, omitted tomato paste and used crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  This tasted so great.  Just make sure to use enough seasoning to your liking!!  I also snuck some goat cheese crumbles into a couple of the peppers for variation.  That was excellent too!

These were good.  Surprisingly, my husband ate every bite.  We're trying to eat less carbs and this is a great recipe for those on a low carb diet.  We topped with a little freshly grated parmesan cheese and tomato sauce.

After reading several reviews, I sauteed the onions and fresh garlic, then seasoned the turkey with the Italian seasoning.  Instead of the canned tomatoes, I used Rotel which really kicked it up a few notches! I also added some cooked rice to the stuffing.  I did pre bake the peppers for 15 minutes and had to bake the stuffed peppers an additional 10 minutes for the peppers to be more tender.  My husband and mother in law loved them.

This was a good recipe.  I added more onion and spinach and more seasoning.  Next time I think I will use yellow/red or orange peppers and I will cook them longer in the oven for more tenderness.  The stuffing mixture would be great by its self or maybe with some brown or white rice.

We liked the stuffing, especially nice for a gluten-free, diabetic family like mine... but the peppers were not cooked all the way...and after more cooking they were kind of tough. I have cooked stuffed bellpeppers covered in a microwave...I think I'll try this again but cook the dish in the micro.

Really tasty!  I had never had a stuffed pepper, and I could have lived without the pepper part; it was just ok.  The filling was very good, so I look forward to making it in lots of other ways - as a pasta sauce, over rice, in a wrap, etc.

Very easy and delicious! No need to purchase extra peppers for the filling, though; chopping up the tops that you've cut off gives you the same amount. You can use red, yellow, orange - whichever colour you prefer! I liked another reviewers suggestion of replacing the canned tomatoes and paste with some Primavera sauce. I served the stuffed peppers with pasta, and we were able to mix the filling that fell out with it to have a scrumptious and nutritious meal that even the kids devoured. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, but tasted really really healthy.  Just not really fun, but if you're trying to lose weight, this is a great recipe because it's really light and veg heavy.  I didn't use extra peppers, just the tops and I only used 1 tbsp of oil.  I used a whole onion and a lot of salt to season.  I also put some parmesan cheese on the top at the end of the baking time but I wouldn't do that next time.  Not sure it went right.  The next day the filling was good with some spicy peach salsa.

This is a very refreshing alternative to the norm. I made this last week and my wife and a couple of our neighbors loved it. One of them didn't even like stuffed peppers before this. I have a feeling that if you are not careful this can dry out. I might try a little tomato sauce with white wine next time but even without it this is delicious.

This was a great recipe!  I was surprised just how much of a punch of flavor this packed overall. I was liberal in my use of the garlic powder and Italian seasoning but didn’t make any additions in terms of spices. I opted to use a variety of cherry tomatoes that I had on hand instead of the recommended can of diced tomatoes. I also added 3 diced jalapeños (seeds and all) to give it a kick. I topped the peppers with manchego cheese for the last 15 minutes of baking since I enjoy a cheese element to stuff peppers. They turned out great! My wife who wasn’t especially excited about the meal was fully converted after tasting, requesting that this be put on the list of regular meal options. This is a keeper. It is healthy, economical, and easy to prepare.

Delicious and easy to make.  I added cooked rice to the mix and had to precook the bell peppers for 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes perhaps because I used large peppers.

Stuffed mixture into yellow & orange bell peppers, and per other reviews didn't chop up extra peppers, but used the tops of the ones I was stuffing.  Omitted mushroom, but added carrot.  Also put in some garlic, oregano and basil.  Instead of tomato paste, added just a bit of marina sauce to coat the filling.  Baked for 30-35 minutes, instead of breaking the baking up into two 15 min. segments.  Turned out delicious!

As someone else said, this is a great base recipe, however the Turkey is incredibly bland which makes for a slightly lifeless end result. I added a small can of tomato sauce and instead  of zuchini I used 4 carrots which I chopped in the food processor. I will make this again, but next time I will go much heavier on the seasonings. Hope this is helpful :)

Made a vegetarian version of this last night with two HUGE red peppers (got 4 big servings by cutting them in half, though I did have to cook them longer to get those honkers tender). I used tofu/soy crumbles instead of ground turkey, shook a bunch of Italian-ish spices into the mixture pre-tomato sauce, and left the cut-up pepper out of the mix (seemed redundant). Served it on bulgur with a fruit salad. 

And WOW. Boyfriend commented on its deliciousness twice during the meal and asked me to make it again soon. We both do happily eat meat, but like to eat veggo meals frequently and he said he couldn't imagine this being any better with turkey. I agree. Will make this again soon!

LOVED THIS! I made this last night and it was my 1st time ever making stuffed peppers and they turned out amazing. I followed the recipe exactly but added 1 diced jalepeno, diced up garlic cloves instead of garlic powder,crushed red pepper flakes and smoked turkey sausage added with the ground turkey. Just had some leftovers today and it was still great reheated!! its a must try! and healthy!

I didn't include the diced peppers and added extra spinach and zucchini. I also didn't add the tomato paste and added a little tomato sauce.  In the future, I would add oregano or other italian seasoning. Overall really delicious and filling without being high calorie.

I recently tried this recipe as a healthy alternative to the old fashioned meat and rice stufed peppers. I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor. 
I added a couple of extra items: 1. Corn sliced off the, 2.Feta cheese.
I placed the feta cheese in the bottom of the pepper filled the pepper half way and put another layer of Feta cheese and filled the remaining half of the pepper with meat mix and baked.

I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious! You can pretty much use any veggies you like. I sautéd 4 cloves of chopped garlic before browning the turkey and added red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. I will be making this again!

All I have to say is OMG!! Healthy and delicious! I just put the peppers in the oven and I can't stop eating the leftover filling! I only used green peppers this time cuz the red were $1.50 each today! I added some fresh garlic to the veggies, and probably added some more then the recommended seasonings just for some more flavor. Great recipe. Great base to start with to use whatever ingredients you want.

Great healthy recipe.  I added red chili flakes to the stuffing the spice things up a bit.  Great for dinner and the leftover stuffing was great over brown rice the next day.

Excellent, stuck to the recipe and thoroughly enjoyed it. A little extra spices next time, but thats all. Boiled peppers 15 minutes versus oven method, drained them upside down while making the mixture.

This is a fantastic turkey/veggie mix. I used Rotel for the tomatoes. We're not such green pepper fans so I mixed it with penne pasta. Yum!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out divine!  Because my small children have a hard time eating out of bellpeppers, I serve the stuffing for them with barley on the side.  This is one of few recipes which I go back to again and again.  DELICIOUS!

The stuffing is excellent.  I stuck to the recipe except for omitting the yellow and red peppers because I didn't have any.  I didn't love eating the pepper shell, but that is just my issue.  My husband finished his and one of the children's!

My family really enjoyed these, even my daughter that doesn't like vegies at all.  One thing we did was add italian cheese blend to the top the last few minutes of cooking.  It really was yummy...we decided next time we would add cheese into the mix before baking and then again on the top.  Just added that extra yum factor.  :-)

this would be delicious even as a vegetarian meal! My husband groaned when I told him what I was making but when he saw and tried them he raved about how good they were (not at all a normal reaction for him!). I made it just as written & they really were amazing! The key is to use plenty of the spices to season the turkey.

I made this recipe last night, and really enjoyed it!! the flavor is wonderful, and all the vegetables meshed well together. The only thing was the sauce itself was a little runny. That probably can be corrected by adding more tomato paste and perhaps some rice as a filler

I loved this but the peppers were a little under-cooked and the mixture was a little dry so next time I will boil the peppers for about 5 minutes first and add a little V8 juice and tomato paste to the mixture.

really good, but the cooking time is off. I cooked my peppers 20 minutes prior to stuffing and 15 after and they were still crunchy. Next time I'll cook 30 minutes prior to stuffing and 15 after.

Loved it. Followed the recipe and didn't make any substitutions. The only thing I would add is a bit more tomotoes to make it saucier. A great healthy and filling dish.

I used this recipe as a guideline for making a Veggie only version.  So I used 'Not Meat Crumbles' instead of the turkey meat.  And I added about 1-1/2 cup of cooked rice to the mix as well.  Came out pretty good.

I followed the advice of another & added paprika, seasoning salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, basil, and crushed red peppers to the meat while it was cooking. Otherwise it would have been bland. It turned out wonderful. My husband loved it. Will definitely be making this again.

Hmmm,I really don't know what to think,it's good mind you but...since there is really no instructions on the seasonings,I may have gone a tad almost over. I heard 'Too much italian seasoning but good!'

My husband had a heart attack a few weeks ago so we have been trying lots of low fat, low sodium recipes. This is a wonderful, tasty recipe, best stuffed peppers wev'e ever had. A real keeper and one to pass on to others.

For the most part I stuck to the recipe. I cut off the top, cleaned out the inside, and steamed my peppers instead of putting them in the oven first, as that is how I always make stuffed peppers. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and added a lot of extra garlic and red pepper flakes as my husband and I like spice. I also left out the tomato paste. However, I did put the peppers in a "bath" of spaghetti sauce in the oven. I used 4 cheese in a can- it is only 50 calories / half cup and it adds a nice flavorful sauce.

I love stuffed peppers and since I'm on South Beach, I was looking for something that didn't have rice or noodles involved. This one was great.
I changed it by using ground beef instead of turkey, minced garlic instead of powder, left out the tomato paste and used 1/2 box frozen spinach instead of fresh. I also added 1 2% cheddar kraft single slice to the top of each pepper in the last 5 minutes of cooking.
The peppers were a little tough, but I didn't use the tinfoil in the beginning and that must have been why. I put them back in for another 15 minutes and they were more tender then. REALLY GOOD.

Made this once with ground turkey and once with turkey sausage (removed from casings) and it was a hit both times.  I topped with some shredded cheese as well.  Delicious.

Really liked this - but just added premade spaghetti sauce from a jar instead of diced tomatos/sauce. Also added corn (just because I love corn in these types of things!). Worked out deliciously and very easy to make.

Very tasty and healthy recipe.  As a shortcut, I make the filling and add additional bell peppers instead of stuffing the peppers.  I serve over rice and sprinkle with parmesan cheese.

Wow, yummy!  This was soooo good.  Great way to use up veggies from your garden!  I loved it as is but next time I will add some crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.  The hubby thought it was a little bland.  Cheese would be good too!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed others suggestions...used tomato sauce, put italian seasoning, crushed peppers, salt/peppers with the turkey.  Didn't use mushrooms.  Baked the peppers for 40 minutes after stuffing them, then plated with yellow rice and topped with more tomato sauce.  This recipe was fantastic!

this was excellent.  We used beef instead of turkey and it was still great.  The stuffing would be great on pasta too instead of in pepper.  It was so yummy my dog even loved it enough to eat the veggies

Really great recipe... Added celery and water chesnuts to the list of veggies, Used Pam olive oil spray as I cooked veggies, added more garlic powder and seasonings than recommended, topped each pepper and additional stuffing with mozzerella and baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. Only drawback to baking was extra water in bottom of baking dish (because of uncooked peppers?) Didn't affect taste, though!

I'm on a huge kick right now to fill my freezer with home-cooked food for future meals.  My boyfriend eats a TON of food and I wanted to stretch this out so we could freeze half, and still be left with enough food to satisfy him at both meals.  In order to keep the costs down, I ended up adding about a cup of cooked brown rice, used the entire can of tomato paste, added a can of tomato sauce, and added 8 oz light velveeta (I know, I know...processed cheese ruins the health factor, but I love it so much!!!)  We both LOVED the result, as did a friend he brought home for dinner.  I had enough for four very large peppers the first night, and have a little more than that left over for a future meal.

I am following a low carb diet so this recipe is perfect! I used my microwave instead of the oven to keep the kitchen from getting too hot and the only other addition that I made was 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika. This is my favorite "new" spice so I have been adding it to everything!  I also topped  them with a bit of fresh parmesan cheese.  Yummy!

We loved this recipe.We found that baking the peppers first, left them a bit hard. However, we liked the filling so much, we diced the green peppers into the stuffing mixture and served it over rice, added some fresh garlic and stewed tomatoes and it was superb!
thanks for a great recipe!

I make this recipe all time and love it.  You can substitute and adjust amounts of all the veggies.  I always end up with too much filling so after I've filled the peppers I just dump the rest around the edges.  Sometimes I top them with mozzarella, cheddar, or whatever cheese I have.  One thing I do differently that others have suggested is to steam the peppers, otherwise they don't get cooked enough.

GREAT!  As suggested I made a double batch and there will be enough for 3 meals.  Froze the extras.  Tastes even better on the second day.  I also used red peppers to stuff instead of green and added yellow squash.  I use a spice called Spike and it really adds.  Also the grocery store had ground turkey with italian seasoning added.  !!!UPDATE!!!  Stopped stuffing the peppers and just chopped up some big pieces to cook up with the rest of the stuff!

Fabulous! I used red peppers and we all loved it, although I think next time I may just serve the stuffing over rice, I liked it even better plain. Thanks!

The stuffed peppers were delicious!  I used 99% fat free ground turkey and added extra spinach & mushrooms to the mix.  I didn't have any tomato paste, but added hoisin sauce & texas pete hot sauce to give the mixture more flavor.  I also sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top.  My boyfriend loved it!  I will definitely make this recipe again and again!

We have been making this with five red and yellow peppers since I don't care for green. Like others, I just dice the caps for the filling.  It makes more than enough to stuff five peppers. The leftover filling is great alone for lunch. My husband doesn't like zucchini and knows it is in this dish and LOVES it.  This has become our new favorite dinner and it's healthy!

A healthy alternative to a regular stuffed pepper.  I used red peppers rather than green since my husband and I like the sweeter taste.  It was delicious!

I dont pre cook my peppers. I added some meatloaf seasoning and zucchini and  squash,  mushrooms and couscous.  I used tomatoe sauce with a lil splenda brown sugar to cut  down on the acidity in the tomato sauce. I baked it for 1 hour .  30 minutes uncovered and 30 minutes covered with aluminum foil.  I used red, yellow, and orange Peppers. The green peppers are a little too strong and don't agree with us afterwards.  I also added an egg to the mixture and a lil water. so it would be moist. Very good. Hubby really liked it.

I liked this dish, made it to specification and came out great.  Quick, easy, and little mess.  I can see this being easily modified to suit your particluar tastes, different peppers and onions, maybe add some celery.  It is also super healthy, low to no saturated fats (coming mostly from the turkey) and a good, healthy mix of veggies.

Tasty!  Didn't bother wrapping the peppers in foil, and warmed them while the oven was preheating for 15 minutes.   Used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and diced them.  I drained the fat from the turkey and cooked the vegetables in the same skillet without needing to add more oil.  I used double the tomato paste since I had most of a can. Next time I'll just use ketchup. What ever didn't fit in the peppers I added around them in the casserole dish.  Baked for 30 min.   Cutting things up ahead of time made things easier too. I'll definitely make this again.

We really liked the flavor.  It's a good use for turkey, and it's low carb, but the lack of a binder made the dish kind of messy on the plate.  The first cut made the contents scatter.  I did not add the zucchini, and honestly, I can't see how I could have gotten all the stuffing ingredients into only 4 peppers, and mine were not small peppers.  I used a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes, and it was a good choice.  I could see this with more sauce over zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash, rather than inside a pepper.  Again, we did enjoy the flavor--a lot of our favorites were in the dish, and we hardly noticed we were eating ground turkey.  Thanks!

I cant speak for the exact recipe but the idea gets 5 stars. We added taco seasoning to the turkey, and used mushrooms, celery, spinach and chopped peppers for the veggies. Covered the empty peppers in foil and put in the oven according to the recipe, but not sure how long and it didnt seem to make a huge difference. Piled the filling into the peppers alternating scoops and cheese, finishing with cheese on top. Put them back in the oven uncovered for about 15 min or less, just until the cheese was bubbly. They were very tasty! I also added some garlic and onion powder to the veg while it cooked. My husband put hot sauce on it, like everything, and loved them. We ate the leftover mixture in a tortilla and still good! Thanks!

I added crushed red pepper and one spicy Italian sausage since we like our food with some zing.  Next time I will cut them in half and stuff each half. We had a lot of stuffing left over.  It was a delicious meal!

This is my first time writing a review on a recipe and I felt compelled because this was absolutely delicious!! What I love about this recipe is that you can add whatever healthy veggies you have around! I personally added: lean ground turkey, canned corn, mushrooms, spinach, onions, squash, canned tomatoes and about half a jar of leftover tomato basil sauce I had in the fridge. But this recipe would be great with just about whatever you had laying around. It is very versatile.  I made sure to season the turkey and vegetables very well while they were cooking. It was a huge hit! I will definitely be making this one again soon :)

This was my first attempt at Stuffed Bell Peppers and I was happy to find this recipe. The only changes I made were that I used Red, Yellow, and Orange bell peppers instead, I added some Worcestershire sauce to the meat and I used Cajun seasoning instead of Italian Seasoning. It turned out delicious!

Nice change from the traditional beef stuffed peppers with rice.  I added a little chopped onion to the veggie mix.  Didn't pre-cook the peppers just added the turkey/veggie mix and put them in the oven for 30  minutes.  Turned out great!

I have been looking for a go to stuffed peppers recipe and I liked this one.  I basically did as is but used the veggies I had on hand which is nice that you can make this dish with whatever you have.  I added more spices because I know how bland turkey can be.  I added a bit of tomato sauce on the top at the end before the final baking and when it was done fresh parmesan went on top.  It was good and filling and no other sides needed.  I will definitely try this again.

It is a good basic recipe and just needs some rice to absorb the extra water from the veggie mix.  You need to spice generously otherwise it can be bland.

Really good flavor. I  added chopped up all natural chicken,hot pepper  meatballs and left out the Italian seasoning. I would also use this for breakfast and put an egg on top.

Big hit! My husband rarely eat vegetables, so watching him scarf this down was heavenly. Mjy prep time took a little longer because I'm not good at chopping food. Overall, great idea,

This was awesome! Tasted great and used up some of the squash, tomatoes and peppers from the garden.I didn't have any mushrooms so left them out. I used fresh tomatoes, just diced and added. For seasoning, used curry powder and garam masala. Also 1 big garlic clove. We really enjoyed this.

Fantastic and pretty, all with NO CHEESE! Baking time needs to increase to 25 minutes before filling and then 20-25 minutes after filling. Followed the recipe very close to how it was written. Didn't use spinach or the canned tomatoes. I used about 2/3 C MID's italian sausage flavored meat sauce + about 3T Pizza Sauce (sub'ing what I had in the fridge for the tomatoes I didn't have). I also used 3 green peppers and 20 multi-colored mini-peppers. We all loved the mini peppers. They were nearly bite sized and were great for appetizers. I cooked them with the tops cut off and seeded. Then after cooking, they slice very nicely through the middle, making beautiful little appetizers. Thanks for the aesthetically pleasing, non-cheesy stuffed pepper recipe. It's a keeper.

Will be used on a 30 day cut diet.  No need to wrap peppers in foil during initial bake.  Didn't add zucchini and used leftover spaghetti sauce (about 6 oz.) instead of tomato paste and diced tomatoes.  be sure to add a good amount of Italian seasoning and salt to give enough flavor.

Don't be shy... Give this a try!!!!

This was a starter idea for me to work with... I changed it up a bit and it turned out AWESOME!!! I used Red, Yellow, and Orange Peppers. Added 2 tablespoons of Garlic to the mixture and used 2 cans of Fire Roasted Tomatoes and a whole bag of Fresh Spinach Chopped... Then while filling the pepper I put a layer of the mixture then I put a layer of Ricotta Cheese and repeated until the peppers were full... I think the next time I make Lasagna I am going to use these same steps to make my filling and maybe do a meatloaf this way to... 

My Girlfriend said she never liked Stuffed Peppers... 
Now she loves them!!!

Made this tonight for dinner and loved it! Of course, I improvised--used Brussels sprouts instead of spinach and zucchini, and spaghetti sauce instead of the diced tomatoes and tomato paste--and it was tasty. I have enough for another batch of peppers (since I cooked up two pounds of turkey instead of the one it called for) which is an excellent problem to have!

Bland. I even added chopped garlic, red pepper flakes, and other seasonings. And yes, I seasoned the turkey while it cooked. No go.

This recipe is awesome and while I tweaked it to my personal taste by using red peppers, not draining the diced tomatoes and adding ketchup rather than tomato paste the orginal recipe is perfect I am sure.  It gives alot of room to add your own creativity...this is part of my rotation of best loved dishes and the fact it is low fat and low in WW points just makes it more perfect!!  I sometimes cook the peppers in slow cooker with pasta sauce for 6 hours on high...perfect!

Good low fat stuffing mixture, but I threw  in some jalapeño peppers to give it more of a kick. Didn't have a zucchini, so added more mushrooms and red peppers.  I never parboil my peppers if they are baking in the oven or slow cooker, so eliminated that step. Had enough for leftovers that I made into wraps, covered with some canned enchilada sauce and shredded cheddar , popped into the oven for about 25 minutes and had a completely different meal in just a few minutes. Will make many more times!

This is a great, healthy dish.  To make it even more delicious, use half a pound of ground turkey and half a pound of turkey sausage.  You can also top it with a little parmesan.  Really hits the italian "pasta" craving without having any pasta.

So very good!  Nice way to use up all the bell peppers and other veggies before they went to waste.  The only things I did differently was adding one spicy turkey sausage removed from its casing.  I needed to use that up too and using an Adobo Salad & Vegetable seasoning packet.  Will definitely make again and again.

We are always looking for healthy recipes that are full of flavor. This one truly delivers! I deviated just a little from the recipe as I prefer yellow peppers over green and we loved it. It was simple and easy to make and was absolutely delicious!!

This is a pretty flexible recipe. You can throw in what ever veggies you have on hand. One thing I would do differently is slice the peppers and bake them face down on a cookie sheet with a little bit of olive oil. Baking them in foil for 15 minutes wasn't long enough and didn't add any flavor. A similar recipe on this site is stuffed peppers my way. I would recommend cooking the peppers that way. Other than that, it's a keeper and healthy too.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The only change I made was getting the diced tomatoes that come already seasoned- the Italian option. It was yummy! I think it might be great to make with Italian sausage instead of the turkey as well, just maybe not as healthy... Will definitely make again!

I am rating this a 5 on a veggie version...the ground turkey i thought i had...i didn't ....so i upped the veg. Subbed yellow squash for yellow pepper and kept all other veggies the same. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and topped with a small amount of part skim mozzarella and a teenie drizzle of evoo. So good and healthy.  Will most definitely make again with extra lean ground turkey or chicken.  Thanks!

This was really yummy and great for lunch the next day. I'm not a fan of any kind of bell peppers, so I used pasilla peppers instead. Mmmm. I sauteed the onions first in some olive oil and when they were transluscent I added the turkey, then followed the recipe from there (set the turkey aside and cooked the rest of the veggies). I followed another reviewers idea of not pre-baking the peppers and just stuffed them with the filling, and put them in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. They turned out great! The only thing I was disappointed in was the turkey. Even with all the vegetables added to it, it was really bland and tasteless. My husband and I loved everything else though.

I added much more seasoning like others.  I couldn't stop eating it right out of the pan before I stuffed the peppers 'cause it was so good!

Yummy!!! Instead of tomatoes and paste I used a jar of chunky vegetable Ragu sauce. I will be making this dish again. So delicious but also healthy!

WOW. What an amazing dish! I used an entire onion, and cooked the turkey with italian seasoning/garlic salt/salt & pepper first. Make sure to over-season your turkey because the taste will die down after you add it to everything else! In the beginning, my turkey tasted WAY too salty (by itself) and I was definitely worried. However, after adding it to the veggie mix and adding the tomatoes/paste (2+ Tb of paste!) it tasted fantastic. I couldn't stop eating them even before putting it in the peppers... I also used red peppers because they looked prettier, but I think for next time I'll use green because red peppers ended up a bit too tangy for such a dish. When I was cooking the veggies, I also made sure that they were all fully cooked before putting the turkey back in.

I added a cup of brown rice and a jar of my favorite pasta sauce. As-is I thought it was a bit dry - stuffed peppers in my opinion should have a saucy filling. Very healthy and a good base recipe to make your own modifications.

This is a really great and healthy recipe. Even my 11 and 14 year olds and one of there friends all had seconds on this one. It is a great way to get veggies and the flavor is terrific! The only changes I made were to use red peppers for stuffing because I don't like green peppers. Also, I used a can of Italian style (pasta style) diced tomatoes and skipped the Italian seasoning instead of plain diced tomatoes with the seasoning. This will be a regular. Thanks!!

Very good, healthy ingredients. I had to add a lot of salt and a little cumin and fresh garlic to flavor it up a little bit (I like my food salty). Turkey is a great, lean alternative to beef or pork. Will definitely try again!

Yummy!  My husband said these are the first stuffed peppers he's ever eaten that tasted as good as they smell!  I did make a few small changes - I subbed canned corn for zucchini, I used Rotel instead of diced tomatoes, I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and I added about 3/4 cup of prepared spaghetti sauce.  We loved these and will be making them often!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect! We used large red peppers from a local farm stand for the filling, instead of green peppers, and it was gorgeous. We will make this one again and again. Thank you for the wonderful recipe !

I didn't use spinach but followed the rest of the recipe to the T. The peppers were still hard after the initial 15 minutes of baking so I spread olive oil across the skins for the second baking and this softened them up a little, but were still a tad too hard to bite into when finished. The peppers were very wet inside and quite bland. I would recommend adding some cheese to the mixture to help hold to peppers together and some spice to give it some taste. Better luck to others!

These peppers are fantastic.  I used turkey Italian sausage instaed of just ground turkey.  I  also added Italian seasoning.  I didn't precook the peppers.  I just stuffed them, put the remaining sauce in the bottom of the pan, covered with foil and baked at 350 for 40 min.  GREAT

About 5 years ago, an acquaintance gave me a recipe similiar to this that was absolutely to die for.  Well, 2 moves later, I lost it, and have been trying to recreate it for years.  This is ALMOST as good as that old one!  First, I steamed the peppers for about 3 minutes instead of baking - they turned out perfect tenderness.  I ommitted the spinach and mushrooms, and reserved the juice from the tomatoes.  I combined all ingredients (except peppers to be stuffed), and added tomato juice (with added water, enough to make a full 1 cup) and brought to a boil.  Then, I added 1 cup Couscous and removed from heat for 5 minutes. After filling, I topped with a pinch of Mozzarella cheese before baking.  Turned out GREAT!!

Quite delicious! I followed the advice of a few others and didn't bother pre-cooking the peppers. I think I only ended up cooking them for about 30 minutes total, so the peppers came out kinda crunchy. I liked this, since I've made stuffed peppers before and they were kinda mushy, but I guess its all about what you prefer. I also used lean, mild turkey sausage, and a little bit of feta on top during the last few minutes of baking - both added great flavor. I'll be making these again.

These were good, just not the best stuffed peppers I have ever had.  I like my peppers saucy.  I added a can of tomato soup in lieu of the paste, thinking it would do the job, but the filling was still not where I would like it to be.  I will make again, but have marinara ready to pour on top and around the peppers while cooking.

We loved this recipe! Very delicious and healthy too. The only things I did differently were, I seasoned the ground turkey while I was browning it - I used oregano, garlic powder and black pepper (since we like things a little spicy). I will definitely make these again - I will cook the peppers a little longer next time, they were a bit al dente but still, delicous! Thank you for sharing :)

Pretty good. Although when we initially baked the green peppers they produced quite a bit of water. We drained them before stuffing them but again a lot of water was produced. I think the water really saturated the flavors so the dish was lacking a bit. I did follow other reviews and sauteed garlic & onion with the turkey. Also added a lot of crushed red pepper.

First recipe I've ever liked that I've made using ground turkey, and I'll be making it again often.  I like that it will freeze well, as I live alone and it's a challenge to find things this good that do.

This was VERY good and so healthy unlike the old version with the rice and hamburger!! We wanted something different and these were so good. Next time I make them which I for sure will be doing, I will add something for a little more spice. (Maybe the Rotel like the other review)?! But otherwise I added everything else as the recipes states. Also I chopped up the veggies in a food processor but next time I will just hand dice because they were to small and I think bigger bites would be better. All of my co-workers loved the recipe to and had to have a copy!

Very good!  My husband and I loved this dish.  After reading the reviews, I did season the meat with Italian Seasoning and 3 cloves crushed garlic, and a bit of red pepper flakes while it was cooking, as well as added the onion to cook with the meat.  For the veggies, I used the tops of the green peppers instead of yellow and red peppers, 2 cups spinach, 1 1/2 c. of mushrooms, some frozen corn and skipped the zucchini.  I substituted a can of Rotel instead of the diced tomatoes for some added zing.  I served with rice.  Will definitely be making this again.

I thought this receipe was great! i used red peppers & tomato sauce instead of paste. Cooking time was exactly perfect! i added a little bit of cheese & a drizzle of tomato sauce on the top of each pepper at the end and turned the broiler on for about 3-5 mins until cheese was browned & bubbly. i also left out the spinach & used carrots instead.

Very Good. I would saute fresh garlic with the veggies, and at least double the amount of spinach.  Some diced broccoli would also be a nice addition. Easy to make, healthy & delicious.

We enjoyed this dish and will make it again. YUM! I prepared it as a casserole with some cheese sprinkled on top. After doing the skillet cooking, I put it into a casserole dish - 350 degree oven for 15 min & then sprinkled the  top with cheese.  I did not drain the can of diced tomatoes. I used fresh garlic, dashes of Tabasco and when  browning the turkey used Worchestershire Sauce. I, also, added one small can of tomato paste.  Lots and Lots of Veggies: 3 LARGE diced peppers  2 cups of fresh spinach 1 LARGE diced onion 1 LARGE diced zuchhini  Truly a delicious and healthy dish!

These were OK.  We used fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder and added some red pepper flakes for kick. I also stuffed some cheese in the top of each pepper after stuffing.  It seemed like the green pepper itself was still a little too raw at these cooking times.  Next time we will cook it longer and maybe switch to another color bell pepper.  The taste of the filling was good though.

This was delicious. I only used one tablespoon of olive oil, though, and it worked out great. I also cooked the peppers about 25 minutes initially, instead of 15 because I like the skin to be more "well-done."

A very good low fat recipe! I added Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic, salt and pepper to the meat while it cooked to give it a bit more flavour. I added parmesan cheese to the mixture before I stuffed the peppers which really helped give it a flavour boost.I also followed the advice of another reviewer and put pasta sauce on top and around the peppers while they baked and then served it with spaghetti.

Loved it! Except I didn't follow the ingredients. My boyfriend and I just moved into a new apartment so we were low on money. I added frozen veggies (onions, peppers, celery) and seasoned those with the turkey. My boyfriend loves spicy foods so I subbed Rotel for the diced tomatoes and added some red pepper. I also added some seasoned cooked rice to the mix and kept the spinach from the original. I also used yellow peppers because I don't like green peppers as much. I also topped the pepper with some spaghetti sauce (spicy) and sprinkled it with Mexican cheese and Italian seasoning before putting the peppers back into the oven for the second time. My bf has never had stuffed peppers and LOVED it. We will be making it again soon!!

These are great! Nice and healthy. I put it over some brown rice and it's really nice to chop up the bell pepper and mix up everything with rice. Yum.

I didn't have mushrooms or zucchini, so I added carrots. I did have a jar of roasted red peppers- yum. My husband loves roasted garlic, so I threw that in instead of garlic powder. Excellent recipe!

I made this last night, and my partner raved about and said it so far is one of the best dishes I've made so far. The only thing I would do differently next time is add a little chipotle or jalapeno to give it a tiny kick. But it's still a fantastic tasting recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I usually add a little more spices than it calls for such as basil and oregano. Also a little bit of shredded Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. This is a tasty, healthy meal sure to please everyone in the family!

Shortly and sweetly, this is so good!  I agree that cooking the peppers in water was better than using the oven. Much better.

thanks so much! we are on the SBDiet and looking for a low carb solution to stuffed peppers! These were delicious, however I did make a couple minor tweeks...lean, lean ground beef browned with garlic powder (I drained and blotted). 1/2 can of black beans (rinsed) and low fat parmesan cheese. yum, yum, yum, I will definately make these again!!!

Really good. I added real chopped garlic w/ the onion instead of garlic powder. Very hearty and healthy. Served with orzo and was perfect. Oh, and a tip- chop everything beforehand, it got really rushed. Will def make again, just with more prep

I love this recipe, it is the same one my grandmother and mom use to make when  I was a little girl. I use less sugar and I like to add a can of mexicorn for more color and flavor. However, the recipe is great without any additions or changes.

These came out awesome.  I added fresh crushed garlic (rather than the garlic powder) and the salt and pepper while cooking the ground turkey.  These go great with steamed brown rice.

Wow!!! The filling is delicious. I hull zuchinis and tomatoes, add their insides and stuff them with the finished product instead of peppers. It makes a very healthy, fancy, and easy first course (if I can keep my family from eating them before dinner).

Pretty tasty...it's too hot here for the oven so I steamed the peppers before stuffing and then, once stuffed, put a little parmesan on top and put them under the broiler for about 7 minutes to heat up and crisp. If you added extra tomatos, this would be an excellent pasta sauce.

What a great, fresh recipe! Guiltless too! I have never made suffed peppers before, and my boyfriend loved these.  This recipe is easy to play around with; I threw in some minced garlic and crushed red pepper for a little zing. I also simplified things by buying a bag of frozen chopped red & yellow peppers & onions. They worked great!  I served these up with some angel hair pasta parmesan on the side for a tasty meal.  Thanks!

Excellent flavor!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Used a generous amount of Italian seasoning and garlic salt.  If you didn't want to stuff green peppers, the veggie/turkey mixture would also be good with rice for a stir fry type dish.

This was my first time ever making stuffed peppers. I followed the modifications that were in the "most helpful" review left by Michelle K. I took the peppers out a couple of minutes early to add cheese and placed them back in the oven to melt. So good. Saved this recipe to make it gain! :)

I added a little jalepeno to add a little heat to the turkey stuffing for the Bell Pepper.  It was very tasty and not bland at all.  Great Recipe because you can tweak it to your own tastes.

This was a great tasting, quick & delicious low fat, cholesterol & sodium meal! The only sub I made was fresh garlic to veggies & served w/a wild rice side. So good- thanks to the creator!

I did not put spinach in mine. Also, instead of putting tomato paste in mine, I ate is a roasted garlic pasta sauce! These turned out absolutely amazing :-)

Recipe was really good I added black beans and just used the tops of peppers as colored peppers are  too expensive. I did not pre cook the peppers either. Just cooked them a bit longer.

I didn't have mushrooms or canned tomato or tomato paste.  I just omitted the mushrooms, and used fresh tomatoes and it was still very tasty!

I made a veggie version using this recipe as the base...turned out great!    Stuffing mix:  Cook 3 large green onion stalks (save a little for garnish), 2 garlic cloves, half yellow bell pepper, 1/3 zucchini, handful baby spinach, 1 small tomato, 1/2 can blk beans, 1/8th cup cooked quinoa, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, oregano, dried basil, 2-3 large spoons tomato sauce, and 1/2 cup veggie broth added at the end. Tomato sauce: Mix garlic powder, black pepper, Italian seasoning, 1/2 can tomato sauce. Use 2 whole green bell peppers (cut in halves). Brush olive oil, salt, pepper on bell pepper halves. Pour tomato sauce on bottom of tray. Arrange bell peppers in tray, bake at 400F for 15 min. Then fill mix into bell pepper halves and top each with spoonful of tomato sauce, bake additional 30 min. Optional garnish with cheese and green onions.

This is a great healthier alternative!  My family really liked turkey compared to hamburger meat of traditional recipe.  I added a little more salt and pepper for my taste but this is a recipe I would recommend!

love this recipe! I actually dont stuff it into peppers. I eat the stuffing plain or with crackers, like a chili. Not the fanciest presentation for it, but it is healthy and easy to make. Have made it several times this way.

If you do stuff the peppers, though, make sure you boil them for a couple minutes before baking. otherwise they are WAY too undercooked.

As is, this recipe just doesn't work for me.  I followed it almost  to the letter & the results were not as expected.  Baking the peppers yielded them too firm/raw for our needs so I boiled them a bit like I do for beef/rice stuffed peppers.  I added much more seasoning than that specified.  The final product was dry, dry, dry.  Too bad I didn't read the reviews first but I think adding marinara sauce to bake them would help a lot.  Not a keeper; I'll stick to the beef & rice version.

This turned out very bland. I added crushed red pepper, salsa, and some sweet chili sauce which improved it significantly.

I made this several times,  I chopped up fresh jalapenos instead of mushroom and no stewed tomatoes. Also I made some jasmine rice and added a little to the mixture and topped with cheese in the oven. I do something different each time but this is a good base recipe! Oh and I cut the peppers  in half like a boat so the kids can eat them easier.

I left out the zucchini and mushrooms,  and added salsa instead of tomato paste/canned tomatoes. Delish. My hubby will even have it again. (That's huge)

This was the 1st time I made stuffed peppers using turkey (usually I use ground lamb). My son, who does not eat red meat, loved these peppers. My hisband and I thought they were okay but rather bland tasting. Also, the pepper stayed crunchy even after baking the recipe’s 30 minutes plus an additional 15 minutes. Next time I think I would mix in some grated cheese or somthing else to give the stuffing more flavor.

Added red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese,   garlic clove and used the tops of the peppers instead of adding more peppers.  Next time I’ll add some cayenne or hot pepper sauce to spice them even more! Also, didn’t use mushrooms as a DS dislikes them. Served with mashed potatoes, asparagus, and lettuce salad with blueberries and apples. One flavorful dish!

I was looking for a basic Keto friendly recipe for stuffed peppers and came across this one. Used zucchini and bell peppers from the garden, a volunteer puff ball mushroom from the yard, a hand full of basil from the herb garden, an onion, a sprinkle of chili powder and another of ground cumin (to disguise the ground beef flavor; didn't have any ground turkey).  Added some awesome fresh tomato marinara from this website.  I stuffed the whole peppers really tight, laid them flat in a pan and poached them.  Served with grated cheddar over top.  Great recipe!

My husband said he prefers ground beef stuffed peppers and I don't need to make this again.  I've cooked ground turkey recipes before to reduce saturated fats, but this recipe didn't disguise the taste enough for either one of us.

I made it as is and added tomato basil pasta sauce instead of paste. It looks so good and tastes great!

A little dry, added herbed tomato sauce to casserole dish before baking and this helped. Would make it again. Good texture and variety of veggies that you could easil modify.

I put a little bit of hot pepper in the mix.  Replaced zucchini with leftover grilled cauliflower- it was terrific!

I mixed the turkey meat with hot and sweet Italian sausage. Didn't bother with the spinach, it seemed insignificant in this recipe. It needed a lot more cooking time then the recipe said. Overall it tasted good, just needs more cooking time.

I liked the heavy vegetable mixture of this recipe, but could tell from the lack of spices that this might be bland so I added cumin to the olive oil before browning the turkey. I also added one clove of raw chopped garlic in addition to the garlic powder. I used quite a bit of dried oregano in this instead of Italian seasonings because I didn't have them. I also added crumbled feta.

This recipe will need some substitutions. I made it as is and it was very bland. I will be searching for another resume and don't believe I will make it again.

Never used ground turkey but after making this I don't think I will ever used ground beef again! This was the most amazing dish I've made. We skipped the spinach because we forgot to buy some other then that had ever thing else on hand and didn't even miss the cheese which I normally topped stuffed peppers with. Outstanding!!!

I blanched the peppers for 10 minutes first and used tri-color peppers instead of green.  I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  I added a 1/2 cup Italian grated cheese in the meat mixture and sprinkled cheese on top before baking.  Also added 1/2 can fire roasted tomatoes to the meat mixture and  mixed 8 oz. of canned tomato sauce to the rest of the fire roasted tomatoes and spread on the bottom of the casserole before placing the filled peppers on top.  It was excellent.  Everyone wants me to make this again.

I was making this for company, so I made the stuffing ahead of time, and then just cooked, then stuffed the peppers at dinner time   It took about 30 min to bake after stuffed, but was much easier and allowed time to visit with my guests.

This was a phenomenal recipe. I didn't change a thing, besides chopping the mushrooms and seasoning the turkey as it cooked to add some flavor. I will keep this one for years!

Amazing! Will be making this again. The only things we did different we used rotel instead of the can of diced tomatoes, and we used fresh garlic instead of powdered garlic.

I used a red, green and a yellow pepper cut in half. I also used tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes. I boiled the peppers in salted water for 3 minutes before stuffing them. I baked these for 30 minutes covered, then removed them, added cheese and baked for another 15 minutes. Thanks for the recipe:)

Finally, my family all agreed that this was a great recipe!  I replaced the diced tomatoes and tomato paste with organic marinara sauce.   I think it gave it a nice flavor.  Regular tomato sauce would work too.  I didn't like the thought of using only one tablespoon of the tomato paste.  What was I supposed to do with the rest of the can?

Made the recipe exactly as described except I added red pepper flakes to the turkey and the vegetable mixture during cooking. With 15 min. of pre-baking and 15 min. of actual baking, the green peppers were still really crunchy and I wonder if you shouldn't leave them in for just a few minutes longer. I will probably make it again since it was a relatively cheap, easy, and healthy meal. Next time I'll add more spices and probably some cheese.

Very tasty. Made with 1/2 turkey sausage & 1/2 ground turkey. Cut the peppers in half and microwaved them for a short time to precook before filling them.  Added some cayenne pepper to veg/meat filling. And surrounded the filled 1/2 peppers with herb enhanced tomato sauce and topped with grated Parmesan cheese. Covered them when baking to hold moisture in.

A very versatile recipe that I make weekly.  As other users suggested I add red pepper flakes, basil, oregano.  I add all spices to meat when cooking. I use zucchini and red peppers Bc that is what I like. I make it as a taco filling and use leftovers on a salad with feta. Great light calorie meal

Really great alternative to the usual beef and rice peppers! Even my 5 year old LOVED it (despite the cacophony of veggies)! Only thing I did different was to add some garlic salt and used fire roasted diced tomatoes. I may never make them the old way again...

These were absolutely delicious and super easy to make. I followed what one person said about not adding extra peppers, but using the tops of the green peppers instead, as well as instead of using diced tomatoes I had extra salsa in the fridge and used that. It added a kick of spice and was just what the stuffing needed. I also cooked rice and added it into the mixture as well. With the rice, there was more stuffing than needed to stuff the peppers but overall it was an amazing choice.

Perfect recipe - easy to make, calls for fresh ingredients, and is deliciously satisfying. I paired the peppers with pasta, using the contents of the peppers as the sauce. Perfect way to end the day, with lots of leftovers to boot!

Very delicious with lean (not extra lean) turkey, all the vegetables and lots of seasonings. I used two halves of a squash and two bell peppers and added a bit of fresh mozzarella on top. The peppers and squash took longer to bake then written. Maybe you need to wrap them tightly, individually. Very tasty!

The kids and husband said this recipe is a "keeper"! The only thing I did differently was I added 1lbs of hot turkey sausage and doubled up the recipe, I only used the tops and bottoms of my peppers (it was plenty) to the meat and sauce plus the other veggies. Also I just baked it for 40 mins rather then 15 before and after. Added mozzarella the last 5 mins to the tops.

Great recipe for cutting calories. I didn't have tomato paste so I added a bit of basil and oregano tomato sauce before I put them in the oven and added about a tablespoon of parmesan when they were baking. I appreciated all the vegetables...super healthy and the taste was good.

Loved it. The only change I'll add next time is to drizzle tomato sauce over the peppers at the end of cooking to keep it from drying out.

I loved them! I tweaked the recipe a little. I used no tomato paste, and no cheese as alot of people had on their pictures. MY boyfriend who is usually very picky liked them and requested that I make them again!

Was not spicy enough, that's easy to improve.  Make sure that the green peppers are soft before putting the filling in.  I found that 15 minutes in foil was not enough.  The filling was extremely tasty though.

This is such a wonderful healthy meal! The only things I did differently was I used red peppers, I used ground elk instead of turkey, and I topped each with a little parmesan cheese. Not only did my husband and I love it, but my kids did too! What a great way to get your protein and veggies!

This recipe can be very good when I add all the adjustments I make. However I am rating this recipe based on recipe alone. I found this recipe to be bland, so I add a LOT of tomato paste, and a lot of seasoning. I taste as I go and keep adding more seasoning until it's good (garlic powder, season salt, Italian seasoning, cracked pepper, a little garlic salt) Also, I leave out the chopped bell pepper as I think it's a little overkill as its stuffed inside bell peppers already. Instead I just add spinach and sautéed chopped onion. I add a little cheddar cheese on top of each stuffed bell pepper. I don't bother to bake the peppers before stuffing them as my husband likes the bell peppers not to be too squishy .. A little soft crunch. With the added extra tomato paste and seasonings and cheese this is 4.5 stars.

This was great!  Even my husband loved it!  I made the mistake of only cooking the peppers for ten minutes ahead of time, so they were a little crunchy.  The turkey could have used a little more seasoning, but besides that, I loved this recipe!  Will definitely be making it again.

Loved the turkey mix recipe, however the green peppers needed to stay in the oven longer than the initial 15 minutes to get softer. I'll make it again though

These were quite good, full of flavor, and didn't make me miss the cheese one bit. Although I was surprised to find that I missed the traditional rice element a bit, these were delicious in their own rite. There was definitely some stuffing left over, so next time I will use the pepper tops instead of the extra pepper. I agree with the other reviewers that the turkey needs a hefty helping of that "Italian seasoning to taste" cooked into it when sauteing. I also agree some tomato sauce would have given these the extra sauciness they needed. As written, still very tasty, but with a few changes, could definitely be an excellent, 5-star recipe.

Definitely a good idea!! I cooked the ground turkey and veggies together. But instead of all the veggies they have listed I used onions fresh tomatoes green onions the tops of the peppers and kale. Added a little olive oil and used salsa instead of canned tomatoes n paste..  Put provolone cheese on top.. Came out amazing

This recipe turned out perfect.  I followed one of the reviews that included the Ragu's Super vegetable sauce.  I also followed the advice not to put the peppers in the oven first.  I'd suggest putting the peppers in the oven first.  Otherwise everything was perfect, I am no chef but I received complements on this meal.  It was easy to make, and delicious.

I enjoyed this and followed the recipe exactly. It needed a little more flavor and I had enough filling to stuff 5 peppers. In the future I will probably add some jalapenos and garlic for a little more kick.

This was very good, I didn't add any extra bell pepper, I did add 1/4 cup quinoa and 1/4 cup rice into the mixture. Turned out better than the recipe I usually use. Thanks!

Our favorite stuffed pepper recipe to date!  If you don't like stuffed peppers cooked in tomato sauce, you'll love this recipe.  Like most reviewers, I changed this up a bit by using double the amount of mushrooms and onions then didn't add the eggplant (the store was out).  I also didn't measure the spinach, just added a very healthy handful and about a heaping tablespoon of Italian seasoning blend.  We like our peppers with quite a bit of crunch and didn't cook them beforehand.  I made them a few hours before dinner and refrigerated them until time to cook, which took about 50 minutes.  Because I had tomatoes to use, I topped each pepper half with a slice of tomato prior to baking. This is a very versatile recipe and easy to change based on your family's preferences. We will definitely have again.

This was amazing! It says that it makes 4 servings..but it really depends on the size of the pepper. Our batch  made enough for 7 peppers! Super cheap, easy, and healthy! Thanks for an awesome recipe. My husband said that these were the best stuffed peppers he's ever eaten! Even our little baby loved them.

Filling was tasty but the recipe reminded me why I don't make stuffed pepper anymore as the pepper is rarely cooked enough.

This recipe was so easy and yummy! I added a slice of cheese to the top of my peppers after they cooked in the oven. The cheese melted on the top and made it taste so good. I followed the recipe just the way it is besides the cheese added. Will def make this again!

This is a fantastic recipe!! You can get so creative with it and make it your own. I add some different seasoning and then at the very end I add a cheeseey bread crumb topping to each pepper for a crunch. I do panko crumbs mixed with melted butter (( enough butter to turn the crumbs yellow)) and I place that on top of each pepper with some shredded cheese I've done cheddar and parmasean Romano in the past. Soooo good gives it a crunch and extra depth of flavor!!!

Excellent. Didn't cook the peppers ahead of time. Just increased cooking time to 40 min. Added some parmesan cheese. Definitely a keeper.

Ok, but I wouldn't make it again.  We found the pepper's themselves to detract from the filling.  We also didn't find it necessary to add peppers to a filling that was being stuffed in a pepper.

What a delicious recipe! I wanted a stuffed pepper that didn't have rice. This fit the bill. I didn't have spinach, but instead added a can of mixed vegetables that had little potatoes in it (the type you might use for pot pie). Believe it or not, it tasted amazing! I pretty much followed the recipe. I used yellow, read and orange peppers...super!
I added the tomato paste the recipe called for and I also added one fresh,cubed tomato and about 1 cup of Ragu tomato sauce I had left from a quickie meal last night. Instead of placing them in the over, I used my Ninja cooker. The peppers were done in 20 minutes!

I did not cook the peppers prior to filling, I just stuffed them and cooked them for about 30 minutes and they came out great.  Great recipe and easy to make, thanks!

This recipe was easy, quick to make.  I found the outer pepper too crispy, would probably cook it longer alone next time. But my husband thought the crispiness was a nice touch. I think next time we will throw in a little extra tomato paste. Also we added cheese and next time are going to try adding jalapenos. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  I'll def. be making this again!  The only thing I did differently was added fresh garlic to the turkey while browning it in the skillet and added shredded cheese to the top just before pulling them out of the oven.  I served these with rice!

Dry. Tasteless. The pepper didn't cook- it was like eating an entire whole raw pepper. My friend said you have to boil them for 7 min. before stuffing them, but I would never use this stuffing again.

I scaled this down to two portions and the filling was still entirely too much so we just ate the rest on the side.  It was very good.

I really liked this recipe. It was super easy and quick to make. I had extra stuffing left over so next time I will make sure that I buy large bell peppers. I added some shredded parmesan to the tops when I baked them and it was a great healthy meal. If you don't mind the extra calories, it would be really good toadd parmensan cheese to the mixture before stuffing and grate a little on the top.

These are the best stuffed peppers I have ever eaten. I love the fact that they're so healthy and yummy! I didn't change the recipe at all.

In trying to eat healthier I tried this recipe as well as ground turkey for the first time.  Used 97% fat free turkey.  While browning the turkey I seasoned with fresh cracked pepper and kosher salt.  Came out great!  I didn't precook my peppers to cut out some time and it was just fine. Baked for about 45 minutes then topped with a touch of low fat shredded cheese.  Baked an additional 10 minutes and then we devoured.  Very tasty!

Yummy!  I did not have turkey so I substituted extra veggies and it was just as good.  I ended up with a lot of the stuff (probably becuase the green peppers were sort of small) so I put that in a small baking dish layered alternately with cheese and that was yummy too.

Great healthy recipe. Careful about which turkey you choose--extra lean can dry out really easily. Also, don't be afraid to amp up the spices.

This was really good!!  I used italian seasoned turkey sausage, no spinach, and put tomato sauce on top and in the pan using red peppers.  I think this filling would be good on rice or noodles, which I will try sometime.

I made these using nice sweet red bell peppers and ground chicken in place of ground turkey.  I also added a few chopped jalapeno chilies and some sweet peas to the recipe.  The results were outstanding.  A great recipe for stuffed peppers that I would highly recommend.  These are delicious!

Wonderful! I used cabbage instead of spinach (because it's what I had on hand), and I dont' know if I will like the spinach better. The cabbage made it reminiscent of a cabbage roll with the ground meat and tomato flavor. Husband asked me to put this in our regular rotation. My only negative about the recipe is that the proportions were off. I could have used 5 peppers.

These were okay but I think if I make them I will add a little more tomato paste and maybe a chopped jalapeno, the turkey mixture seemed to be missing something for us. I stuck with the recipe on everything except I did not use the extra bell pepper or the mushrooms (we don't like mushrooms) in the turkey mixture. With a few adjustments for my households tastes we might be willing to try this again.

I gave this a 3 only because my peppers never really cooked, they were still kinda raw.  I like mine soft and a little browned.  The stuffing was really good and I would make that just on it's own.

This was a really great recipe.  It's not the best thing I've ever tasted, but it's probably the best thing I've tasted that is this healthy.  I made a few modifications: I cooked the peppers for 10 extra minutes before filling.  I left out garlic powder but added oregano and celery salt.  I added a diced yellow squash.  The yellow squash is perfect if you need to play hide-the-veggies from the spouse or kids, because the yellow squash takes on the color of the ground turkey as it absorbs juices and sort of hides visually.  I left out mushrooms because I hate them.  I used more tomato sauce (instead of paste, which I didn't have on hand) because I thought it needed more moisture, but that may just be because I overcooked the turkey a little.  Also, I had these tiny little sweet peppers that I found at my local warehouse club, so I filled some of those and put them around the big peppers.  I'm going to upload my photo, because I think it turned out very visually appealing in addition to tasting great.

Very good recipe! The only issue was that the peppers were a bit too firm after only two 15 minute intervals in the oven. I think that cooking them longer would make this perfect.

I changed a couple things...  First...I didn't pre-bake my peppers.  After I stuffed them, I just baked them for the time listed, and they came out just fine. Second...I omitted the red bell pepper.  I made this with the Savory Herb Rice also found on this site...and they complimented each other perfectly.  Very tasty.

Will make again! I actually used this recipe when having a dinner party and I ran short on veggies so I used more meat and added box stuffing and mozzarella cheese so that I would have enough filling. The stuffing was great since some people didn't like a lot of  veggies.

I was excited to try this variation on an existing favorite and made made this recipe as printed. Unfortunately, my fiance and I were disappointed with the lack of flavor, although they did taste a little better the second day. Perhaps I will try again and use more seasoning and some tomato sauce.

Since I am not a fan of green pepper, I used yellow & orange. I also diced fresh basil and added that to the diced tomato sauce. This is one of the best recipes I have made from this site! I am on Weight Watchers & one pepper is only 7 points. Very Healthy & GREAT tasting.

These were delicious and so healthy! I didn't have turkey on hand so I used hamburg instead. I also added two cans of diced tomatoes instead of just one, more mushrooms than what was called for, another tablespoon of tomato paste, and sprinkled a little bit of Monterey Jack on top. They came out great! I will definitely be making these again and again and will be experimenting with adding other varieties of veggies to them. Yum!

This was sooooooo good. I was eating the stuffing out of the pan while the peppers were cooking.  I sauted onions and fresh garlic in extra virgin olive oil with the turkey and spices, and it came out very flavorful.  I also added the spices separately to the vegetables for extra oomph.  So delicious!

This is simply a fabulous recipe - I went heavy on the Italian Seasoning, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper, and then added some Cayenne Pepper for a kick.  Yummy!

I did add some paprika, basil and oregano to this mix.  I also threw in a little mozzarella cheese because I personally think everything tastes better with cheese!  Overall, though, I've been looking for a stuffed pepper recipe that didn't call for rice, so I was excited to find this and I thought it was FANTASTIC.  My husband said it could have used a little "more spice"...maybe I'll try a little chili powder next time.

To cook in a crockpot - I microwaved the peppers for 7 mins, then stuffed them, then put them in the crockpot on low for 3 hours. Very easy.  Next time I'll add shredded cheese and red pepper.  Good, healthy recipe.

I made this as a casserole and my family loved it.  I added extra seasonings (I always do) :)  The flavors were delicious.  This will go into rotation.  Quick and easy.

Very versatile recipe.  Made many modifications, including using venison instead of turkey, no mushrooms, tomato juice instead of paste, added fresh hot peppers.  Liked it - will try with other modifications as well.  Thanks

I wanted to use the huge amount of vegetables coming from my garden, so I used 2 large tomatoes diced instead of canned tomatoes. I cooked them with the other veggies to soften them up.  I also used yellow summer squash instead of zucchini and it was a colorful addition.

I really liked this but my husband didn't care for it.  He said it might be better with ground beef rather than turkey.  Instead of baking the green peppers, I put them in boiling water for about 10 min and then filled them with the turkey/vegetables and baked them for 15min. Thanks for the recipe!

These tasted pretty good for being as healthy as they are but I think next time we will stick with our regular stuffed peppers recipe made with rice and beef.

Loved this, just thought the peppers should cook a little longer than the recipe states to soften them.

I didn't quite understand putting the bellpeppers in the stuffing- the outer pepper was more than enough pepper flavor for me, so I took out the extra. Try adding some cooked white rice to the stuffing!

I didn't have zucchini so I omitted it. Also didn't have ground turkey so I used ground beef. I added a few more spices as I always do, and it was very yummy!

These peppers are the BEST!  This is now the second time I have made them.  The first time I made the recipe as stated (with the exception of adding red pepper flakes).  The second time I added a handful of fresh chopped basil and in my opinion this addition makes it even better!

Beautiful color, and yummy!  This would be a beautiful dish for a party or potluck.  Made exactly as written except with lean ground beef (only because the store was out of turkey).  Also instead of Italian spices, used Southwestern spices: black & red pepper blend & cumin.  Served with rice.  Recipe makes a lot of filling--I would guess it's designed to fill 4 LARGE peppers.  If your peppers are just average, there's enough to stuff 5 or 6.  No matter, the filling is fresh and tasty enough to eat plain on rice or by the spoonful :).

This was a great change from normal stuffed peppers & so much healthier. The filling makes a lot of extra but I guess its depends on the size of your peppers. I used 5 normal sized green peppers & still had enough left to make 2 more. I topped with just a little bit of fresh grated parm before eating and it was divine. I also used italian flavored ground turkey for a little extra flavor. Terrific filling a healthy meal.

The turkey didn't have a ton of flavor, but I would just saute some garlic and onions for awhile with the it instead of adding all the spices after it's done cooking. Other than that, a great, quick recipe!

I'd never had "regular" stuffed peppers, but thought this recipe looked healthy and fresh.  It was okay, but the pepper flavor is too overwhelming for me (I don't like green peppers plain.)

This recipe was absolutely amazing! We had some seasoned chicken sausage that my boyfriend had bought that needed to be used up, so I substituted that for the turkey. It added a nice touch, but I had to use extra veggies, which was fine!  I added some mozzarella to the tops of each pepper, as well. It added a nice touch.  Excellent recipe, healthy and delicious!

This is YUMMY! I somehow forgot the tomato products and they turnd out just great!  The peppers didn't stay together very well when eating, but I think it was because of the missing moisture from the tomato.  I am trying it again tonight, with the tomoato.  I'm sure it will be great

My husband and I really loved this recipe. I don't like cooked whole peppers so I just eat the inside.  I thought this was really tasty.  The next time I make it I am going to omit the whole peppers and serve it over rice.  I boiled my peppers instead of baking them and I used frozen spinch since I had it in the freezer.

Super yummy and easy. The peppers do need to cook longer because they were still a little too hard. Overall, they were excellent. The only modification I made was too add cheese to the peppers about 10 minutes before I pulled them out of the oven.

Added plenty of garlic, Italian seasoning, and S&P and still found this to be a bit bland. I added a bunch of asiago cheese to the mix and it was much better.

Good recipe for a change from more traditional style stuffed peppers. However, I think the peppers need to be cooked longer as they were still a little bit crunchy.  I didnt have italian seasonings so I added my own.  One ingredient that I added was just a little bit of rosemary, it was way too over powering. Will not add that next time.

I thought this was WONDERFUL!  Great flavor, healthy.  My husband thought it was a "3", so I'm only giving it 4 stars, otherwise it would be a 5 for me.  He thought it was a little too bland-  I'll adjust the seasonings next time, def make again!!

These were Ok, perhaps a little bland. Somewhat time consuming in that I had to bake them for about 40 minutes to get the softness I like in the pepper. These were way better the next day when all the flavors had blended.

I love this recipe!  It makes way more stuffing that can fit in the peppers, but the stuffing is good by itself reheated the next day.  Also works well stuffed in zucchini "boats" if you don't care for peppers.

Really, really good! I used spicy turkey sausage, and thought it added an extra kick. I also boiled the green peppers first. All the chopping took a while, but was worth it. My father wished there was rice in it.

This is a wonderful recipe! My husband and I really enjoyed it. I steamed the bell peppers for 2 minutes and seasoned everything along the way -- the ground turkey, then the vegetables. I also added some cooked brown rice to the rest of the stuffing. Before baking, I topped each stuffed pepper with just a little bit of mixed cheese.

These were really yummy!  My hubby even liked them and he is not a turkey guy. I used yellow, green and red peppers.  Have made this 3 times since I found it.  Thanks so much!

Tasted like my usual pasta sauce, but inside a pepper instead of with diced peppers in the mix. I had to make some pasta and a plain tomato sauce to eat with this. I would have saved so much time if I just made my usual pasta. Sorry!

Tasted great, though I used only red and yellow. I needed to cook them longer then 15 minutes after stuffing to make the pepper soft enough to eat it, the way I like.

Tastes amazing but took me an hour and a half which seems like a lot on a work night.  Everyone enjoyed this tasty recipe though and it freezes well.

I'm surprised so many folks gave this recipe such a great review.  Then after reviewing them, I see all the substitutions and changes and I see why.  The recipe as it stands is very bland.  I ate one of the 4 peppers and threw the rest out.  It might be better using turkey sausage and cheese but I probably won't bother trying again.

LOVED the filling, but the peppers didn't get cooked enough in the time allowed.  I cooked them for 30 minutes after stuffing and ran out of time, and they still weren't done.  But the filling has a great taste.

The peppers came out good, if a bit dry.  I might mix the meat with a little lean ground beef or low fat soup mix just to give it a little more moisture. Otherwise the flavor was great.  And I made extra filling and used it in a sundried tomato wrap.....yummy.  I liked that better than the pepper.
