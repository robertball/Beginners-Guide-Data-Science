Followed recipe ingrediants exactley except I baked in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes or so. Delicious!!!! Wow! Hubby thought these would also be good with a slice of deli ham and swiss rolled in! Will make again for sure! Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was very good but I changed somethings around due to lack of ingrediants. I used honey dijon mustard and added half a slice of pepperjack cheese to each breast. On top of that I added 2 pieces of asparagus. I rolled the chicken up and wrapped 2 slices of bacon around the breasts.  Season with poultry seasoning and baked in oven at 375 for 30 min.  Then broiled on low for 5 min to cook bacon more.  I did not use the hollandaise sauce because of a picky husband.  Very good though

I'm a 66 year old retired guy cooking for his still working beautiful nurse wife.  I skipped over this recipe when I saw the microwave cooking but as I read the reviews I tried it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  WOW. I look like a hero chef to my wife.  Steamed cauliflower as the side dish and we raved about the chicken and the sauce.  The Dijon gives a little bite to the asparagus and we both loved this recipe. I did add just a hint of cayenne pepper on the breasts.  Loved this.

This came out really good. First I seasoned both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper then squirted a dollop of the mustard on each piece (didn't measure) and spread it out. I did not have any green onion. Rolled up with asparagus as instructed and used toothpicks to hold. I like many others did not feel comfortable making this in the microwave, so I sauteed the roll ups on all sides to get a nice brown color then sprinkled bread crumbs on top (didn't have crackers) and finished them off in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30min. While the chicken was baking I made the hollandaise sauce on the stove in a make-shift double boiler (glass bowl on top of pot of simmering water). The sauce came out great and really makes the dish. Served with linguine. Very impressive presentation.

I am a first time cook, and I hope this was not just beginners luck! The taste was really good, and it looked like it took me the whole morning to make. Definitely doing this again

This is CRAZY good! I did not use the microwave though, freaked me out. And being that it was a micro recipe I was not sure, even after baking it if it would be good. My husband took one bite and looked at me. I got nervous, but he said and I quote," This is amazing Rachel."! I ran over to get a bit too and it was just too too good. The sauce is worth making your own, it's killer!

I really enjoyed this recipe as did my husband. I was also really worried about cooking the chicken in the microwave so I baked it in the oven. This recipe was also good with pork chops and i used bread crumbs rather than crackers.

Restaurant quality.  I followed this recipe as is and it was very good.  I typically don't like to cook my food in the microwave, but I said I'd give it a try, especially since I needed something quick for dinner, and was well pleased. Thanks for sharing!!

This was excellent!  To save time, I used Knorr Hollandaise sauce mix, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Was even good the next day. Thank you!

I thought this was a very good recipe. Everyone enjoyed it, and it looks impressive! I cooked mine in the oven, but needed about 45 minutes at 375 degrees. I did not make the Hollandaise sauce or use mustand, but added some italian blended cheese in the middle with some garlic along with sprinkled cheese topping it for the last 5-10 minutes of baking. I also stuffed some tomato slices with the cheese and garlic which I cooked to accompany the chicken and it turned out delicious after baking those the last 10-15 minutes the chicken was int he oven.

This is a delicious dish. I made it the way the recipe called for except, I deviated by cooking it in the oven at 350 for 40 mins. I also added some thin slices of ham in the middle. The whole family loved it. It will become a regular in our house.

Really good! I also baked it at 350 for about 40 minutes and because I'm always undercook roll-ups i microwaved it for a couple minutes. I also added some herbed goat cheese inside. The hollandaise was surprisingly successful!

I really looked forward to preparing this recipe. I read several reviews and since I grow my own asparagus I thought it would work perfectly for a dinner with new friends. It came out good -- just not "great" as other reviewers touted. For me the sauce was just ..... OK. I think I will find another sauce that adds a little more depth and flavor to this really nice presentation. Visually it's a 5-Star meal.

great and fast.  this is one for the books, it looks and tastes like it took for ever, but just a few minutes and your off.   I too baked it, it just seems to easy to dry out in the microwave.  very happy. one last thing, i used yellow mustard w/some orange blossom  honey, not a bad substitute for dijon" i didnt have any".

added a slice of prosciutto on inside of chicken breast, then asparagus, then wrapped into a bundle.  Put buttered bread crumbs on top and baked at 350 for 30-35 minutes

I served this at a dinner party and the only thing I didn't like about it was the dijon mustard and the asparagus didn't go well together in terms of taste but I did get quite a few compliments!  Worth a try!

Excellent.  But had to microwave chicken about twice as long to cook fully. Next will try baking in oven instead of microwave.

OMG - this was amazing! I doubled the recipe for us and a teenage boy. The boy was full on one! I had really fat asparagus, so only used three stalks in the wrap. Added a slice of swiss cheese, browned the rolled up chicken before I put it in the oven for 40 minutes at 350. This is a keeper!!!! Great sauce too! Made it in a bowl inside a saucepan - sorry, microwaves scare me.

wow wow wow. This dish is amazing!!!!! I too chose to cook it in the oven. My husband gave it a 12 out of 10 so you know it is good. I don't believe it needs as much hollandaise sauce as it calls for though just because all that butter isn't good for you. But it is something that I am going to make again for sure. I will have to serve it at a dinner party. People would be impressed. Very very easy to make.

Super-easy prep and cooking. The only suggestion I have is to reduce the amount of butter in the Hollandaise Sauce, to cut back on calories and fat. I have passed this recipe on to my daughter, who just started living on her own.

Five stars!

This is a great recipe. It was fairly simple to make and tasted great.  I followed the instructions as written. Only thing that I did different was I seasoned the chicken with a little pepper before putting on the crushed crakers

My husband and I thought this one was just OK. Could be that the asparagus I chose wasn't the best. The dish presented well but the taste wasn't what I'd hoped.

This was great, though I too was uncomfortable with microwaving it. I broiled it instead.
