So I like to 'hook up' recipes with my own twist. I used half a cup of brewed coffee, 2 table spoons of Hagen Daz light Coffee Ice Cream, 3 ice cubes and 1/4 cup of skim milk. I thought it was mighty fine.
YUMMY 
If I can remember how I made it I will do it again :c)

This is good, but if you freeze left over coffee & use instead of ice cubes. I tablespoon of sugar-free chocolate syrup,1/2 cup milk.Lot less fat.

One TBSP of cinnamon is way to much for this recipe especially since it only makes one serving.  I only put in Â¼ tsp and found that was a bit much still.  If you like your coffee-mocha smoothies sweet then the ice-cream alone will not do it.  I needed to add a sweetener to mine.  Also, use strong coffee, if not the other ingredients dilute the taste.  I think this recipe needs to be tweaked too much to make it drinkable as written.

A good base recipe. I took this recipe and made it more adult.  I used the suggestion to use coffee ice cream instead of the chocolate.  Then I added to taste , about a shot of Irish Creme.  To top off I used whip creme or cool whip drissled with chocolate syrup.  Some one also suggested that I try Kahlua instead of the Irish Creme

Too much cinnamon.  It might be a typo because 1 tablespoon is a lot of cinnamon for a single serving.  Also not as strong a coffee flavor as I would have thought.  Maybe use espresso.  Won't make this again.

I used cold coffee, omitted the ice, used frozen vanilla yogurt and threw in one of those concentrated shots. To be honest, it was a long night last night and I was dealing with an hour's worth of sleep, so I gulped it down hoping the caffiene would work quickly. 

What I did taste, I liked. I guess. I'm 
awfully tired this morning.

I thought this was really good! I put espresso instead of coffee, and a little more icecream. :)

This would not have been good if I had made as written--1 T of cinnamon would have really been overpowering. It was okay with the changes I made. I used coffee ice cubes instead of regular, but the coffee flavor was still a bit weak. I would cut back on the milk next time. I only used 1/2 t of cinnamon, and that was still a bit too much. I like the slushy chocolate and cinnamon combo, but this recipe needs some tweaking. Thanks for the chocolate/cinnamon idea though.

This was good but the amount of cinnamon is way too overpowering!
