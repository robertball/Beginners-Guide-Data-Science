This is really simple and tasty.  I've made it twice now and the second time around I used 4 tomatillos and when I blended the tomatillos and jalapenos I added a little chicken broth.

Very good!  I also used additional tomatillos and only used 1 jalapeno since I have a tendency to make things too hot for most tastes.  I added about 1/4 C chicken broth and 1/4 t ground cumin.  Serverd on tortillas with mex blend cheese and something new, Rosa Rita green salsa verde, which had just the right kick.  Will make this again!

Good & easy recipe. As So. California residents my mother grows cactus aka Nopales in her yard & she harvests this "green meat" throughout the year. As kids we grew up on it. Thanks for sharing with my additions it was a hearty meal that got rave reviews.  I served it corn tortillas, a side of rice and limes. 

My edits:  I added tablespoon of chicken bouillon, garlic and a big chunky onion.

Not enough flavor for me.  Definitely needed salt.  I used fresh nopales (grown on our property) and they made the mixture pretty slimy.  My Mexican husband told me when it was too late that I should have chopped them before boiling and the boiling would take the sliminess out.  Maybe next time.

I understand that this is "con Nopales" but after having it, I can't say that the cactus was really worth the mess and effort. I think a better substitute for the flavors in this would just be green peppers/pepper medley. Otherwise, a fantastic recipe. I added some garlic powder, a bunch of fresh cilantro, and a 1/4 onion to the green sauce and the flavor was phenomenal. Will definitely make it again with the above adjustments.

Not bad. I used pre-cooked, packaged chicken slices, and added a dash of garlic powder, 2 tbsp lime juice, and 2 tbsp of dried cilantro leaves. I didn't shred my chicken, just a personal preference. Thanks, Chef Kiki.

This is absolutely amazing!! Unlike the white people on here who want to  on this recipe and change it, "ooh I didn't use cactus ewww gross blah blah I used bell peppers blah blah" it's called CON NOPALES for a reason!!! Once you take away the nopales and substitute bell peppers, all it is now is like santa fe chicken, BORING.. Follow this recipe and you'll be pleased!! Trust me, growing up Hispanic, nopales was a staple in our house, so good!!

Very good flavor!  We used bell peppers instead of nopales and added one white onion and a bit of chicken broth, served over white rice and/or in corn tortillas.  Everyone loved it!  Definitely a keeper!!

This dish is absolutely amazing! The only thing I did differently was added a few more spices, then it was perfect!

Great and simple recipe. It is a bit bland so be prepared to add some seasoning... which is no big deal. Great way to use nopales in the back yard.

I made this using all the ingredients (plus chicken broth per one of the reviewers alterations), but did not follow the quantities. Mainly because I didn't know how it would turn out. While it came out delicious, it tasted a bit tangy.  My brother and mom liked it and one of my nieces as well. Next time I make it I'll probably use less nopales.  It looked more like nopales con pollo instead of the other way around. I used 2 jalapeños and 4 tomatillos, one ladle of chicken broth, 1/2 a bag of raw nopales and 3 chicken thighs instead of chicken breast (it's what I had on hand).
