Very yummy.  I mixed in some green chilies and a little cheese.  I folded them like mini burritos to keep the cheese in.  I served with Mexican rice and sour cream. This recipe really makes a lot.  I still had leftovers after using the entire package of tortillas so I will make some quesadillas with the leftovers.  Thanks for the quick easy recipe!

Yummy!  My whole family (husband and kids, ages 5 & 3) loved these.  They didn't take too long and were VERY easy.  My husband said the only thing they were missing was some sour cream (we ate them with no toppings).

I gave this five stars because it was surprisingly good for such a simple recipe.  We added sour cream and salsa as toppings.  Will make again for sure.

I sprinkled the mixture with a little garlic salt, added some cheese, then folded them like Chimichangas and grilled them.

My husband and daughter profess to hate olives but they each had seconds without a clue. Later when I told them they ate enjoyed olives they were shocked. I did add green peppers too. I baked them and they were great.

This is very good. Another poster mentioned a quick shot of cooking spray then bake. Nice & crispy that way.

Good basic recipe.  My mix consists of: shredded cooked meat, salsa, cheese, taco or fajita seasoning, onion, green bell pepper. (add ins: spinach, carrots, corn, olives..) Blend all ingredients in food processor, spread spoonful in tortilla, roll, bake. I I serve with ranch, salsa, or sour cream
