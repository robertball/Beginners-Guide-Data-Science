Yummmy!!!!!! I can't believe how good this recipe tasted! I made it as a part of a big spread for a party. People could not leave it  alone, including myself. I have already transferred this one into my permanent book. Thanks Kimber!

I don't know what to make of this. For some reason, the Italian dressing throws everything off. It completely hides the flavors of the peppers and onions. The amount of beans is excessive, I think, 2 cans would be more than enough. If I were to make this again, I'd double the amount of jalapeno, or perhaps use a serrano pepper instead, and add a teaspoon of cumin. I won't be making this again, but it was nice to try something different.

Maybe I need to be from the south to get it, but I wasn't thrilled with this.  I tried it by itself as a side dish, and with tortilla chips as a dip (as another reader used it).  It seemed all I could taste was this bland bean taste, as though I were just eating a can of beans by itself.  Doesn't make sense considering all the flavorful ingredients, but there it is.

This is a great recipe.. and to argue a point with a previous reviewer I think it needed MORE peas which I added.  I took it to a party and it was gone super fast.  Thanks
