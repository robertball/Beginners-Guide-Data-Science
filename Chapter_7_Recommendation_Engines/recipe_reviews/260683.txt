I liked it very much. I’m not into “spicy”, so I left out cayenne, but it still had a kick to it. Also- didn’t have shallots, so added extra onions. Served it with rice. Just a LOT of spices!!!!!!

Very good flavors, but be warned it's on the spicy side. I used only 3 chicken thighs, but would do more next time. I added about 2 cups of water to cover my chicken and it made for a very rich sauce. Served with rice and some sour cream.
