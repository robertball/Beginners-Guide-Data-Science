This is absolutely delicious, a roasted carrots along with the cabbage wedges- I made slow-cooker corned beef, but only included the onions and potatoes with the meat.  Roasting the cabbage and carrots in the oven to serve on the side is much tastier!

This was my first time ever trying roasted cabbage. I have to say it was better than I was expecting. I added a little parm and a squeeze of lemon. I cut mine thinner so I cooked it a shorter amount of time.

I especially like the simplicity of this dish. I used cabbage I didn't want to throw out and followed recipe as stated. I served it with oven baked chicken, candied carrots and English baked potatoes, all compliments of this site. Nice change and tasty

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I sprinkled just a touch of garlic powder on mine along with the salt, pepper and olive oil and I had to cook mine for 1 hour to get the desired tenderness.  Very simple and the same great flavor as steamed cabbage! An added bonus was that I didn’t have to stand over the stove tending to it.  I will definitely cook this again .

Delicious!  I’m on dialysis and substituted Mrs Dash seasoning for the salt.  Especially like the charred, crispy bits.

Excellent recipe...very simple.  Was concerned the cabbage would be too hard to cut.  That was not an issue.  Followed instructions AND kept the core in to keep the wedges together.  Tented the quarters the 1st 15 minutes, flipped them and left them uncovered for the 2nd 15 minutes.  Delicious!!

Really loved the roasted flavor of this cabbage dish. I’d covered it the first 30 minutes with aluminum foil. Then removed foil for remaining time.

loved it!! Even the kids liked it enough to not just eat it but remarked on how good it was. I have a cabbage hater that ate it also. I did cover the cabbage about half way through to keep it moist and cooked until tender. about 40 minutes. All ovens seem to cook different. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I made it as directed, but also sprinkled caraway seeds on both sides before roasting it.

this turned out pretty good for being my first time roasting cabbage.. i think i sliced my cabbage smaller than one inch pieces because a little after 30 minutes they were completely charred on the outter layers.. the rest was really good though.. everyone's oven is different so i'll just pay more attention next time.. i drizzled the leftover marinade from Cilantro Lime Grilled Tofu (on this site) over the cabbage.. it was to die for.. ty for the recipe

Very good!  I love finding new recipes for using veggies from the garden.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  The family loved it.  It's a keeper!

Pretty basic, but that's the beauty of it. Great with roast potato's and Ham. Great way to use up one of my farm share cabbages...

Loved this! I used both purple and green cabbage, and added in some crushed garlic and the juice of a lemon. Perfect side dish that my daughter and I loved.

Simple and delicious! I used olive oil cooking spray in place of the olive oil b/c it's easier to coat the cabbage and I use less oil, which helps me keep it even healthier. LOVED the sweet, charred flavor. A keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
