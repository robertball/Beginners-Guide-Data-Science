Fantastic recipe!!!! I was searching for a great mini sandwich idea to make for my parents 50th anniversary party. I have to tell you, big big hit. The relish really makes this, I used about 4 Tablespoons of rosemary and red onion. Instead of using mini bread, I used whole loaf pumpernickel and cut them in 1/4. Every time I looked at my dad, he was eating another sandwich. I can't say enough about this recipe. Thank you so much!!!!!!! oh by the way, I wish I would of taken a picture so I could summit it.

I found this recipe because I was looking to replicate a cranberry onion jam I had in a restaurant. I don't eat ham but the relish was perfect for turkey sandwiches.

Nothing special.  I was invited to an indoor "picnic" party and did a trial run and see no reason to make again. I don't think it is even worth trying again, with adjustments.
