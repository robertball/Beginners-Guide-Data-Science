The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was far too sour. The second time I halved the amount of berries and it worked perfectly (you can really taste the soy so if you don't like that flavour this isn't a recipe for you!).

This was okay. It was very thick and I thought the flavors were a little weird together. Probably won't make it again.

This is really good but I agree that it's a little sour as written. To adjust it I simply used the other banana half with another scoop of chocolate and a splash more chocolate soy milk as needed. Next time I'm going to try it with strawberries instead of raspberries. I think that will make it 5 stars!

This was good but if you don't add the banana and use blackberry ciao Bella sorbet instead of chocolate this will be FABULOUS!!!! Both the original and my changes make great ice creams if you freeze them btw. Great job chef17411!!!!!

Fairly often I add an egg to a smoothie. Shell and all. Good way of being sure of my calcium.

A perfect dessert smoothie. I'm going to try using carob sorbet and see how that goes. Thank you so much CHEF17411
