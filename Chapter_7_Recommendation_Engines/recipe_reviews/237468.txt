Such a great salad.  By itself or with meat, gonna try topping leftovers with a poached egg for breakfast.

Fabulous salad! I had roasted some beets last night, and was looking for a salad to use them in and stumbled upon this recipe, and so glad that I did. We used mixed greens in place of the spinach, as that's what I had on hand. I just put all of the toppings on the salad and then drizzled with the dressing. It was delicious! I can't wait to have it tomorrow again for lunch!

Wonderful salad!  The husband doesn't like hot beets so I was looked for a recipe using cold beets and found this.  I peeled and diced the beets before cooking and didn't add avocado.

Based on the recipe, I thought it might be just ok.  Was I wrong!  Absolutely delicious, more flavour then I could have imagined.  I did use a little more lemon juice, as I love lemon, and this gave the dressing such an added pop.  If you like beets, you will love this recipe!

I'll admit I used canned beets (rinsed and cut into large chunks), but this was still really delicious. When I have more time, I'll do it the way the recipe recommends.

I made the recipe exactly as written, it was delicious, the flavors from the dressing beets and other veggies was awesome. We had this with steak on the grill will definitely keep this recipe and use it often

Excellent!  My husband doesn't like beets so I don't get much of an opportunity to eat them.  I thought I'd try this recipe - he loved it!

I LOVE Allrecipes.com, but have never reviewed a recipe until now. This beer salad was seriously so delicious! Even my picky hubby who hates anything new raved about it. So good!!!

Very easy recipe that tastes wonderful on a summer's night.  My husband, who absolutely refuses to eat beets, actually had a second helping along with my kids.  That marks "SUCCESS" in my book!  Thank you for the recipe!

This is delicious!  I've made other recipes very similar to this one - but this is the best.  As others have said, the mustard and lemon in the dressing is a great accent.

Very good and interesting salad recipe.  I thought the dressing, as is, was a bit too tart.  I added a bit of sugar to sweeten it up.

I made this just like the recipe said and it was delicious.
It did not however look like the picture.   I mixed it all together and the beets made it purple.   I have left overs and can't wait to eat the rest.
