I prepared two of these casseroles and used flavored croutons.  I prepared one and immediately baked it and the other I let sit over night.  The one that sat over night was superior by far!   It had a ton more flavor.  I also chose to add a little more milk and a few extra eggs to the one I let sit overnight.  Also added extra cheese.  You can never have enought cheese.

Ok, here goes.  I love, love, love this, however, my family is trying to eat healthier so I made some changes.  First I omitted the butter entirely and used 1 egg plus 1 1/2 cups Egg Beaters.  I used half regular cheese and half fat free cheese, fat free croutons and 1/2 C lower sodium, real bacon bits.  I prepared it the night before and cooked for about an hour in a 9x13 pan and did not adjust the milk at all.  It turned out wonderful (not soggy) and this altered version is so much healthier.  I got 8 servings and froze some so I coukd just pull them out of the freezer and reheat in the microwave for a midweek breakfast.  They reheated wonderfully in the microwave. Thank you so much!

I am testing out brunch recipes for the party I am having New Year's Eve and husband and I both agreed that this was very good.  I chose this one over the other bacon/sausage casseroles because of the ingredients that I felt would give it more flavor......i.e. the flavored croutons and mustard.  What a great touch!  I used caesar salad croutons since thats what I had.  I halved the recipe, however, since it was just hubby and I and made it in an 8x8 pan.  Perfect for half the ingredients, which leads me to agree with another reviewer.....if making the full recipe in a 9x13, you should do 1.5 times the recipe, otherwise it will be a bit flat.  At first I thought the bacon was too much, even at 6 slices for halved recipe, but it was perfect!  I used red pepper since hubby doesn't like green.......has a very nice presentation and slices up well.  Oh I still had to cook the full 40 min. even though I halved the recipe.  Very tasty!  Thanks for sharing.  Unless I find a better one, this will make an appearance at the party.

This breakfast casserole was fantastic, but I did make just a few changes, based on other reviewers.  I replaced the "soggy" croutons with potatoes (I used half a bag of frozen cubed hash browns - nuked for about 1 minute), and since I'm not a big fan of bacon, I used fresh Italian breakfast sausage (out of the casings), which I cooked in a skillet, drained, and crumbled.  I used 8 eggs and 2 cups of milk, I only used about 1/3 of a green pepper, and I added a teaspoon of onion powder and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  This casserole was SO delicious!  I will make it again and again!!

Very good- you never know with custard (eggbased) recipes like this how they will turn out- I always worry about them being too gloopy but this was perfect.  I did up the eggs and milk a bit and used garlic/cheese croutons as one other reviewer suggested- GREAT IDEA- FYI, I bought way too many croutons because I didn't know if one bag had 3 cups in it- now I know- a 16 oz bag of croutons is just the right amount.  I also added chives.  Will definitely make again!

This is very delicious and impressive to serve to guest. I made the smaller 8X8 version. I used 4 eggs and, condensed milk, a dash of cinnamon (sounds weird but it adds something), garlic cheese croutons, and cheese crumbles by Kraft. As another reviewer mentioned, 8X8 still needs 40min cooking time.  I served w/ salsa (optional), Toast Corners (from this site) and CranApple Juice w/ fresh raspberries. This is something anyone can do and your guest(s) will rave!

First, thanks to Scott for posting this fantastic recipe!  I was looking for something a bit different that the traditional breakfast casseroles, (which to me are pretty much all the same) for a breakfast at work. I made this recipe EXACTLY as written, (except I used 8 eggs) using Marie Calenders cheese and garlic croutons, 1/2 red and 1/2 green chopped peppers for Christmas, and a really good cut of bacon, and Mexican blend cheese, and put it in the fridge overnight.  Baked in the morning before work.  Easy to layer, croutons on the bottom, then melted butter, cheese, egg/pepper mixture and top with bacon.  The croutons you choose will be crucial to the outcome, so pick something with tons of flavor.  Might seem wierd, but it is crucial. One little trick that may help...cook your bacon until done but not crispy, still soft.  I tore the bacon instead of crumbled, in large chunks, and on top of the dish it looked like big pieces of meat.  (During the cooking, the bacon doesn't become overcooked this way).  When it came out of the oven, it was so beautiful I wanted to take a picture of it!  And, of all the dishes at the breakfast, mine was the one EVERYONE was talking about!  Many requests for the recipe, they wanted to know what was the "secret ingredient" that tasted so GREAT (croutons) and several that said they will not make a traditional breakfast casserole again!  Hehehehe!  This recipe made me a superstar at work! LOVE IT!  :)  And...cheesy easy as well.  You can't go wr

This was an excellent casserole.  I used 8 eggs to make it a little thicker and added mushrooms, roma tomatoes, and onion to give it that much more flavor.  Surprisingly it reheats very well.

This is a great recipe!  It has a wonderful taste.  I did make alot more bacon than it called for just for more (meat) and I like lots of different cheese together so I mix swiss and parmasean as well as the cheddar.  On the croutons get the ones that say "seasoned".  Oh, before I forget, it shows prep and cook time, cook time shows 50 min and in the directions below it show bake 40 min., bake 50min or until egg in center done.  40 min not long enough.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent, made it up the night before, didn't add salt as the bacon and croutons are salty, did half red and half green peppers as it was Christmas Day and everybody loved it!

5 stars for a foolproof recipe.  I definitely recommend the seasons croutons and refrigerating overnight before baking the next a.m. I used 12 eggs but didn't double anything else. I was still concerned about so much milk, but the croutons soaked it up and it was perfect, as was the mustard seasoning.  UPDATE DEC 2010:  Made this dish w/Italian Sausage (chicken-type) AND used stuffing mix b/c I was out of croutons.  The sage in the stuffing mix only enhanced the chicken Italian sausage.  Family definitely preferred the Italian sausage version to any other.  This is now a family favorite, and I LOVE mixing and refrigerating the night before.  What a time saver and crowd pleaser!

Followed recipe exactly, put together on Christmas Eve then refrigerated. On Christmas morning I put in the oven while the kids were opening their presents. Was delicious.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! It has already become a family tradition for Christmas morning, it is so delicious!  The changes I made to the recipe were:  - I used a larger amount of eggs and milk, 12 eggs and 2.5 cups of milk  - I added more vegetables, including broccoli, tomato, mushrooms and caramelized onions  Also, allowing this dish to sit in the fridge overnight is a must before tossing in the oven, the flavours blend together ten times better!

This was fantastic! We added a little moonshine to it, which gave it a nice flavor...ha ha just kidding. We went directly by the recipe, except omitting the bell peppers, and it tasted wonderful!

After having an overnight slow cooker egg dish bomb for our Christmas morning breakfast I needed to redeem myself with New Years Day. This recipe is a winner. The changes I made were slight...used a 9x13 pan, 9 eggs, 2 cups of milk, 1 lb. of bacon and 1 5.5 oz pkg. garlic cheese croutons, and no butter (you can also use 1 tsp. dried mustard in place of prepared if need be). I did opt to prepare it the night before and bake it the next morning at 350 degrees for 50 minutes since that is what all my other egg dishes are baked at. The eggs turned out perfect...great flavor, not too much bread. I don't crumble the bacon...we like it in big bite sized pieces. I think that adds to the presentation. Enjoy!

This recipe was really quick and easy to make...not to forget to say, really good too.  I made it with cooked, crumbled breakfast sausage and a red bell pepper instead of a green one.  I might use swiss or another cheese with less oil content next time, but the cheddar tasted really good too.  Oh, and I put the sausage directly over the cheese and poured the egg and milk mixture of the entire thing.  I will definately make this again.

I've made this several times now using bacon, ham, and most recently sausage.  It comes out great everytime.  I add onions too.  One 6 oz. box of any flavor croutons is just right for a 13X9 pan.  I've tried seasoned and ceasar croutons and it is great either way.  Don't be afraid to experiment with this recipe.  It would be hard to mess it up.

I made this recipe for Christmas brunch and it was delicious! I assembled it the night before and popped it in the oven 30 min before my guests arrived. It was cooked perfectly in the suggested time. I could not in good conscience use 1/4 cup of melted butter, so I drizzled the croutons with olive oil. I also used 2% cheddar cheese (1 1/2 cups), cheese and garlic croutons, red pepper and chopped onions. I just realized that I forgot to add mustard, but it was still great. I would definitely make this again!

Tasty casserole! Per reviews, I used 8 eggs, 2 cups of milk, and an entire pack of bacon (about 15 strips). The croutons I used were Sea Salt & Pepper, which gave the casserole a great flavor. I prepared the night before and baked it the next morning for 55 minutes.

Fabulous! It is better made ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to bake. It does not need more milk or eggs, great just the way it is.

This was awesome!  I used unseasoned dry bread cubes left over from Thanksgiving and tossed them with some italian seasoning.  It was also a little "flat" for a 9x13 pan, so I might make 1.5 times the recipe next time.
Tastewise it was a winner at our annual Holiday Brunch.

This was delicious!  The flavor was terrific.  I used chopped ham instead of bacon because I was already serving bacon as a side.  I just used about a half pound of deluxe deli ham, chopped up.  I increased the eggs to about 10 and increased the milk by about 1/4 cup.  Assembled the night before, and it was still runny in the center after the baking time, so I stuck it back in for about 15 minutes to finish.  There was some grease on top when I took it out, so I absorbed the excess with a paper towel, then sprinkled a little shredded cheddar on top.  I have tried many egg casseroles for Christmas brunch, and this is my new favorite!

YUMMY!  We eat breakfast for dinner at least once a week and this recipe will be making frequent appearances at my table.  Everyone loved it.  Left out the peppers, only because I didn't have any, and it was still awesome.  I also misread the recipe and thought it called for dry mustard.  I thought 1 tablespoon was an awful lot so I only put in 1/2tsp.  It was perfect!  Thanks for the post, Scott!  Update: I make this for guests with fresh spinach and smoked gouda cheese. They made me queen for the day!

This is one of the best breakfast casseroles I have tasted. I used the garlic and cheese croutons and added 2 extra eggs and extra milk as others have suggested. This was a huge success at work!!

Was very flavorful but next time I would add 1 or 2 more eggs, not enough filling for me.......and do NOT overbake it,  knock 5 min or so off the cooking time if you make recipe according to recipe, it is a little too dry otherwise. But all in all lots of flavor and I used cheese and garlic croutons.

Very Good. I made this for Easter brunch and everyone loved it. To spice it up a bit, I added onion and garlic to the original recipe. Very easy to make and fun to eat.

We love this dish, and have it quite frequently as part of our Sunday breakfast.  I do make a few changes to better suit our family.  I do not use the bell pepper, as several people do not care for them. I also don't put the butter over the croutons. This can also be done as an overnight casserole, as I sometimes do it.  Fully assembled, I cover the dish and put it in the fridge overnight. In the morning, I put the dish on the counter while the oven preheats, then bake as instructed.  This is a great timesaver in the morning.  I have also done this dish with sausage instead of bacon, and it is equally delicious.

Wonderful tasting, easy and quick to make.  Sent to my granddaughter's school for a breakfast honoring grandparents, at the end none of it was left and several other casseroles were hardly touched.  Now I make it for home and cut it in squares and freeze it for a quick in-a-hurry breakfast.

Every time I make this people go nuts.  It's so easy and good.  I usually do one with either sausage or bacon, and the other one I make vegetarian.  I think you could pretty much put in anything you want, it's almost impossible to screw it up.

This Casserole is wonderful!! It was a huge success at our office brunch and there was not a crumb leftover. Modified the recipe by dicing and adding fresh onions (1/2 cup), parsley (1/4 Cup), and mushrooms (1/2 cup).  Also added about 1/3 cup extra milk and 2 more eggs to the mix… probably added more cheese than is called for too. :) I refridgerated it overnight based on other recommendations.   For simplicities sake, I used the precooked/packaged bacon, sliced it and sprinkled it over the top (no ones is the wiser and there is no mess!). This won't be the last time I make this dish!

I made this last month and although it did taste good my husband and I found that it wasn't very filling.  By the time you did get full our calorie count was out the wah-zoo.  The only difference I made was used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon.  My 6 yr old raved about how tasty it was to her, but she's not counting calories...lol.

I picked this dish in honor of my parents who live in SC and were in town for my son's birthday. Excellent! I made this for a brunch and my guests raved. The dish was scraped clean! This was very easy to throw together the night before my brunch. I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it was so good. I did use a "casserole" cheese mix (cheddar, American, Colby, Monterrey-Jack, Mozzerella) which I really think helped enhance the taste. I also used herb croutons.  I'm going to make this  for a change-of-pace dinner soon. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this several times, including this past Christmas morning and I always get rave reviews from my family and friends!  I made it on Christmas Eve, kept it in the fridge overnight, and it was wonderful-I used the extra eggs as mentioned in other reviews.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent.  I skipped the butter, used 12 eggs, a little over 2 cups of milk, 1 red pepper, 1/4 cup chopped onion and extra croutons and cheese to fill a 13x9" glass pan.  Got compliments from all at Easter Brunch and reheated leftovers were very good too.  I did make the day before and just popped in the oven in the morning.  Baked for 45 minutes.

I used sausage instead of bacon, a red bell pepper and onion (that I sautéed in butter).  I also added a can of diced green chilies.  I also used seasoned croutons.  Yummy!  My 4 yr old ate it but my picky 7 yr old wouldnt touch it.  My husband and I loved it.

We had this exact same casserole for breakfast on Christmas morning, except I made it using crumbled, browned and drained breakfast sausage and added to the eggs about 6 ounces of frozen chopped spinach that had been thawed and squeezed dry. It was a winner.  The packaged croutons are much easier than making your own bread cubes and have a lot of flavor.

I cooked this for a large group of Wyoming ranch hands and got RAVE reviews, was even asked if I catered...
I served with cinnamon rolls, from this site, for a wonderful brunch after working cows on a cool fall morning, it was sure a hit.  Will make this a tradition on Christmas morning, as made the night before and the flavors were out of this world, so the kids can ejoy their Santa gifts while breakfast cooks and I won't have to get up at 4:30 a.m. to prepare.  THANKS!!!

Presentation and flavor are WONDERFUL!  Other reviewers suggested trying green chilies or adding onion, but this was PLENTY of rich flavor first thing in the morning.  Texture didn't fare quite as well...since I assembled it the night before, I followed the advice of adding 2 eggs and 1/4 milk.  However it was sort of runny in the middle and very hard to cook evenly - so next time I'll stick with the original amounts in the recipe.  I might also use a little larger casserole dish (I used 8X8), since this would also help it cook more thoroughly.  I notice other reviewers said just the opposite, so maybe it has more to do with your oven.  Mine is sort of ornery and usually does require more cooking time than most recipes call for...but if you have a convection oven or one that cooks right on the money, then maybe the extra eggs and milk is the thing to do.  Regardless, this is a keeper, and once we get the texture thing down, I will proudly serve this to guests and at family gatherings.  It is the best breakfast casserole we've tried...

Very good recipe that you can tailor to what you have on hand.  I like to use leftover bread that I cube up and Spray with I Can't Believe  it's not Butter spray and sprinkle some garlic salt or seasoning salt on top and toast my home made croutons up in the oven.  I like to use turkey sausage, egg beaters and add peppers and onions that I saute in extra virgin olive oil.  My egg and sausage eating husband never knows the healthier version difference.

This was wonderful.  At least five people asked for the recipe.  Made it the day before and baked on Christmas morning for a family brunch.  Did use Asiago cheese because I was out of cheddar.  Very Yummy.

Vegetarian version...substitute the bacon with cooked crumbled smokey bacon tempheh by Turtle Island...delish! Also do multiple colored peppers for visual interest. Very yummy, used this for Christmas brunch...no regrets!

Was looking for a quick breakfast recipe.  Found this and decided to give it a try.  Only changed a few things.  Cooked the whole package of bacon, added some mozzarella cheese and used fat free seasoned croutons.  Did not have any peppers on hand so was unable to put any in.  Loved it without the peppers.  We will be keeping this recipe to put together when famliy comes to visit.  Quick, easy and basic.

What a fabulous idea using croutons! I only had 1 1/2 cups of croutons - so i added 4 slices of toast, scissor-cut into squares. I also added a few extra eggs, cheese & milk to stretch it for my large family, and made it in the morning for a "breakfast for dinner" meal. GREAT!

What a fabulous, easy recipe.  I did a half batch (8x8) and prepared the night before. As mentioned, a small batch still takes the full 40 minutes.
 I used an extra egg and the seasoned Texas Toast croutons, which worked great.  My batch was a little bland, so I'll tweak the seasonings a little next time.  But overall, it was awesome.

I made this casserole for a work breakfast meeting, and everyone loved it!  The casserole dish was practically licked clean.  The only modifications I made were to use chopped green chilis instead of bell pepper as well as add one small diced onion.  Before adding the onions to the egg mixture, I sauted them in the bacon grease for about 5 minutes.  I'm not a huge fan of eggs and this was the perfect solution.  The croutons practically dissolve and make the egg mixture nice and fluffy. I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks!

I try a new breakfast casserole every couple weeks and this one was a big hit with my family!  I added a fried onion instead of the green pepper and used one extra egg like someone else had suggested.  I didn't have any croutons on hand so I made some using the recipe from this site and it made it very tasty!
Thanks for a great recipe, it's a keeper!

I loved this recipe.  I made it the night before and to let the croutons soak.  I planned on adding the bacon in the morning, but my husband was trying to be nice and got up early to put the casserole in the oven!  We put the bacon on top of the cooked casserole.  It was still very good.

My entire family came over for breakfast. I knew I had to make something special because everyone would be starving when they got up.  I added a few extra ingredients.  First we used hashbrowns and croutons.  We used garlic butter instead of regular butter. We used bacon, bacon bits and maple honey ham.  For the veggies we used green pepper, onion, and tomatoes.  Yummy!  We increased the amount of cheese to 5 cups because the family really loves cheese.  Go big or go home. Loved It Family Loved it Will Make it Again!!!!!

This was so good that I decided to make it for my entire family for Christmas. I added onions and chopped garlic in the egg mix. Using flavored croûtons I think helps as well. Thanks for the great recipe.

I would give this a three when eating it straight from the oven and a five when eating it the day after as heated leftovers.  Very tasty the 2nd day.  Maybe the flavors have had time to settle in because it's less "airy" and the ingredients really come alive.  This is a great way to get rid of croutons that have been sitting in the pantry.

This was fabulous!  I made it for a morning meeting at work and there was none left over.  I did what some of the other reviews recommended.  Add 2 more eggs if you put it in the fridge overnight.

Excellent!  I made this for breakfast on a cold Sunday morning and it was delicious.  I halved the recipe and it still turned out great.  Only modification I made was to use sliced turkey instead of bacon. Yummm

This was wonderful.  I made a couple of changes.  First, I only used have of the bacon.  I did add 2 more eggs and tomatoes and onions.  I used a variety of flavored croutons, and thought they added nice flavor.  I made this the night before for a family brunch the next day and everyone loved it!! This is definitely a keeper

This was excellent.  Following the advice of others, I used 8 eggs rather than 6.  I also let it soak overnight and baked it the following morning.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious.  I used Texas Toast garlic and cheese croutons and it really gave the casserole a ton of flavor.  It says add salt to taste.  I did add salt, but will skip it next time.  The bacon and croutons add plenty of flavor...no additional salt needed.

This was a great recipe to get the basics from for a breakfast casserole! It turned out delicious and I made some changes. My family prefers sausage over bacon so I ommitted the bacon and used two lbs. of maple sausage. I also added in one cup of green onions. Once I put the sausage in the dish, I whisked 3 more eggs and added them to the top of the sausage, pouring evenly. Then I topped with cheese, as directed. I made it the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator over night. It turned out amazing!!!!

This recipe is very similar to one that I've been making for years.  I bet it would be very good for breakfast or brunch but I wouldn't know.  I always make it 1st thing in the morning, refrigerate it & then bake it in time for dinner.  It makes an easy dinner after a busy day!  For side dishes try sliced tomatoes, fried taters, grits or even a tossed salad.  Yummy!

Love this recipe and always get lots of compliments when I serve it. Seasoned croutons give it much more flavor than most breakfast casseroles. I also add chopped bell pepper.

I made this a few years ago for a Christmas brunch and it was such a big hit! I am asked to make this every year for our Christmas breakfast. I did use flavored croutons and red and green peppers (which made it very festive). I made it the day before, brought it out to sit for about 30 minutes and then baked per the recipe. ENJOY!

I love this recipe and have made it often.  I sometimes do a cheese only version for picky eaters. It is best made the night before and refrigerated overnight.

Good--but "heart attack in a dish"!  I've made something similar but use Egg Beaters or similar product and it tastes just as good.  Turkey bacon or turkey sausage would reduce calories and sodium, too.

I made 2 servings. I used sharp cheese (Cougar Gold from WA.), I didn't add any pepper. I don't care for them. I used prepared honey mustard, about a teaspoon. I found this dish to be very good. I'd make it again for sure.

I made this for christmas breakfast and it was wonderful, I added some chunks of cream cheese ontop of the bread before I poured in the egg mixture, also put a dab of cheyene pepper to the mix.... I doubled it and it took along time in the oven, so I sped up the process and zapped it for 15 min and the Microwave and it didn't hurt a thing it was loved by all... I'm making it again this weekend for out of town company..

This was the best breakfast casserole I have made yet, and I have made a lot. 
It was simple to put together, and I like that it was one that did not have to be assembled the night before & placed in the refrigerater. 

The only changes I made were sauteing the bell pepper with 1/2 of a medium chopped onion, in olive oil. 

This recipe's definately a keeper.

I would say 3 0r  4 stars. I thought it was  very good. My husband immediately said, 
"this is a make again!" I found this recipe on New Years day, today and happened to have all the ingredients on hand. We had just frozen some bread crumb chunks from a bread that we forgot to eat. It was a Rosemary bread and that flavor added a great taste to the casserole. I also added onion and garlic and used Monterey Jack cheese instead of Cheddar cheese. It baked fine in the 9x13 inch pan.

This was okay.   Was not the best breakfast casserole I've tried, nor the worst.  I think it was the croutons that I didn't care for.   I used seasoned.  Maybe I should have used regular.  Anyway, thanks so much for the recipe!  I enjoyed trying it.

This was really good.  I used seasoned croutons, a can of green chilies,(omitted the green pepper) and 8 eggs.  I did have to cook it for at least 1 hour.  I put it together in the morning and we ate it for dinner.  It had plenty of time for the flavors to come together.

I made this for guests this past weekend and within minutes it was gone!  I used the cheese and garlic croutons and added frozen chopped broccoli.  The possibilities on this one are truly endless.  Soooo good! Oh...I set it up the night before for a quick and easy morning meal.  Add 2 extra eggs if you do.

Very simple to make.  I will make this again.  Save a step and melt the butter in the pan and toss to coat croutons.  Ready cooked bacon works great and saves time.

I always like to prepare the recipe as written the very first time. And this, as is, is a very tasty treat (morning, noon or night!) I took it to a church breakfast and it was gobbled up within minutes! I had the foresite to keep several pieces out for myself of course! Next time I will add another cup or so of croutons to thicken it up a bit, and also some onions, mushrooms, etc, as mentioned in other reviews.  Excellent recipe!

I made this for a breakfast potluck.  There were two tables of food.  My casserole was GONE and I had several people compliment me on it.  I used cheese-garlic croutons and a couple of extra eggs to stretch it out.  Since some people don't like the flavor of green pepper, I used red.  It was delish!

This is a great recipe. I did have to make some changes. I did not have croutons so used a box of chicken stove top stuffing in its place. Also, instead of bacon I used cooked and drained bulk Italian sausage. Finally, I only use horseradish mustard on hand so I used that.I will definitely make this the next time I have family visiting.

I made it as the recipe stated except I added some extra eggs & milk, was hesitant about the croutons but it turned out great. I only give it four stars because I think it still needs to jazzed up a bit with hot sauce or more stuff.

highly recommend! made it last night using 9 eggs, 1 3/4 cup half&half plus 3/4 cup lo-fat milk, 1 pkg of sliced swiss (diced) and 1/2 cup cottage cheese (mixed into egg mixture),large lo-fat seasoned croutons, and 1 pkg bacon. microplaned fresh nutmeg to cover egg mixture if that makes sense, (approximately 1/8 teaspoon).  no butter, salt or pepper.  layered as directed and refrigerated it overnight sans bacon. baked it this morning topping with bacon approximately 25 minutes into baking.  it was not greasy or soggy at all.  it was the only breakfast item at a bring-an-item brunch that was eaten in its entirety. i was pretty happy!

Very easy and tastes wonderful.  I did increase the milk to 2 cups and used 10 eggs as other reviewers suggested.  I also made it the night before and added veggies.  It was a little salty but we didn't mind and that was probably because of the croutons I used.

We really like this and it's easy to make. Not an over the top recipe with a million ingredients. I have only made this the day of, not overnight. . I use Texas Toast croutons because they are big and use a little less butter.  I have made this several times using different meats and vegetables (using what I have on hand).  Thanks for the recipe :)

The first time I made this, I didn't really think it was anything special, but everyone else really liked it.  So, I made it again.  This time I sprinkled a little salt over the croutons (even though they are seasoned, they become kind of bland when  soaked with the liquid and cooked), used a little more cheese, and added a few chopped onions and halved cherry tomatoes.  I used a little more bacon on top, but the bacon called for in the recipe is pretty adequate.  Anyway, my 13 year old granddaughter and two grown sons loved it, so guess I misjudged it in the beginning.  It makes a nice, a little different casserole for a crowd.  I'm glad I didn't give up on it too soon.

My family loved this for Christmas morning breakfast.  I assembled it on Christmas Eve and let it steep in the fridge till morning.  I had plenty of people on diets, so I altered it thus: I made herb bread, cut it into cubes and put the cubes on a dry cookie sheet and baked them at 250 for about 45 min till they were dry and hard.  These were my fat free croutons.  I omitted the butter, used 2%milk cheddar cheese (lower fat, all the flavor), 1 large egg + 1-1/2 cups Egg Beaters, skim milk, 1 cup low fat real bacon bits.  I added 2 TB minced onion.  I assembled the dish thus: I layed the croutons on the bottom of the baking dish, covered them with the cheese, then poured the combined rest of the ingredients over the crouton/cheese foundation.  I baked the dish covered with foil for 1 hr and a half, then uncovered for 30 more minutes.  I've had requests to serve this on the weekends.  New staple in our house!

Made this recipe, used turkey bacon and 1 chicken breast (cut up), and an extra egg.  Don't over bake this as it becomes dry.  Used seasoned croutons - yum!

OMG! This is a great recipe for breakfast.  Fast to make and you can change the flavors each time, depending on what kind of croutons or meat you use.

No Joke - You can play with this recipe !!  I didn't have croutons nor hash browns...tho..I had three small white rose potatoes - diced and seasoned them up with with seasoning salt and black pepper...then sauteed with some finely chopped onions and a couple minced garlic cloves in the butter - let cool...then put in bottom of baking dish (no need to grease or spray dish itself)...then egg mixture...then bacon - added cheese on top for only a few minutes at the very end of cooking time - outcome not greasy whatsoever - just simply delicious !!

Really good. I didn't have a green pepper but I did have some little green onions so I used that instead. We liked it a lot and I think we'll stick with using the onions in the future.

I made this for breakfast for some friends just before we went on a trip. I used the hashbrowns with the onions & peppers instead of croutons and also added chopped tomatoes and spinach. Used 14 eggs as another reviewer recommended and a 9x13 pan. Had to bake it about 15 min. longer (maybe it was my oven) but it came out perfect. Our friends raved & said it was the best breakfast casserole they'd ever had. Will be making this again!

Really good.  Adding in some onions and just cooked them with peppers and a whole pack of chopped up bacon.  Added in turkey sausage links chopped up.  Added this mixture on top of 8 instead of 6 eggs and used mozzarellla and cheddar.

I don't know why it took me so long to make this breakfast, but boy is it good!

Per the suggestions of other reviewers and the author, I used this recipe as a baseline and really made my own changes along the way. Instead of using bacon, I browned one pound of maple sausage; I added mushrooms and onions and sauteed them with the peppers. Instead of croutons, I used 3 cups of crusty cubed bread. Also, I more than doubled the number of eggs - I used about 14 or 15 eggs. I didn't feel like 6 eggs was going to be enough to give the dish the egg substance it needed.

I made this for a group of friends and everyone raved about it! I would certainly recommend and make again.

This was a big hit Christmas morning even mention of making it a tradition.  I didn't make it the night before as planned because the fridge was already too full but it was still excellent!  I think it would be even better if it had had the night to let all the yummy flavours develop.

I make this for Christmas morning. Delicious! I used a little more bacon because I had it left from another recipe. When the bacon was done, I poured off the fat but cooked 1/2 of a  small onion in the residue and added that to the egg/ pepper mixture. Also used seasoned organic croutons and upped the eggs to 8 and the milk to 2 cups as suggested by others. This is really good and easy for Christmas morning when you are running around doing other things. Pop it into the oven and you are good to go!

Great flavors and better the next day.  I used bob evans sausage instead of bacon and through in some bell peppers and onion.  The croutons add so much to this.  This is my new go-to brunch recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I also allowed this to sit over night.  I added sausage and peporoni along with the bacon.  I also through in some mushrooms.  I made half with the crutons and half with fried potatoes (the ones in the freezer section).  It was better with potatoes, but both were very good. This is worth trying.

This is FABULOUS!!! This is the perfect recipe to add to or take away from depending on what you have in your kitchen. I added onion, and mixed in a few handfuls of potatoes, chopped ham and fresh mushrooms. It was delish!! I made it last night and all I had to do was pop it into the oven this morning. Perfect. The egg mixture was creamy and the croutons weren't soggy. I will make this again and again!! Thanks so much for a great, tasty and different breakfast!!

As others have stated, this is a really good base recipe that can be tweeked for use with other meats, veggies and cheeses. We love breakfast but seldom make it at home. Too much hassle trying to get everyone eating together with everything hot at the same time. This recipe resolves that issue. I used 6 slices bacon and 1/2 of a 1 lb tube of Jimmy Dean ground sausage. Cooked the bacon till browned but not crisp, cut into 1 in pieces. Browned sausage, then added 1/2 cup onion, sauteed till translucent. Stirred in the bacon and removed from heat. Used 9x13 pan, sprayed with Pam. Used garlic and onion croutons, topped with 2 cups cheddar jack cheese. Used 7 eggs (due to the larger pan size). Skipped the bell pepper. Used dijon mustard. Seasoned with salt, seasoned pepper and garlic powder. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is my husband said that it reminded him of McDonald's breakfast burrito. He still had seconds..but the remark stuck with me. Next time I will try this with bagels instead of croutons. Or maybe potatoes.

I made this for dinner using up some left over ham instead of the bacon and about a half bag of baby spinach instead of the peppers.  A bag of Stove Top Stuffing worked in lieu of the croutons.   Overnight the whole thing set up and it was even better for breakfast than it had been for dinner.

This is a great casserole for Christmas Day, New Year Brunch, or when serving guests.  I made this last night and left it in the fridge.  I popped it in the oven this morning and it was done in 40 minutes, as the recipe said.  It smelled divine while it was cooking.  The cable guy kept commenting on it...Now he and my husband are having some in the family room in front of the TV!  The dish is so eye catching and colorful, I wish I had taken a picture!

This was fantastic!  East to put together and tasted delish.  Even the fussy one sampled and went for his own serving.  Thank You for the recipe

This is a great dish. I used herbed croutons to give it that much more flavor. Give this one a try.

This is my "go to" recipe for holiday brunches since it's so easy to prepare and doesn't take up a shelf in the fridge overnight. I always eliminate the butter and sometimes the bell pepper (my son doesn't like it). I use Hormel bacon pieces or sometimes I'll crisp ham or canadian bacon if I'm out of bacon pieces. Yummy delicious and so simple!!

I chose this recipe for a recent potluck breakfast we had at work. Following the advice of a reviewer, I decided to make 1-1/2 recipes for a 9x13 casserole. BEWARE: 40 minutes is NOT long enough for that much to get cooked thoroughly. Serving a runny egg casserole was a humbling experience to say the least. IF, and that's a big IF, I ever make this again, I will probably make the smaller recipe as written or maybe use ramekins.

I've used stuffing mix as recommended by other readers and diced ham in place of bacon to eliminate a step and dirty pan. This is the quickest, simplest breakfast recipe out there and always delivers raves and smiles.

Umm-mmm!  This is a great dish.  Made it for Christmas morning and it was a hit.  My variation however, is I had to lose the red/green peppers due to picky eater(s).  I substituted artichoke hearts being we are in California and we love artichokes.  It was perfect.

I also make it the night before as suggested by earlier comments.  I do want to try it by baking it promptly rather than it setting overnight as I would like to see if the croutons remain crunchy.  BTW, I used garlic & butter croutons.  Great compliment to the other flavors.

Used Texas Toast garlic and cheese croutons, cooked bacon until done (not cripsy), and put in the fridge overnight.  Easy to prepare and tasty.  Served with Tabasco sauce, next time I will add cayenne to the recipe.  Will make again.

I made this for Mothers Day and everyone enjoyed it.  I added about two tbls. of  mayo to my milk and egg mixture.  This makes the eggs creamier.  I foumd this tip when I was looking for a great scrambled egg recipe and I have used it ever since.

Used 8 eggs instead of 6. Make sure the croutons are seasoned. Would also be good with ham instead of bacon and with a little diced onion added. Nice alternative to my regular breakfast casserole.

I made this for Christmas breakfast--it was good. It has a quiche-like consistency. I used caesar salad croutons and red bell pepper. I also halved the recipes and it still took 45 minutes to cook. Good!

Delicious.  I doubled the recipe and took 1/2 to brunch and saved the other 1/2 to eat for breakfast during the week.  It held up well in the refrigerator and tasted great re-heated even 3 days later!  Will definitely make again and again.

This is easy and excellent, especially when you have company.  I cheated and used the real bacon bits from the salad aisle instead of cooking my own.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Fantastic!!  I halved the recipe for an 8x8 pan.  Added an extra egg and a little more milk and let sit overnight.  Brought to room temperature before baking and it was great!!  Also used my own homemade garlic parmesan croutons.  YUM!

I made this and the only thing I didnt like was that it was a little spongy.  I have had one before that almost had a pizza crust bottom but not as crunchy and I liked that much better.  It was just a little mushy but the flaor was great.  I didnt let mine sit overnight either.  I added bell pepper and onion and that made the flavor perfect.  I think it needs to be cooked for a little over an our to maybe give a little more crunch to the bottom layer.

Made this recipe Sat night and baked it Sunday morning. I did change the recipe alittle - added red peppers instead of green, used 8 eggs instead of 6 and 2 cups of milk..... and then added mushrooms. (croutons - used the cheese and garlic flavor... 1 6oz box was the right amount) It fit into a 7x11 size pan perfectly. My family liked the flavor, but thought the texture was alittle too spongy. Will try it again, but will let it sit for only a couple hours before I bake it. (It took me an hour to bake this ????)

I'm Scott M. (Now Scottley), and I'm glad so many of you like this recipe.  I'm especially proud that many of you make this as a holiday dish because it's perfect for just such events.  And with Christmas just around the corner, I hope many more of you will try this recipe.  It lends itself well to breakfast, brunch, lunch or even dinner.  If bacon isn't your thing, try it with country ham, your favorite sausage, shrimp, or even smoked salmon layered-in for an unexpected surprise.  Served with crispy pan-seared hashbrowns, some fresh fruit, and a flute of mimosa (or OJ and giner ale for the little ones), it might make you a rock star in your own kitchen.

I added one egg, but otherwise followed the the directions exactly.  I had to increase the cooking time!  It was very runny until I cooked it about 15 minutes extra. But, it was worth the wait!

I assembled this last night and popped in the oven this morning. My husband and I both LOVED it! This will be perfect when we have overnight guests and don't want to fuss around in the kitchen in the morning. I used two jars of diced pimento instead of the bell peppers. Also added some green onion. Yum!!!

I would give this recipe more than five stars.  The only problem with it was it was too good, and I didn't have enough for latecomers to our brunch party!  I doubled the recipe (and added four extra eggs, but only used two cups cheese).  I substituted mushrooms for bacon, and it was great.  I will make this again soon!   Thanks!

I brought this dish to an office party and EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  It was really tasty, even if you're not a big fan of eggs!  I doubled the recipe; baked it in the same size dish but only put in half of each large bell pepper (red and green for color).  Great!

My boyfriend called it a breakfast casserole magic. I used a layer of shredded potatoes instead of croutons, but I will try croutons next time. Then I put a layer of shredded cheese, green chile, sliced olives, chopped ham, then cheese again, then poured the egg and onion mixture over the whole thing, more shredded cheese and the crumbled bacon. For the onion in the egg, I chopped onion real fine and cooked it down in the pan with the bacon. Then I scooped it out of the bacon pan and added it to the eggs. I would add a little milk to the eggs next time.

Important to set casserole at room temp, 1 hour ahead. I added two more eggs and 1/4 cup of milk. Yessssss, use cheese garlic croutons. Soak overnight. Flavors are incorporated!! Yummy! It was served at our church meet/ greet breakfast! High rave reviews. I cooked it at 325 degrees for 30 mins and then @ 350 degrees for an additional 20 min. I got asked to make this dish again!!

DELICIOUS :)Everyone,from my 10yr. old to my Mom&Pop, loved this dish. It's easy to make and goes quickly. I've made 2. One, I baked immediately, the other, I placed in fridge to bake the next morning. Though they were both great, the overnight one was scrumptious. And it does reheat very well, though not many made it to the microwave, lol :)For breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Next time I'll add sausage, potatoes,red&yellow peppers...just can't go wrong with this dish. Kudos

Looking for an awesome breakfast casserole? This is the one! Delicious and not soggy like many others. I've also included shredded hash browns (with the croutons) & it's even better that way.

Delicious! Used bacon, cheese, finely diced red pepper and potatoes. Next time I will fry the potatoes first for an extra bit of crunch and add the bacon before cooking. As recommended by others, I let the mixture sit overnight before baking. I also baked in a smaller dish to make the portions taller. Increased the baking time to accommodate this change. Yum!

This was excellent. I also prepared the night before and threw it in the oven the next morning. I really like the idea of using croutons instead of regular old bread. Family loved it.

This is my Christmas morning staple for the past 3 years and I just made it for a Fathers Day brunch as well. Always a hit! I have never put the bacon in it (or any meat for that matter), but have added sauteed spinach, mushrooms, broccoli...so easy to add whatever is in the fridge and everything has always been delish. For Fathers Day, I did sauteed mushrooms with fresh chives from the garden. Yum! I always make the night before, then just pop it in the oven in the morning. Super simple. Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent! I added 1 onion and sautéed onion and bell pepper 5 mins in the butter in microwave then stirred in with croutons. I used 7 eggs and 2 cups milk. I let it set for an hour or so before I baked it. Served it with sour cream, salsa and avocado. The seasoned croutons gave it so much flavor, gonna be a favorite here now :)

Loved it, I followed the recipe exactly with no changes other than the servings. It was very easy and didn't take too long since I put most of it together while the bacon baked. We will have this one again and again!

This recipe is the BEST EVER breakfast casserole.  i changed several things.. didn't have crutons... so cubed fresh bread and placed on a cookie sheet under the broiler just till slightly toasted.. i probably used 5 cups up bread cubes.. then i drizzled the butter over the top, used Ham instead of bacon, sliced up fresh mushrooms and diced yellow and red pepper... prob used 8 eggs and then 2 C milk the rest i did as i was suppose to i think :) - def one i will make over and over again - even for dinner. - oh ya and i never let it sit overnight.. made it and popped it straight into the oven... served it with stewed tomato's .... enjoy

This is a great recipe. We use 12 eggs to make it a little more hearty, add feta cheese sprinkled in, and don't use any butter. Works great! My husband loves it! Bake for 1 hour if you use 12 eggs.

It was a hit at our brunch!  I made it the day before and refrigerated overnight.  My adjustments:  I used garlic & cheese croutons, yellow and red bell peppers, and added 2 more eggs and 1/4 cup milk like other reviewers recommended.  Also, didn't crisp the bacon since it gets 40 minutes in the oven.  Everything else stayed the same.  Thanks!

Made this for our Christmas Eve Day brunch.  Excellent choice!  Used 8 eggs and added finely chopped portabellas and seasoned croutons.  Put in the fridge overnight.  Had great flavor.  A keeper recipe.

I have made this several times with many different variations.  It is a great recipe that can be modified per your tastes and it still comes out great.  A couple of important things.  
- Definitely use seasoned Croutons or a good Deli gourmet bread. 
- Definitely prepare the night before and then bake in the morning.

It was very good, but I wish it was a bit fluffier.  Used fat free seasoned croutons, 1/3 fat bacon, and Dijon mustard.  The taste of the mustard was a little strong, I think next time I'll reduce it to 2 tsp.

this is a great base dish, get creative and find the mixture that works for you.  I made this christmas morning and while everyone told me it was great I am concocting an even better version with mushroom, extra bacon, onions, garlic, and potatoes with a bit of Old Bay.  Followed a suggestion and cut leftovers into small portions and bagged it and put it in the freezer.  Now the boys have something easy to grab and microwave in the morning.  Great

I am so glad I tried this recipe for a brunch.  It's quick and easy and got great reviews.   I'm not sure I'd add much salt to taste, though.  With the cheese and bacon it was well seasoned.  Great recipe.

I have made this several times and have taken it to our Lady's Ministry meetings.  It is always success and nothing left to take home. Many have asked for this  recipe!  We Baptist women love to eat!  Thanks it was delicious and I have put it in "my favorite recipes".  It was perfect just like it was, I made no changes!

Delicious!!!  I did use a blend of cheeses that I had on hand - mozzerella, swiss & monterrey jack, no other changes though.    Took to work and shared, co-workers LOVED it.

I made this last Saturday and we liked it so much I've made it 3 times since then. Excellent!!  I halved the recipe but used 4 eggs in am 8x8 pan with the same cooking time. Tried it with toast when I ran out of croutons, the croutons were definitely better.

It was great....if I were more of a breakfast person it would probably get 5 stars!.  I let the croutons soak up the milk and eggs overnight as suggested by some others.  I also used sausage instead of bacon.  It actually got even better the longer it sat!

This is Paul and I reviewed this recipe back on the 3rd I believe, after looking more closely at the recipe, I was wrong (hey I admit it) eggs yummy was made with mixing 1/2 cup of milk and a can of cream of mushroom soup spread on top and then add the cheese. At that point you can actually put it in the frig and cook it later. It is also even better as leftovers. Paul P. S. Sorry Charleston

This gets a 5 because it tastes great and you cannot mess this up. Follow the directions as is.  It tasted great and was a big hit with all my guests.  If you double it then put the second one in a second pan.  Get the seasoned croutons.

I just made this for a teacher breakfast and everyone loved it. I had requests for the recipe.  I did let it sit over night and had to add additional eggs. It is a great basic recipe that you can easily modify with your favorite breakfast meats, veggies and cheeses. It's  a keeper.

I thought this was great.  I used flavored garlic croutons and up'd the eggs by 2 since I was putting it in the fridge over night to cook the next morning.  Very good and I am not the biggest fan of bell pepper but it gave it a really nice taste.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks.

This is easily the best meal my boyfriend and I have made together.  Since it's only the two of us we cut the recipe in half.  It still comes out just as tasty.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who loves eggs, cheese, bacon, and heaven mixed together into one bite.

This was great!  I made it this morning, Christmas!  Everyone loved it.  I used bacon instead of ham and also grated some onion, which gave it a great flaver without my husband knowing onion was in it!  Will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Not bad at all but made this for a group of about 20 people.  Followed the recipe completely and not one comment about it.  It was hardly eaten.  I think perhaps it was because there were too many other items on the buffet table.  
I would think this recipe would be best as a stand alone item without competition.

This was a pleasant meal for dinner.  It was really easy to make and dinner was on the table really quick that evening.  It wasn't the best breakfast casserole I've had, but the fact that you don't have to wait overnight is a bonus in this recipes favor.

I made this for a baby shower and got many compliments. Lots of people were asking for the recipe. I used green pepper instead of red (personal preference) and it was really great!

I made this for our fathers Day Breakfast feast.  everyone LOVED it!  The only thing we didnt add was the peppers as my DH doesnt like them.  Funny thing is that we use this site all the time and he gets so frustrated when people say they love the recipe but "change" this or that...so it isnt even the recipe at all!  Omitting one item is OK..but PLEASE if you substitute..or delete or add this or that..then make a new recipe  LOL..other that that..this is wonderful!  we had home fires on the side..and it was awesome!

This is a great recipe!  The first time I made it was for a work treat day.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't have enough time to bake it the night before, so I refrigerated it and baked it in the morning.  I received a lot of compliments.  Thanks for the recipe

This is a very flavorful recipe.  I read the reviews before making and debated about including the crutons.  I ended up using them, and though I liked it very much, my husband who is picky about textures didn't like them.  So next time I will try hashbrowns instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

I got SO many compliments on this. I used 2 cups of milk and 7 eggs since I was a bit nervous when I poured on the liquid, it was absorbed so quickly, and it turned out perfect! Everyone liked this one better than the sausage one I usually make. This is definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe for breakfast yesterday for a mom's group meeting at my church.  The entire dish was gone fairly quickly.  I thought it was good, but my first thought was that there was something missing in it for my taste.  I liked it though.  My four year old daughter helped me prepare it the night before, and we let it set in the fridge overnight before baking.  I would make this again to take to another breakfast meeting.  Thanks for sharing!

My family went crazy over this! Hubby always said his mom's breakfast casserole was the best until this recipe. The croutons are the key ingrediant to make this unique! I changed a few things because of what I had on hand and personal preference: Used spicy breakfast sausage instead of bacon and sauteed onions instead of bell pepper, I also added cayenne pepper, onion and garlic powder and totally omitted the melted butter (Promise you dont miss it!) Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

This was good.  I added 2 extra eggs, omitted the bell pepper and added onion.  Mine was a little dry so I am thinking that I cooked it too long.  I made it the night before.  I will make it again but go easier on the cooking time.

Very good for a light dinner instead of breakfast. The only changes that I made were to 1/2 the recipe and make it in a 8X8" pan and I used plain cornbread croutons.  My husband and I loved this easy recipe.  I made it in the morning and cooked it for dinner.

This was a great bfast dish. My family thought it would be even better with applewood smoked bacon and a touch of fresh garlic.  It was so easy to prepare. I made it the night before and heated it up in the oven for about 20 min. It's a new favorite and I will definitely make it again. I will add two extra eggs next time. Awesome and impressive!

We made a dish very similar to this called "Overnight Breakfast Fondue".  The family was never crazy about it because it called for cream of mushroom soup.  This one sounds just right.  The only change I will make (and it would be in keeping with the old recipe) is to cook and crumble a pound of Jimmy Dean pork sausage instead of the bacon.

My coworkers and I just loved this recipe! I did add 2 more eggs as someone suggested. The cool thing is if you let it rest a couple of minutes to set up, you can actually pick it up with you hands like a snacking cake. Seriously 5 stars! Thanks!!!

Very good. Had out of town guests so it was great to prepare this ahead. I served it for a brunch, with Bloody Marys and had a variety of fruit, but I liked it best with a piquante sauce, and loved the leftovers, which I had frozen and later reheated in a skillet, covered, over low heat.

I prepared this for our Church's Men's breakfast picnic. Since I was making this for the first time, I followed the recipe exactly as written. It turned out so good, tasty and easy to assemble. The bacon really did the trick! Leftover would have probaby tasted better. Will make more next time.

I made this for mother's day brunch and it was a big hit.  I did make a few changes after reading the other reviews.  I used 8 large eggs, 2 cups of milk, and cheese and garlic croutons.  I also used thick cut bacon and dijon mustard (I was out of yellow).  I prepared the recipe early in the morning and refrigerated it until I was ready to cook, and then increased the cooking time to 45 minutes.

Try this, it's great! I used cheddar cheese flavored croutons which gave it a richer flavor. Otherwise made the recipe as it reads. I would bake it less than 50 minutes next time. Check it about 42-44 minutes and I think that would be sufficient!  It's Great!!!!

Super easy.  Definitely use one and a half batches of this recipe when baking in a 13 x 9 pan.  Used about 1/2 cup diced red pepper.  Substituting part reduced fat cheddar kept casserole from becoming greasy.  Bakes up lighter in pyrex than a metal pan.  This has a bread pudding type of texture so next time I might add an extra egg to make it "eggier."

Excellent recipe!  I used butter-garlic croutons and added ham.  For quickness and convenience, I used Hormel's bacon in a jar in lieu of cooking/crumbling bacon.  This was so good, my Italian guests wanted the recipe to take back to Italy with them!

This was wonderful.  I didn't have milk, so substituted with a 12 ounce can of evaporated milk plus enough water to equal 1-3/4 cups.  I used half a green pepper, 4 oz. mushrooms and one 6 oz. box of Brownberry Garlic & Onion Croutons. Although not as thick as most breakfast bakes this is good just as it is!  :o)

This was pretty good, mine took a lot longer to cook i think its because of the high altitude so i cooked it for 40 minutes at 325 and then put it up to 400 for 10 more minutes and then it was ok. I will make it again.

This has got to be the best breakfast casserole I've ever tasted.  I made it for a brunch at work and everyone had to have the recipe!  I can't think of anything additional ingredients that would make it any better.

This was pretty good. I even used flavored croutons b/c that's what I had in the pantry! It's a good diversion from the usual breakfast casserole.

This casserole turned out really well.  I was a little unsure about using croutons as the base but it was great!  I made it for a moms' group brunch and it received lots of compliments.

Ok, used seasoned croutons, less green and red pepper (just eyeballed it), used real  bacon bits in the bottle. Made it the night before. The next morning I added 4 more eggs and 1/2 cup more milk and more shredded cheese on top. Was very good. :)

So when I went shopping for this recipe, the only croutons I could find were "seasoned croutons." I reluctantly bought them, worried that it would make the dish weird. DO BUY SEASONED CROUTONS. It made the dish flavorful and savory and perfect. This recipe is amaaaaazing. My husband asks for it every weekend.

This was incredibly easy to make! I've never made an egg casserole before and now I'm ready to do it all over again! I switched from bacon to sausage because my bacon was expired :'( and I added green onions instead of peppers just out of taste preference and boy I feel good about myself it came out so fluffy, airy, cheesy and an overall joy to have produced myself!

This turned out great! Used pepperoni and sausage instead of bacon since that's all we had. The croutons were completely absorbed and didn't taste them but they added flavor and bulk to the dish. Had to cover it about 1/2 way through to prevent the cheese from browning too much and then when done it really puffed up. Thought we were having a soufflé! But that quickly calmed done. It was delicious,

This was a definite bummer at our Christmas breakfast:( The addition of an entire bell pepper and a tablespoon of mustard totally overwhelmed the dish. Soggy croutons do NOT taste good. A light bread and much less of everything would have let the eggs shine through. Crumbling bacon on top...not great. I thought this was a no miss because of the rating. Boy was I wrong. Sticking with the creme brûlée french toast or Giadas lemon egg thing. Sorry this was not good.

This was not bad, but I didn't think it was that great. Yet it was gobbled up at a breakfast buffet party where lots of other food went leftover, and someone asked me for the recipe, so I guess others liked it. I used 10 eggs, as some recommended, but forgot the mustard! (Oops!) I added chopped onion, and red and green bell peppers for Christmas color.

I made this recipe just as it called for except I added a half of a diced sweet onion (I used a red bell pepper).  It was better than the breakfast casserole I've been making for years on Christmas morning for my family.  I did use a slightly smaller dish than 13x9" so it wouldn't be so flat so I did have to leave it in the oven about 10 min longer.  Absolutely delicious!!!! Thanks for the recipe!

We are huge breakfast people but we just didn't care for this. I made 1.5 times the recipe for the larger dish and half wasn't eaten. I think I didn't like the croutons as the breading part of the dish for one thing. May have been better with sausage for more flavor. Don't think I'll try it again. I felt it was a huge waste of great ingredients.

I really just used this recipe as a starting point. I modified it a bit. We try to eat a few more vegetables and I needed to add these to this recipe. 

First, I saluted 1 tbs butter, 1tsp canned pre minced garlic, 1/4 cup of finely chopped onions and 1/3 cup finely chopped ham in a pan. Using the dripping I saluted a handful of each zucchini slices and green bell peppers and green onions. I put about half a broccoli floret in the blender to finely chop it.  I threw all of this in the bowl with the 5 eggs, cheese (I used 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup cheddar) and milk. Beat it together with a whisk. I added salt and pepper. I put it in a smaller oval casserole dish baked for 40 mins at 325. 

I can see this recipe being really easy to modify because I can add different veggies that I have on hand. I will also try a dash of paprika in this recipe in the future.

Made this for my husband and visiting family & it was a hit all around! After reading the reviews I used 9 eggs/2.5 cups of milk. Otherwise I followed recipe. I think I could have used at least another 3 eggs, and maybe another 1/2 cup of milk. Maybe at little cajun seasoning too. It was not dry, just a little flat. I think I will try it with sausage and mushrooms next time as well

My family loves this dish! Followed the recipe except I used. Red pepper so my kids would eat it, and added diced onions. Just fixed it this morning for the first time, and will definitely do again! The red pepper gave it a little bit of a bite, yet a sweetness to it.

I made this and loved it! I added two additional eggs and 1/2 cup of milk just because I was feeding 5 people. And I did make it the night before. I also just put bacon on half for those that didn't want bacon on theirs. And I used ready cooked bacon to save some time.

My family didn't care for this. It might have been the croutons I used. I thought the flavor was good, but a little too greasy.

I had to change it a little; what I had on hand. I added onions, mushrooms, spicy brown mustard, and maple flavored sausage. Very good. Thinking mix time I will add spicy sausage!

I have made this and omitted the croutons and added hashbrown potato patties in the bottom of pan and the poured mixture over them and baked. It was really good!!

I didn't like this.  The croutons get really mushy and stay that way even when baked.  I HATE mushy things.  The whole thing was quite runny even tho I baked it 15 min longer than called for.

Absolutely  love this recipe! My husband and kids love it too. I have been making this for years now. I make this Christmas morning because it is so easy to make and everyone loves it. I use pre-cooked crumbled bacon/bits because it makes it extra easy to make. I add half a small onion and only use 1/4 of a green pepper because my boys aren't that fond of the peppers. So yummy I have even made this camping on the barbecue. Thanks for the recipe :)

It was good, but not as wonderful as some people here have said.  If I make it again, I would add onions, a sharper cheese, and more mustard.

This was pretty tasty. I subbed onions for the green pepper but otherwise I kept it the same. I think I would prefer using chunks of french bread in place of the croutons next time.

I followed the recipe exactly, except used turkey bacon.  I put it together on Christmas Eve to serve Christmas morning, when everything is so hectic.  We all LOVED it so much, I made it again for New Year's morning!  Wonderful, especially with garlic-cheese flavored croutons!

You bet it is a crowd pleasing recipe!!  I made this last night using the garlic cheese croutons & taking the suggestion of other reviewers, let it refrigerate overnight.  I used ham, small diced red & green diced peppers & onions.  The people loved the flavor, and I believe it came from the croutons.  The eggs were increased to 9.  I cooked the bacon until crispy and crumbled it on the top after the dish was pulled out of the oven. I was ready with copies of the recipe for those who asked.  Thanks Scott!

Made for a birthday at work and it was a hit.  Cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan.  It did need the full 40 minutes to bake.  I didn't measure the croutons just poured enough to cover the bottom of the pan an inch deep.  Used spicy Italian sausage and it was great!!!!

I made this breakfast casserole because I had ll the ingredients in my kitchen. However, I had to make a few adjustments because what I had was not exactly what the recipe called for. I used resturant style croutons, mexican style cheese, maple cured bacon, and a frozen mix of onions and peppers. It turned out amazing. Definitely different but different in a good way. I don't think I have ever tasted anyting like it! I did not thaw out the onions and peppers just mixed them in and baked them.

This was very good. I used real bacon pieces from the salad section instead of cooking my own bacon and it tasted great! My family of 2 adults and 3 kids ate the whole pan! Will make this one again for sure!

I loved this.  It was easy and the croutons made it just a bit different from most other casseroles.  My kids, however, did not care for it.  Too grown-up for them.

This is the second time that I have made this casserole.  Both times RAVED reviews.  I usually make two pans.  One with turkey bacon and the other with pork sausage.  I follow the recipe, only adjusting because I double it in each pan.  It comes out good everytime.

This is an easy dish to make on a Saturday morning and very flavourful! I made it with black forest ham instead of bacon and gave it a dash of parmesan on top. Only used half a pepper (orange) and it turned out awesome! Also used 8 eggs and 2 cups of milk -- served four substantial servings -- not 8. Will have to try for Christmas morning.

I made this for a church function and it was very well received.  I was doubling the recipe so I used five bags of croutons, based on the package contents. I drizzled the butter over the croutons as directed, and then I put sauteed onions and red peppers, and the cheese over the croutons before adding the egg/milk mixture.  We started out with 12 eggs and I ended up adding six more eggs and more milk  to get a better liquid to crouton ratio.  It received many compliments!

Very very good and easy!  I halved the recipe for just my husband and I.  I did add in an extra egg, a splash more milk, only 1 tsp of mustard, a generous pinch of salt, and 10 turns of the pepper grinder.  I think I'll make it with sausage next time, because the bacon ended up a little tough for us.  This recipe is a great canvas for lots of variations!

Wow, this is the first breakfast casserole I've made that actually tasted well seasoned.  I used the Texas Toast brand garlic butter croutons and let it sit overnight.  So good and EASY!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  This is soooo tasty!  I did read the recommended tweaks and adjusted mine accordingly.  Here are the changes I made:

2 small bags of real bacon pieces (instead of sliced bacon)
4 cups of croutons (instead of 3 cups)
1 bag of shredded cheese (instead of 2 cups)
Thin layer of garlic powder
Thin layer of minced onions (green onions would be good too!)
2 cups milk (instead of 1 3/4 cups)
8 eggs (instead of 6 eggs)

I prepared it the night before and cooked it as directed (325 for 40 minutes) and let is rest for an additional 10 minutes.  I have never received so many compliments to a recipe!  REALLY, REALLY good!!!

I thought this was pretty good. I liked the croutons, but there was something missing. I think next time I will add some breakfast sausage to the mix. Needs a little more crunch so might add a little something extra next time. But the flavors were good.

I made this for Christmas morning. I let it sit in refrigerator overnight and popped it in the oven in the morning. My 4 boys ,husband and mother in law all loved it! They asked for it to be our Christmas tradition. The only change I made was to use nitrate-free turkey bacon from Fresh Market.

I NEVER get breakfast casseroles right but this was was a BIG hit for Christmas morning!!  I did make it the night before as stated in other reviews and I added onions.  I bought the precooked bacon and it turned out great.  It's a keeper!!

I made the 8x8" version of this and it was perfect.  6 slices bacon, 2 Tbs of butter, enough croutons to cover bottom of dish, 1 cup cheese, 4 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1/2 bell pepper, 1/2 tbs of mustard.  It cooked for exactly 40 mins.  You won't be dissapointed.

Really good we followed the advice and added a couple extra eggs and a 1/4 cup more milk since we were soaking over night for Christmas morning. We used a green pepper and you could taste it pretty good so if you really don't like that taste much you might want to reduce that a little. I loved it! Maybe added a couple extra pieces of bacon also because bacon is good!!

Made this Dec. 24th for Christmas morning (let it sit overnight)...It was deliciously naughty and terrible for you!  I did add several more eggs.  I also added some frozen hashbrowns.  I guess if you're used to this type of food you won't mind the heavy brick of heart attack sitting in your stomach!

Great recipe. Very easy to put together.  Like others I prepare it the night before and place in the refrigerator until morning.  Used unthawed peppers from this past summer's garden.  Have made a couple of times now and always is delicious.

I made this for a brunch this a.m.  The ladies loved it and all asked for the recipe.  I assembled it last evening and refrigerated overnight.  Substituted sauteed onions for the pepper and used cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  I left out the salt since the bacon,cheese, and croutons seemed to provide more than enough.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for this great recipe-it's a keeper!

Followed recipe exactly, but took advice of other readers and used "seasoned" croutons and add some shredded parmesan cheese.  Turned out really good.  Made it for a Sunday brunch with some friends and everyone really enjoyed it.  I ate leftovers the next day, and didn't enjoy it as much though.

I did not like the soggy croutons on the bottom and it was a very strong flavor. That was probably the flavor of croutons I used. Maybe if I cook the croutons first then add ingredients as I had read.

This is my first rating of a recipe on this site.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave instead of a skillet and used a mixture of shredded cheese that I had available.  Although I'm not a fantastic cook, my out-of-town houseguests thought this dish was amazing.  Thanks for sharing.

I used garlic croutons and left out the green pepper because of the kids.  Even my 5 year old, who eats anything was picking at this casserole. Will not be making this again.

i thought the egg to milk ratio was perfect in this one. I kinda wondered about the croutons but this was delicious. I used ham bacon and sausage instead of just bacon and everyone loved this last chrismas. I will be making it this christmas also !

This is such a versatile and delicious recipe!!  I usually purchase the seasoned croutons, then use either sausage or ham and occasionally use sausage, ham and bacon to make a meat lovers breakfast casserole.  Simply a great breakfast casserole!!

This was great! I made it for a brunch and it fed 6 people. It did have a pizza taste to it, as sometone else mentioned. I used turkey bacon and made it the night before. It came out really nice. Although, I would use a bit more melted butter on the seasoned croutons. Some of my croutons came out a little crunchy. But, it was still really good! Otherwise, I wouldn't alter the recipe one bit.

I made this Christmas morning and it was a hit!  I used Italian-style croutons, which went very well.  And the mustard is a nice kick that doesn't overpower.  Great recipe, will make again!

I agree with Kellie M's review. 

Followed this recipe to a tee and came out with very little overall flavor and spongy texture once colled down. 

It's like the croutons nutralize things too much and take out most of the flavor. 

Ideas would be chunks of tomato, grape tomatoes, chopped sun dried tomatoes,  and definately needs the flavor of  processed cheese slices flavor inside.

Not sure that would cook well though. Needs more salty/sweet flavor. some left over hame chops would be great. Added salt even. 

Maybe 2 min before taking out of oven, cover the top with proceesed cheese slices, bacon cuts/ham, sund dried tomato mixture over cheese clices, when cheese is melted half way, take out.

That would make it taste good. Would also cut half of the cheese inside the casorole.

This was so easy to make. The flavor reminded me of pizza for some reason. I used garlic butter crutons, and made it in a 8x8 using 4 eggs and 1C of milk. I had to cook it for about 50 minutes, until the center finally puffed up. Such a great recipe for our family since I almost always have all the ingredients on hand and we love breakfast food. Great recipe.

Super easy to modify for individual tastes.  Add 2 to 4 extra eggs, half or leave out butter, and let sit overnight in refrigerator.  Wonderful.

My husband enjoyed this breakfast casserole. When I asked him what he thought he answered, "This is good." This usually means that he likes it but it needs a little something extra. I did let it sit overnight as another reviewer suggested. I think I will play around with this one some to try and personalize it. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Very good.  I used a red bell pepper and I also spread some shredded hash brown potatoes on top (I put them in a bag with butter before so they were able to crisp when they cooked and not burn).  Very filling!

Great base recipe for our house.  I omitted the peppers, but hubby would have like to have them in it anyway.  SO next time I will put the peppers in half of it.  I also used 9 eggs and only 1C. of milk.  I took another members suggestion and used hashbrowns instead of croutons.  I sauteed onions in butter  and put them over the hashbrowns, but it was too much, so next time I will season the potatoes a little different.  Great recipe, we even ate leftovers!!  Great touched up with a little Texas Pete or Tobasco!
Thanks!!

I cubed and toasted a day old loaf of french bread while the oven was preheating, sauted a large onion in the bacon grease with the red pepper. Used 10 eggs and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. Was perfectly cooked after an hour. We loved it! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious - even the leftovers are great.  Followed recipe exactly except that my casserole dish was an 8x8. I used the full amount of the recipe and had to cook it for 70 minutes.  Thanks submitter - this is a keeper - Next time I will add some onions to it.

Are the croutons suppose to come out soggy? I was hoping for a nice, crispy base. I made the croutons in the oven myself before hand, so I'm not sure if this made a difference. I think I prefer my egg to be firmer and more like a quiche consistency. (I added 7 eggs to 1 & 3/4C cup of milk.) I will reduce the amount of milk next time. The flavours were nice though - I added zuchinni to the mixture.

I had some italian bread, so I used the garlic croutons recipe from this site and omitted the garlic from one batch.  

The croutons were great, the casserole had a nice flavor and was easy to make, but none of my family would eat it because it was a little soggy.  I followed the directions to the letter and I didn't think it was as soggy as some casseroles I've eaten before (I didn't like those at all).  

I wish there was a way to make a wonderful casserole without the sog!!

Pretty Good! Instead of croutons, I used Pepperidge Farms Country Style stuffing mix. I found that using this, I did not need to add any additional seasoning. On complaint is the bacon was way over done by being browned first and then in the oven for 40 minutes, but it was still tasty!

This recipe was really good.  I doubled it because my glass baking pan is 10.25 x 14.50 inches and other readers said they made 1.5 times the recipe for the 9 x 12 pan.  I also made it the night before and then removed it from the fridge for about an hour before baking to bring it to room temp.  I had to bake it for a little over an hour for it to set up, but it does taste wonderful with the garlic and cheese croutons.  I'll make this again and just allow more time for baking.

Great recipe as is (hence the 5 stars) and also adapts well.  I have added tomatillo salsa and sour cream for the red pepper and milk, and countless other variations.   Definitely a keeper--everyone always wants the recipe!!  Oh, have used with stuffing mix as well as croutons--works great.

Good casserole once I added in a few more eggs and more milk.  I think the original recipe must be wrong, because there's simply no way that could be enough for this casserole.

I made this when my family came out for Thanksgiving.  It was a huge hit!  My husband just ate it up.  Since some in my family don't like peppers,I only put them on one half of the casserole. Turned out GREAT!  I will make this again for sure!!

This is simply the best!  So easy and always a crowd pleaser.  I always add some dry herbs (parsley, basil, etc...whatever you got!) and for the holidays green AND red peppers are a must!

This is a great recipe!  I used sausage instead of bacon with great results!  Also added one chopped onion with the green pepper and cut the butter to 2 Tablespoons.  Used the butter to sautee the vegetables and then sprinkled all on top of the croutons.  YUMMY!

Thank you Scott, This is wonderful. We used this casserole at a scouting event. It was gone real fast. We added onions to this and it was fantastic.

I loved this! Instead of croutons, I just tore up some Italian bread, and 'toasted' it in the oven. I also saved a bit of time by microwaving the bacon. We had this with sauteed garlic mushrooms for a delicious Sunday brunch. Thanks so much, Scott!

I took this casserole to church and it was gone within minutes.  Everyone seemed to love it.  I added mushrooms and just a few diced onions.  I had to cook it a little longer than 40 minutes.  I may try a little less milk next time.  Great recipe!

Great basic recipe - I added fresh mushrooms, green onion and just a sprinkle of hot sauce. I plan on making this again, however, I'm still in search of the ultimate breakfast casserole!

Made this for a brakfast party. I had to increase the recipe because we had a lot of guests. I also added tomato, and sauteed onions. I was not at all impressed with this. I was expecting something a little more "breakfasty," - I just couldn't get past the croutons. Everyone else loved it though - they ate it all.

The "hardest" part of this recipe was frying the bacon!  I made this the night before and baked it in the morning and the eggs were stayed very fluffy.  Easy and delicious!

Great recipe!  I followed other suggestions and doubled the recipe, used mexican blended cheeses and added a couple shots of hot sauce.  At the same time made a single recipe and cooked it in a smaller dish.  All were delicious, it's a keeper. (BTW, you can't have too much bacon.)

This was a pretty good breakfast casserole, but I have tasted better.  I think maybe using sausage instead of bacon would have been better maybe.  I don't know really.... just wasn't really that impressed.  Sorry!

Best breakfast casserole I've done. Made my own croutons and put on garlic powder and parsley. Also added some minced onion to the mixture. Get your slice quick. This disappears fast.

This turned out amazing! I was so skeptical when I read about using the croutons but they MADE the dish! I used more croutons than the recipe called for (maybe 1 1/2 times as much). So delicious.

Made this for a guest brunch. Everyone loved it. I used Pepperidge Farm stuffing cubes, added finely diced onions and garlic pepper. Baked 20 minutes, let cool and refrigerated overnight. Continued baking the next morning covered with foil. Reheated leftovers the following morning. Tasted great!

I needed an extra egg for the mixture possibly because I made the recipe in individual casserole dishes for ease in serving and to cut down the baking time.  It was delicious.   This would be a great recipe to have on hand if you find unexpected guests for breakfast and want something easy and tasty to serve them.

Turned out amazing!  I made this to feed 12 residents at a low income senior apartment complex in Denver.  I had finished packing up the take-out boxes and my kids wandered over and started picking at what was left in the pan.  I got "This is the best breakfast ever!  Will you make us one for tomorrow?"  Coming from a kid who has never liked a single breakfast casserole.  Made another one last night, and put it in the fridge to set overnight.  It's in the oven now.  This is the only breakfast casserole I will make from now on.  Never looking back.

Delicious! Using flavored croutons is what makes it. I used Trader Joe’s cheese and garlic croutons. I halved the recipe, and prepped the night before to put in the fridge so it would be easy to pop in the oven. Others who made it ahead suggested using more eggs because the croutons soak up the liquid. I did that, plus I was using fresh farm eggs which are smaller than store bought,

Company loved it!  I'm wondering if this would work with hash browns replacing the croutons on the bottom....Was a little 'bready-y' for me.  Otherwise, great veggie/egg/bacon combo.

Turned out delish! I prepped it the night before, cooked it in the morning for 60 min (straight from the fridge). I followed the recipe but used about 1.5x ingredients. I used garlic/cheese croutons. It was super tasty. Next time I’ll add more bell pepper.

Made it for the third time. Used home made croutons, mix of cheddar and mozzarella and breakfast sausage instead of bacon. Mixed small amount of cheese, small amount of bacon crumbles, left over chopped tomato and left over chopped onion. Reduced milk to one cup and a splash to allow for the tomato and onion moisture. Guests came for drinks and fajitas. Insisted on micro waving leftovers before we did the fajitas. Guests took home leftovers leaving me a small piece. This recipe is very versatile and very tasty.

This was amazing! The only change I made was substituting left over pre cooked biscuits. I also didn't use red peppers because my family doesn't care for peppers. Other than that I followed the recipe and will make it again for sure!

Made this with seasoned croutons and let sit overnight in the refrigerator.  Used 8 eggs and 2 cups of milk.  Added sauteed red bell pepper, mushrooms, yellow onion and fresh baby spinach.  Everyone loved it!

This was superb.  I cut the following in half to get the calories down, same results. It was great. No butter use seasoned croutons 2 cups. 6 strips of bacon. Added mushrooms and purple onions or any other veggie, I served it with sliced tomatoes and apple sauce This makes it light but filling without all the calories in the original recipe. This made 6 large servings

Love this dish!  My grandma used to make a similar dish and I’ve used this one for several years.  Sometimes I use precooked sausage or bacon for faster prep time.  I also think flavored croutons and some extra seasonings make a big difference!

This was a real hit with our group.  Made it almost exactly like the recipe except that I added a couple more eggs and a little extra milk.  When I do it again I will be adding some additional spices.  This seems to be the type of recipe that is hard to mess up.

I made this for our church's Easter sunrise service breakfast--and it was wonderful!  My only change was that I baked it a little longer--I had a second breakfast casserole that needed to go an hour, and since they were essentially the same base recipe, I baked them together, and both came out perfect.

I'll DEFINITELY be making this again!

For anyone wondering, this does freeze well. I make this for my son in college. I usually use the Smithfield ham that is already diced in the package instead of bacon and just mix in with the eggs. I also add an extra egg or two. I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before I bake. The milk soaks into the croutons that way. Bake and divide into containers when cooled and freeze. He thaws in the mini fridge at school for a couple of days before he reheats in the microwave. I make a lot of freezer meals for him and he always asks for more of this.

Made this for the kiddos at work. They loved it, as did the teachers. This is a great dish for large crowds...potlucks...brunch!
 I liked that it didn't have the old stand by of potatoes in it, and what a great way to use up leftover croutons.

Was not impressed with this recipe.  Followed recipe to the letter with exception of adding chopped onions.  Let it sit in fridge over night as recommended by another reviewer.  Even after whipping egg mixture with mixer until fluffy, dish turned out flat and unappetizing.  Served at Easter brunch and wasn't even half eaten while Baked Scrambled Eggs were devoured.  Will not fix again.

I couldn't find hash brown patties so I used a bag of hash browns. I don't like to change anyone's recipe and then comment about the changes but this small change shouldn't have affected much anyways we all enjoyed this recipe.

Use a little more than half the butter and hash browns instead of croutons if you don't want the bottom to be so creamy.  Whole family loves it!

My family and I loved this.  I made it exactly as written in the recipe and it was great. Next time I may try preparing it the night before- another reviewer said they did and that it tasted even better!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will definitely be making this again.

Very good... I didn't have bacon or croutons so I improvised...  :-)  I used dry stuffing mix for the croutons and sausage/ham slices for the bacon.  It turned out really good!  Fun to try something different in the morning.

Will definitely make again!!!

I used 8 eggs and 2 cups of milk. I also used some red and some orange bell pepper which I sauteed with a whole small onion before adding to my egg mixture. I let this sit in the fridge overnight. I forgot to add the mustard. Simply delicious. Very savory.

I made for 20 men and they all liked it. It was a hit!
I Made it with ham (cubes) instead of bacon. I did add some bacon bits. Also added some roasted red peppers. Sauteed the green peppers and then fried the ham a little.

It was good. I increased the number of eggs to 9 as recommended by others. Can't imagine how flat it would be with 6 eggs. My wife liked it better than I because she likes peppers.

It would have been a lot better with no croutons or peppers.  It's a breakfast casserole, why not include breakfast items?

This was my first breakfast casserole. I needed something easy to thro in the oven Christmas morning. As one reviewer said the one she put in the fridge overnight had more flavor, that sold me. I had everything but the bell pepper and decided to go without. I used 6 slices of bread instead of croutons and seasoned those with salt, pepper and paprika. I ended up mistakingly putting the bacon on top of the bread and then the egg mixture with the cheese on top of that. I looked like a regular egg casserole when finished, but with a surprise of bacon on the bottom. It was a hit as we are all adults with no kids, we just had what we wanted as we all got up. I will definitely make this again!

First time making. This was absolutely delicious! The only one thing I did different was cut down on the amount of bacon used. Instead of 12 slices I used 8. Will definitely be making this again.

Important to use flavoured croutons. I made my own with Italian seasoning. Can use diced potatoes instead (nuke them for 1 min)
It's a versatile recipe. Can add any veg. I will always fry up 1onion and garlic clove and add other veg. (mushrooms, broccoli, red sweet pepper, tomato,...
Can use ham,bologna, sausage or bacon. 
I used 12 eggs, 2.5c milk and more cheese and let it sit over night before cooking so flavours mix and mix gets soaked through. Baked for 50 mins. 
Reheats well. I liked it more the next day.

My husband and I made this for breakfast so we reduced this by half. We added about 2 cups of hashbrowns to the mix on top of the croutons. We also added onion to the egg mixture along with some Tabasco. This was a great start to our long day. I want to try making this ahead of time so that it can just be popped it in the oven on a sleepy morning. .

Let me start by saying that I don't agree with those of you that completely change a recipe, then rate it. However, subbing an ingredient with something close due to what's on hand is often a necessary evil. That being said, I had no croutons but did have some leftover herb stuffing to use up so...
This was very, very good. I did a layer of cubed hash browns (personal preference, needed to use, and just put them in the pan frozen and let them sit while I chopped the pepper, fried the bacon)  then  the stuffing. There was more than required, so I used it all.(I had reduced the recipe by 1/4 and probably had about 1/2  to 3/4 cup extra.) The cheese, but... The reduced recipe called for  4.5 eggs, used 5, but because of the potatoes and extra stuffing I had to add 4 more eggs and another 3/4 to 1 cup milk. Filled an 8x8 to very close to the top. Had to bake for 50 minutes, but man, was it worth it! The easy part was building it while the bacon cooked! My husband declared this a big win. Has requested it again, and last night, out of the blue, said his carnivore was coming out and I should add a layer of sausage between the bread and cheese! May do that but with Turkey sausage . Also, left out the butter on the stuffing layer, enough fat in the cheese and bacon! Love the leftovers! Nice to be able to get up and just have to reheat, on power 7, for a wonderful breakfast.Better flavor on day two!
Going into the rotation! Thank you for the wonderful recipe. Other recipes for breakfa

Made this for brunch and it was delicious!  I made it the night before and used 8 eggs and put the bacon throughout as another reviewer suggested.  I used a blend of cheeses as I often do for recipes.  I used Asiago arrabbiata croutons and they weren't soggy at all.  I cooked at 350 for 50 minutes and it was great.  Will definitely do again!

This one's a keeper!  I made a few minor changes based on what ingredients we had.  I used 1/2 bag of cubed hash brown potatoes instead of croutons, I used 8 eggs and 2 cups milk, and I had to cook it about 55 minutes.  Oh, and I also sauteed some chopped onion and chopped green bell pepper before putting it into the egg mixture.  Made this for a brunch party of 7 people and everyone LOVED it.  Including my two young picky kids, and including one guest who doesn't like eggs.  lol.  I'm going to make this again on Thanksgiving morning and Christmas morning, making it the day before so all I have to do in the morning is pop it in the oven.

While I appreciated the ease of prep, the texture was a miss for me.  I didn't like the texture of the croutons.  The flavors worked well (I subbed sausage for my protein), but the texture was just a bit off-putting for me. . THANKS for the recipe!

Made this for Easter Brunch this morning and it was delicious!!! I took the advice of other reviews and put it together last night then baked it this morning. I used 10 oz of  seasoned Texas toast croutons,  a full lb of bacon, and added 8 oz of chopped fresh mushrooms to the crumbled bacon. Also substituted half and half for the milk. Everyone raved about it and I will definitely be making this again!

This was delicous!  Even my very picky 11 year old son loved it.  I actually halved this recipe and used an 8x8 pan and the same cooking time.  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this for our small group from church who had all agreed they wanted 'breakfast for dinner.
It did not turn out well. I think only DH ate his full slice.
I'm giving it 3 stars because I'm not sure if it was my mistake or not.
I followed the recipe pretty faithfully except that I doubled the recipe because of what others said about it not filling the pan and I stored it overnight in a covered bowl because I was afraid the croutons would be soggy. That might have been a mistake because the bottom was pretty hard.
 It was very pretty just not very flavorful, even though I adjusted the seasoning's. 
I am going to try this recipe again for just the two of us because I really want this recipe to work!

This dish is so delicious and easy to make. I'm teaching my son to cook. He has made it with me and by himself, even substituting different breakfast meats and veggies. It's great for popping in the microwave for a quick breakfast before running out the door.

I make this over and over again because I it just keeps getting better each time!  I found that sautéing the veggies before putting them in the casserole makes the texture much better.  The veggies weren't quite soft enough when I didn't precook them.  I used some sausage and just added onion, red and green bell pepper to the sausage towards the end of cooking.  I also added bacon and used more croutons because I love the flavor that they add.  I also used 9 eggs and 2.25 cups milk and it turned out perfectly.  I always precook the meet and veggies so it is super quick to whip up in the morning!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty & easy. I used 3 cups unseasoned bread dressing cubes left from Thanksgiving. Also, had no pepper, but cut up broccoli florets & grape tomatoes from a Super Bowl veg tray. Worked just fine. No soggy bottom & no oily taste. Kudos to the creator of this recipe! Ate it two days; both good.

This was pretty delicious. I didn't have croutons, so I just toasted some bread and cubed it up, that worked just fine. I also chopped the bacon first, then fried it with onions and garlic for more flavor. The one thing I did find with this recipe, it's very rich. Delicious, but rich. In order to balance that cheesy, bacony richness, I diced up some fresh, cold tomatoes and served them on top of the casserole. All in all, a great dish. Thank you for posting it!

We didn't like this :( I was really excited to try it. Stuck to the recipe exactly. The crouton base was... weird. Had a lot leftover and couldn't bring ourselves to eat it. Disappointing.

Took this to Christmas brunch at my sister's in 2015.  It  was pretty good.  I ended up using 8 eggs and truly could have used 2 more.  I think it was to "bready" on the bottom.  I use the garlic cheese croutons. The top part was good though and I think with more eggs to make it feel like an omlette, it would have been great!  Love that this one has bacon rather than most of the breakfast casseroles have sausage

Delicious breakfast casserole!  I modified the directions by adding three eggs and a little more milk, half of a diced onion  and little more bacon and used a 9x13 dish.  I mixed most of the bacon into the casserole and crumbled the rest on top before refrigerating overnight.  This will be our new go-to breakfast casserole for Christmas morning.

Very nice breakfast casserole.  Have made it as it is and also substituting vegan bacon and almond milk in the recipe.  Both ways were good.  Would recommend for breakfast casserole fans.

It had great taste, however with cheddar cheese and the bacon together it was intensively salty. I suggest to cut the cheddar cheese out and use like orange american or something not as salty.  Next time I try this again i'll be aware as well to do so. Thanks!

Excellent brunch recipe.  After reading reviews I used 8 eggs and two cups milk.  I used cheesy garlic croutons.  I didn't have a bell pepper and instead added some onion, chopped up cherry tomatoes and fresh spinach.  It was delicious!  I mixed it up the night before and had to bake it an extra 30 minutes.  Everyone loved it!

I took this to a brunch this morning and it was a favorite dish on the table!  To sum up the changes I learned from other reviews:  I prepared the casserole last night and baked in the oven this morning to let flavors blend.  I added 10 eggs and kept other ingredients the same.  I baked it for 50+ minutes.  And because I live overseas and do not have easy access to croutons, I improvised with broken saltine crackers, garlic powder, and mixed herbs.  I will definitely keep this one marked for future brunches, Christmas morning, and other opportunities!

This has become a requested favorite in our family. It is DELICIOUS and easy to prepare. I make a day ahead and let it sit overnight. Tastes great hot out of the oven, and even reheated!

We always enjoy this recipe. I use flavored croutons and real crumbled bacon bits. I always fix it the night before and I use a couple extra eggs and more milk. I add some garlic and sometimes saute mushrooms and onions as well. It's super easy and is always a hit.

One of my most successful dishes!   I used sea salt & cracked black pepper flavored croutons, added some onions, and substituted turkey sausage for the bacon to make it more filling.   I took the advice of people to said to let it soak for a while before baking.   Also, I accidentally used Colman's mustard powder in place of the 'prepared mustard' called for in the egg mixture.   It seemed well received regardless, so I may continue to make it that way.   I made this the day after I slaved over six homemade quiches for a big party.   I was told this recipe was much tastier.   Maybe next time I have a fancy brunch party to do, I will make this in little ramekins.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious! I made and crumpled the bacon and the egg mixture the night before and put them in the fridge. I set out my pan, butter, and croutons as well, so in the morning I just had to assemble it and didn't have to get up extra early! I also added diced tomatoes (and also an extra egg) and it turned out great!

Instead of croutons, I use home fries! You can also add meat and veggies to add more flavor.

I loved this recipe. It was great that it was done in about hour. I just used what I had in the fridge. I substituted shaved lunchmeat ham for the bacon (I browned it a little in before I mixed in, and then it crisped up during the baking). I was out of milk but had some cream so I used that. I didn't need the butter after that.  it was delicious, and custard-like.

I have made this several times, I usually use 1/2 green pepper, 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 small re onion. I chop them up and saute them in a little of the bacon drippings. Because I let it sit overnight before cooking I add an additional 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk, I never add salt because the bacon and seasoned croutons are salty enough. The results are superb. I started doubling the recipe because family loves to take home leftovers. I make a french toast casserole, fruit salad, coffee crumb cake, fresh bagels, coffee and mimosas for an excellent holiday brunch. Since it is all prepared the night before I just put it in the oven 1/2 hour before the crowds show up. They are always so impressed....

Basically omelette and toast flavor in casserole form.  Easy to whip up with little effort.  I followed the recipe with just a few minor adjustments.  I used about 4 cups of seasoned croutons to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan.  Fried 1 lb of bacon until crisp and put over the croutons and cheese.  I sauteed the peppers and 1/4 cup minced onion in leftover bacon drippings before sprinkling them over the bacon.  I also added 3 extra eggs, and the liquid amount was just right.  Baked for 50 minutes at 350 degrees.

Very good- I added fresh mushrooms and onions along with the green pepper, I also used garlic butter croutons. I crushed the crutons in hopes to avoid all the "soggy" reviews..... Didn't come out soggy at all! Will make again. Thank you

My family could not get enough of this dish!  I made my own adjustments as far as amount of eggs and milk but it was so delicious.  The croutons made a huge difference and soaking this for a period of time before cooking is very important to this dish.

This was absolutely delicious.  Having read many of the reviews prior to making, I made some minor alterations.  I added 10 eggs instead of 6 and used an even 2 cups of milk instead of 1 and 3/4.  I used a red pepper and for additional flavor, I added a couple large shallots minced (figured onions would overpower it).  I used a combination of garlic & cheese croutons and Italian seasoned croutons.  I like the idea of sautéing mushrooms but was shooting for easy so didn't go that route (didn't sauté the shallots either).  Definitely delicious!

This was a great recipe! I made it for 6 adults who eat a hearty breakfast so I used 12 eggs, added chives, dill weed and 1lb of maple sausage...I used only 1 cup milk and either Italian seasoned or cheesy garlic croutons (I've mad it twice now it was such a hit) and then I baked it for 50minutes.  One of the times that I made it I used ground chili pepper and spiced it up some but it's good without. A great recipe to make into your own and tastes awesome!!  Oh yah.... I also used about 4 cups of cheese and everyone commented how yummy and cheesy it was...with more egg you want more of your other ingredients! This is a win for sure!

I used some of the comments and riffed off this as follows and crowd loved it: used egg beaters, replaced milk with 2 blocks of low-fat cream, sautéed two medium white onions with the bacon and added them, added some spicy sausage (chorizo) and a healthy amount of sriracha. Gooey, cheeses, a hit of heat - nummy!

Awesome! Made this today for Thanksgiving breakfast.  For my preference and less dishes I switched out the bacon for diced ham.  I also added a medium onion, diced.

I have used this recipe for breakfast events at work.  Everytime I make it several co-workers ask for the recipe.  It is so easy because I can make it the night before and just cook it in the morning as I am getting dressed.  I put it in a casserole carrier that holds the heat and it is ready to go when I get to work.  --- Chris

I just pulled this out of the oven and it was awesome! I had to make my own croutons, with evoo,Italian spices and garlic salt. Then I threw in a healthy tablespoon of crushed red peppers. Because I used an oval glass pan, the cooking time was increased to 1hr 45 min. Awesomeness!

Cooked it a bit longer than recipe called for.  I wanted to be sure it was done in the middle.  Everyone loved it!  note: only needed to buy one bag of croutons for this recipe and still had some left over.

The only thing I'm adding to this is 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion.  I'm using ground mustard instead of prepared, cubed day-old french bread instead of croutons and evaporated milk instead of whole, though, probably because I'm from New Orleans.  Oh, and yard eggs instead of store bought, because we have chickens.

i loved it i put onion in it also. the onion was marinated over night in barbeque sauces. i also put some chicken in it. we got the chicken from walmart already baked and it was awesome! i made it again without the onion and chicken. wasnt the same. make sure that you get the fat off of the bacon if there is any. we also topped it with green onion and salsa or taco sauce. :)

The bacon casserole had LOTS of flavor.  The sausage casserole was good as well but lesser punch of flavor.

I tried this recipe Christmas morning for something easy to pop into the oven while opening gifts. Imade it the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I used Jimmy Dean maple sausage in place of bacon and made my own croutons from french bread and it came out fabulous!!!! Definitely will make again!

Very good.  I used seasoned bread cubes and it was too salty.  However, sour cream and salsa made this wonderful.  A keeper, for sure thanks!

A bit of trouble to make for an ordinary breakfast but definitely worth it!  I think adding some salsa when serving makes it not so dry.  I'm going to make it again!

This is so yummy!!! I cut the green peppers and used seasoned crutons and it had plenty of flavor. My hubby is picky and he loved it. This will be added to our "keep" file.

This was delicious.  It made the perfect weekend breakfast.  I have made several variations as others have.  I am from the South, so we eat livermush.  I tried it with the livermush this morning, and it was great.  I added it toward the end of the cooking process, to prevent drying out.  Great recipe...thanks for the post.

This is so good and very easy!  Instead of cooking the bacon, I use the real bacon bits and put lots on the casserole, it saves time and still tastes great.  I do put a bit more cheese on than necessary too.  Wonderful taste!

I work nights, so I love meals that can be made ahead, and all my husband as to do is bake, or heat, or add something here and there. I made this for him in the am and and when it was suppertime, he popped it in the oven for him and the girls. They loved it. I did add onion and tomato and it was yummy! Thank you

I give it a 3 but my family gave it a 4.  I made this last night and just popped it in the oven this morning.  Cooking time was about 10 mins off (longer).  I think it wasn't "eggy" enough for me.  My son suggested that I try it with sausage the next time.

So easy and sooo good. I halved this recipe. Didn't have croutons so I used plain bread cubes (the stuffing mix kind) I had leftover. Used 2 cups of the cubes and seasoned them with Italian seasoning with a touch of garlic powder. Threw in an extra egg and some portuguese sausage I had leftover. There's so many possible add on's for this.

Very good & the eggs weren't too heavy like some recipes.  Saved a bit of fat & used low fat cheese & skim milk.  Next time, I'll probably omit the margarine as well, it didn't seem necessary.  Much tastier recipe than I thought, but I did use garlic croutons & added some tabasco.

My whole family liked this.  When we get bagged salad we don't always use the croutons that come with them so I had 7 packages of croutons from the salad.  Two packages of the croutons was just under 1 cup, I used all 7 packages that I had and it was enough.  I also used some cheese I had in the fridge and wanted to use up, and a whole package of bacon.  Like another reviewer said, "You can't have too much bacon."

This was pretty good but the croutons were throwing me off a little.  I have a similar recipe that uses potato cakes on the bottom (no butter sprinkled over top) and ham in place of the bacon.  I also add a little chopped jalapenos occasionally to give it a little kick.

This wasn't bad, but I didn't like it as much as some other breakfast casseroles.  It was different though, and chunky, if you like that.  I put in both red and green peppers and also some onion.
