My family loved this.  I added an extra cup of strawberries out of the garden, sugar was just right.  Made it vegan easily with vegan butter.

I had a one pound package of strawberries that I needed to use so decided to try this recipe.  Sliced all the strawberries (approx 3 cups).  Chopped up 6 cups of rhubarb, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups since I had so many more strawberries.  The rest of the recipe remained the same.  PERFECT!  This was delicious!  Served with vanilla ice cream.  Would definitely make again.

My husband loves strawberry rhubarb pie, requests one every year. This time I didn't have time to make a pie crust so decided to try a cobbler. He LOVED it. It was a hit. I cut recipe in half and added 1 more cup strawberries (frozen and fresh mixed) It was awesome. Thanks for this recipe!

Very good. My husband and I love this dessert. I sometimes reduce the rhubarb and add strawberries. I also have a problem with flour not being enough to thicken the berries, so I use Tapioca.

It was tasty, even people who said they didn't like rhubarb liked it. I was disappointed the cobbler part was so skimpy, I'll probably double it next time.

Use any fruit, the strawberries were wonderful (we use chandlers this time of year) but a mixed fruit of peaches, strawberries, cherries and blue or blackberries is better.
 I used Truvia for the brown sugar (same amount 1/4 the sugar) and Udi's granola (1/2 the carbs and sugars) and this can be healthy for everyone in the family.

I will definitely make this again! I love the combination of rhubarb and strawberries.  I did make some changes though after reading others reviews.  I doubled the topping and as a result, the fruit was completely covered.  I added chopped walnuts to give it a little more crunch. Because I only had 3 cups of rhubarb, I added 4 cups of strawberries. I added 3 T of flour to make the fruit mixture a little thicker also.   I also decreased the white sugar to 3/4 cup as I do not like super sweet desserts.  This is a recipe that you can play with and not go wrong. I think if you use 7-8 cups of any combination of fruit it will turn out fine.  Keep in mind that rhubarb has a lot more water content.  This is a keeper!

Cut the sugar by half and still found it pretty sweet but added some vanilla ice cream and that rounded out the flavour nicely!

I did two cups of strawberries instead of one. I increased all the toppings by 25%. It was excellent. Looked just like the featured photo. We ate it warm out of the oven. Perfect blend of tart and sweet.

I made this for hubby and he loves it.  I added, instead of strawberries, blueberries, 6ozs., red raspberries,  6ozs., black raspberries,  6ozs., and just 6 C. of rhubarb. I cut the sugar to 1 1/2C. I also doubled the topping because we love topping.  It was delicious.

I used more strawberry then it called for.  But it came out well. Very runny. It was sour when I ate it hot. Yet sweet! Had some more today and it thickened up some.  Seemed to taste better  today.  

I will add less white sugar next time and maybe a little more flour.

I also heated the berries and rhubarb with vanilla.  I did not have any cinnamon to put in it.

Thought this was a nice and easy crisp. I had a bunch of firm plums picked so cooked them up with a little brown sugar/cornstarch/flour/water and then added this topping after about 15 minutes in the oven. I'm not sure if it would be too

I rated it as a 4 only because the name implies that this is a "cobbler" and it is not.  It is a "crisp" and the name should be changed.  I printed the recipe and my wife made it but I was disappointed because I like cobblers much more than crisps.

Great flavor--especially the topping--but it was like soup. WAY too liquidy. Definitely needs more thickener.

I used 4 cups rhubarb and 2 cups strawberries...STILL  I used the same amount of topping as for the 8 cups in recipe... except I cut some sugar back - PERFECT ! Could nto get enough of it... I would say it was kind of a hybrid between cobbler and crisp. Highly recommend!

Yes I did make a change.  Next time I will add more strawberries.  I double  the topping.  It is a keeper.  Very good.

I had not had a rhubarb/strawberry dessert for a long time and finally decided to try it last night when we had some friends over. It turned out great topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Like some of the other commenters mentioned, I added more strawberries and reduced the sugar. My proportions were 6 cups rhubarb, 3 cups strawberries, and 1 1/2 cups sugar. It was a hit and I'll make it again!

I followed recipe except for adding just over an extra cup of strawberries and only 1 1/4 white sugar. Next time I'll put less sugar as I found it a tad sweet and will do the topping 1.5 times as it was a little short

Used 7-8 C fresh rhubarb and 2 cups whole frozen strawberries because that was what I could get in strawberries at the time.  Just thawed them slightly in the microwave so they could be quartered or sliced.  Also sprinkled the fruit & sugar combo with some fresh ground nutmeg prior to topping & baking.  Very good!

The only adjustment I made to this recipe is that I halved it (rhubarb is currently not in season and 8 cups of it would have been pretty expensive) and I did add the optional strawberries. I gave my boyfriend (who doesn't care much for sweets) a small piece and he loved it, but said it would be better with ice cream on the side. I, on the other hand, found it a bit too sweet. Next time, I'll go easier on the sugar and increase the topping by half. Still very enjoyable, though. Thank you for the recipe!

Perfect amount of sweetness and tartness.  I did 2 cups strawberries.  Awesome served warm with vanilla ice cream.
