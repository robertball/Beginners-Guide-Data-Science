This is a great recipe and so easy.  I took other reviewers' advice and cut sugar down to 1 cup, mixing it half brown sugar and half white sugar.   Added some red pepper flakes.  Other than that, exactly as written.   I turned the drumsticks every 15 minutes because they were not fully covered.  Definitely a keeper.

I have never boiled chicken before. This recipe has changed that idea for me. The flavor was through out the entire chicken drumstick. They sauce was very sticky, but oh so yummy. I would maybe knock down the sugar some. I wouldn't change anything else. Served with rice and had more sauce leftover for maybe some fried rice concept.

Followed directions as stated and the chicken was delicious. Had to keep turning chicken on its sides because the sauce did not cover them 100%. Everyone loved it!

I agree with Chef Mo.  It's very sweet.  A little overwhelming on just rice. For anyone that is wondering, 1.5 pounds of drumettes is about 6 pieces. There is plenty of sauce left over. Next time I'm serving with steamed , stir fry type veggies.

Fall off the bone great!  I went with the suggestions and used just 1 cup of sugar (1/2 white & 1/2 brown) and added some red pepper flakes. Turned legs every 15 mins.   I steamed some broccoli and threw it in the pot in the last 5 minutes and served over rice.  Hubby loved it :-)

I made this tonight to rave reviews. I took the advice of others on here and cut the sugar down and did half white, half brown sugar. It's very delicious and the sauce is great drizzled over everything (white rice and broccoli were my sides). Of course it's a high sugar high salt content food so I wouldn't make it all the time and now I'm guzzling water. Easy to make also which is a plus.

A hit with the whole family! So easy and delicious. I would have to agree that it is on the sweet side. I'll be reducing the amount of sugar when I make it next time, much to my 5 year old's dismay. She said it was amazing!

Will make again! Great starter recipe, I did cut back the sugar and swapped some white sugar for brown. I also added crushed red pepper to help cut the sweet. Thanks for the recipe!
