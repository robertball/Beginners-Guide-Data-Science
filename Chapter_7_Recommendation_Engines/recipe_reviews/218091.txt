I am giving this 5 stars for ease alone....I didn't even cook the lasagna noodle.  One layer sauce on the bottom of the pan - noodles then a layer of sauce.  I assembled in the morning using homemade leftover sauce and put in the refrigerator.  I took it out and popped it in the oven - for about 45 minutes - took the foil off and cooked an additional 10.  Perfect and oh so easy.  UPDATE - I made this with Johnsonville Italian sausage and it was great.

I never know how many stars to leave when I make changes. Just for personal preference, I'd give it 4 stars because I don't care for the cottage cheese/egg layer, and leave that out. Usually when I make my own lasagna I don't precook my noodles, and we prefer shredded chicken over ground beef. Other than that, this is pretty close to how I make mine! I probably use more cheese, and sometimes cheddar in addition to the mozzarella. For variety, if we have veggies that need to be used I might add sliced zucchini and/or spinach as well. But this recipe is a good, solid, simple lasagna, and you should try it!

The BEST lasagna! My husband prefers this even over resertaunt lasagna! Definitly adding to my personal receipe box.

Side note: Since we didn't want a lot of leftovers I doubled the receipe then devided into 3 aluminum containers. 2 I then placed in the freezer for another night. 1 containers made a perfect 4 serving dinner! Now I don't have to 2 to other nights this month and my husband has something available if I'm not arround!

I have now made this recipe several times and everyone loves it! I made some changes by using regular noodles and ground beef. The only recommendation that I would give is I have a 9x13 pan and I like to double the amount of meat and cheese mixture I make so that it is a thicker lasagna.

Although this was very good, I think it needed more sauce. I found it to be a little dry, but flavors are great and hubby loved it. Next time I'll add more sauce and add mozzerella in the layers instead of all on top. Also, the cooking time was longer than stated in the recipe.

I didn't care for it. Didn't like the basil and thought it needed more cheese. Husband loves it though, so does son. 2 against 1.

First time ever making lasagna, and it was amazing! My husband isn't even a huge fan of lasagna and he loved it! Also, it was incredibly easy!! We didn't make any changes to the recipe except we added a layer of sliced tomatoes under the mozz. cheese. Love this! And, we will be making many more times!!

Very basic, and very nice.  I didn't have cottage cheese so I subbed a little bit of plain greek yogurt instead.  I didn't make as much of the cheese mixture as a result; I didn't want it to be too out of the ordinary.  I used homemade lasagna noodles; since this is our first attempt at pasta, and they were thick, I added a cup of water and baked for twice as long.  This turned out very well.  Very delicious, basic lasagna.  Satisfied hubs' craving for it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and yummy! I followed the recipe except I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage and added mushrooms, olives and onions to the tomato sauce. Also I didn't want too much left overs so I put it in 2 8-8 glass pans to have one next week and they were perfect serving size for my family of 4.

I used 2lbs of ground beef & 1lb of italian sausage and 2 whole jars of sauce. The 9x13 was nice and full and baked for 1 hour. 1 1/2 lb of meat wouldnt do much feeding the guys. But yes, this is my future lasagna recipe.

Next time in the future, i'll add the sauce while cooking the beef to not only add flavor, but, to make it easier when preparing to layer and bake in the oven. Also using tomato paste to make the beef have more flavor.

Delicious recipe.  I did  make a  few changes to suit my family's needs. I used 2 pounds of ground turkey, 9 lasagna noodles, 16 ounces of ricotta cheese along with Fiesta  blend cheesed  and Mexican blend cheese. Followed the recipe to the tee other than that. Excellent taste and it held together very  well.

I made this lasagna a few times using this recipe. It was very delicious. The only thing I would do different is use more cottage cheese. That made the recipe complete.

I used Ricotta Cheese and Marinara Sauce and it came out amazing.  I will add more meat and use more Mozzarella and sauce next time.  Overall, very easy and tasty.

This was my first time making lasagna. What an easy and great recipe!! My son never likes anything and he loved this. Just to make it a little easier I added the meat in with the cheese mixture and I used ricotta (half slim) cheese instead of cottage.

This recipe was very easy to make. I was out of oregano, so I used Italian seasoning instead. Also, I used plain tomato sauce and added basil. My husband usually doesn't like lasagna, but thought this was very tasty.

Very easy to make and everyone loved it!  Lasagna can be an intimidating meal to make.  But this recipe was so easy! Used no-boil noodles, and started with a layer of sauce on the bottom first before adding the first layer of noodles.  Also added some milk to the recipe to increase liquid ratio for the noodles. Turned out great and children have requested this recipe be added to our regular rotation!  So thank you!

Okay, I give this 4 stars because I try it their way, and I had a problem with cottage cheese being used.  So I go back to my tried and true.  First of all, if you use the flat "No need to boil" lasagna noodles it will taste even more Italian homemade.  Second, don't use cottage cheese because if people don't like cottage cheese right out of the container because of texture they will have the same issues eating lasagna with it.  Instead, if you must have that authentic cheese filling because I prefer mine without it, use the RICOTTA cheese instead and stir in lots of shredded parmesan cheese and about 1 tablespoon oregano and 1 egg (egg not necessary if you use lots of parmesan as the binder). 
Another tip is if no one has an aversion to pork in the family take a 1lb package of breakfast sausage and mix in about 2 tbs of Italian seasoning, fry, and drain and add it in along with the ground beef.
Also, make a small pot of sauce or jars of marinara sauce you heat up on the stove.  So those who like extra sauce can put it on the plate first and put the slice of lasagna on top of the extra sauce.  This way you don't have to fret over if it's too dry or not.  If they think it's dry add extra sauce and get over it.

Simple, came out great. Easy to follow.

Minor Tweaks on mine : 2 lbs of meat, 2 jars of sauce, Ricotta cheese. Mix the (browned) beef with sauce to make it easier to spread in the pan. Throw cheese in the middle layer for fullness

Only 4 stars because I had to add more ground beef and sauce.  On hind sight I would have saved just enough sauce for the bottom and top layers and mixed the rest with the ground beef.  That said, I couldn’t hear any complaints over the smacking at the dinner table.

This was the first time I successfully made homemade lasagna and it turned out amazing!

I tried two times before without a recipe because the person whose lasagna I liked as a kid told me she never used written directions and just dumped the basic ingredients of cheese, noodles, meat and sauce in layers and baked it.

My attempts at doing it her way were... disasters.

This recipe turned out very well, although I goofed up and added a final layer of noodles on top just under the cheese (I also sprinkled some mozzarella within the layers as well).

Would highly recommend!

I absolutely love this recipe, although I don’t follow it 100%. Here are some of the changes I make: I usually cook 2-3 lbs ground beef because we like our lasagna meaty over here! I use a decent amount of  seasoning (seasoned salt, pepper, oregano, Italian seasoning) and another tsp or 2 minced garlic when cooking the meat, and I use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Since I make it with more meat, I use 32 oz of ricotta cheese and 4 eggs instead of two.One must? Thoroughly season your ricotta/cottage cheese mixture!! I season mine with Italian seasoning; seasoning salt, pepper, garlic salt and pepper, and oregano. Since I use more meat, I also usually have to cook it a little bit longer. I normally cook it 45 minutes or more before I remove the foil for the last 20 minutes or so to brown the cheese. One last little tip I have is to stick four toothpicks in it so your foil doesn’t take away all your cheese!

I loved this recipe!!! Super simple I used oven ready noodles so I didn’t even cook them just added baking time until the noodles softened and I also substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese! So easy and delish! I would only add maybe a bit more cheese throughout but overall super tasty for the amount of effort I put into it!

Great simple recipe.  I made a few modifications, fresh lasagna pasta, ricotta cheese in addition to cottage and more sauce to make it a bit bigger.  The cook time in oven seems to be quite understated.  Took about 60-70 min in the oven.

this turned out phenominal. Though it really appeared during prep that the layer fillings (which were difficult to spread throughout) were going to make the dish appear thin and unfilled, the cooking process evened it all out. I made some minor modifications to it, based on personal taste, but the meal turned out beautifully.

I had some fresh mushrooms I needed to use, so I sauteed them, and added them to the first layer,  atop the layer of lasagna noodles and a can of plain tomato based pasta sauce. Next level was ground beef and pork sauteed with onion/garlic and covered with a jar of pasta sauce with meat in it, and the layer of pasta again. Next was the ricotta cheese layer and noodles. Last layer was spicy chicken Italian sausage covered with a jar of  spicy sausage sauce.  I discovered too late that I had only a bit of mozzarella cheese, so I mixed it with my plentiful mild cheddar cheese and parmesan, and covered the entire casserole with it before baking under foil for the hour. I made my 16" x 12" x 3" roaster full for leftovers guaranteed. This was way easier than I expected!

You need more sauce and more meat for this recipie.  I doubled the meat (and could have used a little more).  I used 2 full jars of sauce and a 320 bag of shredded cheese for top.  I never altered the recipie ingredients other than using white needles instead of while wheat and I didn’t have fresh parmesan so I used the grated 100% parmesan.  Recipie is awesome, a keeper for sure.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I followed the recipe except I only had one jar of pasta sauce 16 oz  and added one 14 oz can tomato sauce to it, worked out perfectly fine. I didn't use whole wheat lasagna noodles either, just regular ones. Looking forward to making it again--hopefully very soon.

My family loved it. The cottage cheese made it a bit less heavy in the cheese department, which worked for those who like it more balanced. Instead of 1 lb. of ground beef, I used 3/4 lb of ground beef and 1/4 lb of sweet Italian sausage. They liked this zesty flavor. Storing the rest of it in individual pieces in freezer for microwaving later.

Base on other reviews doubled the recipe and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and split into 3 8x8 pans so we could freeze 2. It was really good.

This recipe needs twice the amount of tomato sauce listed, but otherwise it turned out very well. I made a few tweaks to the cottage cheese/egg/parm layer. I used low fat cottage cheese instead of full fat. I also chopped about 1 cup fresh spinach and added 1/2 tbsp dried basil to this layer. Next time I will probably use low fat ricotta instead.

Used this  Recipe once before. But like the first time to me and my family it was still a little dry double put the sauce and it came out perfect. And added a little sweet / spicy Italian sausage. Will definitely make this more often

This was so delicious! I'm only will give it 4/5 stars because I made 2 changes. I had ricotta on hand so I used that instead of the cottage cheese. And I had ready to bake noodles instead of the whole wheat boiling required kind.
I will make this again! Absolutely!

I made this lasagna but I changed a few ingredients. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, regular noodles instead of whole wheat (also oven-ready so no need to boil), and I used Italian sausage out of the casing with ground beef. It was about 3 pounds of meat all in all. One pound of meat is not enough for a 9x13 pan of lasagna. It was very delicious the only thing I would change about how I made it was the sauce... I did not put enough sauce in there but it was still tasty. I highly recommend.

The only I made was using Italian venison sausage. So good and seasoned just right. It is hunting season and sometimes I just need to change up recipes to use the meat.

Dinner was lovely. Used zest and spices sauce instead to give it a different kick. Added basil to the sauce to stay on track with the recipe. Also added olive oil to the ground beef when cooking.

I gave it a 5 star for simplicity in steps and process. Actually easier than I thought. The only change I made was I added creamy basil Alfredo aged Parmesan cheese to the cottage cheese  and egg mix because I had gotten 8oz jar, instead of 16 oz, so I added that to sort of "stretch" the cottage cheese. But it taste very good.

Family loved it, will definitely make again! I used Mexican queso fresco instead of cottage or ricotta cheese (didn't have either on hand) which gave the dish some counterbalance to all that melted mozzarella cheese. Although, I had doubled the cheese amounts than what the recipe called for, it was still not enough for layering. I ended up (generously) layering in mozzarella cheese. I used an organic, diced tomato and basil sauce which gave the final dish a rustic finish, but the recipe definitely needs more sauce. Pair it with a good wine and enjoy.

I love the simplicity of this lasagna sauce. It's easy enough to amp it up by changing out the cottage cheese for ricotta and adding in more spices. (But then it would be a different recipe.) This one is a perfect lasagna for children who don't like a lot of spicy foods.

Yes, very easy.  I like the cottage cheese; creamier. I also put in the middle a layer of leftover spinach/artichoke dip I'd made the night before. Since my son likes cheese I mixed in to the cottage chees some Parmesan/Romano and sprinkled some on top before adding shredded mozzarella about 30 minutes into the baking. Lastly after cooling for 10 min. I sprinkled on some fresh parsley. Yum!

Used all organic ingredients and changed the cottage cheese to ricotta.  It turned out wonderful.  Would definitely make it again, and was so easy.

This is an insanely good Lasagna that requires so little work to make compared to other Recipes. As someone who doesn't like cottage cheese, I cannot imagine having Lasagna without it now.

However, I would recommend increasing the cheese mixture by about 50% depending on the side of your pan. My pan ended up being a little large and ended up with poor overall coverage with the cottage cheese mixture.

This was a good basic recipe that I will make again.  I did not use wheat noodles.  This is a recipe that could be changed, perhaps by adding some vegetables, or using ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  However, the 5 stars are for being a tasty lasagna that we all liked alot.

I would make this recipe again, though I would either double or triple every ingredient except for the noodles. There wasn't enough cheese or meat for the amount of noodles in the dish, so just double or triple those ingredients.

This is definitely a good, dependable lasagna recipe! I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese (just not a cottage cheese fan), and I mixed the sauce with the ground beef mixture and spread it like that. Even though I used the same amount of sauce as the recipe, it wasn't saucy enough to me. I think next time I make this, I would use more sauce so that I can mix some of it with the meat and also do the sauce-only layers.  But all in all, a very good recipe!

So i gave 4 stars because it was delicious but definately needed more meat. Next time i would use atleast 1 1/2 lb ground beef maybe even 2lbs. I also added steak seaoning to my beef which i use in alot of my recipes that call for ground beef. Recipe was super easy to make and the family loved it!

I made a few change to this recipe. I made homemade spaghetti meat sauce and added parsley and pepper to the cheese mixture. I also made a pan with just the cheese mixture and my spaghetti meat sauce. It turned out amazing. Great recipe.

FABULOUS!  Now my husband does NOT like cottage cheese so I substituted it for ricotta.  That and we have ground deer meat.  I made it exactly like they said...even the cooking time on the noodles!  Perfect!  This was my first time to ever make homemade lasagna and I was nervous but it was so easy!  Going to make this for now on...but with extra sauce!  ;-)

food turned out good but the recipe needs to give an idea of how much of each mixture to put on the layers to help anyone making lasagna for the first time.  and in directions needs to say how much of each item to put into the mixtures so we don't have to keep trying to find the measurement while keeping our place half way down the page.

Yes I did make a slight change.   I didn't use the entire container of Cottage Cheese.  I mixed it with a little Sour Cream.  I also mixed in a little Italian Sausage and I wound up with four thinner layers.  Delicious!  :-)

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was quick easy and simple and that is exactly what I was looking for being a first time lasagna maker and college student. I had half the ingredients anyway. However, sauce was scarce; I love sauce and it was just enough to finish it off. Next time I'm adding more or making mine from scratch, (my initial idea). The meat, maybe 2lbs instead of 1lb..? I really had to portion there and even still meat was also scarce. I seasoned it with my own seasonings and the flavor was delicious. I will be making it again, but I'm definitely adding to it, and I will encourage anyone else that so happens to come across this recipe!

This was an amazingly simple recipe. Made some adjustments that I think worked out very well. Firstly, I bought fresh made lasagna pasta so it didn't need any pre-cooking. Secondly, I subbed the cottage cheese for ricotta. Lastly I replaced the ground beef with a pound of spinach. It came out sooooo good and my daughter loved it! This will be in our repertoire for the foreseeable future. Loved how easy it was.

I think this recipe is a decent start, but I definitely ran out of cheese mixture and I only put a paper thin layer. The amount of noodles and sauce was about perfect though. May have been a bit too meaty on the sauce. The amount of meat made it tough to spread. Overall, easy and a good base. I'll add at least another half of a container of ricotta next time.

Very good, very easy recipe. The family loved it. This was my first time ever making lasagna. Now I feel compelled to try more complex lasagna recipes. :)

I am giving this 5 stars because it was simple to make and my whole family loved it. They went back for seconds and thirds. The only thing I changed was I did not pre cook my noodles which were reg noodles not wheat. I cooked for 45 mins covered and 10 mins uncovered. Very good it's a keeper.

Generally good recipe. I highly recommend ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I also prefer to finely chop some fresh basil and mix it in with the ricotta. For meat I use a combination of 90% lean ground beef along with some hot and/or sweet Italian sausage, depending on the preference of my diners.

I made this to share with a friend who was helping me with some household chores and it got rave reviews from both of us. The only change I made was to add some sweet Italian sausage to the ground beef mixture. Delicious!

While I did make modifications to the recipe, it remained true to the basics- layered, cooked lasagna noodle, sauce, meat, and cottage cheese.
Modifications:
- Combined sauce with meat 
- Added spinach to the sauce
- Only used nine noodles (Different pan dimensions)
- Mixed cottage cheese with mozzarella instead of parmesan 
- Used half lean turkey and half Italian sausage for the meat
-Used thyme in place of Oregano 

I'd make this again for sure. My family loved it and my mom said it was the best meal I've ever made. Everyone went back for seconds.

I loved this for my very first time makes lasagna.  For beginners this words out great. I added some spices to the meat I love, also I was told to make sure your noodles were pat dry before, add a spoon full of tomato paste into your sauce and a half of a spoon of sugar to cut the bitter taste of the paste. Add an egg to your cheese mix to make it thicker. I was very pleased with all of this. Loved it and will make it again.

It was decent and yummy - who can be mad at meat and cheese? VERY east to make. My first time making Lasagna. I can Beef Bourguignon and deglaze yer mama's  but I’ve never Lasagnad. It turned out a bit flat and visually meh. My son who won't eat anything actually went back for seconds. Next time I'll add vegetables to give it some nutritional value and know what to expect. Yum good with a salad.

This recipe was easy and a great big hit!! Have not made a lasagna in many years.
I used fresh ground turkey and sweet Italian sausage mixed together. Everyone loved the taste.

The tittle says it all "Classic and Simple...", considering this was my first time making Lasagna it was oh so simple and delicious. Prep and cook time was less than one hour. In conclusion my family was very pleased, full and happy. Thank you allrecipes.com
