I must admit that at first I had reservations about this recipe, but it's 'rib season', so I tried it. My son, who is a painfully picky eater, gobbled this down. He said it was 'boss'. I took it to a church function and it was a big hit. A different twist on an old favorite, nice change of pace. Yummy.

this recipe is so good!  i left out the horseradish, worcesterhire & garlic salt.  i used sweet baby rays bbq sauce.  it didnt need the extra spice.  also, i grilled them on the grill.  they were so tender and moist.  they were a big hit with everyone who tried them.  i've made them 3 times already and always get requests to make them from my picky daughter who loves them.

Update:  I've made these many times now. Love them.  A little tip:   I put the barbecue sauce in a small/med deep bowl and dunk the ribs in with tongs.   So much easier than brushing.

Incredible!  With the unforgiving weather this weekend, grilling wasn't an option and my tastebuds wanted ribs.  I think this recipe rendered some of the tastiest ribs I've ever made even though it's a boiling/oven method.  It's a no-brainer to make and a "keeper"!  Just may cut down on the amount of BBQ sauce the next time as there was too much.

YUM!  Followed the recommendations to use less barbecue sauce (I used one regular sized bottle, and that was plenty). That was the only change I made.  These ribs were the best I've ever made, grilled or in the oven.  So easy!  You can do other things while they are boiling on the stove and then toss them on the grill and in a few minutes they're done.  I am already sharing the recipe with friends!  Thanks!

AWESOME!  I used this on pork chops and it was great!  Boiled them in the apple juice, then marinated in the sauce for an hour or so... then put the chops on the grill... WOW great tasting and everyone loved them! Thanks!

Absolutely delish!! I simmered the ribs in the apple juice for about 2 hours until fork tender. I also used horseradish sauce which is a little less "hot" than regular horseradish. Put foil in the pan first-easy cleanup! We like to use Stubbs original BBQ sauce. Rave reviews from company. We make this lots and lots.  Oh yeah-sometimes I forget to get the apple juice or use frozen-still tastes great just simmering  in water.

These were liked by everyone who ate them. I used only 1/4 cup of horseradish, as some family members do not like spicy food and you could still certainly smell and taste the horseradish. A very easy dish to put together, you can boil the ribs ahead and cover in sauce and then refrigerate until about 45 minutes before you want to serve them and then bake. Thanks!

My family said "Awesome" and even I did my share of licking my fingers and eating an extra large portion.  My daughter suggested that I send this to her sister away at college.  So on parent's visiting day for freshman, these ribs will be going to Delaware.

I left out the garlic salt, worchestershire and horse radish  and they turned out great!  4 lbs is a rack of ribs, I cut them in quarters to fit in the stock pot and it took two large bottles of apple juice to cover them.  But we didn't need 3 cups of BBQ sauce.  The meat was incredibly tender, the sauce had the nice flavor of the apples as did the meat itself.  Great recipe, will use over and over again!

These ribs are fantastic!!  The weather wouldn't let me grill, but I had a cravin' for ribs.  This was a great alternative.  Simmering in apple juice really added a great flavor to the meat and they were fall off the bone tender.  I may try cranberry juice next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

These ribs were very good.  My husband and children ate them all up!  I just wanted to know when you simmered the ribs in the apple juice did you cover the pot or leave it uncovered?  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

My husband went on and on about the ribs. I was skeptical about the horseradish, but what I fool I am.  This is the best, new cooking trick I learned this year - by far. A lot of people suggested to cut the sauce recipe by half and I did that.  The ribs were not falling off of the bone, as others said about their ribs.  I however, used pork loin baby back ribs, thinking that the quality of the meat would be better. I am by no means done wih this recipe and would suggest it to everyone.

Tender meat and I liked the horseradish flavor, but a little to wet for my liking.  I would have preferred it if the meat were dryer and the sauce had thickened and carmelized more.

Delicious ribs. My family loved them. I will definitely cut down on the amount of bbq sauce as I had much left over. Served with collard greens ("kickin' collard greens" recipe) and baked beans. Great meal.

By far the best ribs I have ever had. I could not believe how soft and juicy they came out. Not to mention tasty. They really do fall off the bone.  Wow I am going to make this recipe again and again and again.  Excellent.

Very good and easy to make. If you're expecting it to have a discernable apple flavor, don't. It mostly takes on the taste of the bbq sauce. But the meat comes out nice and juicy.

We loved the flavor of these ribs.  The mean definitely fell off the bone; we boiled them for 2 hours and while trying to move them to baste and put them in the oven pans they were already trying to fall apart!  The flavor is wonderful; I'm not a huge fan of horseradish but that flavor was not overwhelming at all.  We used one full 24 oz bottle of bbq sauce.  If you want a tangier flavor, be sure not to use a honey bbq sauce.  We will definitely make these again!

Excellent!  I used apple cider instead of juice and we grilled the ribs instead of baking them.  They were moist and tasty, and not too spicy (as I had feared with the horseradish), and the family loved them!  I used 6 lb. of ribs, and there was so much sauce, I ended up saving half of it for another time.

Excellent recipe! I don't usually cook, but this recipe caught my attention so I decided to try it. My husband loved it and said he would never trade it in any other kind of bbq ribs out there.

Ribs were tender- but we didn't care for the aftertaste.  Perhaps the horseradish we have in the house is a little more potent than most.  I also simmered them in apple cider vs apple juice.

I followed the recipe exactly as printed.  When we were eating I asked my husband, "How do you like the ribs?" "Best I ever ate," he said with a full mouth.  I'd recommend cutting the amount of barbeque sauce in half.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and his friends and everyone loved it! Even the "health" conscience ppl who dont eat meat couldnt resist. One friend, who graduated from culinary school was impressed and told me "this is what ribs are suppose to look and taste like, falling off the bone".  So simple and so good!
