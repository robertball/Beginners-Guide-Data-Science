This is exactly the same recipe my mother passed down to me and I've been making for years.  It is the best sloppy joe recipe around.  Sometimes I'll add chopped celery and green chiles to change it around.  I've even added some beans if we are in the mood.  One thing we ALWAYS do before eating the sandwiches...cube up some Velveeta and bury about 5 chunks into the meat mixture before placing on the top bun...let them melt into ooey goodness before taking that first bite...YUMMY!!!!

I'm used to the old standby: manwich... 
I was looking for some good recipes for my picky 6 year old and came across this.. 
Holy  this is so much better than anything from a can.
I loved it and more importantly my "if its not Mac and cheese I don't want it!" 6 year old devoured it.

Way to go and thank you!

This is the best sloppy joe recipe I have ever tasted. True to it's description we're going on the third night of our sloppy joe marathon. We didn't have any vinegar so it was omitted and my son doesn't like onions so I used onion powder. I also added a little red cayenne pepper. I made them with ground beef the first night. They were so good I was eating it out of the pan. Night two the kids begged me to make them again. All I had was ground pork but I gave it a shot. They were fabulous. I'm glad I have more ground pork because they want them again tonight. I think we'll have a nice light chicken salad on Sunday haha.

Made this a lot. Sometimes I use onion powder instead of cut up onions and the kids really do go crazy about it!

My husband loved this he came home from the grocery with gr. Beef & gr turkey yesterday so I could make more! 
I use 1/2 beef & 1/2 turkey ground of course.  I added some chopped green pepper and don't laugh 1tsp. of pickle relish, he says that is the secret ingredient that sets it above the rest!!

My sons, 18 and 22 and big and tall, loved this recipe.  Yes, it is a little sweet and if that is a concern, simply reduce the amount of brown sugar.  I am making this again for dinner tonight!

Awesome! The kids gobbled it up, and I liked it too. Much better than the canned stuff. I will make it again and again, such a quick and simple dinner. The only thing I'll probably adjust is the cider vinegar, it was just a hair too strong for me, really, just a tad. So next time I'll try making it with just a little less cider vinegar.

This recipe as is, is very good and kid friendly! My one year old gobbles it up. My husband and I enjoy it as well. My favorite thing about this dish is that it is VERY easy to hide in vegetables. Carrots taste especially delicious in it.

These are excellent sloppy joes! I'm really surprised that there aren't more reviews for this. I made the other recipe on here, the one with  over 4,000 reviews, quite a few times. However, that recipe was just a bit too sweet, and it was just missing something. This recipe uses the same base ingredients, minus the garlic powder, but in different proportions. These modified proportions and the addition of apple cider vinegar make it perfect! The only thing I changed was the addition of some chopped green pepper. Obviously omit that if you or your kids don't like them.

We made this last night in an effort to cut down on processed items. My whole family loves. Instead of buns, we use multi-grain Scoops. It lightens the meal and adds crunch!

Absolutely delicious!! I added a little garlic powder to the meat while it was cooking (which I do when cooking any meat) but other than that I followed the recipe.  My family loved it!!

I made it exactly as written.  It was very good and all four of us enjoyed it.  Next time, I will probably use a little less vinegar.  This will go in our meal rotation; definitely better than making sloppy joes with a store-bought seasoning package.

I have made this a few times. first time I followed the recipe and it was a little to sweet. from then on instead of a cup of ketchup I used a cup of chopped tomatoes. and kept the rest the same. it's so much better. I have also been know to throw in finely chopped celery carrots and peppers. chopped them so small the kids dont even realise.

I tripled the recipe. I like sweet but it’s a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I would cut back on the brown sugar. Or make sure your ketchup doesn’t have a high sugar content.

It was THE best sloppy joe. I let it simmer quite a bit longer (over an hour) because the vinegar taste was just way to strong for us so next time I will ease up on that but my family said I have to make it for every event from now on. Everyone absolutely loved it.

My kids loved it! (Used 1 tbsp honey instead of the brown sugar). Seemed like a lot of onion to the ground beef, but as I used my chop wizard to dice the onion my kids didn’t notice.

When making a large quantity, 10 lbs ground beef, I substituted mirepoix for about a third of the diced onion.  Very good result.

Introduced Sloppy Joes to my daughter a few years back with this recipe, and she immediately declared it her favourite food. We’ve made it A LOT over here, and I followed the recipe exactly. She’s even made it herself once, and it was the first recipe she added to her favourite recipes book. Today I’m going to try it with lentils instead of beef; we’ll see how that goes over! It’s the sauce she loves, so I think it’ll be great. Thanks for this throwback recipe to my own childhood.

This is really good. I love it! I originally planned to make it for my dad since I am not a big ground beef eater. But of course I had to do a taste test to make sure it would be something he would like and to my surprise I enjoyed it myself that I kept some on the side for me. I even ended up making it again for just myself. It was a hit with my dad as well and this ground beef was something he wasn't originally a fan of but it was what my mom had on hand. It masked the original flavour of the ground beef. I did substitute the apple cider vinegar with white wine vinegar since I wasn't too sure on if he would like the taste of the apple cider vinegar. Still worked! My mom even told me to keep this recipe on hand for another day for my dad to have again. Thanks for the recipe. Not only kid pleasing!

These are great, I will never go back to the can stuff! Plus the ease of this makes it super easy to share with say, young college students. :-)

This recipe is delish as is.  My husband hated sloppy joes, but he didn't have a choice one night.  Now he asks for these.  Sometimes we don't want it too sweet so I cut the sihar or add more vinegar.  As long as you taste while you go, you can't go wrong!!

I made it for the first time for my spice averse partner. The vinegar/sugar ratio made the sloppy joes too tart for both of us. I will use 1 tsb of ACV next time. I  used leeks instead of onion due to dietary restrictions (Low FODMAP diet) and cooked them in the fat separately from the meat because leeks typically take 20 minutes to cook.. I  added 1 tbsp gluten free flour mix to meat and onion mix before adding the ketchup mixture. My mother always did this in her sloppy joe recipe. I really liked the texture of this recipe. I look forward to trying it again with ACV. Thank you for providing me with a good sloppy joe base I can tweak to please my partner.

It's delicious, but my kids aren't too into it. The flavor is a bit strong for them.

Greta recipe! My 2 yr old, 4 yr old and husband all loved it! Only thing I didn't follow exactly was I used onion powder instead of fresh onion.  Will definitely be making this again!

We loved it! I ran out of ketchup and had to do half ketchup and half BBQ sauce. The sauce was so rich and it was super easy to make! I will use this recipe again!

My daughter, who is a very picky eater, especially when it comes to anything with meat, really liked this recipe! I made it with ground turkey instead but kept everything else the same & it was great! I will make this again!

Very sweet and tangy at the same time.  It was very popular with my family!  If you want something a little less sweet, I would just adjust the sugar quantity down- this works well with cole slaw on top.
