I have made this bread 3 times this week.  the first time was a disaster - probably due to my ineptitude - but the second time was perfect.  Absolutely the best bread I have ever made.  Soft,  moist, beautiful crust and tasty.   Perfect for sandwiches even if they are not Cuban.  Using lard and using no mechanical devices except a stove takes you back, especially if your my age. I have some rising as we speak.
Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Followed the recipe with the note about using half regular flour, half bread flour. I really hoped this would be the one that would yield an authentic Cuban bread. Instead it came out more like a sourdough bread. Too dense, compared to Cuban bread. Although I was disappointed, the bread itself was still really good. Nice, crisp outside. Maybe next time I will try heating the baking sheets with the oven...hhhmmm.

This is pretty darn close to the bread from a Tampa Cuban bakery I used to frequent, just a few feet shorter and minus the palm leaf down the middle. Your home oven will not be wide enough for the typical 3.5-4 foot long loaves from the bakery. Not a bad thing you don’t have to fish leaf pieces out of your bread. The lard is a MUST. Made it with butter and it’s just not the same. My starter has been going for over 6 months now. Just feed it with equal portions flour and water after each use.

I don't know how "authentically" Cuban it is because I have nothing to compare it to.  Chef John said himself in the video that it would be as close as we could get to it.  I DO know I love this recipe & will keep it in my computer of favorite bread recipes.  I used the same big crock my grandma made bread in.  It was like having her there in the kitchen with me.  Thank you, Chef John, you're the best.  I love your nonchalant presentations.  Don't ever leave us.

I’m new to bread making. This bread was easy for me to make. It came out great. I made Cuban sandwiches with it. I made it again today. I think I like it better than the white bread I make.

This was my first attempt at making any type of bread, and it turned out great. I didn't flatten mine quite enough or pinch the seams closed so they weren't quite a pretty but from what I can gather, the texture, the super thin and flakey crust were there, and the taste was amazing.

Great find!  This is a really straight forward recipe. Assembling the starter was super quick and performed great. I followed the recipe as written although I used half bread flour and half all purpose.  I subbed in  Crisco shortening for the lard because it has the same texture.  The loaves rose nicely and turned out beautifully golden. I did place a pan of water in the oven during baking.  The bread has a crispy thin crust and a tender inside.  The flavor was great with a slightly sweet profile. For my taste, the bread was a tad salty so when I make it again, I will add 1.75 teaspoons of salt.

I live in an altitude of 8500 feet so  baking 
is always an adventure. I didn't change a thing and this bread came out perfect. I love the crisp outside and the soft inside.  I'm keeping one loaf to eat myself and the second loaf is going to the church's potluck tomorrow. I will definitely make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with bread that was far too dense to be considered Cuban bread, which is supposed to be almost comically airy.
 I made it an additional time with more yeast and more rising time and nada.

Unfortunately, the only other reviewers haven't apparently had Cuban bread before, so I'm not sure how they are rating this. Can I put butter on it? Sure. Is it Cuban? Nope. Will I stick it in my Cafe con Leche? Nope.

If you think it sounds like mine didn't turn out as intended, please advise. I'm simply making the rounds through recipes, which I follow exactly, attempting to get a taste of home.

This was my first try and Chef John's Cuban bread. I started it  only because I am waiting for my sourdough starter to finish for my try at sourdough beard. Everything came together well. I used Crisco instead of lard but otherwise no changes. The loaves turned out pretty well except I expected them to be slightly taller. The dough rose quickly but I was a little surprised when I scored the top of the loaf before baking the loaf seemed to deflate and did not rise again in the oven. I would have given 5 stars except for that. We already had a basic ham and cheese sandwich with one loaf. Now to try a true Cuban sandwich with the other.

Came out great!  That’s a good thing, since apparently no one in SW VA ever heard of Cuban bread, (I kid you not.)
However, I am unable to locate Chef John’s directions for keeping the starter going.  This starter is not like the one with which I am familiar.

So I had some trouble with part 2, I did not stir it after mixing the packet of yeast and water and when i came back 15mins later i saw no bubbles. Stirred it, came back 15mins later and still no bubbles. I wasn't sure if i had done something wrong or not, just saw the thick-ish consistency I saw in the video so i continued with the steps. 


For a first time at making bread, this wasn't half bad. I had no idea what i was doing with the kneading but i think i did fine. My bread came out a bit harder than I wanted because i overbaked it by like..5mins.

Is this cuban bread though? Well, the taste of it sure isn't, and the bread I made did not come out that way. However bread is still bread and i enjoyed making it, and eating it!

Made it last night, made a couple of mistakes but I’m trying again tonight.  The loaves turned out ok, good flavor! I’m roasting a pork butt this weekend to make the Medianoche sandwiches (that’s the name of the Cuban sandwich)

I had the same problem as another baker -  after the second stage of rising as soon as I touched the blade to the loaf the dough deflated.  So disappointing!

The first time I made this bread it was for Chef John's Cuban sandwiches. It was the star of the sandwich. I replaced the lard with three tablespoons of ordinary Crisco and followed the recipe the rest of the way. The bread was soft and had a good flavor. So many breads I have made are tasteless, but that may be from my inexperience. I would like to try this bread as dinner rolls too.

I love everything about this bread, not only is it great for cubanos but it even makes a simple bacon sandwich a million times better. I’m at high altitude and I still follow the recipe exactly as it’s written with fantastic results.

The recipe was relative easy to make and came out with a crisp, crusty exterior and soft, fragrant interior. I cut some and used it for hamburger buns and they were great.

I had to make some tweaks and changes to really make this work BEST.   

I used quick-rising yeast versus just normal active yeast, and I had to try a couple flour types at my local grocery until I got the one that really works great.  Typically more expensive is better.   

The last important trick - have a pan of water at the bottom of your over during the bake cycle - because long with wetting your bread - the steam the water creates during the baking really enhances the crust to the correct thin crispy/crunchy level.

I’ve tried this recipe FOUR times.  Followed the instructions to the letter then tried to vary how long the dough proofs but each and every time the dough collapsed when I went to the baking step.  If I could give this recipe -1000 stars I would.  I’ve made bread for years and never had this much trouble and waste of time.  NEVER AGAIN
