This was so easy and very good!! Befor adding the crushed crackers, I sprinkled a garlic herb seasoning on. It was quite tasty and I will definitely prepare again!!I think next time I may also add chopped water chestnuts, just to give it more texture.

A really easy side dish.  Definitely good as a low-fat dish, making with fat-free cream cheese, skim milk, and reduced-fat crackers.  I added garlic powder, seasoned salt & hot sauce for additional flavor.

This made a tasty side dish. I added 1/4 chopped onion, two garlic cloves, and, about 1/3 c. parm cheese. Mixed in seasoned bread crumbs  Topped with more parm cheese. Yum!

I cooked this for Thanksgiving this year, as my first Thanksgiving with a husband and the first time I cooked for the family!  It went over so well and now they want me to bring it to Christams too!  :)

My husband, not a spinach lover, raved about this. I added some feta cheese, a pinch of garlic powder and some minced onion. I'll definitely make this again.

I cooked the spinach and cream cheese in a sauce pan over med heat untill the cream cheese started to melt. (I didn't use the milk) I added half of 1 small purple onion, minced, and continued to cook the mixture for about 10 mins. I sprinkled a little nutmeg in once I had removed it from the heat. I pressed it into my baking dish and sprinkled it with minteray jack, cheddar, and parm cheese. It baked up very nicely. Very good flavour.

Very good. I added about 1/3 cup of sour cream to the mixture for a little added creaminess.. Husband really liked this, and he is picky!!

So good!!!  Added a little blue cheese and season salt.  Husband loved it so much he wants me to make it again tonight.  Used low fat cream cheese and still tasted super rich.

Quick and easy side.  I've used the fat free cream cheese and omitted the crackers and it's still easy and good.

Like others I added some items to this recipe, it sounds a little bland as is. I sauteed a sliced onion almost to caramelization and then tossed in some chopped shallot. I didn't use the lemon pepper. Instead I used a large sprinkle of nutmeg and some salt and pepper. I heated the cream cheese and spinach in the same cast iron skillet until I could mix it well and then sprinkled it with the juice of one lemon before baking. It was delicious. I think this is a good base for adding what you might have on hand to perk it up.

The other reviewers were correct.  This recipe needs something more, like garlic or onions.  Nothing great.

The cream cheese was runny and overpowering, the lemon pepper was just the wrong taste, and the crackers seemed like a strange afterthought.

I cooked this as a side dish for my family. They loved it, but I have to doctor it up with my own seasoning mix.

I love creamed spinach but this wasn't as good as the one I normally make- I didn't have cream of celery soup on hand so I used this recipe as a substitute for my standard one- I added in onion and garlic and used seasoned salt rather than the lemon pepper- I wasn't crazy about the crackers on top- good but not great

I really like spinach but I wasn't too crazy about this one.  I noticed a lot of others reviewers dressed it up a bit and then felt they had positive results.  I would make this one again but only after some modifications.  In which case, I may as well try some of the other already dressed up spinach recipes on here.
