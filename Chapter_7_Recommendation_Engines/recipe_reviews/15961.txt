This is truly an excellent pie. One minor problem with the recipe keeps it from getting 5 stars: after baking the gingersnap crust, if you just put ice cream right on, the crust starts falling apart. The answer: freeze your baked crust for around an hour and you will be able to put on the other layers with ease. As far as taste goes, this pie is wonderful.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it! The only thing is that it needs to be thawed out before serving(which it doesn't say in the recipe)-it was SO HARD to cut the crust. Other than that, it was DELICIOUS!

this was wonderful, a treat for kids and grownups alike!  We had it for Thanksgiving in Jamaica and it was perfect!  Just remember to use a DEEP DISH pie plate, as it really fills it up!

This pie was SO EASY to make...and tasted so GOOD!!!  I made the crust in the evening and left it in the (baking stone) pie plate. The next day I just had to finish it...what a breeze, yet it looks and tastes like it would be diffiult to make!  My 10 yr old son asked me never to make "traditional pumpkin pie" again...he really enjoyed it.  It cut beautifully in my pampered cef pie plate.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

Excellent pie. Because I love pumpkin I only added 1 cup of cool whip for a really powerful pumpkin flavor. Doing that also made all of the ingredients fit perfectly into the pie pan. My only complaint was that the ice cream got a little icy. Any suggestions to remedy that for next time?

My sister makes a recipe similar to this but the pumpkin layer was always kinda blah. I thought I'd try this recipe and oh boy! The pumpkin layer was so delicious! The whipped topping makes the pumpkin creamy and with a very pleasing texture. The ingredients of this recipe come together perfectly! But like everyone else I was getting a little annoyed about my crust breaking. But after the first bite, my furrowed brow disappeared. This recipe is so much more interesting then regular pumpkin pie.I will certainly make this every year!

I'm really bummed because I thought this pie would be terrific.
I followed the instructions very carefully (and I bake pretty frequently), but my crust froze to a concrete like substance.  Not sure what happened, but the ice cream was melting by the time the crust was soft enough to break apart.
I would have be mortified if I'd cooked this for anyone but my immediate family.  (it was a good source of laughs).
The pie had a nice flavor but really needed the zing of the gingerbread crust.

This recipe is fab. My Hubby is a huge pumpkin pie fan, but when I made this, he and i both agreed that it is even yummier than traditional pumpkin pie, and it is so much easier!I woulad also like to add that the crust is probably the best part! the cookies make it so crumbly and crunchy, what a lovely texture.

This pie was fantastic!!  I used a deep dish though or else I would have had too much filling.
Great alternative to traditional pumpkin pie.

This recipe is delicious. Tastes the same as a normal pumpkin pie but frozen. My husband absolutely loved it. I always make two at a time. Stays good for a long time in the freezer! Thanks for the recipe!!

YUM YUM! I topped with almond slivers, added an extra half cup of pumpkin and decreased whipped topping by half cup. Turned out great!

I like the idea of this recipe, and the consistency. But there is WAY too much sugar! I could barely eat a whole slice. The pumpkin layer is already sitting on a bed of gingersnaps and ice cream, and made mostly of whipped cream. WHY is there another cup of sugar in there?? I would cut the sugar by AT LEAST half if I make this again.

I made this recipe as directed, except I used a 10 inch crust (it wouldn't have fit otherwise). Everyone said they loved it, but I think it was too sweet. Next time I will add half the amount of sugar. I didn't have an issue with my crust falling apart, but I did bake it for 8 minutes and let it cool overnight in the fridge before adding the filling.

Mine turned out perfectly (not sticky, not a mess).  I used real whipped cream.  For someone who loves pumpkin, this is a nice twist.  I will make this again.

I have not had the best luck with frozen pies, or some pumpkin desserts, so I was skeptical.  This was very yummy.  The texture was nice, and the flavor was excellent.  I didn't have any gingersnaps handy, so I used a pre-made graham cracker crust that I toasted in the oven at 400 degrees for 6 minutes, and it tasted great. Everyone loved it.

This was delicious...especially the crust. Served it to a group and they loved it. Bet you could just use a prepared pumpkin pie mix that has all of the spices and sugar in it too.

Everyone in my family raved over this pie .. even those who dislike traditional pumpkin.  It was definitely a hit I will be making again and again.

Very easy and very yummy.  I don't like regular pumpkin pie, but I love this.  I followed the recipe exactly, and wouldn't change a thing.

Excellent!  I am tempted to try a caramel swirl or butter pecan ice cream instead of vanilla the next time I make it.

This is really a delicious pie. My mother-in-law does not care for pumpkin pie and she liked this very much. It is similar to pumpkin ice cream (if you can imagine such a thing).
