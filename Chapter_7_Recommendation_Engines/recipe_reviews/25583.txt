This was an excellent cake -moist delicious and flavorful- however I did make some changes.  I added 2 cups of frozen cherries (the grocery store did not have any fresh ones at the time) because I thought this would taste better.  Next time I think I will add even more cherries or maybe replace the water/buttermilk with  cherry juice to enhance the flavor.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and 1 1/2 oz of chocolate to the frosting.  I also made the frosting with fresh 100% cherry juice so it would have a fresh, rather than canned flavor.

Why is this recipe being ignored? It is fantastic!! I made this cake for Valentine's day for my husband. It is the first cake from scratch I have ever made, and it was perfect in every way.. The cake was delicious and moist and easy to make. I did add a little more chocolate to the frosting. I decorated the top with cherries..this cake would be beautiful, elegant and tasty enough for any occasion. I've made it many times and there is never a crumb left over!

I have yet to make this cake - however, I havae tasted it.  I am a Foods Judge for 4-H and Open Class at county fairs in our area and surrounding areas.  A 13 year old 4-Her made this and it was AWESOME!  She received a State Fair Purple on it.  I asked where she got the recipe and she said here at this site.  I am anticipating on making this VERY soon.  What a wonderful tasting and eye appealing cake

This recipe is a keeper! It's very moist and delicious. The only thing I changed from the original directions was to double the amount of cherries (and I didn't chop finely, I left them kinda chunky). It was fantastic!

This is very similar to a recipe that I had years ago, and then had lost.  I was happy to find this.  The cake has a rich flavor and great texture.

I give it 4 stars because I made some changes. I used butter instead of shortening in the cake batter,and 3/4cup 100% cherry juice in place of the water and a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 2 cups of frozen cherries in place of the maraschino cherries. When it came to the frosting, I used 100% cherry juice, and used way more than 1/3 cup. I used 4oz instead of 1oz of the chocolate in the frosting, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract in place of the almond.  I also had to heat the frosting on top of a double boiler to get it smooth and creamy since it was a disgusting lump when the frosting ingredients were cold.
Now for the taste...it was very chocolately and fudgy. Next time I would perhaps add something to make the cake a little moister, but not sure what...maybe applesauce, or a little oil.

This cake looked terrible and tasted worse!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it was very very dry.

Very yummy cake! Moist and delish! I prefer my cherries coarsely chopped, but otherwise, I made no changes. Will definitely make this one again! Thanks :)
