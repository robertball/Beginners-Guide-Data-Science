I thought this looked good enough that i should have a rating, so i tried it. I ran short on celery so i added a little celery salt. Also used sweet relish in place of the pickle. This is as good as any other Tuna Mac Salad on this site. And i like the fact that this was someones Grandma's recipe.

This Tuna Salad recipe is  PERFECT just  the way it is published.  Don't try to put your own little twist on it.. just leave it alone.  My family and guests loved it!  It will become a new family tradition. Thanks for sharing a GREAT recipe Grandma Wells and Family...  delicious!!!

Really good....my family enjoyed. I used 13 oz box of mini wagon wheel pasta, 2 cans of albacore tuna, light mayo, reduced fat shredded cheddar, vidalia onion, the celery and had to use pickle relish..oh and of course added defrosted frozen baby peas. Yummy! Thanks!

This is how tuna salad is supposed to be.  If you want fancy'schmancy then go make up your own recipe and leave this one alone!  Thank you Grandma Wells.  Did you happen to know my Great	Grandma Snopl?  Her tuna salad tasted remarkably similar to yours!  Yum!

I just made this to take for lunch a couple of days this week. I shreaded the cheese because we don't have the bigger elbow macaroni in the Netherlands, only little bitty ones, and I didn't want the cheese to be bigger than the noodles. I also haved the recipe because I live alone and get really sick of eating the same foods too often. However, I am not so sure I would get sick of this! Very yummie.

Thanks so much!  Couldn't recall the ingredients to this old favorite - glad someone did!  I skipped the celery just for personal preference.

I added quartered cucumber slices, halved grape tomatoes and sliced hard boiled eggs (3) to this already very good recipe. Then and only then, it resembled what my mother did to her potato salad.

I forgot to add the cheese and it's delicious. I bet it will be better when I add some cheese in tomorrow.  Used the mayo that is made with olive oil for a calorie cut. And added a few red grapes.  Yummy!!  Also put in 12 oz of tuna instead of 6.

Very yummy... but a bit heavy on the onions... and I omitted the cheese... a wee bit to heavy on the calories for me.  :)

I made this per recipe but did not like it. I couldn't taste the tuna so I added a second can and still did not enjoy it. I won't make it again.

Best tuna macaroni salad I have ever tried! The only thing that I did differently was added more onion :-) delicious
