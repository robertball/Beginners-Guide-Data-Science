I made  this for a large group of people and everyone loved it! It was so yummy!  I made a few changes to adapt to what i had, or could find at the local grocer, i could only find tamarind chutney, so i used that, i couldnt find muscavado sugar, so i used brown sugar, i used natural peanut butter, and added a bit of yellow curry powder to the sauce. It was too cold outside and my bbq was tempermental so i baked in a 375 oven until they looked done. SO MOIST. huge success and i would definitely make again!

this was exceptionally good and very well received.  the marinade never thickened and i worried about that a bit, but it still tasted great.  the satay sauce tasted like something i'd get in a restaurant.  i'd definitely make this again.

I was unable to find tamarind paste, lemon grass, or muscovado sugar - so I substituted Worcestershire sauce, lemon zest, and brown sugar.  Delicious despite the substitutions.  Peanut sauce was great!

Excellent recipe - I even found it very kid-friendly! As usual I tweaked it some, but the tastes and textures are all outstanding as written. I sauteed the chicken instead of grilling and served it over linguini noodles with toasted sesame oil, then ladled the sauce over all.  A side order of stir-fried snow peas, carrots, red bell pepper, water chestnuts, and steamed brocolli balanced the creamy with crisp.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

I have never cooked Thai before, and this turned out simply gorgeous.   I found my marinade thickend up well by leaving it in the fridge overnight before using it....then no problems.  Only critiscm I have is that I found the sauce too sweet for me, but will omit sugar next time.  Otherwise....great!

This was fantastic!  The blend of flavors perfect!  I server this on a bed of rice.  My husband said it was the best sauce he ever tasted.  I followed the recipe as written and would do so again.  Thanks this is going to be a regular meal here.  The only thing I might try is adding some grape tomatoes to the skewer next time.

Wonderfully tangy chicken.  Great dish as a centerpiece or side to any meal.  Wonderfully rich also.  The peanut sauce could have been more flavorful, perhaps take that into account if making this.  Perhaps use twice the spice or an extra half of the spices/peanut butter.  I baked mine in the oven at 475 degrees, cooked up quick, lightly charred, and juicy... just like they would on a grill.  Will be making this again and again, thanks!

This is absolutely worth every bit of effort!  The only ingredient I couldn't find was muscovado sugar, so I substituted brown sugar.  It was delicious, and all five of my picky kids gobbled it up!  YUMMY!!!

Used brown sugar for Muscovado. Made the marinade exactly.  Doubled the sauce ingredients and quadrupled the peanut butter and omitted the peanuts. Used 20 oz of lite cocount milk. Marinated chicken for 12 hours just because made it the night before. I have NEVER had such tender chicken...the chicken breast were organic. It was like a Filet Mignon that melts in your mouth. YUM! Hope you try this recipe!

Thumbs up from everyone!  10 year old boy proclaimed, "I think this is the best meal I ever had."  Picky 17 year old girl went back for seconds!  

I did use chicken thigh meat instead of chicken breast, it grilled up great.  Served it with julienne carrots and white rice.  The sauce was very good, and very easy to make hotter by just adding a bit more curry paste.  Definately a keeper!

For those who haven't used lemongrass ever, you may want to try the following:  Remove most of the woody parts, coarsely chop the stems and crush by hand to release the flavor.  Unless you have very very fresh lemongrass, you will just end up with woody slivers if you try to food process.

I am giving this five stars because it is amazing, but if you make the sauce recipe as suggested, you will end up with a bland coconut soup.  So I suggest using only chunky peanut butter instead of peanut butter/peanuts and using 1/2 cup as well as doubling the rest of the spices.  My sister in law says it's better than restaurants!

I *hate* peanuts, but as I usually do in Thai cooking, I swapped cashew butter and chopped cashews.  Excellent!

I added extra peanuts (because more peanuts is better!), added 1/2 tablespoon of fish sauce (dipping sauce was turning out too sweet), and used brown sugar in place of muscovado sugar. It was so good! I made it for a dinner party and everybody loved it!

This was one of the best things I've ever tried. My company LOVED it and I have to say, don't expect better in a restaurant... this is awesome. I didn't have the muscovado sugar, so I substituted brown sugar as others have done. I also could not find tamarind paste, so I used a small amount of a jarred sauce that I found that had tamarind paste as one of it's main ingredients. Chicken was super tender. I also marinated for 3 hours. LOVE!

The chicken and marinade was wonderful however the peanut sauce was icky.  I would make the chicken again but use a different peanut sauce for dipping.

This was great.  Even the finicky eater loved it.  In my version, I added sweeten coconut flakes to the marinade bag after blending the original marinade recipe.

the chicken marinade was incredible! we loved the mix of flavors. chicken was very tender, too. the peanut sauce was not the best... too liquidity and we didn't think the taste complimented the chicken. perhaps a different peanut sauce would be better?

Chicken had a great flavor and was easy to prepare. Sauce had a good flavor, but way too much coconut milk for my liking...it was much more of a cream sauce than a peanut sauce. Next time I would use half the coconut milk.

Made as written.  Very good, but lacked the strong spicy and sour notes of traditional street vendor satay.  Served it with  mushroom and Bok   Choy.

Baked this in the oven rather than on the grill. Followed the recipe as is, and it was wonderful. Will definitely make this again.

Marinade and chicken was awesome.  I likely did not do the sauce correctly.  It lacked flavor, and was more runny than a true sauce.  Like I said, the sauce never really thickened for me.  Next time I will thicken the sauce, not use peanuts, but use smooth peanut butter and definitely add a "kick" to the sauce with a Thai Garlic Hot Sauce or something similar.  It was good, next time should be better, so thanks for the recipe!

A family favorite. The chicken is great, moist and flavorful as is. I have made this several times and never used the Tamarind paste because I can't easily find it, but you don't need it for a great result. I saw that another recipe uses fresh ginger so the last time I made this, I incorporated about a tablespoon of fresh chopped ginger and it was a nice extra hint of flavor. As for the peanut sauce, it has always turned out too thin such that I've used cornstarch to thicken it up or turned to other recipes. Do be sure you are not using light coconut milk as that definitely lends to a thin sauce.

I could not find tamarind paste, so I used sriracha sauce. Maybe this defeated the spirit of the dish, but I found the hot against the cool lemongrass was delicious.

Really good.  You can halve the sauce though...there is enough for an army.

I give this 5 stars only if the peanut butter is tripled/quadrupled and the brown sugar is doubled/tripled! Very tasty! Thanks for posting!!

I bought tamarind  from Indian grocery store, cut 1 inch piece, soak in half cup of water for maybe an hour, or heat up in the microwave for one minute then leave it for an hour, after an hour mix it well and strain, that way you will get half cup of tamarind paste. Hopefully this will help.

I made this for a non-standard Easter Dinner Party along with some various Vietnamese Salad Rolls and everyone loved the recipe... Great adaptation!

I decided to forgo the skewers and used chicken tenderloins on the Traeger in just a few minutes they were ready for me to slice it diagonally for a great presentation. Only issue was that I should have made twice as much...

I used lemongrass paste instead of the fresh- all my guests raved about this chicken.  The dipping sauce was a bit runny, but it had yummy flavor. Definately will make again- often!

I have yet to try this most delicious looking recipe, but I loved reading it. I plan to make it SOON! However, I was hoping Thai ChefMarty could provide the recipe on the cucumbersalad in this picture, assuming the photo is his and not another person's. I had a satay dish that had a yummy cucumber salad that looked like that, but do not know how to prepare one. Thank youfor this recipe. Looking forward to making it.

I made a different peanut sauce recipe (Steve Raichlen) but the chicken itself was wonderful!  I let the chicken marinate about 3 hours and would do so again.

Love it!!  Love the addition of lemon grass here!  Used the recipe from Indonesian satay for the peanut sauce- just because I know we like that one!

Absolutely amazing recipe.  So quick and easy to prepare.  Very impressive flavour.  Something you could easily serve to guests and they would think that you spent hours on this meal.  I too had to make a few minor subs...lemon zest for the lemon grass and brown sugar for the muscovado sugar (although I will look for this sugar in the stores) and Frank's Red Hot added into the sauce as I only had green curry.  Absolutely 5 stars and then some.

My family loved it too.  The only change I made was to use smooth peanut butter. I couldn't find coconut milk; so had very thick coconut cream.  I cut it with skim milk to equal the 14 ounces for the ingredient in the peanut sauce.  Even our two year old grandbaby loved it without the sauce.

Made the recipe as is, except used 1 tsp of the red curry paste, and used 1tsp of lemon grass puree as I did not have a fresh stalk, and it was fantastic.  Used 5 boneless thighs which is my cut of choice when i grill/Tandoor. Tends to stay more juicy and take on the flavor of the marinade. cooked in the green egg at 550 F, for 18 minutes.  Next time round i may try to puree the sauce before serving.

What a hit with the family! It was so good that my 16 year old daughter insisted on taking the meager leftovers to school for lunch today! I found all of the ingredients at my local grocery store except the taramind paste, which I found at an Indian grocery store (who knew one was 5 miles away?). I suggest the tubed minced lemongrass (they sell ginger like this too in my market's produce section). You get 6 stalks in the tube and then you can refrigerate it for later use. I followed the recipe to the tee and it was perfect. I even made a cucumber salad with it and served it with naan....Target sells excellent naan from it's bakery. Enjoy...we will again soon!

Delicious and really flavorful! Couldn't find tamarind paste and muscovado sugar, so I subbed with Worsterchire and brown sugar. My dipping sauce came out watery (maybe because I forgot to add the tomato paste), but was still very good.
