Excellent recipe!  I doubled the recipe and was a bit short on brown sugar, so had to use a cup of white sugar which may have made it slightly sweeter than actual Kahlua, but still good!  I also used an extra 1/2 cup of ground coffee because I like a strong coffee flavor.  Makes a very tasty White Russian and makes great gifts!  My friends were very impressed and it saved me money on Christmas shopping, especially since I got a decent bottle of vodka on sale!

I tried several coffee liqueur recipes on the internet and this is definitely the best.  The difference is the brown sugar...makes the end result very thick and syrupy.  I don't even like commercial Kahlua, but I can drink this straight.  Try rum or brandy instead of the vodka.  Enjoy!

Fabulous, I used brewed espresso because I like a a more robust coffee flavour...in fact I have Cuban coffee beans and just brewed the coffee with the sugar in the Cuban style and then went from there.

I'd guess this would be great with a little less sugar and rum....next time!

This Kahlua is great!  I enjoy it as white russian, but with skim milk instead of cream to cut down on calories and fat.  It's really easy to make and I definetly recommend it!

Meh. I'll save the time and effort and just go buy Starbucks Coffee Liqueur. I know for a fact it will taste great and won't have to worry about messing it up. Thanks!

I cut this recipe way back so I could see how I liked the flavor.  While it is very good, it did not taste like Kahlua to me.  The sugar mix got quite thick on me before I added the vodka, so it took me a while to mix it in.  I used instant espresso granules for extra richness.  This is definitely a sipping drink that is quite good!

This is amazing! I was worried that vodka would make this thin and watery, but it turned out thick, rich, and perfectly flavored. It is so easy to make, and there is no need to pay big money for coffee-flavored liquors. Great quality!
