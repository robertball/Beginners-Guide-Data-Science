This is a great recipe! Meat was tender, juicy and very, very tasty. I made more steaks than I needed, and had two left... I decided to cut them in strips, brown them in a wok and then I added fresh mushrooms (slised), green and red peppers and sliced onions. Poured approximately 2 tablespoons of marinade over it... cooked some rice, and had a great meal! Next time I use this recipe, I'll deliberately put more steaks in. Very yummy.

I marinated steaks overnight in this recipe and they came out pretty good.  The thinner ends of beef absorbed a lot of the soy sauce and were slightly salty (even using reduced sodium soy sauce)but still tasty.  I wouldn't marinate this longer than 1 night due to the large amount of soy sauce.

Great marinade!  I used low sodium soy sauce and ginger powder.  I let sirloin steak set in this in a ziploc bag for a day and a half.  The result was absolutly delicious.  We grilled it over charcoal and the orange juice and brown sugar gave it just a slight hint of sweetness - not too much.  The smell on the grill was great and it tasted even better.  I can't wait to try this for kabobs.  It really does make a tough cheaper cut of meat very tender.  I would take the submitter's advice and marinate it for at least 6 hours or more.

Tasty marinade!!  Easy to find ingredients, moments to put together, YUM!!  Mixed it all up, poured it in a ziploc bag, and placed london broil cut in the the marinade before leaving for work.  10+ hrs. later, I broiled it in the oven for about 15 min. each side, and served with baked potato and a salad.  Great flavor, super tender meat!!  Might marinate over night next time...  Thanks!!

This was a good marinade.  I used to make beef kabobs.  I replaced the orange juice with lemon juice, and the fresh ginger with dried ginger.  My kids and their guests devoured it.

This is a yummy recipe, after cutting the soy sauce in half.  London broil soaked for 2 days and was awesome. Thanks for sharing this quick and easy marinade.  Everyone ate it up.

I chose this recipe for two reasons: it uses simple, on-hand ingredients, and I had some less-then-great sirloin I needed to turn into GREAT sirloin. I halved the recipe and cut the beef into chunks for marinating. After marinating for 24 hours, I skewered and grilled the beef. The result was tender and flavorful, but NOT overpowering. I will definitely use this again!

A tasty marinade.  It was just a tad too salty.  I used red wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar.  I think next time I'll add more red wine vinegar and less soy sauce.  I marinated for a day and a half for a tougher cut of meat.

Not my favorite, sorry.  Much too sweet for us, the soy sauce is overwhelming.  All I tasted was the soy, OJ, brown sugar.  It definitely has an "asian" taste with these seasonings/additions.  However, I'd already added them to my meat (tri-tip) in the ziploc bag before I realized how sweet this was going to end up.  I prefer something much heartier - red wine, onion, worchester, etc. I made these with my own bacon wrapped potato wedges and grilled corn on the cob, so the flavoring really seemed out of place.  Thanks for the new idea though.  It was different.

This was very good.  I used it on tri tip and due to the cut of meat I used, I marinated it for 24 hours.  I cut the soy sauce to 1/2 cup.  
The family liked it.

DO NOT MARINATE FOR 6 HOURS!!!! I only let it marinade for 1 hour and it was perfect. If I had done it for 6+ hours it would have been way to much.  One hour you can still taste the meat with  PERFECT flavor.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground ginger and white vinegar in place of rice.  It was the best marinade I ever had!!! I used london broil and grilled 7 minutes each side for perfect medium done! My family can't wait to have it again.  Oh yea I forgot... before grilling I used powdered meat tenderizer before putting on the grill.

I used cider vinegar and ground ginger and garlic, and also added some pepper.  Tasty!  I marinated about 5 hours, but I should have done longer because my cut of steak was fairly tough.  The flavour was definitely not lacking though!

I used this on tenderloin I served to company, and I got nothing but compliments. The only change I had to make was to use dried ginger. I'm sure when I make it with fresh ginger it will be even better.

This had good flavor and came together easily with the help of my mini chop (easy minced ginger). I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut back on the soy, but think that I might have cut it back too much. I only used about 1/3 cup, so that it was about the same as the rest of the liquids, but I think that next time I try this recipe I will only cut the soy back to 1/2 cup.

Excellent marinade.  The only change I made was using lite soy sauce to cut down on the amount of sodium.

I have used this recipe for 10 years ... have a dogeared print out from 4/18/2005. Finally pinned it so I wouldn't have to hunt for it every time we grill. Have used it on steak and pork and ALWAYS get comments on how amazing it is. Only change I've made was using Balsamic vinegar instead of rice wine. Awesome recipe!

Really liked this one. Made it and had it for 3 days in the fridge before putting on the BBQ and was so tender.
Cut steak into strips and stuck on a green coriander salad. so good.

This was OK, but I didn't grill it, just stove-cooked it, so maybe that's why it wasn't as it should be. Also, I didn't have soy sauce so I used a small amount of worchester sauce. I should try it again to genuinely test it...and grill it next time!

Marinade a chuck steak over night.  The flavor was great and tender for chuck. Cooked on the grill and it was very moist and tasty. Will save this and do again.

What a nice, easy marinade!  We all really enjoyed this...I cut down slightly on the liquids in the recipe, because I only had 2 steaks to cook, but kept the seasonings pretty much the same.  The meat was very tender and we all enjoyed the flavor.  Thanks!

Marinated eye of round steaks for about 7 hours...hated the taste and it didn't soften those up at all
