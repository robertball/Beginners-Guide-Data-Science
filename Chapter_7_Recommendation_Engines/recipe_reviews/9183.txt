This is fabulous but DON'T can it! It's unsafe to do so. A water bath cannot get the core of the sauce hot enough to be safe to can. Only cubed pumpkin should be canned and only in a pressure canner. If you freeze this it will be fine.

I made this over the Christmas holiday season and gave some as gifts. I did double the recipe and tweaked the spices to suit my taste. (I used pumpkin pie spice and only a little bit of ginger.) I will definitely make it again. 
I canned it and gave the jars away to friends. I was told last night by one couple that received one,that the jar was licked clean. That is a sign of a good recipe as far as I am concerned!
We put this pumpkin butter on Grandma Johnson's scones. It was delicious. 
I added this to my personal recipe book tonight.(I loved it enough to hand write it on a recipe card!) Thanks Eleanor!

I wanted to try this because I bought a jar of Pumpkin Pecan Butter at Williams Sanoma and loved it. My husband really loved it and wanted more. I made a double batch of this and we liked it as well as the store-bought kind. We have since made many more jars and are giving them as gifts for the holiday season.

I just made this recipe to serve with warm bread and give as guest gifts for a huge party I recently had. Not only was it the first to go, but everyone has asked me for the recipe. Everyone absolutely loved it, and I enjoyed making it.  Thanks Eleanor!!

I added 1/2 cup brown sugar and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the separate spices, plus a bit less than 1/2 tsp of cloves. So very delicious with vanilla ice cream...

Taste like a pumpkin pie. I had it on toast and it was delicious.Plan to try this on pancakes. I used pumpkin pie spice and it taste good. The only problem I had was removing all the air bubbles. Will not getting all the air bubbles make it go bad? This was the first time I have done this.

WOW!!! I used fresh pumpkin that i pureed,I simmered the pumpkin untill most of the extra liquid was gone.Then i fallowed this amazing recipe!I did cut the sugar down to 3/4 Cup white sugar & added 2 TBLS brown sugar(i also used splenda white & brown sugar).Other than that i fallowed the recipe.Turned out great!Super simple & nummy!Next time i will cut the sugar down to 1/2cup as it was just tad to sweet for our taste.But, that is just our personal preference.I still have a ton more pumpkin to use.So i will make a much larger batch for Autumn gift's for friend's & teacher's.I will be trying the larger batch in my crock pot to make it a little easier & i can do it while i am work!Thanks so much for an excellent recipe :))In response to those who questioned the safety of canning pumpkin butter, you should NOT can it. Instead, it should be frozen to prevent bacterial contamination.Bring your pumpkin butter to room temp & then freeze in a plastic jelly jar's (work's great)Thaw in the fridge.Just like with freezer jam!Dont forget to leave a jar in the fridge becuase you will want to have some for your family :))

I cut the sweetness back by half and I used Truvia instead of granulated sugar. (When googling the conversion chart, I got 18 packets to equal 3/4 cup of sugar.) I made no other changes. This was very simple and the end result was absolutely perfect--the smell while cooking was fabulous. I'm glad I cut the sugar by half, I think that if I hadn't, it would have been too sweet for us.

I made a small batch to keep in the fridge and use w/i a week, so I didn't need to concern myself w/ making it safe for canning. For this purpose I found COOKING IT IN A DOUBLE BOILER reduced the stirring needed and the spluttering. I prefer it much less sweet so I used a little less than half the sugar. I also adjusted the spices to my taste: ground coriander seed instead of nutmeg (very similar taste w/o nutmeg's bitterness), subbed allspice for the major portion of the cloves but did use ~ a quarter of the cloves called for (in my batch that was just a pinch). Personally I like ginger better than cinnamon, so the proportions of those spices suited me just fine. The result is a delicious sub for good jam which is so hard to find these days for a reasonable price. I'm sure fresh baked pumpkin would make it taste better, but that would be impractical for my little household. I'm thinking of making a batch of butternut squash butter in the future by microwaving the squash.

This is the best pumpkin butter that I have ever tasted! 

I have made several batches to give as gifts over the Thanksgiving Holidays, just as I did last year.  Everyone raved about this.  As suggested, it makes the perfect hostess gift!

a little too sweet, but it has an amazing taste! I used fresh pumpkin puree (boil pieaces of pumpkin until fork tender then mash) instead, and applesauce since I was out of apple juice. Yum!

Delicious and worth the work.  I did not have apple juice on hand, so I used apple cider instead.  The butter has a rich spicy flavor.  I doubled the recipe, but it only made 7 half pints and 1 quarter pint.

Made this for the first time over Labor Day weekend.  I made it a little harder on myself because I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  I wouldn't recommend using fresh pumpkin unless you have free pumpkins sitting in your kitchen floor like I did.  Didn't get to actually try it myself until last weekend (first time we were back home since Labor Day weekend).  By then the number of jars I had was disappearing fast due to my daughter giving it away.  Got rave reviews from all recipients so tried it my self while home last weekend.  It is delicious and I plan on making another batch or two before Christmas.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this recipe last Christmas, and I got so many compliments..even from non-pumpkin people! I've had so many requests for it, I'm tripling the recipe this year. Tip: I have successfully made this recipe in my slowcooker...worked like a charm!

In response to those who questioned the safety of canning pumpkin butter,  you should NOT can it. Instead, it should be frozen to prevent bacterial contamination.

I had never tried making anything like this before, but it was so easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it comes out great, and  after treating the jars in a hot-water bath, it keeps for a really long time.  I tried to make a batch with Splenda instead of sugar for my diabetic father and it didn't work at all -- tastes like nothing.  If anyone has any suggestions to adapt this recipe to lower the sugar, please let me know.  As is, a fabulous recipe though.

This was delicious, but the yield was completely off! I followed the original recipe proportions, and ended up with one pint of pumpkin butter.  Next time, I will add less ginger, but it's not overwhelming.

This was good.  Really easy!  I did make one change.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown because that's what I typically do with my pumpkin recipes.

Very good, but I would cut back on the spices a little bit so that the pumpkin flavor would come through more.  This was so easy and inexpensive.  Great to give as a gift.

This pumpkin butter is good, but I'm looking for something that tastes a little more like pumpkin pie. Maybe tweaking the amounts of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg would do it. Thanks for the recipe, though, I enjoyed making it. It was quite easy.

Was a hit with my family when i did this last weekend. Since they were all "pumpkin spread virgins", it was a wonderful pleasant taste experience. We spread it over toast, on a thin spread of butter / margarine, it was over scones too... Very nice.   I didn't use the canned pumpkin (couldn't find one at the supermarket) so i used a whole pumpkin, boiled it for about 15 mins, cooled it off, and blend it till smooth. The result is just heavenly and very good for the non sweet-toothers cos the sweetness is balanced.  Didn't really follow the exact amount for the spices (cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg) though, half of what was instructed and even then it was quite overpowering. So if you're the mild-spice person, go easy on them. Try a dash, taste. If you want a bit more, add some, taste test again.

This is amazing! I used half the sugar it asked for and added Splenda for the other half when it was done cooking. This is so tasty on plain toast and so much better for you than butter or high-sugar jelly or jam. Yum! I will make this every time I run out of it as long as I have pumpkin :)

So delicious and fragrant! I've been eating this on toast and pancakes instead of syrup. What a great recipe! Didn't change a thing.

Great recipe.  Very easy to make and tastes wonderful.  I love that everything goes into one pan and then into your containers and into fridge/freezer.  This is very good on bagels with a little cream cheese. Yummy!  Great fast gift idea too. Thanks for submitting it!

This was very good, used homemade pumpkin puree. I did increase the spices a bit and didn't use any liquid since I made  this in my crockpot, just let it cok all day long until it thickened up to the consistency I wanted.

I LOVED this recipe and it brought back so many memories from home in Pennsylvania.  I would reccomend though HALF as many cloves-especially if you aren't a fan in the first place.  You could compensate with nutmeg, but that's my preference.  It will also keep in the fridge for over two months, as I keep mine in tupperware-I'm the only one who eats it.  I guess its lost on my English housemates!

Need to cut back on the spices, like maybe half.  Then add more as needed.  Same with the sugar.

Yum! This was soooo good!!! Although a little more work than I planned for, I'm glad to have given this a try! Making the pumpkin butter is SUPER easy, but canning it is a little work. The good news is that this makes enough for sharing so I had a ready-made Thanksgiving gift! My neighbors were very happy to receive a festive Kraft bag filled with pumpkin butter and orange scones! NOTE: I used pint size Ball jars for canning (16 oz. each) and was only able to fill two of them. This is supposed to yield five half pint sized jars (40 oz. worth), but I don't see how.... Nonetheless, I'm glad to have stumbled upon this gem. I will be making this again for sure! :-)

Great flavor! The texture (so far) is not quite what I was expecting - it's more like thick applesauce instead of the pumpkin butters I've purchased in the past, but I did use 3 1/2 cups of fresh pumpkin puree instead of the can, so maybe that's why.  I also used apple cider in place of the juice as other reviewers mentioned.  DELICIOUS, wonderfully aromatic and so, so easy to make.  I got four small jars out of one recipe - two are gifts and two are mine all mine! Yum!

I used fresh pumpkin and simmered it in water for about twenty minutes, then pureed it. Followed the directions after that, and it turned out pretty good. Very nice on toast.

My family really liked this recipe! The only change I did was I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the spices down a touch. My mom said it needed more spices which means I should have just followed the recipe exactly as is but my Aunt said it tasted fine and that she really liked it. I guess it all just depends on the person!! Great recipe though!!

Made this and rec'd rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  It was labor intensive, but well worth the effort.

Excellent for all pumpkin lovers! If you make it with fresh pumpkin like I did, you may have to simmer it a lot longer in order to get it thick enough. Regular pumpkin pie spice works great if you don't have all the other spices.

Is pumpkin butter safe to can? I have found evidence that you should freeze or refrigerate. I do want to try this recipe but will give it as gifts to put in the fridge. UPATE: This freezes very nicely! I loved making it. I put it in the crock pot on low for about 6 hours. It made the house smell lover-ly. I used the Ball brand freezer containers (1/2 pint) and can't wait for the gift giving season. THANKS!
