This smells and tastes just like the stuff you would buy at the store.  An excellent mix to use whenever poultry seasoning is called for in a recipe.

Have made this a few times and now it's my go-to poultry seasoning. I never have marjoram on hand so I replace it with oregano. Thanks!
Update:  Finally made it with marjoram and it's Perfect!

I follow a low histamine diet so I left the nutmeg out and it is still very good. I use it for chicken breaths and ground turkey, about 1 tablespoon per pound of meat. It just needs salt which you can add to your taste. I put it in my spice grinder to enhance the flavor by grinding the individual herbs and blending them well and then store them in a tightly-sealed glass jar.

Outstanding. I forgot to purchase poultry seasoning for my cornbread dressing. I made this one and it is far better than anything I could buy. I can see many uses for this recipe!  Thank you for sharing.

Thank you for posting.  It is a good blend and handy to make your own from spices on hand.  Used it today on a roasted turkey breast.  Tasty.  I am glad I didn't have to guess on ratios

My DH said it was a bit strange tasting; I skipped the rosemary as he dislikes it & omitted the nutmeg. I used dried sage I grew last summer. It tastes good to me!

Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  We have 3 friends allergic to black pepper - as in if they have anything seasoned with it they will need transport to a hospital with severe breathing obstruction/throat swelling.  Doctors tell me use of black pepper is on the rise and so is the allergy to it.  Peppercorns are a concentrated (dried) form of a plant berry,  and we all know folks with plant based allergies.  It is almost impossible to find premixed spice blends without it!  Chefs, cooks, even I didn't realize how automatic our use of black pepper is in cooking.  I have to remove every container and every blend from the kitchen, it's so habitual I won't even notice I've done it!  It's in chili powder, cajun/creole seasoning, and such standbys as Old Bay.

White pepper, green peppercorns, tellicherry pepper, many other spice peppers: it's all the same plant "piper nigrum" so can't be subbed if there's an allergy.  I'm subbing in  paprika, a ground chili pepper, about half as much.  It should work fine, just give a redder color.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!

Couldn't find poltury seasoning in the store so I had all the ingredients to make it myself. I used it to make chicken and dumplings.  I always look in allrecipes for my go to recipes etc.

Loved this!!!  Did not have the ground versions of some of these so I crumbled it with my fingers.  Used a half teaspoon in my dumplings.  Better than store bought and had everything already in my spice rack.  Thanks for posting this!

Worked out great!  Used this on the Thanksgiving Day turkey and it was wonderful.  So much better than adding yet another jar to the spice cabinet.

So easy to make and I used for my stuffing and turkey. Probably the best turkey I’ve ever made. Made it as is with no changes and it was perfect. Plus all the ingredients were standard from my pantry!!

I used this in stuffing and it worked out wonderfully. The only ingredient I didn't have was marjoram and I didn't feel that the end result lacked anything.

Made no changes and would make it again. In fact, I already have and tripled it for storing.  Use it in a recipe for Memphis style ribs.

I had a recipe calling for poultry seasoning.  Since it is needed rarely in our home, I used this recipe.  It turned out great.  I did use just a little less nutmeg since it isn't a favorite.  Thus is a keeper that I will use again.

I will never buy premixed poultry seasoning again. Not only do I use this in my cornbread dressing, I also season my pork loin roast with it and the results are spectacular!

Good start for a first try. I opted to not use rosemary (as I only have fresh on hand from my garden) so that may have changed things a bit. Also, next time I will reduce the sage amount - we felt it was a bit heavy on sage.  Will try this one again and see what happens.
