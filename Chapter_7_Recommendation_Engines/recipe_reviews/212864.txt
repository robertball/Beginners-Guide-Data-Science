I have been looking for a cookie recipe like this forever.  This is a great one! Here are a few tips.  Bake on a silpat, helps with even baking and clean up.  When I rolled out my dough I used a combination of flour and sugar to avoid an overly flourly taste. Depending on the size balls you seperate your dough into you should be able to get 12-16 cookies out of each one. Dont over fill these, maybe a tsp of filling or it spreads out and makes a mess. Also these freeze very well... just seperate layers with wax paper.  Dont garnish with powdered sugar until you are ready to serve. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

GREAt pastry! We never had Cream cheese in Poland- only farmers cheese- they were NEVER used in cookies!  this is a true Kolaczky pastry!  i too, dusted and rolled out in powdered sugar and it helped to roll the dough in ONE direction. I actually warm up some preserves- mostly apricot or plum butter (powidla) and stir in a touch of cornstarch so that my preserves dont get too runny.  SMACZNEGO!

this is old school polish cookie. it was so simple. i tried adding 2 tsp of filling and it made the cookie look messy. i wish i would have read the reviews before i tried baking this. using less filiing kept the filling inside the cookie. without powdered sugar, it did taste plain but when i dusted with powdered sugar it had a nice taste. i am not a huge fan of sickening sweet cookies. it went well with a cup of tea. will make again. i will try different fillings.

If your great-granny made these she was a saint. I wrangled the dough and added another several cups of flour while rolling it out.  Also I added about 1/2 cup sugar to the dough before rolling. I think the sorta off taste is the sour cream. On the plus side, the finished cookies were delicious with a dusting of powdered sugar. I used Solo fillings in apricot and cherry.  Taste good but too, too much trouble---I'm a bar cookie kind of baker---down and dirty and easy.

I did not care for this recipe. I tried adding more sugar and I also tried rolling them in a combination of flour and powdered sugar. I even tried an egg wash then sprinkling them with sugar and even then rolling them in powdered sugar afterwards.  My husband and I kept tasting and tweaking and couldn't get rid of the strong dough taste.

I have very successfully used a very similar recipe for years: use 4 sticks of butter though and no sugar or water. Just mix the yeast in with the sour cream. I may try this one someday.

Make these at Christmas - never use margarine
in baking cookies - REAL BUTTER ONLY -
also jam or jelly just spreads out onto the cookie sheet - use solo products or similar fillings. When working with the dough keep chilled in frig-easier to work with - these also freeze well-just freshen up w/powered sugar.
