I found this to be a delightful alternative and worth adding to my menu rotation.  To all of you who are having fits over the fact that there is that terrible Italian sausage in the menu.  Please do me a favor. If you don't like a recipe, DON'T EAT IT.  Not everyone in this world is a health freak.  I am 72 years old, from Italian ancestry and doing just fine.  In the future, do 2 things when you see the dreaded "sausage"  1. Don't cook it.  2. Shut up.

This is such an easy and tasty recipe! I wanted to say to those who worry that, while it is delicious, it isn't that healthful, that it tastes just as good using veggie Italian sausage (Lightlife brand has 140 calories and 7 g fat per link) and 2% milk mozzarella. (You could just use an egg white, too, but I didn't bother with that.) I'm a professional chef, but my husband and I are trying to eat more healthfully, so I look for ways to cut calories and fat while still being yummy - and Italian dishes like this are often really good candidates.   And a hint to those who had a difficult time getting the eggplant flesh out of its shell: try scoring the eggplant before you oil and bake it, maybe even cutting the 1/2 inch around the shell ... works wonders!

This was a very good recipe though I made some changes. I used 1lb ground italian sausage instead of 1/2lb link sausage, and therefore went heavy on the other ingredients.  The ground sausage gave the filling much more flavor than the link would have.  I also added ground oregano, fresh cilantro, parmesan cheese, and extra moz. cheese.  My gas oven cooks hot and really withered my eggplant skin on the initial roast, so I turned it down to 375 for the second bake.  My husband loved and I will make again.

Fabulous!  I also added onion and peppers to the stuffing.  Very yummy, will make again, this may have to become part of the weekly, eggplant season menu in our house!  Didn't know you could do that with an eggplant!  I used home made sauce with fresh tomatoes from the garden.  This recipe doesn't tell you, but seed the eggplant first.

Very tasty!  I added onions while browning the sausage and cut down the 2nd stage cooking time for the eggplant to only 10-15 minutes because the cheese was getting very brown.  A tip to scoop out the insides: cut with a sharp knife the exact outline of where you want to scoop and then use a spoon to scoop out the flesh.  It is much easier than only using a spoon.

I made this tonight for dinner. Excellent. I only doubled the recipe. I never liked eggplant really. I made for my husband who is a big fan of eggplant, But I have to say I ate every bit of it! However it is a very heavy dish, I served pasta on the  side with the extra sauce, but it was too much.This eggplant dish is fine with a salad alone. I will make it again for many years to come. YUM!

Very yummy and pretty darned easy. I made this in the afternoon, then cooked it off at dinner time. Some changes I made were I added onion and green pepper when cooking the meat. I also used both sausage and hamburger. I added fresh parsley & basil and omitted the egg. I don't think the egg was all that necessary. My family all thought the dish was wonderful - we actually had extra filling, so I also filled a couple green pepper. Yum!!

EXCELLENT!! I've made this twice now. Both times I added onion. Also, I substituted the spaghetti sauce with bruchetta. It made a bit more chunky, so yummy! We couldn't eat it up fast enough!

This was very delicious.
In stead of sausage (we don't eat pork in my family) I used frozen meat balls  (8 for this recipe) that I thawed in the microwave then chopped.
I skipped the egg, the filling held well together with just the tomato sauce and the cheese.
I will definitely make this again and again.

Pretty good recipe. I followed almost to the letter. I did however use Spicy italian sausage, and it was TOO spicy. Kinda ruined the dish. Next time I will use Mild.

Wonderful recipe. Even people who don't like eggplant will like this!   I make something like this, but I use large unblemished zucchinis.  Scrape out the seeds and fibers, save them and mix them in with the sausage mixture as in the recipe above.  Do not pre-cook the zucchini.

I make this a lot, but I use 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef, in a food processor I add shiitake mushrooms zucchini, yellow squash and chives, red pepper, spinach if you like.  and pulse to the consistency of bread crumbs and then add to the meat. This will cut back on the meat being dry

This recipes is to die for! I substituted Morningstar Farms Sausage-style recipe crumbles for the sausage since I'm a vegetarian, and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

My eggplant hating kids and hubby all ate this up (I did scoop out the stuffing for the kids). the only thing i did was saute 1/3 red onion, chopped, and a few finely chopped yellow peppers slices in a bit of the sausage fat after that was done cooking. needed to add some more veggies in there discreetly! my 2 years old literally licked the plate clean! and the extras i made for lunch tomorrow were all gone, too. definite keeper, and easy to make or make ahead.

I totally agree with RMORONE, I'm not of Italian ancestry, I'm a proud Australian. I like healthy food too, but like to try different types of recipes at least once. If it needs tweaking a little , so be it, it's all about PERSONAL TASTE, ideas help others. In Australia I can't buy Italian sausage mix, so I've bought linked sausages and pressed out the mixture. Added a little garlic and chopped red capsicum to the browning meat with fresh parsley, basil and a pinch of salt. It works wonderfully well, also used this mix stuffed into red or green capsicums with tarragon or corriander. Will make this Mediterranean flavoured dish again repeatedly, thankyou Tanya for submitting this base recipe.

A very delicious recipe that translates well to wood-fired cooking or cooking on a grill.  This adds another dimension to the wonderful dish by the smoky flavoring from the grill.

This was great!!  My only substitution was that I had to use ground beef instead of sausage (my beef was on the verge of going around the bend, lol) but it was still delicious & very filling.  I ended up taking some leftovers with me to work to share with my coworker, who also enjoyed it!  5 stars from me (and him)!

This recipe is super.   I love making it on the grill.   I grill my eggplant 1st, stuff it with the pre-cooked mixture (that I've done on the stove top) and then finish it off back on the grill.  Yummy!

This is a great recipe and has led me to even better things, and it's relatively inexpensive.  I've made a couple of variations on it now, but I usually add black olives, cottage cheese and jalapenos into the mix.  I also use turkey sausage instead of regular sausage to reduce the caloric intake.  It bakes perfectly, like a little eggplant boat.  It's also good if you top it with panko or bread crumbs and some cheese and bake a few minutes longer.  Overall this is an excellent creation and I'm grateful to have this recipe in my repertoire!

As good as you think this sounds, it tastes even better! I've already made some further adjustments to the original recipe and after making it for my family, I made it for my friends. Couldn't be better.  My change? Using the same recipe but making individual servings as an appetizer for a party by baking a phyllo dough/cupcake size crust and adding the sausage-stuffed eggplant as the filler. WOW!

So good!  My boyfriend said it was "5 star" and "something you would order in a nice restaurant"--and he doesn't even usually like eggplant!  We had a small eggplant and so I had some of the filling left over, which I mixed in with orzo for an awesome side dish.  Also served with sauteed green beans and pinot noir.

I needed new ideas for all the eggplant we've had recently. We really enjoyed this but I made some changes. I lightened it up a little by using turkey sausage. Next time I will not roast the eggplant ahead of time or roast it for far less time. After 30 minutes the eggplant was just about melted. I had to be very careful hollowing it out or I would have been easily left with only skin. Maybe next time I will roast for 15 minutes, then continue in the oven for 20 minutes. With some tweaking this is a nice recipe.

I made this recipe for dinner one night this summer for me and my boyfriend and we both loved it! I think I made it at least once a week all summer. I like to cook the sausage with a small chopped onion, and last time I added about a half cup of red cooking wine to the sausage while it cooked. It added another wonderful layer of flavor to the dish.

Really good only thing I will do next time is brush olive oil over all of the eggplant because it was a tad rubbery.

I chopped fresh mushrooms and sautéed them with the sausage.  Tastes good using Italian chicken sausage.  Will make again.  Had no problem removing the eggplant.  Using a small knife, I cut around the edge after the first stage of baking.  I gently ran the knife under the meat to loosen it from the bottom and then used a spoon to remove the eggplant meat.

Made this today for a late lunch/early supper.  Followed recipe exactly.  I've never cooked eggplant before and the only way I've eaten it was as eggplant parm.  This was easy to make and delicious.  We loved the flavors together and I will definitely make it again. Thanks for a great recipe!!

So, so wonderful.  I made enough for a small army - EVERYONE loved it.  I only wish I used a regular red meat sauce instead of a Vodka sauce, but will definitely make again!

Yum, yum, yum!  This is so very good!  I've made it twice now and have had no problem with scooping the flesh out of the shell once roasted.  We like it with ground spicy Italian sausage.  My 9 year old stepson gobbled it up and keeps asking me to make it again.  Thanks for a wonderful way to use all the eggplant that's in the garden.

This was really tasty.  It was a great way to eat some veggies.  We used turkey sausage and low-fat mozzarella cheese, so felt pretty good about the dish.  Thanks for sharing :)

This recipe is delicious! The flavors were so good together. I had trouble with the eggplant shell, so I threw the mixture in a casserole and topped with cheese and sauce. My kids and hubby loved it.

Very nice recipe! I used homemade venison sausage, which had a kick to it already, so I didn't need to add any extra spices. I also had to substitute monterey jack cheese for the mozzarella (what I had on hand). It turned out wonderfully. My 4- and 5-year-old loved it. The eggplant came out perfect. I will be making this easy dish again and again. Thanks for sharing.

Yummo!  I used hot italian turkey sausage, and added garlic and onion while frying it up.  Also used 2% mozz cheese.  My husband, who is not a big fan of eggplant, just loved it and asked me to add it to the dinner rotaion.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  It was a hot day and I didn't want to heat-up my kitchen so I made this on the grill.  It turned out really well.  I didn't have Italian sausage, so I substituted regular sausage and just added a little more Italian spices.

Very good!
I want to thank Bob Maronefor his comment. Although his comment was submitted it remains so very very true.
And for those of you freaking out because one serving in more than 800calories, what planet are you living on??
Have you never seen a recipe that is, say maybe, 1200 calories? The entire world is not on a constant low-calorie diet. And once on a while some good Italian sausage is worth the extra calories—that day, not every day! 
Even on Every diet plan there is expected an day or two of not following plan, that’s part of being human.
So anyway, Enjoy this! It is worth the extra calories (and fat, and salt, and it all). Enjoy!

My husband loves eggplant, so I wanted to try this.  I made it like the recipe says except that one of the eggplants that I'd gotten was spoiled inside, so I had too much filling for the one eggplant I had left.  I just put all the filling into the one eggplant shell.  It was pretty good--you could taste the eggplant in the filling somewhat, but not a lot actually.  The eggplant shell was not very thick by the time it was scooped out, so there was not much eggplant flavor there either.  Don't know that I'd make it again.  Think I'll just try eggplant patties--I know my husband likes those.

I love eggplant, but my wife hates it, so when I make it I'm usually the only one who will eat it. Not with this recipe. It was so fantastic that she couldn't get over the fact that it was eggplant! Really, it tastes like an excellent Chicago deep dish pizza without the crust! And it only gets better the day after. Along with the original recipe, I sauted 1/2 onion and 1 lg clove garlic before adding the sausage. Then a pinch of basil, sage and oregano. I layered everything -- sauce, meat, a layer of sauted mushrooms and parmesian. Then nice big blobs of ricotta covered with mozzarella cheese. Then I mixed in 1/4 cup sauce with the remaining sausage, and topped it with parmesian. Baked for 25 minutes, then the last 5 minutes I added more mozzerella and baked until golden -- not burned. Fantastic. (I used a total of 3/4 cup of sauce since I don't like too much -- yum!)

I prepared the Sausage-Stuffed Eggplant on Valentine's Day for my husband.  I have recently been paralyzed from the waist down and this was my second meal I have prepared from scratch.  My husband had to buy the main ingredients.  It was so good that someone where my husband works even asked for the recipe and I have connected her to your e-mail address.  Thank you.  May

Awesome recipe.  There are so many ways you can play with this and make it healthy or what have you.  I like using italian turkey sausage mixed with the roasted eggplant and layering it with polenta in a baking dish.  And there are spaghetti sauces that aren't riddled with chemicals, you have to look at the labels though.

I made the dish, however, I encountered the following problems:
1.  It was hard to remove the eggplant from the skin without penetrating it.  I even used a knife
2. Seemed like the eggplant was rather rubbery
3.  Therefore it was hard to chop.
Any suggestions as my husband really liked it.

awesome!  who would have ever thought to stuff an eggplant!  This was sooo tasty, my husband loved it too.  
I substituted breakfast sausage for the italian sausage cause that's what I had handy.  I also added a clove of garlic to the stuffing and diced onions/peppers.  Delicious!

We don't eat eggplant often but this was delicious, I added some extra garlic because we like it. The Italian sausage added so much flavor which is what a good dish is all about. We had a side of wide egg noodles with pasta sauce to go with it. Very tasty.

Thought it was okay, but will try making again bkz I had used baby eggplants which had too many seeds.  Definitely should add green pepper and onion to the sausage. Don't forget to score the eggplant inside so it'll scoop out easier after baking.

Delicious!!  And easy as well - I needed a recipe other than eggplant parmesan to use up my eggplant and this one was perfect.  Plus, you don't have to use the sausage - you could make it with hamburger as well or really add anything you want to the filling.  We made it exactly to the recipe's specifications and it was great - thank you!!

Easy, delicious, I make my own sausage, and YES I use sausage(news flash: YOU will not get out of this world alive...so ENJOY the time you have!) This is hands down my favorite eggplant recipe. Even those who turn up their nose at eggplant enjoy this dish! I don't change a thing, no need as it is delicious just the way it is written!

Wow! What a great different recipe for eggplant! Made pretty much as recipe called but skipped the bread crumbs to keep the carbs lower. See no need for bread crumbs in this but I'm sure it would be good with them too. Only gave four stars bcz it's not a quick and easy recipe, having to pre roast the eggplant etc

This was wonderful! The only change I made was adding about 1/2 cup of chopped onion to the sausage. My husband suggested adding a few mushrooms next time, so we might try that, as well.

This was really good. I tried to save on calories with omitting the chesse in the mixture and just added some on top of the eggplant under some additional spaghetti sauce. This recipe was a great way to use some fresh eggplant from my husband's garden. Really good.

Delicious!  I used ground beef just because I didn't want to make a special trip for sausage.  Added just a bit more of the seasonings to help the bland beef.  The whole family enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the first time I ever brought, cook, and ate eggplant and I loved it.  I cut the eggplant wrong (not paying attention to the directions) & was suprised to see the seeds. I had to google to make sure it was okay to leave the sides in.  I made it work with the pieces that I cut and it still turned out great.  I am cutting back on carbs so I tried this recipe. Now I will try to make eggplant french fries.

This was quite good ! Never ate or cooked eggplant before so I had no expectations. I did substitute low-fat  cheese (and much less of it) and used Italian turkey sausage vs. the real thing - I figure this cut the calories in half! I will make this again and follow the advice of others and add onion and perhaps a little more seasoning.

What a good way to cook eggplant!  I used ground turkey instead of sausage because it's what I had on hand.  I'm a garlic lover, so I seasoned the meat liberally.  So tasty.  So glad I found this recipe.

Fine.  Won't make again.  The eggplant added nothing to this recipe but a glamorized bowl.  I would have liked some pasta with my sausage sauce.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out to be a disaster.  Cooking the eggplant for so long at such a high temp. turned it into mush.  The insides were soft and goopy and the shell was no longer a shell; just a soft floopy skin casing.

Very good.  The eggplant skin fell apart so I wound up finishing it in a corning ware pan. We are having it again tonight.

I have made this 3 times in two weeks!!  Once for myself, and then I had to have friends over to share.  It's fabulous. tip - for one person - make whole recipe but cook one and refrigerate the other for the next days dinner - perfect.

Yikes - I know I am not the norm with how people like this but for us it was a huge bust and I am no slouch in the kitchen.   Guess it just wasn't for us!

Excellent, Excellent.  A new way to eat eggplant.  And because my husband & I are watching our weight, I used turkey sausage, substituted stewed tomatoes for the spagetti sauce and used a little asiago cheese.  And all of my recipes have red pepper, onion and fresh garlic.  Thanks for a really great recipe.

Excellent...I'm not one for grilled or roasted eggplant but this was so awesome, and the flavors were so well blended nothing over powered anything else yet all the flavors came through...I'd love to make as a casserole so I can make for a pot luck or a luncheon....I'll let you know how it turns out....Yumm!!!

Nice, very easy. My daughter doesn't care for eggplant, but she loved the filling. I added about a tablespoon of minced garlic and quite a bit more Italian seasoning (I used basil, oregano, thyme, and marjoram, totalling about 1 teaspoon) and still thought it could have used more. Also used gluten-free breadcrumbs. Next time, I'll put the filling over white rice for my daughter.

This turned out better than I had hoped. I added grated zucchini that I had sauted with garlic and used jack/cheddar cheese. My hubby who doesn't like eggplant loved it.  A keeper!

Although the kids still don't love eggplant, they like this better than eggplant parmsan. My changes include: only used 1/4 pound sausage and added 1 large shallot that I sauted when browning the sausage, crushed fennel seeds, pinch of cayenne. I pulsed everything in my chopper to hide chunks too.

The whole family loved it.  I used part ground sausage and part ground beef.  I also added chopped onions, peppers, and minced garlic to the sauteed meat.  We're trying to reduce our bread intake and didn't use breadcrumbs, it was fine without the breadcrumbs.

I gave this delightful dish the highest marks mainly because of the incredible blend of flavors and texture.  I prepared this last night following the recipe to the letter and was pleased with the results.  I did find handling the product somewhat cumbersome.  The next time I try this I will use individual gratin dishes for main course servings or ramekins to serve this as an appetizers spread with crostini.  The variations and applications are exciting.

This was excellent!  I added onion, green pepper, and garlic while the meat was browning and parmesan and red pepper flakes once it had finished.  The flavor was exquisite.  I served it to a group of 6, none of whom thought they liked eggplant, and they all LOVED it.  Also, I noticed afterwards someone said you needed to seed the eggplant.  I did not and it was fine

Thanks for the great recipe. I probably would have given it 5 stars if I had followed the recipe. I made the healthy version. I did as some of the other reviewers and used the low fat cheese. I did sub the sausage with ground turkey and seasoned it with garlic salt, red pepper and cayane pepper. I also sauteed a bit of red onion and red peppers with the turkey. It was very good. My husband loved it and ate half of the dish himself. My 4 year-old son had 2 helpings. To me it was lacking some spice in the meat.....which is my fault not the recipes.

If you like eggplant and Italian food, you will love this dish.  It was so tasty.  Good thing I doubled the recipe so I could have leftovers.  Wish I could pass it off as my own creation.  I'm very discriminating and will serve this to company, even without the added sauce at the end.  Thanks so much, Tanya.

Followed original recipe, only thing I did was made corrections on the amount of ingredients because the Eggplants that I purchased was HUGE.  This dish was delish,  when my friends tried it out they could not believe I made it.

I followed the recipe exactly and the family really liked it.  I gave it four stars because I think the size of the eggplant matters…the smaller the better: less seeds, less stringy pulp, resulting in less roasting time.

Delicious.  Used Panko because I didn't have any bread crumbs, but this probably didn't make too much of a difference.  I'm thinking baking times vary depending on the size of your eggplant.  My were medium sized and the baking time was perfect.  Although practically all the flesh came out of the skin, there was no way to leave 1/4 inch behind which suited me just fine.

THIS WAS A COMEDY OF ERRORS.  DIDN'T HAVE SAUSAGE SO I USED GROUND MEAT  THEY DIDN'T HAVE REGULAR EGGPLANT SO I GOT CHINESE EGGPLANT.  I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS AND STILL WITH EVERYTHING GOING WRONG, IT WAS DELICIOUS.  AND AGAIN THEY WENT FOR SECONDS AND TOOK IT FOR LUNCH.

We will definitely make this often !

I think the eggplant could have cooked longer.  It was hard to get out of the shell....  It takes too long for a weeknight.  It was good, but not delicious....

Yummy...… I didn't really deviate too much from the recipe.  I used my garlic infused olive oil on the eggplant and coated it with more garlic.  I cooked the sausage (actually used bratwurst) with garlic and onion.  I'll definitely make this again.

I found that the eggplant was too soft and therefore not easy to dice. Tried less time and lowered oven temp to 350 but still not easy to Duce. The end product was delicious but messy.

The eggplant was too runny and very little "meat" left after roasting.  As such, the entire product was too runny/wet, even with added breadcrumbs.   There was not enough eggplant taste and thus, in my mind, not worth effort.

I  gave it ?because apparently I don't like eggplant. I followed the recipe closely, added more sauce and was super excited to try something new.
The sausage mix was yummy but I will probably use in zucchini instead.

Scrumptious! I made some angel hair pasta tossed with garlic sautéed in olive oil to go along with the eggplant. We also had a tossed salad and slices of garlic toast. EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!

Regarding the relative healthfulness of this recipe, that depends on your idea of healthfulness. In my opinion the most healthful ingredient here is the sausage. The eggplant is an unhealthy (but delicious) indulgence for me, and one that I partake of sparingly. Also, the breadcrumbs and Ragu sauce should be omitted. Substitute a mixture of Parmesan cheese, almond flour and Italian seasonings for the bread crumbs . I also added Avocado oil, butter and some lard for additional good fats. Delicious and very healthful.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! It was so good and flavorful! Instead of using all Italian sausage I used half Italian sausage that was mild and half ground turkey. Instead of using breadcrumbs are used coaches oats. Those are the only changes I made and it was absolutely fantastic.

Its really a 1.5 out of 5 on the account I could barely eat it but I was too hungry and hate wasting, luckily I had hot sauce. The bread crumbs in the recipe should not exist. I used less and its all I could taste.

Delicious! Took a bit of time, but it was the first time I made it. . I suppose one could do all the steps up to stuffing the eggplant one day, refrigerate for later and then bake if time is an issue,

Omg! This was amazing! The only negative I have found is I have not worked out what to do with the excess spaghetti sauce (I make my own fresh each time) so it turns into a bake with stuffed aubergines in the middle. Unfortunately at this time of year it's difficult to find the extra big aubergines which would help my problem.

Did as was suggested by cutting around the eggplant before spooning out, made it easy.  Cooked eggplant with mixings less on second round and watched closely for perfection of cooking time.  Excellent taste and textures.  Will be making this many times.  Definately a family favorite, absolutely no leftovers this time.

Very good. Like others I added onion to the sausage in the skillet. The eggplant I had was small so had to try to adjust measurements to scale. Husband and I really liked it. Next time thinking I'll add more veggies to it like green peppers and mushrooms.

This is one of my favorite recipes and I make it regularly. While it may have come from a restaurant's appetizer menu, I serve it as an entree with a side salad. It serves four--unless you have a big eater like my husband in your house. Then it serves three. I can't always find bulk sausage in my local grocery store, so I just buy regular sausage and remove the casings.  We love spicy food, so I usually buy hot Italian sausage. Also, to increase the protein in the recipe, I use a full pound of sausage. Therefore, my eggplant has to weigh no less than 1 1/2 pounds, and even then it's overstuffed. If I can't find an eggplant that large, I'll buy two smaller eggplants and just have four halves instead of two. I use fresh mozzarella and shred it myself. It's an extra step, but it tastes so much better than the pre-shredded stuff.  For reviewers who complain this is an "unhealthy" recipe, I would like to point out that--while this is not a low fat recipe-- it is high in protein and low in carbs. Nevertheless, if you want to shave off some fat and calories, you can use no sugar added sauce, reduced fat cheese, and 93% lean ground beef or ground poultry instead of sausage. If you choose the latter, just make sure to season the protein well or your dish will be very bland. As for me, I go full-on with this recipe. Everything in moderation!

Great recipe! I have been experimenting with eggplant, since they grow so easily and one plant can give you a ton of fruit, if it's planted in a good spot. Anyhow, this recipe is very flexible - I didn't have Italian sausage, just some leftover homemade sauce without a lot of meat in it. I sauteed chopped Vidalia onion, sliced portabello mushrooms, and chopped green pepper, and added some cooked brown rice in order to replace the sausage. I followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out great! 

I am looking forward to using Italian sausage in it next time, although I like the rice so much that I will probably continue to include that as well. Thanks for a delicious addition to my summer eggplant repertoire!

Made it today for me and my hubby and we absolutely love it!  The only thing I changed was adding some parmesan cheese in addition to the mozarella.  I also made a small side of angel hair pasta and served it with the leftover sauce in addition to a side salad.  My husband loves my eggplant parmesan, but he said he loved this recipe even more!  Easy recipe and I definitely will be making it again very soon!

Hi all. I have made this several times and my friends have made request for more. The very first time I created this I went by the original recipe and just left out the last layer of mozzarella cheese. Too cheesy!  Honestly I'm a boy from Brooklyn. There was never enough Italian food. I'm not Italian but have lived the life!  This dish was requested for my friends giving celebration so I made two trays and left the eggplant shell out.

First  off,  i'll make it again! I made one small substitution. Instead of Italian sausage, I used venison. It was fantastic. I served with a kale cabbage salad &  balsamic vinegarette dressing. 
 Don't be fooled… Half an eggplant is filling!

Quick, easy and delicious!  Substituted ground turkey for the sausage, added onions and seasoned to taste while browning.  Will definitely be a frequent addition to my menu.

This was AMAZING!!!! I used two med. sized eggplants and three Italian sausage links that I had made . I knew that the sausages were really spicy so I didn't add the additional spices. I scored the eggplants and cooked them for 20 mins @350. They came out of the skin fairly easily, once cooled,  using a grapefruit spoon. I browned the meat per instructions but added an onion and a large clove of garlic, one can never have too much onion and garlic. I also added diced mushrooms that needed to be used up. Because of dietary restrictions I didn't top with cheese. My husband, who is usually fairly quiet while eating, kept say "this is really good". The pasta sauce was a simple marinara that I made the day before so the flavours would meld. Top notch recipe that I know will be requested again and again. Thanks so much Tanya, I would give this recipe ten stars if I could.

We absolutely loved this one!  I think this is our new favorite eggplant recipe.  It was very easy to make, and tasted great.  I used Bertolli's Vodka Sauce as the pasta sauce, and it didn't overpower at all.  I misread the ingredients and used regular bulk sausage, not Italian, but it was still wonderful.

The only issue we had was that the skin seemed to get a little tough.  I didn't mind it, but hubby is going to just avoid it next time.

LOVED IT. I did make 1 mistake. After I grilled the eggplant and sausage (for extra flavor), I scooped out the eggplant, combined all the ingredients as stated and stuffed it into large prebaked Portobello mushroom caps coated in EVOO and lightly salted. I somehow forgot about the eggplant "boats". It was to die for. I had so much filling left after piling two caps full, that I made the same dish the next night using 6 slightly smaller caps. I found that the caps are so dense where the stem is removed, I chose to slice shallow slits at the thickest part so they would bake evenly. Please try this small change of using the caps vs the eggplant shells. No waste.

So, I tried this recipe tonight for dinner. Very easy, minimal labor and dishes.  When I make a recipe for the first time I don't change anything - that way I can give it a true critique. However, the cook times for me were what screwed it up. I had to cut the first baking time down to 20 minutes b/c my eggplant was getting very brown on top. I cut the second bake time down to 25 - any longer and my cheese would've really burned. I probably should've have taken it out sooner but I didn't think to check it. Knowing what I know now I would wait and start cooking the sausage after the eggplant has cooked for the first time. That way your eggplant is cooling while your getting the rest of the prepping done. Otherwise good flavors, but I don't think I'd make again.

I've never made anything with eggplant before and was ready to pitch this after assembling ('cause it looked weird to me) but after having it for dinner we're really glad I didn't. I used one pound of country sausage, but wish I'd stuck with the 1/2 lb. as the recipe calls for, and didn't use an egg. It was moist enough that we didn't need the extra sauce and was still very happy with the taste of the dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was so yum! I made it for two people who have never had eggplant before and were pretty skeptical. They loved it so much! And have since made it for themselves. I follwed the recipe pretty much exactly. I used spicy Italian sausage with cheese and changed the herb mixture a little. 5 Stars!

I, like other reviewers, had a little trouble getting the meat of the eggplant out and leaving enough shell, but it was still delicious!  I had a little bit of the stuffing left over to make a wrap with some goat cheese the next day.

I had never tried baked eggplant before and the taste was great.  The only thing was I found the end result a bit mushy.  Maybe if the final "bake" in the oven were shortened it would help this.  Overall a very nice recipe.

I made this last night, it was very good. I used italian sausages, took out of the casings and cooked in a skillet until browned, added all other ingredients and stuffed into pre-baked eggplant. The only thing I did not like was after hollowing out the eggplant ,there  were so many seeds. Baked it for 30 mins more and it was delicious.

I followed the recipe as closely as I could; used turkey sausage instead of pork and a mozzarella/provolone blend (it was what I had), but other than that, I didn't change much.  I hollowed my eggplants to a 1/4 inch thickness instead of 1/2 inch thickness, because I've had trouble with the eggplants cooking thoroughly in stuffed eggplant dishes before, and this worked well.  I would have liked one more ingredient in the stuffing, since it was a bit sausage-heavy and the eggplant kind of got lost; then again, it's "Sausage-Stuffed Eggplant," not "Sausage-And-Some-Other-Stuff-Stuffed Eggplant."  A little on the heavy side, but tasty and super easy!  If I'd planned a little better, it would have been fast, too; roasting the eggplant and browning the sausage ahead would have definitely cut down on the evening prep time.

Fantastic.  I have made this twice now. The first time exactly as written and the results were phenomenal.  The second time I added onion and some chopped boiled shrimp that I had left over from a previous dinner.  Each time it was terrific. Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe.

I love eggplant to decided to give this a try.  It turned out pretty well, but I did make a couple of changes.  I swapped out the mozzarella in the sausage mixture for a few tablespoons of parmesan.  I also did not use the egg. Next time I might consider salting and draining the eggplant for about half an hour to get rid of some of the bitter juices, and might try regular ground beef.

I thought I hated eggplant- until I tried this. Fabulous. Makes for a very impressive presentation too.

Loved this recipe.  My mom made a similar dish for us when I was a child.  She used zucchini squash from her garden instead of eggplant.  Husband is not an eggplant fan, but he said I should make this again.

Ok, so had an eggplant that needed to be used, and thought I had usable sausage, alas I did not, so I changed this recipe up A LOT, but I like how it turned out.  I used sliced turkey instead of sausage, used stuffing crumbs instead of just plain bread crumbs, used some leftover oil/vinegar with lots of italian spices that was part of a cold tortellini salad as the "egg"  -- used tomato paste because I didn't have spaghetti sauce, added sliced red onions and baby spinach, grated cheese to the mix, then did slices of pesto jack on top.  sounds like a mess, but it turned out wonderful.  I never seem to follow recipes, but it usually turns out good, if not better than the original.

i doubled this recipe and used my own sauce, and they were awesome.  if i had to use store bought sauce, they would have been just as good.  i made the mistake of mixing the mozzarella into the mixture before stuffing, so i sprinkled some parm on the top with an additonal bit of sauce.  i will make these again hopefully when my crop of eggplants come in this summer.  thanks for the post Tanya.

This was a good recipe. I added chopped cilantro and green onions.  It didn't take me 30 minutes for the second time baking since the cheese were already browning by 20 minutes or so.  I must have a hot oven.  Anyhow, good stuff.

This is great! I think with all recipes you have to adapt to what you like/eat.  I used turkey sausage - spicy and it was awesome.  I also left out the bread crumbs and egg.  And since I am light on sauce I didn't serve extra sauce.  Veggie sausage, turkey sausage, meatballs, etc...all will work great!  Even veggies I think!  This will be awesome come summer with fresh homegrown eggplant and homegrown tomatoes instead of the sauce - and on the grill!!  Yum!  My kids even liked this!

I didn't care too much for this although my husband said it was good.  The eggplant turned really mushy and grey and was gross to look at.  But to be honest I had never cooked it before so maybe that is how eggplant is supposed to be???  Anyway, I used spicy sausage which really added some nice flavor.  I think if I had used regular italian sausage it would have been inedible.

Delicious - used half hot italian sausage and half sweet italian sausage - doubled the spices and added some oregano.
