We made these for GS World Thinking Day to represent a food item from Russia. (Non-alcoholic of course.) I will admit that most of it ended up in the trash, but I think that was more of an indication of 5-10 year olds being the major age group present at the event. We did have several people like it, my family certainly did. I ended up using sliced beets instead of baby since the only baby beets I could find were pickled. This will be going on our family make again list. Delicious!

Made this recipe exactly how it was written except I used sliced beets-my store didn’t carry baby beets. I was hoping that based on the title the final result would not be as sweet as beets can be. However, we didn’t taste any “sour.”  We won’t be making this again, but it was very simple and fast to make and as long as you like the sweet taste of beets, you will probably enjoy the recipe.

Delicious!  These will be a dinner party soup course staple at the LTH house.  I love that they are makeaheadable and delicious, to boot. I enjoy the shooter presentation and am looking forward to trying the next round w/a little vodka.  THANKS for the recipe, Lillian Julow!
