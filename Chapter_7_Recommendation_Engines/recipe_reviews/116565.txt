I thought this recipe was great - and the guys agreed. The marinade sauce was too thick for me so I added a combination of the liquids called for to loosen it up and marinated my sirloin all day. I broiled my skewers for about 12 minutes total. Cooked perfectly. I added ginger, lime, and red pepper flakes to the reserved marinade for a dipping sauce. Thanks for the recipe!!

I love beef (especially grilled!) and I love anything peanuty thai, so when I found this recipe I was very excited! It was phenomenal. The beef was so moist and rich, even for a couple days after. The only thing I did different was put all of the peanut sauce in the bag with the meat, and made sure the pieces were heavy coated when they came out and went on the skewers. I also served it with homemade thai peanut sauce for some extra fun!

We really enjoyed these !  I only had about 2 hours to let them marinate, so I think next time I'll let them sit overnite to really let the peanutty goodness set in.  One small variation, I added a about a tablespoon of rice vineager to soften the mixture up a bit.

OMG!!.  These are terrific.  I do agree that extra marinade would make an amazing dipping sauce at the table as the meat does dry out naturally a bit.  very delicious, and easy!

Easy and tasty.  My wife has a marinated flank steak recipe that we cook often, so we used this to pair it with and used flank steak rather than sirloin.  The two flavors complemented each other well.  Both were a hit with our guests.  Cooked on a big green egg...

We used moose meat and the boy loved it!  I ate mine as they were, and the boy put his on a sandwich roll.  Good times and he's already asked that I make them again!

This was a great recipe, and my guests really loved it.  I also made a simpler version of the marinade for some vegetable skewers that I served with this dish.  Next time, I am going to use the extra marinade and create a sauce to go with the beef skewers, because the beef was a little dry for my liking.  I recommend this recipe!

I LOVED the sauce, but i thought it lost some of the (AWESOME) flavor once grilled.... so i just save some until the end, then either smother them while they're on the sticks, or I put it out for dippin'

There was not a lot of peanut taste to these - we had them some time ago and I'm just catching up on reviews.  No one has requested them since we had them so didn't really stand out in anyone's mind. Not a keeper, sorry!

This peanut sauce is truly AMAZING.  I'd give it 10 stars if a could!  Make sure you make a double batch so you have plenty for dipping.  Also is fantastic on chicken.

I used the reserved marinade as a dip instead of basting the skewers.  My husband loved it.  He even let me use the grill.

I need to start this with I COULD NOT GIVE THIS ENOUGH STARS!!!  It deserves at least 10.  That being said...I saw this recipe a few years ago and finally got around to trying it.  I really wish I hadn't waited, it was soooooo amazingly good!!!!!  I used chunky peanut butter and added a little bit of fresh minced ginger, but otherwise followed the marinade to a tee.  However, I marinated single small steaks and not cubes.  I did have to pan cook the beef as it was raining out and I didn't want to get wet grilling.  This became an instant favorite and it was so simple to make.  Everyone needs to try this.  Everyone!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was since I didn't have any lemon juice I substituted with orange juice.  It was still delicious!  I also added sprinkled some red pepper on top for heat.  It went really well with white rice with some fresh green pepper on top for color and taste.

This recipe was o.k. but it had a hint of flavor I thought was strange. If I made it again I would try different spices.
