Disclaimer: I made 2 substitutions - 1) used baby spinach because I had it and it was mid morning on a Sunday and I hadn’t eaten and didn’t want to run out 2) Eggbeaters instead of the 2 whole eggs because of my high cholesterol.

It is delicious! I used to make a ‘pie’ with spinach and cheese and bisquick that was great but lots of carbs. This took the carbs out, but the cauliflower gave it body and substance. 

It is a great base recipe to experiment with - add extra veggies, add cheese etc. 

Will make again very soon!

I didn’t make any changes. I would have preferred more yolk and less egg white but made as the recipe called for, it was delicious. Would make again.
