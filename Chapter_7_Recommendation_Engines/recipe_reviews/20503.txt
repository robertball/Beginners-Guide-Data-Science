I have made this recipe several times before finding it on the site.  I love it.  I do add one small can of diced green chiles and omit the almonds since my husband is allergic.  It is a great recipe.  Don't be afraid to add some garlic...just don't be surprised if your spouse asks you to sleep on the couch that night, haha.

used this for a party and someone else also brought a different artichoke dip.  This one was all gone and the other remained!  The mozarella cheese does it.

This was very good.  I did add a little bit of cream cheese and did not add the almonds.  It turned out nicely.  I would make again (with my addition).  Thanks for the post.

have made this for many, many gatherings and parties and it's always a hit. VERY EASY and quick. Make sure to DRAIN the artichokes or the dip will become too oily. You can even rinse and pat them dry and the marinade will still remain. Topped with chopped walnuts is good too!

Delicious!  Keep it warm or eat it quickly.  Otherwise you will have a lumpy funny looking dish on your hands.

Pretty good, but not a whole lot of flavor... needs salt for sure!  But also, I think next time I'll put some roasted garlic in it.

This stuff is the bomb!  It is a favorite with wine for my husband and I on movie nights!  I substitute 2 cups of italian 6 cheese blend and 1 cup of grated Asiago.  (you can find these at Publix).  We also add some sun-dried tomatoes (in oil). We serve this with bread.  We usually get french bread and toast the slices before we serve!  This goes great with wine!

So easy.  As easy as it was, it was equally that good.  The dip got rave reviews from everyone!  I did add sliced almonds on top before baking.

This dip goes quickly because it is so good.  I've been making this for years, with several variations.  The key is to use good parmesan cheese.  I like Trader Joes freshly grated parmesan.  Sometimes I add chilies or sun dried tomato for a little kick, and I always add fresh garlic.

This recipe was fantastic!  For some kick I added a can of diced jalapenos.  Rather than serve it as an appetizer I made open-faced sandwiches with it.  I broiled some sliced ciabbiatta bread then layered on the dip, peppered shredded chicken, and mozzarella cheese before broiling the cheese to a nice bubbly brown.  I added a slice of tomato to the top and sprinkled with dried parsley for some color.  It was a HUGE HUGE delicious hit!!

The first time I ever made an artichoke dip was for Christmas Eve 2009.  My family loved it.  The almonds on top were a tasty addition.  We will serve this dip again for sure; it will become a holiday tradition.

I use frozen artichoke hearts, because they have a more solid texture. I have made this with all kids of cheeses, Mexican blend, Asiago and Parmesan. I have also used sour cream and mayo together. Don't be afraid to experiment with this recipe.

I had a taste test at my office and this came out the winner--hands down!  We served it at a party and I had more requests for the recipe than any other recipe I have ever had and that says it all.  I tried it with lowfat Mayo and low fat cream cheese on New Year's and felt it was even better--Less oil allowed for more taste for our liking.

I suggest using fresh peppers and roasting them yourself, but either way, this was a wonderful dish.  I'm not usually an artichoke fan but this made it really great.  You won't be dissapointed.

This was an excellent dip!  I made very few changes.  First I made sure that I rinsed some of the marinate off of the artichokes.  I then added some jalapenos and hot sauce.  So good!  I made it for a party this weekend and it was gone in 10 minutes.

I make this every time we have company and it doesn't last 30 minutes.  I like to serve it with blue or multigrain tortilla chips.  I cut back the mayo by 1/3 and replace it with full fat sour cream which prevents lots of oil from building up on top.

This was great dip, but I did make a few adjustments.  I added roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, salt, pepper, and about 1/4 cup of cream.  Oh, I also added a few drops of tabasco to give it a bit of a kick.  It was gone in no time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't have marinated artichokes in my cupboard so instead I used regular canned ones and added garlic to the recipe.  I baked it and then served it in a bread bowl with garlic bagel chips on the side.  I wish that I had read all the reviews b/f I made it b/c I didn't keep it warm.  But, that didn't stop people.  I served it at a baby shower and it was a huge hit.  And one big bonus?  Once the dip was gone, the bread in the bowl was greasy and cheesy and garlicy :-)  Mmmmmmm...healthy :-)

Made this (without the almonds) for my husband's birthday--it was awesome! I was looking for an artichoke dip that didn't have spinach b/c I hate working with frozen spinach, and one that was super cheesy, and this fit the bill! delicious!

I found this recipe about 3 years ago and I first used it on Christmas Eve and it was an instant big hit! Everyone loved and I am now required to make it at every dinner event we have at our house. I added extra mozzarella cheese to make it more cheesey - but in all honesty, this recipe doesn't need any adjustments at all! *side note - I did not put any almonds in it*

I add a can of diced green peppers and broil last 5 minutes after I put the almonds on. It is now a favorite in our family!!!

This had a very mild taste.  However, my 9 year old loved it.     And, the plate was licked clean!  Next time I'll try adding some cayenne and garlic.

I have made this on numerous occasions and it’s always come out fantastic! Although I did make a couple of small changes which I think significantly helped. Instead of mozzarella I substituted sharp cheddar and then I added some blue cheese for some tang!!

This is a good dip for parties.  I do like to put fire-roasted diced green chilis for that extra flavor.

When I made this recipe, it tasted very bitter!  It must have been the marinated artichokes or the brand that I used.  Next time, I will use regular artichokes, so I'm willing to give it another try.

This one sounded great, but was kind of dry and not too much flavor.  Won't use again.

I brought this to a party and EVERYONE loved it.  I thought the almonds added a great texture and taste.  I used more artichokes than called for as I like less mayo and more artichoke.  I am making it again right now to bring to another shindig!  Thanks.

I'm still searching for a recipe like TGIF- this is just too greasy for me. It's good- just not what I'm looking for.

This dip is outrageous!  It's now become a family favorite, requested for every get-together.  Creamy, tangy, cheesy!  It's also pretty good cold, the next day (if there's any left for the next day).
