Nice and "simple"...perfect for children to assemble. The pepper is a mild variety, only 2 more ingredients. I enjoyed it and I think they will, too! Especially since they made it!

These were very good and so simple! I used fresh banana peppers from the garden which were not at all uniform in size. Next time I'll chop up the salami, mix it into cream cheese and then pipe it into peppers. Yum Yum!!

These were a big hit at my get together.  Very easy to prepare and the flavor was excellent.  I added some finely chopped scallion but I think it would have been just as good without it.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Really tasty recipe that my wife and I have made several times in the last month or two. Rather than using a jar of banana peppers, we've been using the bumper crop of hot banana peppers from our garden. I think the fresh peppers give it a nice crunch. And so simple!

Our crowd loves Jalapenos, so we modified this with Speck (smoked prosciutto) and stuffed the cheese and Speck into Jalapenos.  Also, I processed some of the Speck with the cheese and lightly seasoned with Cajun seasoning, to give more depth of ham flavor. 

We then smoked the peppers at 300 on the BGE until totally caramelized on outside.

The beauty is the simplicity of stuffing John's way!

Simple yet excellent...

Thanks john!

It was easy and very good.  The second time I made it with pancetta instead of salami, less salty and just as delicious!! This recipe is a keeper.

So easy and so good. Used fresh yellow banana peppers and jalepenos from the garden and wrapped with different antipasta. Delicious. Oh, and I stuffed a pattypan squash too and it was delicious as well.

I really liked these. I roasted my peppers on the grill before stuffing and putting in the oven. You just have to be sure your salami is sliced thin so it rolls easily.

Amazing! So simple to make. Also tried with pepperoni. Works with that too. I only leave them in the oven for about 20 minutes though. Thanks for the great snack!

I harvested 6 banana peppers from our garden for this dish.  I sauteed some onion and zucchini (also from our garden) and added them to the cream cheese spread.  It was fantastic!

Made this for a New Year's Eve party, exactly as written.  It was fine but didn't really get any special compliments.  Sorry I can't give it more than a 4.
