I would make it again.  I am a novice baker.  When I started I thought I has a 15x10x1 pan.  Not.  I had to use a 17x12x1.  It work.  I may have not got the number of servings as I should.  But no-one is going to complain about a bigger serving.  To get the icing spreadable, I had to increase the milk amount 1/3 cup.  I layered the scrap cake and leftover icing in a plastic container and froze it.  I will see how in taste in a month.  Next time I will cut into rectangles for less waste.
