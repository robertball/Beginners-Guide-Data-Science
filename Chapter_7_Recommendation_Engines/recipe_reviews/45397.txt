I made a few changes but what an easy and comforting dish!  I used my crockpot and just loaded it full of sliced apples ( I think I used 8-10), peels on, mixed in the other ingredients and then added about 1/4 cup of apple cider in place of the milk.  I figured the 1/2 cup might be too much!  I put it on high and in a few hours I had a fantastic dessert that the whole family loved!  We ate it warm with some cool whip on top, since I didn't have any ice cream!  I will make this again!

I followed the recipe's ingredients exactly, and the results were delicious! After peeling and cutting the apples, I put them in a large ziploc bag, added the spices, and shook the bag to coat the apples. This worked very well! I then added the remainder of the ingredients and shook them together before pouring them into the baking dish. It was super easy, and the apples were evenly coated!

I'm just 13 and i absolutely love to cook and bake. My family went apple picking this weekend and i wanted to make a dessert that was quick and sweet. I added some things to this recipe to make it even better. I sprinkled brown sugar on the apples before baking which gave them a gooey, sweeter coating and topped with granola. Sooo goood. Anybody can make this, please try it!

Pretty good!  I upped the amount of cinnamon, and left out the other spices.  I also omitted the raisins and nuts because I didn't have any on hand.  I also added 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract - which turned out great.  While baking, I covered it with foil to retain moisture, as other reviewers (Christy7795) suggested.  All in all, I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

My family really liked this recipe. I made just a couple of minor changes. I omitted the cloves, and added a few drops of vanilla extract to the milk before pouring it over the apples. I also put a few thin slices of stick butter on top of the apple mixture right before I put it in the oven. It turned out great! I'm sure I'll make this one again.

Absolutely YUMMY! Made it with Splenda in place of the sugar because I'm diabetic and my daughter is always on a diet. Used a handful of frozen cranberries for color and tart counterpoint. Makes a lovely dessert. This would be wonderful served hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream melting on top. It's a keeper!!

This is really good! It is so quick and easy to make. It is just like apple crisp without the topping. I didn't have raisins, but it was good with the walnuts. You could also use Craisins (dried cranberries); that would be good. I think next time I will also add some chopped sweet potato. This is great for anyone! Much easier than making apple crisp.

I didn't add raisins or walnuts and used skim milk, and they were still delicious.  I'll be making again and again.  Thanks!

Delicious with or without the walnuts.  Very easy to make and goes great with pork chops.

I used skim milk because it was all I had.  This would have been much better with the whole milk that it calls for.  I sprinkled brown sugar on top of them after they had baked and that added a lot!  It was good.  Make sure you use whole milk.:-)

This was ok.  Made it for my parents for a late Mother's Day dinner dessert...and it didn't turn out as well as I had expected.  I don't know what I could have done differently...it just didn't do it for us.  Thanks for the post anyway.

great as is because apple crisp is one of my fav things. trying to watch calories I want some of the flavor/texture without all the extra sugar/butter/flour or oats. Love Dutch Apple Pie but too sweet and dislike pastry crust. 1. As I prepped the apples I put in bowl with lemon juice (slow at this due to bad hands) 2. Used PURE maple sugar as it was in pantry.    Would use pure maple syrup/brown sugar otherwise. 3. Used BOILED CIDER (ditto--in cupboard) instead of milk. 4. Mixed dry ingr in big plastic bag, added apples (drained) and shook. 5. IMHO too sweet so sliced more apples and added more spices/raisins/nuts. 6. Poured into larger casserole dish and baked until barely tender--our preference. 7. Great warm, but soooo good over greek yogurt and oatmeal in the a.m.  I will def. make much more when friends help with the apple part!  Wonderfully easy and can modify as your taste desires. Hmmm, dress up french toast, accompany pork chops....heck, eat with a spoon!

I did this for Thanksgiving and got lots of compliments. I prepped the apples the night before with the sugar and seasonings and stored them in the fridge in zip lock bags. In the morning I put them in my crockpot with half milk, half apple cider on low. 4 hrs later they were fantastic. Served them as a stand alone dish with fresh made whip cream as a topping.

First of all this is a very good recipe but I made a couple of mistakes when I made it. Make sure to use apples that are considered baking apples. I used HoneyCrisps because they are our favorites and they were what I had. I also used one other apple that I was given and have no idea what kind it was. It had a mushier texture though. That apple was the only one that really sofened up while baking. The Honey Crisps remained a little crisp even after an hour in the oven. I used brown sugar in place of white, that was good. And craisins in place of raisins, also good. Unless you really love cloves, leave that out. I only used 1/4 tsp and it was still too much. Next time I'll stick with cinnamon and nutmeg only. I didn't have whole milk so I used 1/2 cup of half&half, that also worked ok. I ground the nuts a little too fine I think and I used pecans because it was also what I had. All in all this is an excellent recipe and I will be making it again. I'll just make sure I use the right kind of apples from now on, leave out the cloves and use pecan halves in place of grinding them. (I used the coarse grind but it was still too fine for my taste.) I did like this recipe though. It's like apple pie with out the crust.

Excellent and tasty! Many apple recipes seem off-putting, but this was not difficult to prepare at all. Used recipe proportions, minus the walnuts. To reduce prep time a bit more, I didn't peel my apples: I simply washed the fruit and then divided the apples with a combination tool that cores and sections in one step (each apple is divided into 8 wedges rather than thin slices). Mixed flour, sugar, spices in separate bowl and then mixed everything together in the 9-in glass pie dish I was going to bake in. I did add a few slices of butter on top as another reviewer suggested. I was afraid that the apples on top might dry out, but I baked it for an hour uncovered (checked the fruit for tenderness at 45 min) and it came out great! Soft but not mushy fruit infused with a balanced synergy of spices! Wholesome, delicious, and homemade—you can't go wrong!

Easy to do!  KEEP SKINS ON FOR COLOR!  I baked Rome apples at 375 for 20 mins covered with foil, then 350 for 20 mins, uncovered.  Left out cloves.  Used only 1/4 cup of Splenda, made it sweet enough.  Came out perfect and pretty!

Like Applie Pie without the fuss! I only used the milk, cinnamon,nutmeg, sugar, flour, and apples, and it still turned out awesome.

*I wanted to add that this turned out best when I mixed the milk with the dry ingredients and then poured all of the ingredients over the apples instead of doing it in steps.

Delicious!! I used organic sugar, omitted the flour(don't eat grains), left out the walnuts(had none), and used 2% milk. Everyone enjoyed it. The only problem I had with it was that it was too sweet for my tastes. No one else in my family thought so though. Next time I will either cut the sugar in half or just leave it out altogether and maybe use some honey instead. I will definitely make this again!! Loved it especially because after I omitted the flour it became the perfect grain-free treat. Thanks for sharing!!

These were delicious. I didn't use the raisins as my husband isn't a huge fan. I also used skim milk as opposed to whole, and I thought it tasted fine. I was going to have it with cool whip, but forgot to pick it up at the store. Instead, we had it with cinnamon ice cream. :) Will make again.

Very good.  I only used a small pinch of cloves, since I am not a fan of cloves. The only recommendation that I have is to cover the dish with foil while baking and remove it during the last 10 minutes or so.  I left mine uncovered and the apples were sort of dry, not nice and bubbly as I expected them to be.

Just took this out of the oven and gave a taste......Delicious!  I made it with 1/3 cup Splenda like another reviewer and instead of ground nutmeg and cloves, I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Also used Craisins instead of raisins.  Tastes like apple pie without the crust.  Can't wait to try it with a little whipped topping later.  Thank you for a great, easy recipe.

Great recipe!  The best part about it is how flexible it is--you can make it quite healthy if you want.  I subbed in a mixture of Splenda white and brown sugar (in a 1:2 ratio), replaced the nuts with dried cranberries, and used soy milk in place of regular milk.  I also scaled the recipe down considerably, for use with just two granny smith apples.  I popped it in the oven for exactly 45 minutes with foil over the dish (cutting holes in the top--I wonder if this matters??) and it came out perfect.  I can see this being a regular dessert!!

Simple, good and fairly healthy. I halved the sugar as I was using sweet apples. Might add a touch of brown sugar in the future. UPDATE: Made this again as I loved the flavors. Last time, I made this with almond milk as I can't have dairy. Made it again with light coconut milk. Plus, I added the full half a cup of sugar as indicated in the recipe. However, I just filled most of the half cup measuring  utensil with white sugar then packed on about two or three tablespoons of brown sugar. YUM! Cannot stop eating this delicious treat! Oh, and I also used 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch rather than the flour. It is a bit runny, but I think the sauce is what makes it great. Might go for 2 tablespoons cornstarch next time to see how it turns out.

We love these apples!  I use gluten free flour and almond milk, they turn out great.  Typically, I substitute Penzey's Pumpkin Pie Spice for the spices called for in the original recipe.  Will be serving these, along with a scoop of Dulce de Leche ice cream, to my Beloved for Valentine's Day tomorrow.   YUM!

What an amazing and relatively healthy dessert! I followed the recipe except for one thing - I put a teaspoon of vanilla extract into my milk. A nice touch indeed! I think this will be a staple in our household from now on.

I am going to give this 3 stars because I changed the recipe slightly.This may have been ok with all the sugar this calls for but we made it with much less sugar. We did not care for this at all with the flour - it gobbed on the apples and did not taste good. Additionally, the long bake time was just not worth it. We won't make this again.

Holy Cow this is good.  My family liked it even better than regular apple crisp.  The only thing I did differently is used 1/3C splenda and doubled the cinnamon, it was plenty sweet.  We had leftovers and I used it in my oatmeal--delicious.

I made this the other night, my husband and i enjoyed it very much, the only changes i made was i cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and i put brown sugar in it instead of white.
I loved the flavor of all the spices and we ate it warm out of the oven with yoghart on it.

Yum! These were the perfect complement to my fall meal. Because I was just serving myself (my hubs does not like fruit), I halved this. Now I have a sweet treat to enjoy the rest of the week! :) As with any new recipe I try, I made a few tweaks to suit my tastes. By mistake, I used the full amount of spice called for (oops!). I intentionally subbed maple sugar for plain sugar and apple pie spice for the individual spices simply because I had both on hand. I also added 1/2 t vanilla to my milk. My only suggestion for next time is to NOT cut my apple slices so thin. They got pretty limp. :( I think cutting into eighths or fourths (depending on the size of my apples) would work better. One more necessary change is omitting the walnuts alltogether. They seemed out of place and added nothing to this dish, IMHO. I'd double up on the raisins instead (on the contrary, they were the perfect complement). NOTE: Use baking apples for this. I used Golden delicious apples. Served with a dollop of whipped cream, this was a mildly sweet, somewhat healthy treat. Thanks for sharing, MAEVEN6! :-)

I used pecans instead of walnuts and cranberries instead of raisins.  Put it all in my little crockpot and cooked it on high for about an hour or so.  I knew it was done when the delicious apple pie smell filled my entire apartment!  So simple and delicious.  Maybe a little too sweet with both the sugar and dried fruit.  Will probably skill the sugar (I used two Stevia packets) all together.

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't think it was anything spectacular for family eating. It also wasn't very attractive to serve to guests. I will not use it again. I tried it twice to give it the benefit of the doubt as there were so many good reviews and I still won't make it again.

so yummy! I followed the  directions, except exchanging the sugar for 1/4 cup of Splenda, and dried cranberries for the raisins. I also added pears to the apples. Very Very good! I will make again!

Delish! Used apple cider instead of milk; I don't see how using milk would work, unless it was a nondairy version like almondmilk or ricemilk. I omitted the nutmeg and cloves (we don't really care for them) and just used 2 tsp cinnamon. Definitely bake these uncovered. They make a delicious, sticky syrup as they're baking. My favorite baked apple recipe. Thanks for the post!

Perfect recipe. Easy! I also added some pears to this recipe. Great if you're having company. After it's cooled you can reheat it in the microwave and put some icecream on top. Perfecto!

We loved this recipe so much I made again the next day.  I thought I could improve on a good thing so I used Bisquick mix instead of flour (about 1 cup, I eyeballed it I don't measure usually) and increased the milk to about 1 cup also. Omitted the nuts and combined about 3/4 cup of quick oats(oatmeal) to the dry ingredients. After 1 hour in the oven it came out awesome.  We will be eating this often! :)

I thought these were very good!  I didn't measure the walnuts and added dried cranberries as others suggested and I didn't have any raisins on hand.  I also covered my dish (as other suggested) and I found there was too much milk still left after cooking for 40 minutes.  I recommend covering for 1/2 the time, then uncovering to allow the milk to get evaporated a little bit.  Also, I forgot to grease my baking dish and didnt really have a hard time cleaning it, thankfully!  I will make these again.

I have to admit, I was drawn to this recipe while looking for something to salvage a few apples that were no longer at the peak for eating out of hand.  My sweetener of choice was brown sugar and I added more spice than called for and a touch of lemon juice.   The final result was just lovely - I was surprised and delighted.

This was amazing! I made it in the crockpot, per some other reviews, and because my oven was occupied with other food. I put all the ingredients (not raisins or walnuts) and used 1/4 cup apple cider instead of milk. I cooked it on high for about 2.5 hours and it was perfect withe vanilla ice cream.

Liked these a lot.  Put them in the slow cooker on low for about 1 1/2 hours; subbed apple juice for the milk, and omitted the raisins and walnuts.  I also subbed a bit of allspice for the cloves.  A little too sweet for breakfast or a side dish for me, but perfect for dessert.  May cut down on the sugar next time.

This was so good and so easy. I customized a little, I used a crock pot and didn't even add the raisins and walnuts. Instead of milk I used apple juice. I also substituted 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 cup white. After leaving it on low all day, the smell and consistency was amazing. I topped a piece of angel food cake with apples and cool-whip. Yum.

My six year old son and two year old daughter loved this. I used Stevia sugar instead of regular white sugar because it's healthier. I also diced the apples and when they came out of the oven I added them to Quaker Instant Oatmeal for a really delicious and healthy breakfast. Very easy recipe to follow. It also makes your house smell like apple pie.

This came out pretty terrible for me, but I think it's my fault. I tried to make it vegan by substituting turbinado sugar for white and almond milk for whole milk. The sugar didn't melt and get bubbly. The flavor was not delicious. Total kitchen failure. Hope you all have better luck.

I made these with our Christmas dinner. I made them accordingly but ommitted the raisins and walnuts. I added a few bits of butter and brown sugar on top as suggested by another reviewer. The apples turned out well enough but could have standed even a little more sugar. I found they tasted better the longer they sat. Also the recipe does not make 12 servings but more along the lines of 6-8. I'll make again with some modifications.

The milk does not work in this recipe because it curdles. With some modifications we enjoyed this. Use apple cider instead of milk, didn't use cloves or walnuts and replaces raisins with craisins.

This was very, very good.  I am giving it only 4 stars because the presentation is lacking.  I love appetizing looking food and mine kind of like gray mud. But the taste was magnificient.  It was comfort food at its best. I used Honeycrisp apples..two big ones..and only a tablespoon or more of sugar.  Walnuts and Raisins. This will definitely be a "go to" recipe for us Weight Watchers.

Great recipe! I made a couple minor modifications by using a pre-mixed "apple pie spice blend" instead of the separate spices and then topping the apple mixture with crushed gingersnap cookies then dotting it with butter before baking. This was a big hit with my friends at the potluck dinner last night!

I made this dish for my entire family during our weekly dinner and everyone loved it.  I made a few changes.  I only used cinnamon and I used 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  I also put tabs of butter over the whole dish before baking so that it wouldn't be so dry.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was GREAT!

This recipe is easy to make and tastes delicious.  As per other reviewers, I omitted the flour and added vanilla extract.  I've also added blueberries and that was great as well.

I made the recipe as stated, and I think if I were to make this again I would make some changes.  I would definitely add some type of crumb topping, with butter.  The apple mixture was only slightly moist, and really lacked the richness of other baked apple recipes I have done.  The seasonings, nuts and raisins were fine.  I would definitely cover the pan 20 minutes or so into baking to help retain moisture.  I ended up serving it with a small amount of vanilla ice cream, which was good.  However, I didn't really care for it alone.

This came out "soupy" with little flour "skins" floating on top. I salvaged it by cooking it in a large frying pan, adding butter and whisking it while letting the liquid reduce.  It still didn't look appetizing, so I poured it back in the baking dish and topped with with an apple crisp topping (oatmeal, flour, brown sugar and butter).  After baking it, it was appealing and tasted good. May I suggest an alternative?  Put the sliced apples in a frying pan with butter, add cinnamon, sugar, water and cook until apples are tender and liquid is reduced.  Apples prepared this way (fried apples) are delicious and my son's favorite.  He looks forward to any left-overs being packed in his school lunch.

I love this recipe! I also add vanilla extract, replace the whole milk with 1% or skim and use brown sugar splenda instead of the regular white sugar. The house smells amazing while this is cooking. I serve it over low fat vanilla ice cream and it tastes like a million bucks!

I made these for Easter Dinner!  They were delicious; however, following the recommendation of a few others I left the peel on...I won't do this next time.  I also used the recommendation of another to make this dish in the crockpot and sub apple cider vinegar in place of the milk.  Love the use of the crock-pot as it freed space for the oven/stove top.  This one is a keeper!

i did not even really get to taste this recipe. i might be totally clueless about the whole thing but it appears that you must eat the whole recipe as soon as you bake it because i saved it for the next day and by that time the apples had black (oxidized) splotches on them and the "dressing" type mixture looked bad and was a black mushy goo. I tried to eat a few pieces that were less tarred but I ended up just chucking it. Too bad, this recipe sounded so good.

Mixed reviews at my house.  It seemed a little holiday and was a great side dish/semi-dessert for roasted pork loin.  I loved the spices, raisins, and nuts, but my husband prefers a plain cinnamon/sugar mix on his apples.  My daughter (who will eat anything) had this with her supper and again over a pancake for breakfast the next morning.  Overall it was a nice change of pace.

I loved this, as did my husband and 2 year old. I didn't use the cloves since I didn't have any, and used chopped almonds in place of the walnuts. Instead of whole milk, I used 1%, and it turned out great. I will definitely make this again. A healthier version of apple crisp!

This was SO yummy!  However, I made a few changes...First, I didn't have any nutmeg, so I just doubled the cinnamon to compensate.  Then, I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the mix and about 1/2 a cup of quick oats.  Then I sprinkled about 1/4 of brown sugar over the top of the apples before baking.  I also substituted cream for the milk (but only because that is what I had on hand).  SOOOOOOO good!

Really good! I made these because I had some apples that were going to go bad and I needed to use em up. I subbed dried cranberrys for raisins and crushed almonds for walnuts and I used soy milk. It worked out perfect. I made homemade whipped cream to go on top.

Absolutely loved this recipe! It was a nice, fresh, guilt-free take on apple crisp and was absolutely delicious. It was so easy to throw together, but just make sure that you don't underestimate the bake time. I've made this 2 times now and have found that it takes a lot longer than I expect each time. It was borderline too sweet, but whipped cream helped cut the sweetness down a bit. Next time I think I might cut the sugar in half and drizzle some agave nectar on top before popping into the oven to give it a yummy caramel like taste.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I've only made a few modifications.  I never buy whole milk, so I substituted 1% milk.  I took the advice of others, and covered the dish with foil in the oven to lock in the moisture.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and loved the results!  With a couple scoops of frozen vanilla yogurt this dessert is a wonderful winter staple :)

I baked mine in a non-stick loaf pan. I sprayed it first with butter non-stick spray before pouring in the apple mixture. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the milk and added pads of butter on top of the apple mix and covered it. It baked for about 35 minutes at 350. Topped it with whipped cream. It was delicious ! It saved my apple. Thanks!

Did not use nutmeg. Added 1/2 cup walnut chips. Added 1 cup whole cranberries. Used 5 apples- 1 granny smith & 4 red delicious, 1/2 w/skins & 1/2 w/out. Def. will make again, but with bigger walnuts than chips. Use a big dish, so you can stir it w/out it falling out.

No one was eating the apples and they needed to be used, so where else would I go but to AR to find something to do with them? :-) This was quick and easy and hit the spot. Only change I made was to sub 1/4 cup brown sugar for 1/4 cup of the white, but next time I make this I will just drop the white sugar altogether as it was plenty sweet and drowned the taste of the apples. I think I'll also cut down on the raisins too. I also skipped the walnuts since we don't like them anyhow and used FF milk instead of whole milk and it turned out great.

My family love this recipe and so did I. I didn't add the raisins, nuts, or nutmeg (didn't have any) I add vanilla ex. and it gave it a very nice taste. Next time I will make it the right way. I bet it is so much better. I just didn't think my kids would eat it with all the other stuff. Thank you for the recipe!!

This has also become a dish I am making weekly. Since I really enjoy the "syrup" that is created by baking the apples, I have substituted apple juice for the milk and brown sugar for the white and have omitted the flour.  I add a few extra apples and use dried cranberries instead of the raisins. Walnuts or a little granola add a nice crunch. It makes a delicious, healthy topping on a scoop of frozen yogurt. Thanks for the recipe.

Great easy dessert! I used half brown sugar, dried crans and pecans (because that was what I had on hand) and it was fabulous. Tastes just like a pie or crisp filling - and much easier and healthier!  I ate it as-is warm from the oven and hubby/kids had it over vanilla ice cream.  Will definitely make it again and change it up to try different things (maybe even over pancakes for breakfast).

I actually slimmed this down for one apple, and it wasn't even granny smith. I absolutely loved this. Needed to cook for about 35 minutes, and I covered with foil as others suggested. Added extra cinnamon, extra milk, and this was just so good. Now just to find a healthy crumble ;)

This was very good. It is exactly what the title says. I like it because it is a low fat, healthy recipe. I served it plain but I agree that it would be perfect ontop of french toast, pancakes or even ice cream. The changes I made were to use fat free half'n half instead of milk. I used raspberries instead of raisins and I used a combo of white sugar and brown sugar. Very nice recipe for apples!

Excellent recipe with a few changes.  I cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup brown sugar. Plus I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added a dash of vanilla.  LOVED IT!!!  Oh yeah, I did not peel the apples and used skim milk (as that is what I had on hand)...worked just fine...:)

Great recipe. My family loved it. The only change I made was to dot with butter before baking. Also I would recommend stirring occasionally during baking. Served with ham steak and sweet potatoes. I will be trying leftovers tomorrow morning with french toast. Thanks for the recipe!

I was planning on making whole baked apples for Christmas this year but decided on this recipe because it sounded delicious and easy to make. IT WAS!!! I scaled the recipe to serve 20. I also added a package of craisins after reading the other reviews (good idea) and added a crumb topping made of equal parts flour and white sugar and enough butter to make the dough stick enough to make crumbs (plus a hint of cinnamon). I am planning on making this again soon.

This was a pleasant, tasty winter dessert. Great with or without ice cream! I would reduce the sugar depending on what type of apples you are using.

This recipe is fantastic.  I followed it to a T.  As for the apples, I used 3 freshly picked Granny Smith and 3 freshly picked Romans.  The house smelled so good while cooking these that even my 4 year old son commented on how he couldn't wait to try the end result!  We had them fresh out of the oven with ribs, and then the next night we had them left-over with whipped cream and a shortbread cookie.  Super, and will definitely make again.

It wasnt gooey sweet instead it was clumpy. The clove was very strong so I wouldn't add 1/4 tsp. I don't I'll make this again. I was able to eat it but I didn't love it.

This recipe is easy and works great exactly as written or with changes. I've made it 5 or 6 times. Tonight, I was out of milk and raisins. I used whole wheat flour. Also, I have found that the walnuts turn out crunchier if sprinkled over the top rather than mixed in. Per other reviewer suggestions, I like to use vanilla extract in the mix. I was out of vanilla tonight, so I used butterscotch schnappes. Very good!

Made as written (except whisked the milk in with flour, sugar, spice mixture ..instead of pouring milk over the top. Then tossed apples to coat. Seemed easier that way.) Stirred halfway through & again before serving. Served with vanilla icecream to the kids. Good without icecream for the adults! Be sure to use 6 LARGE apples! This may be why too spicy for some reviewers. May cut back on nutmeg next time. Loved the walnuts (pulsed in foodprocessor) might add more.

We had a lot of apples left in the fridge from the holidays, and I was looking for a quick recipe to make with pork chops. This was just right. It was equally perfect for a little dessert the next day with some vanilla ice cream. And though I wouldn't necessarily have something this sweet for breakfast, just a spoonful mixed into my plain oatmeal was a real treat!

I left the apples unpealed, skipped the walnuts, used apple cider instead of milk,  and patted the top with a little butter before baking. It turned out great and sized up well for a larger crowd! It reminded me of the baked apples we used to get at Stouffer's Sunday brunch.

I thought this was very delicious with some minor adjustments.  I used three green apples and three red apples which allowed a great sweet & sour mix of the apples. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Next time I will delete the flour and use apple cider vs. milk.  I felt the sauce was way to thick and gooey.  It was so good and a big hit with my daughter.  Will definitely make again.

The apples turned out pretty good when served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Had some issues with milk flour skin residue at the bottom. Not the best I've ever made but still good.

I just made this recipe, and it turned out splendidly.

I changed a number of things though.

1. I sliced 4 (not 6) apples as directed, and then cut them in half in order to reduce the baking time. 

2. Instead of pouring the milk over the apples, I mixed the milk with the spices so they would be better blended, and added 1 tsp vanilla extract, before pouring the mixture over the apples. Be sure to give the apples a couple of turns so they're coated.

3. I also sprinkled brown sugar over the top before throwing it all in the oven. 

The apples were ready in 30 minutes, perfect because most were very soft but some had just a little crunch to them. If you like crisper cooked apples, reduce the baking time to 20-25 mins.

I also chose a marginally healthier 2% milk, although I think my added brown sugar countered that...

Excellent recipe!

I skipped the raisins and walnuts and used skim instead of whole milk, but it came out great.  I ate it with fat free cool whip while my family enjoyed it with ice cream and cool whip.  Everyone loved it and I got to have a guilt free snack.

This is a great recipe. However, the clove is a little too strong of a taste for me. I think I will omit it next time! Otherwise, this is a quick, easy & tasty recipe!

Made this last night for the first time, as written.  I used Granny Smith apples as they are my favorite but any apple suitable for baking would work.  It turned out really good, kind of a cross between apple sauce and an apple pie without the crust.  I definitely will be making this again, thanks for sharing!

This was okay! I followed it to the letter, but used 2% milk as that is what we had. Next time I make this I will make some sort of topping with oats or something. Bit too sweet for my likeing, but the BF goggled it up!

Oh, so yummy.  I made these as a filling for tomorrow morning's crepes.  I pretty love anything that involves apples and cinnamon.  I also love raisins, so this dish was right up my alley.  I did only make 1/2 of the recipe, as I am the only one who feels that way in this house.  I also used brown sugar as some previous reveiwers suggested.  Made the house smell so good, and the milk with the sugar and spices bakes into this wonderful caramel sauce.  I can't wait for tomorrow!

Followed the recipe exactly. It was good. Definitely tastes best served with vanilla ice cream. I left 1 apple unpeeled and preferred the peeled ones better. I cut recipe in half.

My kids ask for this constantly, however we've made a few changes.  We don't peel the apples.  Just core and chop into bite size pieces.  We put these in the baking dish and top with some drizzled maple syrup or pancake syrup - the low cal/sugar free versions are plenty sweet. Sprinkle on LOTS of cinnamon and dot with butter.  Then bake.

These were good, but like another reviewer, there was too much of a flour taste.  We made them with tart dried cherries-yum.  I would cut down on the spices and the flour.  We used Braeburn apples

Very good - Love apple recipes that will allow me to use lots of apples and good for those that are too mealy for the lunchbox. Did this in the crock pot on low for 4 hours and switched out the white sugar for brown sugar. Nice comfort food snack. Thank you!

FANTASTIC, followed recipe as listed + a sprinkling of brown sugar on top. Amazing flavor, I think the fresh ground nutmeg helped. Turned out fine with 1% milk. What a great alternative to a butter-laden apple crisp. My guests were wowed with the bursting flavor of this simple dish.

Oh so simple yet yummy! I have tried it two ways, and both were great.  I did it as the recipe goes, except I used Truvia and 1%milk and they were wonderful.  The second time I used flavored creamer instead of the milk and wow!  It was such a nice "comfort-food" type treat without the guilt.

I didn't have walnuts or raisins and forgot (whoops!) to add the milk.  After baking the apples for 45 minutes they still seemed firm to me, so I stirred them and put them back in for 5 minutes. I repeated that two more times and they were finally soft enough.  These were awesome!  So mildly sweet and perfectly tender.  To those out there who found the sauce to be too rich I would suggest "forgetting" the milk. =)

I didn't like the thick sauce it made. It was too much like apple pie filling. I was looking for something a little less rich.

I think this would be a great filling for an apple pie as well! Mainly just because, while delicious, it's not that aesthetically pleasing.  I changed it up a little: I didn't peel the apples. And I also added cashews with the raisins instead of walnuts. I mixed a little vanilla with the 1% milk and poured it on top, then I sprinkled brown sugar on top of all and 4 thin slices of stick butter. I covered it with the lid, then baked it for 40 minutes. Delicious!

I liked the flavor of the apples but for me there was something incomplete about this recipe.  I liked the spice flavor of the apples, and they did bake properly.  Maybe the clove was a touch too strong.  I think I just felt like there was something missing.  I served with a scoop of ice cream, which worked nicely.  I just feel like maybe they look like a bit of a mess.  I think I could use this as a good filling for an apple pie.

I made this recipe to go with ham for dinner and thought it was great.  The only adjustments I made were:  added ~1/4 c. brown sugar on top, put in pumpkin pie spice instead of ground cloves (didn't have any), added 1 tsp vanilla, left out the milk (sounded gross to me).  I baked them at 250 degrees (same as the ham) for 1 1/4 hours.  Delish!

Great as written or with extra spices.  I always omit the flour and add 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  Yummy! Many thanks for this keeper!

I really enjoyed this.  I had tons of green apples and I didn't know what to do with them and this recipe turned out well.  I tried a different recipe on this site and didn't like it at all.  This one was pretty good. It is a little boring alone...definitely needs some ice cream, cool whip, etc., to go with it.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and 1 tsp vanilla.  I put the apples in the baking dish and then sprinkled the dry mixture on top and mixed it in the pan to slightly coat the apples.  Then I sprinkled raisins and craisins on top.  Then I put the milk (I used 2%) mixed with the vanilla on top.  I had to gently mix the apples about 5-10 minutes after about 40 minutes of baking and bake for another 5-10 minutes.  Overall this was very good and I would make it again.

Yum Yum Yum!  We had a surplus of apples in the fridge (I seem to buy them every time I go to the store) so my husband asked for baked apple dessert.  I used a combination of white and brown sugar, pecans instead of walnuts and omitted the raisins because I don't like them.  We served it with light vanilla ice cream and it really hit the spot!

This was ok.  I made it thinking it would be like the inside of a warm apple pie, but it was not.  I was sticky and not a whole lot of flavor. I will not be making this again.

This recipe is what I've been looking for!  I've been craving apple pie, mainly due the holiday season's being so full of yummy fod, but have been looking for a healthier way to enjoty it.  Well this recipe is it...apple pie without the crust.  I made mine even healthier by subsituting Xylitol (all-natural sweetener that is sugar-free) for the sugar and almond milk for the cow's milk.  I don't care for raisins so I left those out.  I also didn't have any cloves on hand, but it tastes just fine with cinnamon and nutmeg.  ...a quick note on xylitol...it is the naturally occuring sugar commonly derived from corncobs and birch trees (it is NOT the same as corn syrup which is terrible for your health).  It measures like sugar, comes in granulated form, and REALLY DOES taste like sugar without an aftertaste (unlike Equal and other sugar alternatives which are changed in form chemically and BAD for your health!)  Xylitol is perfect for diabetics, anyone trying to watch their weight without giving up sweets, and people concerned about dental health because it is actually a proven cavity fighter...back to my review...I made fresh whipped cream (sweetened with xylitol of course) and topped the apples with it.  I really felt like I was having a 'bad' dessert without the consequesnces.  I'm going to top my buckwheat pancakes next time with these apples.

This turned out very nice.  I used Braeburn apples & left the skins on.  I substituted the sugar with 1/2 Splenda & 1/2 Brown Sugar Splenda (see package for substitution amounts).  I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins (pantry option, will try raisins next time).  We drink Soy Milk, so I used that instead of whole milk.  I also used a covered cassarole dish as other suggested & sprayed it with Butter Cooking Spray. There was just a little juice at the end but it was perfectly thick/thin.  After tasting, I immediately called my mother and shared the recipe as my parents are both diabetic (diet controlled).  This may also work nice in a pie crust...will have to try that and see how it works.  This recipe is definately a keeper!

Just made this for a women's brunch, and it received rave reviews! I subbed dried cranberries for raisins and left out the nuts. Everyone loved it. And as an added bonus, my house smelled heavenly.

this was really good.  i used almond flour rather than bleached.  i think i used splenda to sweeten, rather than sugar, but no one could tell.  i will definately make these again.  i already bought more apples to do it! its a healthy sweet treat!

Delicious!  I used 1/4 c white and 1/4 c dark brown sugar and a mixture of apple juice and water instead of milk, also pecans instead of walnuts and craisins in place of raisins.  They had a wonderful caramel sauce that developed.  Everyone loved them!

This recipe was great.  I used honey crisp apples & Splenda instead of sugar.  My husband & I ate this right out of the oven, and he didn't even realize that I had used Splenda.  He loved it.

I don't understand why old fashioned baked apples went out of style.  Consider coring the apples, stuffing the core with a lightly cooked bulk sausage, cook the other ingredients on the range, and pour the mixture over the apples when they are half baked.

These are very simple and taste great.  The house will smell yummy also when cooking.  I do not use the raisens and use 2% milk instead of whole milk and it turns out great.  It is a very big hit served over vanilla ice cream.

Excellent recipe!  Made the recipe exactly are stated and served it with some frozen vanilla yogurt.  Next time I will use brown sugar instead of white which I think will give it the bit of flavor it was missing (thus 4 stars instead of 5).  I might try it with apple juice, too for a change.  The walnuts were very good, I wouldn't leave them out.  I did find the cooking temp too low - after 60 minutes they were still not cooked.  Turned the temp up to 400 and they came out thick and bubbly.  Will cook at 375 or 400 next time.

this was really good.  I only had 1% milk and it turned out fine.  we had it with ice cream, but I also think it would be wonderful on roasted pork, especially with the nutmeg and cloves.  As a desert I think it would be better with only cinnamon.  I diced up the apples and used very finely chopped pecans so it was almost a compote.

This was great! My primary goal was to make a topping for pancakes, so I made some changes, primarily not using the nuts or raisins, but I added some frozen cranberries. 

I veganized it, and it came out wonderfully. I used a full tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, light brown sugar for the sugar, added a splash of lemon juice, a tsp of vanilla extract, and used So Delicious unsweetened coconut milk. I placed some thin slices of Earth Balance vegan buttery spread on top and covered the dish before baking, stirring once.

This looked like a dish that you could make with what you had handy.  There's just two of us, so I used 2 Granny Smith apples, and 1 red sweet apple, but left on the skins.  I shook the apples with the dry ingredients in a zip lock bag.  I had pecans and raisins so I threw them in.  And like another reviewer, I put in my small 1.5 quart crockpot I use for appetizers.  Someone suggested Apple Cider, which I had.  It was fabulous.  You can eat it still crisp, or cook it softer, your choice.  We are trying to eat more fruit - a great, yummy option.  Thanks Maeven6.

It was fast and easy. For my taste, I would reduce the spices/sugar in half so there is a hint of sweetness.  Served the leftovers in mixed in oatmeal the next morning!

I did not add any sugar and used quick oatmeal instead of flour. It was great and sweet enough without the added sugar. I did double the recipe for the dry ingredients. Yum

What a great recipe and so easy to play with!  Made this yesterday as is and the kids loved it!  Today we made it again and modified it a bit just for fun.  We used brown sugar instead of white and cut the amount in half. We also omitted the nuts and added 3 slices of cooked & chopped applewood smoked bacon and served with porkchops.  AMAZING!

This was so easy and turned out great! I only had four apples to use up, so I used maybe 2 Tbs less sugar than called for. I didn't have ground cloves or walnuts but it still turned out great and plenty sweet. Perfect with vanilla ice cream! Will definitely make again.

This recipe was great! I used vanilla almond milk because that is all I had on hand. I used granny smith and red delicious apples as well. On suggested based by other I used a combination of white and brown sugar because I think brown sugar really brings out the taste in tart apples. That is a personal preference however! I took this to lunch the next day with a baked sweet potato, loaded up the baked apple mixture and tossed some marshmallows on top and microwaved until warm, melty and oooy gooey. Everyone was asking what the delicious smell was coming from the break room!

I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the recipe and it was incredible.  I was using red delicious apples so I only used a little over 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

This recipe is wonderful...
After the apple dish is baked and cooled, I take any size flour tortilla  place baked apples down the center and wrap like 
A burrito.  Spray the top of each burrito with a little   butter. Flavored Pam, sprinkle with a little cinnamon sugar and bake at 350 degrees until burrito is browned, just a few minutes, and presto  hand pies!  Let cool and enjoy.
Everyone wants to know how to make these, they are a big hit,

I was thinking this recipe would be fantastic. I don't know what I did wrong. My apples were mealy, the sugar and raisin mixture was burnt and sticky like on the bottom, the nuts were somewhat hard and over cooked, and the allspice was a bit strong. I used pink lady apples and I sprayed the pan with PAM. Maybe, it is better to grease it with something else or use a less sweet apple? I would have just preferred apple pie spice or cinnamon instead of the separate spices, being as the cloves dominated it. I had been wanting to make this for some time as it seemed like apple pie without the crust, which I thought would be a perfect dessert. I almost want to try it again to see what could have went wrong. Maybe, when my apple tree grows some apples. They are just too costly at the store right now to waste even more.

I made a few changes, but it still turned out great! I didn't have milk, so instead I drizzled a bit of maple syrup and vanilla extract. I also experimented a bit further and made a batch of pears and even a batch of asian pears with this recipe.. Hopefully they turn out just as good!

I tried this recipe and made a few adjustments. In place of sugar I used two individual packets of Stevia along with a bit of honey. I used whole wheat flour. I changed the nutmeg and cloves to just a pinch but the cinnamon remained the same. I used pecans, added a few teaspoons of smart balance and a 1/4 tsp of vanilla. It was excellent.

I substituted brown sugar for white, used 1/8 tsp of cloves, and omitted the walnuts (didn't have any.) Mixed ingredients together in crockpot and cooked for one hour on high and two hours on low. I really didn't enjoy the taste of the raisins after they soaked up the liquid, but the apples were wonderful! We used them to top ice cream. I had them with a dollop of fat free cool whip for a lighter treat. It went fast with our family of four. I'll definitely have to double the recipe next time and try the walnuts.

I was craving baked apples and found this recipe. I followed directions almost exactly but omitted cloves. I found it very plain and the liquid wasn't sweet the way I like it. The milk made it that way I'm guessing. I also used brown sugar instead of white . Still wasn't good enough that I would ever make again. Will stick to my granny smith apple pie.

This recipe was de-lish! On spur-of-the-moment we invited people over to watch football, and I wondered what I could make for dessert that wouldn't involve a supermarket trip.  This is simple, quick to put together (though it bakes for 45 min), & made with ingredients you most likely have around the house except for maybe walnuts. I think this would be fine without the nuts, but they do provide a nice crunch in place of a crust.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and tossed the ingredents into the crock pot. This was easy and would be great for hot summer days when you want something sweet  but don't want to heat the oven. My partner and I both don't like raisins and I don't eat nuts in food so I  left those out and made her a walnut syrup topping to go on her's and made homeade whip cream to top all. This will be a go to next time I will half the apples, core and place skin side down. I will also mix all the other ingredients together and then pour over the apples.

So I thought these were delicious, although mine took longer to cook than directed--I ended up turning off the oven and leaving the apples in the warm oven for about an hour, and that worked for me.  I don't have whole milk and just used skim--what I have--and I thought it worked just fine.  The spices, milk, and juices from the apples combine to make a nice little sauce.  Bf was a bit on the fence on this dish, but he says he doesn't really like baked apples anyway . . .so we'll go with what I think, which is these are very good . . .probably even better with ice cream or on waffles.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe! I added a little vanilla to it and it tasted awesome and the best part is that it isn't high in calories. The prep time says 30 min but it actually took me less than 15 min to prepare and I baked it for about 40 min on 300 degrees. It was scrumptious topped with vanilla ice cream!

I just made this and think I could eat the entire pan myself!  I followed the recipe and only made a few small changes:  less nutmeg and cloves because I don't like too much of those spices.  I used 1/4 cup splenda for baking instead of 1/2 cup.  I also used a huge handful of craisins.    I mixed the dry ingredients then added the milk and poured it all over the apples.    I baked for 40 minutes uncovered, then 20 minutes covered.  Came out of the oven bubbling and smelling wonderful.   Enjoy!

This was pretty good. I added about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of oats to it (I don't measure) and I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. It was great on a chilly fall night following some squash soup!

This is a great recipe!  I suggest spooning a large amount over a thick slice of banana bread.  Drizzle plate with honey and top with a dusting of cinnamon!  It might also be delicious with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream inbetween the apples and bread...just sayin!

I used this recipe to the letter- it's brilliant. It makes my home smell almost as good as this wonderful dish tastes. I've made the recipe several times, (it works each and every one) and a couple times I've even left the peels on the apples, which is also delightful if you don't have time for peeling!

I cut the recipe in half and reduced the sugar down to 1/8th of a cup. I used Granny Smith apples and used 1 teaspoon homemade apple pie spice. I really think this would be just as good with either brown sugar, honey or even maple syrup. I'd really like to try this with pecans next time. This is almost like crisp filling. GREAT with plain yogurt spooned over the top.

Made this with honey instead of sugar, added a little hot freshly brewed coffee to help dissolve the honey and spices- delicious! Had some right out of the oven, and that night, and for breakfast, definitely a satisfying replacement for apple cobbler/pie.

This was very good, but I must have done something wrong because my apples never softened. I cooked them for one hour and they were still hard? My children loved them anyway and I will defintely cook again but will probably try cooking them in the crock pot next time.

I made this with pears instead of apples because I had some leftover, and put several pats of butter on top just before baking.  Delicious!!!!  Served with crepes as a breakfast for dinner.  This is a great way to use up extra fruit, or fruit that is nearing its prime.  Thanks!

This is superb with MacIntosh and Granny Smith apples.  I also added 1/2 cup cranberries.  You only need to bake it for approximately 45 minutes, if that.

This was a good healthy dessert.  I followed the recipe exactly, except left out the cloves because we didnt have any. The apples were a little crunchy and probably could have cooked a while longer. Will probably make again - thanks!

Yummy! I used pecans instead of walnuts and used less than half the white sugar, then sprinkled a little brown sugar on top. So good. I will be making this again.

I used Splenda and fat-free 1/2 & 1/2.  I followed the other's suggestions about putting the spices & flour into a ziplock.  That worked perfect.  I also left out the raisins since I didn't have any.  I'm rating it 4 stars because it looks awful but the taste is pretty  good.  I'll make it again but never for guests.

Great recipe! I used another reviewer's idea and put the flour and spices in a zip lock bag then coated the apples evenly before transferring to the mini crock pot. I made mine "weight watchers friendly" by substituting half of the white sugar with 1/4 cup granulated Splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar. A half cup serving = 2 points. Tastes great...like apple pie filling...yummy! It makes great addition to oatmeal!

These aren't bad, but if I make it again I will use less cloves and sugar and omit the flour. The cloves were a little overpowering and it just didn't need that much sugar for my taste. The flour seemed completely useless; it just clumped up in little gummy blobs around the apples.

I tried it with skim milk and walnuts. Should've left the skim milk out because it looked like it curdled in the cooking. Also, I cut my apples too big so they were still crunchy, will cut them smaller next time. I'm sure it'll be better next time. It's great with vanilla icecream sprinkled with cinnamon!

It was super easy and delish.  I added pecans, increased the nutmeg (didn't have cinnamon) and instead added a dash of ginger powder. I also decreased the sugar.  Thank you for this great dish.

It was fantastic!! My husband loved it!! I mixed wondra flour and a little vanilla in the milk and poured over the fruit mixture. Aso I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I found it a bit sweet. (My husband thought it was fine.) I might try it again with just white sugar. Either way it is a keeper!!

I made this for my family this morning and it was delicious! I added a little vanilla to the milk, a little extra cinnamon and some brown sugar. Also, I didn't have any raisins but I had a box of Raisin-Almond Trail Mix cereal so I sprinkled that on it as well and covered it with aluminum foil. It had a great flavor and the cereal added a nice little crunch to it. :)

I had about a half of a bag of Granny Smith apples that I didn't know what to do with and really wasn't up for baking a pie.  This recipe looked easy and tasty so I gave it a whirl.  I'm glad I did!!  I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and cooked it in my crockpot.  I omitted the nuts.  The whole house smelled amazing and the apples came out at just the perfect texture and spiced perfectly for my family's taste.  They're great on their own or with ice cream.  I think this is going to be my go-to "what do I do with these apples?" recipe.  Thanks!

This was really good. I made it, tested it, and decided to bake Bisquik shortcakes to go with it as it was too sweet to be a side dish for my family. (We still had it as a sidedish--apple shortcakes for a side dish!) I used Granny Smiths and heavy cream and I just sort of dumped walnuts and raisins in it--I like them, and it won't hurt to have extras! My only complaint is that the spice mixture is a bit heavy on the nutmeg to me. I will reduce the nutmeg by half next time, but I will definitely make it again--I think I might like this better than strawberries for shortcake!

Very good.  I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and piled it all in the crockpot, so easy.  However, I would next time leave out the nuts using this method as they were a bit spongey (traditional baking might not produce this result).  Will use this recipe again, a big hit with my husband who loves cooked apples.

I did not care for this as a dessert. Although it was very good the next morning on oatmeal. Will make again as a breakfast topping on oatmeal or pancakes.

Basically about what I expected when I went into this. I wasn't sure about the milk - ended up using evaporated (other option was 1% but I wanted to be closer to the original recipe). I found that the flour clumped a bit...it didn't affect the flavors, it just looked less appealing. Loved it with walnuts, craisins, and golden raisins. Yum! No need to wait for fall to use this recipe!

Delicously simple! I used Granny Smith apples, brown sugar instead of white, craisins instead of raisins, and pecans instead of walnuts. I also added a pinch of salt. It was wonderful, but all my craisins and pecans went to the bottom, so next time I will sprinkle them on top just b4 baking and really, I think it may be wise to mix the dry ingredients w/ the milk and then pouring over top cuz all my dry stuff went to the bottom and I had to stir and stir to get it mixed once it was done baking and everything stuck to my spoon. I served it with Cool Whip. Everyone loved it and I cannot wait to have leftovers :)

I love this!!!!!! I dont know why anybody would give it less than 5 stars. I subsituted whole wheat flour added some vanilla, and pinch salt, and used rapadura sugar instead of white and reduced the overall amount. I thought it was a great healthier alternative to dessert!!! will definately be making it again when the sweet cravings strike!!! Thank you!!

I thought this was good but next time I will adjust the amount of nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon.  Nutmeg can be overpowering and in my opinion, it overpowered this dish.  I think brown sugar would give it that extra something that is missing here.

When I make baked apples I do it in the microwave.  Takes about 5 minutes per apple.  I do not use sugar, but substitute some of my Torani flavored (for lattes) syrup.  My favorite flavor is hazelnut, but vanilla works well also.  About 1 tblsp will do.  I core the apple, place it upright in a glass bowl and pour all the ingredients down the center where the core was.  I serve warm with vanilla ice cream.  Makes a fast, wonderful and somewhat healthy dessert for a winter evening.

Very tasty! I omitted the walnuts and raisins, left the skin on the apples and sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking. I think next time I'll take off the skin and use another reviewer and add granola on top to add some crunch as I don't care for nuts and I think raisins sound grossss in there. All in all a great recipe!

I have never liked baked apples before and I LOVED this. Served as a side dish. We are non-dairy so I used vanilla soymilk (since other reviewers recommended adding vanilla extract I thought that would be good and it was). Also used organic black raisins, and sweet dried cranberries. Fantastic!

Quick and easy, I used sweet n low in place of sugar because I'm on a diet + my dad is diabetic. You could barely notice the difference, might try splenda next time to see if its better. I also added a little brown sugar on top with a few teaspoons of "I can't believe its not butter". I did this on a whim with the last two apples on hand so I'd love to try it again with nuts or raisins. Good alternative dessert for dieters :)

This was simple but delicious!  My 6 year old son devoured two helpings!  I had to omit the nuts and raisins because I didn't have any.  I did sprinkle a little brown sugar on top too before baking.  My husband and son added carmel topping to their's.  It got rave reviews in our house.  I will make this again soon.  Thanks for sharing!

This dish is delicious! The blend of spices is just right. I had pecans and craisins on hand so that's what I used and I really think the craisins added a nice touch, but I am sure using regular raisins would be really good too. I used a blend of three apples - honeycrisp, macintosh, and gingergold. It got rave reviews at the dinner I brought it to. Will definitely make it again!

I made this dish for work.  I did a few things differently.  Instead of 1/2 cup white sugar, I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  And the last thing I changed was, instead of 1/2 cup whole milk, I used 1/2 cup half and half.  It came out very nice!  A lot of people said it was very tasty and thanked me for bringing it.  I will certainly make this dish again!  Thanks for submitting this recipe!  :)

Very good, but I kept getting the feeling that these were missing something when I ate them. Couldn't quite put my finger on it though. I did bake them a little longer than the recipe called for, which was fine. I also didn't peel my apples, but I will next time. The peels got pretty soft, but there were still too chewy for my taste. Thanks again for the recipe!

I made these last night and they were yummy. I didn't add raisins or nuts but the flavor was still good. The flour seemed to clump a little and gave it a weird consistency. I will definitely make these again but without the flour.

We enjoyed this very much.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and it worked great!  Because I didn't want this to be like pie filling, I kept the apple slices pretty thick.  I actually just cut the apples into eighths.  After an hour, the apples were soft but not droopy.  I'm going out right now to get more apples so we can have this again today.  It's nice to have a fruit recipe that can be used as a side dish instead of desert.

I love the leftovers for breakfast :)  I put a couple of spoons of baked apples (from the fridge) in a bowl, top with some granola cereal, sprinkle a few drops of water on the granola, heat it in the microwave for 1.25 minutes, and stir it all together ~ yummers!

I make this recipe a lot.  However, I use 1 tsp. of cinnamon and leave out the other spices.  I also use 1% milk and omit the raisins and nuts.  It is just like apple pie filling, but good for you!  Other fruits such as pears, peaches, or cherries would work well with this recipe too.

I loved this recipe!  I seemed to have too much flour (my sauce was a little too thick) so I added some orange juice.  It was great, I loved the citrus flavor coupled with the sugar and tart apples.  I will make this over and over again.

This was the first time I have ever attempted baked apples of any kind- and they turned out SO YUMMY!  This recipe was fast, easy and very easily modified. 

 I only had 3 apples so I halved the recipe, I discovered I had no milk so I subbed Non-fat sweetened condensed milk and then only added about 2 Tbs of light brown sugar to sweeten it a little more.  I took the advice from the other reviewers and added a splash of vanilla extract, plus I like spices so I added some extra cinnamon and a little Allspice.  I left the peel on the apples, which made the dish super quick to prepare!
    I did NOT like the flour- it came off of the apples and ended up floating around in the "sauce", so next time I will just use the sugar and spices to coat the apples.

All in all a great recipe and I will definitely make it again!!!

Made this for Thanksgiving as I thought it was something my nieces and nephews (ages 2 - 7) would enjoy.  Everyone, including the kids, really liked it.  I used a combination of McIntosh & Granny Smith.  I used 1/2 apple juice and 1/2 1% milk for the liquid.  I left out the nuts and raisins as I was mainly setting out to please the kids.  I also added cinnamon to the flour mixture and sprinkled the apples with brown sugar once they were in the baking dish.  I stirred a couple times during baking to ensure even baking.  This was really good and I will be making it often.  It also went together quickly.  Thanks!

I made this recipe, minus the walnuts and raisins and put it over puff pastry circles and added a little bit of vanilla bean ice cream. It was heaven! I also used half apple cider and half milk- yum!

I really liked this recipe.  I modified by making it with three pears and three apples.  I also used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 brown sugar.  I also used skim milk.  I will make again.  Thanks.

This was very delicious and the hit of the dinner plate! Served with rice, broccoli and pork chops, which it complemented well.  I used golden delicious apples,substituted extra cinammon for the cloves (personal preference) and used dried cranberries instead of nuts and raisins since that's what I had on hand. Very yummy - I ate more for dessert! I'll keep this recipe on hand!

Good.  My family and I love baked apples.  My family enjoyed this recipe.  The only suggestion I have is to add less raisins.  I would reduce it to 1/4 c of raisins.

I made this side dish for Thanksgiving & everyone really enjoyed!  Used 6 large Granny Smith Apples and added Craisins (don't like raisins).  Took other reviewers advice & mixed in some vanilla extract to the milk...  not sure it made any difference or not. I also tossed apples with lemon juice as I was peeling/slicing to avoid any browning prior to baking.  Leftover apples were still great 2 days later reheated!  Thanks for sharing.

I tried it because it didn't have added butter.  The flour was not to my taste.  I think I'll try the sauteed apples next time.

I've been making this every year around Thanksgiving for the past 6 years, ever since I discovered it here!  I made it exactly as written the first time I made it, though now I tend to leave out raisins and nuts due to the variety to whom I serve it.  Instead, I throw in frozen cranberries and let them bake with it.

Tasted a lot like my grandma's baked apples which are my favorite. I doubled the amount of cinnamon and added a little extra ground clove and left out the nutmeg. I also did not add nuts or raisins because I do not normally use them in baked apples. All in all a very good turn out. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a quick fall dessert, but I think it would be good as a side dish for brunch sometime or over oatmeal.  I will decrease the clove and nutmeg next time.

Made a few changes based on other reviews and will definitely make again. I used one of those apple cutter things that makes 8 sections and then cut those in half. Added 1tsp vanilla extract, cut sugar to 1/4 cup, cut cloves to a pinch, cut/swapped liquids to 1/4 cup apple cider. Tossed it all in the slow cooker for 3.5hrs on high which was a little too long as it came out more like an extra chunky apple sauce (still delicious). Would recommend 2.5-3hrs.

I made this in the crockpot instead of in the oven.  Took about 3 hours on high setting.  Consistency was perfect but there was too much clove in it for my taste.  Will remake it again but omit the clove.

Simple. Had all ingredients on hand except the nuts so omitted. My husband really liked them and we topped with Vanilla ice cream and cool whip. Next time I may omit the cloves or lessen the amount. Will make again.

I made it as the recipe says only added sliced almonds and salted butter on top, covered it with foil 30 mins then removed it for the rest 30 mins. Like some suggested. Hubby loves it, had 2 bowls right after it is done.

Absolutely delicious. I covered in foil and added dried cherries and some oats 20 minutes before the end of the baking time. Ten minutes before the end of baking time, I added a bit of brown sugar. Rave reviews from me to the author of this recipe! Rave reviews from my life partner to me :D

I didn't have all of the spices so I used all spice instead. I also incorporated brown sugar and granola from another reviewer. Everyone loved it! Next time I'm going to add more milk so there's more sauce.

I wanted it to have more flavors for me personally. However, I used a semi plain apples. Easy to make and the apples were perfectly soft.

I made with no sugar and added raisins the first batch and cranberries the second. It was a hit.

Good but nothing spectacular.  Not sure I would make it again, however, I made it on the healthier side- almond flour, stevia- so for a "healthy" dessert it may be repeated.   I think I would prefer pecans next time.  Omitted the cloves.  I sprayed a crock pot, mixed it all in a Ziploc bag and dumped in the pot.  I did cut up about 1.5 TB butter and just dotted over the top.  Cooked a good 4 hours.  Didn't mix until done.  Would be great with ice cream but then not so healthy ;)

save time! prepare as stated, than bake in microwave, covered, 5 minutes! perfection!!!! Also, i was low on apples, so i used 2 smallish apples ( DID NOT PEEL,  just washed, cored, and chopped)  and 1 standard size can of "light" peaches plus the juice from the can. because i used the juice, I omitted the milk and cut the added sugar in half.  Also, no cloves on hand so used allspice ( which has cloves in it, i think??) and this was outstanding with pancakes in JUST 5  MINUTES!!!!!

I needed it find a way to use up some apples before grocery shop day.. And stumbled upon this simple recipe. I decided to make them a bit more healthier to suit my 21 day fix diet. I only used 3 apples, slices fairly thick as I don't like mushy. I upped the spices, added a pinch of salt and some vanilla. Subbed maple syrup for sugar and Unsweetened Almond milk for whole milk. 
I gave it a quick taste and it's amazing. I will be having it on top my steel cut oats tomorrow morning. Would be great on pancakes too. 
Since I changed so much I decided to submit my own recipe inspired by this one.. Thank you. :)

This was very good and easy added extra nutmeg and butter. All I needed was crust and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I made it without the nuts and used Granny Smith apples, Stevia and almond milk to cut down on calories. Everyone loved them! Next time I will cut the apples into 1/4" or 1/2" chunks. They come out very hot so be careful! Yum!

The only thing that I substituted was brown sugar for the white.  I ate it with a little whip cream on top.  It may have been better on top of vanilla ice cream. Won't make again. I prefer the recipe for sauteed apples on this site.

I used hazelnut milk instead of whole milk, and substituted brown sugar for the white sugar. I used freshly grated spices as well, and I baked it for only 35 minutes. It was delicious, and I plan to make it again very soon!

Awesome treat! Made it in smaller quantity and divided into individual baking dishes. Used fat-free half and half and omitted the nutmeg, increased the cinnamon a bit. Great complement to French toast.

I made some changes to this:  
I used 4 apples peeled and sliced, added a layer of uncooked Quaker Oats to the top, and covered with 1 cup of fat fee milk, then placed sliced butter on top.  
I covered the pan with foil and cooked for 10 min.  After 10 min, I pulled it and mixed all ingredients.  Recovered with tinfoil, and baked for another 30 minutes.  I mixed one last time, and kept it in for another 5 minutes.  
For my family of three this was a perfect amount for breakfast.  Will make again.

Very good!  Love the thickness and gooeyness of the sauce - I've never added milk to any cinnamon apple recipe, and I'm so glad I tried this!  I was making this for adults and kids to go along with pork; because there were picky kids coming, I left out the raisins and nuts.  (I'm sure that addition would only make it better!)  (I did add some craisins to the adult portion as I warmed it up prior to serving.)

Added vanilla per other reviews.  Cut down sugar to 1/4 cup, and used brown sugar.  It's easier to microwave the milk with the brown sugar so it dissolves, and add everything to the milk, then dump on the apples.

This recipie was simple as the name says and very good. I omitted the raisins and walnuts because I did not have them. I used a variety of apples that I had on hand, some softened up better than others, and used 2% milk. I will make this again.

I was looking for something a little sweet to go with our dinner one night and came across this recipe.  One of my children thought it had a little too much cinnamon/spices.  But that didn't seem to prevent it from getting devoured!  Would taste great with a little vanilla ice cream!

I used 3 Red Delicious and 3 Granny Smith apples and except for using light cream instead of the whole milk, I followed the recipe, and these apples were delicious.  They took slightly more than an hour to cook and soften enough for my liking.  I will definitely make this dish again.

This recipe is very good. But I decided to try something different with this recipe. Instead of the raisins,I added 1\2cup of chopped dates and 1\4 cup of skim milk and 1\4 cup of Italian sweet cream coffee creamer.Delicious!
Another way that is really good is omit the sugar and milk all together. Mix a little honey on it and put a couple of dollops of margarine before putting in the oven

Fabulous. I followed the recipe, except I omitted the walnuts, only because my husband doesn't care for them. I also added a handful of red hots. I put a lid on the dish the last 15 minutes. Added this to my favorites.

I tried this recipe this afternoon and it tasted pretty good. I didn't have nutmeg so I substituted allspice which worked out pretty well. The sauce, however, had a horrible consistency. The next time I try it I think I'll use less flour and a bit more sugar (half white, half brown).

Made this in the slow cooker to serve with thick-cut pork chops on the grill.  Wonderful.  Very mellow, comforting dish.  Easy and delicious. I made it exactly as written but omitted the nuts (kids won't eat them).  Loved it!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will make often.

I've tried this 2 ways--crockpot and oven.  I overcooked it in the crockpot--watch out for mushy apples/applesauce! Used Granny Smith apples for the tartness.  This is a lovely dish for cooler temps. I like the addition of vanilla and about 1-2 Tbsp of butter. I used pumpkin pie spice--thanks for a great recipe!

Omitted the raisins and walnuts, I really did not like the consistency of the sauce, I think from the addition of the milk. I much prefer skillet apples with butter, sugar and cinnamon.

Had to make this twice to get it right.  Even with thin apples slices, it needed over 1 hour cook time and good stir at 45 minutes.  The applies need to touch the milk to soften fast enough - so I also switched to a 3 qt 9x13 pan. You can cut the sugar in half without noticing it in flavor.

Upon removal from the oven, it looked nice, but underneath it wasn't very attractive.  Tasted good, but was really runny and the milk curdled.

I used granny smith apples, and I think it would have been a lot better with a different variety. I loved the spice, nuts, and raisin mixture. I might try it again with a different type of apple!

This makes a great cold-weather side dish. I followed the directions exactly only omitting raisins since we don't care for them. Only change was to stir the apples halfway through for even baking. Turned out terrific, not too sweet, which makes it a good side dish.

It was too dry!  Also, the ingredients didn't distribute evening. I didn't read the reviews before I baked this, so that was my mistake. Next time I'll do as other users suggested by mixing the dry in a bag and shaking it or fixing the wet and dry ingredients then pouring it over the apple and covering the dish so it won't get dry.

Such a perfect family dessert!  I'm going to try replacing the flour with almond flour and the sugar with vanilla stevia for a really healthy, gluten-free dessert.

This recipe is fantastic! I used light vanilla soy milk and split the amount of sugar between white and brown. Also, I've used apple pie spice and cinnamon and it turned out great. Thank you thank you thank you for posting!

definitely enjoyed this recipe! i had some leftover apples and i didn't want them to go to waste so i was looking for something simple and sweet to make with them and this was perfect. all of the ingredients were simple items i didn't even have to leave my house to get, which was a plus! the prep time was a little long, but it was worth it. i skipped the walnuts and ground cloves cus i didn't have any, but it still came out how i expected. i even threw in some oranges for some extra sweetness. tastes awesome with any kind of icecream over it and i think next time im gonna try putting the same recipe inside of a pie crust! delicious, simple and crafty. 5 stars, loved it! definitely a must try.

Made 3 separate little (bread) pans for those who didn't like raisins, etc. but we all really liked it (as recipe was written, scaled down to size)!  Hubby and son added ice cream; I added nonfat vanilla yogurt. Felt like I was cheating! :)  Will bake less than 60 minutes as they were a bit overcooked and now I have pans to scrub...ugh.

This was only ok.  The nutmeg & cloves were overbearing.  I didn't think the milk added anything to the recipe.  I used brown sugar instead of white but it still wasn't my favorite.  My family didn't care for it much either.  Disappointing.

This was so easy and so so yummy! I did change a few things.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  I also omitted the cloves (not a big fan) and the raisins and walnuts (because I didn't have any).  I also covered it in foil before baking.  So so good over some vanilla ice cream!! :)

These baked apples were so delicious and equally as easy to make. I prepared the apples, put them in the oven then continued on preparing our Sunday morning brunch. By the time the bacon, eggs and french toast were done, the apples were coming out of the oven. Great dish!

This was a big hit! The only thing differently I will do next time is cover the casserole dish in the oven. They didn't come out "bubbly," just "done." (I may have completely missed the part about covering the casserole dish.)

This was delicious with pork chops!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but microwaved them for about 10 minutes instead of baking for an hour (didn't have enough time to bake them when I got home from work).  My family loved them...said it tasted like apple pie filling without the crust!  Would be good with almonds or pecans instead of walnuts!

I made this recipe gluten free by ommitting flour and using 1 1/2 packets of instant oatmeal blueberries and cream. I also reduced the sugar to about 3 teaspoons and added 4 packets sweet and low. I too used a ziplock bag to shake up apples and topping... worked great! Skim milk worked fine here. I added 1 cup over ripe blueberries too. The oats and blueberries made the dish look fantastic.  Really yummy EASY comfort food!!!

I made this for dessert and served it warm with half-and-half on top. It was delicious. My dad said the only thing he would change is make a bigger bowl next time.

Great recipe.  I didn't have any raisins but it still came out wonderful.  I can't wait to make it again.  The walnuts make it very special so don't skip those!

I wasn't happy with the taste.  I really think this needs brown sugar rather than white sugar.  It also needs to be a bit more saucy.  There is no 'body' in the taste.  Next time I will prepare with brown sugar and on the stove top rather than in the oven.  I did like the walnuts and next time I will also use the yellow raisins rather than the regular black ones.

Like many other reviewers, I also made a couple of changes...I increased the cinnamon and used apple cider instead of milk (sounded strange to me), but these were fabulous!  So easy and such a great addition to our otherwise run of the mill "breakfast dinner".  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love serving this as a side to oatmeal and french toast, but I also think it would make a great dessert. I make as written except that I don't bother peeling the apples, it really cuts down on the prep time that way.

Made exactly as written minus the cloves... super yummy! A tiny too sweet for my taste, but we are a low sugar family. I'll just half it next time. What a great fall treat after apple picking with the kids. Thank you for this new addition to our favorites!

I tried this recipe because I already had all ingredients on hand. I found it dry. The bottom half was nice and moist, but the top half was dry. Overall, the taste was not exceptional. I expected more.

This was pretty good! I omitted the cloves, added more cinnamon(not to sure how much more, I just added until it tasted good) and added brown sugar(again just added until tasted right). I thought the milk was a great idea to add over the apples, never done this before, used Horizon 1%, it was yummy! I topped with a little more brown sugar on top, and as other review's stated added a little butter...will make again.  We had this night 2 with caramel flavored ice cream OMG so good!

Really great, not too sweet. Next time will go a bit lighter on the cloves, a bit more cinnamon and spread some brown sugar on top. We also put some butter on top before baking. Overall, a definite do-again. Bring on some vanilla ice cream with it too!

I thought this was a great easy receipe.  It smelled fantastic baking in the oven!  I just used my apple wedger to slice the apples, but I think next time I'll slice them thinner because I let them bake a full hour and they were still not as softly cooked as I'd have liked.  I left the peels on for texture and color (and laziness), so that may have caused them to take longer too.  Also, I used splenda/sugar blend, which probably didn't carmelize as well as regular sugar would have.  But still it was great.  I actually didn't have flour on hand, so I just added lots of granola.  It was very good and I'll definitely make it again.

This was wonderful. I made a half batch and did make some changes: Added vanilla to the milk as suggested. I only had 1% and so I cut thin slices of butter (about 1 1/2 tablespoon total) on top before putting in  I recommend stirring it half way through to coat the apples again since the filling falls to the bottom. It was very yummy and I will of course make it again. I may cook it longer though because the apples were rather hard, unlike soft apple pie apples. :)

Excellent, this was a real hit at a recent barbeque.  I also used Splenda (a guest has diabetes) and mixed quaker oats, splenda and cinnamon as a topping and butter on top as well.  Was excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I like to think of this recipe as apple pie without the crust.  It is very good and easy to make!  I added vanilla to fat free milk before I poured it over the apple mixture.  I also added brown sugar and a few dollops of butter on the top of the apples before I covered it and baked it for 50 minutes.  For the last 10 minutes, I uncovered the pan so it could crisp a little bit.

Delicious...I omitted the raisins & used fat-free half & half.  I served as is, but thought of all the different ways you could serves this:  mixed with oatmeal, granola or another cereal or w/ vanilla yogurt or ice cream or whipped topping.

Awesome!  Changes: doubled spices, sprinkled craisins and nuts on top so they wouldn't "sink".  Serve with vanilla ice cream for a taste of heaven.

We really enjoyed this! I made it to go over stuffed crepes and it was delish! Next time, I do think I will add some vanilla and cover the dish to cook at lower temp for a little longer. Or maybe I'll try it in the crockpot. I'll definitely be making this again and again!

An excellent treat during the winter!  I thought the spices were well-balanced and the entire dish was very tasty.  I used 6 Granny Smith apples, and after 50 mins. they were very tender (almost mushy), so next time I will reduce the baking time.  My kids went back for seconds, so this recipe gets five stars!

This was pretty good. My daughter liked them. I think I overcooked them because it almost turned into applesauce. Will make again.

Simple and Tastey!!  I didn't use the cloves, raisins, or nuts (not my tastes!), but turned out great still. Since I made a smaller helping, I didn't have to cook it as long...I also added a bit more sugar and cinnamon (I'm a sweet freak!), tossed with caramel extract and topped with brown sugar after the milk.

These were the perfect Fall side dish!  I opted out of the raisins and nuts (allergies) but they were still yummy!  It was like having apple pie without the crust.  Served with Italian Breaded Pork Chops, and the family LOVED it!

Very good.  I followed the recipe except I didn't use the cloves and I substituted pumpkin pie spice for nutmeg.  My family loved it.  It was easy and a nice accompaniment to baked chicken.

Just okay. I found the cloves to be overpowering. I should mention my milk went bad, which I didn't realize before I made it; I had to use water instead. Maybe that made the difference.

Fancier than regular baked apples but simpler than apple crisp, this made for a nice, refreshing dessert after a heavy meal. I added a splash of vanilla, used craisins instead of raisins, and soy milk instead of regular. A sprinkle of brown sugar over the top made gave it fabulous flavor.

These are great! Super simple and very flavorful. I halved the recipe and reserved the remaining sugar, flour and spice mix for the next time. This will definately be a staple in our household.

Turned out great! However, I decided to use both granny smith and macintosh apples and leave the skins on for added color and texture.  Not to mention there are a lot of nutrients in the skins for an added health bonus.

We tried this using the Yellow Delicious we had in the house and just loved it. Added some whipped topping and ate it right out of the stove..YUMMY! The Delicious apples added extra sweetness I'm sure and if I was to use those again, I'd most likely reduce the sugar accordingly. The walnuts tasted great, but we omitted the rasins because the child ate them all..LOL  Thanks for sharng!

Excellent! This hit the spot for something sweet and delicious.  I made an apple pie a couple of weeks ago, and my 5 year old daughter asked me to make another pie without the crust because she loved the apples.  This was a little twist on that and was yummy!  Might make twice the recipe next time because these went too fast.  I did use brown sugar instead of white and was out of raisins.  I will try it with raisins next time.

I was looking for a healthier version of apple crisp and this was exactly what I was looking for. I left the peels on the apples, used whole wheat flour, and used skim milk so I could claim it was a side dish instead of a dessert. It still turned out great!  I didn't have any nuts so I tried grape-nuts cereal instead which worked well.

I didn't have cloves and I left out the raisins and walnuts but this was awesome with McIntosh apples and a splash of vanilla flavoring!  Next time I make it I'll probably use Granny Smith as it's hard to find good McIntosh in Colorado.  I will also throw in some brown sugar and almonds to see if I can improve on it even more.  Husband said don't change a thing, he couldn't believe how yummy these were even though they weren't his favorite, Granny Smith.  A little healthier than the fried apples he is so fond of (he's from the south and I'm trying to get him off the fried food addiction).  The only thing I really didn't like about them is how ugly they looked after cooking.  They stuck to the dish so they were a big pile of goo when I scooped them out.  Great-tasting goo though!

Great flavor, but just a little too done for us.  Next time we will take them out a few minutes early.  Thanks for the recipe!

great recipe and super super easy. I only made it for my husband and I but we both loved it. Only change would be some sort of topping, maybe i will try it next time with a change and I would serve it with vanilla ice cream :)  All in all, very happy with it and hubby loved it.
