I am always looking for a good salsa recipe. The tomatoes definitly have to be cooked longer than 5 minutes, and the flavor was really .."blah". Usually a cooked salsa will be mashed or blended. I am not sure if its supposed to be fresh salsa or not..Not happy..still searching for a good recipe.

The taste of a broiled tomato is delicious!  You're not going to be able to "chop" your tomatoes once their broiled because they basically turn to mush but don't fret, they're still yummy.  If you want a chunkier salsa I suggest chopping up a couple fresh tomatoes without broiling them.  As for the actual taste of this salsa, it's just "alright" for me.  I am not a cilantro fan but my boyfriend & roommate are and they enjoyed it very much.  Too much cilantro for me and I didn't even use the entire half cup it calls for.  I also roasted up a jalapeno for more heat.

I made the mistake and made it with a jalapeno pepper minus the seeds.  VERY BLAND.  My grocery store is NOT very diverse, so couldn't find the right pepper.

I love salsa, and this one was awesome! The broiled tomatoes added a great touch, and I did not have any difficulty chopping them. Made a double batch of this for a party, and it was the first thing gone. Not a super-spicy salsa, but very savory and good.
