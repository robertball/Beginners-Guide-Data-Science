Gave it 5 stars because it's a good traditional recipe. The recipe is silent here, but you must always pick, soak and rinse the dried peas. If you make it more traditional by using smoked hog jowles, ham hocks, or smoked pork neck bones, instead of ham, it'll taste even better. We use the water fom cooking the pork for the liquid in this dish. Also, our preference is for a can of Rotel tomatoes, drained, instead of the purred tomatoes. There are several DO NOT's if you want to keep this dish "lucky"
1. Do not add chicken stock, as chickens and other fowl move backward as they eat.
2. Do not use beef, as a cow will move forward, sideward and backwards as it grazes, whereas, a pig always "pushes" forward as it eats.
3. Do not use canned peas as they've already swelled, so your luck will not "swell" as it will with dried peas.

Excellent!  I did make a couple of changes though.  I used fresh black eyed peas and cooked them in 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 water (do not use the recipe's water measurements--way to much water!).  I only used 1 onion (b/c that's all I had) and 1 tsp onion powder.  I substituted 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic for the powder.  My can of tomatoes were petite diced w/ bell pepper, celery, & onion.  I like my beans with a bit of a kick so I also added cajun seasoning.  I only used about 1.5 cups of ham because that's all I had on hand.  Everyone loved it...even the kids! De-lish!

These came out very good. My husband went back for 2nds and 3rds and doesn't normally like black-eyed peas.  I omitted the tomatoes and used fresh garlic which I crushed in a press. I also reduced the cooking time to 1 1/2 hours by soaking them over night. If you choose to soak them over night make sure to drain the water and rinse the peas. Then return to the pot with 4 cups water and remaining ingredients.

I modified the recipe by adding: nearly a cup of rice for a heartier meal, half a chopped bell pepper, and a sprinkling of parsley.  Also, we didn't have ham so I cut up some sausage for seasoning and added flavor.  I didn't soak the beans overnight--just used two cans of black eyed peas that were pre-soaked.  It really cut down on the prep time.  The recipe is excellent, and highly recommended!

I futzed with this one, and it turned out great. I started by boiling the beans separately while I sauteed the following together: bacon (to replace the ham), onions, garlic, 2 seeded and sliced jalapenos, and a palmful of sage leaves. Once that was soft I drained & rinsed the beans and added them to the pot. I added the canned tomatoes (roughly chopped) and covered with vegetable stock. That just simmered for about an hour (maybe less), and it turned out brilliantly. Coupled with cornbread, my fiancee had his first true southern meal this New Year's Day. Yum!

I rate this recipe a 4 because I had to add a lot of ingredients to it to make it my own.  We (my fiance and I), made a double batch, and we added 2 bell peppers, celery, basil, parsley, 4 bayleaves, and lots of Tony Satcherins seasoning.  It turned out absolutely amazing!!!!  I will be making this recipe every new years now.  We made "Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread" and "Famous Fried Cabbage", also from this site... and might I say... the whole meal was rated a ten!!!  Everyone raved!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

FANTASTIC - THESE ARE REALLY GOOD. I have used a recipe similar to this several times.  However, I did not add the tomatos during the cooking process. I have cooked black eyed peas for many years. I use to do the quick boil for 1 hour then drain method that is on the back of the package (I did not want to fool with the over night soak). The only things I changed were to use 1 1/4 lbs of black eye peas, 2 small/medium hamhocks (which were deboned and shredded after the cooking time)and 1-14 oz can petite cut tomatoes with garlic and olive oil.  I used all of the other recipe ingredients that are called for to taste. Great recipe.

My WHOLE famile LOVED this recipe! My husband was afraid to take a bite because he said he HATED black eyed peas, but he had TWO helping of this recipe! My 2 year old and 7 year old daughters loved it to! I did use two BIG ham hocks instead of chopped ham. WONDERFUL!

we had these for new year's dinner tonite. i usually made the plain old tradition peas, but my mother in law is on a strange diet due to medicine she's on, so she can't eat cured or smoked meat. (so much for ham seasonng) i saw this and thought it would be good since i couldn't use seasoning and left off the ham. it reminded me of something i'd had. there is a restaurant that has black eye pea soup and that was it. i did change the recipe to make it tastier. i added celery, bell pepper, jalapeno and 2 cans of tomatoes. (i didn't bother to crush them) also a little mixed pepper and cayenne. it was great.  thanks.

Quite tasty. I'm from the North and hubby is from the South. He has to have the black eyed peas on New Years. It's about the only time of year that I cook these. I made this recipe in the crock pot. I used 2-15 oz. cans of peas and 1- 15oz. can of diced tomatoes, both with their liquid and left out the water and the garlic(hubby isn't crazy about garlic). This was plenty of liquid to boil down a bit in the crock pot. Ham and tomatoes and the onions make it a bit more interesting than plain black eyed peas. Thanks

We also changed a few things.  We sauted the onions with some spices first and added some german sausage.  We then added diced tomatoes and fresh, crushed garlic.  We used 8 cups of water, thanks for the recommendation!  We couldn't imagine using the recommended amount!  We also used a vegetable bouillon cube with the water.  A splash of tabasco sauce and this was a hit!

My southern husband raved to his parents that his Yankee wife now makes black-eyed peas better than they do! I doubled the recipe so there would be leftovers, but everything was eaten up. It was delicious. Thanks Roxanna....you certainly brought good luck for the new year to our table!

I'm a firefighter and I decided to cook today and sticking to tradition we had black-eyed peas and cabbage.  This reciepe along with another fireman's pot of cabbage was a hit!!!  I followed the reciepe with just a few modifications.  I presoaked the peas for about 6 hours.  I crumbled up 7-8 leftover strips of bacon from breakfast and I used fresh garlic.  I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes and sprinkled a little cajun seasoning in for an added boost.  If I can do this anyone can.  LOL!  BRAVO

Every thing good about this dish, except, (unless it's me), I didn't get the measurements. It calls for 3 cups water, but later in description it says to fill 8 quart container 3/4 full. It takes more than 3 cups to do that, so I just filled up the pot 3/4 full and it had plenty of water to cook. I didn't soak overnight, just did as the recipe said. Another blunder I see was that it servered way over 6 servings. I would say it served 20!! And we took a couple of healpings.

This has become a yearly "must" serve on New Years Day.  I only use real garlic crushed, not powder and eliminated the tomatoes.  Very tastie!  Kids always hate it but I insist on one teaspoon bite for good luck for the new year.

I used two cans instead of dry beans. Also used a can of tomato sauce since I didn't have canned tomatoes. I also had leftover Honeybaked Ham, which added a nice sweetness. Best black-eyed peas ever!

These were the best black eyed peas anyone at our table of 12 have ever had!  Normally no one will eat but one bite, but many were going back for seconds, and even asked for some to take home!  Glad I tried this one!  It is actually quite similar to the way I make Pasta Fazul, an Italian soup.

Delicious.  I started with the (rinsed, sorted and soaked peas, a ham bone, 4 Bay leaves, one onion cut in 4 pieces and enough water to cover (about 6 cups) in the crockpot.  When peas were almost tender, I discarded bay leaves & onion & ham bones (after saving the meat, chopping, and returning to the pot). Then I added 1 cup raw brown rice, about 1/2 cup chopped green peppers, 1 finely chopped (and seeded) jalapeno pepper, 2 Tbsp minced garlic instead of the garlic powder, 2 Tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley, 1 Tbsp dried basi (didn't have any fresh), and the tomatoes. When rice was tender, my version of Hoppin' John was ready.

These are quite tasty but I do have a few changes. I like my peas to be an almost creamy texture so I omitted the tomatoes. I used one ham hock that I made several cuts into, half a link of smoked sausage, one onion, garlic powder, onion powder, chile sauce and chicken broth as the liquid. I let these simmer for a couple of hours and OH MY they are good!

This was really good! I used 6 cups of water instead of 3 and during the last 30 min of cooking I added a cup of okra and a little hot sauce. Served with corn bread. Yummy!

Great basic recipe for black-eyed peas.  For those who say it's bland, try adding your own ingredients to jazz it up.  To speed things up, I used 3 cans of black eyed peas, 1 can of diced tomatoes (did not puree) and simmered all ingredients for about 20 minutes.  I also started out by frying 6 slices of apple smoked bacon and sauted the onion in the grease.  I only used 1/2 an onion because that's all I had and it was just fine.  I used all the bacon drippings and added the bacon to the 2 cups of chopped ham and it was delicious.  Probably don't need that much bacon grease though :).  Will definitely make this again next year.

Next time I will soak my beans overnight because they took forever to soften up.  But once they did, yummy!  I had left over pork loin that I threw in instead of ham and that worked great.  Happy New Year!

Pretty much a traditional recipe. I'm from the south and my family always cooked/simmered the onion(s) and a piece of smoked shank together, w/water to cover of course, until the meat fell off. Adding a little crushed garlic, and fresh ground black pepper. After soaking the Peas, over night or quick method, rinse and add to onion/shank broth. Simmer on back of stove while fixing rest of meal. NO TOMATOES...YUCH. Add salt if needed and serve with rice and corn bread. Yum!

Happy New Year! I borrowed from "2BCreative" by soaking overnight (a must in my opinion for dried beans), only using 4 cups of water, adding fresh garlic, & cooking for 1 1/2 hours. I used canned stewed tomatoes whirled in the blender. The result was a tad soupy, but we all had 2 bowls full! Served with my favorite cornbread recipe. I'm happy with this- it will be my standard New Year's recipe from now on!

I made this experimentally on New Year's Eve.  I used my husband and one of our friends as guinea pigs.  I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and filled the pot to cover the peas plus one inch above them, I used 3-4 crushed garlic cloves instead of powder, and I used three cans (drained) of black-eyed peas instead of dry but did not change the cooking time.  I made corn bread to go with this.  You can use a slotted spoon if you want more of a pea side dish or use a ladel and ladel the "soup" over your corn bread in a bowl.  This was absolutely fantastic either way you serve it!  Husband and friend gave rave reviews and insisted I serve the leftovers on New Year's Day.  I had quite a bit left over and since today is New Year's day, we'll have it again.  It's probably better the day after making it once the flavors really set in.  We're having people over for dinner and a football game so this will be GREAT!  Thanks Roxanna!

This was by far the worst direction provided for any recipe. Did anyone that has already rated this actually read the directions? It tells you to use a 8-quart pot and fill it ¾ full of water. That’s right 24 cups of water. This gives you SOUP. If you cut the amount of water down to 8 cups this will make a nice pot of peas.

Once I added herb seasonings and let it cook down, it turned out very good.  It seemed very bland up to that point.  When serving, I sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top and everyone enjoyed it!

Finally found a recipe to like black eyed peas! Normally can't stand them.  This was good.  I went back for seconds and thirds...  I can finally stop looking for a way to eat them with my family.

Tried this recipe today.  a little after New Years but better late than never.  Basic recipe was a little bland.  Added a bay leaf, some creole seasoning and 1 can of chicken broth.  this helped.

This is a 5 star recipe that is easily tweaked to make it perfect for your family.  Until now, I've only ever taken a spoonful of black-eyed peas on New Years (just in case there really is something to the good luck tradition).  However, I'm eating these peas regularly now.  Following this recipe produces a great dish.  Tweaked for my taste buds and to keep it quick and easy, I used 1 undrained (15.5 oz) can of Goya BlackEyed Peas, 1/2 of a 16 oz package of Eckridge Smoked Sausage,  1 (14.5 oz) can of DelMonte Diced Tomatoes with Garlic & Onion, and 1 medium green pepper, chopped.  I simmered these ingredients for 5 minutes, then served over Uncle Ben's Ready Rice Whole Grain Brown which cooks in the microwave in 90 minutes.  Deelish!!!

I hadn't ever done the whole NY black-eyed peas thing but figured I'd give it a shot - these were good!  Because we aren't able to get ham (Saudi Arabia) I did substitute chicken... and made it more like a soup by adding some chicken bullion/water and cilantro.  Used can of chopped tomatoes too and I can rarely be bothered to soak beans so used a couple cans of beans and it was a good quick meal.  Kids loved it to so maybe it will become a new tradition... assuming we find the black-eyed peas again next year!

This turned out surprisingly well, especially with a few changes and additions. Soaked the beans overnight and drain. Used crumbled bacon (14 strips) instead of ham. Used 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper and omitted the salt due to using canned beef broth. Added 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke. Added 1/2 tsp. dried basil, few shakes of dried parsley and 1 bay leaf. I needed only 4 cups liquid (14.5 oz can beef broth and 1 1/2 cans of water instead of the ridiculous amount of water called for the recipe. Used minced garlic  instead of powder. Used dried minced onions. Used Italian diced tomatoes and didn't puree them. Turned out AMAZING!!

I wanted to rate this four stars instead of five because it did need alot of tweeking.I rated it five because I don't want anyone to pass it by. I took the suggestions of others who rated the recipe and made the following changes. I used chicken broth instead of water and used about 8 cups, which is about half what the recipe called for. That amount would have been entirely too much. I used rotels (original).I used one onion instead of two,more garlic,and cajun seasoning to taste. I used diced ham but threw in a hamhock while cooking for flavor. It turned out wonderful.I made a pot for home and one for work.Alot of people don't like black-eyed peas, but everyone loved them. It's a must try!

Very good but needs some more flavor.  I used two cans of stock and two cans of black eyed peas instead of dried.  I didn't add quite as much ham, maybe only half.  The thing that did spice it up was a small can (I believe 8 oz.) of crushed tomatoes and chili peppers.(The kind you would put in a salsa)  It added quite a zing but was delicious.  I used that instead of the whole tomatoes.  Kept the onions, too.  It was still a bit "soupy" but was good.  Definitely needed corn bread as others suggested.  Made it with Golden Sweet Cornbread from this site.  Very good meal.  Thanks!

I've been making black eyed peas for years and never thought of using tomato in the recipe.  I used a can of Petite Diced Tomato with onions and garlic and I always soak my beans overnight.  They plumped beautifully and withstood my stirring and checking and sampling.  I will use this recipe from now on!

I too made this recipe today for my Southern husband (I am from the North) who praised them again and again (very picky so I had to blend up tomatoes and cut onions very small).  I followed this recipe exactly and it came out beautifully.  We liked it a little soupy; just remove with a slotted spoon and served over white rice with a little hot sauce and mini cornbread muffins.  I also made smokey links with barbeque sauce in the crockpot to accompany. Very good and we will enjoy the few leftovers tomorrow.  Have added this recipe to my recipe box on this site and will definitely make this again.

These peas are fantastic!  I've never made black eye peas before because honestly every time I've eaten them, I really haven't cared for them.  My husband however  loves them and has asked me many times to make them.  Black eye peas being a southern New Year's menu tradition for luck, and me wanting to do something for just him decided to try this recipe.   I have to admit they taste fabulous!  The only thing I would change is the amount of water, it was too much.  Don't get me wrong, the flavor of this pot liquor will be fantastic with a monster pan of cornbread, but it was still too much.  I will use this recipe again, and I will also be eating black eye peas again.   Great recipe!

I cheated and used frozen black-eyed peas. I also used less ham, fresh garlic and shallots instead of onions. I LOVED the addition of tomatoes. I'm usually not a big fan of black-eyed peas but make them because it's a New Year's tradition, but this recipe made them the best thing on our plates!

I don't even like black-eyed peas, but I loved these!  Only thing I did different was used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles to add a little spice.  I didn't blend them.  AWESOME PEAS!  Next time will make with corn bread.

This was a great recipe, I have another Black-Eyed Peas recipe that my husband likes better though due to his love of spicy food...Instead of ham, try Jimmy Dean spicy breakfast sausage and rotel with the black-eyed peas.

Maybe it's just me but I did not like the tomatos added to this dish. I guess I prefer the southern style.

HAPPY NEW YEAR!  Liked the idea of adding canned tomatoes in this recipe.  It was more soupy than my old recipe but was a nice change and didn't dilute from the flavor.  Only change made was to add a few dashes of liquid smoke.  My kids say it makes it taste like I cooked it over a fire all day.  Thank you for sharing.

DELICIOUS !!! If eating these peas doesn't bring me luck this year I don't know what will...  I only made a few changes: I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of liquefying a can of whole ones, substituted a tsp. of minced garlic for the powder, and used one onion instead of two.  We ate these with barbequed ribs but the peas were a meal in themselves. Next time we will just have some rice on the side...  This recipe helped me create an awesome New Year's tradition in my house!!!

This was sooo good.  I added a bag of frozen green beans and some peppers for color, and at the end I added some balsamic vinegar cuz I was too lazy to think about individual seasonings.  Everyone loved it. 13yo son -"you should make this more often. " He never says that.
Made corn bread and collard greens as well, poured leftover greens,  ham hock meat and pot liquor into Peas, and next day leftovers were heavenly.
I was happily surprised with how awesome this dish was. THANK YOU!

I halved the recipe, added more ham, and used a can of Rotel tomatoes. It was very good! I personally enjoyed the kick that the tomatoes gave it, but everyone may not like that.

This was really tasty. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of using fresh, minced garlic instead of powder. Also, I added a can of Rotel, which gave it some zip. This turned out very soup-y. I think next time I will use less water so the end result is a little thicker.

These were so delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I subbed minced, fresh garlic for garlic powder. I also added a few dashes of cayenne. Other than that, I followed exactly. I love that it calls for ham, as I had some leftover Christmas ham that needed to be used. I soaked the peas for 6 hours in cold water before cooking, and they only took about 45 minutes to cook. Happy New Year!

I love this recipe . Of course I made a few modifications to it (any good cook would) I used a left over ham bone and did not use tomatoes. Placed in a slow cooker covered with plenty of water and used the other ingredients. Cooked for 4 hrs then mashed some of the beans to thicken. Served over rice and Topped with green onion !

These were very easy to put together.  They tasted rather bland until I added the hot sauce.  But I let each person do their own and that was fine.  Will definitely make again.  Even if it isn't New Years.

My husband, who usually doesn't like black-eyed peas, ate 3 helpings! We loved this recipe. I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chicken broth replacing some of the water. Definitely a keeper!

I made this tonight with the thought that it might taste better the second day.  It actually tastes VERY GOOD tonight...can't wait to eat it tomorrow.  I would give it 5 stars but I had to make some modifications due to what I had on hand.  I used 2 cans of rinsed black eyed peas (what husband brought home one day last week), about a cup of dry vermouth for flavor (didn't want to use chicken or beef stock for the "luck" reasons stated by a previous reviewer...I obviously used canned peas, though), 5 cloves of garlic, over 2 cups of cubed smoked ham steak, a fair amount of Cajun seasoning, about 4oz of diced green chilies, and about a 1/2c of ham drippings from the Christmas ham for added pork flavor.  I used diced tomatoes and did not puree them.  I also did not add any additional water.  Again, we are looking forward to eating it tomorrow.  Thank you for the recipe.

I love this recipe!  I make it around 7:00 pm on New Year's Eve and then let it simmer for about 3 hours.  It's my breakfast for New Year's Day and usualy my dinner too.  I sometimes make cornbread to go with it.  We love it and it's so easy!

Simple and delicious.  I cheated and used two cans of black eyed peas instead of the fresh, and used beef brith instead of water.  I threw everything into a pot and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Came out perfect!

There wasn't much flavor in this recipe. Maybe instead of using water to fill the pot, you should use chicken broth, or bouillon cubes.

Didn't love this recipe.  Way too much water and the addition of the tomatoes tasted weird.  I'll stick with my stand-by of the bag recipe.

When i initially made this, i didn't care for it (way too much water, and a bit more onions than i like). However, the next day i had some for lunch cold from the fridge and it was soo good! I was actually craving it for days after. Cold is the way to go!!

I've never liked black-eyed peas and made these for New Year's Day, and can't get enough of them!!  I think I may have overcooked them a little, but still unbelievably good!!!  The only changes I made was use bacon instead of ham (because it's what I had) and added some jalapeno sauce to spice it up a little.

This recipe was very tasty after tweaking it. I would recommend using only 4 1/2 - 5 cups of water per lb. of peas. I also used a beef boullion cube in addition to the ham and onions but did not use the tomatoes.

First time I've eaten black eyed peas at New Year's and liked them!  In fact, we ran out of peas and didn't have the usual uneaten leftovers.  I'm not a fan of black eyed peas, but this time I enjoyed them.  I didn't add the tomato because of our own tastes, but still great. Thanks for a great recipe!

It was good.  I tweaked it the second time and added chopped bell pepper and celery to the onions, sauteed them in oil, then added the drained, cooked beans and ham.  I then poured tomato juice over it instead of blending tomatoes, and used fresh garlic instead of powder. I then added some creole seasonings to taste.  Really good over rice and with sour cream, chopped green onions, shredded cheese and corn muffins on the side.

This recipie is a great starter but I used MUCH less water, fresh Garlic (not powder), and personally, I like to soak overnight or par boil the peas before I cook 'em.

My husband is from the South and wants black-eyed peas every year and I never knew how to make them (except from a can!).  He LOVED these and said he could eat them every day.  I even liked them and I'm not fond of black-eyed peas, so easy, too!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for New Year's Day and it was put up against my mother's traditional black eyed peas, and these had rave reviews.  The leftovers are even better after being in the refrigerator after a day or two and eaten with cornbread.  I'll definitely make these again in place of my usual red beans.

Ok, so I combined this recipe with the one for black-eyed pea chowder. I was making blackened tuna, and wanted to continue the Southern theme. Apart from adding a little garlic and more salt, I stuck to both recipes, and the result was GOOD! This is hearty, tasty and healthy. An excellent side-dish. Thank you yet again!

I fixed this recipe on New Year's day and received rave reviews from a group of people all claiming to hate black-eyed peas.  Everyone planned only to have 3 peas, and before everyone left, the pot was almost gone.  This recipe is definately a keeper.  The only ingredient alteration that was made was that I used Rotel tomatoes instead of regular.

If you watched your mom make black-eyed peas for New Year's when you were a kid but never learned how, this is a great starter recipe. If you follow "as is", you will get a great result. I have been using this recipe for several years and never gone wrong except for one thing. My mom always used ham hock to help season the beans,so I used ham hock as well but have never felt like my beans were actually GETTING the benefit of the ham hock flavor (I was just adding it to the pot, nothing special). THIS YEAR I decided to try something different. I actually scored the ham hock and then boiled them on their own in water until tender (a couple of hours). I then reduced the ham hock water, let it cool (I made the stock the day before since I had to soak the beans anyway) and then used the ham hock water to cook the beans. OMG! What a difference! I then add my other seasonings toward the middle of the cook, instead of the beginning (especially salt since the ham adds saltiness) and added the ham hock meat back in to heat just before serving. After several years of making these, using these tweaks yielded the best black-eyes peas I have ever made. EVERYONE (including my children) devoured them!

I am a HUGE soup person.  Could eat soup once a day!  This is one of the best soups I have made, and it passed the hubby test, too.  I only made a couple of additions - 2 stalks celery, 2 med carrots diced.  I used the ham hock from our Christmas dinner and did not need to add salt, as the ham was perfect.  I will be adding this soup to my permanent soup section of my cookbook.

The only major change I made to this was I used smoked ham hocks, which I cooked for an hour just covered in water, instead of cook ham. Next time I will try the petite diced tomatoes as the regular diced was a little too big. Cooked the onion and a couple of cloves of garlic in a saute pan before adding to the broth. I did strain the fat from the broth (Thank God for my Oxo fat separator!). Added everything to the pot along with a 1/2 tsp of my Dad's creole seasoning.  Did need to add some salt at the end of cooking. Since I soaked the peas overnight, I cooked this for about 5 hours on low with the lid slightly off for the extra liquid to evaporate.

Terrific recipe.  Everyone liked it. I used a smoked ham hock instead of the chopped cooked ham. I used 2 minced cloves of fresh garlic. I used a can of Original Rotel Tomatoes and Peppers, with the juice, just straight from the can instead of pureed tomatoes. I put all the ingredients into a 5 quart pot, and then added water to a depth 1 inch above  the ingredients.  Then I brought it to a boil, and reduced to simmer for about 2 and one half hours. The black-eyed peas were dried, but quite fresh.

In the past I have not been a fan of Black-Eyed Peas.  I made this on New Years Day for an extended family dinner.  I followed the recipe and they turned out awesome.  Even family members like myself, who do not like black-eyed peas, liked this recipe.  Wonderful...

Okay, this was just fantastic and was a huge hit by my family and relatives.  I made just a few changes.  First, I added two cups of cooked chicken and spinach sausage to make it with less fat.  Then, I used two vegetable broth cubes.  I will most likely make this again because this recipe was simply wonderful!!

I used this as more of a base recipe because I discovered I didn't have some of the ingredients. I ended up using 1 can of black-eyed peas, 1 can of great northern beans, and 2 cans of stewed tomatoes. I pureed 1 can and left the other chunky. Put this all in my crockpot with the chopped ham, adding a hamhock as well for more flavor. I also added 2 cloves of garlic (chopped). Cooked on low for 5 hours. My fiance LOVED this. I obviously changed things a bit, but thank you SO much for the recipe or I wouldn't have had a clue what to do with black-eyed peas. :)

My husband hasn't had black eyed peas since he was a kid growing up in Mississippi so he was very exited about this. For a more traditional taste I left out the tomatoes. I used 10 pieces of bacon instead of ham. I added extra fresh ground black peppercorn and cajun seasoning. I also used 1 14 oz can of chicken broth and about 2 cans of water instead of the amount of water called for in the recipe. I used 1 med onion which was plenty. I wasn't thrilled about the taste in general but my husband just LOVED this dish. He said they were perfect. Next time I would use ham as called for instead of bacon for more flavor. I made cornbread with this which he mixed right in and said was delicious. I did also soak the beans for about 8 hours prior to cooking which did not change the cooking time

Really good recipe. I soaked the black eyed peas over night. I am from the south so I started with a roux. I just added an 1/8 of a cup of flour to the oil. Got it to a nice brown over medium heat. Then added onions. I used fresh garlic, about 2 cloved minced. Added ham, added some water slowly then peas also a bone from the left over ham I used. I didn't have whole tomatos so I used a can of diced. We like the tomato chunk so I didn't liquify them. Oh yeah, lot's of fresh cracked pepper! It was really good. Thank for the recipe.

I still haven't met anyone who actually likes Black Eyed Peas but everyone at the party ate at least a bowl of these and seemed to like them. I thought the flavor was rich and was impressed by the ease of preparation.

I brought these over to my mother's on new Year's Day in keeping with tradition and they were a big hit.  I too soaked the beans over night first.  I didn't have any leftover ham around so I got 6/10 lb. of thick sliced ham at the deli counter which was just shy of 2 cups.  I used 1 large shallot and 1 small/medium sized onion instead of 2 onions (that's what was in the pantry).  I had about 1 1/2 cup of chicken stock leftover in the fridge and used that in place of some water and sprinkled in some cayenne pepper.  I think next time I will try not pureeing the tomatoes, adding less water, add 1 or 2 chopped carrots and possibly some green peas just before serving.  I think I will also try them in the crockpot.

This was my first time to cook black-eyed peas, and my husband (who doesn't like black-eyed peas) loved it!  I added two cans of un-pureed Rotel tomatoes for spice.  I'll cook this again...and not just on New Year's Day!

I have acquired several bags of blackeyed peas, and I've been looking for ways to use them. For this dish, I doubled the recipe, presoaked my peas, and reduced the water (just enough to cover). I found the flavor lacking, so I added some Creole seasoning and a little barbecue sauce and brown sugar, so the end result was very similar to baked beans, only spicier. This dish was pretty good, though not quite as good as "real" baked beans. It is, however, a good way to use up extra blackeyed peas. I rated it a 3 because the recipe did require quite a bit of tweaking (especially with regard to water content) in order to yield good results.

i substituted a smoked turkey leg for the ham, added a chopped green pepper, and omitted the tomatoes.  i also followed the  water directions indicated on the package of the peas... it was pretty tasty and it freezes well.

a very nice simple recipe for black eyed peas.  i have to agree that the water amount is a bit off, but i had started this quite early so i just let it boil down.  i think the northerners have to remember, black eyed peas is a simple recipes.  sometimes you just throw a ham hock in or a bell pepper, but it's not a dish with huge tastes.

These were the best black eyed peas I've had. The only change I made to the recipe was to use petite diced tomatoes and plenty of real garlic.

Please! Dont add the powder! Use real Garlic...and the tomatoes have to much acid for me, so I use a tiny bit of brown sugar mixed in..not much. or use a bit of orange juice from a fresh orange..not much.

These are excellent.  My family loved them, including my toddler son. I added more pepper and salt to my serving though because I found it to be a little bland. Next time I don't think I'll puree the tomatoes. This time I added a little rice at the end to make it more like Hoppin John, and I also added some bell pepper and celery.

This was great, although I must admit I definitely changed things up because of what I had on hand.  I used three cans of black-eyed peas (two plain and one jalapeno).  For the tomatoes I used one can of whole tomatoes prepared as in the recipe and one can of diced with onions/garlic.  Used one big onion and about 2 cups of cooked ham.  Not sure how much water I added but I filled the 8qt pot to a little over half full.  After boiling I covered and simmered for about two hours - turned out awesome!  It cooked down a to a great consistency, not too soupy but also not mush.  Thanks for providing the starting recipe!

Nice idea to add tomatoes in the cooking pot, but way too much water was called for here and it became a soup instead of beans. There was no need to cook this 3 hours. Blackeyed peas straight from the bag cook nicely in 45 minutes, and all nutrition is lost if cooked too long. Sugar added to this recipe salvaged it from total loss.  I'm going back to my traditional pot of blackeyed peas cooked to perfection in one hour barely covered with water, then mixed with brown rice and stewed tomatoes for complete nutrition (full amino acid chain) and REAL Southern cooking.

Very Good, but needed "spicing up"; we used 2 cans Rotel (drained) & 1 tbls garlic salt instead of canned tomatoes & garlic powder. Plus 2 chopped jalapenos, & only 1 cup chopped ham.

We didn't even eat it.  After tasting it we opted to go to a restaurant for New Years dinner.  Hope this doesn't mean we'll have bad luck in 2004 but there is no way I could have eaten any more of this stuff no matter how much good luck it was supposed to bring.

My husband and father went in for seconds — mind you this is the same husband that stated for days how he does not like black eye peas — ever. It was his idea to substitute the ham for bacon. We had ham for Christmas and were over it. We used 2 cans of hot Rotel tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes. The kids liked it too, but too spicy for the girls. Oh yeah — the husband wouldn’t let me dump what was left because he wants to revisit them today. Great recipe! Easy too

Will make again. First time I really enjoyed eating Black-Eyed Peas. I rinsed, soaked overnight, rinsed again and started cooking peas. I added veggie base to 8 cups water and after cooking about 45 minutes I followed someone else's suggestion to drain and rinse them again. Then I added fried bacon and onions cooked with the bacon, garlic and Rotel that was blended. I also added water and two beef bouillon cubes. Then cooked another hour and 1/2. Everyone enjoyed and the peas did not have the typical earthy flavor I experience with everyone else's peas I have tried.

I've now made this recipe several times and it's perfect for New Year's Day; this year, I had to use a bean mix as the store was sold out of black eyed peas! But as is, it's a great recipe; thank you.

I followed the recipe as given in the video. I used the ham bone from a smoked ham. I did not have a can of regular whole tomatoes, but I used a can of stewed tomatoes with Mexican seasoning. It worked out really well.

These were awesome! I had to use canned peas since we don't have dried in my very small town in Ontario. I added extra garlic, some ground bay leaves and red chilis. I added the tomates and just mashed them up with the potato masher so they weren' too pureed. I then added my ham and water and about 1cup of water. I also added a tbsp of bacon fat. Simmered on the stove for a few hours and served over rice. Delicious and easy, I will definitely make this again. Do I have to save it for just new year's though, I could eat this once a week!

I used beans that I soaked overnight...added some celery, couple minced carrots, green pepper and 2 bay leaves.  They were great and even better the next day.

This came out absolutely perfect:)  I DID cheat and use canned black eyed peas, only because I wanted to have them for New Years Eve dinner.  I am from the South, and this was a staple NYE required food.  Since moving to Quebec, I missed cooking them last year, but this will be my yearly recipe from now on:)  Thank youuuu!!!!

This is definately a keeper! I soaked the peas overnight and thanks to another review, I used 4 cups of water.  I also added about 8 shakes (maybe 2 tbls) of Franks Red Hot to give it some pizazz. This was my wifes first taste of black eyed peas and she said "you're onto something."  It's all good.

This recipe is great!! I had never made black-eyed peas before and thought I'd give it a try for some good luck this new year, and I'm glad I did!! I did make some very minor changes: I just chopped up a can of whole tomatoes as I didn't want to have to clean my food processor. :) I threw in a ham hock in place of the chopped ham and I found it gave the soup a great smoked flavor and yielded some meat I chopped and added later. Instead of using any chicken stock, I just covered the beans with water and threw in 3 chicken boullion cubes. I also like mine with a couple of dashes of Tobasco. Anyway, it turned out fantastic with it being low in calories, this will definitely be one I make over and over again!!

my husband does not like black eyed peas, so I was trying to find something that he might eat for New Year's Day.  He loved this!!  I took the short cut and used 2 cans of peas, one had bacon with it.  I sauteed the onions and ham in a small amount of bacon grease then added everything else....also used diced tomatoes.  I will make this again and again.

Delicious!  I made this for dinner today with cornbread & coleslaw.  Yum, yum.  This is good also with rice.  I didn't use canned tomatoes, I just chopped up one of my husband's fresh tomatoes.(I live in Fla.)  Great recipe !

Great flavor, but our FRESH peas were tough.  Not sure why, but we also added diced and seeded jalapeno for extra flavor.

I love black eyed peas but had never made them before and had no idea where to begin. I used what I had at home so this recipe was more an inspiration than exact but they came out great! My changes: I used frozen peas; only 1 onion; minced garlic instead of garlic powder; turkey bacon instead of ham; chicken broth instead of water; half can of tomatoes - with mild peppers - instead of a whole can (I also didn't puree them). I served this over brown rice and both my picky boyfriend and I absolutely loved it! Not traditional but perfect on a cold winter day. I'm definitely adding this to the rotation.

Went by the recipe and tasted as I cooked.  It was VERY bland so I added a beef bouillon cube and a bay leaf.  I will buy some creole seasoning to try next time and maybe some bacon.  My husband really liked it and for black eyed peas this was pretty good.

The recipe itself is a decent one, but I found out that I don't care for the taste of black-eyed peas. I threw the ingredients into a slow cooker (which I left going for most of the day), and instead of pureeing a can of tomatoes I just added diced tomatoes.

Good recipe but I had to spice it up. Used Rotel, a big ham bone, part chicken broth/part water, fresh garlic & other spices. Cooked in crock pot for 10 hours. Turned out great.

Delish! Used dried onions, as my kids shot all my cooking onions off in the potato canon.  Also used chicken broth rather than water... and added some red pepper flakes. I soaked the beans overnight, then rinsed and just covered with chicken broth to cook.  Added a little water as needed during cooking.  Left out the tomatoes entirely to get a more traditional flavor. But LOVED the dish.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a really good base recipe for blackeyed peas.  I took someone else suggestion and added Itlian diced tomatoes, 2 garlic cloves, seasoning salt, pepper and 7 slices of bacon crumbled.  All of the other ingredients I stuck with the recipe.  This was really good with the cabbage roll casserole and carrot souffle.

great recipe, thanks for sharing.  I like my food spicy and added lots of crushed garlic, 2 bay leaves and about 3/4 teaspoon chili pepper flakes.  I also used beef instead of pork and added chopped celery stalks about 10 minutes before the beans were done.

With a tiny bit of tweeking, this recipe is excellent.  Use fresh garlic in place of the powder, and make sure to add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful served over freshly baked cornbread!

Great recipe. This was a good way to use leftover ham from Christmas. I used fresh garlic instead of the powder and canned diced tomatoes instead of whole. Family loved it, a new family tradition.

What a way to start out the New Year!  I soaked the black-eyed peas overnight and then placed them in my slow cooker.  I added a can of rotel tomatoes and green chilis (I placed in food processor with tomatoes before adding to black-eyed peas) along with a few extra spices to add some kick.  We absolutely loved these and there weren't any leftovers.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is yummy!  I'm from Mississippi and have been served black eyed peas all of my life...but never like this.  (Don't tell my Mom).  I altered the recipe by using canned diced tomatoes that I kinda smashed up a little more with my fingers, frozen peas, one onion instead of two and only cooked everything for an hour or so.  My husband liked this also.  Will make again.

Excellent Recipe!  My husband doesn't even like Black-Eyed Peas but he loved them prepared this way.  The aroma that they filled the house with was mouthwatering.  I will definitely make this recipe again.
