This recipe is good. I changed it a little bit, and it came out delicious. I added 1/2 ts ginger powder and 1 ts cinnamon; also, I added 1/2 cup raisins to the batter and didn't sprinkle the muffins with chopped pecans. I also added more 2 Tbsp brown sugar instead of only 1/2 cup. But they came out delicious, My husband and I liked them and I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks.
