Awesome!!! So easy and so good! I did add a jalapeno pepper and left out the navy beans but it came out beyond my expectations.

Very good recipe, but a little too sweet for our taste.  Next time, I would only use 1/2 cup of brown sugar, maybe less.
*I only used 1 can of Dark Red Kidney Beans, but I would do that with any Chilli Con Carne recipe because we like more meat, less beans.
When it was just about ready to eat, I tasted it and decided to add 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper. Perfect!  I served it with Mexican Blend Cheese and diced onions on top, and warm corn bread, honey and butter.  It was delicious!
