Hi,

I am the author of this recipe. I had a change of last name..lol
Anyway I have lost my original name and can't get it back if I wanted to, I have tried to get them to give me my account back under my new name but so far no luck!
The reason I am writing is to let you guys know that this dish IS supposed to be served over white rice and yes by all means cut down on the curry if you like, I use 1 TBLSP.
I am so happy that most people have enjoyed this recipe! If you like something MUCH milder, try Lisa Adams chicken noodle casserole. Another thing about this recipe that I have started doing over time is not adding the crunchy onions until the last 5 minutes of baking time. I will get around to posting more recipes under my new name soon.
Thx again and Bon Appetit! 08-25-04

CUT PREP AND CLEANUP BY HALF! (But baking time is doubled to one hour). I used 2 heads raw broccoli florets (cut rather small) and placed them on the bottom. Then I cubed 2 pounds of raw chicken and placed it atop. The sauce went next; cover chicken well with sauce, then cover the PAN. I baked this for 30 minutes, then remove cover and added the cheese and onions and baked an additional half hour. I do agree that the onions make it, and I didn't even use the full amount. For our own tastes, I only added 1/2 a teaspoon of Madras curry powder, and it was plenty. BUT DO ADD about 2 Tbsp. fresh squeezed LEMON JUICE to the sauce. It really, really adds to the flavor! (If hesitant, mix a squeeze into a spoonful of the sauce--you'll see :) ) The cayenne is a great addition; I used full amount.

This recipe was excellent! My family has always enjoyed this dish but your additions of garlic, cayenne and onions really made a big difference.  In the past I'd used breadcrumbs on the cheese as a topping which are good--this is better. I generally don't like cayenne pepper but have to admit it made a big difference in the taste. NOTE: The amount of curry powder to add depends on the brand start with 1 1/2 teas and go up to as much as 2 Tablespoons depending on taste. I was shocked when I switched brands and found I needed to cut the curry amount down to a fourth.

The words out of my husband's mouth "this is so good, make this again." Made me feel great. I reduced the curry and cayenne pepper, reduced the mayo and added some sour cream. The soup mixture was a little thick so I added some milk to thin it out a little. LIke one reveiwer said, the onions make the recipe. I put onions on one side and left them off on the other side. Big mistake. You could definitely make this healthier. I will make this again for sure.

This dish is very salty (check out the sodium content!).  Using reduced salt products and replacing the garlic salt with a lesser amount of garlic powder helped.  The curry adds a terrific flavor but doesn't overpower the dish.  See my "meal idea" for suggested side dishes.

If I could give this more than five stars, I would.  This dish has become my husband's absolute favorite.  My whole family loves it, including my three preschool aged children.  Instead of mayonnaise, I use plain yogurt and it comes out just fine.  In fact, I prefer it with plain yogurt instead of mayo.  A quick and easy meal.  We eat it over rice.  Yum!

LOVED this recipe!  I didn't have the means to weigh out a pound of broccoli, but I didn't put in enough- this may just be the best way to eat broccoli, so don't skimp!  Next time I'll try two HEAPING cups and see how it is:)  Also, I added plain garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and omitted the extra salt all together.  This is definitely a new staple in my family!

Oh man, this was good! We love curry and cayenne so my gang got the best of both worlds. I actually added more curry than called for, but I wouldn't recommend it if you not a true curry lover. I used low salt soups and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. So delicious Lisa!

Yum! This was quite tasty, after reading so many reviews about too much curry, I cut it way back to 1 1 1/2 teaspoon. The dish was still good, but I will follow the author's suggestion next time and do a whole Tablespoon. I used regular McCormick curry, maybe it's milder than fancier kinds?

This was delicious!  I used leftover marinated turkey breasts that we had grilled a few days before.  Using Healthy Request soups did not compromise the flavor, which made me feel better about licking my fork clean:o)

I really like this recipe.  It is rich, delicious, and definitely has kick!!!  We serve over rice--I would never serve it alone. It's a great way to introduce your kids to new flavors, if they're not used to curry or the spiciness of cayenne.  We scale it down a bit because we don't need 10 servings, but I still use almost a pound of chicken and a head of broccoli, cut up and steamed beforehand.  The mayo I just about halve and I only use the cream of chicken soup(1 can).  I use 1/2tsp curry, a rounded 1/4tsp of cayenne and a little less than 1/2tsp of garlic salt.  Comes out great:)

I am the original submitter, please serve over white rice, please use only 1 TBLSP Curry to start with, the yellow common kind. Yes, this is my hubby's favorite as well! I usually leave out the cayenne or use less & I always SPRINKLE some curry/salt/pepper on the chicken as I fry it in butter as well...yum! Going to have to make it now! Also, I really think the Frenchs Fried Onions are very important to the recipe! I hope you will make sure to use them! Husbands really seem to love this recipe. I always check in and make sure the corrections above are viewable.

I have been making this recipe for the last 6 years.  It is delicious and one of my very favorite recipes on this site.  My hubby & sons are thrilled when I make this. Only thing I do differently is, I only use about a 1/4 c. of mayo.  For the people who gave this a bad review, you obviously don't know good, flavorful, comfort food.

My whole family loved this new favorite. Sometimes the young diners are the true test of a new recipe-our daughter pronounced that it "can't be a casserole, because she likes it!" Try it served over rice cooked in chicken broth rather than water.

This dish had great flavor but was really rich. Only alteration was that I added low fat sour cream a few minutes before serving over rice.

My husband said this was one of the best things I've ever made!  It was delicious!  I put all the cheese on the top instead of putting some in the "sauce" because I misread, but still delicious.  We both couldn't wait until lunch the next day to eat the left overs.  DELICIOUS!!!

Really good. Omitted curry since I had none on hand. I also added a pack of mushrooms and an onion that I sauteed in a lil olive oil first. I used fresh broccoli that I blanched first and left the chicken raw and cut into cubes. Chicken cooked in this casserole with no problem. Loved the crunchy onion topping! Family approved served with a tossed salad. Thanks!

This was the BEST Chicken Divan recipe I've ever had. My husband has decided to call it "Awesome Divan." Next time, we are going to add less cayenne pepper...because it was a little too spicy for us...but WOW. I can't say enough good things about this. I LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!

this would be a 5 star if it weren't for how terrible it is for you. I reduced the mayo to 3/4 cup, omitted one can of soup, reduced the cheese, and added a bit of nonfat milk to make up for it. Still delish! Next time I will reduce the mayo even further. Curry in chicken divan is genius!

This is my favorite meal! I first had a chicken divan casserole nearly identical to this one, when eating dinner at my mother in-laws. It became an instant favorite. To me it's just not chicken divan without the curry. I follow this recipe, except I use two teaspoons of curry and also I make a cup of white instant rice. I layer the rice in the bottom. It soaks up all the sauce and makes it more filling. Also I usually top with French's fried onions the last 5 minutes of cooking. Everyone always loves this!

I have been making this recipe for over 25 years, but with some variation.  I put a package of fine cooked noodles in the bottom of a greased cake pan. Then the broccoli and then the chicken.  If I am in a hurry I use a prepared chicken from the grocery.  I then mix together 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, 1 cup of mayo, 1 tablespoon of curry and 1 tablespoon lemon juice.  I spread this over the layers and top with 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  I bake covered for 1 hour. I let it sit for 5 mins. before serving and cut like lasagna.  It is always a hit.

This is quite good - a little like the recipe on this site for Chicken Casserole del Sol, but (frankly) easier.  I made this last night and didn't notice until just now that the recipe called for cooked broccoli.  I took two heads of raw broccoli, peeled the stems, chopped them up - not even that small, some of those florets were pretty big! - and threw them on top of the chicken.  Turned out great, actually; the broccoli was cooked just right, still slightly firm. I don't think I'd change a thing next time since I like my veggies with a little texture.  Other than that - omitted the French-fried onions and used crushed cornflakes instead, eyeballed the cheese on top (didn't use anywhere near the amount called for), used one can of reduced-fat soup and half reduced-fat mayo, and kept all of the spices the same.  We'll make this again!  Edit:  Also good with a pound of fresh mushrooms layered in with the chicken and broccoli.

I followed this recipe very loosely. I actually used four cups of shredded chicken and added one yellow onion and six ounces of cooked egg noodles to the mix. I also added a cup of sour cream and a 1/2 cup of white wine to the sauce, along with 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. I reduced the curry powder to 1 tablespoon and the cheddar to 1 cup. I put crushed saltine crackers mixed with melted butter in place of the french fried onions.

This was delicious and very easy to make.  I made this ahead of time and froze it.  Then, I put it in the oven to bring to temperature, and then finally served it for an all day football party.  This held up for hours and the taste was delicious.  The chicken stayed tender and the sauce stayed creamy!  Excellent!

This recipe was fantastic and even my boyfriend was very impressed!  I only used 1 tbsp. of curry and it tasted perfect.  I would consider cutting back on the curry and red pepper only for company or those that would not prefer a little zing.  I loved it so much that I couldn't help but to have a little bit of the leftovers for breakfast this morning :-) Thank you!!!

A nice change to the ordinary chicken divan.  The fried onions were a great addition!!  Very good recipe, I will definately make it again!

I absolutely loved this chicken recipe and so did both of my kids, who are extremely picky.  I only added a tablespoon of curry and I added some french fried onions to the sauce mixture before I poured it on top.  Then I finished it the way the recipe calls for.  This is probably the best chicken recipe I have ever had the pleasure of eating!!!

Loooooove this!!!! Serve with a glass of Ménage a Trois Moscato and it's pure perfection. I use light mayonnaise, reduced fat Mexican blend cheese, 2 tbsp of curry (huge fan) and also add red pepper flakes for some more spice. Absolutely divine :) thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!!!

I cut the recipe in half, for that reason I use 1 can of Campbell's cream of mushroom and chicken soup since it adds just the right flavor.  BE SURE to use curry, maybe not as much as stated, but start with just a little and you'll never want it without it again, it makes the whole dish come together.  Instead of dried onions for topping, I've used either crushed potato chips or Ritz crushed with melted butter.  You will never find a better recipe, thanks for sharing MRSADAMS - Lisa Brown!!!

This was a HUGE hit.  I cook for the homeless once a month and am always looking for quick easy TASTE recipes that I can make for 50 or more people.  When I saw curry I know I was going to get this a try, it was going to be just a little different.   It was so easy to make and it smelled wonderful.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.  We'll definately have it again and I'll be making it for my family this week.

I originally got this recipe from my sister.  Her recipe calls for a box of Uncle Bens Wild Rice, cooked as directed.  This is then the bottom layer of the casserole.  So yummy!

Tried 4 different divan recipes in order to use up some frozen leftover rotisserie chicken, this recipe turned out to be the lest palatable of all I attempted--can't imagine anyone thinking this was 5-star worthy.  Far too salty and spicy!

This was pretty good. I am not a huge fan of curry, so I didn't add as much but it ended up adding a unique flavor that everyone in my family appreciated. Thanks for the recipe!

YUM! I LOVED THIS!  The only things is that I would change 1 thing.  It needs more liquid. it was a bit dry for my taste. I would add about 1/2 c. milk next time.  I did use frozen broccoli- stired it in the pasta and water just before i drained it.  Also, didnt have the fried onions- so i used croutons-bread crumbs, garlic, salt and a touch of melted butter tossed together, then put on top.  YUM!  The fam LOVED IT!

I made this tonight for my fiance and me, I thought it was great, he didn't care too much for the broccoli in it though, so I think next time I'm going to leave it out and add big chunks of onion instead. I made a few changes I used cream of broccoli soup, yogurt in place of the mayo, added onions, and used frozen broccoli in butter from green giant. Overall was easy to make, & quick clean up. Will make again and try to tweak it to please my picky eating fiance. Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG! Family wants this 4 times a week now! Served over rice(made 4 cups and only use Calrose). Made just a few mods -
browned chicken in EVOO w/crushed garlic and chopped onions because we love both and instead of fresh broccoli which I didn't have on hand, I used a 16oz pkg of frozen normandy mix (broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. I make 10 servings for my family of 7 and there were NO left overs!!

Yummmmmmmm! Great recipe! I will definitely make this again. I read some reviews and scaled back on curry to 1 tbsp. This suited our tastes perfectly. Also left out the table salt since some reviews said it was too salty. I served over white rice. This is tasty comfort food. Loved it.

Ater this tonight and it was delicious.  I'm trying to cut out condensed soups from my cooking so I made a white sauce instead of the two cans of soup.  I also added a splash a lemon juice and only 1 1/2 tsp curry and topped with panko bread crumbs.  I made two pie plate size dishes and froze one.  Already looking forward to that freezer meal!

I've made various Chicken Divan recipes in the past and while this one is pretty true to the traditional recipe, it's definitely got a bit of zing (and crunch) that is added by the onions on top.  It's really delicious and my family is already asking when I am going to make it again!

This was AWESOME!!!  My 7 year old said it was THE BOMB!!!  I scaled it down to 4 servings, and all I did different was cook the cubed chicken in olive oil with minced garlic and some onion powder.  I also used sweet peas instead of broccoli.  It was AWESOME!!!!  She said she wants it again!

Mmmmm mmmm, this was so yummy! I did make a few changes, but this was so delicious. It will definitely be in my regular rotation. My Mom used to make this (although I didn't know what it was called), but this surpasses her version (sorry Mom!). I added a few squeezes of lemon juice & about 1/4c chicken broth to the sauce. The lemon juice added a great zing, and I liked it a little more "saucy" with the chicken broth. Also I didn't have french's onions so I used buttered ritz cracker crumbs. My whole family just loved this. Thanks for a great recipe!

Didn't have any curry but made as is otherwise. This was pretty good but I may have gone overboard on the cayenne pepper. Definitely had a kick! The onions definitely made this dish. Yum!

I love this! I like to serve it over rice. My mother-in-law really enjoyed the curry flavor. Don't buy the cheap store brand onions (I got great value from Walmart and they were bland) Thanks for the recipe!

OMG!OMG!OMG! This is soo good! Make it tonight for dinner. I followed the recipe exactly and it was not spicy at all! I did not add any salt..doesnt need it. This is so good, I cant get over it. YUM YUM YUM! I served over white rice. Next time I will add more chicken and broccoli. You can never have too much broccoli. This is so freaking good. Can you tell that we enjoyed it? Even my 2 year old loved it. I am just thinking how good it will taste tomorrow if there are any leftovers...YUM...

The mayo overshadowed the rest of the ingredients.  Next time I will add either half the mayo and thin it with milk/broth or substitute with yogurt and sour cream.

Wow! I like easy, and this was easy.  I used 1/2 the cheese (that was all I had) so I topped with only the french fried onions.  It Was Yumm-O!!  ;-)

Yummy and RICH!!!!  I added leftover turkey breast with my cooked chicken breast, used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup because I don't like the chicken pieces in cream of chicken soup, used half the amount of cayenne pepper for fear it would be too spicy on my sensitive tummy, didn't add the onions but added a lot more cheese on the top and to the sauce, and used my Braun hand held mixer to blend the sauce. I also baked for an hour.  I ate some when this was ready at half hour over rice.  There was water under the chicken, and the sauce(to me) didn't seem cooked enough as it hadn't made it's way to the bottom of the baking dish .  After an hour the sauce spread to the bottom of the dish and seemed to enhance the savoury flavors of the curry and cayenne. Again this is very good, and very rich!!

The best chicken divan recipe I've ever tried.  I followed the recipe but used more chicken than the recipe called for.  I serve over rice with a salad.

Rich, rich,  rich.  This recipe is wonderful but a little bit goes a long way.  I also cut down on curry because my husband doesn't like it and it was  enough.  I used low sodium  soups and it was still too salty.  I am going to try using the yogurt next time and see if that helps. I would still give it a 5.

Excellent dish.  I substituted low fat yogurt for mayo, and it turned out great.  It's a bit salty, so I will tweek it the next time I make it.

Curry flavor (which I adore) but a little strange.  Hearty and decent enough for a quick throw together when I happened upon it and had the ingredients available - I should have guessed it was a one dish after all!  Certainly not 'guest' worthy. 
 I will just make a good curry recipe next time.  
Thanks anyway, I was still full and content :)
For other reviewers who decided too much salt - try using real garlic?  It may work.

This was great!  I did cut way back on the curry powder as 1 1/2 Tbsp. seemed like a tremendous amount.  I also added a layer of brown rice cooked with chicken broth & mushrooms to the bottom of the casserole.  A very hearty & warming comfort food.

This recipie provided a nice twist to the usual dish.  Was just a tad heavy on the curry for our taste, buth the cayenne was very good, though we like it spicy.  I might tone that back a little when making for company.  Overall a very tasty and easy dish!

This chicken dish has great flavor.  I did eliminate the curry altogether.  My husband and I found that the cayenne pepper gave it a little too much of a kick.  Next time I will consider cutting the cayenne pepper in half, if not eliminate it altogether.  I will definitely make this again.

I left off the onions and used asparagus instead of broccoli, but the sauce was great. There were no leftovers at our house!

I altered this a bit by using less curry powder, no cayenne pepper and topping it with buttered cornflakes- and my whole family ate it.  My husband raves about his mom's Chicken Divan- and I think this is just as good (maybe even better!)  My little boy (15 mo) even gobbles this up everytime I make it.

I needed something quick and simple for two unexpected dinner guests and pulled this recipe up. It was absolutely delicious and  my guests thought I'd worked all day! I only used a sprinkle of curry powder however as my family is not too fond of it. The cayenne pepper really made the sauce flavorful.

My daughter loves this recipe, even though she detests mayo. I buy the bagged raw broccoli florets from Costco, sometimes cutting into more bite-sized pieces. I like my broccoli well cooked, so I line my baking dish with the florets and roast them in the oven at 400-degrees for 10  minutes or so. I also buy Costco’s cooked rotisserie chicken already skinned and pulled from the bone to cut down on prep time. Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly and serve over Jasmine rice. Always a big hit.

I love this recipe! I've been using it for years. I  use 1 1/2  teaspoons of curry and one less can of soup.  I also use half the mayo and substitute with sour cream. I know it sounds like I change it too much, the point is, even if you don't have the exact ingredients it's still great. The fried onions are a must.

I use 1 tbs of curry and a little bit less cayenne...and when I can I use leftover smoked chicken breast, which just adds a nice flavor. Our three kids (6, 8, and 14) all love it as well.

Love it!  I have made this several times by popular request. I personally really like curry and usually use 1 tablespoon of McCormick Medium Curry Powder. I have also used thawed frozen broccoli and added the fried onions during the last few minutes of cooking time.

Great on rice or noodles. I followed this recipe exactly the first time I prepared it and it was perfect - I was a little wary of so much curry, but my family loved it and I did too. I've prepared it several times since and have added even more curry. It works just as good with low fat mayonnaise and low sodium varieties of the soups. I like the French fried onions on top, though I've made it without them simply because I didn't have a can in the pantry, but the dish is tasty even without them on top.

I loved the curry and I loved the flavor of everything. Next time (and I will try this again, the flavor was too good) I'll reduce the fried onions and the mayo since they made everything so increadibly greasy and rich. However, I have to say that my boyfriend RAVED about this dish. So I guess if you love curry like we do and it you are able to look past the fat/grease content you will love it!

I have made this 10 or more times and always have requests for me to make again.  I serve it over basmati rice as it is not as heavy.  Thanks so much for putting this in my repetoire for busy nights.

Tried this last night, switched up chopped spinach instead of the broccoli and it turned out great.  Will not top with cheddar cheese again - way too salty.  Will try recipe again with mozzarella instead.

This was awesome! My whole family loved it. Only change I made was garlic powder instead of garlic salt and because I had leftover rice and it's not great reheated, I put it under the chicken and broccoli. It was fantastic!

Excellent recipe.  My wife thought it was amazing and wants me to make it all the time now.  I made one small change that turned out really well.  As we live in the UK now, it's hard to get french-fried onions, so I decided to make some onion bhajis with Pataks' bhaji mix and put those on top.  Turned out absolutely incredible, it's now an Indian casserole and we will definitely do this one again.

Delicious! And a nice spinoff from the chicken divan I have been making over the years. I did use low fat mayo to cut back on fat and calories. Next time I might use stuffing instead of the fried oninons to top like my chicken divan recipe call for.

This was yummy, and I didn't make too many changes but I do have some suggestions.  With 2 cans of creamed soups and the large baking dish, I felt only 2 C. of cooked chicken and 1 lb. of broccoli weren't nearly enough -- so I used 3 C. of chicken and lots more broccoli. The soups were too "thick" as is, so I added 1/2 C. of Dry Vermouth to the mix (I would have used dry sherry but didn't have any).  Used 1 T. curry powder, which was perfect (maybe even less next time), 1/4 tsp. cayenne, 1/4 tsp. white pepper, garlic powder, 1/2 C. lite mayo and 1/2 C. lite sour cream.  Leftovers are really delish.  *****As a side note, in 2004 when the author added this recipe to the site, it was probably an economical casserole dish.  But in 2012, it was rather expensive to make with the French's canned onions, cheese, soups, mayo, etc.

My husband muct have told me 5 or 6 times during dinner how much he loved this dish and he spcifically asked me not to lose this one. I made it as directed but left out the onions. I didn;t have them and i am not a huge fan of them and it was still wonderful. It is not a healthy recipe by far but i will make it in the future....just not often due to health concerns. Thanks for the recipe Lisa!

Absolutely loved this recipe, have made it several times since I ran across it. The only thing I did differently is I used a bag of the frozen stir fry vegetables instead of the broccoli. Yummo

I liked this a lot, but I would start out with less cayenne unless you like the kick. Not quick the flavor of my mom's version, but I really enjoyed the curry flavor. I also sauteed mushrooms before layering them into the dish before the broccoli. I might add more quantities of veggies next time. NOM!

This is a recipe that I grew up with in the 70's and 80's that my mother would make every year with left over turkey. It was my favorite part of Thanksgiving. She used cream of celery instead of the cream of mushroom, and Pepperidge Farm dry stuffing mix, mixed with melted butter to top it off.

Receipe was really good, curry was a bit overpowering but next time I will cut back a bit on it.  Also instead of cubing the chicken, I buy the thin chicken breast tenders and leave them whole.

Very good! i did not use the curry or cayenne. Also instead of 1 cup of mayo, I divided it into 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. I served with egg noodles, delicious!

I will definitely make this again. I thought 1 1/2 TBS. of curry sounded like a lot, so I only added 2 tsp. The sauce didn't really pour over the mixture. I had to spread it. I probably used more chicken and broccoli. Next time I would add some milk to make it more saucy.  Loved it. Ate it the next day as leftover and it was great.

I too halved the mayo and curry and thought it was great and easy. I would start off with 1 tsp of curry and add to your taste. I made two of these at once to also take someone in need of a meal. Just provide some uncooked rice in a baggie and they have a great casserole for dinner. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe!  I agree with everyone else, the onions really make this recipe.  I'm having company for dinner soon, and I've decided that this is what we're going to have!  This is now my go-to chicken divan recipe.

This is an awesome recipe I make is all the time. I do add 1/2 tsp of tumeric to it and makes is a bit more spicy. I make a side of basmati rice and add butter, Cinnamon and cumin to it. The sweetness of rice and the spiciness of this dish, makes one great experience.

Really good- I've also done it with frozen chopped broccoli and monterey jack instead of cheddar. I've also subbed peas. Good either way. We like curry, so I'm generous with that. Serve over white rice and yum!

This was so good.I even put some cold on a salad today and it was fantastic. I used 1 tblsp curry powder and omitted the salt and used low sodium soups. The onions make it! I only bought one can by mistake but they were awesome. And i added then the last five minutes. Had the Chardonnay too and was incredible.

We liked this recipe. The changes I made helped though. I added peas rather than the broccoli, and nearly doubled the curry powder. I also used half sour cream instead of mayo but that was to use up what I had in the fridge. I didn't have the proper amount of cheddar but it was still very tasty with out it. I'll make this again...it's hard to please everyone in the house and this one did the trick.

We love this dish on white rice. Just as good with more broccoli, more soup, or more chicken if you have less of one main ingredient. One 3 oz package of French-fried onions covers our 10x13" pan well enough. Feeds our family of five with a week of leftover lunches for me.

Well, I have mixed emotions about this one.  I followed the suggestion of using less curry (1 TBSP) and less cayenne (1/4 tsp) and I'm glad I did.  The heat from the cayenne was just right, but the curry was still a bit much for me.   THIS IS VERY SALTY, next time I would use 1/4 tsp garlic POWDER and no garlic salt.  The rice helped cut the saltiness a bit.  It was quite pungent and rich.  I "sort of" enjoyed it, my husband on the other hand LOVED IT and keeps raving about it. He said he'd even like it just with broccoli.  So the bottom line is, the idea is great, but this recipe is overwhelming to me; I'd have to make a few more changes next time.

This was my favorite childhood dish and I was thrilled to find it again. I would say that the recipe asks for WAY too much curry (and I love curry and spicy food). Other than that, it tastes great.

I really liked the french fried onions.  Not too crazy about the curry in this dish, but it was alright.  Probably will just omit the curry next time.  Overall, pretty good.

I really enjoyed this recipe and chose it for the kick given by the cayanne.  I cut the cayanne in half because I have very hot cayanne (90,0000 HUs).  I added fresh garlic and lemon juice.  Also when I added my brocoli, I added it raw because I do not like overcooked mush.  The brocoli was cook with just the right amount of bite.  It was excellent.

I have made many versions of chicken divan and this one was awesome.  The touch of cayenne pepper was great.  I did use garlic powder instead of salt because of the sodium and used low fat soups.  Add a little fresh squeeze of lemon juice to the soup mixture which really enhances all the flavors.  If you are not a huge fan of curry this is not the dish for you.

We liked this a lot. I used leftover chicken that had been prepared with curry and I cut down on both the curry (used 1/2 tbs) and cayenne (used 1/4 tsp) and it was the perfect amount of spice for us. I used frozen broccoli that I thawed, rinsed, and patted dry with no problems. I also made a Persian rice (called Ketah I think) to make it more authentic. Thanks for sharing, it was really tasty.

As far as my family is concerned this one of the best! I use only 1 tbsp curry as 1-1/2 is way too overpowering. Other than that the recipe is perfect. Every guest I've served it to requests the recipe as well. This one is a keeper!

Very good.  A little salty but I didn't use sodium free soups or anything like that although I did leave out the garlic salt and just used fresh garlic.  I threw TONS of raw broccoli on the bottom of the pan, fresh mushrooms (jeez when do I not add mushrooms?) and we just had a tiny bit of leftover rotisserie chicken so I threw that in there and poured the sauce on top.  I think I baked it a little bit longer than it said to but still easier than pre-cooking the broccoli.

Great Recipe !!! I used yogurt for mayo as others indicated and also used healthy request soups.  This is a great dish that I will make on a regular basis

This was very good! Served it over white rice and used cracker crumbs instead of crunchy onions. Will definitely make again.

My family absolutely loved this dish and it was so easy to prepare!  Even my pickest eater loved it!  Next time I will put in a little less cayenne pepper (for the kids sake), but wouldn't change anything else.

Excellent for what it is -- a quick, soup-based casserole.  A little on the spicy side, and I found it salty.  Other than that, will definitely be making this again!

Loved it ! I'll make it again. I modified the recipe to make it a little healthier. Used light mayo, non-fat cheddar and low fat mozerella, 98%fat free cream of chicken (didn't use cream of mush), and omitted the french fried onions. It was excellent this way!

FABULOUS!  I made this once and it became my signature dish among my friends.  They request it often and never tire of it!  I follow the recipe as it is, I eyeball the spices, and it always turns out perfect.  A little rice and you have my perfect comfort food.  I am going to have to make for dinner tonight!  Thank you so much for sharing this fabulous recipe!

This was a serious crowd pleaser! I even used frozen broccoli (thawed) and it was so easy. I left off the onion and served it over warm rice. Delicious!

This was awful!  I really don't understand all the 5 star ratings.  It was salty and strong.  Would have probably been much better without so much curry.  I kept rereading the recipe to make sure I had prepared it correctly.   Ruined my Sunday dinner.  I would definitely not recommend this recipe.

An excellent recipe.  I only added a pinch of cayenne, since I'm not fond of really spicy food and was very pleased with the results.  My 2-year-old even liked it!  I'll make this one again.

I'd give this one a 10!  My husband asked if we could have this dish once per week.  :)  He's very allergic to mushrooms, so I switched to Cream of Broccoli. Tasted great with either frozen broccoli or fresh broccoli.  YUMMY. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe. I substituted turkey for the chicken and used reduced fat cheddar (only 1 c.) Next time I'll use low fat mayo, too. It was very rich, but delicious. Oh, I also reduced the amount of cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp. since I was serving it to my kids.

This "is" the best recipie but....I had to change it a little. I used Feta cheese instead and left out the curry, salt, and pepper. You dont need it! She is right about the onions! that is what gives it the flavor!

This is the old betty crocker recipe for chicken divan minus the garlic powder,curry, and cayenne.  I've been eating it since I met my ex wife in 1983. Her mom would make it for me for doing stuff around her house, she was a widow. Still my favorite.

My whole family likes this dish.  I used to have a recipe from an old church cookbook for chicken divan and it was the best.  I accidentally gave away that cookbook and have never found the exact recipe.  This one comes close...but I add 2 tbsp of lemon juice to the soup mixture, and a dash more curry.   Served over rice it is a great meal.

I didn’t have curry, cream of chicken or French fried onions so I made a few changes. I added 5 oz plain Chobani yogurt, and 8 oz tomato sauce and I added 5 cheese tortellini to chicken and added Brussels sprouts with broccoli. I wouldn’t add any salt next time because I thought it was a bit salty, and if I did Brussels again I would cut them into quarters instead of halves. This was pretty heavy, but definitely tasty. I would make it again and modify ingredients again.

This was unexpectedly delicious. I honestly only made it because it sounded so unusual. I used about half the salt called for based on the reviews I read. I also didn't have curry, so I used half tumeric half garam masala. Because of these changes, I wasn't too sure how it would come out, but it was absolutely amazing.

Love this recipe and make as is with one exception. I omit the curry powder since my grandkids don't like that flavor. This is so awesome! They would eat it every week if I would fix it that frequently!

I used two cream of chicken soups and a can of drained mushrooms, since that's what I had available. Put the onion rings on just for the last couple minutes so they wouldn't burn (having had that disaster in a previous recipe).  It didn't go as well at the potluck as I'd hoped, but there were lots of choices and many people just don't like broccoli. So I got to take some home for another meal, which we completely enjoyed.

I love this recipe.  I have made it many times!  Today I used the leftover Christmas turkey and it's gravy.  Omitted the cream of chicken soup, used one can of golden mushroom soup and the same amount of mayo and seasonings plus a 450 gr. bag of (thawed) frozen broccoli.  Soooooooooo Good!

I will definitely make this again and again.  In fact, I have probably made it about 4-5 times already!  I don't cook the broccoli first as I like it a little crunchy still when it is all done.  I love the curry!  So does my little one!  I make my own bechamel sauce to replace the canned soups and it is way less fat and salt this way and creamier.  Replacing the mayo with 1/2 plain yogurt is another healthier alternative.  Every time I make this I have a hard time packing up left overs for the freezer!

This dish was very good. I made it twice, once for the husband and myself, then took it to a family potluck. Dish wiped clean both times. I did find that it was very rich, so the second time I made it I used all reduced fat ingredients which cut through the richness. But that is just our personal taste. All in all, the recipe was delicious!

Also want to mention that the husband ate his atop whole grain rice and I put mine on pasta one night, and a potato the other night.

I lost my chicken divan recipe that I used to make- this one is the closest I've found. The curry (I use 1.5 teaspoons instead) gives it the extra needed zing! I don't use the cayenne at all, too spicy for my family. And i use reduced fat cheddar and soups, and just 1/2 c reduced fat mayo for a slightly healthier version, lol! 
Thanks for taking the time to post this revision to the original recipe mrsladams... Magnifique!!

I made this recipe last night with a couple changes. My son hates broccoli so I used frozen corn and in going into my Mom's spice cabinet found there was no Curry! I substituted Cumin and crushed red pepper seed for the cayenne since there was none of that either and because my budget is tight I used chicken thighs that I steamed in salt, pepper, garlic and crushed red pepper seed. I waited till the last few minutes of baking to add the fried onions and served over rice. The family loved it! My son is such a picky eater and he told me more than once how much he enjoyed ... that is equivalent to getting the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval lol ... I will be making this again!

I didn't add any salt but the whole family thought it was unbearably salty.  I love spicy food but found this too spicy.  We couldn't eat it.

My husband really liked it, but even he said not to add curry next time. The kids ate it, but the leftovers did not get eaten. So, we'll have it again, without the curry.

This recipe is a true chicken divan, very tasty and easy to prepare. Because of the sodium content, I dont like to use canned soup if I can help it, so I made my own cream of chicken soup.

This halved beautifully....tried it for just my husband and myself.  It was a toss up on whether to use cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup (since I was halving the recipe), but decided on the cream of mushroom.  Used garlic powder in place of the garlic salt and no additional salt.   Turned out just great.  It is our new 'go to' chicken divan recipe.

Was very good and I will make it again. I only used 1tbsp of curry powder. Added 1/2 tea of turmeric. Also, substituted plain yogurt in lieu of the mayo. Just used frozen broccoli thawed out in tap water. Served with basmati rice.

I loved this recipe! The only changes I made were: 

Instead of fresh broccoli, I took a bag of frozen chopped broccoli and placed it in the casserole dish frozen, it cooked up just fine. I also used 1/4 cup of sour cream and 3/4 cup of mayo. I also used shredded chicken that I had made via crockpot during the day (just threw some chicken breasts and chicken broth or water in a crockpot and cooked it at low all day). It saved me alot of time by making the chicken that way and using frozen broccoli. I served it over steamed rice. 

One other note, this recipe does have a bite to it. I might scale back on the Curry and Cayenne a little bit next time. But it is still very good.

My family loved it.  I did cheat and sort of combined the ingredients of another recipe on this site "New York Chicken"  The addition of cream cheese and wine made this a five star.  I will make it oftern.

WOW, that's good!  I didn't have the French Fried onions (dang it) so threw some crushed potato chips on top, and did go 1 Tbs curry and 1/4 tsp cayenne like someone else suggested, since my kids can't handle too much heat.  It came out AWESOME.  I even served it over plain, unseasoned brown rice (bleh - but like the health benefits) and even that couldn't deter the deliciousness.  No leftovers, unfortunately :@)

I used 2 cans of Cream of Chicken b/c I didn't have Cream of Mushroom. I used fresh mushrooms instead. I used Monterrey Jack & Parmesan/Romano Cheeses instead of Cheddar (what I had on hand). I left off the french fried onions. I added a bit of milk to the mayo/cream of chicken mixture. The spices were what made this so tasty.

This was delicious! My family even voted to make it again sometime, and that means something at our house! I altered the recipe a little to make it more palatable to my family. I also made for a 9x9 pan. In the bottom of the pan I poured one can of corn. Followed with 14 ozs canned chicken. I then liberally sprinkled with pepper and garlic powder.  Combined in a bowl: one can Healthy Request cream of chicken, about 1/4 cup mayo, 2 tsp curry powder, some lemon juice, a shake or two of red pepper and parsley, more pepper and garlic powder to taste, and a handful of mozarella cheese. Thinned with a little bit of milk and poured on top. Topped with a handful of cheddar cheese. Served over mini shell noodles and with ritz crackers on the side for my kids to mash up and put on top. My husband even liked this and he doesn't like curry anything! Next time I want to try it with asparagus!

This is a childhood favorite! I prefer cream of celery soup rather than mushroom :) We also omit the onions and go with minced onion in the sauces.

This is my husband's favorite dinner! I definitely suggest cutting the curry and cayenne in half. It has such amazing flavor...party in your mouth! Also put two cups cooked white rice in the bottom of your pan. The fried onions on top make the dish. But only add for the last 10 minutes of cooking or else they will burn. Make this and impress your friends and family. You will love it!

Awful. Made exactly as submitter suggested, but definitely not for me. Used less curry as recommended and still way too much. If you're not a fan of curry, certainly do not try this recipe. It was a curry-flavored cream with some chicken and broccoli (which you couldn't taste because of the curry).

This is one of my now "all time" favorite meals. Made very minor changes. Garlic powder instead of salt, used 1/2 mayo. and 1/2 sour cream.  So happy to find this recipe. Family and friends love it.

This was great but I made a bunch of changes to suit our tastes. I decreased the curry by half (and you could still taste it), used cream of chicken with herbs, cream of mushroom, half a block of cream cheese and put all ingredients but the broccoli in a crock pot for a few hours then added the broccoli over the last half hour or so. Served with noodles and was loved by all.

I thought this was really yummy and different. Had a lot of flavor. I only used 2 tea curry. It def seemed enough to me. I cut the cayenne in half only because I have a 2 yr old. I personally would have liked to have used the whole amount. YUM! Probably will become a staple.

The flavors are very good. Recipe is very easy to make and hard to screw up. I recommend adding 1 cup of cream or half and half to increase the 'sauciness'.

This is a very good recipe. The only two changes I made was I only put 1 tablespoon of curry and just a dash of cayenne pepper. It is very heavy,so I don't recommend it for the summer. The french-fried onions made the dish! I'll will use this recipe again.

3/4 tsp curry powder 1 can condensed soup 1/2 cup mayo  My mom's ratio. Delicate but still really flavorful...my favorite recipe as a kid and now I've veganized it for my own family using tofu and soy milk based sauce.

Very tasty recipe! It has the tendency to be very salty, though. So, if you're concerned about your sodium intake, I would recommend buying low-sodium soups.

Mmmmm! I thought this was an 'all in one' dish so I had to grab some biscuits from the freezer once I saw how soupy it was. It was sooo good though! I really liked it over the biscuits too. Kind of like a dinner-appropriate Biscuits & Gravy. I will definitely make it again and next time double up for a freezer meal.

Good but not amazing - I think next time I will halve the cayenne and do half mayo half, sour cream instead of a whole cup of mayo.  I also added some carrots with the broccoli and really liked the added veggies.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I halved the recipe, and used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  Next time I think I will use more chicken.  My dad, who doesn't normally eat broccoli, loved this.

Great recipe, I love the hint of curry in the dish.  The addition of the fried onions really makes a difference.  I precooked a bag of frozen broccoli pieces and then just mixed together all of the ingredients, except 1 cup of the cheddar cheese.  Then topped with the remaining cheese.  Delicious

This is an odd recipe.  We absolutley LOVE curry - that being said we have never had it with cheese.  It just didn't seem to mix well.  However, this my possibly just be a matter of taste.  It is worth a try to make because of the ease of prep.

This was easy to make and my kids ate it.  I think I will use less curry powder next time, but otherwise, wonderful.  I have one kid with food allergies (cheese) and this was so easy to adapt to her needs.  Thanks for the nice dinner time!

I loved this recipe!  I will have to say that the spices were a little strong.  I think that is the reason why my husband didn't like it so much.  Next time I make it I will cut down the amounts of each of the spices slightly and hopefully he will like it better, because this is a recipe I would like to make fairly often.

Giving this recipe 4 stars for (1) ease and (2) family friendly .. BUT.. withhold the 5 star rating because the amount of cayenne is just too much for this recipe, and I think 2 1/2 c. of cheese is probably overdoing it as well. A little less cheese would make the sauce "spread" a bit more.. and even though I reduced the cayenne to less than 1/2 tsp, it still put the kids ON FIRE! :) I am experienced with Indian cooking (using Marsala, curry, etc), and my family typically loves spicey dishes (with as much, if not more "heat" than this recipe), but for this recipe, it was just too overpowering.  Definitely a quick family recipe - and would allow moms to sneak in other veggies (carrots, potatoes, peas, etc) very easily.  Will make again w/minor adjustments. :)

The flavors in this were fabulous, the curry didn't overpower at all.  However had to sub. Cream of Brocc for the C of M since my husband is anti-mushroom, imagine it is even more delicious with the mushroom soup.  As a serving idea my husband thought it would be good over egg noodles as well as the rice.

Very Good!  Better than an old recipe that I have used for years.  Mine did not have cayenne.  I used 1T. curry, it was just right.  I used only 1 can soup, it was just right, but the cayenne may need to be cut down for others because using less soup may not stretch the cayenne far enough.  It had a good kick.  Several other diners liked it "just like I fixed it."

I really loved this!  I give it 4 stars because my husband isn't a big fan of curry.  It is one of those spices that some people are really sensitive to...and I didn't even use more than one teaspoon.  Make sure your guests like curry or make it without.

Okay, this recipe was just mediocre.  I would say that the caption that say it "improved" traditional chicken divan is a stretch, its just a different recipe altogether- and I happen to like curry.  Sorry, I'm going back to the classic recipe.  (Tried to submit this review once already unsuccessfully, trying again - sorry if it posts twice).

I thought this was a good recipe. I will make it again except I won't use quite as much curry powder next time- as it was a little overwhelming. Also, I think it needs a little milk to be added to the soups to make it a little less thick, and give it a better consistency. Thanks!

I used less curry than was called for in the recipe (thanks for that advice!), and I think this turned out wonderfully.  My family and boyfriend all loved it (even though my boyfriend thought it needed more curry).  I've been asked a few times to make it again, so this one's definitely a keeper.

Very good!!  I used alot less curry though....1 1/2 tsp.  I loved it.  My husband didn't have the same love that I did...but he liked it.  I think it is worth making again....very tasty!!
