These are great!  I stored them overnight in the fridge so they didn't get dry. I used 1.55 oz Hershey bars for filling and topping.

Be careful not to overbake these - mine seemed a little too dry.

Do be careful not to overbake, they dry out quickly. I have made these twice, since the first time they were dry.  They're something different from a usual cupcake, but I honestly didn't think they were great, just okay.

It's kind of hard to get the measurments (of the cupcakes) right the first time but once you do this is a positivly sinful double chocolate dessert.

This was a really nice cupcake.  The key is to definatley not overbake so I suggest checking it around the 18 minute mark then continuing every minute or so if it's not done.  Either that or lower the temp to 325.  Trust me...it's worth it!
