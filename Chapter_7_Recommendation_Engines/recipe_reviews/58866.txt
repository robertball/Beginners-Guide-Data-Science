Very good but I added some ingredients, which made it even better.  I added a handful of grated Parm cheese and a handful of chopped walnuts.  Everybody loved it!!!

Guests ate this up!  AWESOME (I love olives) Changes: 2 T balsamic vinegar, 1.5 T olive oil, 2-3 garlic cloves.  For those of you without food processors, don't be afraid to use your blender.  Just add EVERYTHING all at once, or it's too dry to blend properly.  Be sure to mince the garlic before adding it to the blender.

This is similar to tapenade.  Try it with a tuna salad, on a tuna salad sandwich, or on a sandwich with baked salmon and avocado.

If you're near a Trader Joe, you can buy a jar of tapenade.  Another olive concoction is what TJ calls a Muffaletta, also sold in jard.  

ALL JUST WONDERFUL!!

I made this for a party- it was very popular!  I served it in a bread bowl with baguette slices on the side and garnished with whole olives.  The balsamic vinegar adds a great sweet/sour note to the saltiness.  If you love olives, try this spread!

This is SOOOO yummy!  I was trying to emulate an olive spread we would get at a deli near where we used to live.  This is a near perfect match!  I only used 1 tablespoon of the balsamic because I didn't want it to be too sweet -- I like the saltiness!  I am interested to try it with the required amount of balsamic though -- perhaps next time.  For serving, I toasted some baguette slices, spread a layer of homemade Garlic Spread (recipe on this site by CKBK), and then topped with the olive mixture.  It was an AMAZING appetizer!!!  Will make again.  Very pretty too.

I just made this and it is wonderful even before refrigeration.  I added about one-quarter of a cup of grated parmesean and loved the flavor it added.

I just made this for Easter and had everyone asking for the recipe.  It's fantastic.  You've got to be a big fan of olives though....which my family is.  Definitely a keeper!

I enjoyed this spread. If you are an olive fan, you will too! It is a bit salty but that is to be expected with it being 99% olives. I think it would be interesting to try adding some grated cheese to it and maybe not chopping it so finely, leaving it a little chunkier. It makes a good amount so cut the recipe in 1/2 for a smaller gathering. Thanks!

I added some roasted red pepper and artichoke hearts. I also added a bit more liquid due to the extra ingridents (red wine vinager). I took it to work at the caf√® and we slathered it on everything (exspecially some tuna burgers).

Very versatile.  I love olives but husband thought it was strong on crackers but great added to sandwiches.  I have also added it to green salads and cottage cheese and plan to try it on vegetables.  Next I might try it with pepperoncini and parmasean.

This was pretty quick and easy to make. You REALLY have to love olives for this one. I gave it 4 stars because I guess I just don't love olives that much.

Just my opinion, but the kalamata olives and balsamic was just too much. I'll try again with just green & black olives, since I like the balsamic taste. Love tangy, but this was overwhelming.

The batch I made had an unappetizing appearance, but wow, the taste was amazing! I loved it with wheat thins and triskit crackers.

I made this for a work holiday party. Everyone who tried it raved about it. We had it on slices of Italian bread. After the next day (which tasted even better) there were no leftovers to be found.  I'll no doubt make this one again for parties. The appearance wasn't very good but the taste was awesome!  I just didn't add the garlic because someone is allergic to it. Any ideas how to make it look better?

Try spreading softened cream cheese on the bottom of a dish and top with the olive spread - yummy!  Helps cut the saltiness of the olives.

This is a really good base recipe to use for olive tapenade. The only things I added to the ingredients was 3 Tbsp. of chopped capers and a few sprinkles of dry mustard. I only put half of a garlic clove in to start and then added the other half after tasting it. I also did not process this until smooth. I prefer a chunky olive tapenade so I rough chopped the olives and capers in my food processor and then mixed in the rest of the ingredients by hand. I like to lightly toast baguette slices brushed with olive oil and then spread a little bit of goat cheese on each piece before topping with the olive tapenade. Makes for a really good appetizer!

This is a delicious spread, for the serious olive lover...I used garlic-stuffed green olives and didn't add extra garlic cloves. I will probably make 1/2 recipe next time - it does make a lot. NOT the prettiest appetizer, so throw a few sprigs of parsley on top!

I love tapenade, and am not a big anchovy fan, so this was PERFECT!  Guests ate it up at a recent party.  I used a chopper instead of a food processor, and the ingrediants were a bit hard to manuever in the confined space of the chopper.  If you need to use one, I would suggest doing half at a time, then just mixing them together in the dish you serve the spread in.  Also, I suggest leaving a spoon in the spread as the oil tended to separate from the mixture.  But still was delish!

I don't live olives but i tried this during my latest brunch and fell in love with it.  So i went on a search for a recipe that minced the flavor.  SO i tried this and it was a disaster! .  I knew i wouldn't grow to love it...

Pretty  good, and very easy to make. One of the varieties of olives I used was stuffed with blue cheese, and I think that was a very good addition.

I recommend adding shaved parmesan to the recipe.  Makes it look better in appearance and tasted great. It disappeared in no time!

This is really great on little toasted baguette rounds!  If your supermarket has an olive bar you can get a good mix. Try adding a little feta cheese to the mixture! The "Magic Bullet" (as seen on TV) is perfect for this.

I tried this recipe and loved it. I also did a variant of it by changing the regular balsamic to balsamic raspberry blush, removing the olive oil and adding a package of room temperature cream cheese.  Awesome!

Very tasty.  I made it as a sandwich spread (with avocado, thin sliced tomato) based on a sandwich I ate in South Africa. I actually left out the vinegar because I thought it was savoury enough. Definitely salty - have water handy!

This was delicious!  I added chopped roma tomatoes to mine.  That cuts down on the saltiness and it looks prettier too!  I also used a chopped instead of a food processor for bigger chuncks!

Very good.  I used this on bagal chips.  The crunch is just the right texture for this spreak.

This is a great starter recipe. I found it a little sour/vinegar tasting, so I blended in some cream cheese and it was great!

It's simple: if you like olives, you'll like this.  I diced the olives before putting them in the blender, which made it easier.  To cut calories and add flavor, I added the water the olives were packed in instead of olive oil.  This turned out perfectly.  I liked it best on crackers with a hint of onion.

This recipe makes a fancy dish to bring to a party but is super easy to make.  It's always a hit (among olive lovers, anyway) and friends have stolen the recipe for other get-togethers.  Good on crostini, as a spread on a sandwich...it adds a pop of flavor to whatever you put it on!  I make it pretty much as the recipe instructs, but just kind of eyeball the measurements...This one doesn't require exact amounts.

My wife and I had olive spread with our dinner at the restaurant "Olives" at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.  This recipe is very similar to their, except they didn't combine all three types of olives.  I've only made this once, but it tastes great!  If you like olives, definitely try this recipe.

This had potential but was too flavorful, almost overpowering!

I've made this as written and its a bit disappointing, at least to me. I made my rating to reflect the original recipe as the author intended it to be made. It's a very good base of a recipe, and with some modifications it makes a very tasty dip.     Mod's in next paragraph.
I like to use the three stated varieties of olives (roughly chopped into pieces, not a paste), sub lemon juice for the vinegar, and I like to add fresh chopped rosemary and some fresh grated lemon peel.  This makes a very flavorful mix that is bright and crisp in flavor.  Somedays I add more garlic and other days I only add a little. Some days I sub in a shallet for the galic, and I sweat in some olive oil. Also always taste your olives so you can figure out the salt content! One thing I do occasionally is I rinse SOME (about 1/3 - 1/2) of  the olives if they are to salty. Done rinse them all or the flavor will be lacking.
