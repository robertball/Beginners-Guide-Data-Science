It just so happened to be National Dog Day, SO I added hotdogs to this, I found chopped collard greens n corn in the freezer, some baby tomatoes n jalapeños all went in the pool. Topped the whole thing off with leftover tots and blanketed in shredded cheese. The kids n I liked it well enough.

I used red potatoes instead of tater tots. I sautéed onions and garlic and potatoes in a skillet first to help cook the potatoes faster. I also sprinkled the potatoes with pepper and seasoned salt. Then I added it into the casserole dish with broccoli florets cheese, cream of celery can and a can of Rotel tomatoes and chilis. Mixed it all together with shredded cheese, covered and baked. FYI it still took an hour to bake. I topped it with Sour cream upon serving and oh my! It's pretty inexpensive to make too. Enjoy!
