I thought this cookie had a good overall flavor, and it got good reviews by most everyone that tried them - one even asked for the recipe, but in my opinion is not worth all of the preparation effort.  It's nearly impossible to fold in the egg whites in the end, and they're so chewy and sticky that they don't stack well for storage.  Perhaps the directions need more clarification.  I would try a different fruitcake cookie recipe next time ~ one not so labor intensive.

I followed this recipe exactly and my cookies turned out wonderfully. They look and taste just like the ones my grandmother used to make. I used a small cookie scoop and ended up with 175 cookies.
