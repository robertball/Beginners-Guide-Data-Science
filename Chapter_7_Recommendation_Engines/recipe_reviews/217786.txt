Perfect for a quick breakfast! I cut the recipe in half and sauteed the spinach with the onions until wilted then added the eggs. I whisked the eggs with a bit of milk in order to get them nice and fluffy. I also added some cherry tomatoes for a little color and flavor. I fried the bacon separately and didn't bother chopping it, but left it in strips. I cut the pitas in half and filled them, then placed the bacon and cheese inside and WOW - delicious! Sorry Heinz, but I left the ketchup on the side for dipping... but, I must say I'm a huge fan of the stuff!

I thought these were very tasty.  My wife wasn't huge on having ketchup inside.  This was very simple and I had pre-cut pita pockets.  Nice recipe.

I sauteed the spinach with a little fresh minced garlic before adding in the eggs. Instead of ketchup, I chose to use a homemade salsa. We all thought this was quite tasty. This would work just as well with tortillas, too.
