I loved the empanadas but I like the empanadas that my mother makes better. You can also just have cheese for the filling. It tastes soo good that I just had to tell you all.

                                 Francisca A.

I am rating the pastry only, because I made up my own filling.  The pastry is very light, and very flaky.  Mine didn't brown that well (maybe needs an egg wash?) but tasted fantastic nonetheless.  I kept thinking "this would make a great pie crust!"  Here's what I filled with:  1/2 lb. Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, 1 lb. ground beef, 1 boiled yellow bell pepper choppped(left over from stuffed pepper recipe), 1/2 vidalia onion chopped, 2 cloves garlic minced, 1 can diced tomatoes w/lime and cilantro, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander, salt and pepper to taste.  I had twice as much filling as I needed, so I froze the rest.  Hubby and son LOVED it.  Yay!  My first empanadas!   Thank you!

This was a ton of work for a disaster I ended up throwing away.  Fault may have been partially mine - I don't work much with dough - but even pulling the filling out and trying to eat it separately didn't work.  It was so bland!  Didn't taste anything like any of the empanadas I've had.  I only made the meat empanadas, but I won't be trying the fruit.

I made these as desert empanadas for a "mexican themed" gathering I attended.  They were quite good, and everyone liked them.  
Regarding the dough, I put the ingredients in my breadmaker and let it do the kneading for me and I just had to add a touch of flour.  Turned out great.  
I got really lucky on the oil temp with no thermometer, and they fried up nicely.. flaky and a lot like a pastry dough, really.  
The only drawback was how difficult to judge how much filling I could get in the dough (not very much), and trying to seal these suckers up without ripping the dough was a bear!  I think next time I'll make more dough and roll them out a little bit larger and thicker just to make it easier.

These rolled out really well, I thought it was to wet at first, but it was all ok after I started rolling with flour.  Everyone at work liked them, we used them for a cooking project for the disabaled and if they can do it which they did I can get my kids to roll them too.  GREAT RECIPE.

This is a great recipe. However, if you want to cut down preparation time you can get pre-made empanada dough. It can be found in your grocery's store freezer. I prefer the brand "El Sembrador". And you can fill the empanada with whatever you want. It is great for when you have leftover chicken as well. Just add the cooked chicken and any topping you and your family likes.

These were definitely not bad.  We did need to add a bit more water than called for, but I thought the dough was excellent. However, it was more like a pot-pie or pie dough and not the typical empanada dough. But it was good and with a little ingenuity, you could fill these with tons of wonderful things!

The mixture turned out really good.  These would have been really good if they were fried and not baked though.  They were good, but not excellent.  The dough seemed to overpower the taste of the sauce for me.  Everybody else loved them though!

The dough was tasty very much like a pastry dough, However I don’t think that’s how an empanada crust is supposed to taste like.   It was difficult to determine how much filling I could get in the dough, not much and trying to close them up without ripping the dough was a dilemma.  As for the meat filling I used beef, potatoe, sazon, a little of adobo and some tomato sauce; it was great.  I think I might try another recipe this one didn’t seem to meet my standards nor was it much like a traditional tasting empanada (as far as the crust is concerned).  Too Bad :-(

The dough was too dry, it definately required more than 6 tbsp of water than the recipe called for.  The results were mediocre, It was very disapointing.

I used this recipe for a Mexican dinner party, and they turned out great. Everyone enjoyed them! I had some trouble with the dough and actually had to make two batches of dough to use up most of the apple filling (this made enough empanadas for 10 people). Also I thought this was a rather easy recipe for such a delicious treat! I would definitely make it again.

not impressed.  the filling was ok at best, tasted a lot like a canned sloppy joe--and I've made a lot of crusts or pies, whatever, and this dough would not work...couldn't get it thin enough to hold the meat and too thick it tasted like unlevened bread.  would never attempt again.

These were delicious, I made the savory ones with chicken and a mushroom sauce.  It was my first time making  pastry and i was impressed!  The pastry came out like Jamaican patties.  I used twice the dough ingredients and will use the rest to make pineapple empanadas tonight.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  Natasha

these were flaky and would make an excellent pie crust which is what this tasted like. I live in Ecuador and these are not anything close to our empanadas!

I tried this recipe prior to returning to college for a meal I could make once and last for a few days. It wasn't the best empanada I ever had, but they weren't half bad.
    I made the meat filling, and I would suggest that you make the dough after the tomato mixture is simmering. My only note is to be aware of the size you cut your dough. The larger they are, the more meat they carry and less doughy they are. The size makes the difference between a snack and a meal. None the less, they are quite filling!

I will not be making these again.. I made the dough recipe to the T and it reminded my fiance and I too much of pie crust.  I figured baking them would be healthier than frying them but next time I'll take in the extra calories and fry them like empanadas should be.

i made this with everything but the meat (both the apple filling and the tomato paste/onion/pepper filling together.  it was a huge hit at the potluck i took it to and i've since made it again.  DELICIOUS!  (i did make the dough 1/2 whole wheat and rolled it out in cornmeal--worked great!)

Very good!!! Especially the apple variety. You could substitute any meat for the steak and perhaps add more spices to taste. Go wild...be creative.

The dough was easy and when rolled thin, very nice.  Eyed the liquid portion though, to get a nice looking smooth dough.  Found that 350F too low for my liking, upped it to 425F and it worked out great!  Filled with ham and cheese for a quick lunch.  Way under 1.5hrs.  Maybe half an hour from start to finish.

The filling was tasty. I was in a rush and tried to cheat by using ready made pie crusts, I dont recommend it. Next time I will make the crust myself.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  It was good and my kids liked it, but not really as an "empanada".  The crust is basically a pie crust and that kinds of alters the taste a little for me.  All that being said it is still a good recipe.  I always try to only rate recipes that I follow as written, but I accidentally altered this one.  I was going to make the meat as written and I went into auto pilot and made it a different way.  I used steak and seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder and cumin.  Then I dumped a bottle of salsa on it and cooked it all day in the crock pot.  After I made the crust I shredded the meat with a fork, drained the juice and put it in the crust.  The meat was delicious!  I just might look for another recipe when I'm craving empenadas.

These were good, the dough was a little  bland, but all in all good. The dough wasn't as hard for me, it worked out fine, and the filling is pritty much exactly what I put into my Apple Pie. It taste like a mini Apple Pie.

The dough was extremely difficult to make.  The filling, however, was delicious!

I made the dough using vegan butter instead of the shortening for a game night (have a vegan friend). Filled with soyrizo red onions and potatoes. Everyone loved them (even the meat eaters) and have made them again for another event. Everyone raves about them. It is a lot of work, but worth it.

The dough didn't stick together, and the directions weren't clear.

This recipe does not give a quantity for the water. I mixed the dough in my food processor and maybe that was the problem because it required very little water to moisten. It rolled out fine, but when it came time to put in the filling it was crumbly. I somehow managed to shape the empanadas anyway hoping that once they baked they'd be fine. But they came out even worse, the dough just turned like a wet crumbly mess of almost sand consistency. Maybe more water would help, but that's all I can think of. Instead I'll go back to my old empanada recipe.

We loved this.  Instead of adding meat, all I had on hand was ham lunch meat so I put just a little tomato sauce, sauted onions, and grated cheese.  I sprinkled in a little lemon pepper, garlic powder and paprika.  I made an egg wash for the pastry.  I'm thinking this would be a great way to use up leftovers as filling, such as meatloaf, stew, stir fry. We'll be fixing these often.
