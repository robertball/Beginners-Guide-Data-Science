This recipe has a strong emphasis on the "Vegetable" part of the name. However, if you want to play up the "Torilla" angle, I would recommend spicing it up with some fresh lime juice, a teaspoon of red chili powder and maybe even green chiles. Ole!

My husband, aka, the vegetable hater, even liked this one.  However he did pick out his tomatoes.  Making the toritilla strips crunchy by baking or frying them (I did both) made the soup.
