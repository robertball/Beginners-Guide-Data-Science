This is a good recipe. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it didn't meet my expectations. I was expecting an even better way to have puppy chow. Even though the flavors are all there, if you want puppy chow, make that - this just isn't the same and didn't satisfy my craving for it. I took it to a pot-luck, though, and everyone loved it, and it's all gone. I'll make it again, just not when I'm in the mood for actual puppy chow.

Pretty good.  Easy and a nice presentation.  Use Rice Chex perfect Crunch not too hard.

I love everything about the concept of this bar, except that it is EXTREMELY rich, sweet and over chocolatey.  Strange coming from a person who LOVES her sweets and chocolate.  The chocolate (crunch) layer on top is so insanely sweet its not enjoyable.  I also think that 1 stick of butter is way too much for the chocolate.  This made the chocolate a little too soft, I would have liked it to have a little more firmness to it.  The chex cereal gets lost in the mound of chocolate/butter/peanutbutter combo and the sugar cookie layer is just a platform for blobs of chocolate. I also skipped the powdered sugar...not hard to figure out why! I am saving this recipe though and I will try it changing the topping around.  I plan on scaling back the chocolate, peanutbutter and butter topping and keeping the chex meausurement the same.  Will report back!!

My family liked these, but I thought they were a little rich.  Next time I will make sure that I cut them pretty small.
