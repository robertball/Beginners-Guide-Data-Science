This recipe was incredibly good.  I used all ground beef instead of a mixure with pork and veal (less fat!) and it was still great.  My husband loved it, too.

This was good, my husband loved it. I added some A1 sauce, garlic salt, and minced onions. I also used a mixture of cheddar, jack, parmesan instead of all mozzarella. I then flattened it out on plastic wrap to a rectangle shape, added the cheese to the top and rolled it up sealing the edges. I cooked it on a rack over a pan so the fat would drip off as it cooked. Delicous!

Delicious! **Helpful meatloaf tip: place slices of bread under meatloaf, they will abosrb all the excess grease.

this is very good.  My 17 year old that does not like meatloaf tried it and liked it very much and said she would eat it again. I always made the meatloaf off the oatmeal box but I will be using this one now

I have to say, I don't cook much and when ever I try a new recipe it never seems to come out right.This one however is the best darn meat loaf I have ever had! I used half pork and half beef and I could'nt believe the flavor.If I could do it, anyone can.

I loved this!!! I made some changes to the original recipe though. I used a mixture of cheeses and added some garlic. I used ground sirloin and pork for the meat. I chopped up onions and mushrooms (without cooking them) and put it in there too. For the ketchup and mustard mixture I also added about a tbl or so of brown sugar. I'm not fond of mustard so I covered up the taste a little. My husband liked this more than the recipe I usually use. I will make this again and try some new variations on it.

AWESOME. I wasn't expecting a lot of flavour and considered adding ingrediants but stuck with the original recipe for the first run through and it was superb just the way it's written.

Very tasty.  I'm not a meatloaf fan and only used to make it once a year, but that changed with this recipe.  I used lean ground beef for the entire meat amount.  The topping was very good and a nice change from tomato soup or ketchup and brown sugar.  Hubby was surprised and really enjoyed it (although he'd like the tomato soup over top next time).  I may get brave and try the different meats.  Thanks for a great recipe and rescuing us from boring old meatloaf.

This was a wonderful recipe.  It was moist, tasty and just the right texture.  I changed some things - i didn't saute the onions and added minced garlic into the mix + used a generous amount of worcestershire to both the meat mix and in the ketchup/mustard topping.  Plus included some tomato sauce and honey garlic bbq sauce into the ground beef.  My hubby prefer's the recipe without the cheese (too much fat).  But I find it delicious with the cheese.  Fantastic recipe, will definitely use it again.

I love this recipe and always get compliments when I serve it.  You only need a small pinch of oregano, but that's the only thing I changed.

I have made this meat loaf a few times now, and my family says it is the best meat loaf I have ever made.  I added a little more onions and dijon mustard for a little extra kick.

Yahoooo! This meat loaf is only 8 points of weight watchers and tastes 10 times that!! I used only lean ground sirloin and salted the mixture..those were the only changes. Moist, packed with flavor, and perfection next to 2 points worth of mash potatoes..we're talking comfort food satisfaction!!!! "Keeper" on or off of weight watchers!!

My husband has no fondness for Meatloaf, but he really loved this recipe. I substituted Jack Cheese and added some worchestershire sauce. Served with mashed potatoes/gravy and fresh-steamed green beans. 2 thumbs up for this recipe!

This is excellent!  I followed the directions exactly except that I used fat free mozz. cheese.  It didn't really hold together as a loaf, and pretty much came out as a mess when I dished it out, but the taste more than makes up for looks.  I'll definately make this again!

Pretty good.  I used all beef instead of the veal and pork.  I also put a couple of slices of Swiss cheese layered in the middle.  Even my kids ate it :)

I tried this recipe as a deviation from my usual meat loaf.  I thought it was a horrible combination of ingredients.  The best part was the mustard/ketsup sauce on top.  I'll try that in the future on my own recipe.  I also liked the texture of the mixed meats over pure beef.  However the mix of mozzarella/mustard/oregano flavors was a bit bizarre for me.  My 2 yr old liked it.  We all ate it, but I wouldn't make it again.

Great easy recipe. My boyfriend keeps asking me to make it. And it works great with any kind of ground meat (except I haven't tried it with ground chicken).

I confess to liberal addition of worcetershire sauce and a clove of crushed garlic.  I also used a food-processor on a piece of sourdough bread (crusts and all) instead of italian seasoned bread-crumbs.  Other than that, I followed the recipe slavishly (even the topping!).  We quite liked it.  I used the mixture of beef, veal and pork as indicated, and served the whole shebang with rosemary-mashed potatoes (using fat-free sour cream instead of milk and butter) and steamed asparagus.

I really liked this recipe. I used all lean ground beef and it turned out good. However, if you are looking for something different from ordinary meatloaf, I recommend using the three different meats. I didn't think it tasted much different than traditional recipes. Also, make sure your dijon is FRESH for more of a kick. I also served it with homemade mashed potatoes, with garlic, parsley and parmesan added. They really went well with the meatloaf. YUMMY! I will make this again.

We loved it but felt it needed a little more zing. I think I'll add a little worcestershire next time....but will definitely make it again.

I've decided that maybe I don't like meat loaf?  I think the best prepared meat loaf is made with finely ground meat.  This was not may families favorite either, sorry.

I substituted the ground meats with ground turkey and put two hard boiled eggs inside the center. It came out very tasty.

A very nice meatloaf.  I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.  I added garlic and Italian seasonings to the mix.  Next time I would add worchestershire sauce as some others did.  I especially love leftover meatloaf sandwiches for lunch and these were delicous.  Thanks.

My brother and I thought this was really good.  My brother was disappointed at first that the "sauce" wasn't a ketchup/brown sugar mixture, but he ended up having seconds!  The dijon mustard gave the meatloaf a spicy twist that we both liked.  Also, the cheese in this recipe also sets this meatloaf apart from others.  I don't think I would change a thing.

We LOVE this meatloaf. Ever since I found it in the Cooking Light Cookbook it's been a staple recipe at my house.  The cheese makes it really flavorful and the ketchup/mustard topping tastes delicious.  Just cook up some veggies and serve! Great for sandwiches also.

Very good!  It is not your traditional meatloaf, but if you get over that, you can really enjoy this unique tasting dish.  I used ground pork and ground beef (lean for both).  My husband really enjoyed it as well and I will definately keep this as my new meatloaf recipe!

Great recipe! I just made it with 1 lb. ground turkey, added 1 cup of green peppers, 1 clove of minced garlic,didn't sautee any vegetables. I also substituted 2 tbs. of ricotta for the parmesan. I also added some salt and cajun spices to make it my own. My husband raved to all his friends how delicious it was.

This is the best recipe for meat loaf I've ever tried.  My family agrees.  Very tasty - lots of the "right" ingredients, but not overly spicy.  Just right - nice and moist.  I also mix the ketchup & mustard topping with 2-3 tablespoons of brown sugar.

My family and I just didn't care for this meat loaf.  Perhaps it is because I used a little more meat than what is called for.  I didn't care for the beef/pork/veal mixture even though I have another meat loaf recipe that uses the same combination.  I think I would like this better with just ground beef.  I think I'll stick with my old recipe or Tantalizingly Tangy Meat Loaf from this site.

Wow!  I'm throwing away my old meatloaf recipe.  This one is so tasty.  I think the ground pork really adds a good flavor.  Even family members who aren't big meat eaters kept picking at this meatloaf.

This is a very tasty meat loaf. The first time I made it I didn't have oregano.  It taste fine without it.  My husband prefers not to eat pork so I always prepare it with 1 lb. beef 1/2 lb. veal.  Still, it's very tasty.  My father liked it so much my mother now uses the recipe.  The meat and cheese leave a lot of oil in the pan after baking -- I always pour just about all of it out. If not, this dish is too oily.

Very yummy recipe.  I made this dish for my boyfriend because he is a big ground beef lover.  I, on the other hand, am not a big fan of meat loaf, but I decided to try this recipe anyways... and I'm glad that I did. It was delicious.  Thank you, Michi in Miami
