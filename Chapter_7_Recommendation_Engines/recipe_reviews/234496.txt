I want to give this recipe 5 stars for the flavor, but I almost want to subtract a star because, at least in my experience, the amount of water called for is way way too low.  I made this recipe using Bisquick mix and substituting additional white chocolate chips for the pecans to make them more toddler friendly.  When I initially mixed the batter I used the 1/2 cup water called for and the batter was very thick.  So I added additional water as suggested, about 3-4 tablespoons.  It was still pretty thick, but I thought maybe that was how it was supposed to be.  However, when I cooked the first ones I knew the thickness was a bad thing as I had heavy cakes that were done on the outside and raw in the middle.  So I mixed in more and more water until the consistency was better, which ended up being more than 1 cup of extra water (1.5 - 2 cups total).   After all that extra mixing the pancakes were pretty tough, although the flavor was divine.  I feel that the recipe should start with at least 1 cup of water and then add more as needed.  I will make these often and will add more water to start with and reduce the amount of mixing I had to do this time.

Just a comment and I know it has been mentioned before. When people review the recipe, why can't the recipe be reviewed exactly as submitted? I see high ratings and then read reviews and some have "rewritten" the recipe with different ingredients, etc., etc. Again, can't rating be on original recipe and then the "new" recipe submitted?

I happened to be out of white chocolate chips, I used Hershey's cinnamon chips. Instead of stirring them into the batter, I sprinkled a little over the batter after I ladled it onto the griddle. I also increased the pecans a touch. I did not try these myself but I got double thumbs up from both kids. They asked for seconds and for me to make these tomorrow.

I think we'll try making these as waffles. Even with a lot of extra water, they still would not cook all the way through. The flavor is wonderful but I'll definitely be going back to the drawing board!

I tried the griddle cakes today...they were yummy!  I halved it
and used Krusteaz mix and instead of cinnamon, 2tsps of
pumpkin pie spice...Definitely worked better using 1/4 cup
of batter per pancake than 1/2 cup.  Dipped them in warm
syrup...thanks!

I tried this recipe today and also found it necessary to add more liquid.
The mixture was dry crumbles at first, so I added 1 cup additional water and 1 cup buttermilk. The batter was still a little too thick, so I added about 1/4 cup more water.  The end product was great, however this recipe definitely needs to be revised.
