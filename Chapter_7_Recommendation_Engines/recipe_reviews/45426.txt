Made in CrockPot.  Best soup I have ever made. I substituted Turkey Sausage and doubled it.  Also I omited pasta and 2 cups of water. Browned Turkey, Onion, garlic, and celery then put everthing in crockpot except diced tomatoes.  Cooked on high for 3 hours.  Added tomatos and cooked on low for 4- 5 hours.

This was a very good recipe. The only changes I made were 1. salt to taste since others said it was too salty, 2. used 2 ribs of celery (instead of one), 3. used twice as much italian sausage (and used hot instead of sweet), 4. cut out the water and used chicken stock exclusively, 5. used crushed tomatoes with italian seasonings instead of diced, 6. cut up a 6 oz. bag of fresh spinach and let it cook along, and 7. added crushed red pepper since we like it spicy. It was very tasty and made a ton! We'll have leftovers for days...

I love the  sausage and lentil soup at Carrabb's Grill and always wish I would be able to get the recipe.  Well, I thought this came extremely close.  I served it with French Bread, huge hit in our home.  Next time I will serve it in bread bowls.  Thank you.

This soup turned out fantastic!  It's almost exactly like Carabba's lentil & sausage soup.  To kick it up I added about 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes and it spiced it up like the restaurant version.  Will definitely pass on this recipe.

This is one of our favorites.  I chop the carrots instead of shred.  I also use turkey sausage and nearly double the amt.  I also add chopped kale or swiss chard to make it prettier and more nutritious.  Excellent soup!

My husband really enjoyed this!  I cooked it in my crockpot since I was out shopping all day.  I used chorizo and andouille sausage which made it spicy.  I used 6 c. of water.  I used 2 ribs of celery. I used stewed tomatoes and pureed them in the blender.  I could have used less salt.  I did not add pasta as we are trying to eat lo-carb.  Very tasty!

This is a hearty and satisfying “peasant-style” soup – delicious, aromatic and so easy to make with its few, simple ingredients.   And for basically just pennies a serving!  I prepared this for the Italian New Year tradition to eat lentils and pork sausage for prosperity and good luck for the coming year.  I made half a recipe and it made a good-sized pot of soup.  I used tomato sauce, put up from my garden, in place of the canned tomatoes.  I had to add a fairly significant amount of both water and additional chicken broth while the soup cooked, as it continued to get thicker and thicker.  While many additions or changes could be made if one felt compelled to, this can be prepared with confidence just as is.

Very good flavor, lots of veggies that go well with the lentils.  I did not dice the carrots, but cut them in rounds.  Like some of other reviewers, I only needed to cook this for about one-and-a-half hours (one hour before I added the pasta, then another 30 minutes after).  Next time, I might add a little red pepper to spice it up a little, but it was a great flavor, very filling, very hearty.

This soup is wonderful!  I double the amount of sausage and use the hot italian, but that's just a matter of personal preference.  Thanks for sharing!

This soup was great.  It was easy to make and my friends liked it.  I used andouille sausage instead because it was what I had on hand.  This was fantastic and I will make it again.

This was really good, especially with some fresh parmesan and romano cheese grated on top.  Very easy, too.

Being a VEGAN, I used Field Roast Chipotle Mexican vegan sausage (SPICY and sooooooo good) and "no-chik'n" broth.  Cooked it in the slow cooker (took quite a bit longer though).  My husband LOVES it.  This will definitely be a staple throughout winter!

This was really great. I did it as written, but did not include the pasta. Might make it in the crockpot next time. It was a great winter soup. My whole family loved it. Thanks! UPDATE: Cooked this in the crockpot. Browned the sausage, then put everything in the crockpot, but only 6 cups of water. I had cut up the veggies the night before to make it easier in the morning. Cooked on low for 8 hours. It was delicious!

This was amazing! loved it. I only had half a bag of lentils, but I think that was more than enough. I only added about half the chicken broth b/c of this. added more of the veggies, omitted the bay leaf and used dried parsley and a fresh tomato on top of the canned. Thanks!!!

Made this recipe according to the author except I used a full pound of hot Italian sausage and added a bunch of fresh spinach right before I served it. Additionally I added 1/2 teaspoon of smoked Chipotle powder. Hands down the best soup I have ever made. Delicious!

I made this tonight it was excellent! I did make a few changes, I cooked it only for 1 1/2 hours, added fresh spinach, a giant can of fat free chicken broth (48 oz), and 4 cups of water in place of the stated amounts. Also used crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  Lastly, I added a little red pepper and very little salt, I didn't have oregon so I skipped that.  Even my picky husband loved this! Thanks for sharing!

make this soup all the time and I love it!! It is just as good as Carrabba's :) I use hot Italian turkey sausage (healthier!) and add a little crushed pepper to kick it up a notch. I also use all chicken broth instead of water. It's a very filling, very flavorful, and very healthy soup! Oh, and I've never cooked it for 2.5 or 3 hours....1 hour or so seems to be plenty!

This is such a great winter soup and it tastes sooo good.  My husband said it was the best soup I've ever made! I used 1lb chicken sausage, 2 celery stalks, 8-10 cloves of garlic, 6 cups homemade chicken broth and 4 cups water. I sauteed the celery, carrots and onion with some garlic, and added the sausage after about 5 minutes.  I only did a couple shakes of the salt shaker, so maybe about 1/8tsp of salt and I'm glad I didn't do more then that. The sausage already adds a lot of salt.  It only took about 2 hours to cook and I served it with Finnish Pulla from this site. This is such a good soup! Thank you!

First let me say that I followed the recipe exactly.   The flavor of the sausage was overwhelming, all I could taste was the basil and sweetness of the sausage.  And I don't know if the lentils I used were the wrong kind, but they cooked into mush, and I only cooked it for an hour.  I used red lentils, don't know if that made a difference, got them from a health food store that sells them in bulk.  My soup turned out very thick and mushy, not what I was hoping for.  I can't express enough how strong the sausage flavor was, it was not very appetizing at all.  I think it would have been better if I had used ham instead.  Won't make again, sorry.

Yummy! I used Italian style tomatoes, subbed tomato sauce for part of the water, used double the sausage, and left out the pasta.  My picky son ate two bowls! Gotta love that!

This is the first time I liked something well enough to write a review.  We did not realize we were lentil fans.  We are now!  This was very easy to prepare and had an amazing flavor.  I only gave the recipe 4 stars because it only needed to cook half the time.

I would give this soup 10 stars.  It was fantastic.  Followed recipe,  except I used turkey sausage and 1 tsp. of seasoned salt instead of 1 tbsp. of salt.  Forgot to add the pasta, nobody missed it.  Loved this soup.

Made using pressure cooker (high pressure 8 min).  Used total 6 cups liquid (broth/water).  Added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  Before serving use stick blender to make soup "thicker".  Excellent!

This soup was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly (because I felt like) and it was delicious. Even my boys (5 and 2) loved it. Up until now I couldn't get my older son to eat onion or celery in a soup; I have to strain it first. I would make this soup again just for this reason alone. We all loved it, the flavor was great. I think I might experiment with different chicken or turkey sausage or leaving it out because there was so much flavor. This is going into my regular rotation. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a hit with the entire family... a grand accomplishment in this household! I tried to make the recipe to the letter, but, alas, I can't make anything without tweaking it at least a little.  Doubled the sausage and probably quintupled the garlic.  Subbed dried rosemary for the thyme, even though I like thyme. Hey - was in the mood for rosemary.  Sliced the carrots into coins, rather than shred my knuckles, LOL.  Since I always use chicken soup base paste, rather than canned broth, I'm not sure if my broth measurements were precise.  Just winged-it.  Still turned out to be a lovely meal; I don't miss Carrabba's sausage and lentil soup at all, anymore! We grown-folks added some heat to our bowls, but the soup really didn't need it.  One of the few dishes we actually preferred without the hot stuff.... and that's saying something.

We really loved this beautiful soup!  I made only these changes: I reduced the water (by 2 cups), used only one 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes, and did not add the optional pasta.  It was plenty hardy still, and would not have fit in my slow cooker otherwise!  :)  If I was making this in a stock pot, I would definitely try the original recipe as written, as I'm sure it's delicious.  As it was, we absolutely loved it and will definitely make it again.  Thank you so much for the great recipe!

This was a keeper. I changed it up a little bit and I would make it again. I used a pound of Johnsonville All Natural Sweet Italian sausage and added a few chili flakes. I used all chicken broth (3 quarts) instead of the broth and water called for and I used 1/2 lb lentils and 1/2 lb lentil wild rice blend from the bulk section at WinCo.  Cooked for about 30 - 45 minutes stove top until the lentils were tender and then added the tomatoes. (When cooking lentils and beans adding tomatoes before the lentils are soft keeps them from softening) Then into a large crockpot on low until it was time for dinner. 
This would be a great dinner to have waiting at home after practice.

Skipped tomatoes, skipped pasta. Used turkey broth. Also added 2 tsp of fennel seeds to sweet chicken italian sausage. Added 1/2 cup Quinoa  since we were going for super healthy meal. Added a couple handfuls of spinach before serving. EXCELLENT!

Very tasty!  I used bison sausages and put it in the slow cooker after cooking the vegetable (I baked the sausages separately) -- however, next time, I'll make sure to add the stock & lentils & bring to a boil before putting in the slow cooker.  I didn't do that, so I had to put it on for about 14 hours to get the lentils soft - still it was great!

We loved this!  I deviated from the recipe just a little by increasing the sausage by half, using 2 stalks of celery, and chopping the carrot rather than shredding it.  I used all chicken broth, no water, and I skipped the pasta because we didn’t think it needed it.  I thought that 1 T. of garlic powder might be overkill, but it wasn’t and I used it all.  I started checking this after an hour of simmering, but in my opinion the lentils weren’t nearly soft enough.  I checked it every half hour after that, but ended up simmering this for the full 3 hours. This makes a big batch of soup, but I froze the leftovers to be enjoyed again and again!  UPDATE 3/7/13 - I made this again.  This time using only 8 oz. of hot Italian sausage which wasn't nearly enough.  Next time I will double it to a full pound.  I also used two really large cloves of garlic, rather than the garlic powder, that I added to the onions when they were just about translucent.

Very good flavor. I used polish rope sausage because it was what I had on hand. I think either would be good. Used a bit more chilli pepper flakes. Nice and spicy with deep flavor. Oops I forgot I also used beef broth instead of chicken. Made it richer I'm sure. Nice way to use up a bunch of lentils I had in the pantry.

Was good as a starting point, but a little bland for a start.  Will probably try it again but try some of the suggested changes of other reviewers - like spicy sausage or something.

I made this with turkey sausage and schredded a beat instead of carrots.  Was delicious- the whole family loved it including my 6 and 4 year old.

I was looking for a recipe that would rival Carrabba's Spicy Lentil Soup.  This one is so very close!!  We loved it!  I used hot Italian sausage and doubled the meat.  I also added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes.  Loved it!!!!!

This recipe is wonderful. We all enjoyed it. The only thing that I changed was, I cooked the ditalini separately,and put it in a gallon size ziploc bag and refrigerated it. I add the pasta to each individual bowl of soup, so that the pasta stays firm and doesn't go mushy on me. I always do this with any soups that have pasta in them. Makes a huge difference. Will make this recipe often, during the cold winter months.

Excellent recipe as written! What I have done differently making this soup many more times is this: Bump up sausage to one pound, as sausage is usually sold in one pound units and what else am I to do with the leftover half pound,other than toss it onto some pasta with tomato sauce -that was good too. Same with the pasta, bump that up to a full pound too. Next, I have doubled the quantity of dried herbs, using 2 teaspoons of an Italian blend. Skip the salt, plenty of that already in the sausage. And reduce water to 6 cups and replace with 2 more cups of broth. Make sure to use brown or green lentils. The red and yellow lentils will turn to mush.  These changes intensify the flavor, and it becomes more like stew on the soup/stew scale. 

Slice some Italian bread, spread with soft butter, sprinkle some grated parmasan cheese and a pinch of Italian herbs, place buttered/cheese side down on the griddle and fry until crisp golden brown. Very filling.

This soup was excellent! I used a 14 bean mix. I did soak the beans prior and pressure cooked for 30 mins to speed up the process. The flavor was wonderful. Added a dash of hot sauce and kick it up a little too.

As other reviewers suggested, I used hot Italian sausage and added in 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper (and the rest of the spices the recipe called for). The result was a spicy, delicious soup! We like our soups a little thicker so I added 9 cups of water and three bouillon cubes and it was perfect. I cooked on low for about 1.5 hours and it was done. Great recipe.

If this went to a million stars I would rate it the highest of the highest. I used mild italian sausage instead of sweet but otherwise did the recipe exactly. I can't stop eating it.....BY FAR one of the best soups I've ever made (if not theeeee best).

This actually surprised me how good this was and comparable to Carraba's....I used hot Italian chicken sausage from Trader Joe's...it gave it the same flavor...but I had more or less sausage "discs" vs..crumbled sausage.  Will make with a different sausage next time...but either way unbelievabley tasty.  My husband said "you can make this anytime"....and I will!

Great soup.  I used chorizo sausage instead for color and a little kick.  I sauteed the onion, celery and carrot first as well, for added flavor.  I used all chicken stock and red lentils for color.  This is great with toasted croutons on top.

Yummy and flexible.  I doubled the amount of meat, used turkey sweet sausage.  Omited the pasta.  All else as written.  Served with crusty bread.  DELICIOUS.  There's a lot of soup but that's a good thing.  Thank you.

This is an awesome soup! I tried it out on my husband first and he gave it his stamp of approval so I made it for a luncheon at work.  Big Hit!  I used some chorizo sausage just to spice it up a bit.

It was hot in MN today but hubby had the AC cranked up inside and I was happy to have this soup for dinner. I followed the directions exactly and it came out great. Next time I might double the sausage but otherwise I wouldn't change anything. I used the pasta too and it really soaked up liquid after sitting in the fridge so I think I'll have to add a little water to thin out leftovers when reheating.

This was fabulous. I used a pound of sweet Italian turkey sausage, skipped the pasta and added some fresh cut up kale. Great as leftovers and it freezes well.

I fed the church with this today and it was a hit! Since I am in Mexico and could not find ditalini pasta I substituded with small elbow macaroni pasta. I also could not find canned diced tomatoes so I added 5 fresh diced tomatoes.

This was my first experience with lentils somehow, and my husband's as well. It was incredible. I'll definitely be making it again! I used 1 lb of sausage and left the celery and carrots chunky. I think I'll double the amount of these next time because the more the better IMO. The only odd thing is that the soup was done after about an hour, not the 2 1/2 - 3 indicated in the recipe. Try this recipe though - you'll LOVE it.

I couldn't rate it 5 stars as written, the seasoning lacked something.  I upped the flavour by adding a splash of Worchestershire sauce and added some Old Bay Seasoning to round out the flavour.  Be careful with the salt; with the Worchestershire and Old Bay Seasoning, I did not add the tablespoon of salt called for in the recipe since these seasonings already contain salt, as do the canned tomatoes, sausages, and chicken broth.

I love this soup and will make it again - DH thought it was just ok but he hates lentils :) I meant to cook the lentils separately and blend them but I added them in the regular pan so after an hour I blended everything lol so that made it weird to him - I'll do the lentils separate next time, blend then add to the soup. I followed the recipe very close, used half sweet & half hot sausage (I usually do that) and just used 8c water w/3tbsp powdered chicken broth, there was plenty of liquid. That's the only change - except for using WW orzo for the pasta but that didn't change the flavor.

My family very much enjoyed this soup.  I  made revisions - only because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I fried the onions in all the spices until they were translucent, added Kielbasa sausage, shredded carrots, sliced celery and some of the chicken stock, can of lentils and black beans.  I let that simmer for about 15 minutes.  
I then heated the remainder of the chicken stock, added water, the sausage mixture, 1TBS of sugar and 1 TBS of red wine vinegar.  I then  salted to taste.
It was really good.  The vinegar really adds something.

A delicious and hearty soup.  I used chicken sausage and red lentils.  Because the red lentil cook pretty fast and turn to mush if cooked for too long, I added them last and then let the pot simmer for about 15 minutes.  Came out perfect!

Way too salty. When I read the recipe I thought it was too heavy on the salt so I only put half of the amout called for. Next time i'll omit the salt all together.

This soup is awesome! We were 3 days into a snow storm and I was freezer/pantry diving and this fit the bill. I doubled the onions, celery and carrots. I had frozen cooked lentils, I used 6 cups. I used Better than Bouillon, vegetable bouillon not water and chicken stock. I didn't have diced tomatoes, I used 8 oz no salt added tomato sauce and 8 oz salsa. For the spices I used my homemade salt free Mexican seasoning, dried parley for the fresh, and I omitted the salt. I also had a bunch of kale to use up, I added that and cooked the soup for about 45 minutes.

This is a hearty, flavorful soup that smells wonderful while simmering.  I substituted chicken broth for the water and added a tablespoon of tomato paste, a pinch of red pepper flakes, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of Sriracha.  I also upped the amount of Italian sweet sausage to 1 lb.  Did not add pasta because I wanted more of a soup, rather than stew, consistency.  Will be making this one again!

Excellent light dinner served with a salad! 
My preferences:  No tomato. No pasta. Salt to taste at the end....1 TBSP listed is too much!!
Used only fresh garlic and fresh herbs. 
I diced all the vegetables about the same size as the lentils(1/4 inch), and added 2 TBSP red bell pepper.  
I used Oscar Mayer Turkey Sausage-small dice, adding the sausage after the first 30 minutes. 
Started with 1 box broth and 10 cups water and simmered for 1 1/2 hours, I wanted the lentils to maintain their shape and not turn to mush.  
If you cook it longer or higher you may have to add more liquid. 
Romano cheese sprinkled at the end is really unnecessary, plenty of flavor going on already!
Portioned into servings and froze the left over for easy quick individual meals. 
This recipe is a keeper!!

This soup was amazing!  The only changes I made were chopped carrots instead of shredded, 6 cups water, spicy sausage, and no pasta or thyme.
I also only cooked it for an hour which is all it took to get the lentils soft.  It was sooo tasty and spicy!  My husband loved it and so did my two year old.  I froze a container for my parents and my mom is asking for the recipe.  This is the best soup I've probably ever had!

Definitely will try this next time with the hot sausage.  I used mild and added red pepper flakes, but it was too spicy.  Will not do the red pepper next time.  I think this was a tasty substitute for the Carabba's restaurant version which I love!

Loved this!  I was looking for a recipe that would make lentils more tasty to eat, since they're so healthy.  I don't usually like regular lentil soup.  This was perfect.  I left out the water and made it more like a chili or thicker soup.  Delicious!  I will definitely be adding this to my dinner repertoire, especially in the winter months.

Tasty. As written, I thought it was lacking something. It tasted just a little "flat." I added a few spoonfuls of tomato paste and red wine vinegar and really liked the result. Served it over  quinoa instead of pasta.

I made the recipe as instructed and thought that the sausage was overpowering as were the Italian spices.  I couldn't taste the lentils or vegetables just the sausage and spice.

Just made this soup. Doubled the recipe to give a batch to a sick friend.  Careful, halfway through I had to split into two pots because it makes so much. Tastes fantastic. I always add extra amounts of veggies, so I did. Full of flavor. Happy I chose this one to give away. Thank you

I made this tonight, and didn't have carrots, so substituted fennel for them. I diced it up so that it wasn't chunky. The recipe made about 17 cups of soup, and tasted very good. The only other change I made, because I didn't have chicken broth, was to use Better Than Bouillon. Better Than Bouillon is fairly salty, so I left out the salt and only used 2 teaspoons of the Better Than Bouillon for the entire pot of soup. I recommend this soup! It will feed the 3 of us 3 meals, which was an added bonus to me.

Great recipe.  I used premade lentils that I found at my local store so I didn't have to wait for them to cook. I also used chicken sausage cause I don't eat pork. My family loved it including my toddler. Plus I didn't add the pasta and I doubled the veggies. It was better the next day too. I will be making this again!

Made this for New Year's Eve 2013.  Italians usually eat some kind of beans on New Years.  My family loved it.  I did use more Italian sausage.  It was delicious.

Made exactly as specified in the recipe except for the pasta. My wife and I both thought it on the bland side and felt the 8 cups of water made it, well, kind of watery. If I were to make it again, I'd add more sausage and maybe some hot chili paste along with using the pasta.

Wow!  This was really good! My husband, who is not a fan of legume soups, even thought so. I used hot Italian turkey sausage (had a 20 oz package and used the whole thing).  I didn't have any tomatoes, but I threw in an 8 oz can of tomato sauce I did have.  Per other reviews, I cut liquids back a little.  I used 9 cups of water and chicken bouillon granules (almost 3 Tbsp).  Because of the bouillon, there was no need to add the salt called for in the recipe.  It was perfect without any added salt (and I'm not shy when it comes to salt). 
This was my first attempt at lentil soup, and I am thrilled with the results.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this soup a few times.  i always add 1 lb of sausage instead of the 1/2 lb since I like a hearty meaty soup.  Also I don't shred the carrots but cut them in rounds.  all the other proportions were spot on.  I've also used bow tie pasta, shells and macaroni noodles in place of the ditalini pasta only because I didn't have it on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I also cut up the carrots into small pieces. I used a home made chicken broth (recipe from this site) only 6 cups of water bc my pot could not hold 8 but I think the soup is better with just 6. And I didnt add the pasta, felt no need for it. Really tasty soup, filled me up.

This came out great!  A big hit with the whole family.  Made a double recipe to freeze some for later and share with freinds.  Ended up adding a fair amount more broth/water later (probably 30 oz or so) as it got really thick with the pasta in there.  THANKS!

This is probably the best soup I've ever made. Everyone who has tasted it just raves about it. I love hearty soup, so I use 2 lbs of Italian sausage then add the full amount of liquid - though I use about 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water. I also omit the pasta - it doesn't need it. 

Will definitely make this again and again.

Really good soup. I wish I had put the sausage aside and added that in at the very end because it gave all of its flavor up to the soup. I also added a diced sweet potato when I tossed in the tomatoes and some spinach at the very end. Very yummy recipe!

This was great! I followed the recipe very closely, except used 1.25 lbs of turkey italian sausage (it was pre-packaged, and I didn't know what I would have done with the rest of it if I hadn't thrown it in), dried parsley, chicken broth instead of the water, and by the end, it was so thick I didn't even add the ditalini, and it wasn't missed.  I also included some red pepper flakes, but that is personal preference and it may not have been needed.  It makes a LOT and we froze some.  It freezes well and tasted just as delicious out of the freezer a few weeks later.  (Not sure if I would recommend the freezing if we would have included the pasta.)  Healthy and delicious.  Even my husband, who typically only likes cream-based soups, enjoyed it.

this recipe makes a lot of soup, so be sure to have a big pot (i had to run out and buy one) few things i would do differently is add more sausage, omit the garlic powder and use fresh garlic instead. oregano and thyme are strong spices and will omit those two.  prefer chopped carrots. you can pretty much add any vegetable you want.  note: it does not take 3 hours to cook! at most, 1 hour.

mmmm, good. I skipped the past and used about 3/4 lb sweet It sausage, and only 6 cups of water. The only thing I will change for future batches is to drain the sausage better first and add spinach at the end. I didn't add any salt-never do except for baking- and didn't use parsley since we didn't have any.
I made this again for company with sweet italian turkey sausage (3 links), all broth, and threw in some spinach towards the end. Everyone loved it, and asked for the recipe. It does make a lot and I was glad to read that it froze well. For just the 2 of us, I make 1/2 recipe.

I can't eat Italian sausage so this is coming second hand, but my husband said this was really good.  We were looking for a recipe that was close to Carabba's soup and this is nearly it.  He said the restaurant's had a more "meaty" flavor other then that the textures and flavors were dead on.

This was delicious with a few changes.  I added chopped kale at the end of the cooking process.  doubled carrots, garlic and celery.  diced the carrot instead shredding.  and used 8 cups of homemade chicken stock and 2 cups of water.  Also added orzo pasta.

Excellent! Followed recipe almost exactly. Didn't have bay leaves, but this recipe was great! Instead of adding the pasta, I added 1/4 cup of barley. Delicious. I also used 1 lb. of chicken sausage.

Wow, is this soup delicious! I used this recipe as the basis and did my own thing from there. I used chicken sausage, omitted the carrots as I didn't have any, added about 1/2 a chopped sweet red pepper, 8 - 10 cloves of garlic (omitting the garlic powder), also added about 1/2 C red wine, doubled the broth, and used only fresh herbs also adding sage. I used whole wheat orzo. This is a thick hearty soup in spite of the added broth. My kind of soup on a cool autumn evening. It only needs a small tossed green salad and some good crusty french bread! YUM!!!!

Very very good and tastes a lot like Carrabba's sausage and lentil soup. Instead of using a 1/2 pound of Sweet Italian sausage, I used a quarter and added a quarter of a pound of kielbasa. Instead of chicken broth I used beef broth. I cooked the soup on medium high for an hour, covered and it was perfect! No need to cook it for 3  hours.

This soup is spectacular!  Huge favorite.  I've made it twice in 2 weeks.  In the summer.  In Phoenix!  It's THAT good.  
I tend to overcook mine so it's a little mushy or more like a pea soup texture, which I like.  I've also used black lentils with pink lentils for a different texture. I also leave out the pasta.  I'm sure it actually adds to the glory, but I can't eat it.  The secret is in the seasonings.  The author of this recipe is genius and I applaud them!  Thank you for making a healthy soup that is easy to make and great tasting!

I also made this in my Crock-Pot.  Really tasty soup... and even better the next day!!  I found it a little watery for my tastes on the first day, but it thickened up nicely for the second day.  I will try spicy sausage next time I make it.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved this soup. Next time, I will cook the lentils separately and then add to the soup to make sure they are done enough. Mine were a bit undercooked.

I love this soup! I added everything except the carrots (I didn't have those on hand) and I used dried minced garlic and turkey sausage. It was wonderful with a few drops of tabasco sauce and a side of garlic bread. My father-in-law was sick and I took it over to him and my mother-in-law and they really enjoyed it, too. I just wish my husband and kids liked soup like I do. Every time I make it I share it with others besides them!! :)

This soup is sooo yummy. Perfect on a cold day and even more perfect when made in a crock pot. I didn't have to changes anything except I had mine with  cornbread and honey. Highly reccomended.

This is awesome.  The only thing that I did different was instead of sweet Italian sausage I used deer sausage, I did not use thyme, and I did not add salt.  Other than that I did everything just like the recipe and my wife and I loved it.  I will definitely cook this again!!!!!

this overall was a pretty good soup. i bought mild italian sausage and it was pretty good but i think next time i would try hot italian sausage because i just like spicy food. next time i wouldnt use all the lentils but my family really liked it when i made it... the only downside was that it makes you fart. haha

Oh my goodness, I love this soup!  The only changes I made were:  Used sliced smoked sausage, homemade chicken stock in place of the canned broth & water, and left out the tomatoes (I love tomatoes, but I think lentil soups are better without them).  The seasonings were so good, and the soup so flavorful.  Oh, I also replaced the pasta with brown rice.  We all love this soup and have made it a couple times, and will continue to make it often.  Oh, I've also made it in my crock pot, and it turns out great.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is so good and easy to prepare. The only change I made was to use all chicken stock and no water. This is so delicious I ate some for breakfast.

Just tried this recipe and it was absolutely wonderful.  The only difference I made was to put in two ham hocks for the meat.  Cooked them for about an hour and took out the bones and chopped up the meat and put back into the soup.  Great recipe

Loved the recipe, even my picky teens. I simmered for about 45 minutes.  I used pre-cooked lentils from Trader Joes and added those with the pasta during last 20 minutes.  I also chopped the carrots, added some zucchini and spinach.  I used a lot less water since we like thicker soup.  Excellent.

Very Very good soup. but instead of shredded carrots I added whole baby carrots. I also added spinach, and corn. I didn't have fresh parsley at the time so I use dried I also added a little of Mrs. Dash to give it more flavor. also added garden rotini to give more color to the soup.

Thank you...This is just such a great recipe... I had to send in a review...and this is my first ever review.  My whole family...even picky daughter loved this soup.  It's a keeper.  I had to make a just few small changes - only because of what I had or didn't have on hand.  I used hot italian sausage instead of sweet, instead of two cans of chicken broth, I used only one - but added a can of Progresso french onion soup - it sounded like it would work...and it really did.  I also chopped the carrots instead of shredding and I used four fresh bay leaves instead of two dried.  I also didn't use garlic powder - I used a lot of fresh garlic because we love garlic...and I didn't have ditalini pasta, so I used regular elbow macaroni....and it was just delicious.  I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow - we have plenty leftover.  Thanks again for the wonderful recipe - we were tired of the same old way of making lentil soup.

I was excited about eating this until I added the pasta and saw how thick it became.  However, the flavor was good and it was very easy to make.

This was quite good. I did ignore the directions in that I did not add the pasta, only used four cups of water and a beer and put in the seasonings that sounded good to me only. It was yummy. I will make this one again. Thank you.

I used a whole pound of Italian sausage for this.  Once I browned the sausage, I put it in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients on high for 4 hours.  I also reduced the amount of water to 6 cups and added the pasta during the last 25 minutes of cooking.  This turned out more like  stew, but it was positively delicious!

Very good.  I used two sausage links we had but I do not knwo what variety (maybe garlic?) and I reduced the water to 6 cups like on of the reviews suggested and only added 1/2 teaspoon salt per another review.  Pretty good, but I might use mroe sausage next time, just becuase it was so good when drenched in all the soup flavorings.  Fairly inexpensive meal, especially if you use less sausage.

Yum,Yum.This is an excellent recipe. I substituted hot italian sausage  & it kicked it up a bit (nice & spicy) just like Carrabba's soup. It's a wonderful , hearty meal!

This soup is OUTSTANDING!!! We just made this tonight and it tasted just like "carabas" spicy sausage and lentil soup, except of course it wasn't spicy. Only changes we made was that we used mild italian sausage other than sweet, added a bit more salt to taste, added a can of spinach towards the end of cooking and instead of cooking it for 2 to 3 hours, we used our pressure cooker and it was done in less than 30 minutes! A very good looking sopu, a meal within itself!

Flavorful, hearty, and healthy.  Great recipe just as written.  Second time I made this I doubled the sausage to 1 pound, substituted more of the chicken broth instead of water, added a pinch more of each seasoning except for the salt which I left out completely.  Also added an extra 2 cups chicken broth (hence the tad more spices).  Lots you could do with this, but again, the recipe as written is excellent!  Thank you.  :)

I made this soup this evening, I used red lentils and followed the directions..lentils turned to "mush" however, the soup overall was very hearty and tasty. I quit cooking it after almost two hours due to the lentils falling apart..still tasted very good...if anyone has any suggestions on how I could have kept the lentils from falling apart please let me know or is that just a characteristic of red lentils...thanks..  hey this would have been good with a big piece of toasted french bread and some parmesan cheese on top..

Really good! A great general recipe for modifying.

Tweaked considerably by:
doubling the sausage,
adding 1/4 tsp fennel seed,
using half the lentils,
using stewed tomatoes,
adding potatos,
and adding some heavy whipping cream.

Also, we made rice on the side and mixed it in when plating.

Made this recipe as is (as I usually do first time trying any recipe) and it came out perfect. This soup is delicious as a whole meal. Yum!

Very good - used about 8 cups of homemade vegetable stock.   Nice change for us.   Will keep as an easy, winter crockpot meal.

I use this recipe as a base but had to tweak it for lack of ingredients. It still turned out delicious! Used beef broth instead of chicken and black beans in place of lentils.

Absolutely delicious! Even my 7-year-old loved this and took leftovers in his thermos to school! The only thing I changed was to add shredded chicken with the sausage. So delicious.

Yum! I followed the advice of others (Bakingnana) and used the full package of sausage (18-19oz) and all chicken broth (not water). It was a huge hit with my husband and the full house of surprise guests. We will make this soup again & again!

Delicious, satisfying, and leftovers freeze beautifully for those  days you don't want to cook.  I'd lost a recipe for Lentil Sausage skillet from the Pittsburgh Press in the 80's.  This from Allrecipes is the closest, maybe even better!  You can adjust liquids to make it somewhere between soup and stew.  And keep checking lentil doneness to your taste by dipping in during cooking time, and taking a little bite. The answer to friends' questions is: "No, you don't need to pre-cook lentils, only the sausages for little crispy edges.  I cut kielbasa in circles or little chunks.  Just rinse lentils first thru strainer.  Thanks Allrecipes for great recipe.

really good soup, I doubled the sausage too and cut it back to 6 cups of water, wanted it a little thicker.  Cooked in slow cooker all day, husband loved it.  Only thing I didn't use was thyme, just don't like the flavor of it.  Gets better next day and freezes really well, thank you for a great recipe.

My family loved this. I accidentally used hot sausage instead of sweet sausage. My husband bought it by mistake and my youngest son kept commenting on how the soup was really hot as he wolfed it down. I think I will use the sweet sausage next time, as I don't care for spicy hot so much. I also left out the tomatoes since my oldest does not like them, but am thinking I will add them if there is any soup left over. Also added barley instead of pasta. Trying to cut down on wheat, but I think it would be good either way. This is a soup that is easy to adjust to your own taste and could be changed up a little every time, so it does not get boring.

As I used red lentils, which cook in about 20 minutes, I cut out 2 cups of water and reduced the simmer time to 25 minutes. I also used about 4  cloves fresh garlic, a whole pound of mild Italian sausage and 1 1/2 cups shredded carrots. I ramped up the dry seasonings (except for salt) by 1/4 tsp. and I waited until I turned off the stove to add the fresh parsley. Delicious!

Just made this recipe and it turned out awesome.  I left out the onions and tomatoes due my sister-in-law's allergies and added extra garlic and celery.  I also doubled the amount of sausage. I used 1/4 tsp. of red pepper instead of black pepper and it gave it just the right amount of heat. I also tossed in some fresh spinach I had on hand.

Made this tonight for dinner, and it was pretty good. Not the best soup I've ever had, but definitely worth making again. I did turkey italian sausage, and had soaked my lentils overnight, so I only used about 1/2 the water called for. I did beef broth instead of chicken because that's what I had on hand, but other than that, I followed recipe ingredients. I cooked for 1 hr, and then after we ate I decided to let the leftovers cook another 45 minutes to see if the lentils would soften up anymore, but they stayed at about the same texture (which is semi-soft; they were a brownish green color) so I think that must be about as soft as they get, which I liked; DH would've liked a little softer. Other than that, very good!

Gave it 5 stars even though I made minor changes due to ingredients on hand.  Used herbs de provence instead of oregano, thyme and basil.  Used polish kielbasa sausage instead of italian and chopped carrots instead of shredding...and more of them.  Left out pasta and 2 cups of the water.  My hubby said this was the best soup he ever ate in his life!  I have to agree!  Must try!

I made this soup today following the recipe very closely.  The only change I made was using turkey sausage. I cooked the soup for 1.5 hrs.  The taste and texture was good.  I wish it was a little bit more tangy/spicy.  I will try making it again using different spices.

Absolutely a fantastic soup! Made it twice before and just getting around to reviewing it since it was dinner tonight. Like many reviewers, I too, used smoked turkey kielbasa (quartered) to save on a few calories. I needed to use up several ingredients in my fridge (organic spinach & carrot shreds, veggie broth and tomato paste), so this recipe allowed me a fridge clean-out tonight! I only had a 14.5oz can petite diced tomatoes, so I used that, along with the juice and a few heaping tablespoons of tomato paste to compensate for the lack of tomatoes. Omitted oregano (not a fan) and doubled up on basil. For the liquid, I used a combo of veggie broth and water (to which I added chicken base to taste). This soup makes a TON, so be prepared for leftovers (bonus!) and the aroma of this simmering soup is intoxicating (and I don't mean that literally, since I added in a couple glugs of a nice Pinot Noir I happened to be enjoying while making this soup). I was baffled, however, by the suggested cooking time. My HUGE pot was done in 40 minutes, lentils perfect. Served with garlic bread, this soup has consistently been a favorite in the fall/winter dinner rotation.

Fabulous! I didn't have celery or chicken broth and I used kielbasa instead of Italian sausage. I also added some frozen spinach.  This was perfect with some hot sauce, a spoon of sour cream and some grated cheese and served with garlic bread.  A new favorite.  My husband just went back for seconds.m

This is so good!!  I was worried my husband would not like it since it doesn't have a lot of meat in it, but he loves it!  He said the lentils taste meaty.  This is a great dish to stretch your food budget since lentils are cheap.  It really is more like a stew because it's pretty thick especially the next day.  Very flavorful, filling and good!

I love the sausage lentil soup from Carabba's, and even though this recipe is a bit different, it's still quite yummy. Adding shredded asiago and parmesan on top made it even better. Delicious!

Instead of pasta, I added a handful of barley. Delicious the first day, and awesome the second day ;)

This is a very tasty and light soup!  I did not have lentils only but used a mixed dry bean and used about 10 oz of those.  Only used 6 cups of water too and if it seems too watery for you add a can of tomato sauce with 1 tablespoon sugar to take to tomato edge off.  Great soup and flavors!

This soup was awesome! I made a few changes based on previous lentil soups I liked. I added tomato pasta, red pepper flakes and I chopped the carrot. Also I cooked the pasta on the side. And at the end I added red wine vinegar as I like something acidic with lentils.

This is the best soup. We always have some in the freezer at all times so we dont run out. If you want a little heat. I put in 1/2lb of hot sausage and 1/2lb of mild Italian sausage.

this was amazing. i was really skeptical the whole time becuase it's really not very good "looking", but it was really the best soup.

My changes:
1lb habanero chicken sausage
2 stalks of celery
6 cups of water
low sodium chicken broth
no salt added diced tomatos
1/2 tsp curry powder
red pepper flakes
no pasta

This was delicious. I had some kielbasa, so I used it instead of Italian sausage. It was still fab. I served it with basic white bread from the great "Baking with Julia" by, of course, Julia Child. I may add a pinch of sugar next time to offset the slight acidity of the tomatoes. Incidentally, it only took about 45 minutes for the lentils to become tender, not 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

Great recipe! I used a whole pound of sausage though -makes it a little more hearty. I browned the sausage and onion and celery in a pan and then added everything together in the crockpot and let it simmer for a few hours. Makes a ton!

We love, love, love this soup! I have shared the recipe with so many people who have tasted the soup when I have made it! Thank you so much for sharing. 

We do like our meals with a little spice, so I do add some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes. I also double the veggies (like the carrots, celery and onion). Instead of 8 cups of water, I usually use 4 cans of chicken broth for flavor. You could also add some fresh spinach if you like. 

AND, the trick is - you can let this soup cook on low all day long if you would like, but don't add the lentils until about 30-40 minutes before you want to serve it (that way, all the flavors come out and you don't wind up with mushy lentils). I usually serve with garlic bread, so I omit the ditalini. The leftover soup also freezes really well, we usually get 2-3 meals out of one big pot.

I love this soup.  Made it again today and found that I needed to add a little more garlic and black pepper about two hours in. I also added about 10-11 cups of water along with some bullion because I like mine a little more soupy and less thick.  I also used turkey sausage for the recipe.  An interesting twist might be adding small chunks of red potatoes instead of ditalini.....  And be careful of the thyme.  too much really comes out in the soup.

This was a big hit when I made it-- fed me and my boyfriend AND the neighbors for days, and still had leftovers to freeze! Didn't have chicken broth, so I used a chicken stock/cream of chicken combo and it still turned out great. Will definitely make again, as it was pretty easy and the results were well-received and plentiful. Yum!

I very much like this soup recipe and for an added kick I added some chili seasoning.  I think it is very good. My girlfriend gave me about 5 lbs. of lentils, so I will be making this soup quite a bit.

This turned out really delicious. I did make my own chicken broth (I just used bullion) and used dried parsley since that's what I had on hand. I also forgot the bay leaves. Even so, the flavors were great, and I can easily see myself making this again. Really filling, tasty, and it made a bunch. Thanks for sharing this.

Pretty good.  I made as stated, and did not add the optional pasta.  I did have an extra cup of chicken broth, so I used that to replace one of the cups of water.  I also had closer to 3/4 pound of sausage and used all of it.  It was hearty.  I think the next time I would slice the carrots instead of shredding though, and add some red pepper flake as some reviewers suggested.

No words can express how good this is! My father says this is better than Carrabbas recipe! Only thing I added was a jar of Sofrito (Goya- tomato base) It helped with thicking the soup as it simmered. Totally delicious!!!!!!!!

This soup was so good!  To save time, I started the lentils boiling separately while I browned the sausage and sauteed the veggies.  Start to finish was just under an hour.  I doubled the recipe to use up a whole pound of spicy sausage and it made a ton!

This is so yummy. I made as is except substituted Turkey Italian sausage and left out the pasta (only because I'm not a fan of how thick soup gets when pasta is added). Entire family loved this!

I made this as it was written and it lacked a depth of flavor.  I had to add some bullion to it and a lot more seasoning and then it started to fill out a little.   Next time I think I will double the sausage and use all broth instead of water.    All in all, though, it's good and we will definitely have it again!

For over 25 years my husband had been telling me how delicious lentil soup was.  I finally had some at Carraba's and loved it. Been looking for a recipe since then.  Another reviewers said this recipe came close to Carraba's soup, so I tried it out. Really, really tasty and this recipe lends itself well to personal adjustments. I added a LOT more pepper and  italian seasonings, used a full pound sweet italian sausage and more chicken broth instead of water. Gonna try hot italian sausage, leave out the pasta and cut recipe in half next time. Really tasty with warm crusty french bread dipped in quality extra virgin olive oil.  Yummy.

This makes a very big pot of soup.  The only changes made were to sub water for the broth and add a few beef boullion cubes.  Also added a package of fresh baby spinach.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Good recipe.  I did add pasta, sea shells since that's all I had, and it did absorb quite a bit of the broth which made it really thick.  I'll probably leave out next time, and yes there will be a next time.  :-)

We loved this.  I used mostly chicken broth and used slighly less liquid than called for.  I also used spicy sausage and added a little cayenne pepper.  It makes a ton!!!

Will definitely make this again.  Very flavorful and so healthy.  I used vegetable broth, veggie/soy chorizo and veggie sausage and added spinach and cracked red pepper.  Next time I'll add mushrooms for even more flavor. SO good.  Thanks for the great dinner.

This is a great recipe that cooks up pretty quickly because you don't need to soak lentils. I followed it pretty much as written except I seasoned it with more Moroccan-type seasonings--cumin, cayenne, paprika, ginger, cinnamon. Tasted great the first night and even better the next day.

This is a great recipe. It makes a ton. I gave some to a friend and froze some, but still had enough for a few meals for two. I didn't add any of the optional pasta because I didn't really think it needed pasta with the beans. I rarely ever keep a recipe the way it is, but I didn't alter this recipe one bit.

5 stars!
Excellent recipe. Followed it pretty closely, but added an extra rib of celery and some extra garlic.
I hit it with a hand blender for a few seconds to make it a little thicker.
Will definitely make this again!

A quicker recipe I used(I'll admit that I did not use this particular recipe) took only about 30 minutes to cook.  It tastes wonderful! use two 14oz cans reduced Na chicken broth, 1.5cup water (add more as needed), 1cup brown lentils rinsed and drained, 1cup sliced carrots, 1/2cup chopped onions, 1tsp snipped fresh thyme or 1/2tsp if dried, 1/8tsp grd red pepper (or red pepper sauce), 2 cloves minced garlic and 6ozs cooked smoked sausage, sliced.  combine everything except thyme and sausage and bring to a boil, then simmer covered for 20-25 mins until lentils/veggies are tender.  stir in fresh thyme and sausage and heat through.  My son LOVED this and it will definitely be in my repertoire! Serves 5.

This was soooo yummy!  I used 1/2 the pasta that the recipe called for and 1/2 the salt as well.  I'm probably going to have to add a little more chicken broth when i go to eat the leftovers tonight b/c it's really thick.  Def will make this again!

I used a couple of Buddy's chicken sausages, and since I only had half a bag of lentils, I added about 1/2 cup of pearl barley. Reduced liquid to 6 cups. Sauteed the veggies in a little olive oil, then put everything in my crock pot and simmered on Hi for about 3 hours before adding the tomatoes. It cooked up to a thick stew, and the aroma was tantalizing.  I tasted before putting it in the fridge and plan to heat it up for dinner tonight.  Very good.

Great flavor!  I used 1/2 lb of hot Italian sausage as the recipe suggested.  Then I added chunks (1/2 lb) of cooked sausage in its casing. I also used 4 cups water and 4 cups beef boullion, in addition to the suggested 2 cans of beef broth.  I deleted added salt and the results were impressive.  Everyone enjoyed this recipe and I will definitely make this again.  Also, to increase the heat a bit, I added some red pepper flakes to portion for a family member who prefers hot flavors.  Amazing recipe.  Thank you!!!

Instead of adding 8 cups water, 2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth, & 1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, I added 8 cups of chicken broth, 2 cups water, and 1 small spicy V8. Plus I used hot sausage instead of italian & added spinach instead of ditalini. Delicious!

I love this soup but did incorporate some changes.  I doubled the herbs and chopped garlic and also the sausage (I used turkey sausage). I used all chicken broth instead of water.   I decreased the salt. I made it in the crock pot and added fresh spinach in the last hour.  Next time I will leave the sausage in bigger clumps when I brown it to make more of a contrast to the lentils.  I also added rice at the end instead of pasta because I had some cooked rice on hand. This soup freezes very well and obviously is easy to change to suit your family's likes and dislikes!

I loved this soup! It's so filling and it just warms you up. It also made the house smell wonderful. I substituted turkey sausage and used the veggies I had on hand. Keep checking the lentils while cooking... I only had to simmer for about an 1 hour and 1/2 before they were done.

Definitely makes enough for the whole family and such a great source of protein.  I made it without the pasta and it was still nice and hearty.  My husband also liked this recipe.  I added one chicken boullion cube instead of salt for additional flavor.  Delicious!!

I loved this recipe.  I ended up adding more sausage just because I had more.  I left out the can of diced tomatoes because I didn't have any.  It was great.  I probably should have added more liquid, it was pretty dry after adding noodle (i used bow tie, because it was what I had.)  I didn't have to cook it very long either, about 1 and half hours.  No big deal though when we reheated we added liquid and it was still great.  Thank you for the recipe I will make it again and again.

Just what I was looking for!  Browned turkey sausage and veggies and then threw everything (minus pasta) into the slow cooker for about 4-5 hours on high.  Added a pound of spinach and already cooked pasta to finish it off at the end.  Note: this is very thick if you add the noodles, next time I might add more liquid to make it more "soup-like."  I also almost doubled the amount of oregano, basil, and thyme.  Thanks for sharing!

Terrific soup! I diced the carrot, used hot sausage and less tomato. So tasty!! I think spinach or some other green veg would be good and add color. Next time I will try this with rice and less broth for a casserole dish. Will make again!!

Yum Delicious!!! I'll give it 5 Soup Spoons.  Very versatile soup, easy to prepare and a joy to eat on a cold winter evening.  Minor changes I make to the recipe next time will be the addition of some more sausage. Otherwise, I'll leave it as is.  Enjoyed by all. Will make it again.

For me this came out to be something that was not soup (which I am miffed about, since I don't think I had it on too high of a temperature), but what came out was still quite good. I will definitely make this hearty, cold-weather meal again, whether it turn out to be soup or otherwise.

This was sooo good! Great for a cold day. It is a real rib sticker. I Did do a couple of changes. I added more sausage and a quater of that was hot. I also used beef broth. I made this 3 times in the past couple of weeks One day I did add spinach and the other escarole,
                Thanks

I thought this soup was fantastic.  Simple to make, tastes great, and is perfect for fall weather.  I served it with fresh bread and needed nothing more.  I will be sharing this recipe with others.  The only changes I made were to use a full pound of mild sausage and more chicken broth in place of the water.  Thanks for sharing!

I added two pounds of hot Italian sausage and used beef broth instead of chicken broth.  A wonderful soup for a chilly fall evening.

My whole family loved this recipe - including my 11 month old (don't worry, we didn't give him sausage). I am trying to introduce more legumes into our diet and we don't normally eat any, but this soup was a huge hit. We used regular sausage since we don't like Italian and it came out great.  We ate it with multiple times and still had enough to freeze a large batch.

This soup had an awesome flavor!  I ommitted the carrots for the sake of time, and it also only took an hour for the lentils to get tender.  Next time I make this (and there WILL be a next time) I will add some spinach towards the end.

This is a really great recipe that was easy to work with.  I added yellow split pea with the lentils and instead of diced tomatoes I used tomato paste.  The soup is absolutely delicious!!!

This soup is so tasty! I used low-sodium chicken broth and omitted the salt based on other peoples advice. I also only put in about 3/4 the lentils since I dislike lentils. This is the first lentil soup I have liked so I will definately make it again!

Wonderful soup!  The flavour is excellent.  I usually just use whatever type of sausage I have on hand.  I've also made it without the sausage and it's still great.

This is a great recipe and has become a stable for cold days at our house. I find doubling the recipe with extra meat works nicely and use extra broth to replace the water for added flavor. I’ve utilized frozen mirepoix works nicely, as well.

Our family loved this recipe I’m shocked because my husband even loved it and he doesn’t like anything! The differences I made were as follows... I used vegan sausages instead of real sausage,  crushed tomatoes instead of the diced and at the end I added a can of white beans and a few handfuls of spinach to bulk it up even more.  Great recipe!

Wonderful! My package of sausage was a little over a pound, so I thought I'd double the recipe, until I saw how much water and broth it called for. So I doubled the meat and veggies, but not the lentils and fluids. It almost filled my 6 qt. InstaPot (I used Saute and Slow Cooker options). I had grated Parmesan cheese (not the powdery stuff) and it worked great on top of the soup. I realized the next day that I forgot the pasta. I never missed it.

First of all I made this soup in my crock pot and second I had no celery or carrots  or thyme or onion. I used onion powder. I added 4 cups of water and 2 boxes of chicken broth to the cooker. Then I added cut up sausage. I added bay leaves and rinsed off lentils.. I let simmer on high for about two hours then added the seasonings and tomatoes. Last I added orzo because I didn't have ditalini. I'm proud of how this soup turned out since I've never eaten lentil soup or made it before!

My son and husband really liked it but a 4 rather than 5 stars, my husband says, because he would've liked it more with pork sausage (i used sweet italian chicken sausage).  I added more broth and less water.  I doubled the sausage as many others did.  After browning the sausage and veggies on the pan, I threw everything into the crockpot for 4 hours, minus the tomatoes until the last hour.  I didn't have parsley.  I didn't do pasta as family trying to cut back on carbs.  I added extra seasoning.  I didn't sprinkle with cheese and I think they would have liked that.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I made this soup using 3/4 lb green onion pork sausage.  I added 2 tsp cumin and 2 tsp sweet curry to give it an extra flavor boost.  Got rave reviews and will be making this again.

I made this soup and it was really very good (but gassy, lentils?). I made it in the crock pot, was super easy. I did substitute pepperoni for the sausage. My husband's mom used to do that so I wanted to do that for him. He loved it!

Wonderful soup full of delicious flavors! I made this several years ago and could not find the recipe. Luckily, I went into my Allrecipes recipe box and found it.  I will make it again this winter. Such a hearty meal!

As with most soups with sausage I think much of the flavor has to do with the flavor of the sausage you start with since it imparts so much to the broth.  I ended up having to add a significant amount of Italian seasoning, rosemary, and red pepper flakes to get this soup up to par.  I cut the water back by 2 cups, doubled the sausage, chopped the carrots instead of shredding as many suggested, and ended up adding a can of tomato sauce to bulk up the broth.  The lentils cooked far more slowly than did the pasta so by the time the soup was ready the pasta had disintegrated.  All of that being said, I did follow the basic recipe and my family loved it.

Excellent recipe. I doubled the amount of sausage, used two stalks of celery, and added a bag of fresh spinach that I chopped up before adding to the pot. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. I will make this again and again.

Good! Not Carrara’s lentil soup good but delicious nonetheless. I followed the recipe exactly but used hot Italian sausage and added some red pepper flakes/cayenne. As good as you’re going to get! And this made a ton so I froze a lot and we will eat it again in the future

Awesome soup - have made it a few times for over 100 people at the homeless shelter I work at. Clients love it and come back for seconds (and thirds). It is a great way to sneak in some extra protein and nutrition by adding lentils - highly recommend giving it a shot!

Very flavorful! Did not add pasta though due to the soup appearing pretty thick already. Didn’t want the pasta to absorb all the liquid. I used all chicken broth. (9 3/4 Cups total). 1 lb. Italian Sausage, and 14 ozs. Of lentils was plenty.

I made this with turkey Italian sausage, omitted the salt and added red pepper flakes for extra zing.  Otherwise, I left everything else the same.  It also didn't require the 3 hour cooking time. Delicious, even on a hot summer day.

Set aside enough time (3 hours) to make this delicious soup. It is worth it, and extras can be frozen. I made the pasta separately, so that it wouldn’t absorb the remaining liquid and soften. I added some baby spinach and grated Parmigiano Reggiano  and Romano cheese at the end, as well as some crushed red pepper for  a little heat. Delicious!

I used a full pound of sausage, cut back on water and added more tomatoes. I used two ribs of celery and added a finely chopped carrot.  I also left the cilantro out because we have one guest who hates the taste.  We added it to part of the batch.  

It was great the first time and the leftovers were even better.

Delicious. The only change I made is chicken broth instead of the water and I used a bit less lentils than what it calls for. I used green lentils and they were cooked in about 1 hr at very low heat.  This recipe yields a lot!

I skipped the salt and reduced the chicken stock, added a bit more tin tomatoes than the recipe. I thought it was a bit salty still but my hubby and the youngest daughter really liked it. I liked it as well but maybe a little less chicken stock next time. Over all, very hearty and delicious soup that's prefect for the frigid weather that we are having this winter.

my family Loved it. Even my picky eater said please make again.  Made it almost as written, but sausage doubled only because I was lazy and didn't separate pkg to half lb.  wouldn't have mattered. so yummy and total comfort food. did top off each bowl with a decent reggiano (only cuz I had on hand, rare), very nice touch but not necessary for the "this is a winner" category at home.  I wasn't excited about shredding the carrot but did it with a hand grater (would have taken longer with finding parts of food processer thing that in my house requires cleaning both before and after). I liked the shredded carrot in it. this is going into not only soup/lunch mix, but dinner too, and to bring to family.  (I did not add the pasta)

My Husband loves Carrabba’s Lentil and Sausage soup so when I came across this recipe, I knew that I had to make it.  It was really easy to prepare.  Instead of the Italian sausage, I used chicken chorizo sausage and I didn’t use any water, only chicken bone stock.  My whole family enjoyed it

This was the perfect recipe to introduce me to cooking with Lentils. I used the full lb of Italian sausage instead of 1/2 (it would've gone to waste) and I omitted the carrots because my family is full of picky eaters. They loved it!

I love lentils and usually just cook them with garlic, celery and onions.  This soup was a definite keeper.  Followed the recipe Exactly except ,used turkey sausage.  Definitely will make It again but maybe spice it up a bit with red pepper flakes.

I   didn't have any celery, but I followed the recipe exactly other than that. My husband said it was great, and he's fussy about his soup! I will be making this again.

The first time I make a recipe, I follow it with no changes. This is a great recipe. The next time I am going to use more spices.

I used a meatless Italian sausage made  by Tofurkey.  It worked beautifully.  I sliced 3 sausages thinly before browning them in the skillet.

Yummy! This is my first review after years of trying recipes from Allrecipes. I thought this soup was  good. Like others, I increased the amount of sausage, and used both hot and sweet Italian sausage. I'm perplexed by the reviewer that could only taste sausage... I think the herbs, spices and seasoning were fantastic and flavourful.  I used an immersions blender to thicken it a bit, and also tried the addition of a tater tot (as recommended on the site) when I reheated a single portion today. So good. And pretty healthy in the big scheme of things: lots of fibre and protein. Will definitely make again.

I thought this would make a ton so I halved the ingredients. Turned out great. I used orzo for the pasta which soaked up a lot of the broth so I'll need to add more to the leftovers when I re-heat.

The lentils fell apart and became mushy and unrecognizable. The recipe needed some additional flavors. I added rotel tomatoes and corn. We enjoyed the meal but it was not recognizable.

Wonderful soup! Based on reviews I decided to modify it a little by reducing the water to 5 cups and increasing chicken broth to 32 ounces.  I added a whole pound of Italian sausage and am glad I did.  I only put in one teaspoon of salt and no pasta.  The whole family loved it, even my picky kids.

Made it as written, except I used Italian seasoned canned  tomatoes instead of regular and omitted the spices (except garlic, salt, pepper). Very tasty, and the family loved it.

Soup was delicious!  Next time I would increase the amount of sausage and use a little bit of hot sausage as well to give it some warmth.  And, I used the immersion blender on it for a minute to help thicken it.  I will definitely make again!

This soup was delicious. I made it according to the recipe, except I sliced/diced the carrots instead of shredding them. It cooked in just over an hour from the time it came to a boil. The whole family ate it and enjoyed it.

I changed a few things. Used dried parsley.  Chicken broth no water. Added spinach, kale  and collard blend. Also used Muir Glen chunky tomato sauce instead .  Turned out amazing. Cut down the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.

Good, but I always make changes. I like it more filling, so I cut up at least 4 carrots and celery stalks, I do 8 cups chicken broth (I use 'better than bouillon') and 2 cups water, omit salt. Delicious every time :-)

I changed the sausage to chicken spinach & feta sausage as well as some chicken Italian sausage thus doubling the sausage. In addition, I omitted two cups of water and I did not add the pasta  plus mixed in some extra basil and garlic. I also made it in a slow cooker!

This is a great dish.  Didn't read the comments before I started and decided to make it to the letter.  Next time I would up the sausage, and add spinach, and or kale.  Wesneak that into about everything.

This soup is amazing. So hearty and delicious.  I omitted celery, sliced baby carrots into coins and used two cans of huntz celery, green pepper and onion tomatoes. I also used one box of progresso Tuscan chicken broth and one regular. I only used four cups water. It was ready in about an hour and a half.

Everyone in the family loved this soup. I doubled the amount of sausage, added more celery and carrots and added an extra can of chicken broth and more water . I also added some dry mustard, it really took it to the next level!  Didn't add pasta but very hardy soup and delicious!

This is one of the best soups I have ever tasted! And I usually don't like lentil soup. Fantastic - added the pasta too. It was very thick and yummy. Used turkey sausage because I don't eat pork. Never missed the cheese sprinkled on top. Will definitely make again - now a family favorite!

One of the many great weaknesses of the English system of measurement is the ounce, which can be either a unit of weight or a unit of volume.  This recipe calls for a "16 oz. package of lentils."  Well, I buy lentils in bulk, so I had to figure out what this element of the recipe meant. A little online shopping revealed that lentils are always sold by weight, so the author is calling for a pound of lentils.  It also turns out that a pound of lentils occupies about 2 1/3 cups in volume.

Just made this and my family loved it. Since I like a real thick, hearty stew, I doubled the sausage and added the pasta. If you use quicker cooking lentils as well, you won't have to cook it as long. It was delicious!

Absolute killer soup! Easy to make and I followed the recipe closely except for a little extra sausage since I had it.  Also, just used a tsp of salt preferring individual seasoning.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I thought the 1tbs salt was too much so I put in 1/2 tbs and it was still too much, less next time and I put half of the soup in the blender at the end.  Everyone loved it, it will be a regular staple in our house...

I used 1 lb of Turkey sausage, one extra stalk of celery, and 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper, and only 1/2 tbsp of salt.  It only took about 45 minutes to cook once it was simmering.  Next time I might try a full tsp of crushed red pepper, but I LOVE this soup!  It tasted so good.  This will be made often.

I highly recommend that you do NOT put the 1 TBSP of salt in this soup. You can always add salt to taste, but you can't take it out if it's too much!

Having said that, this soup is very good. I was looking for something to use up all the lentils I have. I used double the meat (like several others did as well). I used one Jimmy Dean Sage sausage and one Jimmy Dean (store brand, actually) of the spicy sausage. The spicy sausage really brings the heat! I'm glad I didn't add red pepper flakes. I left out the celery.

I used all the water and broth/stock it called for and also did not drain the tomatoes. It still was a thick soup. Also, this didn't take long to cook. The lentils were soft in about an hour or so.

Oh, I didn't bother with using any pasta. I chopped the carrots rather than shred them and used a bit more carrots. I forgot to grate my Romano cheese over my bowl. I will do this next time.

Very good recipe that you can tweak if you'd like or just go with it as-is (just please don't add all that salt!). This is a keeper and I made up a batch to freeze for easy meals later.

This was fantastic.  Best lentil soup I've ever had, and it gets better by the day.  This time I added two cans of great northern beans - rinsed - they added some nice variety of texture and taste.

Holy moly! The soup isn't even out of the pot and I'm already floored at how delicious it is! Wow! I grew up with lentil soup with lemon and potatoes, and wanted to try something new. This is so much yummier! I only had half a red onion so I used that, and I used ten cups of water with 4 tsp chicken base. I didn't add any salt and it's completely perfect the way it is. I love the texture of sausage with lentils. It's so cold tonight in SoCal, for once, and this is the perfect soup for such fine weather. A new staple in our home for sure!

Yep, it's a keeper. I've made this soup for years, but without the sausage -  the family likes it even better with it.  I also left out the pasta and cut back on the water. Thanks!

This soup has a great flavor, but the sausage is just a bit too much. I'd cut it in half (or less).

Made this for dinner tonight.  I used Field Roast vegan Italian sausage and I cooked it for 4 hours on high in my slow cooker. I otherwise followed the recipe.  We liked it a lot. The Italian sausage is a nice addition  I will definitely make it again.

It's one of our family favorites!  But the type of sausage you use will make or break this recipe.  Try different kinds until you find one you like.

This is a very good and hearty soup.  I used regular sausage because I'm allergic to one of the spices in Italian sausage.  Also, I sweated the veggies before adding: Saute onion, celery and carrots in a little olive oil for about 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the garlic to the last 3 minutes.  Some hints about lentils:  1) Use low/no salt broth and don't add salt while the lentils cook.  Salt prevents lentils from getting soft.  2) Yellow, red and orange lentils get mushy when boiled while brown and green lentils stay a bit firmer.  To help prevent mushiness, toast the lentils for about 10 minutes before adding to the pot (being careful not to burn them).  Or saute them with the veggies.

My husband gave this recipe a thumbs up. He really likes the sausage and lentil soup at Carrabba's and always orders it instead of the salad. He said this is as close it could get. I chopped the carrots instead of shredding. Was worried that the tablespoon of salt would be too much, but it wasn't. Did add about 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes as others suggested and it spiced it up just right. Did cut back on liquid as others suggested and used 8-1/2 cups of all chicken broth, no water used. Didn't add the pasta because it was already a lot of soup for the two of us. Would need the extra liquid if pasta was added. Plenty enough left to freeze for later. We didn't even know we liked lentils. Great recipe!

I used jalapeno cheddar deer smokies instead of the Italian sausage and it turned out really well.  I also used canned lentils instead of dry and just added them near the end of cooking.

Loved this recipe... Reminds me of my grandmas recipe... I only made half of it but didn't half all the ingredients exactly to keep the taste I wanted.  Yet it was still enough for two with leftovers for another person or two... I served it with white rice like my grandma used to... M m m

First off, 2-3 hours is too long. I loosely followed this recipe and it was done in half the time while holding some of the liquid so it wasn't mush. I didn't have the Italian seasonings so I used Rosemary and Turmeric instead and it came out very good.

Not my favorite lentil soup, but it was still very tasty. I used venison sausage.

only change I made was using hickory smoked sausage instead of sweet italian suausage because thats what I had on hand. I felt the pasta was a bit much. It turned a bit thick to be soup but stew is spot on.

What a hearty,  delicious not to mention economical soup!  Lentils are a great source of protein.  It makes a "ton" so you may want to modify it unless you want to freeze it.  I made one slight change to it though.  I increased the chicken stock so that it was half water, half stock.  I think it made a richer soup even though the sausage makes it pretty rich already.    We have enough to freeze for a cold winter night.  YUM!

I was looking for something a little different and this did not disappoint! I used 1/2 pound of sweet and 1/2 pound hot italian sausage. I also used 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper and added some kale. My 15 year old and my husband loved it. Delicious! I will definitely make this again :)

YUM! I made a few minor modifications, causing a less-than-perfect result, but still delicious. And I'm sure it would be perfectly tasty as-written too. I used Turkey sausage, not double, but maybe 30-50% more. I used diced fresh tomato instead of canned, added a chopped zucchini because I had extra laying around. I also cut the carrots into rounds and used 2 stalks of celery, and used Orzo pasta. I messed up a bit on when to add which veggies, and how long to simmer. I overdid the veggies, and a bit too much of the broth simmered off because I was paranoid that it was too watery so I simmered it for about 15 minutes without a lid. I shouldn't have done that- now it's a bit stew-like, but still tastes GREAT. I served it with Romano Cheese and a French baguette. PUT ROMANO CHEESE ON TOP! It adds a whole new, amazing dimension to the soup! I will make this again for sure!

This soup is great!  Even my extremely picky daughter loved it.  I changed the recipe very little: I used spicy bulk Italian sausage instead of the sweet and increased it to about 3/4 lb.  I didn't put in the pasta (mainly because I forgot it at the store), but instead put in a can of kidney beans, which didn't really change the flavor, just added a little color.  I will definitely make this soup again!

I made this as is except I omitted the parsley and thyme...didn't have either and I only used half of the garlic powder.  I thought a TBS. plus the fresh garlic was going to be a little too much for my breath to handle the next day.  I tried to do this in the crock pot, but after 6 hours the lentils still weren't tender.  It really needs to be at an active simmer to cook those little guys.  The flavor in this was fantastic and be sure to add the cheese (I used parmesan...didn't have romano) because it really adds a nice creaminess and zip. This was a great soup that I will definitely make again.

I made it according to the recipe. I would do two things: less salt, maybe 1/4 and some crushed red pepper flakes for more spice. I used more sausage as you can't buy it in partial pounds. I also forgot the pasta, but it was plenty thick. Great soup.

This soup is great!  I did not have Italian sausage on hand, so I used ground turkey burger and added seasonings used to make sausage.  I added 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp sage, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper, and 1/8 tsp cayenne to the turkey meat and browned.  I also used 3 chopped carrots instead of shredded, and I didn't have fresh parsley on hand, so I used dry.  I only had half the amount of tomatoes and lentils on hand, so that is what I used.  I did not have celery on hand either, but we were very pleased with the outcome!  I do think that I will continue to make it with the turkey burger though as a healthier option.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This soup was delicious and so easy to make! I followed the recipe to the tee and it definitely makes more than 10 servings. My husband said it even tasted better than his grandmother's Bulgarian version. I will definitely be making this again.

Great soup! Only changes I made was to add chicken broth instead of water. Added 3/4 the amount of lentils because I wanted  more broth. Did not add the canned tomatoes or pasta. Loved it. Served with garlic bread.

It was good. Made it with italian seasoning and added some red pepper flakes for more spice. It was a great and easy recipe, but it didn't do too much for me. Maybe I'll add the pasta next time and then try again. 4 stars for the recipe!

Exactly what I wanted to make for dinner.  I had some Italian sausage and lentils and was searching for a soup recipe.  This was delicious.  I used my slow cooker.  I added some frozen chopped spinach just because.  I also gave each bowl a squirt of lemon juice and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Hot bread and this hearty soup made for a great cold night's dinner.

I used 1 lb of sausage and added 3 cloves of garlic to the onions as others had suggested.    I found that there was no need for that much sausage as the soup itself is so tasty.  I would also puree the diced tomatoes next time as I didn't enjoy having the larger chunks when all other vegetables were much smaller.    The soup is wonderfully tasty and very easy to make.  It was a crowd pleaser in my home.

Fantastic! I had a lonely leek in the fridge so I threw that in with the onion and celery. Used all broth, no water. And I didn't have any sausage at all, so I made meatballs using one lb ground pork seasoned with 1 Tbsp chopped garlic and 1 tsp Italian Seasoning and 1/2 tsp basil. I let that sit for the first hour while the soup simmered, then dropped the 1/2 inch meatballs into the bubbling soup, cooked another half hour. I also added 1 tsp white sugar as I always do to soups with diced tomatoes. Omitted the pasta and completely forgot about the cheese. Outstanding, a keeper, thanks Angchick!

This was super easy to make and TASTY!  I didn't have ground pork so I substituted breakfast sausage links and it was still TASTY.  Mine made much more than 10 servings though, so we had quite a bit of leftovers.

My whole family loved this.  I divided the soup in half and put in two pots and then added Aidells Chicken Apple Sausage from Costco to one pot and yukon gold potatoes to the other since I wanted some of it to be vegetarian.  I also used Veg broth.    I only had two cans of 14 oz diced tomatoes, and didn't have parsley and it still turned out great.    I will make this again and again.

This soup is so delicious!  Just like the fancy restaurant without the fancy price.  Very good job with the seasonings, my husband did not even add salt.  Will make more often now that I know how easy & delicious it is.

Angchick, thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I made it today as in CT we haven;t seen sun since Sat. the only things I changed were to ise scallions and minced dried onions as I was out of real onions, and I added about 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes. Also, out of spinach but had some arugula I needed to use and used that. Minor changes. This is sooooo good. Even my kids are eating it. This really is sooo good, I cooked the sausage slow on med heat and got a great fond on the bottom of the pan, not burnt a bit, and it deglazed beautifully.

This soup is wonderful!! My kids love it too.  I didn't have celery in the house so I skipped it.  Also used 8 cups of water and chicken base.  Instead of hot sausage I used regular sausage - I bet it is even better with hot sausage.

This was REALLY yummy. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I only omitted 3 cups of water because my pot was just not big enough! Still plenty of liquid though - just a little thicker and heartier of soup. Perfect! Thanks!

This soup was so tasty! When I started making the soup, I realized that I only had 1 can of chicken broth left and didn't have time to run to the store. So I just used the 1 can and 6 cups of water (instead of the 8 cups). I also used 3 hot sausages and the herbs were all fresh from my garden. I did not add the pasta. Thanks for the recipe!

I hate giving a bad review so I am really happy to say this is a great recipe. I used turkey sausage and left out the onion. My husband is allergic to pork and onions. Other than that I made very little changes. I used crushed tomatoes and after letting it simmer on low for 3 hours I had to add more water. My husband didn't think he would like it but he wound up loving it. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

DELICIOUS!  I used the pasta which was a nice addition.  The pasta really soaked up the great flavor. My husband liked it but didn't rave over it.  I might add more sausage next time.

This is a great recipe!  I left out the optional pasta and the onion - that was the only deviation.  This was soooooo good. I served it with grated cheese and fresh bread.  Mmmmmm.  Thanks!

I made this for a "soup-a-bowl" day at work.  Everyone that tried it loved it.  I did make some changes though:  used 1 lb of sweet sausage and reversed the broth and water.  Since I made it the night before, I did not add the pasta until the morning while it was warming up in the crock pot.  In the future, I think I'd make it with hot sausage for some heat or turkey sausage for healthy instead.  I may also add some kale or spinach and delete the pasta.  Overall, a great easy soup that freezes well for leftovers.  I will make again.

I used more chicken broth and less water but left everything else the same.  It was really good and my husband was glad we had leftovers when he came back from a business trip.  I always seem to cook the good stuff when he's out of town :-)

I loved this and was searching for something like Carraba's.  I agree with others that red pepper flakes would make it almost exactly the same.  I didn't add any because I don't have them on hand, next time I will.  I doubled the sausage and chopped garlic.  I was a little confused about the celery.  The entire package of celery said it was one stalk wich looked like a ton and one rib did not seem like enough.  So, I trimmed the celery down a lot and went ahead and used the whole stalk.  It seemed great this way to me.  We will make this soup all the time now, it is a new favorite!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent soup.  I did add a shake or two of red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.  Served with a green salad and garlic bread.  Wonderful meal for a winter day.

Delicious!  My husband likes the lentil and sausage soup at Carrabbas and he says it tasted just like theirs.  Like others wrote, I used more sausage (4 links of sausage, removed casings), used only chix broth for more flavor (3-32 oz. boxes did it), I pureed the can of tomatoes because I didn't want tomato chunks and I added red pepper flakes for a little kick.  It turned out great, but be forewarned that it makes A LOT.  My kids didn't like it, so my husband and I are the only ones eating it..I'll probably have to freeze some for another time.

I was looking for a lentil soup like Mom used to make, but discovered this one's even better.  Mom and Dad thought so too!  My only change was using a reduced-fat sausage, doubling it and slicing it before cooking.  The recipe also needed salt.  We had a meal for 6 and then froze the rest for a future meal.  Lots of food, not a lot of work.

This recipe is wonderful. I have made it quite a few times and get rave reviews everytime it's made. However, I do make a few changes. I like to double the sausage and use half sweet and half hot. I also cook the pasta seperately and add it in the bowls when serving, it seems to suck up most of the juice especially when it's been in the fridge for a couple days. It freezes well and always comes out great. I can't wait to make it for my oh' so picky mother-in-law tomorrow. I'm sure she'll finally be impressed with my cooking :-)

I think I would actually give this 3 1/2 or 3 3/4 stars.  It was good, but I prefer my lentil soup to be thicker.  I like the lentils to break down.  With this recipe, I could see all the individual lentils.  They softened up and tasted fine, but they didn't break down the way I expected them to. This was my first time making lentil soup, so maybe you need a different type of lentil or different preparation to get the kind of consistency I was expecting.  The ingredients are very nice, but the soup will definitely need some salt for flavor.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  The best lentil soup I've ever had.  The only thing I changed was to use about 1/4 cup of fresh basil instead of the dried.  I love basil and I think it was wonderful with this change.  This is definitely going to be a regular at our house!  The kids loved it too.

First time I made this I found it to be a little bit on the bland side.  The next time I made it I increased the sausage to 2 lbs. and increased the chopped garlic, parsley, oregano, and basil.  I eliminated the thyme and the garlic powder.  Delicious!  I make tons of this during the Fall and Winter seasons and always keep some in individual containers in the freezer so we always have some on hand.

THIS SOUP IS GREAT BUT NEXT TIME I WILL
NOT ADD ANY SALT.  CHICKEN BROTH IS SALTY
ENOUGH. ALSO, ADDED 1 EXTRA TEASPOON OF
GARLIC POWDER AND USED HOT ITALIAN SAUSAGE INSTEAD OF SWEET. GOES GREAT WITH
A BIG HUNK OF CRUSTY ITALIAN BREAD.

Pretty good soup, but not quite great.  I used all chicken stock in place of water, used mild sausage in place of sweet, and added extra herbs plus a beef bullion cube.  At first it looked like WAY too much liquid but it cooked down nicely. Made a huge amount so I'm going to freeze half.  Would/will make again.

The recipe as written is fair to good , but with some changes it can be a 5 star recipe. I made it with a full lb of sausage, also used the ditalini pasta( which makes it much more filling, plus higher calories! , will leave the pasta out out the next time). It still lacked in flavor until I sprinkled on the  parmesan cheese, that is needed. I will make again but with few more changes as did other reviewers.My husband loved it!

YUMMY!  Has become a regular on our menu.  I modified a bit, using 1lb spicy sausage, and all broth instead of water.  Great for leftovers.

this was so good!  I used chopped smoked sausage instead, as it was what I had, and just chopped the veggies to uniform size before sweating them with the browned sausage.  Then I added the rest, but only used about 7 cups of liquid total, so that it is really dense.  Also, I didn't use the pasta.  Served it with cornbead and salad.  Delish!

My wife tried this recipe tonight, we are eating it right now as a matter of fact, and it is great! Only thing she did was use 1lb. of sausage instead of 1/2lb. I'm sure we will be having this again!

Delicious. Quick, easy and healthy. My advice if you want to have less fat (the only fat there is is the sausage) is to chop the sausage into tiny pieces so you get 'more' sausage with each mouthful.

I ADDED 2 TABLESPOONS OF TOMATOE PASTE BECAUSE IT WAS VERY BLAND. ALSO 1/2 TSP. HOT PEPPER FLAKES, 1 1/2 TSP. BASIL & OREGANO. ALSO 3 BEEF BOUILLION CUBES.   IT ONLY TOOK 1 HOUR TO COOK.  I COOKED THE DITALINI SEPARATELY AND ADDED IT TO THE INDIVIDUAL BOWLS OF SOUP.  LEFTOVERS NEED MORE BROTH.  NEXT TIME I MAKE THIS, I WILL CHOP THE CARROTS IN SMALL DICE INSTEAD OF GRATING THEM.

Loved this soup, as did all who tried it! Was simple and quick. I added extra sausage, garlic, celery, carrots and onions, a bit more spices than it called for and it was perfect.

it was ok...  i reduced the tomatoes  by half and added a little extra celery and Hot italian sausage.  Instead of shredding the carrots, i sliced it similar size of celery , sausage, and tomatoes for a uniform look and sauteed them with the celery and onion.  Due to the acid in the tomatoes, it could delay the tenderizing of the lentils, so i didnt put them in until i did the pasta.    Slightly decreased salt, and slightly increased all other spices.  Made a big pot, lots of leftovers.

I made this is the crockpot and I would probably make it on the stove next time. Everything was delicious, except the sausage came out tasting watery. I also omitted the carrots and the pasta.

I cooked the lentils separately and add them to the soup and simmer for about 30 minutes to save on time and it's great!

I made this without the pasta. And I cooked it longer than what was in the recipe, to evaporate off some of the liquid. It made the best pot of lentil soup I've ever tasted!

This soup is so flavorful. I made minor changes only because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I added cheese tortellinis (sooo good). I also added a can of tomato sauce and a 14oz can of diced tomato instead of the 28oz can of tomato. I also used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. It is such a delicious soup and my husband loved it.

I made this just as in the recipe and it turned out great at first, but an hour after it sat in the pot it got all thick, more like a side dish than a soup.  I would reccomend putting in a lot more liquids.  I had to throw it away as no one ate the rest LOL

great recipe! i cross-refrenced the ingredients list of this recipe with a similar recipe from here in argentina, and the only thing they do different is add about a handful each of red and green bell peppers. i found it the taste was a complement to the soup added some color too. i cant find chicken stock here so i always substitute by using chicken bouillon cubes instead.. i think in this dish i used a total of 4, and obviously had no need for extra salt.
thanks!

Absolutely DELISH!!!  I took the water down a few cups and it was VERY heart - a nice stew!!  I also added a lot more sausage.  About 3/4 a lb but I halved the recipe - but I wanted it to be a nice hearty dinner on a cold winter day.  The spices and tomatoes made this absolutely so yummy and very budget friendly!

This is fanastic!  My family loves this, thank you.  I doubled the amount of sausage, and used chicken broth for the water.  It turned out thick and delicious.

This was fabulous!!  I will most definitely make this again and again.  I left out the carrots and the optional pasta, and it was delicious!  Even better the next day as leftovers!  You will not regret making the effort on this one!

I cut back on the salt as others have suggested.  I wasn't sure about the taste of the soup as I have never made lentil soup before.  The soup won rave reviews at a church potluck. I used andouille sausage in place of Italian.

Wonderful!  This soup was very flavorful and perfectly spiced.  I had regular breakfast sausage on hand and so I spiced that with some Italian seasoning and used it.  This made a huge amount of soup.  We will no doubt be eating on these leftovers for a week.
