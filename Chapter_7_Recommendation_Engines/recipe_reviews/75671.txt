My husband raved about this recipe; he said it was the best salmon he'd ever eaten! I liked it a lot too. 

I made just a couple of changes. I used about half of the olive oil and butter the recipe called for; I don't think you need the extra fat. I also used fresh lemon juice and regular pepper instead of the lemon pepper. I sauteed some  minced garlic in the butter/oil, then added the salmon (seasoned with salt, pepper, and fresh lemon juice). I also used fresh baby dill instead of cilantro and didn't use as much as the recipe called for, maybe 1/2 cup. The dill gave it a nice, mellow flavor. The salmon came out flaky and light, and none of the flavors were overwhelming. We will definitely be having this again!

Let me just add that we had two pieces of fish (about 4-5 oz each). If I were to do this for four pieces, I'd definitely double the sauce; it was just enough for two pieces in the proportions listed.

I omitted the tomatoes and didn't bother with the couscous because we didn't have any. Let me be the first to say that this recipe is very tasty! The lemon pepper gives it a nice herby flavor with some zip. Thanks for sharing!

Easy fast delicious recipe. No cous cous. The left over sauce is delicious over mash potatoes.

We just made this again, using sea scallops instead of Salmon.  I use petite diced tomatoes (canned) instead of fresh, which allows for more juice.  I leave out the water.  Also, I leave out the cilantro because I don't like it.  I really believe the couscous is such a great addition.  We used the 5-minute Hodgkin Mills kind and it worked fine.  The only problem is we eat it too fast!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

I thought this recipe was really great. Instead of using fresh tomatoe, I used canned stewed tomatoes and I took out the salt since the Lemon-Pepper sesoning already had some. I also added a sliced  yellow onion. I served on top of rice. Very easy to make and this will make a BIG hit for dinner guest.I will definatley be using this recipe again. Yum, yum, yum!!!!!

This was so simple to cook, and very good.  There wasn't much sauce for me to use in the end.  And I added some cayenne pepper for a little spice.

I enjoyed this recipe.  It was really quick and simple.  It was my first time cooking fish, and this was an easy and delicious introduction.

I cooked rice instead of cous cous and served with sauteed spinach.  I did remove the seeds before chopping my tomatoes.  Next time, I will probably use a cup and a half of tomatoes.  They were really good!

That was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!!  We just finished eating it for dinner, and I had to come rate it!  It was so, so, so flavorful!  And I barely changed anything. The only thing I changed was I put the minced garlic in at the beginning with the oil and butter. I also added fresh mushrooms in with the tomatoes. SOOOOOOOO yummy! Thanks for the recipe! I will be making it again as soon as possible!

This is a great recipe! The cilantro adds a great flavor. It is very spicy. I think I will cut back on the lemon-pepper quite a bit but I will definitely be making this again!

yum! I omitted the cilantro since I am one of those people who thinks it tastes like soap. I also only used two filets but used the original amounts of everything else and still wished I had had more sauce in the end.

This was so simple and it really hit the spot. I used half of the oil and butter, also. This is going to be one of our regular salmon dishes from now on.

This was really good. It was very quick to prepare - and took a total of 20 minutes including cooking time. Extremely tasty for such little time and effort to prepare.

Fabulous! My hubby & I usually go for the sweet salmon recipes (brown sugar, coconut/pineapple, etc) but this was great! Will make again! (...good with just store bought couscous-tomato & lentil or pine nut by Near East are great!)

So tasty! I listened to one of the reviews and used real lemon juice and pepper instead of the Mrs. Dash stuff. I also used dill instead of cilantro (hubby hates it) and it tasted wonderful. Fish was so flaky and flavorful. Kids even loved it.

My husband and I loved this dish. Of course, I always add my touch (mostly because I don't have all the ingredients!), but it was really great. I used fresh lemon zest and freshly ground pepper instead of the lemon-pepper, and I didn't add the water as my fresh tomatoes had plenty. I also served it with rice which was flavoured with broth.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe! I used fresh lemon instead of lemon pepper, and just added regular black pepper. I, also, used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh because I was out of fresh, and it tasted awesome! I didn't have any fresh cilantro either so I used Marjoram, which was a great addition. Definitely will be using this recipe again!

This is probably the best salmon dish on this site--or anywhere! This was easy and quick to make, and the results were so tasty! I recalculated the recipe for two, used white wine instead of water, used sea salt, added a bit of thyme, and cooked for a little over ten minutes.  Served it over Israeli couscous, but next time may use "regular" couscous--AND make a larger amount of couscous.  My husband was very pleased, as was I, and I look forward to using this recipe again and seeing if it comes out just as good!

I love this recipe! I tried it over 4 years ago and it quickly became a family favorite. I omitted the couscous and used long grain wild rice (had it un the cupboards), added some shrimp and a side of pinto beans  and it was positively amazing! A side of steamed broccoli or asparagus and its just awesome. My mom won't stop asking for it :-)

I loved this! And will def. make it again. I used 2.5lbs of Salmon and I sprinkled, heavily, black pepper over the fish and then I used 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice instead of lemon pepper and it came out just fine! Very tasty and very simply and quick. I served with GMO free wild brown rice instead of cousous.

What a wonderful combination of flavors!  The tomatoes, cilantro and lemon pepper all go together great.  It may seem like a lot of cilantro, but it's really not overpowering at all.  Instead of the salt, the 1/4 cup water and the fresh tomatoes, I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, undrained.  I also skipped the butter.  It made the perfect amount of sauce for the (whole grain) couscous to soak up.  I gave this recipe 5 stars because it's easy to make, healthy and very tasty!

Delicious!  This is one of my favorite fish recipes to make at home now.  It even tasted great w/o the lemon pepper (I forgot I did not have any!).

Just okay for us. We used lemon pepper but still longed for a more acidic taste.

Let me start by saying – I DO NOT like salmon…but it’s really good for you and I am trying to eat better so I decided that I would need to choke some down for the good of my health.  I found this recipe to try and make it palatable…I believe the result was the best tasting dish I have had this year…possibly ever…it was THAT good…I SWEAR!   Had to share it with salmon lovers and salmon haters alike…it is DELICIOUS…

Of course I made some changes…I love garlic and the original recipe did not use much garlic – I added quite a bit (3 crushed cloves on my one piece of salmon), also after making it – I think if you’d like to be even more heart healthy you can omit the butter – it was unnecessary, the EVOO was plenty.  And I used more tomatoes and cilantro – I think this is key…the flavors were outstanding and there was enough that it made sort of a salsa side dish…SOOOO GOOD!!!  Don’t ask me why the recipe is called “Lemon Pepper Salmon” – although there is lemon pepper in it, the main flavors are the tomato, garlic, and cilantro; I would call it Italian Deliciousness Salmon.  PLEASE try it!  It is SO GOOD!  Super fast and one pan.  I didn’t try the couscous thing…

just staring to cook and my first fish dish!! a great way to begin. added a few chilli flakes  and before placing the salmon on the skillet, added  some chopped onions. while i did not have lemon pepper,squeezed a dash of fresh lime on . dishh turned out great, but was told that may have been even better with some more garlic and salt.

We have this recipe almost once a week served over rice. It's great! Super easy to make, I only add some "fish seasoning" to the salmon, with the other toppings. I love LOTS of flavor! :)

Fantastic - made as directed without the cousous. I did add just a splash of lemon juice and a handfull of semi-frozen shrimp towards the end of the cooking time.

VERY good. I've never cooked salmon before (Except the kind out of the can) so I was looking for something lemony and delicious. I skipped the couscous and served over brown rice instead.

Very simple to make (healthier if you don't use butter, use something lower in fat) and the tomatoes and cilantro just flavor it so well.  VERY easy, my husband said it was the best salmon he has ever eaten.  Couscous was great with it, but rice could work too.  Will make again!!!

Very delicious! Marinated salmon with garlic, pepper, salt and lime juice (didn't have lemon pepper) and then followed the rest of the recipe. Very flavorful and the salmon was very tender. Will be make this regularly for sure!

Added 1/2 cup of oil packed sun-dried tomatoes.  This was amazing.  I skipped the couscous for mashed potatoes, but it probably would have been better with a rice pilaf.

Loved it, loved it, loved it!  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used lemon zest instead.  I also substituted canned tomotoes for fresh. I didn't prepare the couscous--not my preferred grain, but everyone in our family loved the recipe.  Great flavors, simple and nutrition. I'm preparing it again tonight. YUM.

this was really good, and i'm not usually a salmon fan. i didn't have any cilantro so i substituted dried parsley. also, instead of the 2 tbsp of oil, i sprayed the pan with olive oil spray for a second or two. there's plenty of fat in this dish between the oil, salmon, and butter!

This was awesome!  We too are always in search of good salmon recipes because we eat it so frequently.  Our kids loved it and everyone had seconds.  Based on another recommendation, I used half of the required amount of butter and oil and used white wine instead of water, and cut a handful of grape tomatoes in half.  Simply delicious!

I am always looking for new salmon recipes because our family eats it at least twice a month and are tired of the typical teriyaki/honey and lemon dill recipes.  This was equisite.  Here is what I did differently:
I used less butter and oil--totally not neccessary to have all the extra fat, I used fresh lemon, fresh ground pepper and sea salt.  I used fresh grape tomatoes and white wine instead of water.  I also made Israeli couscous (the larger kind) with vegetable stock instead of water.  This is delicious with Tilapia also.

Been looking for a stovetop salmon recipe for a long time.  The flavor is just right with some extra garlic and a bit of thyme.  This has a lot of potential for addons.

Highly recommend this with couscous! I usually cut the fat in half to make a ~2 serving size of salmon. Watch the ingredients in your lemon pepper, as many have salt as the main ingredient. Use lemon juice and pepper if that's the case. I use chicken stock instead of water for both the couscous and salmon, it doesn't seem to alter the taste of the salmon (as in make anything chicken-y). And I usually throw in some fresh spinach with the cilantro for some added veggies.

Made as written, we thought this recipe was good.  I would probably make it again...but I also like to try other recipes as well.  I think other recipes for salmon on this site are equally as good as this one.

This was absolutely delicious. I only used 2 fish fillets but made no other changes to the recipe. The flavors were so good and it was easy to put together quickly. Although I'm considering trying a couple of minor changes the next time, this recipe is fantastic as is. If I made it with 4 fish fillets, I would double the other ingredients except couscous because I had some couscous to spare.

I was looking for something different & this recipe caught my eye.  It was perfect. I didn't have cilantro so I used diced onion. It smelled like scampi so I also added a splash of white wine. Didn't have cous cous so I used pineapple rice & made sure to ladle the pan sauce over it. I will have to try it with the cilantro.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly (I did use more garlic because we love it).  This meal went great with chardona wine.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Will be making this again and again.

Great recipe. I was out of lemon pepper so I squeezed the juice of one lemon after browning the flesh of the salmon and sprinkled generously with pepper. I had dill on hand that needed to be used, so changed out the cilantro for dill. Mmm Mmm Good! My kids couldn’t eat enough of it

Very tasty way to prep this dish. I followed the recipe and cooking instructions this first time, and just a heads up, this is how to prepare salmon if you like yours more well done. As I prefer a more medium/medium-rare salmon, next time I will reduce the amount of time it simmers in the pan. But overall, very flavorful!

So great! My husband approved! I did leave out tomatoes and cilantro. I know that would've made it even better but had none. The Couscous was really the right grain. Yummo!

I don't cook fish very often, because it's expensive and I don't want to ruin it. But this was easy and amazing. Fool proof. I followed the recipe exactly. Leave the skin on, that's where the omega 3 is. And my husband hates couscous, but loved it with this.

My 5 year old "very picky eater" asked for seconds and wanted to take it to school for lunch the next day. Even my toddler finished hers. That's a win-win dinner for us! Substitutions: I used parsley because I had no cilantro, Garlic paste since I had no fresh garlic, 1 tbs of butter instead of two. I will be making this again.

This is a keeper: Delicious, Fast & Easy
I did one small thing differently; after bringing the salmon to a robust simmer,  I covered the pan tightly cooked for another few minutes then shut the gas, keeping the cover on tight letting the fish finish cook through on its own.

This is my current favorite recipe for Salmon. The only changes I make is to significantly reduce the lemon pepper, and I squeeze fresh lemon on the fillets. I also halve the oil and butter. In the final 3 minutes, I add a couple cups of raw broccoli for a one pot meal.

This turned out great the first time and is definitely added to the permanent recipe collection for my family. 
I added capers, cumin, salt and pepper to the couscous. 
I always find "over medium heat" a bit vague but I adjusted to where the liquid stayed at a light simmer for the suggested time and it was just right.

This recipe is great and has a lot of potential. My only complaint is the amount of salt in the recipe. It was FAR too much! I will definitely make again but will use probably use about a third of the salt this recipe calls for. Otherwise, easy and delicious to make! Served ours with asparagus too.

I made it with only two pieces of salmon and found it very easy and delicious!!  My opinion, do make it with the couscous because the combination of the sauce and the couscous is superb!  Awesome recipe, I will make it again and again!!

Awesome recipe.   It was surprising how well the seasonings permeated the salmon; no tartar sauce necessary.  I didn't have fresh cilantro, but parsley was fine and I substituted chardonnay for the water.  This will be my "go to" poached salmon recipe.

My son hates any kind of fish. I had him taste a tiny piece and he loved it! I loved it and my husband loved it too! Thanks for sharing this recipe. This one is a keeper! Served it with steamed broccoli sautéed in garlic butter. YUM!

Not bad at all. Made it with salmon fillets instead of steaks. Make sure to check the ingredients on your package of lemon pepper... if it includes salts you'll want to significantly reduce or omit the salt from the recipe.

My username is scorch.  The name says everything about my cooking abilities:).  I am a novice cook and I tried this recipe.  I cooked for 7 people including me wife. My wife is an expert cook and amazingly she liked the way I prepared this recipe.  I changed the recipe slightly.  I only added 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro from my garden, due to availability, and I used 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion. I took the advice of another user and added diced canned tomatoes and it worked out very well.  This went over good with the group and my kids asked for seconds.  Because of that I give it five stars!

Great recipe--I made a few changes out of necessity.  I added about two capfuls of lemon juice (didn't have lemon pepper), and fresh ground black pepper.  Also, I used a little hickory-smoked sea salt in with the butter and olive oil since my butter was unsalted, and the hickory smoked salt on top as well.

This was really really good. I squeezed a lemon wedge over each filet before serving. We enjoyed the flavor of the sauce and the fish turned out nice and moist. I'm not a fan of couscous at all and while the sauce had excellent flavor it still didn't make the love the couscous so if you don't like it replace it with pasta or potatoes because the sauce still won't change your mind.

Made a serving for two and ended up using a whole cut tomato. If would have added anything; it would have been fresh squeezed lemon juice over the salmon, a touch of brown sugar, and another table spoon of butter. (organic smart balance) So more glaze would have been left in the skillet to top the salmon  with. I added greens- broccoli florets & asparagus which added to the taste of the dish.

This was delicious! I'm amazed at how a few simple ingredients could combine to such a tasty dish. I used freeze dried cilantro and it worked out well. I also substituted angel hair pasta for couscous instead as I prefer this particular type of pasta to go with simple oil-based sauces (honestly I considered using quinoa instead but felt it would be a little weird because the sauce is really like a pasta sauce). Otherwise I made it exactly as described, and it was ready in 30 minutes as stated in recipe. So easy, yummy and quick!

Everyone needs to try this recipe - this is honestly the best salmon I've ever had. It's restaurant quality, incredibly flavorful and quick! I make this recipe about once a month, and I always add extra tomatoes and serve spinach on the side. I also often use fillets instead of steaks - less bones and just as delicious.

My favorite salmon recipe so far! I omitted the butter to decrease the fat. The first time I made it I found it too salty, but the second time I left out the salt and it was perfect! I think salmon is salty enough on its own.

This was really quick, easy and delicious.  I had defrosted some Whitefish and looked in my recipe box to see what I could "adapt."  I happened to have fresh cilantro in the refrigerator, so this sounded like a good match.  I imagine if you don't have cilantro, fresh parsley or basil could be used instead.  Next time, I'm going to try adding 1/4 cup of wine instead of the water.  This recipe is so versatile.  You could probably use if for any type of fish - even shrimp or scallops.  And I'm glad you suggested couscous.  It got me out of the rice rut.  I will definitely try this one again.

I didn't really like this at all. I didn't like having my salmon sit in the buttery sauce, I didn't think the lemon-pepper would be so hot, and it just doesn't make me feel good.

I really liked this recipe.  Like most I doubled the water and the garlic to increase the flavor.  I am not a salmon eater but I loved it and will cook it again.  You could probably cut some of the butter or oil to reduce the fat.  I served it with rice.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe!  I LOVE salmon & always order it when dining at fine restaurants.  I have to say, this is salmon is the quality of a 5 star restaurant!  I am VERY picky about my salmon. I LOVED the flavor & the salmon was so moist.  Check it at around 8 minutes to make sure it doesn't get overdone....you want it moist & the cooking time always depends on how thick the salmon is.  I used fresh Sockeye Salmon, 3 T. each of butter & olive oil, and 2 tsp. garlic, increased water to 1/2 cup.  Used fresh lemon, salt, & pepper to taste.  The cilantro & tomato really add great flavor to this!  I served this with couscous & Maple Dill Carrots from this site.  Fresh green beans would go nicely with this as well.

I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY; I MADE A FEW CHANGES. I SAUTEED SOME ONIONS AND GARLIC IN THE SKILLET THEN I ADDED THE SALMON, AND FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THERE. I SERVED IT WITH COWBOY MASH POTATO...YUMMY

This was wonderful! I did add some sliced green onions. The only change I would make is to add the cilantro and tomatoes ten minutes into cooking the fish, to keep them from overcooking. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent! I took some other reviewers' advice and doubled the sauce, even though there were two of us. SOOO YUMMY!

Excellent recipe! Fast, easy and healthy too! I made it with yellow rice because I didn't have coucous and it turned out great. I think I'll leave out the salt though because it was quite salty. This one's a keeper for me....thanks!

I made this last night for Valentine's Day and we LOVED it! I omitted the cilantro (bc I don't like it), and it was still very flavorful. Next time, I might increase the liquid and the tomatoes, because there wasn't quite enough sauce to flavor couscous for all 4 pieces of fish. 
Definitely going to make this one again! THANK YOU!

This recipe is amazing.  I served it with brown rice instead of couscous.  I used olive oil and no butter, but those are the only changes I made.  The salmon was full of flavor.  My mom doesn't like salmon, but she loved this dish!  I highly recommend it!

Thank you to all who enjoyed it.

I Want to add that when I don't have fresh tomatoes, I use a 16ounce can of diced tomatoes.  The amount of water can be changed (up to 1 cup) depending on how much sauce you want to have. The whole thing is suppossed to be simmered together.  Salmon is delicate and high heat will ruin the fish.

Delicious, satisfied the salmon-lovers in my family and made it palatable to those who don't enjoy salmon usually!

With the measurements given, this recipe did not turn out well at all. It needs more like 3/4 cup or even a cup of water for the sauce! I have never charred food before, and I left the stovetop for about 2 minutes to change a load of laundry, came back upstairs and the tomatoes were a burnt mess in the bottom of the pan. Keep in mind that when I left the stove it had only been cooking for about 5 minutes. The salmon itself was not incredibly flavourful, but I think with more water this recipe would have turned out very well. Just needed that one adjustment.
