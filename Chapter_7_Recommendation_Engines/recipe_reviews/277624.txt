Yummy basic recipe but I d recommend a few changes next time for my taste. First I think it needs more than 2 tablespoons of liquid for the slurry (at least 1/4 cup) then I d add some garlic powder salt and pepper to the gravy.

I didn't have pork chops so I cut two pork steaks in half. I also use 3TBS of cornstarch instead of the flour and added it to 1/4c of broth. Skipped the seasoned salt and used salt and pepper and also added it to the gravy. Put in a few cloves of garlic and about a teaspoon of Thyme. Served it with rice and steamed broccoli for a balanced meal. Will probably try this with cubed steak or stew meat and use beef broth instead of chicken. 5 stars as is!

It's a great dish for those who are 'paranoid' about using canned soups in a recipe (once in a while). I make a very similar pork chop dish of my great grandmother's but it's made with a can of Cream of Mushroom soup.

Very good I would make some changes also... the flour to liquid ratio is a off it did not make a "slurry" I would just add a small amount of flour to the pan after taking the pork chops out and then bring to a boil. The rest seem to work great. served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Yumm!!

I made it according to the recipe but I used onion soup mix instead of the chicken broth it was awsome
