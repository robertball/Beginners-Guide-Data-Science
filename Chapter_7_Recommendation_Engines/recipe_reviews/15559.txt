This recipe was excellent. However, I did follow other's advice.  I added 1 can tomatoes w/chiles, 1 can of corn, 1 can of beans, 2tsp cumin, 2 tsp tumeric, splash of lime, chicken broth.  This will definitely be added to my menu.

For a low fat recipe, I think this is great.  it does need a little "spicing up," but nothing major.  After adding the black beans, I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp paprika, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I make this recipe at least every other week.  A great way to get a lot of fiber and protein without a lot of fat and carbs.

Great recipe!  The only addition I made was some diced tomatos and extra garlic.  Great tortilla filling! Even my meat-eater hubby loved it!

This was delicious!  Instead of vegetable broth I used a can of chicken broth.  Also doubled the garlic and added a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes with juice and a small can of corn, drained.  The cumin and cayenne pepper went together well.  Not bland at all with the extra additions.

Good recipe!!  I didn't have enough beans, so I used 1 1/2 cups frozen corn to make up the difference.  Also, I added a bunch of whole green olives with pimientos and I highly recommend that!!  And, I added lots of lemon juice, more cayenne, and more cumin.... I actually added too much cayenne but today it had toned down a bit and the flavors had melded so it was even better!  I think this would only be 3 stars without the adjustments, and what made it into five stars is that it tastes FABULOUS with cottage cheese!  I don't mean that you should mix it in with the beans and rice, just put some on your plate and then get a bit of cottage cheese on your fork along with the beans and rice for each bite.  I think the cottage cheese tastes so great with it because of the difference between hot and cold and spicy and mild.  Definitely try the cottage cheese! :o)

Very good!  We really enjoyed this with our Carnitas.  I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth,and added chopped fresh tomato and minced fresh jalapeno in with the beans. Pleasantly seasoned, subtle flavor, and just perfect as a side dish to Mexican entrees.

I am rating the recipe as written 4-stars - but with a few minor changes it quickly becomes a 5-star recipe!  I made the following changes: 1 tsp granulated garlic instead of 2 cloves (non in the house), chicken broth instead of veggie, 2 tsp cumin, only 1 can of black beans, plus added 1 can of corn (drained) and 1 can of Rotel tomatoes (undrained).  My husband loved it and has asked that it be added to our menu on a regular basis.  We used it as a burrito filling, a quesadilla filling, and a stand-alone dish.  I also added extra chicken broth to some of the leftovers and made it into soup.  The mixture would also be good on top of nachos or combined with chicken and cheese to make a casserole.  Cheese and/or sour cream are good compliments.  Next time, I will lower the cayenne to 1/8 tsp (the Rotel adds enough heat for my taste) and use 2 cans of beans (black, pinto, and kidney would all work well in this dish).

This recipe was VERY disappointing!  I ended up adding an extra cup of broth because the rice wasn't finished cooking yet. My husband and I love spices, and this was extremely bland, despite the fact that I added about three times the amount of spices to it. 

The only way I'll make this recipe again is if I'm in a hurry and have nothing else to make!

Very easy, tasty recipe.  Careful, though, if you are not a fan of spicy food, this dish can be too hot.  Although my boyfriend liked it, next time I will cut the pepper by half.

Tomorrow is payday and I literally had just the right ingredients for only this recipe. I wasn't expecting much, but OMG! This is a cheap, healthy and very yummy recipe that I will definitely make again. Thank you for feeding a poor pregnant woman!

Pretty good! We made this as a main dish (a lunch). It was tasty. 
I would definately make this again and maybe add tomatoes or green peppers.

As is, it's OK. It's very simple, easy, & fast to make. However, after trying it "as is", I made my own modifications later on so it can have more flavor. I ADD 1 DICED TOMATO, 1 SERRANO CHILE or JALAPENO (sometimes, 2) while I saute the onion & garlic. After I add the rice, I pour in 1 CAN of CHICKEN BROTH, along with a 1 1/2 TSP of CHICKEN BOUILLON. I mix in 3 cups of beans(NOT canned!), I've used black beans & pinto beans, but black beans DEFINITELY taste better for this recipe.   After adding the beans, I add the spices (cumin, cayenne, paprika, garlic powder, chili powder). I gave it more of 3 1/2 stars because I think you can make this recipe great by making just a FEW changes. This recipe isn't horrible, so I won't take away a star.

We really liked this.  Nice side dish with pretty good flavor.  Other than adding some frozen corn as others suggested, I followed the recipe as it was written, and we liked it.  Will make again.

This is a fantastic recipe! The only additions that I have made is adding 1 cup of thawed, frozen yellow corn and a can of petite diced tomatoes (drained) for additional color.  It works great in taco salad, burritos, or with tortilla chips. Love it!

Just reading this recipe, I knew it would need some adjusting, in part because I always cook with brown rice.  My cook time was around 40 min on the rice.  I used 1/2 the beans v-- 1 can black beans + 3/4 c. rice brought the proportions relatively even.  Also used 1 Tbsp oil rather than 1 tsp & added a little lime juice toward the end.  The spice level was OK for my 2 year-old and 8 month old twins.  If you like spicy foods, I recommend additional cayenne.  The 2nd time making, added diced tomatoes, a bay leaf, & included both red & black beans, which was more well-received than the original recipe.

I have made this several times. I add 1/4 tsp of turmeric and I get a delicious yellow color. I use half the beans and serve this as a side dish. I rinse the rice until the water is clear, that way I get perfect fluffy rice every time, just like my favorite mexican restaurant.

I had to come up with a vegen meal for a friend who was visitng and found this-I added diced red and green peppers, celery, finely minced onion, chili powder, less cumin, no cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and a tsp. of fresh lime juice. Served with low fat whole wheat tortillas, salsa, sliced lime, lettuce and tomatoes. It was a hit. We now like it so much we make it often but eat on tortillas with lowfat cheddar cheese and low fat sour cream added-still very healthy and rice and beans are a cheap nutritios meal!

I loved this but like everyone else I tweeked it! Used chicken broth instead of vege, used chili powder instead of cayenne, added 1 cup of crushed tomatoes, small can of green chilis, half a can of corn, and 3 shakes of tabasco! And it turned this recipe up on its head! Oh ya and I simmer cooked it on low(1) setting for 30 minutes more than recipe called for to let all ingredients merge!

I was really surprised how good this is.  AFter reading comments I thought it was going to be bland but it isn't.    The spices are perfect for the dish.  I do agree one way to change it would be to add canned tomatoes, fresh cilantro and diced avocado.  I only give it 4 stars because I save all my 5 star ratings for other-the-top-good.

What a wonderful recipe!  I often use brown rice instead of white to add a little more nutrition, and it tastes just fine that way.

It's easy, cheap, and makes a ton of food... but it's not something that I enjoyed eating.  It's certainly edible, but very bland.  If you notice all the high ratings, they added meat, different spices, veggies, etc....  as written 3 stars max!

As suggested by other reviewers i modified the recipe and it was delicious.
I used one red onion, a couple of gloves of garlic, one chopped up jalapeno and fried them in olive oil. Then added some plum tomatoes, parsley flakes, salt and cayenne. After cooking for a while i added a cup of basmati (long grain) rice and twice the amount of water and some lime juice and more salt.
I separately cooked some black beans and added them at to the rice when it was cooked. Tastes delish either plain or stuffed in tortillas with salsa and sour cream!

Fabulous! Easy to prepare, perfect amount of spice, and HEALTHY! 3.5 cups of beans is equal to two 15 oz cans. I only had one can of black beans, so I used a can of kidney beans as well.

I quadrupled this recipe and it still wasn’t enough!  My guests all thought it was wonderful, the addition of the cumin and cayenne was the perfect touch.  I used more onions and garlic than called for because we love them but it would have been good as written.

I added fresh cilantro, scallions, and a can of tomatoes with chilis. It had a nice spiciness to it, however, it still was a bit bland overall. Next time I will add a can of corn, a splash of lime juice, 2 tsp. turmeric, and 2 tsp. cumin, and maybe some seasoned salt.

The basic recipe was pretty good although like other reviewers said it does need some spicing up. I added a tablespoon of tumeric, a couple teaspoons, ground cumin and some seracha sauce.

Unfortunately my husband and I did not like this recipe. Overall it was very dry and just seemed to be missing something. Appears that most reviewers that enjoyed this, ended up adding and making tweaks.

This recipe has some really good ideas in it about how to perk up plain old rice and beans.  From now on, whenever I make anything like this, I'm going to boil the rice in stock and mix the beans in with the rice.  I took the suggestions of a few reviewers and fried up the spices with the onion and garlic, and at the end I added a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion with the beans.  I also used some black pepper, chili powder, oregano, and a bay leaf.  Next morning I wrapped up the leftovers in a tortilla with some cheese, salsa, and scrambled eggs for a yummy breakfast.

I made this today for dinner as a side with chicken. It is a keeper as written. I always follow the recipe as written before changing anything. However, I did add the cayenne pepper in stages to taste. This recipe makes more than enough to feed a family. Leftovers will be used in burritos tomorrow. We are cutting salt out of our diet so I used unsalted vegetable broth and no salt added black beans. Salt can be added at the table if wanted.

A nice recipe, although I did change it slightly based upon other reviews.  I used brown rice (obviously this increased the cooking time, and so I had to add more chicken stock as it cooked), and added a can of chopped tomatoes. I doubled the garlic, cumin and cayenne pepper, with some oregano. and added fresh cilantro right at the end. After re-reading the recipe I notice I only used one can of beans, but the results were great. I served this with corn tortillas with a little cheese and fresh tomatoes on the side and the results were awesome.  Very satisfying, and no missing the meat!  Thank you for sharing!

This was really good. Simple, and healthy, and yummy. I used brown rice since that's what I like, and was great. Would think it'd be great with some canned tomatoes too...

I followed the advice of the top commenter, less the tumeric because we didn't have any. This will be a new house staple. Cheap and delicious.

Awesome recipe. My mom thought it was those pre-made packages of rice because of all the flavour. I did add more garlic and used chicken broth. Is very good with sour cream on top.

Recipe is made healthier by (1) substituting brown rice for white rice and garlic Pam for olive oil and (2) eliminating broth.  I sauteed rice, onion, and garlic with garlic Pam and then cooked it according to instructions on rice box.  Then I sauteed black beans and spices for 4 min and topped cooked rice with it.  This whole grain no fat option is nutritional and very yummy!

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have the cayenne pepper or cumin so I added 1 can diced tomatoes with chilis and that was plenty hot!  I think I will add seasoning salt next time as my main seasoning.  I also added a can of corn and that was very good.  Check rice before 20 min to prevent soggy rice.

Was just not very impressed with this.  I really like spicy food but this just tasted like cayenne pepper...  There wasn't really much flavor besides that.  Will keep searching for an easy & good black beans and rice recipe

This is an easy side dish recipe.  I used less rice and less beans to make a small batch.  1/2 cup rice and one can of drained black beans.  Instead of cumin (I don't like cumin)  I used taco seasoning.  Great tasting and EASY.  Thanks

This recipe tasted really good, but I thought it turned out too dry, and I even added a little tomato juice. Maybe next time I'll try it without draining the beans? I put mayo on mine (as I do with red beans and rice)--an idea I got from my adoptive father who grew up in Louisiana. It's pretty yummy  :)

I'm rating this 5 starts because I want people to try it, but I did not in fact stick to the recipe. 

I added a can of Rotel, used chicken broth, added corn, and used just a sprinkle of cayenne. 

This is a fantastic basic recipe though, and I think would be hard to ruin as you experiment.

Eh - this was just ok. I added fresh tomatoes, corn and a ton of garlic salt. Wrapped it in fresh tortillas w chicken fajita meat. It made so much!  It wasnt terrible but I probably won't make it again.

This was good & even easier when I tried it in my new rice cooker! I added about a 1/2 cup each of fine chopped red & green peppers to the onions just because I had them & it looked nice too. Another time I had some salsa left over & tossed that in too.

Excellent--exactly what I was craving. No way it's 10 servings, though, as a main dish (what it's categorized as). We got about four out of it. I served it with corn  and everyone mixed it together anyway so maybe next time I'll just add it. We ate it wrapped in tortillas with salsa and a bit of cheese. It was delicious!

Wow!! We loved this rice...although I did change it a bit.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, I added a diced chipotle in adobo and about 1/4 cup of minced fresh parsley; I also added about a half a can of kernal corn to the final product and it was just delicious!!!  We will definitely make this again (it goes great with Mexican Chicken Kabobs from this site)

This recipe has become a staple in our house.  I use one (14 oz.) can of black beans, a lot more garlic, and a hefty squeeze of lime juice to add some sparkle.  We serve it with spicy sausage and it's a very satisfying meal.

Very good and very filling!  Instead of the 3-1/2 cups of black beans, I used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans.  I used chicken broth and threw in some chopped roasted red bell peppers while sauteing the onions. I served this in a tortilla with cheese and salsa.  Made a great lunch.

I Love this Recipe! I have made it 3 times so far and love it each time. It's a no fail recipe. You can add what you like. I use different beans, jalapenos, green and black olives and this time I will add a little chicken to it. My boys love it in tortillas with some cheese popped in the Microwave! Great protein too! Enjoy! A must in your recipe box!
Thanks for the recipe!

My husband's family is vegetarian, so I like to try meatless recipes. They just loved it, and although I usually need some kind of meat in my meal, I couldn't stop eating it. It has alot of flavor and is very filling. My only suggestion would be to try using brown rice instead of white. It takes longer for the rice to soften, but the flavor is much better in my opinion. Make alot of it because it will go fast.

Yummy. I also added a can a corn, a can of diced tomatoes, some lime juice and a little more cumin. I made Mrs Espy's enchilada sauce found on this site and used the whole sha-bang to make stuffed peppers. A wonderful veg*n meal! \m/

Perfect... I've been attempting to come up with an authentic Beans and Rice since returning from Belize, and this hits it right on the head. It's great alone or wrapped in a tortilla. You need to look no further for an outstanding representation of this carribean staple.

We enjoyed this but it was a lot of cumin!  I like cumin, but this was overpowering slightly.  Easy recipe, I think some chopped tomatoes added in at the end would have been a nice addition.

This recipe was very good however, I must say, I was worried it wouldn't be too flavorful so I jazzed it up a bit. I followed most of the recipe's components however as I sauteed the rice, I added a packet of Goya Saizon for some flavor. In addition, I mixed in a packet of Goya Chicken seasoning into the water when I added it. I chopped up four small tomatoes and added them with a bit of chopped green peppers that I had left over from my main which were fajitas. I wasn't sure if the beans and seasoning were suppose to be added after the rice was cooked or not so I just threw then in with the tomatoes. I only used one can of black beans however because I felt like 3 and 1/2 was a bit excessive. All and all, I must say, I was quite impressed! I usually buy the pre made rice mixes as they're easier but I didn't have any on hand and thus I created my own. Not sure how close this is to the original with all the changes but my husband and I thought this was outrageous! Will definetly make this again!

This recipe has become a staple in my house. As is, it makes a great side dish. It is also very versatile. I sometimes substitute red beans for black beans. My favorite variation is 15 oz black beans, 15 oz corn and 10 oz tomatoes and chili peppers instead of just black beans. I also add 1/4 tsp black pepper. I like to substitute chicken broth for the vegetable broth. Add some chicken strips (Fajita style) and wrap in a tortilla for a nice meal. I found that the garlic may brown too much when saute'd with the onion right away so I saute the onion 2 minutes, the garlic 2 minutes and then follow the recipe from there on. I found that a 3 quart saucepan is the perfect size for this recipe. Best of all, it re-heats great in the microwave so it makes for a quick meal the next day.

Loved this! Can be used as a main or side dish. I used the reviewers suggestions plus a couple of my own. Used chicken broth instead of veggie, 2 1/4 tsp cumin, 2 tsp tumeric, 1 tsp salt, can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with chilles, a tbsp of apple cider vinegar (gives a nice tang). 

It was SO flippin' good. I served it as a main course with whole wheat tortillas, shredded cheese, and corn as a veg side. Will make my variation again and again. Yum.

I docked it a star because the original recipe wasn't satisfactory, but it is so easily remedied with reviewers suggestions.

3 out of 5 of us liked it.  My 13 year old said she didn't like it but she couldn't stop eating it.  I liked it.  It was nice for a change.  I added sausage and peas to the mix to make it a fast one pan meal.  I will fix it again for a nice change.

This was good but pretty bland. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable & I used 4 cloves of garlic rather than 2. Also added a fresh chopped tomato to it. I will probably still make it, since its healthy & my 17 month old loved it, especially the black beans. A good healthy way to get some protein & fiber into him!! So overall it wasn't anything special but it was good enough to make again!

This is pretty good. I sauteed onion and garlic in a bit of veggie oil. I added one cup of rice, salt, pepper, cumin and lime zest and browned them a bit. I added 1/2 cup of mexican beer and 1.5 cups chicken broth. Once the rice was done I added a bag of frozen corn and one can of rinsed black beans. I wish I had a can of rotel to throw in there, but  hopefully the next time I make it, I will have it in the pantry to add to it. I plan to eat it over a bed of lettuce and maybe in some tortillas.

Excellent. I used ground chiles from the Mexican section of the grocery since they didn't have cayenne pepper.

I added a small bit of crushed red pepper, thyme, sage and dry parsley.

The grocery didn't have vegetable broth, so I used a reconstituted Knorr vegetable bullion.

I used red beans and black eyed peas.

Good as a tortilla stuffer with a little cheese and salsa, but kind of bland by itself.  I even added a can of rotel, some cilantro and some seasoning salt.  I also had to add more broth because the rice wasn't done and it was dry.

It is a good base recipe but it lacks any real heat or flavor. I added a can of rotel, used chicken broth, added extra cumin, cayenne, garlic, garlic salt and still added more salt. It took adding the garlic salt to figure out what was missing and that is when I just started adding the salt until it tasted right.

Only reason I didn't give this five stars is just because of the modifications I made to it.  I read several reviews and added a (drained) can of roasted dice tomatoes, chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, a can of corn (also drained) and smoked turkey sausage.  I cooked the garlic and onion for a few minutes, then added the sausage, then everything else, including the beans and rice.  Cooked it covered on low for about a half hour and it came out GREAT.  Did not change any of the seasonings, just added a tiny bit of salt.  Very good, filling, healthy, easy, and cheap!

It is nice and simple. I did, however, used the reviews and substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth. I added lots of cayenne pepper to spice it up. Great and simple addition to the main dish!

LOVED this recipe! So quick and easy! I did add a can of mild rotel (drained), and a can of fiesta corn (undrained), and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  It was delicious! I used the left overs as filling for a burrito with lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. YUM!  Will definitely be adding this to my "make-often" list.

This was so-so - I'm looking for more flavor in my beans and rice. I did add 1 lb cooked lean ground beef and used chicken broth instead of veg broth. Other then that, followed to a T. Wasn't bad, just wasn't great. Nice in a pinch, last min meal.

This was soooooo easy to make!  I added a few drained serving spoons of stewed diced tomatoes and used chicken broth.  Everyone EVEN THE UBER PICKY KIDS LIKED IT!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much!

Very cheap, healthy, AND good!  No 5 stars simply b/c I felt adding a few more ingredients made it better.  I added some corn, canned tomatoes, little lime, chili powder and some leftover shredded pork.  Very easy & quick recipe to use as a start and make your own adjustments.

I agree with other reviews, it was quite bland, I doubled the spices. Other than that, it was fantastic! I added corn and tomatoes and served the dish on tortilla, the family loved it!

It's okay.  I made it as is and it was pretty bland.  Tried doubling the cumin and it just tasted like cumin beans and rice.  Didn't have tumeric or lime on hand, but will try that along with chicken broth next time.  I think chicken broth will make it better.

This  was just okay for us.  I made as directed and wasn't that impressed so I added a tin of tomatoes.  It did lift the dish.  I also used kidney beans as that was what I had in my cupboard.  I had just the dish and my husband ate it with tortilla wraps.  Good dish when pushed for time and short on cash.

Awesomeness even though the servings listed are way off.  It says it feeds 10, but really only fed 5, and that WITH adding a can of garlic/onion diced tomatoes.  Increased recipe amounts and used what was on hand, which were kidneys/white beans instead of black beans, and chicken broth instead of vegetable.  Increased cayenne since we like extra spicy.  Great, great, great recipe!!

My college freshman daughter was home for the weekend and I made this for her because she loves it at school. It was simple, quick, and very tasty. I didn't change a thing and she ate it a couple of times and said it was better than what she gets at school.

I followed others advise and doubled the cumin (love cumin) and then added the tomatoes and corn. I also added some organic sausage that I had in the freezer. YUM!  I'm sure I will be making this again!

I added a few things to the recipe like bell peppers, corn, and jalapenos.  Then I served it with Salsa.  Excellent recipe for classic beans and rice.

Awesome.  I agree with other reviewers though...it needs some jazz.  I used a can of corn, can of beans, can of tomatoes, and just whatever spices I had laying around.    One thing I really liked was how easy this was.  I'm learning to cook and this was a really easy recipe that just goes to show that you don't need to know a ton to make a great dish.  The hardest part was dicing the onion....

This was delicious!  I didn't have the cumin so I left it out.  I used chicken stock as that is what I had.  I used 2 rinsed cans of 15oz black beans.  Used a dash (literally) of cayenne and I had some sliced scallions so I garnished at the end with those.  Everyone loved this and had 2nds and 3rds.  I made it with the Margarita Grilled Shrimp from this site.  I will be having burritos tomorrow for lunch with this filling  Excellent, excellent, excellent!  THANKS!

With a few additions this was a great recipe. I added some chopped green bell pepper which I sauteed with the onions and garlic (which I doubled). I also used half cup wild rice and half brown rice. I added a can of chopped jalapenos, and chopped tomatoes when I added the spices (including some garlic powder). A scoop of fat free cottage cheese on the side was a wonderful suggestion of another reviewer.

Very good,used 3/4 c. of  chicken stock and canned tomatoes undrained to cook the rice in, as suggested by another.   Added 1cup of frozen corn(didn't have any canned) when I added the beans. Served with burritos,   I ate it as a side dish with chedder on top, but the family put it inside the tortilla along with the meat. We'll have this again.

Very very good.  Next time I will scoop out the kids' servings before adding the spices.  Also, I put in some cut up kielbasa - that went well with the beans and rice.

Love it, love it, love it.  I plan to make this every week.  It's delicious, a perfect meal, and a great base for other things.  This is a true workhorse of a recipe.  It's cheap and comes together fast.  I would recommend heating everything up on medium, not medium high -- but all of you who aren't novice cooks, like I am, probably know how to do things.  : )

I loved this because it's so simple. You can add corn, green or red peppers, etc. You can use it as a burrito filling along with some cheese. One thing to note: it says 10 servings but that's if you're serving it as a side dish. As a main dish it serves only about two people.

This is sort of so-so. I'd give it a 3.5. It is definitely a quick lunch though! I think it needs salsa to liven it up a bit.

This recipe is ok, if you like the flavour of cumin - personally its not my favourite.  I ended up adding a can of diced tomatoes to adjust the consistency & flavour.

great recipe I've been vegetarian for years and never come across a bean and rice recipe this good. I added more cumin and chili powder and red pepper to give it more kick.--Been a few months since I rated this now I change alot I add a can of diced tomatoes and two handfuls of chopped fresh spinach(or 1 10oz pack frozen spinach thawed) I add cilantro if I have it a can of corn. The possiblities are endless. As far as I'm concerned if I can get my four kids 4yrs old and under to eat its worth five stars and then some.

Somewhat bland, yet tasty.  Definately needed other items to it like black olives, mushrooms, etc.  It is a good base start.

Overall this is a good recipe but I add more to it....tomatoes, etc.  I think its a good base to start with then add what *you* and your family like! I do make this quite often.

Very good! Perhaps a bit bland to be eaten as is. We ate it with chips and salsa.

This is not bad at all. It's a bit mushy but the flavour is excellent. i didn't add the Cumin because i think it smells like body odour.

I thought this turned out well as a side for enchiladas. I didn't measure the beans, but I used 2 cans that I drained and rinsed. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and added extra cumin. I thought this was fine as is but could see that adding corn and tomatoes would really spruce it up. It's a nice basic recipe that you could do more with.

I really enjoyed this dish, but what was more telling is that my family went back for seconds.  So, IMO - that takes this from 4 stars to 5.  I did very slight modifications, that don't really change the recipe but enhance it based on our tastes: I used low sodium chicken broth, added a can of rotel, and about a table spoon of diced pimentos.  Topped with reduced fat cheese and low fat sour cream, served next to a nice green salad... and YUMMY!

I had to add a tsp of cumin, 1 15oz can of tomatoes and 1 can of pinto beans. Used lemon juice but lime would have been better. Maybe, I'll add a red and green bell pepper next time.

Boring. Very average. Had to add spices. Made a tomato and coriander salad (with lemon juice) on the side and served with fried halloumi to make it actually taste of something.

Great recipe! And so easy to make. I use a little more olive oil to sauté but that's just my preference. I often double this recipe for larger get togethers. Leave or take out the cayenne to suit your families taste. I like to make this with the sweet cornbread recipe on this site. I know, strange, but MAN it is good.

I loved this!  I love this site.  It isn't about all the recipes it is about the reviews and being able to see what other people did to make it better for them and picking and choosing what you want to change so it is the best it can be the first time.  I sautéed the onions in the olive oil and a tablespoon of butter.  I added the garlic with the rice.  After the rice browned up some I added the spices (1 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder - no cayenne).  Then I used chicken broth, because I didn't have vegetable broth, brought it to a boil and simmered, covered for 25 minutes.  I drained a can of corn a can of black beans and semi drained a can of Rotel.  I added that to the cooked rice with about 1/2 teaspoon of lime juice.  Warmed everything through and viola!  Yumminess!

These were delicious!  They actually came out a little spicer than I was expecting the cumin and cayanne to make them.  I followed the recipe as is, and these made for a wonderful side. 

Make sure to check your rice, mine was a touch (just a touch) on the crunchy side.

I'm not just going to use this as a side though, this is going into my next taco or burrito night!

This recipe alone was a little bland for my tastes.  Then I followed the advice if some others and added a can of corn and a can of rotel.  It was delicious...especially paired with an avacado.

I tried it with 2 tsp of cumin, a can of tomatoes with chiles, 1 1/2 cups frozen corn, a can of beans, and chicken broth. It was great to me, but too spicy for the hubby (I think it was the chiles...). Next time I may cut back to the 1 tsp of cumin and try the chile powder and maybe some lime or cilantro. Great template recipe!

I added chopped jalapeno and twice as much garlic to the sauté, twice as much cumin, a small can of corn, diced fresh tomatoes and topped with diced avocado.  We loved it and will make it again often.

Yes, it's a good recipe. My boyfriend loves it and keeps eating it and I loved it, too.  I added a pinch of garlic and a pinch of paprika.  Also, I reduced h2o to a cup because I washed the white rice.  Yummy and healthy.

This was great!  I used two cans of "sensibly seasoned" black beans instead of plain, and it didn't need any extra spice at all. Very easy and will definitely be making this one again. It's a keeper.

If I could give this 3 and half stars, that would be ideal. :) This is a great starter recipe, but definitely needed a bit of tweaking. For me, it was too much cayenne, not nearly enough salt, and definitely needed more cumin. I doubled the cumin, used full salt chicken broth, flavored the broth with the cumin and cayenne to infuse the rice with the flavors. I saw someone suggest using lime, but I didn't have any. However I did have some Chili Lime rub, so I added that, yum! If I'd had cilantro and salsa, they would have been welcome additions. I made homemade tortillas to go with, and accidentally oversalted them, but it evened out with the slightly bland rice and beans.  It's definitely a great starter, but it needs your own flare.

This cannot be a diabetic recipe if it uses white rice which is known to strongly elevate blood sugar do to the body's response to turn the rice directly into sugar. If you really want to try this, use brown rice instead. If you don't believe me, check your blood glucose level after eating white rice.

This is a definite 5 star recipe after following other's recommendations that is. Chicken broth, 2 tsp cumin, 2tsp tumeric, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp salt, and along with the cayenne add 1 can tomatoes w/chilis. I also added some green onions just because we had them and it really added to the color and appearance. On it's own this recipe is ok just very bland

A simple and quick recipe. Low fat and healthy! I added more garlic and more onions. Adding the spices and seasoning while sauteing the onions builds more flavor. I put in a pinch of a salt and pepper. I also used low sodium chicken stock instead of the using vegetable stock.

We enjoyed this very much!  I only used 1 can of black beans but I also added a can of corn and a can of Tex Mex style Rotel. I also used yellow rice and doubled the spices. My 11 year old who usually hates rice gobbled this up!

Made this with a few adjustments, added extra garlic, used chicken broth instead and added turkey kielbasa (just because I had it) and it was great as a tortilla stuffer. With salsa and sour cream, loved it!

I made this for a church function and it turned out great!  I used other reviewers' suggestions and subbed chicken broth, added 1 can of Rotel tomatoes with jalepenos and lime, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can of white and yellow corn, and served chopped cilantro on the side.  It was delicious with just the right amount of spice (I don't care for anything hotter than medium hot and this was between mild and medium hot).  Enjoy!

This was so yummy. I made a few changes though... After I cooked the rice I added lime juice and zest, cilantro, and only 1 can of black beans. My hubby loved it too!

I made this last night and we loved it.  I did look at the comments of others and made some adjustments.  I used brown rice, Chicken stock, 1 can black beans, 1 1/2 cups thawed frozen white corn and added about 1/4 tsp adobo.  I chopped fresh tomato topped the rice with the tomato on our plates for some texture, temperature and color contrast.

I served this with the Slow Cooker Pernil Pork and the meal was a total hit!

For those who indicated their rice didn't cook:  No matter what a recipe says, you need to cook the rice following the directions on the package.  I used brown rice that cooks for 45 minutes per package.

Very tasty...and made enough to feed an army!  I omitted the cayenne and it was still flavorful and delicious.  Used homemade beef broth instead of the vegetable.  Made a great side, but was a phenomenal enchilada filler with some taco beef, fresh spinach, corn, and Mexican cheese blend.  Definitely a keeper!

The ingredients make a tasty dish but I think the cumin should be sauted with the rice instead of mixing in at the end as the spice needs some time to cook to release flavours. I used chicken broth as that was what I have on hand. Easy way to have black beans and rice.

Great base recipe, just needs some more flavor to make it five-star worthy. I added a can of rotel and that really helped. I also increased the cumin but that's a personal preference and I know some people don't like a lot of cumin.  One great thing about this dish is that it is so filling but still really healthy.  This will become a part of my dinner rotation for those nights when I don't have a lot of time. Thanks for sharing!

I made this with adding another heaping tsp of cayenne, 1 cup instant brown rice instead of the white rice, reduced the broth to 1 cup and cooked it for only 5 minutes. Then I added the beans and let the whole thing sit while we ate our salads. It was very moist and tasty! Way more than the two of us could eat at one meal. For the leftover, I will add a can of stewed tomatoes, a can of whole kernel corn drained, some more cumin and cayenne and some fresh lime juice. It will be filling enough to have as a main course.

Delicious! Loved this recipe:) It's easy and yummy! I didn't really change anything other than I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used chipotle chill instead and it was good. I'll definitely be using this recipe often.

After a few additions to this recipe it's a 5 for us.  I used 1 cup of brown jasmine rice and also added a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  It takes more like 45 minutes to cook, but worth the wait!  The spices quoted in the recipe we thought were perfect.  I too not only drained but rinsed the black beans.  We grilled some Johnsville brats and Bueno!

Very good, I would cut the cayenne pepper in half and/or possibly use freesh peppers instead.  Also, we added a can of corn and wrapped it in a flour tortilla.

Absolutely Amazing!! I've tried countless recipes from this website, but this is the first review I've ever made. I took the advice of other reviewers and this is what I came up with - for the broth I mixed liquid reserved from 1 can of "Original" Rotel diced chilies and tomatoes, 1 1/2 TBSP chicken bouillon and water up to the 1 1/2 C mark.    1 onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 can whole kernel corn, 1 can black beans, 1 tsp cumin, and the drained Rotel diced chilies and tomatoes. No need for cayenne. I topped it with grilled lemon pepper chicken slices and chopped cilantro. It looked like something you would see in a magazine and tasted   amazing.

I made it as recommended but thought it needed a kick and was relatively bland for my tastes.  I used brown rice but I doubt that had any affect.  I mixed it with another burrito recipe and like it much better as an add-in rather than as a stand-alonen dish.

I made this recipe as stated, except for one thing.  I added a chopped jalapeno with the onion and garlic.  I still thought it was pretty boring.  Not bad in a pinch, though.  So easy and quick.  Healthy too.  This is one of those meals that will probably be better the next day... I'm looking forward to it.

This was good the first time, leftovers were better.  I used the leftovers to make stuffed peppers.  I cooked the stuffed peppers at 350 degrees for 45 minutes with 1" water in the bottom of the baking dish.  Added cheese and cooked for 10 more minutes. Served with more cheese and salsa.  YUM!

That is all this recipe is. Black beans and rice. You really need to doctor this up to make it flavorful. Good as a side dish for tacos or even to put this on tortilla chips and top with cheese.

Excellent recipe.  I added a can of undrained Rotel with lime and cilantro and 1 minced jalapeno to spice it up.  I cut back on the broth by 1/2 cup to allow for the undrained Rotel.  Good hot or cold and a great enchilada filling with some grated pepperjack cheese.

Okay by far this is the best black beans and rice recipe. I followed my fellow reviewers and added 1 can of diced tomatoe and corn.I added 1 1/2 cups of rice and 1 3/4 of chicken stock and 3 thai chili's cut in half (optional).

The end result was wonderful but 2 stars because of all the additions I made. Omitted the onion and replaced it with a Tbsp of onion powder. Used chicken broth instead of vegetable. 2tsp of cumin, tsp of chili powder, dash of cayenne, 1/2tsp garlic salt. The bean to rice ratio was off for me. Next time I will use less beans. *Also used a can of diced tomatoes, drained.

This was just okay before I added to the dish. I added fresh diced jalapeño, chili powder and garlic powder. I also added more garlic. I baked this on 375 for about 45 minutes, covered. At the end I added Mexican cheese to the top. I served with chicken chipotle from AR. Tomorrow for lunch I'll add pico and diced avocado to the rice and beans.I think this would go well in a burrito or a burrito salad bowl. Yum,

I agree with the other posts.  It was bland.  I added tomato, sweet corn, several kinds of beans, and a variety of spices to add more dimension to the dish.  Adding fresh tomatos and corn was a huge improvement.  It is good hot or cold.  It is a great vegetarian dish, quick, easy, adjustable, etc... it can get too spicy, so watch out.

I found I needed to add more vegetable broth to cook the rice.  Also added 1/4 tsp. tumeric, garlic, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I also added sauteed chard when I added the beans.  Turned out great!

Easy, easy to make.  My neighbor stopped by at dinner time and enjoyed this meal with us.  She asked for the recipe when she left.  I did serve it with sour cream, cheese and chille verde sauce.  My 7 year-old even ate without being told to.

This was not as good as I was expecting.  I used chicken broth instead but kept everything else the same.  I'm not sure if I was supposed to drain the canned beans first but my rice dish was soggier than I would have liked.  I also added corn and a can of rotel for extra flavor but it was still kind of bland.  I don't think I'll make this dish again.

Followed the advice of many other reviewers and used 1 can corn, 1 can black beans and 1 can Ro-Tel (in place of the 3.5 C black beans).  The dish was good, but too spicy for my children.  I will use less cayenne pepper next time.

I chopped up some green onions, a yellow pepper along with the onion, and garlic.  I also took everyone else's advice and added some extra cayenne and cumin.  I didn't have any veggie stock, so I did use chicken stock.  With these few changes, this was a very good dish and I will make it again!

Really good!... added chopped red pepper and zucchini, used about 1-2 tablespoons taco seasoning instead of the cumin, increased the rice to 1 cup (and 1 cup broth), added a can of tomatoes and a can of corn, and put in in a cassarole dish and topped with shredded monterey jack cheese.  I thought it was really good with the extra veggies.

Great inexpensive healthy dish. We loved it. I made it with cooked dried black beans which nicely hold their shape. I also added chopped aspagus (just because I have lots of it) and I liked the combination.

This was a very good recipe. I added fresh spinach, tomatoes, extra garlic and used chicken broth. We put the beans and rice in tortillas with shredded cheese, avacado and sour cream. I plan on adding cilantro next time. Yummy!!!

This recipe is excellent.  I happened to have a can of green chilies on hand so I threw those in.  Other than that I made it as is.  But there is so much you could do with this as the base recipe.  Quick, easy, yummy and customizable.  Perfect! Thanks!!

I had the same problem as Ms. Scarlett, the reviewer below.  The rice didn't cook in 20 minutes, and soaked up the amount of broth specified.  I had to add at least twice as much broth and waited about 10 more minutes, and still the rice was a bit undercooked.

Delicious! I added some extra ingredients but followed the basic outline of the recipe and it came out really well. I added celery and a green bell pepper, along with some spicy peppers and quite a bit more cayenne, cumin and tumeric since I like things extra spicy. I also used brown rice since it was all I had on hand, and it was great. I added fresh cilantro as a garnish. Would have been great with lime juice too.

We loved this recipe! It may be Mediterranean in nature, but it tastes exactly like the beans and rice served at a local Mexican restaurant. My whole family raved about it, and we ate the leftovers in tortillas. My son put monterey jack cheese on his and said it was great. I will definitely make this again.

This is a family favorite: filling, but not fatty.  I do soak my beans, but add a little bacon drippings, onions and salt to them.  I rinse my rice before I cook it to make it sticky, too.  Serve with lettuce, tomatoes/salsa, corn, cheese and plain yogurt on top for that extra little something which makes it a complete and completely tasty meal!

the only thing different that I did was I used quinoa instead of white rice!  This was really good!  I also tried it with a little bit of sour cream that was good too

Seriously this was so easy and mighty tasty! The best black beans and rice recipes without all the fuss. I used union soup mix and water instead of broth for more flavor the 2nd time. both were fantastic. you should make this. ;)

This recipe, made as written, is really, really bland.  I followed some of the suggestions and added more cumin and a can of tomatoes, but even that left it really flavorless.  In the end I saved the meal by adding in about 1-2T of cumin, 1t chili powder, 2t paprika, 1t oregano, 1/2t thyme, and about 1t salt (a MUCH needed addition!).  We served this with a bit of sour cream and shredded pepper-jack cheese on top.  Over all, it was good with the changes I made, but I still think that I'll look elsewhere for a good bean and rice meal.

I like the simplicity of the recipe. It tasted good. However, I don't know if it was the problem with the recipe but I changed the servings by half. When I did this there was not enough veg. stock to cook the rice all the way through. I had to add more liquid to get the rice to cook. That was a little frustrating.

Delicious!  I added diced tomatoes with chilies. And of course upped the garlic and added a few other spices.

Good base.  I actually used the suggestion of the first reviewer and added a can of diced tomatoes w/ chiles, and a can of corn.  I also added a little cilantro. DH loved it!  It would make a good base for burritos

Very good. I browned an onion (no garlic) and added a tsp of chili powder to it. Then I used 1c rice, 2c water, 2tsp knorr chicken bouillon (the stuff in the big green canister) and 1Tbsp tomato paste (to the water). I let it all boil and simmered for 15 minutes. Then I added a can of black beans and I would have added a can of diced tomatoes but I was all out. I added a little oregano, cayenne, cumin and garlic powder. It was fantastic!

This is a simple recipe for those of us who are trying to cut back on meat/fat consumption.  I added a can of spicy ro-tel, a can of corn and 2 regular sized zucchini diced to make it a more hearty meal dish.  Sprinkled with some mozzerella and a dallop of low fat sour cream, and it was a delicious healthy dinner

Pretty darn good recipe!! Didn't have onicons (HOW did that happen??) so used dried shallots. Used chicken broth and added a little salt. Also threw in a 1/2 a chopped jalepeno and one can of drained black beans into the pot at the same time. My husband said it tasted better than our favorite Cuban restaurant. Definitely worth trying!

This was pretty good.  I won't drain all the liquid off my beans next time, as the dish wasn't quite "wet" enough in my opinion, and I will definitely season it up a bit more.

A little bland.  I didn't not add the cayenne pepper because of the kids but added a littleC salt and hot sauce to my plate of food to add more flavor.  Definitely can taste the cumin.

This was an easy and yummy recipe. I used chicken broth and brown rice instead of white (it takes longer to cook).  It is a good base recipe with room to make it your own.

This dish is great...with the modification suggested on here. Diced tomatoes, garlic salt, lemon and more spices.  Take the suggestion on here so you don't have a pan of plain black beans and rice.

This is a great vegetarian weeknight meal. I added a little more seasoning like cajun seasoning and black pepper. I also loved how easy it was to prepare. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be making this again very soon.

I really liked it,although my family thought it was too spicy.  I'll admit I doubled the garlic...it was good on whole wheat tortillas, but even better on a bed of blue corn chips.  Thank you for the recipe

Super bland rice and beans.  The only flavor I could taste is the cayenne pepper, and since I don't like very spicy dishes I will cut back on that if I make it again.  Edit-1/30/14.  I added a diced fresh tomato, one half cup corn and reduced cayenne to 1/8 tsp.  Much better to us this way!

This recipe is pretty good...although it needs a little help.  I added 1/2 teaspoon salt and served it in a burrito with fresh chopped tomatoes, cheddar cheese, black olives, salsa, and lettuce.  I also needed to cook the rice longer than 20 minutes...it was still crunchy.

This was a nice tasting dish.  I paired it with avocado quesadillas.  I followed previous reviewers' advice and added a can of Rotel that I had drained to the finished product which made this slightly spicy.  I found it to be pretty flavorful and if you like black beans and rice, you'll probably agree.  I used about 4 cloves of garlic and one medium onion.  I'll make this again as a side dish to my mexican dishes.  Thanks for posting.

I made some additions but left the bare bones of this recipe the same to make an exceptionally delicious dish!! After sauteeing the onion and rice with some cumin and chili powder I added the broth I also added a can of the spicy diced tomatoes and mild chilies. I cooked the rice as directed and when finished I added a can of rinsed, drained black beans and cooked veggie crumbles. The end result was so yummy it became my favorite dinner!!

When we sat down to eat this, both of us were expecting it to be healthy but not necessarily good and interesting to eat.  Boy were we wrong!  I added some fresh cilantro to the mix and the combination of cilantro and cumin was unbelievable.  We used this mixture as a filling for corn tortillas and sprinkled a little bit of cheese on top.  This will definitely become a staple recipe in our diets!

Very simple to make, and full of flavor.  Very similar to regional rice dishes we have here (Caribbean coast of Colombia), with a little more zing.  Definately will make this again.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly, but added fresh cilantro at the end.  I also kept the cover half way off the rice while cooking because I like my rice dry, not mushy.  I am going to double the recipe next time because it really didn't make enough for my 4 dinner guests.  We each got one small spoonfull.

This was the perfect thing for us!  I am vegetarian and my husband is not-I cooked sausages on the side for him and he ate it all mixed together.  I ate mine in corn tortillas with shredded cheese.  Both ways were delicious.  Even my super picky 3 yr old ate it without picking through it and asked for more (that alone is worth 5 stars!!).  Besides being tasty, it was very easy, fast and cheap-a keeper!!  I used one can of beans and added the spices in when I added the broth so they could cook into the rice.  Perfect and definitely going into the rotation!!

My husband refuses to eat black beans in general, but I got him to have second helpings of this. :)  I served the mixture inside warm corn taco shells with a little monterey jack cheese on top and some lettuce.  It was like vegetarian tacos, and very delicious.  The only change I made was that I only put in 1 can of black beans instead of 3.5 cups -- that just seemed like too much.

This was so tasty! My first time cooking a meal for my vegetarian self and it was great! My parents were making there own meal because they are not vegan and they thought what I was cooking smelled so good they tasted it and loved it! I used brown rice instead of white and added a lot more cumin and even some basil and oregano and it was great! A whole lot of flavor!

This is a really good recipe.  I topped it off with a dollop if chive sour cream.  It was delicious.  A little lime juice added would be excellent!

We made this twice - 1st my husband (who didn't read the recipe carefully) added the chicken broth to the beans, cooked the rice in plain water and left out the cumin but added bay leaves.  He spooned the bean mixture over the rice and it was EXCELLENT!  When I made it I followed the recipe as written cooking the rice in the broth, but I added a couple of bay leaves and left out the cumin and then mixed the beans in the cooked rice as directed.  It was good, but not as good as hubby's version, so I'm giving this 4 stars b/c the recipe as written was just OK.  However, will  make this again w/ hubby's alterations.  Also, we both used one 15 oz can of beans.

I also used chicken broth instead of veggie, and it turned out wonderful!!!  I was thinking that if I browned up some ground beef, it would be a complete meal!  Thank you!

Wonderful recipe! I can't believe it's good for me! I used instant brown rice and just cut the cooking time from 20 minutes to 5 minutes as per the rice box. Because I used instant rice the whole dish took me a grand total of 15 minutes to make including prep time! Health and simplicity - you've got to love that. 
This could be served in a warm flour tortilla with chopped tomatoes, a few chives, and a bit of light sour cream. Mmmm!

This has really become a fast family favorite. I have played with it to suit my family's taste better.  I replace the olive oil with chili oil, and add a little more garlic.  I also add any leftover meat that might be in the fridge and found beef pork chicken and turkey to be equally good in this.  I also double the recipe when I make this, because the kids love it as an after school snack. They just fill a corn tortilla, zap it in the microwave and top with some shredded pepper jack cheese.  Great recipe!

I found this recipe very bland. It seems to have pleased a lot of people, so I suppose if you're the type who likes very simple side dishes this might be okay. I usually serve beans and rice as a main dish, and expect it to have a lively, spicy flavour. This recipe did not - I had to add a lot of seasonsing to it to make it comparable to the beans and rice mixes you can buy at the grocery store.

This was ok - I tried one can of refried beans as someone else had suggested because I didn't have 2 cans of black beans. The refrieds made it thick like a dip (which was good with corn chips) and it made a fairly good filling for tortillas. Next time I'll make sure to have the 2 cans of black beans though. This was a good "clean out the cans cupboard" meal and was nice because it was filling yet meatless.

I can't figure why so many rated 4-5 stars. This was pretty plain; beans and rice with a little broth flavor.??  I made twice and added fresh cilantro, corn, cheese, some chopped tomatoes and some fresh squeezed lime;just before serving. Was much better.

This is a wonderful, easy, and versatile recipe. It is easy to suit to your own taste. I used brown rice and added extra water, so it took about 45 minutes to cook. I also added more cumin, some chopped jalepeno peppers, a red bell pepper, and a can of diced tomatos, and some fresh coriander. It was fantastic topped with shredded cheddar, and served with lowfat yogurt on the side. Very flavorful, filling, and healthy!

Delicious! I make this at least once a week. It is very satisfying and healthy to boot. My fiance is also crazy about this recipe. I add diced red bell pepper to mine as well as fresh cilantro. I roll it in a burrito with cheese and some hot sauce and I am in heaven. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I was shocked when my entire family loved this recipe. It was a nice flavouring. I added 1/4tsp if paprika and served more like a buffet where you can add your favourite toppings to the rice and beans. Great for a burrito bowl.

I substituted the broth with a can of tomato soup, and it worked out fine. I doubled the garlic. Instead of a stock pot on the stove, I used my electric pressure cooker. Started on Sauté High mode and then switched to Pressure Cooker Rice mode. I let it vent naturally and afterwards stirred in the beans and spices in Keep Warm mode. An easy, versatile recipe.

The recipe is a good one and the proportions are good but I think that the order of operations is why some people find it so bland.  This is how I think the instructions should read:

1. In the stock pot, heat the oil.  Set a timer for 4 minutes and dump the onions in.
2. At three minutes left, add the spices.  This activates the spices.
3. At two minutes left, add the rice.  I'm not at all sure that toasting rice before adding water does anything important but it seems to be the fad these days.
4. At one minute left, add the garlic.  This way the garlic doesn't get murdered by cooking over direct heat for so long.
5. When the timer goes off, turn the heat down to low and add the broth.  If the broth is still warm from the kettle, then it should boil instantly.  Just slam that lid down to hold the steam in.  Otherwise, bring up to a boil and then turn down to low and put the lid on.

Do the above and it should be pretty flavourful.

No cumin. Added garlic powder. 1 dash Worcestershire and Tabasco each, no cayenne.  Used only 1 can beans for me. Enough for 2-3 meals. Cooked rice separately.

First time making this recipe. Very easy and delicious. Even my picky granddaughter tried it and liked it! Doubling the recipe next time as a side dish with pan roasted veggies, Italian sausages and chicken thighs. One change was that I used chicken broth.

Looked for cheap meals for big families and this... OMG I loved it!!  I looked into the reviews and took from some of a couple recipes and made it mine. I have 10 ppl to feed, 8 of which are all opinionated teenagers! THEY LOVED IT! 
Heres what I did.

I added chicken which I sauted in the onion, garlic and olive oil.
To save time I used minute rice. 7 cups. Then Kroger chicken broth. 1 32 oz container and 1-14 oz can chicken broth. Then 1 can corn. 1 can red gold diced tomatoes garlic and onion. 4 cans of black beans. 

I put the chicken broth, 2 tsp paprika, 2 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp cayenne pepper "do 1 if you only wanna a tiny twang of heat, I dont do spicy and 2 was good for me" 
put the broth & seasoning together,  then add your rice to the broth. Then add beans. add the chicken with the sauted onions & garlic. add the corn and can of Tom onion and garlic. 

WAS AMAZING! When I was done warming everything together I got tortilla chips, shredded cheese & sour cream. SCORE FOR MOM!!

I made this recipe with leftover rice from a Chinese food meal a couple of days before. Probably would have tasted better with fresh rice. The cumin was a bit strong for my taste so I'll use a little less next time.

I made it and it was fantastic.  Easy to make and stores and serves next day just fine, maybe even better! Lots of protein so this one is great as an entre alone or as a slightly sophisticated side.

I've used it as a burrito stuffing with some country sausage and scramble egg.   Wrap it in a steamed flour tortilla.  Pop it up a bit by turning some spinach into the egg and sausage mixture just before you fold in the beans & rice.  Adding a little chopped cilantro (if you have it) is a great add.  By now the volume has nearly double so steam a few extra tortilla shells.

Tried the review to use 2 tsp cumin & tomato’s with chilies. Way too much cumin for my taste. Plus the cayenne pepper in the original recipe made it more spice than taste

I am not a rice and beans person. But decided to try it.  We cut the recipe in half as there are only two of us.  It was fantastic. My husband cooked it. Only change, plan on cooking rice longer. Served it with pork chops.  Going to cut the chop up into  bite size pieces, put in with rice and some more stock and cook leftovers tomorrow.

Sometimes less is more.  This is the recipe we've been looking for.  Wanted something similar to when you go to Chipotle and get beans and rice.  I hate all the tomato recipes out there... different style - that's Mexican red rice.  Only adjustments I made were a half a large onion (not whole - but maybe they meant whole small)... and 2 cups broth (vs. 1.5)... oh, and we topped with a little shredded Mexican or cheddar cheese.  Simply amazing!

I have made this twice now.  The 1st time I followed the recipe to a T.  It was ehh.  The second time I made it I added the spices to the broth while the rice was cooking.  I omitted the Cayenne pepper.  I added 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp chili powder.  It came out so much better!

This was delicious, once I made a few additions... Added one can of tomatoes, once can of corn, a touch more cumin than the recipe called for and a pinch of turmeric. I cooked it for slightly longer than the recipe called for, and once it was done, I topped it with jalapeño cheddar cheese and put the lid on so that it melted.

Absolutely wonderful. My husband who has a limited palette(I’m being kind) loved this dish. I’ll make it again. There is just the 2 of us so we had a lot left over. Turned it into casserole, added chicken a bit of mayo and some corn, added cheese to the top and baked for about 20 minuets.

I took the advice of others and added a can of chopped tomatoes with chili peppers as well as some chopped cilantro.  I added some of the cilantro while cooking and sprinkled on top when served.  With those additions I rate it a 5.

Made this last night alongside some tamales. My boyfriend tasted it and got two extra helpings! I was shocked because he is not a fan of rice in general. The only thing I did a little different was add a teaspoon of paprika. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have been making this for years. It's a good side to many Cuban dishes, such as Picadillo and Ropa Vieja.
I don't make any changes to the recipe. It's good the way it is. But make sure you rinse the beans or else they will tint the rice with a grayish color.
Helpful hint : 2 cans of black beans drained = 3 1/2 cups.

I was looking for more for guidance, and this recipe was a good start.  

I sautéed chopped onions, red and yellow peppers, celery and garlic.  Added cooked basmati rice, a can of black beans and a can of corn.  A little chicken stock, cumin, as well as a tsp of coriander and some thyme, lime juice and honey.  (I'm not a fan of cayenne powder and didn't want it too hot).

It was pretty bland as is, but very much improved with a can of diced tomatoes, green chile, and some chili power and paprika. Works great as enchilada filling.

Made a few times now.  A good recipe as is, but as others have stated add diced tomatoes, extra garlic, cumin and if you like it spicier add extra cayenne.  I also added chopped fresh cilantro and some green onions.  YUM!  Someone also said to add some green olives w/pimentos.  Perhaps next time.  Also they said to try it with a side of cottage cheese on your plate.  Seems salty but that is my weakness/nemesis.

This is a great basic recipe. I added yellow and red peppers as well as a couple of chili slices for zip. I seasoned the sautéed vegetables with thyme, garlic powder, and 2 tablespoons of cider vinegar. It smells fantastic! I served the rice with ribs.

I enjoyed this simple dish. Plenty of protien low in fat! I used only a pinch of Cayenne pepper as I don't like a lot of heat in my food. I used 2 cans of blk. beans.

Absolutely loved it.  This was my 1st time making rice and beans from scratch. I usually buy the Goya boxed kind. I didn't change anything but I did add about a cup and a half extra chicken broth while it was cooking. I also added some fresh cilantro at the end and served it with garlic and lemon sautéed shrimp. Even my 3 year old loved it.

Awesome!  I cut back on the Cayenne pepper, added some Adobo spice, 1 can of drained corn and 1 can "diced" tomatoes but I chopped these up before I added to the rice.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I made this recipe two nights ago...I did change it to the following:
Step 1 remained the same.  For step 2 I added chicken broth (slightly more than 1 1/2 cups), a can of whole kernel corn, a can of Rotel tomatoes (with green peppers) and two cans of black beans, one Ranch style and one plain.  Here's the weird thing...I added the suggested spices, but when I tasted it, it really lacked salt to me.  So I added salt to taste.  When it was all done it was hotter than hell!!  So next time I will omit the cayenne altogether...the heat from the Rotel is enough.  After a couple of days, the heat has dissipated and today (the 3rd day) it is absolute perfect.  Wonderful, delicious, inexpensive meal.  Yummy!

This is a great basic recipe!  My family likes spicy so I jazzed it up with some chipotle seasoning and a hot chili powder, but it's certainly not necessary.  Also, I had to add about 1/2 cup more broth (I used low sodium chicken) to keep it moist. All in all a great side dish! Thank you for posting it.

I made this for my vegetarian daughter and her husband to help out after they went home with their first baby last week.  I left out the cayenne pepper, as she isn't much for too hot, and I did add the can of corn, the can of diced tomatoes with chiles, and an extra can of black beans, all drained.  I did what several other have said and doubled the cumin and added 2 t. turmeric and 1 T. lime juice.  When I got home, I made the same thing for us using chicken broth and adding a scant 1/4 t. cayenne.  Every one of us loved it!  It was a bit on the hot side for me, but I still enjoyed it, and my husband, who loves hot food, found it perfect for his taste as well.  Adult kids fought over the leftovers!  Took more than the listed 5 minutes of prep, but still easy.  Husband said "definitely make this again!"

Very good recipe. I used less cayenne pepper than what was stated in the recipe because I don't enjoy overly spicy dishes. I also added other spices & ingredients that weren't mentioned in the recipe, such as undrained diced stewed tomatoes, small red beans, less black beans, chopped green onions and Tex-Mex seasoning.  I used brown rice instead of white & added more vegetable broth to the mix to allow for additional cooking time. This ended up being a very tasty dish that I will definitely make again.

The cumin was overpowering, and it needed something else.  I think I should have added the tomatoes or a cup of salsa maybe to try to add some more flavors to it.   (I followed it exactly).  Maybe green chilies, more garlic?

This recipe is perfect as written but so versatile.  I added white corn cut from the cob which added a wonderful crunch texture and a couple of fresh tomatoes diced for added color and flavor. I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth instead. Thanks for a tasty and healthy dish.

Five star only because it's a great starter recipe.  That said, it cries out for embellishments.  Think chopped cilantro, avocado based salsa and some sour cream served on the side.  A splash of lime here or there?  I haven't read the reviews, so hope I'm not being redundant.  Black beans and rice is one of those dishes you can't ruin. You can make it your own.  Just always use fresh ingredients.  I would be blown away if I got this at a tail-gate party before a Giants game!  All you need is tacos or tortillas, lots of beer,  And LUCK.

I don't like reviews where the recipe wasn't followed but I didn't have any of the spices. I used 2 tsp of taco seasoning instead of cumin and cayenne but I cooked it the same way. I will try some of the suggestions in the reviews and add more vegetables and additional seasoning next time.

This recipe ROCKS! The only changes that I made were: I added 1 can of Rotel, a small can of corn (drained). I substituted beef broth for vegetable broth, and added the amount of cayenne and cumin to 1/2 teaspoon each. Then since I can't cook rice to save myself, I cooked the rice in a rice cooker, and added it last.

This is one of my favorite dishes. It works as a great side dish for chicken or it can be the main course and you can pair it with a salad. I doubled all of the spices and added 1 TBS of Cajun seasoning too. Also, be sure to add a can of diced tomatoes at the very end.

I followed the recipe, except using dried beans instead of canned and brown rice instead of white. Very bland dry. I added fresh tomatoes to make it more moist. I put the leftovers in a soft tortilla shell with shredded cheese for quesidillas. Much better to eat that way.

cilantro.  Add grilled chicken and you've got a complete dish !

I thought it was great - just added more pepper, dash of oregano and a vegetable cube.  I used the water that the dried beans were soaked in.

Yet ANOTHER excellent, easy-to-make dish from this site, love it! I made this per the recipe, yet like other reviewers used chicken broth & added 1 can of fiesta corn, 1 can of zesty diced tomatoes, and 1-1/2 cans of black beans, chopped cilantro, and fresh lime juice from 2 small limes -- DELISH DISH!!!

I made this for the first time completely "as is" and doubled the recipe for my "taco bar" deck party. It was delicious. Very simple flavors while being very tasty! One party attendee said it was the best beans and rice she had ever had.

Loved this recipe!  It's a great base for a lot of Mexican dishes and makes a great meal in itself.  My husband and I are trying to go vegetarian and this will be a staple in our diet.  I plan to add some salsa, corn tortillas, and enchilada sauce to the leftovers for another dinner this week.  Thank you for this great recipe!

Definitely a good base but I did double the garlic and added fresh chopped tomatoes.  I also added 1/2 tsp of oregano and chopped a can of olives which I added at the end.  Kids and wife loved it!

Really good.  I was a little heavy handed on the cayenne so it was a bit hotter than we like.  But it made a ton and mixed with some chicken and a tiny bit of cheese I am looking forward to some healthy filling lunches next week!

Fast and easy, but lacking somewhat in the flavor department, even when adding a little Ro-Tel to zest it up a bit.  Next time, I might add some hot salsa.

This is my first review on here.  I'm a new vegetarian and I was very worried I wouldn't be able to find something really good...WOW.  This is one of the best things I've ever tasted!  And it was so easy to make.  The only things I did slightly differently was I used like 5 cloves of garlic (you can never have too much garlic!) and I did 3 sweet onions.  I was only going to do 2 at first (I love the sweet taste of sauteed onions!), but there was this third onion that kept falling out of the onion bag when I hung it up, so I just used it..."just because".  Anyway, I'm having a really hard time keeping myself from eating the whole pot right now.  It is REALLLY REALLLLY good.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that my young daughters like it.  They may not care for the spices...if so I will just make it without next time.  It's not too spicey for me as is, but I definitely wouldn't add more.  The spice level is just right for my taste.

As it stands I can only give it a 3. With the changes by the readers/reviewers .... this became a 5! My guests LOVED it. I added lamb stew meat, chopped into tiny pieces, and fresh chopped cilantro. I added diced tomatoes, corn, substituted kidney beans for the black beans (love black beans but didn't have any), Turmeric, Cumin, Black Pepper (didn't have cayenne) as per the other readers suggested and served it with Tortilla Chips. It turned out Awesome! :D

Great as a base recipe.  As per others' suggestions I added some corn, doubled the cumin and the garlic and added a can of roasted green chiles.  I also added a teaspoon of oregano, a bay leaf, 1 tsp turmeric and a packet and a half of Goya Sazon sin Annatto.

This is a great recipe to modify! It has great potential with lots of room to add. I added 3 boneless skinless chicken thighs and a cube of chipotle bouillon to the rice just before covering! It turned out great! I served it with warm tortillas and even my 4 year old boy devoured the meal! Thanks!

Very good, I already had precooked rice in the fridge and black beans I had boiled up the day before.  I chopped 3 small jalepenos into the onions and sauted them as well. Others said to add diced tomatoes, so I added some of my homemade salsa instead.  I added two cups of chicken broth.

Took other reviewers suggestions of adding corn and diced tomato.  Also added a little chicken.  Turned out pretty good.  Next time would add a little more cayenne as we tend to like a little more 'kick' to our food.

This is my go-to base recipe for beans and rice.  I usually add ground beef and tomatoes, and then some Worcester sauce, mustard powder and Adobo seasoning. So good...

Our family loved this dish!  The veggie broth added just the right amount of flavor.  We used the leftovers to make black bean enchiladas.

I followed the instructions and added some diced green chilies and a can of diced tomatoes. Still tasted a bit bland so I sprinkled some Taco Bell Taco Seasoning over the top and BINGO! It made all the difference in the world I also made the rice (Brown rice) in our rice maker and served the bean mix over the rice with a little blop of light sour cream on top. We enjoyed it more than we anticipated! Will definitely made this again!

I read the reviews before cooking and knew I would need to spice it up. Loved the addition of corn and green pepper.  A jar of hot salsa (one of my favorite short cuts) added the heat we love with black beans.

I liked this combination and the ease of preparation but felt it needed some salt/other seasoning.  Definitely a dish that you can add to and change to your liking.

I used brown rice instead of white rice.  A tad on the bland side so I kicked it up by adding apple cidar vinegar, salsa, cilantro, and diced onion.  NOW it's edible.  Served with baked chicken...very balanced meal.

I thought the dish was flavorful, but my husband wasn't impressed.  I had added canned tomatoes as other reviewers had suggested, and for ease, I cooked the dish in my rice cooker with no problem.  I served it with the chicken salsa dish from this site and some oven baked corn tortillas.  Light and definitely healthier than what you get  at a restaurant.

All rice in the house had been cooked, but I followed the directions, except actually cooking the rice in vegetable broth.  I sauteed the onion and garlic, then added the cooked rice with broth, seasonings and beans.  It was a decent side, but could have used some green onions, salsa, something.

I have been getting recipes from this site for a couple of years now, and I have never rated any.  However, I couldn't resist rating this one.  It was such a great recipe.  Very easy to make.  I read thru the reviews prior to making it and followed the advice of some others - added a can of corn and diced tomatoes.   Very tasty - if I could give it 10 stars I would.

I needed a quick, meatless lunch for the kids and I.  As written, I would give it maybe 3 stars. It seemed like a pretty bland recipe and I wasn't sure why the recipe submitter said to add the spices at the very end of the entire cooking process.  So I made adjustments to make it better suited for our tastes.  Instead of olive oil, I used organic coconut oil (better for you and gave a very very faint but yummy coconut flavor to the rice) to saute the onions and garlic in. I used more garlic that called for and I added a bit of pureed fresh ginger as well.  After I sautéed the rice for 2 minutes as the recipe calls for, then I added all the spices to include a teaspoon of turmeric and maybe 1/2 tsp of salt and a bit of pepper. I also added a chopped tomato with the veggie broth.  Once the rice was done (about 20 minutes) then I added the beans.  At the very end I adjusted the salt again and it was a nice, easy, nutritious meal for us.

I cooked my rice (1 cup brown rice) on its own and then added in sauteed onion, green and red pepper and celery.  Then added 3/4 tsp of cumin 1/4 tsp of cayenne and 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning.  I also used red beans in sauce.  The end result was awesome... it went really well with the roasted pork shoulder I cooked all day long!

This was the perfect side dish for Mexican Pork Chops (a recipe I also found on this site). I did use more olive oil and 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2. I also added a few small diced tomatoes from my garden. They added sweetness and a splash of color. This recipe would also be good with meat in it for tortillas. I will definately make this again! Thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful. I was looking for something to add last minute to a quick taco dinner when some unexpected guests showed up. I did not use the cayenne pepper because I have a young child and was worried about the spice. I did add a tablespoon of chopped fresh cilantro, which I love. It turned out very good and was good the next day warmed up again. My surprise guests devoured it, so I was very thankful!

This was really good! Probably could've used a little more liquid as mine dried up after only 14 min of simmering & the rice wasn't quite done, but still very easy & tasty. I tripled the cumin only because I love it!

Even with all of the add-ons mentioned in the reviews (cumin, tumeric, bell pepper, canned tomatoes, chicken broth, worcestershire sauce, hot sauce) this was still pretty underwhelming and trending towards bland.  If my version was bland, I'd imagine that the recipe as written has got to be even more so. I gave 2 stars because it was edible, but no more because I was pretty disappointed in how this turned out - I've had rice & beans that were 100x more flavorful than this. Not sure why this recipe got such high reviews when nearly everyone had to add something in to it.

I wanted to like this very much, but found it very bland and dry when prepared as-is. I rescued it with a can of tomatoes with chiles, extra broth, garlic and some extra spices (thrown in without measurement!--chili powder, a little of a southwestern blend and mexican oregano).

Something was missing...the flavor was really flat.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  I did add salt afterwords and that helped a bit, I wonder if adding it sooner would have helped more.  One thing I changed...I put the seasons in right after the onions cooked.  Should bring out the flavor more (even though it didn't)

Great recipe and good presentation! I was looking for a rice dish that I could make in advance. I followed the others Reviewers advice, and I used yellow rice. I will definitely make again.

As a college student, this recipe is PERFECT.  I took advice from other people who commented on this and added a chopped fresh tomato, saving as much juice as I could (but no chiles, because I didn't want a kick.)  I added salt and pepper to taste, as well as just plain ol' chili powder to taste. I did use a dash or two of Lawry's Seasoned Salt, and at the end added a can of pinto beans because it was too rice-heavy. Doubled the garlic, of course, and used chicken broth.  End result: SO DELICIOUS, great leftovers too!!!!

I didn't have veggie broth, so I just used the water that I cooked the beans in. Because of this I had to add some extra garlic and some season all. I also added corn and mushrooms. Very filling and delicious! Great inexpensive meatless main dish! I will be making this often!

Incredibly good!  I has instant rice, so I made it ahead of time.  Sauteed the onion and garlic with some red bell pepper, then added it to the rice with the beans, spices, chopped roma tomatoes and a little bit of corn.  When it was done, I sprinkled some fresh cilantro on top and added a small dollop of light sour cream.  It was a meal in itself!  My husband was very impressed that this healthy meal was so tasty!  He has encouraged me to make rice this way every time.

Wonderfully easy weeknight dinner. I had to substitute garlic powder in a pinch, and also subbed chicken broth for veggie. Added a can of drained diced tomatoes and kosher salt and pepper to taste. I think it needs some chips, guac, sour cream and salsa on the side!

extra easy recipe!  I made brown rice  and only used 1.5 cans of black beans, otherwise followed all the directions.  While tasty as is, I think it would need extra spice for me to make it again.

It's really rare that I don't agree with the general consensus, but hubby and I found this dish to be extremely bland, and that was even AFTER I added a TBP of chili powder and a can of corn.  We made it tasty by dumping in a large amount of salsa and a cornucopia of random spices.  As is, this just isn't spiced enough for our tastes.

This recipe is one I will be making all of the time now!  It is seriously the best and so healthy too.  I made it with brown rice and used only 1 can of black bean.  More beans than that would be too much for me.  Used chicken broth because it's what I had.  Also will leave out the cayenne next time as it just overpowers the other flavors.

This was delish! I made it with brown bastmati rice and added chili powder and oregano. I used chicken broth since that's what I had. It was the perfect side to chicken enchiladas!

Quite good as written, although I used chicken broth in place of the veg broth, because that was what I had. Would recommend adding diced canned tomatoes and corn as well. I also threw some sharp cheddar cheese on top and broiled for a few minutes which added some nice flavor as well. Very good pantry meal for a busy night. Tastes better the next day!

Good recipe. I would give it 5 stars after my additions: a can of ro-tel (it is spicy so maybe cut down on the cayenne if you don't like spice) and some salt and more garlic. I put it inside corn tortillas and it was delish! I can see using this as an enchilada filling with some sauce and cheese on top and throwing it in the oven on a busy night. I'm sure I will make this again, it was very easy and good.

3stars for a good starter recipe but, I took the advice of others and added 1can of sweet corn, can of diced tomatoes, a splash of lemon juice and used Beef broth before I saw that others were using chicken broth. For those who like a meatier flavor, Beef was very very good! Served over tortilla chips and some members of my family enjoyed it wrapped in a tortilla with a dollop of sour cream and topped with mexican blend shredded cheese. VERY VERY good! Thank you! Will definitely make again.

5 stars with modifications. I add fresh cilantro from my herb garden and plenty of lime juice. I also add cayenne pepper and some crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat. Serve with shredded cheese and sour cream on top to balance out the heat from the pepper. My husband loves it with white tortilla chips to scoop up the rice and beans. Absolutely simple and flavorful!

This was a good basic recipe.  I altered it (which is why I only gave 3) with some bell peppers, corn and peas for color.  For my non-vegetarian husband, I added chorizo sausage.  But the base recipe is good.

Made this last night for dinner and it was very, very good plus easy and quick.  I subbed chicken stock for the veggie broth and needed to add more for the rice to fully cook.  I added the beans and spices when I added the stock so the beans would cook down a little.  I didn't add the cayenne but the flavor was still wonderful.

I changed up a few things: added 1 can Rotel, used paprika, cumin and some Cajun seasoing. Also, I drained and rinsed the beans to get rid of some sodium. For a last minute, thrown together meal this was REALLY good. My husband raved for several days! :) Thank you!

I thought this was very good.  You MUST do a couple of things...in browning the rice, keep the burner low  or the rice WILL burn. And stir it now and then to prevent burning.  Add the cayenne pepper and cumin BEFORE adding in the beans. It's just easier in terms of adding the beans and then mixing them with the rice.  I used 3 cans of Progresso black beans. I think they were 14 or 15 oz. each.  I, like others, cut the cayenne pepper and cumin in half or more just because the spiciness would do me in so adjust accordingly.

This is really good. I did have a bit of trouble with the rice sticking to the pot, so I would suggest stirring fairly often about 7 minutes after adding the broth. The cayenne pepper made it a little bit spicy, which isn't bad, but I wasn't expecting it, so next time I'll either use less cayenne or try paprika.

This was delicious! I served it with the oven-fried catfish recipe from here too.  I left out the cumin and mixed in two cups of cheddar and only one can of beans.  My husband said it was better than a restaurant.

This was good.  Though it would be a great side dish, I used it as a base for veggie burritos with homemade guacamole, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream.  However, I think that the next time I'm going to eliminate the cumin and possibly the cayenne pepper.  I want something more like the rice and beans I've had in Latin America and the cumin was a little overpowering, and I like the good black bean flavor.  It's a good base to modify as you wish.

Great,easy,recipe. I used brown rice. Sauteed onion, garlic, celery and tomato with the cumin and extra cayenne. Added the beans to this for 2 minutes at the end and then mixed in the cooked rice. The flavors blended beautifully. Will add diced jalapenos next time.

I think this recipe is very good.  I added 1 T oregano with the broth and cooked with rice.  I used 2 t cumin, 2 t tumeric, and added 1 can of diced tomatoes at the end.  My 19 month old ate 2 1/2 bowls and my other 2 kids finished their first bowl.  3 kids eating what is served is a rarity.

We love this recipe! My husband requests it frequently now, and I was surprised that I like it, too! The great this is that as long as you keep the broth & rice proportional, you can use whatever amount of rice or beans you have. (I often use up our leftover burrito beans using this recipe!)

As is, the recipe is about 3 stars but when I added a few special ingredients it became a 5! I used chicken stock as that's what I had on hand instead of the veggie broth. The basic recipe seemed like it would be very bland so I threw in a can of diced tomatoes, half a seeded diced jalapeno, more garlic, a red onion and extra cumin, salt, pepper and cayenne. I also added a seeded diced poblano pepper. They are wonderful! Smaller then a green bell pepper but with a very similar taste. The poblano has a more intense pepper flavor with a mild heat, not spicy at all. I love to use them in chili and rice dishes. Towards the end of cooking I threw in about a tablespoon of chopped fresh cilantro. These additions really made this dish more flavorful and interesting. Had the rice with fish tacos with mango salsa. Delicious!!

One of the best Rice & Beans recipes I've tried - I thought this was really tasty. I used Kidney & Black Beans, and added chopped tomatoes from my garden. I did think the recipe called for some salt. Try it with a dollop of sour cream!

Delicious! I made the following changes: 1) added a can of diced tomatoes, 2) used two tablespoons of garlic (i love garlic!), 3) added 1 tsp each of cayenne and chili powder, and 4) used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock to give the dish more flavour.

This is also known as gallo pinto! Costa Rica's national dish. It's easy and really good, but I usually prepare it without the chicken broth (with is better), and use a lot more rice, and dried black beans, which are soaked overnight before cooking. I recommend a lot of chopped cilantro!

This was just ok. My husband really didn't like it at all. It's way too bland as is, and would require too much tweaking for me to make again. I also had to add WAY more water than recipe called for.

Good basic recipe.  After reading other reviews, I also made some adjustments.  I added a can of rotel, a can of mexicorn, and used some cajun seasonings and hot sauce.  I also used instant brown rice to speed it up a bit.  Tasted great!

This is a really great recipe.  The cumin adds alot of flavor.  To make it healthier I made it with brown rice.  I added a can of southwestern style diced tomatoes and cilantro and then used this as a filling for burritos.  I added sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese and my husband and I loved it.  We try to eat 2 or 3 meals a week vegetarian and this will be added to our list.

Very good!  I used beef stock that I made, which flavored it up a good deal.  I agree with other posters that cilantro is a good addition, as well.  I enjoyed the dish plain, and I also rolled some up in a tortilla shell with some cheese and sour cream!  Yum!

This was a really easy, good recipe! I did some modifications however. I used beef stock instead of vegetable broth. I also added tomatoes, salsa verde, corn, black pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and a bit of salt. I also browned some ground beef and spiced it with taco seasoning. I put the beef on the bottom of the bowl, then the bean mixture, and melted mozza/cheddar cheese on top and topped it off with sour cream! YUMMY!

This was a good recipe, very simple to make.  

I made this into a complete meal by adding diced tomatoes, cilantro, and pulled pork for BBQ (recipe on the site - did not add the BBQ sauce, just put the pork into the mix).  This was tasty and quick!

Great recipe. I did add 2 fresh chopped tomatos and could have added 3 or 4 based on the amount. I used 2 cans of black beans which I rinsed off before adding. Overall a wonderful recipe - will make again.

I really like this - so easy, healthy and tasty. I cut the recipe in half so I wouldn't have a ton of leftovers and it worked out well. I did have to add a little extra water/stock and extra time for my rice to finish cooking. But when it was done it was very good.

i made this for a family gathering, and it was hardly touched, although I like the spice that the cayenne brought to the rice

Oh my gosh!  This is one of my favorite meals!  I only changed a few things - added 3/4 cup each of chopped red and green bell peppers and the spices while sauteeing the onion and garlic.  Served in lettuce leafs (kind of like a vegan, gluton-free burrito).  It was delicous!  Even my meat-loving husband was completely satisfied with this dish!  Thanks for the recipe.

Finally!!  A rice dish that has some flavour! :) :)  I did what others suggested and added the spices to the olive oil.  I dissolved some Knorr vegetable broth and threw the whole works into the rice cooker.  When it was done, I added the black beans.  It was great, easy, and I will be making it again.

I changed a few things and added some chopped cilantro and some chopped jalapenos to give more flavor and some extra cumin. It turned out great! All the roommates ate and ate and then it was gone. It really worked out for us b/c one of the roomates is vegatarian and she always gets left out when it comes to dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe - however, I did change a few things due to personal taste (we like salt!):

At the beginning, cooked the onion & garlic in olive oil WITH the spices - plus a little bit of fresh chopped cilantro.  Used a whole can of veggie broth (had to still add lots of water), and added a generous dousing of salt during cooking, and another dash of cumin & fresh chopped cilantro at the end when I added the drained black beans (used a whole 14.5 oz can here).

Though I usually add green & red bell pepper to a recipe like this, I opted out and served it with corn & fresh chopped green & red bell pepper on the side (to kill the spicy aftertaste).  

I served this with the idea of this other recipe I stumbled upon by "Sara" (also on this site) - Chile Pork.  I subbed in cubed pork chop meat and cooked it over the stove, following the rest of her recipe.  The three together (Black beans and rice by Robyn Webb, Chile Pork by Sara, and the corn / red & green bell pepper veggie side) were a GREAT combination!

Thanks for the recipe - this one is a keeper!  Not too spicy, not too bland =)

I really liked this recipe. I'm a vegetarian (and eat dairy and eggs sparingly) my husband is an omnivore so this is one of those things we can all eat. I made pretty much according the the recipe adding a can of drained garlic tomatoes at the end. Then I put the mixture in whole wheat tortillas and topped with cheese for the rest of the family... I ate it twice the first day and then again for lunch the next day and I usually hate leftovers. Yummy.

Wow - this was much better than I expected it to be.  I usually make my rice in a rice cooker, but followed the directions for this recipe and was not disappointed.  I served it with fajitas and roasted kernal corn, and it was a hit.  In fact, I abandoned my fajitas and just ate beans and rice with some corn stirred in.  It was just what I was looking for - thanks!

Thanks for the much needed new idea for a side dish.  I made it with 1 can of drained kidney beans, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was delicious.  The cumin gave it a really nice flavour.

I've made this several times now and I love this with a few minor adjustments for my personal taste. I'm not a fan of cumin so I cut that down by about half, and I add a touch more cayenne to compensate for flavor and a good sprinkling of cilantro. I also like to add some frozen corn (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup) during the last few minutes for that extra little crunchy sweetness. If you want a little tang spritz with a little lime juice if you're in the mood right before you eat it. Delicious!

This dish was excellent! I made some minor adjustments because I used boil in-the-bag brown rice. I made the rice separate from the beans, so the veg. broth was not needed. I seasoned the beans with a lot of different spices and some cayenne pepper for an extra kick. I served the beans over the rice, added some chunky salsa (medium) and topped it off with a sprinkle of shredded parmesan cheese. It was delicious! It was like a vegan low carb burrito!

I made this exactly as written (only halved) and it's not only so easy, but tasty as well.  I did add a splash more broth when it came time to stir in the beans and spices and it was perfect.  Very filling, too.

I was looking for the recipe which is similar to my favorite boxed black bean and rice. I guess this is close. I did few changes to suit my taste however. I used 3/4 short grain brown rice with 2 cups vegetable broth and 1 1/2 cup chicken broth. Added 2/3 tsp cayenne pepper, 2/3 tsp chilli powder and about 1 tsp pepper flakes. I know it probably sounds crazy to some people, but I love spicy food. Even with this extra addtion, it is not that spicy for me. I added a couple dashes of italian seasoning to give it more flavor. It turns out great. Thanks for the recipe!

DELISH! I made this rice for my meat-eating family, and my vegetarian self. It gave me a great source of protein with an excellent taste! My Dad and brother, who are both picky eaters when it come to food without meat in it, loved it! I will definatley make this rice again!

I thought that this rice was just ok, nothing spectacular. I probably would not make this again. I thought that the flavor lacked a little something and the cumin didnt really do anything for me. Maybe I should have added red pepper flakes or cajun seasoning or something.

Good recipe.  I used brown rice (so I had to cook it longer and use a little more broth)& I cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/8 t. for the kids.  I also used chicken broth because I had that on hand.  It couldn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't "I can't stop eating it" good, but it we did like it and I'll probably make it again.

Great recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (only because I had it on hand).  This is a fantastic recipe!  Great source of carbs, especially if you use brown rice!  Thanks for sharing :)

Delicious and healthy.  Like others, I use brown rice, and cook it in water with a little bit of garlic powder and onion powder to flavor it.  I like it spicey, so I use more cumin and pepper.  I serve it with a dollop of sour cream on the side.

I thought the recipe was very bland. Not much flavor.  It might have more flavor if I had used chicken broth. My husband did not care for it either.
I will not be making it again.

This dish was so flavorful! I really enjoyed it, my husband loved it!  I was worried that it may be too salty (i used reg chicken broth, instead of low sodium veg broth...so if you are worried about it being too salty, then do make sure to use a low sodium broth), but my husband thought it was perfect.  My 6 year old thought it was a little too spicy (from the cayenne pepper), so I would suggest adding the cayenne pepper to taste.. if you're picky about spicyness, but I thought it was absolutely wonderful.  My husband also commented on how wonderful it would be in a burrito, which i completely agreed with, although I also think it makes a great meal by itself.

I LOVE this recipe! I make up the whole batch and keep it in the fridge for a few days. I do add a bit more cumin than the recipe calls for and use dried chicken granules instead of canned broth. My favorite thing to serve it with is grilled chicken marinated in Lawry's Havana Garlic and Lime marinade.  YUM! Oh, and I think it tastes wonderful reheated.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I had to add a lot to make this palatable... diced tomatoes, lots of spices (green chilies, more cumin, thyme, salt, more coriander, chili powder, tarragon). It wasn't bad once I played with it, but as is I didn't find it very tasty. I also used brown rice, because I love it.

Quick, easy and delicious.  It doesn't get much better than that.  My husband and I both like more flavor so I was generous with the spices.  I also added more stock so that the rice would fully cook.  Though my husband commented that "it's no steak," he still enjoyed every last bite.  This one will definitely be made again.

Very good & easy. I used canned black beans with jalepenos but only 1C and added 1C white corn - replaced half of the water with chicken broth. You can really make this your own! My family loved it. I know I will make this often.

Good and easy. I didn't have broth, so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes, 1/2 tsp. seasoning salt, and water. It turned out very well and the whole family loved it. NO leftovers! This one goes into the rotation.

Very tasty.  I served this as a side dish with tamales, and it was just right.  Also would be good w/ smoked sausage. Two things to note...I wasn't crazy about grey rice (which happens when you mix it w/ the beans), and I added a little hot sauce to give it that extra kick.

This dish was a hit my family and me.  I didn't have corn on hand so I simply omitted it, and used chili powder in place of cayenne pepper for the same reason. Very pleased to have another vegan recipe I can throw together in a short period of time.

Very tasty and easy! I'd give 5 stars, but didn't try it as written.  As others suggested, I used 1 can black beans, 1 can corn (both drained) and 1 can Rotel tomatoes (undrained).  Put 1/8 tsp cayenne & the cumin in with the rice while it cooked.  Very grateful to find this recipe, since I had limited supplies and didn't want to go to the store!

Meh. As is, this recipe does not have a lot of flavour. I added a can of corn and rotel brand tomatoes and much more seasoning. I had a super spicy salsa that I mixed in. Turned out more like a burrito bowl. Topped with cheese and sour cream!

I made the recipe as written with the exception of not adding the full amount of beans. I was combining the rice and beans and after adding one can of beans which was about 1 and 3/4 cups, I felt like that was the perfect amount of beans to rice ratio for my liking.
      Next time I will rinse the beans in water and then drain, instead of just draining the liquid from the can.  When I did combine the rice and beans and stirred them together, the rice took on a dirty or gray color vs. staying white.   If I would have rinsed the beans first in water, I think it would have looked prettier or more appealing.

Added two tomatoes, one chicken breast pre-cooked and diced, and put it on tortillas for a taco type meal. Pretty good; would recommend lime juice and cilantro if you don’t have the “cilantro tastes like soap” gene

This recipe is very basic. I personally  like for my food to have a lot of flavor. I added a bunch of garlic powder, onion powder, and a bunch of Cajun seasoning. I also used dry beans which I cooked fresh instead of canned beans. After all of the changes I think it was pretty good.

I made this even quicker, I used my power  pressure cooker. Sautéed onions, garlic and rice. Placed all of the other ingredients into the inner pot. (I used regular long grain rice) I despise instant rice. Set it on the Rice button (which is  7 min. On high. Quick release, stirred and served. It was perfect!

I followed the general recipe but used riced cauliflower instead.  I also added sriracha along with lime juice, Minor's chicken base, diced tomatoes, 2 tsp cumin, red kidney beans (instead of black) and Cento tomato paste.  Very yummy results.  Thanks for the base recipe!

Made as written, except used only a 15 oz. can of black beans, which was enough.  Love the taste of cumin and it made this side dish!  Served chunks of Caribbean roast pork (done in a crockpot this time) over the top of this rice and beans with thickened gravy from the meat.  Oh yeah...so good!

This was so yummy. I followed the recipe, but used chicken bouillon instead of veg broth. I stirred in about 1/4 cup of salsa just before serving. Will definitely make again!

I would have made it five stars if they had not used beans in a can and quick rice . 

I made it using fresh and/or made from scratch foods. My total cost to make this was less than $2.00. Served six using half pound of rice and half pound of beans. 

Fast. Easy. High in protein.  Tastes great!

I made this for  my husband and he very rarely says "This looks really healthy" and "This tastes really nice" in the same breath! I used a 3-grain rice that took longer to cook and more water/stock, and spiced it with paprika and cayenne for husband. I added tomatoes from seeing a few reviews. I will definitely make this again. Thank you. PS I am a beginner/novice at cooking.

I was pleasantly surprised by how well it turned out. I subbed brown rice for white, doubled the recipe, and added 1/2 tsp chipotle and 3 diced fresh tomatoes.

Flavour wise I loved it! I tried using brown rice for a healthy kick, and unfortunately even with double the liquid my rice was kind of uncooked. Next time I’ll get it right!

This recipe is yummy! Def will make again. My little change: I added the spices and added more fresh garlic and turmeric during the first step. I used organic chicken broth to cook rice with above. I also added fresh cilantro with the beans.

I made this exactly as shown except without cayenne pepper (all out(substituted with red pepper flakes and a little paprika) and it tasted amazing.  Sure you can up the flavor with this or that but I LOVE this recipe because it's SIMPLE!

1 can of black beans was enough for the amount of rice the recipe calls for, so I'm not sure why the recipe called for 3.5 cups.

I used brown rice instead of white, so I needed 2 cups of broth and it had to simmer for 40 minutes. 

Followed others' suggestions: used chicken broth, added more cumin and garlic powder and a little cayenne pepper.

Also added 1 can drained Rotel tomatoes, squeezed fresh lime on individual servings and topped with fresh cilantro and crumbled goat cheese.

For me, it works better to use a bit more olive oil to saute the garlic and onion, as well as to saute on low heat. I also prefer to use one cup of rice. Absolutely delicious and an awesome comfort food!! It's easy, too. It's in the dinner rotation at our house. 5 stars!

Didn't have regular white rice so used basmati rice.  Came out light and fluffy.  It was a bit bland but once we put some hot salsa on top, it was delicious with BBQ chicken.

Awesome as a side or make a few protein adjustments for a main dish. Recipe is very versatile and the family loves black beans  and I really like cilantro and bacon in some fashion in anything I make.

Based on other reviews, I prepared the rice as instructed & the spices called for. Instead of 3 cans black beans,  I used one can each of black beans, corn, & Rotel. It is a good basic recipe to tweet according to your own taste buds; we like things a bit spicier & the  Rotel helped zip up the flavor.

Way too bland even after adding additional spices plus diced tomatoes, green chile & corn. Toppings like cheese, sour cream, cilantro, hot sauce etc helped a lot but I still wouldn’t make this again.

Had low sodium red beans in a can, rinsed can with white wine to get all beans out. Added chopped celery and bell pepper, no garlic to onions but will next time. Used gr. chipotle pepper (out of cayenne tonite) and added fresh gr. nutmeg and celery seed to saute. Added splash tarragon vinegar when onions were ready, then beans, finally brown rice. Coming off BRAT diet so needed to kick up the rice a notch.

This is definitely a keeper for our family. I did follow the suggestions of someone else and added a can of rotel tomatoes. I might add some fresh jalapeno next time just to increase the heat level. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth but that is just a personal preference. Good flavors and super easy.

Good, but only after I added a can of Rotel and used a can of lite coconut milk plus 1/2 to 1  cup water instead of the veggie broth. I did increase the spices  because we like things fairly spicy, but I served salsa on the side so folks could choose their own heat level.. It's also very important to rinse the rice thoroughly. I doubled the recipe and used both small red kidney and black beans. Actually I've changed the recipe so much that it doesn't bear much resemblance to the original, but at least it got me experimenting and I ended up creating something the whole family really enjoyed..

Simple but delicious.  Great as a side with bbq meat, or as a quick healthy lunch. I add chopped fresh tomato

This was just great as it was.  I might try it with some corn next time but it is fantastic as is.  For sure you should adjust the heat to your families liking.

This is really good! I used 2 cans of black beans and one can of chick peas and swapped the white rice for brown. I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and it  was very flavorful. Yummy and easy dish!

This is one of my basic recipes.  However, I use brown rice, turkey or chicken bone broth.  This is a great recipe to add fav veggies instead of corn.  I like to add spinach or kale.  It's easy to substitute quinoa or use lentils instead of black beans.  Very good recipe!

Only 4 because I forgot the cumin and cayene Looking forward to making it again with the added flavor.  I used corn that I
took off the cob and made this a one pot dish by cooking the 
onions and garlic in a pot and then adding the rice and broth
and cooking it all together. Yummy easy.

Excellent!  I made no changes except to put the seasonings, rice, and chicken broth into my rice cooker.  Then I added the beans after the rice was done.  It was very, very good.

This recipe is really delicious--I love making it in my VitaClay rice cooker. Easy, quick and so yummy! The broth and the oil really bring out flavor and make it a super satisfying dish, even on its own!

I give it 4 stars because I had to make adjustments. For example I used chicken broth( a can and a half) . I also added corn and cilantro to the mix. Added also jalapeño to it to add spice and btw the corn and beans were home made!!! I did not use canned items except for the chicken broth. And as for salt it needed a little more, I used 1 tablespoon of it. O and I added some garlic salt:))

Although it's the first time I have rated it I've made it several times. This is a good dish, a main dish for some, an excellent side with ribs or chicken for others. I spiced it up up a bit with cayenne, about 1.5. Tsp and twice as much paprika.

This was such a quick and easy recipe, and very good.  At the very end I added 2 ten oz cans of Rotel tomatoes with lime and cilantro and a handful of frozen corn kernels.  Delicious!  Thank you for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Put everything in my rice cooker. Delish! Cheyenne pepper adds a good heat. Will make again.

Found it too dry and a bit to Cumin-y. We ended up eating it with a side of plain Greek yogurt which added a nice tartness and creaminess to the dish. Liked it better that way but not sure I would make it again.

I give this 5 stars because it provided a good base for me to work off of. Here's what I did: used brown rice instead of white,  chicken broth instead of veggy, doubled the cumin, replaced cayenne pepper with chili powder, red beans instead of black and only had 3 c. worth and added 1/2 c. corn. Added 1 whole diced roma tomato. Sprinkled some taco seasoning and a splash of lime juice. Put it all in corn tortillas. I only did all these changes because I didn't have the exact ingredients listed!

I enjoyed the flavors of the dish. I only had dry black beans.  So I had to soak them and them cook them for about 2 hrs.  I added some of the seasoning to the beans while cooking them before mixing them with the seasoned rice.  The dish was simple to make and I plan to make it again.

The recipe was really good but I don't understand why it doesn't tell you to cook the beans. The canned beans were really hard even after I cooked it for about ten minutes. Next time I'll make sure to simmer it for a long time with the beans.

My family and I liked this recipe. I did make some changes after reading many reviews prior to making it.  I added about a cup of frozen corn along with only one can of black beans, one small can of diced tomatoes, changed the broth to chicken, and added a little  precooked chicken, cheddar cheese, sour cream(if desired) and tortilla chips to each bowl.  It was delicious!  My 11 year old dd came back for seconds after having a big bowl for firsts. It had a pretty good kick to it which I liked, but be aware of it. My dd normally doesn't like spicy food, but as noted, really liked this recipe!

Loved this recipe. My kids don't like onions and they saw me cooking it and were suspicious at first, but when they tasted it they were converted. They ate every bite and nobody complained. BTW, I followed the recipe to a t except I used brown rice instead of white rice.

Made it nearly to the recipe...more garlic (always more garlic). Cooked up hot Italian sausage, cut into coin sized pieces in separate pan. When both the rice and the sausage were done cooking, we mixed the two together and served. Will do again with same combined recipe.

I subbed red kidney beans because that's what I had on hand, and used chicken broth for the same reason. We also cut the cayenne way down because I just can't take too much of it. Finally, I added kielbasa to the dish (just a bit). We loved it.

Surprisingly tasty for how simple it is. We substituted chicken stock for veg, added bacon and green peppers, and omitted the onion simply because I hate onion. Super easy and tasty.

Added a splash of Frank's to make it a little less plain. Not bad for a healthier recipe. I think I would use this as part of making a meat burrito/tacos, but not by itself.

I used kamut instead of rice and added the tomatoes with chiles and 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp tumeric  with the lime and chicken broth  It was all gone. I also like to smash my garlic for more flavor.

I was already making rice in the rice cooker, so I just added it to the cooked onions, garlic, black beans and seasonings. My daughter loved it and told me to make it again. My husband liked it too! If I was just making it for him,  I would of added some diced tomatoes, but since she doesn't care for tomatoes, this was a hit, just the way it was.  I'm planning on making more and freezing it, so she can heat it up, anytime she likes.

Good, with additions many of the reviews stated. Personally, we felt the original recipe needed a few changes, so this is what ours looked like:

Diced tomatoes (1 can) 
black beans (1.5 cans) 
Sweet corn (about half a can or less, mostly for color - add til it looks right). 
White Rice (1.75 cups)

We added fried sweet plantains and avocados on top for our second serving, and found it to be an excellent addition.

An excellent recipe for a good cheap meal. The recipe is fine as is...but...tonight I kicked it up by adding some corn, tomatoes, salsa, green peppers, and celery.

Tomorrow will probably add some shreaded chicken and cheese to the left overs and make tacos or burritos.

It's not one of my favorites - rather bland.  Interestingly, the picture shows kernel corn, but the recipe doesn't list it.

Simple, fast, and tasty enough to be a go-to side or vegan main dish.   I made it as written and will make it again.  Recipe also lends itself to add-ins  for your preferred color, texture or "herbiness" without needing to add salt or other spices.  This is also good eaten cold!

Really wanted to like this but it turned out pretty bland for me. I tasted after making as written, and then added a can of diced tomatoes with chiles and some fresh corn as others suggested, but was still disappointed. Will keep looking for a good beans and rice recipe...

This recipe was good. I added more garlic and cumin and it was delicious. It's a good base recipe and you can add other ingredients to make it your own. I would make this again and it was super simple.

As written this is one of my favorite recipes. I only add diced kielbasa or Polish sausage if I have any on hand. Subtle flavors are good sometimes! (Even the thought of adding diced tomatoes to this feels wrong, would ruin the dishes simplicity.)

I made this, but took everyone's advice on adding tumeric, one can of rotel tomato and chili, added a can of corn, of course added chopped bacon, cilantro, green onions, used red onions instead of white.  This recipe was good, but I agree with everyone it needed some tweeking.  It's good with the bacon, nice smokey flavor.

This is a basic recipe for everyone - whether experienced or not. However, the flavor is kind of plain. My version is to double every spice, plus add in oregano, parsley, and paprika.  Spices need to be added while sauteing onions, in order to release the flavor.

A few changes, I made brown rice in rice cooker, used only 2 cans of black beans instead of the 3 1/2 cups they called for. I added andouille chicken sausage and a can of chopped tomatoes with cilantro with an extra teaspoon of cumin. MMM Good!

I just made this for a lunch at work; it's really good. I did add a can of corn, omitted the cayenne, added 2 tsp cumin and 2 tsp turmeric as advised by another rating, and also added some lime juice and cilantro to taste. It's great, and I'll make it again.

This is a tasty base recipe but it needs more spices and lime juice.

Very easy to make. Just not a 5 due to it being just a little bland for my taste. I would say it's a great basic meal that can easily be tweaked to your taste. Green chili's were a nice addition. I'll keep at it. Give it a try.

This is a good base for a tasty black beans and rice recipe. I followed the recipe except I used chicken stock instead of vegetable broth to cook the rice. When it was done I tasted it and thought it was bland. I stirred in about half a can of corn and some kosher salt. Definitely made it better. Then I served  a spoonful of the beans and rice mixture into corn tortilla bowls and sprinkled cheese over the rice, a dollop of sour cream, and homemade salsa. That did it. Without the salsa, the recipe wouldn't have been as good. My husband went back for seconds and my 6 year old said, "This is good!" I do find it ironic that this recipe is from the American Diabetes Association. I am a diabetes specialist and my version of the recipe did increase the carb count somewhat (if using the tortilla bowl and corn) but overall, this remains a healthy recipe. It would even be good without the tortilla bowl and served with shredded lettuce like a taco salad without the taco. :) Use it as a side dish with chicken or slice some chicken over this bed of rice and beans. Wrap the rice and beans in a tortilla or serve it with tortilla chips. The options are endless!!

I had to add other things to bring this recipe alive.  I can't give the recipe a good rating because it was so bland.
Added 1/2 c V8 while simmering rice.
Can of diced tomatoes with chilies. (drained)
Next time I may not drain and omit the V8.  
Can of corn (drained).
Only used one can of black beans and did not drain.
A little green pepper.
Maybe I will add more rice next time.  
No cayenne.
A little spicy for the kids.   Next time diced tomatoes without the chilies. 
I used beef broth because that is what I had on hand.

This is a great tasting recipe that's cheap! It's filling and delicious. I did have to add more veggie broth though. Not sure why, but it turned out great!

Got some great feedback at home so I will definitely make this again! Although, I did add some other veggies to it...like bell peppers (red/yellow/orange), and frozen corn. All sauted in a separate pan with some olive oil, garlic, salt & black pepper. Also, I didn't have any broth so I used a veggie bouillion + half a mushroom bouillion dissolved in a bit of hot and then added cold water. I didn't have any cayenne papper so I used chili powder instead and found that with this and the cumin it's better to sprinkle little by little until you are happy with the taste. Btw, I used basmati rice and  served with bbq pork chop. Thanks for sharing!

I changed up this recipe quite a bit actually, so the 5 stars is for my own version! Here is what I did:

1. I used leeks instead of onions (just a personal preference), doubled the number of garlic cloves, and used jalapenos as well. 

2. Instead of white rice, I went the healthier route and did multi colored quinoa instead. 

3. I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth for more flavor. 

4. I added fire-roasted diced tomatoes with its juice just before putting in the chicken broth. 

5. I doubled all the spices and added turmeric as well. 

6. For some more protein, I also added some shrimp in the last 8 minutes or so for it to cook.  It only took one pan and it was FANTASTIC!

Good side dish!  I read some of the other reviews and saw they mentioned the recipe could be bland so I did make a few changes for our preferences.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable because its what we had on hand, I added a can of rotel to the mix and some chili powder.  Loved the flavor and how easy the recipe was.  Can't wait to make it again.

Very good.  Next time I would add a can of Rotel and maybe some roasted corn to make it a more rounded dish.  I liked the 'bite'...not too much, just great flavor.  Almost made me feel like saying 'Y'all' or 'bless your heart' or 'caddywonked'.  Very southern.

Not bad at all.  I personally wanted a bit more salt, you may want something else, but in any case it'll be at least a solid start for most I think.

I'll never make another boxed mix again.  This was excellent.  Cayenne produced a little bite, cumin levels were great for my family.  Forgot to measure the beans and used 1 can, which was enough as a side dish.  Not quite enough beans for a main dish.  I'll use 2 cans next time, which is probably closer to the recipe anyway.  Might have to up the spices if I do add more beans, as it was just perfect the way I made it.

This was an excellent side dish. I followed the direction, but threw in a can of Rotel tomatoes (the lime spiced up version). A couple of my children thought it a little too spicy, but most of us thought it was perfect.

Excellent! Doubled the garlic,heavy on the onions and used chicken broth. Even better when adding 1 lb. Andouille and/or Cajun Chicken sausauge sliced  and a diced green bell pepper! I make this frequently now.

I agree that the recipe in and of itself was very boring.  Since I figured this out along the way, I added red capsicum to the onions and garlic, more garlic, lots of coriander, a teaspoon of Massel veggie stock, a tin of crushed tomatoes and some chili.  Then we had something yummy that we'll return to often.

So far this is my favorite rice & bean dish.  I went heavy on the onion, used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and added a 1/2 tsp of paprika.  I also used beef bullion since that was all I had in the house.

Great recipe! Some changes that I made after reading other reviews:
I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock (better flavor) and I also added bacon pieces. I would make this again, except adding more bacon, it really complimented everything and left me want more bacon flavor. I sautéed the bacon with the onion before adding anything else. I then added the rice and sautéed for about 2 minutes, finally adding the chicken stock. When I added the beans and the seasoning I through in a pinch of cayenne (I like it spicy!). The bacon made everything better :)

Great, simple recipe.  I use 1tsp of home made meat rub and 1tsp home chipotle chili powder instead of the cumin and cayenne.  I also added  package of chicken andouille sausage,  sliced and chopped, to the rice and onion as it sautéed before adding the broth.

Since I've been trying to eat a primarily natural vegan diet (no tofu and other processed vegetarian/vegan foods) I've been trying to find good, filling recipes. This is definitely a keeper. I added 4-5 cloves of garlic instead of 2 because, let's be honest, you can't get enough garlic. I also used a medium sized onion. I used brown rice instead of white, and added a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Didn't have cayenne, so used the cumin and added some tumeric. I did have to use a lot of homemade veggie broth because of the brown rice, and that added salt to the recipe. Next time I'll probably use half veggie broth and half water. Roasted some corn and had that as a side. Topped it off with some guacamole. Overall very good dish. Will be making it again.

He used granulated chicken boullion in the water for rice and we only had one can of black beans, so we added a can of corn and fresh chopped tomatoes. And he doubled the cumin and cayenne. This dish is fabulous!! Full of flavor!!

added 1 can corn and 1 can diced tomatos.  It was very good but more of a light lunch or side dish item.  I also used wild rice in place of white rice but cooked per directions.  Great little dish.

This was very good, and my family DEVOURED it!!!  I did tweak the recipe by adding the cumin and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper when I added the broth, so the flavors would cook into the rice.  I also added a can of drained corn when I added the beans.  YUMMMMMMM!!!

I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and used Sazon goya instead of the cumin and cayenne but still found it lacking so I added a can of Rotel and that spiced it up perfectly!

Very good! My only problem with it was that it was a bit spicey for my taste, but I'm not a fan of spicey foods anyways, and I simply added less cayenne pepper so it's all good!

I made this tonight for dinner.  I'm giving it four stars even though we were not that impressed.  I think it would have been much better if I had used the amount of cumin the recipe called for instead of doubling it as someone suggested.  It was much better with a little shredded Mexican cheese on top.  I only used one and a half cups of beans which I feel was plenty.  Next time I'm going to try adding cilantro and diced green pepper.  We thought this would be pretty good on tortillas with some avocado and a dab of sour cream so we'll try that.

This was delicious, and the only changes I made were using brown rice (cooking time increases to about 20-45 min but it's much healthier) and chicken broth. I think this would be very good with a combo of black and red beans.

This recipe was great!  If you're looking for spicy, this isn't your recipe, but I wasn't cause I was feeding it to my 2 year old.  Anyway, I didn't have cayenne pepper so I substituted a little hot sauce in it's place.  Also, as other reviewers mentioned, I doubled the cumin.  It was PERFECT.  Thanks for the great recipe. I will be making this again!

This is pretty good.  I make some alterations, though.  I use brown rice, which takes a lot longer to cook, so I just make the rice like I normally would but substitute vegetable broth for the water.  Then I saute the garlic and onion separately and mix all the ingredients together when the rice is almost done.  I also double all the spices to give it a little more kick.  It's a pretty good recipe.

I did this one, taking the general advice to add to the mix. This recipe is an *amazing* base for adding things to. I tripled the cumin and cayenne, added a half teaspoon of salt, about a teaspoon of  ground black pepper, 6 or 7oz diced bacon, and a dozen minced scallions alongside the onion. It's amazingly filling, tasty, and there's plenty of it. I can see this becoming one of my staples.

This was delicious and much lower in fat than any beans and rice recipe I've encountered.  The toasted rice added a nice richness to the dish.    Based on previous reviews, I did double the cumin and cayenne, and I'll probably add even more next time.

The ONLY thing I did different was added 1/2 tsp salt, some fresh ground pepper and about 1 tsp of onion salt. It was so awesome that my grandma scarfed down 4 helpings then got up to get some paper to write the recipe on. Anyone that didn't like it is nuts :o)

This is so easy because you can modify the recipe in many ways.  I didn't have anything but beef broth, so used that.  When I sauteed the garlic and onions I added a few dashes of crushed red pepper for some zip.  Also tossed in some green pepper and seared chicken.  Scrumptious!

A good standby; I eat this as a one-dish meal and get about 5-6 dinners out of it (standalone). I followed other reviewers' advice and add a can of diced tomatoes and corn; I also add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and an additional 1/4 tsp of the cayenne.

As written it an easy 4 star recipe, but I doubled the rice but not the spices and I found it spicy, but plain. So I added shrimp and that made it a 5 star recipe. I will make this again. Super easy and healthy.

Not bad but not great as it is. I added shredded carrots to the rice, 1 tsp of turmeric, more cayenne pepper, a T. of lime juice, and diced tomatoes to improve the flavor.

I pretty much followed this recipie but I eat brown rice and substituted that.  Also, instead of vegitable broth i used water and GOYA ham base, which is calorie and fat free!  Wonderful!

Delicious and easy. I used chicken broth instead of the veg broth. I also omitted the cayenne to the whole batch and only added some to my serving as I love the heat!  One can of black beans seemed to be more than enough for us....approx. 2 c. in a can. Served with Chicken Flautas on this site. Will make again! Thanks!

This recipe definitely needs tomatoes as others have suggested.  Also more spices if you like it spicy, it is very mild.  It is a quick and easy recipe for Beans and Rice.  Adding the beans cools it down so I will reheat next time after adding the beans, spices and tomatoes.  With the tomatoes it would be a 5 star recipe.

I made some changes just like everyone else, but loved the concept.  I wanted to make a recipe using black eyed peas for the new year.  I substituted turkey stock  for the broth, substituted black-eyed peas for the beans, and added chopped fresh tomatoes.  It was great.  Might add cheddar next time.

this was really good.We did substitute low sodium chicken broth for the vegetable broth though. I also added some hotsauce because I prefer spicier foods.

I was looking for a low cal/fat side dish...this is it. I used brown rice and chicken broth. I also shredded in a couple baby carrots and I had some leftover peas so I threw those in too! Delicious!

I liked this.  It was a little different and something we don't eat all the time.  It is a little bland, but nothing a little salt and hot sauce wont take care of.  I'm going to take the leftovers and use them in burritos tomorrow night.  Thanks for sharing, Robyn.

Definitely a great go-to recipe for black beans and rice.  Added a bit more spice (1/3 tsp) and garlic (3 cloves), but what else is new.

I saw the great rating for this and thought, what could be the big deal, but it is by far the simplest and tastiest version of black beans and rice that I have found yet...and I have tried a lot of recipes, most call for too many fancy ingredients. This is perfect and amazing! Added the corn at the end with the beans and it added a bit of sweetness to the mix, will definitely be making this again. Even my two year old loved it.

Makes a nice side dish. I used brown rice, chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, 1 sweet and 1 hot pepper sauteed, and I added a can of diced tomatoes. I cut way back on the cayenne pepper because of the addition of a hot pepper.

Excellent!  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, brown rice instead of white (it's better for you!), and didn't add the cumin because I didn't have any.  It ended up being very tasty, though I neglected to remember that brown rice takes longer to cook than white, and added the beans too early.  If you're going to make it with brown rice, add more broth and cook it about twice as long.  It turned out great though.  I don't understand why everyone is saying that it's too bland - a pinch of red pepper adds quite a kick!

Good base recipe. I definitely needed to add extra spices. I did change it up a bit with brown rice and chicken broth. I then added Siracha sauce to give it a little more "umph." I will make this again soon!

A great base recipe, I added it to my recipe book, but take it and run with it. Make it your own. Add a little more cayenne or some Thai hot sauce.

Very good, and I made it even easier! I used brown Ready Rice and just a touch of chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  It made this dish ready in about 5-8 minutes! I also added a couple tablespoons of tomato sauce, to make the rice taste more like Mexican-style rice.  I will make this again! I loved it.

The best beans and rice recipe I have tried yet.  We joke that we are on "the Dave Ramsey beans and rice diet" to get out of debt in this economy.  This recipe is a keeper, and a welcome change from boring beans and rice!  Thanks, Robyn.

This was just the recipe I was looking for! It's a simple, tasty, quick, recipe for black beans and rice. Honestly, I think all the changes people are making to this recipe are just preference. You should make this recipe as is, then decided what you'd like better...tomatoes, no tomatoes, chicken broth, beef broth...that's what makes it a great recipe, you can add or change ingredients to make it fit your family. Very yummy!

I don't eat alot of rice but I decided to make some jerk chicken and thought this would go great with it. It did! I added a can of stewed tomatos to it because other people suggested it and it turned out great! I will definately make this again!

Black beans and rice is one of my favorite combinations and this recipe proved to be a winner! I doubled up the cumin, and added some garlic powder and red pepper, only because I enjoy spices. Also, my rice was cooked and ready within 15 minutes. I enjoyed this recipe especially because of its healthy and a good source of fiber. I'll defintely make it again and again!

I've made this twice now. I add a can of petite diced tomatoes and use brown rice. It's so-so to me, but my husband absolutely loves it.

A little spicy for the family, but can adjust that in the recipe.  Other wise it was a hit.

4 stars as written, it's really a great base recipe.  As is, it's a little bland.  I added a can of corn, a can of diced green chiles, hot sauce, and extra spices that I had in my cabinet.  I bet adding tomatoes and cheese would be good as well.

Tailored this to my liking.  Added a small can of tomatoes with jalapenos, doubled the cumin, used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and tore up and added some fresh basil leaves toward end.  This is a GREAT rice recipe! Thanks Robyn!

I needed dinner quick and didn't have many options- but knew I had rice and beans in the pantry- I was distracted by my child and put the beans and spices in right after sauteing the rice- it didn't matter! I added an extra dollop of broth just in case, and everything turned out delicious. So easy and good. A few dashes of Tabasco and a little bit of sour cream made for a yummy dinner.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  The one change I make is that I usually add a 1/2 pound of cooked ground beef to give it a bit more substance.  Love it!

Very yummy! I added an extra garlic clove and diced fresh tomatoes on top at the end. It had just the right amount of onion and spices. I only had one 15 oz. can of beans and that was fine. Loved it!!

Good - but definately did not take 20 minutes to cook the rice! More like 45-50 minutes. and I needed ALOT more stock then it called for - at least 3 times the amount called for.

Wow, This was excellent w/ a few mior tweaks. I cut the cumin and red pepper in half and I added fresh cilantro and a few drops of freshly squeezed lime juice. I found it to be spicy enough and very flavorful. Oh, it did need some seasoned salt as well. It gets better if you let it sit for awhile before eating. I am sure leftovers will be even better.

I am in college with little cooking experience. I found it very easy and delicious! Although, after about 15 minutes the rice started to burn/stick to the bottom of the pot. So, I took it off and the rice was done. I also added an extra clove of garlic. and a little more cayenne pepper. But very very good, my roommate loved it too!

Wow - we loved this recipe.  I served it with carnitas tacos/guacamole. I made some changes as suggested by other reviews.
I used 5 large cloves garlic and 1 whole chopped poblano, 1 can chicken broth and sauteed with the onion and rice. Once the rice mixture was cooked, I used 1 can drained tomatos with green chiles, 2 t. cumin, 1/2 t. cayenne, 1 t. ea salt and pepper, 1/2 cup chopped cilantro and 1/2 cup raw chopped red onion.  It was outstanding and quite spicy, just how we California Girls like it!!
A dallop of sour cream on top tames the spiceness.  This is definately a keeper in our family!!

Absolutely delicious. I cooked two tomatoes separately in a little olive oil, added the beans and a little salt and when heated added to the rice mixture. Scrummy! :) :) :)

This recipe would have been perfect as written, but I made some changes based on my mood at the time and what I had on hand. First of all, I had some leftover brown rice in the fridge, so I omitted the broth and didn't cook the rice with the beans. Secondly, I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. Everything else was as written, and I served the beans over the rice with fried plantains on the side. The meal got great reviews!

Great recipe. I've made this twice now. The first time I pretty much stuck to the recipe (used brown rice instead of white) and it was good but not as flavorful as I wanted. The second time I used canned SPICY black beans instead of the regular ones, added the spices as stated in the recipe, and used brown basmati rice. This produced the perfect flavor!

This was delish!!!   I did make a few tweaks to the recipe so here's what I did:  I sauteed the rice, onion and garlic in butter.  Then I added chicken brother, a cube of cilantro boullian.  I am not sure how people aren't having cooked rice in 20 minutes.  That's pretty standard.  I did bring it to a boil first and then lowered the heat to a simmer and covered for 20 minutes on low.    Then I took my can of black beans and added one chopped jalapeno, tomatoes, squeezed lime juice, added tons more garlic powder, a dash of chipotle chili powder and Oila!! This was DELICIOUS!! Even my picky 5 year old ate like a piggy!

Yummy, although I too boosted the seasonings especially the garlic because I love it and added lemon juice as someone else suggested. It turned out good and I served it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I had sauteed in a separate batch of the same broth and seasonings it was awesome with a green salad as a side dish.

I loved this recipe and the kids gobbled it up. My husband thought it was ok. So for that reason, I did it a second time and added a few things. I added about half a jar of pineapple chipotle salsa (mild) to the initial recipe and put out a bunch of toppings (avocado, cheese, sour cream and cilantro) for my family to add as they choose. This seemed to make it all the better. You can also make this recipe with brown rice, but it will take longer to cook.

So yummy!!!! I added 1 can 14 oz of diced tomatoes and 3/4 c of the broth a splash of hot sauce and cilantro with brown rice. This was so much better then the box can't wait to make it again.

This is one of my staples now.  I leave off the rice to save calories, but it is still a personal favorite.  I use it as my afternoon snack at work.  It's extremely filling and has just the right amount of kick to get me through the end of the day.

This gets four stars because it's a great start for a lot of things and it was so darn easy. On its own, as other reviewers pointed out, it was pretty blah. I ended up adding a can of Rotel tomatoes to spice it up, served it with shredded cheese and sour cream. Very yummy. But I could see doing it with different types of beans and spices to make a wide variety of easy dishes, like using white beans and italian seasoned tomatoes.

This is really good.  Followed the recipe as it is.  Put pico de gallo on top with some lettuce and sour cream and it was so good.  My son likes it just plain.

Yum! I really like this recipe as is, though I do add extra cumin and skip the ceyanne pepper. I also really like it with some salsa thrown in. We've had this a couple times, and it's a good filling for tortillas with some cheese and sour cream.

This is a 5-star with some changes. I double the garlic and cumin, add lots of canned tomatoes, salt & pepper, and a pinch of ground red pepper. We use low-sodium chicken broth because we tend to have it on hand. We add chopped fresh cilantro at serving time (we love lots of it!). DH & I use hot chili paste and lime on ours; our kids like lime w/it too. Really a satisfying meal and one my whole family (even the picky eater!) loves. We make a double or triple serving, have it for dinner and pack it for lunch, and freeze it (w/o cilantro and lime) too! We use brown rice and dried beans, and it's just wonderful.

I tried this recipe once a few years ago, today i woke up thinking about it for some reason. Maybe because it was so yummy! As some others suggested I added a few things like tomatoes and peppers, but really, it is an excellent recipe, nice and simple, a great side dish or lunch. The first time I made it I actually just used left-over rice and added all the other ingredients to it and it was great.

This was a great side for Cinco de Mayo. I saw a few reviews saying it was too bland for their tastes, so I added red peppers to the onion mix, and frozen roasted corn, cilantro and lime juice at the end. It turned out great and I plan on making this again. A much healthier alternative to flavored rice from a box.

This is meant to be a plainer dish and it is fantastic! I add tomatoes and low fat sour cream to mine. My husband likes the cilantro cream cheese recipe from this site with his rice. We also add about 3/4 can of corn, nice for texture. Very good!

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I did alter it to become a 5 star recipe.  I used beef broth instead, as others suggested.  I cooked the rice/onion/garlic/beef broth in my rice pot, and then added the beans, spices, and some salsa to the rice.  It is delish!  I too served it with salsa chicken from this site and I was in heaven at dinner time!

I loved it! Makes a wonderful quick and easy side dish. I omitted half the oil and used a non-stick pan and spray to get the garlic and onions going. I also used chicken broth instead. Just make sure if you use powdered broth to taste it to make sure it's not too salty before adding. I also had to double the liquid amount to get the rice cooked.

Added a can of tomatoes w/ green chiles.  It was great.  Served it for dinner as a side dish to the Salsa Chicken on this website.  Used the leftovers for lunch the next day to make a burrito filling.  This recipe makes a large enough amount to do double duty.

Nice and easy, tastes good as well (if you like beans that is). It's probably better to use less beans (1 can worked fine for me). I also added some chic peas, not bad.

Just made this recipe for a low fat, healthy choice for my family.  I thought about adding some of the ingredients that others suggested (ie: red peppers, tomatoes) but just decided to make it how it was written subsituting chicken broth instead of vegtable.   It was soooo GOOD!  The flavor is great and the pepper ads just the right amount of kick to make it interesting!  My daughter is taking it to work tonight for dinner with a tortilla and very excited about it!

IT WAS TASTY, EASY, AND QUICK. I USED BROWN RICE THAT NEEDED TO BE COOKED LONGER, AND I ALSO ADDED VEGGIE SAUSAGE. NEXT TIME I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO ADDING A FEW MORE INGREDIENTS.

This is a very good base recipe but you are definitely going to want to spice it up to your tastes.  Why not use brown rice too?  You'll never notice the difference and you'll sneak in nutrients and fiber.

When I made this for dinner one night I added sauteed green peppers and threw in a can of diced tomatoes right at the end. The product was a delicious and colorful meal that we ate with a salad on the side.

I was looking for a basic beans and rice recipe like what I had when I lived in the Dominican Republic.  This was close - I added a red bell pepper with the onions, a few teaspoons of capers and some fresh cilantro at the end.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I use it all the time!  Sometimes I'll spice it up a little with salsa and make burritos, other times I just use it as a nice side dish.

This dish is very good! It has tons and flavor and it's very healthy! another idea: wrap the black beans and rice in a flour tortilla and add some tomatoes, you've got a wrap!

Super easy to make and delicious.  You can use chicken broth or bullion if you don't have vegetable.  I have made it with red beans when I was out of black beans and I think it's even better with red beans.  A hit.

This recipe is excellent. I dropped the cumin (only because there was none in the pantry) and added chili powder instead. Gave it a little more kick and will probably stick with it. Also added an extra clove of garlic just to make things interesting. I may try adding some tomatoes next time as well.

This was a quite tasty dish, and one that can be prepared in a minimum of time.  Great high protein veggy dish for athletes who don't have a lot of time after the workout.

I thought this was very tasty. I used all of the ingredients listed and added a little chopped jalapeno (just because we love the flavor). I did have to use closer to 2 cups of broth before my rice was cooked. I served this with an Achiote Citrus Chicken and the two paired well. I almost thought I was eating at my favorite Latin restaurant!

This was a great meal. The rice and beans were spicy and flavorful and made a great meatless dinner. I did substitute chicken broth for the vegetable broth. Even my mom loved it and she wants meat with every meal!

Yummy!  I didn't have any cayenne pepper, so I just added 5-6 dashes of Tobasco.  That and I used a low sodium chicken broth per others' suggestions.  It was very good!  Wrapped it up in a tortilla with some mozzarella and voila!  Dinner!  The hubby even liked it, and he claims to not be a fan of black beans!  ;-)

This was pretty good. I used brown rice not white--healthier. Could use more spices/veggies to turn it into more of a meal.

Fabulous and easy!  I cooked this up in about 20 minutes and served it in burrito-sized tortillas with some salsa and sour cream.  If it's served as a main dish, and you're hearty eaters (like us), it's more like five servings;  this recipe made five big burritos for us.

Easy and simple recipe. I used instant rice, cooked for less than 10 minutes (should have used less broth I think, cause it was a bit watery). Too bad it didn't use the beans liquid, I don't like waste, that's why I'm giving this 4 stars.

Fairly good - onions give some flavor and make it sweet.

Wonderful!! Very tasty and not mushy. I used chili powder in replace of the cayenne and cumin. I also sprinkled a little bit of cheddar on top of my bowl of rice. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!

A great, easy dish!  Though it is a slightly bland, it is a filling, flavorful and healthful meal when served on its own or in a tortilla, topped with plain yogurt or lowfat sour cream and/or colby jack or monterey jack cheese.

This is so quick and simple to make and still tastes wonderful.  I also like to use yellow rice instead of the white rice.

This was a great new recipe to try!  Low-fat, high-protein, high-fiber, high-iron.  And it tasted great!  Thing is, the dietary info is provided for just a 1/2-cup serving!  

I sauteed the onions & garlic in a bit of water instead of oil.

I didn't even try this on my kids.  I think they'd see all those beans & revolt!  It's a teeny bit spicy, too, for young ones.  That's ok ... more for me.

I loved this recipe!  I added cooked chicken and served with homemade guacamole and sour cream.  It was awesome.  My husband didn't care for it much.  It was a bit to "beany" for him.  I will definatly make it again for myself.  Thank you Robyn.

Yum - Yum!!! This dish goes great with just about any type of meat.  Matthew [my 3 year old son] loves to help me in the kitchen and this was so easy, he could have practically cooked it himself.  No complaints at this table!
