My wife and I both thought this was a great tasting recipe!  I didn't change the ingredients list, but did cook it a bit differently due to our schedule.  I cooked this on low for 3 hours and then turned off and came back hours later and turned it on high for 45 minutes with the added basil and didn't have any issues with dryness that was reported in another review.  Next time I'll add one more Thai chili pepper and also add the red bell pepper when I add the basil so they are a bit firmer.  Definitely will make again!

Meh.  The first time I try a recipe I follow it verbatim.  Maybe my new slow cooker cooks faster that it should, but 4 hours into the cooking process most of the liquid had cooked away.  At that point there was barely 2 servings, I had to add some chicken broth AND some diced potatoes just so there would be a meal for two people.  Way too much sodium!

I did make some changes,  I added one chopped onion, and 3 cloves of minced garlic,  and one can of coconut milk and also one tbsp of red curry paste. I didn't find this recipe that great, even though I added the extra ingredients. It was ok, but if you like extra spice, then it was a bit bland. I guess its not a thai curry, so that's why the recipe didn't call for coconut milk or curry paste.  I won't make it again.
