I scaled this way down for a family Sunday lunch with roast lamb, minted peas and baby leeks. The only thing I did differently was to add in some sweet potatoes and about 4 cloves of garlic. We loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this for a party.  I also included sweet potatoes, onions, and three different kinds of other potatoes.  I mixed everything in my large roaster, deleted the basil.  Portion everything into heavy duty foil, put in oven or over the campfire.  This is exceptional.

I rarely give out 5 stars for anything, but this one earned them! My mother made this recipe last year and loved it. She suggested I try it. I only tried a rutabaga once before and wasn't a huge fan, but in this recipe you'd never know it wasn't a potato.   Parboiling in advance makes this recipe super simple. Its easy to divide too, I made this for just my husband and I, so we didn't need 15 lbs of veggies. I used just 8 oz of each vegetable and estimated the rest of the ingredients. It turned out perfect.   I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

I scaled this back to 6 servings.  The only thing I did not like was the basil flavor with these veggies.  I will try this again, but maybe use some different spices to replace the basil.

Make double the amount of what you need for a meal.  Use half as a side dish.  Add leftovers and the rest of the roasted veggies to beef stew, cooked without root vegetables, for another meal.  Makes for a more flavorful beef stew -- with vegetables that haven't been cooked to death for hours.

Glass baking dish is WAY better than a metal dish. Just tried it both ways.

Delicious.  Didn't have rutabaga but had everything else; added potatoes.  Per Linda-da's suggestion, used a glass baking dish but usually do so anyway.  I might add some onion next time and instead of basil would consider a bit of Rosemary.  One thing's for sure, I'll do the root veggies the same way again.  Excellent idea.

Never realized the importance of precooking them. You can easily adjust this recipe - quantity & type of root vegetables.

I added beets, sweet potatoes, white potatoes and onion.  I parboiled the rutabagas separately with salt and vinegar (can use lemon as well) to get rid of the bitter taste they sometimes have-rinse thoroughly afterwards.  I parboiled the beets with the carrots.  Did the potatoes separately.  Did not parboil the onion.  Followed the rest of the recipe and it was quite good!  Will definitely make again.

I also scaled  this way back. I also switched out the vegetable oil for olive oil because it's 2014 and nobody should still be consuming or ingesting  vegetable oil! But the mixture of vegetables used was awesome and very flavorful! My kids didn't even know they were eating parsnips. Will be making this a regular dish!!!

I followed the directions exactly and it was fabulous.  Next time I will add more salt.  Also, the peeling takes awhile if you don't have help.  I thought the basil tasted great with the combination of vegetables!

Never tried rutabaga or parsnips but I felt adventurous. Don't regret trying this recipe but I will definitely reduce amount next time (about 2/5ths should be fine for a typical family meal).

My hubby and I were unsure ahead of time if we would like the rutabagas and parsnips since we hadn't had them since we were kids.  However, these are wonderful.  Because there are just the two of us, this is easy to make and freeze for later meals.

Did up carrots, parsnips, onions and garlic buds in the Actifry with 1 tbsp olive oil, the basil and black pepper for two people.  Excellent with the Slow Cooker German Shortribs!

I made this for our family Christmas dinner and it was well received (well as well as can be given it was not "the tradition") but I had to change it up to meet with the preferences of the group, and the veg group needed.  I used organic carrots and potatoes (red, russet, blue and sweet) and oven fried them while the turkey rested.  They were really yummy.  They took longer than 30 minutes to get good color, even with a gas oven, (maybe because the potatoes have less sugar)  but it was a great change up for an elegant dinner.  Thanks and I will use this again.

Love it!!
Made it yesterday for Thanksgiving dinner (I have about 25-30 people for the Holiday) and it was a huge hit. Even my husband who scoffed at the idea of having this loved it an made sure that I saved the recipe, not only on my app but also in my recipe box. 
I kept it all the same...no alterations. 
Will gladly and definitely make again.

The seasoning didn't real do anything for this dish. It was a little bland so I had to add my own spicy sweet chili sauce. Also the portion sizes are way to big. I cute everything down by 1/5

I scaled this back as well. I used a Tuscan olive oil and a little balsamic vinegar. Next time, I plan to use the maple balsamic vinegar instead. Great way to use the veggies from my fall farm share.
