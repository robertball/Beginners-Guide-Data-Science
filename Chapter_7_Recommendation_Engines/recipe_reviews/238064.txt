I submitted this recipe, and I do not melt the peanut butter. I  purposely didn't melt it because I don't see the point. Also, I double the peanut butter (discovered this after submission and couldn't change it). Enjoy

It came out a little bland.  If I were to make it again, I would add more cinnamon or another spice to make it more flavorful.

I also used PB2 in addition and omitted the cinnamon.  This very easy to make.

Bland, needs salt. Add dried fruit after cooking so they don't dry out.

Very quick and easy granola, I like the fact that it is low fat. Even though it is tasty.

I was looking for a good recipe that I could make my own for our next episode, and this was a perfect base! I added a pinch of sugar, replaced the raisins for semisweet chocolate chips, and about 1/4 of a cup marshmallow cream. Then I made a ganache or frosting mixture on the stove that I didn't measure but used cocoa powder, peanut butter, some salt (barley!) and some more marshmallow creme, adding milk as needed to thin it out. Putting it on top, it was excellent! I would say that you might want to add salt to the granola because it was a tiny bit sweet. All in all, a great recipe base.
