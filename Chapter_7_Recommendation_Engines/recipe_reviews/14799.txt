I did this dip for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit! However, after reading the reviews, I went ahead and made some changes in order to make sure the dip came out perfect. I doubled all the ingredients, except for the Parm cheese topping.  I added 1 C. Mayo, and 1 C. Sour Cream, blended them all well. Cover and bake 350F for 30 minutes. I removed the cover and let it bake an additional 15 minutes.  I made up a bread bowl by using a pumpernickel bread, cut the top, hollow out the inside. Scoop the dip into the bowl, and I served with Crackers and nacho chips. The consistency was just right. It was a hit at the party, I'm asked to make it again for Christmas.

I loved this recipe, though I took other's advice and added 3/4 block of fat free cream cheese, two cloves of garlic, and a bit of colby jack shredded cheese. All of that made it a little richer, creamier, not so dry, and more flavorful. It was an absolute hit, and great rewarmed the next day for dinner (what little was left). The only thing..it took nearly twice as long to bake as the original recipe states.

I make a variation of this recipe all the time and people love it.  Try this - use 18oz of artichokes rather than 14, add 1c. mayo, and use 1 c. parm along with the other ingredients listed.  Mix it all up and bake it covered at 325 for 30 minutes.  Then uncover and bake until light brown.  It will be creamy and delicious.  Enjoy!

This recipe is great BUT I would suggest two things.  One, use creamed spinach instead of plain and serve in a stoneware dish so that it stays hot longer.  I also serve this with tortilla chips and not bread and it is much better.  This dip is best hot- so keep your oven on and keep popping it back in.

Disclaimer: not suitable for chips. yes it's thick and tastes like spinach and artichokes

That said, this dip is amazing. Use creamed spinach, add a couple cloves of garlic and serve in a hollowed out round of french bread with bread cubes for dipping. magnificent.

This dip was ok.  I didn't love it.  I'm not a big fan of spinach and I felt the flavor of the spinach came through too much.  My family seemed to enjoy it.  I used rye bread toast rounds as a "dipper."  I don't think I'll make this again.

I had lost this recipe and was so happy to find it again.  My suggestions: roast a whole clove of garlic with olive oil and add it right in.  I also like to add about 3 or 4 ounces of cream cheese.

I thought this recipe was great just the way it is.  (I noticed a lot of reviews saying to add cream cheese, garlic, onion, etc.?)  It IS best served hot, but this dip went so fast with my family, it never had a chance to get cold!  Very good.  Try it!

I read the reviews before cooking, so I added a little half and half and a little skim milk to try to make it a little more creamy.  I appreciate the recipes for this dish with no mayo, cream cheese or sour cream, and found this one to be tasty and a hit with my family.  I also added some red pepper to spice it up.  It is indeed best when very warm, reheated just fine, and I advise using a spoon to dish onto your chip or pita, as it is pretty thick.  Thanks for the recipe!

If your looking for a creamy warm spinach artichoke dip. . . keep looking. This version is to dry and the amount of spinach called for is too much for most tastes

I am very disappointed with this recipe. It does taste good but not creamy at all. I wish I would've read the reviews before I made it. Unfortunately I'm snowed in and couldn't make it again using another recipe. I feel bad for my guests who had their heart set on this

The flavour was there but the dip was too chunky and not easy to pick up or spread.  I'll go back to my creamier version.

This was pretty good and easy to put together. I like that you do not need to load up on the mayo.  I did add a sprinkle of garlic powder and that was it.  Oh, I forgot to add the parm cheese on top, but it was still really good.  You will need to reheat it when it sits out.  Just about 15 seconds in the microwave and then it will be goey and dip-able...

True, this is not a sour-creamy dip with preservative-laced mayo.  This is a more authentic, natural recipe that reminds me of a local restaurant favorite that I've been trying to replicate for years.  I added quite a bit more lemon juice, along with some Italian seasoning and kosher salt.  You'll need a fork to pile this on your chips (it's also great with crostini), but who cares!  Note: I did not drain/squeeze my spinach.  I also added a little more shredded mozzarella over top.

I like that it doesn't have mayo in it. I used whole spinach because I didn't have the frozen chopped kind, but then I put it in the blender and it turned out the perfect consistency.

Just made this recipe exactly as it's written and it's awful. Yikes... now I'm going to try and salvage it by adding some cream cheese or something to it and throwing it back in the oven. It's all spinach and artichoke and not creamy at all (I was looking for the texture that restaraunts serve).

This recipe was just too "spinachy" for me (even after adding 1/2 C mayo and 1/2 C sour cream.  Will make again, but will go 1 C mayo and 1 C sour cream (as well as clove ove minced garlic).  Thanks for the base recipe however!

Follow CookinGheri's advice and make it just like she suggests, and you'll have a dip to die for!!  I've made this twice in four days, and added a couple of variations...I eliminated the lemon juice, and changed the mozzarella from 1 cup mozzarella to 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 cup monterrey jack.

I thought that they way this recipe was written would have turned out very, very dry. I added sour cream and mayonnaise, and more cheese, as well as some garlic, and it turned out fantastic. I also made sourdough crostini and it was a huge hit! It's great if you add sour cream and mayo but too dry and not enough flavor otherwise!

This dip is supposed to be creamy and cheesy. There are no ingredients that help to make this dish creamy. I ended up with spinach and cheese for a dip. It's missing cream cheese or something similar. I wouldn't suggest this at all.

I have been making this for about 10 years.  I use a cup of Mayo (light) with 1 cup of swiss and 1/2 to 1 cup Parmesan. Top it with finely diced tomatoes and green onions. Delicious.  My 3 nieces eat a batch of this by themselves.

I made the mistake of not reading any reviews prior to this, as I was in a hurry. This really isn't a dip at all. When prepared to specifications, it is incredibly thick, and really difficult to spoon out. Very spinach-y. My boyfriend seemed to like it, but thought it was a side dish. I would definitely follow some of the advice in other reviews on things to add, like the sour cream. Which pretty much makes it a different recipe. I wouldn't make it this way again.

Although I added a few hints of my own, I did enjoy the recipe!  The only alterations I made was adding the low-fat cream cheese because of another review I read (because I too dont much care for dry dip, and I like to spread it easily on french bread), and I also added Garlic gloves and some garlic powder, and used a little less of the Parm cheese.  Over-all I great app!  It was easy to make and not at all expensive to prepare and tastes like a restaurant!  Thanks - Chelle

This was good, once I followed the other reviews and added a block of cream cheese.  I also added some Tobasco sauce to give it a little kick, and some garlic cloves.  After that, it was great, and I liked on bread and tortilla chips.  It's wonderful topped with chopped tomato too.

I agree with the review from CookinGheri. By adding the mayo,cream cheese & doubling the recipe makes this recipe more rich. The only thing I didn't like was placing it in the Pumpernickel bread bowl. The dip got cold really quick and wasn't very good. Thanks god I left some in the baking dish. This recipe MUST be served hot. Finally warm up your Nacho/Scoops/Tortillas if you can.Good Eats:)

Wish I had read the reviews more closely.  This does not remotely resemble a dip.  Much too dry. Followed the recipe closely but used less parmesan cheese and part skim milk mozzarella.  Can't believe this slight deviation would have caused the dryness.  I really wonder if some ingredient is not missing from this recipe - like milk or sour cream or mayo or ????  In any case - will not be making this again.

This is an awesome recipe! I make a very similar one, but add a splash of Worshchestire sauce to it and a blend of asiago and romano cheese.  It's such a crowd pleaser!

**UPDATED** I need to add that I make this with light mayo, light sour cream and light cream cheese. That should help with the "dryness" some are experiencing.  I made this dip for our family Christmas Eve appetizer buffet last year. My little brother (who is 17) could not stop eating it! He even asked my mom to buy the ingredients at the grocery store so he could make it for himself at home over his winter break! I have prepared this recipe several times since then for family events and work functions. There is never a drop left over! It's so easy to prepare in a pan on the stove, then transfer to my crock pot for travel. Thanks for sharing!

This was the best recipe yet!  I did add about 1/4 cup of mayo, just to make it a bit moist, since it was a little dry.  I put all of the parm cheese in the dip and topped with mozz.  I sliced petite sourdough bread and toasted in the oven for a perfect combonation with the dip.

This dip is AWESOME!  My husband at half of the recipe for dinner.  We both love the fact that this dip is thick and not some runny goop like at Bennigan's.  I used regular frozen spinach and squeezed out the water and added a couple of cloves of garlic and sprinkled some extra pepper over the top.  I also threw on some diced tomatoes on the top before serving.  This is great with toasted rounds of a good French baguette.  I will definetely make this again and again!

This is the best recipe I have found for this appetizer. It's great for a cold night
party where hot appetizers are needed to warm up your guests. Although if this
is your first time making this appetizer, after you taste it, it may not make it to 
your guest's, it's that good!

Use Creamed Spinach and add some garlic to give this dip some more zest.  Also, you have to cook it at least 30 min. until the cheese starts bubbling.  Make sure the center is fully cooked.  It's really good!!!

Mine did not taste like spinach at all. Remember to use the CREME spinach. Mine was mellow and the Mazzarella cheese really smoothed out the flavor. I put the artichoke hearts in a blender for a quick second to puree a little bit more than chopped. My party loved it and I will make it again....definitely!

This is a fabulous recipe!! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added some colby jack, cream cheese, & mayo. I served it with pita chips & focaccia sticks. I made this on Thanksgiving as an appetizer to tide everybody over until dinner. My husband isn't a big fan of artichokes but this turned out to be his favorite dish of the day! We'll be making this many more times.

Just as good as the restaurant-style, but I add more garlic to personalize it. Keep it warm!

I gave this a 4 after I added to it.  I added about 3/4 cup of Mayo and Johnny's garlic and herb seasonings.  It was great.  The mayo helped it not to be so dry.

Wasn't great. Don't make again.

Flavor was ok. The dip was way too dry & salty.  Once it started to cool, it was way to hard to dip.  People at my party had a hard time eating it. I had to throw it away.

This was pretty tasty, but I think either I used the wrong type of artichokes or it didn't appeal as strongly as I would have liked. It's worth doing again as it had some good flavor! Thanks for sharing!

Hi- just wanted to let you know, the spinach and artichoke dip was a disapointment. I thought it would have been creamy. I  have had this recipe at Boston Pizza an it is to die for. Patti

I will have to agree with some of the other reviews, this was a bit dry. I usually read the reveiws beforehand to get various ideas from other cooks, but of course this time I did not.If I make this again, I will definitely take suggestions from the other reviews and add ingredients to make this creamy.

My guests seemed to like the taste, but it wasnt really "dippy" it was kinda thick and dry.  I didnt really like it myself.  Wonder if a package of cream cheese would do the trick?

I guess I like a more creamy dip.  I served it immediately out of the oven & it was impossible to "dip", you had to use a spoon.  It was so bad I took it off of the serving table.

This was a GREAT recipe, something different from the creamy spinach/artichoke dips...I don't understand why people expect it to be creamy (from reading the other reviews I assume some people think that without mayo, sour cream, alfredo sauce, or any of the other thousand ingredients that can make this creamy it will be).  Awesome and easy to make!

I made this recipe for a super bowl party and it came out horribly.  I made the bowl ahead of time and heated it up at the party.  The cheese stuck together and made it impossible to dip in to.  People started giving up and spooning into it.

This recipe was very easy to put together. I found it very tasty, everyone enjoyed it. Next time I will add maybe Half & Half or mayonaise to give it a little more of a creamy texture.
*******
The 2nd time I made this, I added sour cream to the mixer. Came out great! Have to make this recipe every "Game Night". I also changed my rating from a 4 star to a 5 star.

I was hoping to use this to encourage my son and husband to eat spinach without realising they were eating spinach.  No way!  This was horrible.  No creaminess, couldn't dip chips at all.  Skip this recipe!

This is good...but not as good as the restaurant dip.  I added a block of cream cheese to make it smooth and you must serve this dip right after cooking because it is terrible when it gets cold!

I felt it was too strong on artichoke flavor and I put in less than a full can. Love artichokes but they overpowered here.

This is great. Followed recipe but omitted the Lemon Juice and added minced Garlic ( 2 cloves, husband and I Love Garlic) and 1 block of Cream Cheese. Next time I might add heavy cream. This Absolutely wowed the crowd.

I made this recipe without modifications. The flavor was very nice, but the consistency was much too thick. I will be adding a base of cream cheese, sour cream, and mayo in order to make it more "chip-friendly".

The flavor is very good but it does not come out to be as creamy as we expected.  The cheese gets to be too stringy.

LOVED THIS! I agree, it was much better leftover & reheated.  I added gouda when I reheated it because if SOME cheese is good, then MORE cheese is always better ;)  Oh SO easy, cheesy and yummy! Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

This is NOTHING like the traditional creamy spinach dips or ranch dips- so if that is what you want, move on to another recipe.  But if you want something very savory: this is a Great appetizer! Very tasty with fresh broccoli, zucchini sticks and other fresh veggies.  Got raves from my Thanksgiving guests.  I did add 1/2 package of cream cheese after reading all the complaints about not being creamy.  I did not drain the spinach.  It was a bit thick for my blender, but it made it.  I will definitely make this again.

I was disappointed because it was dry and went back to read the recipe again.  Did the writer mean that we should have utilized the liquid the spinach was in?  That would have made it much creamier.  It didn't say to drain the spinach.  So I will assume that's what it was meant to be.

This is the best dip ever!!  I really detest the mayonaise type spinach dips.  This one tastes just as good as ones from restaurants.  The trick is to eat it while hot.  My husband and I spread this dip on toasted coins of french baguettes and yum!!

This recipe was not at all what I expected.  I never use frozen spinach which should have been my first tip!  This dip was not at all creamy and the taste of frozen spinach was overwhelming.  I served it with fried pita chips and the chips were the only part we enjoyed!  I guess my preference is for the creamy version and I will know for next time to use fresh spinach in my dips!

My bff and I had a huge H.S. graduation party for our respective children this weekend. This dip was eaten up very quickly. I did make it a bit creamier by making a roux and then adding fat free half and half and stirred until thickened. From there I placed the vegies and all of the cheeses in the same sauce pan except that I subbed brie for the mozarella. I also added a pound of fresh lump crab meat just to make it a little fancier. Thanks so much Kathy!

I absolutely hate cream cheese and mayo, so this dip was awesome. People always ask me to make it whenever I am invited for dinner.  It was chunky, great as a bread dip.  Finally, a spinach/artichoke dip without cream cheese or may that is very delicious!

This is a quick and impressive appetizer.  It tastes quite a bit like the one served at the Olive Garden.  I did make one change, though.  I didn't have the white pepper or the lemon juice, but I did have some lemon pepper.  I used that instead.

I made this dip for my Superbowl party and it was a big hit.  The only thing is, it needs to be hot to be at it's best taste.  We had to microwave it a couple of times but it got rave reviews from my guests.

Much drier than expected.  Similar dips in restaurants are very creamy and cheesy.I made it at the last minute to bring to a party and was very disappointed.  The next day, I added cream cheese, more mozzarella, milk, additional seasonings, and cream of mushroom soup, and served over bowtie pasta and it was much better. Perhaps the suggestion to use creamed spinach would work better, but something else is needed to enhance the cheesy texture.  Definitely needs improvement.

I was thoroughly disappointed in this dip. It was so dry and thick, the chips kept breaking off in the dip. I had to cook it double the amount of time the recipe said.

I tried this dip but after reading several reviews about it being bland, I substituted Moterary Jack cheese for the Mozzerella (a bit more hearty) and also added 1/2 cup of Mayo (I actually used Miracle Whip Light) and it really turned out great! Lots of flavor!  I served it with bar chips rather than tortilla chips for something different.  Lisa

I tried this because of the great reviews but I was terribly disappointed.  The cheese was sparse and lumpy, not creamy.  The taste was average, not exceptional.  This could possibly be used as a "base recipe" but it definitely needs improvement.

This recipe was one of the worst ones I have gotten off this site.  It was bland, had relatively no flavor or texture.  The spinach taste was overwhelming.  When cooked, the cheese was melted but, it didn't spread easily.  I would not recommend this dish to anyone.  I was emabarrased that I had brought this to the gathering that I attended.  Do NOT try this dish.

I loved this recipe.  It was the first thing eaten at my Super Bowl party.  I have made it since then with the same great reviews.  Be sure to use the creamed spinach.  I also used real parmesan cheese.

We tried this dip for our Oscar party, and were disappointed.  It had a very strong spinache taste, and lacked zing.
