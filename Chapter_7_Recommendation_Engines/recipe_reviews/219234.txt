Personally, this was bland and did not have nearly enough pasta or cheese. I tried to 'fix' it after tasting, and next time will just start from scratch. I use hunts often, but find their flavored tomato products mildly flavored.

This is a quick and easy recipe, and we enjoyed it very much, although I doctored it up a bit. Instead of the basil diced tomatoes, I used petite diced tomatoes and added one tablespoon each of Pampered Chef Italian seasoning and of brown sugar.
