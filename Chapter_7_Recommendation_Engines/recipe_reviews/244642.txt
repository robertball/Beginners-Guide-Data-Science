This recipe is WILD. My housemates and I wanted to make cookies but got something much more unique than that. These are not cookies–let's make that clear–but these scone-like concoctions are addictive. They're a house favorite for sure.

These definitely cook up more like shortbread, but are easy and tasty.

I halved the recipe, went up to a full 1/2 cup on the sugar, added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and loved it!

If you use the peanut butter cookie process of using a fork to make a crisscross on top, they flatten beautifully.

It was very doughy, I think there was too much flour. I rolled the dough into balls and placed them on the sheet and when I pulled them out, they were still in balls and the bottoms were burnt. I think maybe add less four and more brown sugar with vanilla extract.

I changed the recipe and instead of 2 eggs, did 1 banana (not too ripe but still softish). I also added some vanilla extract because some reviewers said the recipe might taste bland. Everything else I followed exactly and this is how they turned out! They were delicious!! ** I also put the dough in the freezer for about 5 minutes before baking**

The rating for the recipe is  a 2..
For the add-ons I placed it made it a 4...

Note these cookies don't leave the shape of how you made them!!!  

So the recipe is dry and bland. I doubled the batch and added another cup of sugar as well as 2 tps of vanilla extract. I set aside my left over chocolate chips and melted them. Once the cookies where done I ended up dunking the cookies into the chocolate completely coating them and setting them solidify again.   It most definitely saved the cookie from it's blandess and also gave it a delicious taste. Heck of a recovery.

The spooning onto the baking sheet part meant they came out ugly, so next time I'll try rolling them. My son devoured two before they'd even fully cooled so I'm guessing that means they turned out okay other than the shape.

I don't agree that this recipe makes a tasteless cookie!  It is  simple and not over-sweet, which I like because it highlights the chocolate chips---or any other add you want to make. This is a basic recipe---so you can embellish it anyway you like..add more sugar, use really dark sugar instead of brown sugar, add vanilla or nuts or coconut or cherries...the dough's simplicity will make the star of the show what you add, rather then over powering the fruit or nuts or whatever.

Otherwise they are great!

IF I COULD GET AWAY WITHOUT ANY STARS IT WOULDN'T HAVE ANY.....

This recipe sucks I know what to call these things it made but they sure ain't no chocolate chip cookies and are so gross even after trying to doctor the recipe they still won't come out like a chocolate chip cookie is suppose to. Uckkkk 
Is there any that do you out right that are pretty basic and quick without all the usual ingredients?

Good emergency cookie-
This is an easy recipe to memorize so you don't always have to pull out a book or look up a site.
This is a base recipe- a basic 5 ingredient cookie. Something to make when you are in a hurry or when you don't want to stop at the store. You can always add to it.
They will be crunchy, like the boxed type.
I recommend a pinch of salt and cap-full of vanilla.

*I will also add, you need good ingredients when there are so few. The cheap flour won't taste good. I use organic white spelt. 

Fast and easy! Thank you.

5 stars for fast, simple/easy, and a great base/leaves room to get creative. I use all organic ingredients. Know that the cookies don't flatten out at all. Also, I love dunking my cookies and these were perfect for that. You can substitute anything you want in them, too. I always add tooons of chocolate (I just chop up a dark choc bar), my husband likes peanut butter cups, my grandma likes walnuts, raisins, and spice.

Mine turned out really dry and somewhat tasteless.  I have much better recipes that I can use.  Thanks but will pass on making this one again.

Super easy and delicious. Of course, I added a bit of cinnamon/nutmeg to spice things up

Seemed like the recipe was missing something. There wasn't much flavour to the cookie and it was a little crunchy. But they were okay...

This was an okay recipe.  Very easy to make with a few ingredients that are usually on hand. I felt they lacked the flavor that most chocolate chip cookies have.  Without a leavening agent they were only as thick as you make them; they were kind of dense.  Overall, these wouldn't be at the top of my list, but were quick and easy enough that I would use them again in a pinch.
