These are not latkes. They are called chremslech. The difference is simple: latkes are always made with raw potatoes, chremslach with boiled potatoes. All that aside, the chremslech are better yet if you brown the onions prior to adding to mashed mixture. Use lots of ground pepper as a seasoning. You can also add a crushed garlic clove to the oil and remove it before it browns too much.

I have just tried this recipe for latkes, it is wonderful.   The only difference for me is to shred the potatoes and not cook them first.

I also add a couple of cloves of garlic to the mix.

We LOVED this recipe.  It was delicious.  The latkes were fluffy, tasty and easy to make.  This has become a Hanukkah staple in our house.

Wish I could give it 10 stars...they reminded me of the kind my Bobie use to make from scratch when I was a kid.  I live in an area where I can't buy the "box" mix for potato latkes (which is what I usually do if my kids come to visit and bring them to me) and have been looking for a good recipe.  This is it.  I did change one thing though.  I used Idaho potatoes and didn't shred any Yukon’s.  Just used all the Idaho’s and mashed them up after I boiled them...so, so, good!!!

These were great.  I spent lots of time last Chanukkah (our first observance of the festival) looking through latke recipes.  The matzah meal really makes the difference.  These went very quickly at home and at oneg.

My husband is Jewish and I am Italian. He was so impressed with these latkes and feels they were the best he has ever tasted in all of his year eating latkes! Quick and easy, especially with the food processor.

The latkes were tasty & will be my new favorite Hannuka recipe. They even freeze quite well, without too much loss in flavor!

Mine did not turn out light and fluffy. And the taste wasn't that great either. I was disappointed. I t could have been the recipe or the cook...i don't know...try 4 yourself.

I added 2 cloves of garlic and substituted crushed crackers and some flower for the matzo meal. These both worked great!

Delicious latkes!  The matzo meal is key; I made my own from some stale leftover matzos (just by grinding it up with a mortar and pestle into a rough flour-like consistency);I also added about 2 additional tbsps of matzo, bringing the total to 5 tbsps matzo.  Additionally, I added a few dashes of ground pepper and fried them in unsalted butter.  Light and crispy.  Best latkes I've ever had (my husband agrees).

These were delicious!  My mother is visiting & had a hankering for latkes when we were in Germany but we couldn't find any there.  I tried these at home & she loved them!  I live in Russia & could not find matzo meal but bread crumbs worked perfectly fine.  There were only three of us eating & I was afraid I'd made way too many (I just used all the potatoes we had in our home) but they were all instantly gone!  Thank you very much for this recipe.

I am not Jewish, however we have made these "Potato Pancakes" for years out of leftover mashed potatoes. Instead of matzo meal we use all purpose flour and they turn out great.

I don't know what these are, but they're not potato Latkes. What ever they are we did not enjoy them.
