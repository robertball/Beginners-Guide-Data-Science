THE.BEST.PIE.EVER.
I've made both the original recipe and this healthier version, and for my taste, this one wins the contest. I can't imagine anyone rating these pies less than 5 stars. You just can't mess them up. Thank you Grandma Ople!!
One alteration that made it a tad healthier, still, is I made a whole wheat pie crust. (Recipe: 3/4cup butter, softened; 1/3cup water; 1/4 tsp salt; 1/2 tsp sugar; 1 cup whole wheat flour; 1 cup white flour. It's meant to be 2 crusts, but I squeeze 3 out of it. Roll between 2 sheets of wax paper. Super easy.)

Easy pie with great results.  My teenage daughter made the sauce, and with pre-made pie crust and Granny Smith apples it made a wonderful pie.  We took the liberty of putting a 1/4 tsp. cinnamon in the sauce because we are all fond of a touch of cinnamon in our cooked apples.  Everyone loved it with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Just right!

To make it even more healthy, I eliminated the white processed sugar and replaced it with raw unfiltered honey and a tiny bit of organic molasses. I also made my own crust with almond meal and coconut oil and replaced the white processed flour with organic coconut flour. Much more healthy and you'd never know the difference!

This is the first time I ever made a pie.  I look for recipes with a few ingredients and simple directions; this fit the criteria, so I gave it a try.  It was great tasting.  My husband, a pie lover, said it was great.  I was able to use only one pie crust as my recipe for crusts was ample enough to use the scraps and reform them to apply the lattice strips.

I did something wrong - my butter, flour , sugar, water, went fairly solid - more like a paste - I couldn't pour it - had to pack it over 
top of apples. Sure hope it works.... Did I let it heat too long on the stove???

This was my first attempt at baking an apple pie. Although mine did not come out looking as nice as the one in the photo (I had to make pie crust from scratch for the first time so you can imagine...lol). Overall, the taste was amazing. It had a slight lemony taste (which I loved) even though I did not add any lemon. I am guessing it was the apples. I think the brown sugar made a world of difference and it made me feel a little less guilty...:p I will be making another pie soon.

I made this pie yesterday and found it to be absolutely wonderful!  I made no changes to the recipe, followed it to the letter.  I can't wait to have another slice with whipped cream after supper tonight.  Thanks for posting this recipe!  It's a WINNER!

The mixture to pour onto the crust didnt cover the entire tip. Next time I will coat the apples with it before laying down the crust.

This is the only way I make apple pie now! I pile the apples high and pour the sauce before it becomes a paste so it spreads evenly over all the apples. My family loves it.

Fantastic! I have made the original recipe and loved it,  but this version is just as delicious and saves you 100 calories per slice! Yay! I do however add cinnamon and nutmeg. To me, those flavors are the epitome of apple pie, so they are never left out. I simply mix 1 teaspoon of cinnamon with some freshly grated nutmeg, sprinkle on the apples and toss to coat, then add to the pie dish and proceed with the recipe from there. Raves every time!! :)

I've tried Grandma Ople's original and now this. The original gets five stars, this....not even close. I'm not sure why it made a difference but for some reason the butter, brown sugar, and flour separated and wouldn't "pour" but rather clumped out of the pan. It's pie- it's not meant to be super healthy, adjusting it just doesn't work sometimes.

I like the way this recipe makes eating apply pie less 'sinful', less sweet. The flavour is perfect (with an addition of cinnamon as suggested by a reviewer). But the use of raw apples when baking seemed to create mushy, soggy content when cooked, that resulted in undercooked bottom of the pie. Next time I will try to half boil the apples first before placing them in the pie.

My butter/flour/sugar/water mixture went solid. I'm not sure why. It was fairly paste-like from the beginning, when it was just flour and butter, and just never got better. I was a bit distracted at the beginning, so the flour/butter cooked a little long just on their own; maybe they got too hot? Also, I used salted butter; I know salt makes water boil faster, maybe it somehow affected this mixture too? I tried simmering it for a really long time hoping that maybe at some point it would liquefy, but no luck, so don't bother trying that if this happens to you. Anyway, I had used a mix of Golden Delicious and Gala apples, and I'd already put the lattice crust on, so I just glopped the caramel stuff on top. It didn't melt and drip down into the pie as I'd hoped, it just stayed on top. When the pie was done cooking, I carefully tipped it to the side and drained off the apple juice (since the caramel didn't go down into the pie, there was nothing to help the juice set up and be anything but watery). The pie cooled overnight and was delicious the next morning (my 4-year-old wanted apple pie for his birthday breakfast). You have to choose your bites carefully, but as long as a bit of the caramel top is in each bite, you're fine.

I just made this version of Grandma Oples Pie.... I think there is definitely a mistake in the amount of flour in the recipe for the sauce. This version calls for 3 T of flour and half the butter as the original. It did turn into a paste. I think the flour needs to be cut back so that the sauce will pour. I will try it again because I think it will be as good or better than the original if the  sauce becomes "pourable".

Very simple to make and turned out so good. I had too many apples or maybe the apples I used were too big but it came out great. I will be making this again.

Very nice!! I had Gala I needed to use up, but I'm sure Granny Smith would have been at least as good. I used some almond milk in my syrup, and just kept adding until it was a nice syrupy consistency. Also added spices (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger and cardamon) to the syrup with the flour. We felt we could have added greater amounts of our spices, but overall the sweetness was plenty and taste was good. Also mixed the apple in with the syrup before placing in crust (which was store bought). Would love to try this recipe again, experimenting more with the spices!

I wanted an apple pie recipe to try out cooking apples from my tree.  I am not much of a baker and I wanted something that did not have tons of sugar.  I used premade pie shells, because I had them on hand and did not want to put to much time into a baking recipe that might flop .  I filled the one shell with the apples and used the other to make the lattice.  I used salted butter because that is what I had on hand.  Followed the recipe otherwise.  I was ready for disappointment when it came to the taste test.  One because I was not sure about the apples and Two, because of the recipe.  I WAS ELATED AT THE RESULTS!  I want to make it again today!!!!  Thank you!  I used Haralred apples(a tart cooking apple from my tree).  I was not sure about sauce as far as cooking.  I simmered till it started to thicken but not stiff.  I thought about mixing the apples in the sauce then putting them in the pie shells but was very happy I stuck to the instructions of pouring it over the lattice.

Great flavor, but not that much different than any other recipe I've used for apple pie.  I did like the "healthier" option, and the taste does not indicate that healthy aspect.

This is very good as written. Next time though I will add cinnamon, just because I'm a fan. After turning down the oven I baked it for another 60 minutes to make sure the bottom crust was fully baked.

I've been making apple pies my whole life, I went to 'healthy apple pie recipes ' for a change after my sister went apple picking and I had a bushel of fresh apples. This is absolutely the best apple pie I've ever made and I dare say the best we've ever had!  it was different in preparation and I was skeptic but only made one pie to try and I'm definitely using this recipe every time!!! We loved it, thank you Gramma Ople!  P.S. I did add cinnamon on the apples but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It's perfect!

This was just Okay. I mixed the apples into the mixture before placing in pie. (tried pouring over crust in original recipe and i didnt like it) Tasted the apples and it needed something..added 2 Teas of cinnamon and 1/2 teasp of nutmeg. Did a simple egg wash on top and baked for time directed. The sweetness level was good, although even after several  hours its a bit on the runny side.

No changes. A great recipe for  flavorful apple pie! Never mind the calories. If you want a low-calorie dessert, you make a zucchini sorbet. A low-calorie apple pie is analogous to a low-cost Lamborghini.
