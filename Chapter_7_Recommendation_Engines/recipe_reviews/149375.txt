This is a great recipe to prepare in advance for a breakfast you can eat on the run. I tried my own version by replacing four of the whole eggs with egg whites, and replaced the ham with turkey bacon. I omitted the cilantro and added parsley and onion.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful--very easy and very tasty. I added garlic powder/salt/pepper and ground dried cilantro in addition to the fresh chopped cilantro. I will definitely be using this again.

I've been making this dish for a few years now.  I really like it when I use Italian Seasoning in place of the Cilantra and use 5 Cheese Italian.  I've usually use ham or pepper ham, but have used turkey when in a pinch.  My husband requests this often.

Pretty good, very easy to make. Maybe a little dry? *Update* - it's much better with either little dots of cream cheese, or sour cream, added as well!

I loved it.  Fresh cilantro on top ruined it for my husband though- even though he is usually a spice kind of guy.
