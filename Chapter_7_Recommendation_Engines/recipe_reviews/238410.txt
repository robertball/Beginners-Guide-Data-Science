I got this in my "daily emails" and made a triple batch right off the bat to send on the bus with our football team.   Moms have been texting me for the recipe since!  The boys loved them!  Agree with the filling, so am making a double batch today to use up what was left :)

These cookies are amazing!!! They are like a little piece of pumpkin pie.  The filling was a little runny and made almost twice as much as you needed.  No worries there, making another batch.  Plus, put in the fridge to help set the filling.  LOVED :)

I make these every year for my son's school's annual Halloween potluck. They are SO good and always a big hit!! They are easy to make (and I am definitely no baker!), simple, and absolutely delicious! A little tip: the first year I did as instructed and spread the filling on, and it was a huge mess! Since then, I have used gallon sized ziplock bags with the corner cut off (DIY piping bags) to put the filling on, and it works great. So much easier and less messy, and it makes it much easier to put roughly the same amount on each cookie! Highly recommend this recipe!

These are good cookies! Light and fluffy. The icing is sweet but not too sweet.  Kid not make any changes and my boys gobbled them up.
