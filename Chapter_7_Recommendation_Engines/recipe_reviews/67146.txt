This is my recipe.  Just wanted to remind people that the recipe calls for only 8 oz of pasta not the full pound that others have mentioned using and not having enough sauce.  More important is not too dump all the food over all of the pasta at the very beginning.  The way I do it is to just start each plate with a small amount of pasta and then cover liberally with everything else.  The pasta is not meant to be the main component.  Once the balance is less pasta more everything else I think the saiuce is a good amount.  Hope you enjoy...

Great recipe! I found using the ingredient search in an attempt to not waste food in the fridge. I used large sea scallops and only seared them in the rendered fat from the sausage (I didn't wipe out the pan and add oil).

Be sure to buy Basque or Spanish style Chorizo, not Mexican Chorizo. If you use the correct portions of pasta and the correct style of Chorizo, you won't be disappointed!

Thanks for the great recipe.

Good flavor, but there was not enough sauce for the pound of pasta.  I used a jar of white clam sauce instead of the cup of clam broth, but would use two or three jars next time.
The more sauce to dip crusty bread into, the better!

This was fabulous! I couldn't give it 5 stars (because I changed a few things) but it is certainly worth 5. I do have to agree that there isn't enough sauce for the amount of pasta. I would definitely double the amount. That being said, I chopped the peppers to making it more bite sized, and omitted the clam juice (didn't have any). This is one of my new favorite meals, thanks so much George!

I'd give it a 5 except I changed a few things. The first time I made this, I did exactly as the recipe called to do and was disappointed because the pasta ended up being too dry for us. Also there were not enough scallops for that amount of pasta (again for us). So this time I used shells for the pasta, cut the casing off the chorizo and cooked it crumbly. As I did that the pasta was cooking. Then I did the peppers and added some cayenne peppers without the seeds to the red peppers. Next I did the scallops but used a whole pound cut into pieces. I put in a half pound of shrimp as well. When the pasta was done, I drained it then added the peppers, scallops and shrimp to it. Finished as the recipe suggested , but at the end when the wine had reduced by half, I returned all the pasta etc. to the pan and kept on stirring it until everything was coated well. The shells caught part of the chorizo and peppers and it was absolutely delicious.  Thanks for a starter recipe!

Not much flavour other than the flavour of chorizo.  Seems like a stir-fry dumped on pasta.

OUTSTANDING !!! And very simple, slightly time consuming. I used shrimp instead of scallops which shortened the time considerably....WILL ABSOLUTELY MAKE AGAIN!

Hmm, not sure about this one. I didn't like it at all - the flavors just didn't work for me. So, the 3 stars is Husband's grade. The chorizo absolutely floored me - the chorizo I've had in the past was firm, sliceable and, well, sausage-like. The sausage I bought for this was really squishy, and even though I formed it into small balls before browning, they fell apart and turned to sausage sludge. I think this is what put me off the recipe from the start. Oh well. You can't win 'em all.

I made this and it came out great!  The only modification I made is more garlic, because GARLIC..  :)   On a serious note, this was a great recipe to combine scallops and chorizo.  Mine was more chunky as it was a homemade chorizo.

Fantastic!!  The chorizo lends a very interesting taste to the scallops, and the light sauce is fantastic.  I found that there was sufficient sauce, it only lightly coats the pasta, so you can enjoy the taste of the pasta through the sauce.  Since only cooking for two, we had lots of leftovers that were eaten for a couple days without complaint!  This was great and I will definitly pass this along to friends and family!
