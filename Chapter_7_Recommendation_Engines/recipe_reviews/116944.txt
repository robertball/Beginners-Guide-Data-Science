Unique and very tasty.  I did not have fresh rosemary so used dried and also used regular raisins not golden.  Will definitely be making these over and over.

Very good and very unique. I didn't have lemon extract so I used orange extract and orange zest instead and they turned out faboulous. I've made them with and without the raisens and I personally like them sans raisens. These are perfect with a cup of camomile tea.

This recipe does not have sugar listed.  I added 1/2 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  The rosemary adds a very interesting taste that is irresistible.  We ate too many of these tasty cookies; I made them 1" like buttons.  This is in our favorite recipes.  Thank you for the great idea.

Fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing...it was intriguing and delicious - something unusual to impress people. One thing is that the ingredient list doesn't specify what kind or how much sugar to use, only to cream it with the butter and shortening in the directions. I ended up using 1/2 C. brown and 1/2 C. white and that seems just right...not too sweet which is nice with more savory-type ingredients. I switched a few things based on what was on hand and not wanting to leave the house to go to the store, lol. No lemon extract so I juiced half a lemon. No raisins (although I love the suggestion of golden raisins) so cut up dried plums. And I added twice the amount of rosemary since they were for my cousin's birthday and she loves rosemary. Next time (and there WILL be a next time!) I'll use the golden raisins, lemon extract (or maybe orange as another reviewer did), and add sliced/slivered almonds. But this is great as-is (if you add the sugar) and I'm only tweaking for personal preference. A huge hit not often accomplished with cookies!
