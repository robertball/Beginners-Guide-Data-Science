We tried this for the first time tonight and my family LOVED it. I added a 1/2 cup extra breadcrumbs to help with the texture and used an even 2 lbs of ground turkey and was able to get 11 steaks. I will be adding this to my menu rotation.

This turned out quite a bit better than expected. My only changes were cutting the black pepper in half and using reduced sodium soup and gravy mix. When I measured the gravy mix I found the smaller packets now are basically the full 3 Tblsp., so no need to measure. I would definitely use a large sheet pan with sides and line it with foil before spraying with cooking spray. I believe at the end it meant to pour all of the gravy over the patties so that is what I did. Mine needed an extra 15-20 minutes of cook time total in the baking process. I didn't precisely measure the additional cooking time, but baked them until a thermometer hit 165 degrees. I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 because I found them a tad too bread crumb heavy. Although, it seems less so the next day. I would like to try the recipe again with 3/4 of a cup of bread crumbs to see the difference, without altering the texture too much. ty

This was really good! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 2 lbs of meat and an extra 1/2 cup bread crumbs. It wasn't too salty that way, and my 3 kids loved it!

It was great! I used this recipe for the first time and made changes.  Since we are trying to eat healthier these days, I chose turkey over beef.  I wanted lots of flavor so I added 1 small fresh onion and some green bell peppers. (approx. 1/4 cup, I think).    I also used the entire package of the onion soup mix as well as the gravy mix. It was delicious!

This was very good, but tastes like turkey...imagine that!  Very good and plan to try again with beef.  My husband didn't care much for the turkey aftertaste.  My four children gobbled it up, though.  The gravy was delicious and made this meal!  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  I used 2 - 16 oz packages of ground turkey.  If I were to use 1-1/2 Lbs I think it would be a little too salty.  Thanks for the very good recipe.  Good way to use the ground turkey which is on sale often - $2 per lb!  I served with mashed potatoes, corn and salad.  Will use again!

Family loves this recipe.  Great texture on the steaks. Made the steaks the night before so I could just pop them in the oven when I got off work. Placed the makings for the gravy inn the fridge as well. Everything cooked wonderfully and everyone had fully bellies that night.  Instead of combining the gravy on the last part of the recipe I left it separately so everyone could pour their own amount. I also sift out the mushroom bits from the cream of mushroom, no one likes mushrooms in the family so the gravy is very smooth when I make it.  Paired with Mashed potatoes and green beans its always a hit.

This is an excellent recipe! I added extra garlic and used croutons instead of bread crumbs; I had to improvise. I will definitely cook this again.

It was actually very tasty. Not the traditional beef texture, but had lots of flavors. I did let it cook for and extra hour or so. Pairing it with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli made this a great meal for a chilly night.

did not care for this.  it is difficult to take a traditional beef dish and use turkey.  the texture is so different. i do it often because my husband does not eat beef or pork.  i did like the mushroom sauce.

I needed something new to do with ground turkey and I'm glad I tried this recipe. The only alteration I made to the original recipe was using 1 pound of turkey rather than 1.5 because that's what I had. It was really good! My husband and kid gave it 4.5 stars but I'm rounding up because she cleaned her plate! If that doesn't get 5 stars nothing does. I'll definitely make this again. I served it with egg noodles which I think complimented it well.

Turned out better than I expected. I added sausage to help add flavor to the turkey and keep it moist. My family enjoyed it and could not believe that I made them and did not get them frozen. The gravy was a little salty, so I just made so more and mixed with it and it was better.  Just might use this for my meatballs.

Salisbury Steak was one dish I missed after giving up red meats.  This is a perfect substitute very flavorful.
I made it as written . I should have used low-sodium soup, onion soup mix and  gravy mix, as the gravy for this  turned out way too salty.
 I'll be making this again in the future.

Really good! We don't eat beef, so I subbed the brown gravy mix for turkey gravy mix. Also used stuff I had on hand, so I used whole wheat panko mixed with some Ozark seasoning from penzeys and more gravy mix/water because I was serving with mashed potatoes and wanted lots of gravy. I thought it might come out with a stronger turkey flavor but the Worchestershire sauce gave it more of the salisbury steak taste. I cooked the patties on a sheet pan, and then transferred to a big skillet before adding the gravy because I had some crimini mushrooms I wanted to add in and forgot earlier.  I did use 2 full pounds of turkey also. I'm not a huge fan of ground turkey usually but this worked and will be on regular rotation.

Did not have onion soup mix so I googled and made the dry mix using my spices.  Also did not have brown gravy mix but had country gravy mix and used that.   Very tasty and had my father in law show up unexpectedly and he wanted to try it and loved it.  It’s a keeper

It was ok. The gravy was really good, but do some reason the meat didn't taste very flavorful. Lots of gravy fixed that, though.

It turned out good but was a bit strong and spicy.  Next time I will use 1/2 the black pepper, and 1/2 the onion soup mix.  I also think reducing the gravy mix 1/3 might work well too.  The dish was fantastic though and I would love to eat this without heartburn next time.  Very easy to make and serve.

Every week I make my boyfriend a lunch that will last through the week in a crockpot. I've made Egg Bake, Shredded BBQ Chicken, Taco Pie, So getting tired of making the thing over and over, what to make next in a crockpot?!?! Salisbury Steak!!! Allrecipes hasn't let me down yet. I will admit now... I didn't get the chance to try this as the boyfriend whisked it away in the morning before  i could nab a pattie. 

So here's what I did. 
 
I followed the recipe as I had never made this before but modified it to my own. Remember I put this in a crockpot. 

I did 2lb. of ground turkey, instead of beef. I did a Onion mushroom lipton soup mix- 3x in the meat  with  the 2 x eggs, water only 1 c, and bread crumbs I used my eyes to measure haha. Mixed that up in my Kitchen Aid. I wanted to add all the side fixin's as well, but how do you do that when its in a crockpot...you stuff it! 

I took a biscuit  cutter (use whatever size you like) I wanna say I used a 2" scoop for size of the cutter to  get the right meat and a 1" scoop for  the mashed potatoes. I put a layer on the bottom then potatoes then a heaping scoop of meat . forming around the potatoes  and filling to the top  (keeping in mind it will shrink down so you don't want it  thin)  then lift it up. If you don't have  non-stick foil, make sure you spray or oil your pan first.  

Cooking as usual. I layered the patties in the crockpot with baby carrots and fresh green beans, ending with veggies on top. I used the progressive  c

I followed the original recipe exactly and give it 5 stars because we all loved it, even the picky 12 year old! The gravy was amazing over mashed potatoes and tasted even better the next day. After making the original recipe I altered it slightly, my grocery store had an amazing deal on 3 pound packages of ground turkey (only $5.00!!!) so I doubled the recipe and added an 8 ounce package of sliced crimini mushrooms and one can of red wine along with the one can of water to the gravy. This gave the gravy a bit more beefiness and I love mushrooms so I really wanted more than what was just in the soup. A++ recipe as written, you won't regret trying this. Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was good, but the steaks came out too salty. I wouldn't use but half of the onion soup mix unless you double the amount of meet being used.

Usually ground turkey is too dry and lacks flavor, but it was on sale very cheap, so I bought it anyway.  This recipe made it fairly moist and very flavorful.  It still wasn't up to the ground beef and pork level in flavor, but I did enjoy the lighter, leaner version of this classic dish.  5 stars!

I gave four stars instead of five. I was confused about 1 can of water. I was sure if meant broth or cup of water.  Please clarifty for me what it mean say cup water ounces.I got recipe from my coworker. She say it meant water. I was confused on that part of recipe. I added garlic power, onion power, parley flakes and itilan season to turkey and minced garlic and minced onions. When I made gravy mix.  I added cup water to mushroom gravy, and half mixture of onion soup and worshorse source. I let patties bake 20 minutes on one size 20 on other size. Then I like brown in gravry for 10 minute's. I use white rice and string beans. I had  peach cobbler as desert. This recipe was great I made for Sunday dinner.

My boyfriend commented on how good this smelled as I was mixing up the solid part of this recipe.  I knew I'd have to make some changes because I had a 3 lb  ground turkey roll & a 14.75 oz can of mushroom soup.   I doubled the ingredients except for the onion soup mix as it measured almost 6 tablespoons.  I replaced the black pepper with red pepper flakes & added half a medium green pepper diced.  Next time I'll add 2.5 to 3 cups of breadcrumbs to make the steaks a bit firmer.  It was too hot to turn on the stove so, I pan seared the steaks on both sides  to a nice brown color then simmered.  I added the remaining soup and 1 to 1.5 cups of water 1.5 tablespoon of cornstarch and 1/3 cup of unsweetened brewed black coffee. Coffee helps to bring in a beef flavor & color to the broth.  I wound up with 20 steaks.  Made 10 & froze 10.  Definitely will be making this again :)!

I followed the recipe, but I had to make a few changes because I had 2 1/2 pounds of ground turkey. I used the Lipton onion soup that said "beef onion flavor." I also doubled the sauce. I didn't have any onions, so I used two shallots.  It turned out great! I will definitely make this again! I think this takes the Place of my meatloaf recipe! :)

I took the advice from other reviewers, and used 2 lbs of turkey and extra bread crumbs. My family, really liked it. Me? I thought it was ok. I didn't like the texture. 4 out of 5 liked it, so I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.  :)

We did not enjoy this. Gravy too salty, too much added to the turkey, it just tasted like salty bread crumbs. Turkey was definitely cooked plenty, but was mushy inside.
