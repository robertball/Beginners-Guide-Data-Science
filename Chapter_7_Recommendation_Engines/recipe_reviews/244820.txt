Delicious, it is. Juice, it is not. This has the consistency of a smoothy, but don't get me wrong, it has a wonderful flavour. The mango and the banana are so sweet you'd think there were added sugars. Put this in your weekly drink rotation. Thanks for the recipe.

I used Silk  "coconutmilk." I think real coconut milk would be too thick for me in this smoothie. I used a frozen banana and frozen mango chunks, which made it icy and cold, like I like it. It was sweet enough without any added sweetner. This recipe makes a big serving.  I'll try this one again sometime.

I used Silk coconut milk and both my banana and mangoes were frozen. This is definitely a smoothie not juice as Buckwheat Queen stated. Very good, regardless of whether it's juice or a smoothie.

I sub Brussels sprouts leaves from my garden. I weigh everything, so I find that 64 oz of leaves is a good amount. I have also used spinach and kale. In addition, I add 1 T of ground flaxseed or 11 oz of chia seeds. If you don't have coconut milk on hand, unsweetened 1% milk, almond  and cashew milk work great!

This was very good. I did, however, make a few changes: used unsweetened coconut beverage instead of the coconut milk (lower fat content), used kale in place of spinach, and used 1 cup of frozen mango chunks.  I will make this again, possibly add some flax or chia seeds. Thanks for the recipe.
