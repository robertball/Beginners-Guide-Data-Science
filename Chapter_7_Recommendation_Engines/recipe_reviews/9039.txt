This is a good BASE recipe which is why I gave it five stars...everyone loved this but I made serious changes.
I used 18 corn tortillas. I cooked and then cubed the chicken ahead of time. In a 5 qt pan I mixed a large can of enchilada sauce, a small can of green chiles, 1 can of corn, 1 can of black beans, two cups of white rice, and one package of taco seasoning. I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to this after allowing it to cook about 15 mins. I sprayed the bottom of the pan with nonstick spray and added 6 tortillas spread out, topped with chicken mixture, topped with shredded cheddar and pepper jack cheese, layered 6 more tortillas, topped with chicken mixture and cheeses, another layer of tortillas and mix and cheese and left open faced. I sprinkled with crushed white corn tortilla chips. I cooked in the oven for about 10 to 15 mins on 350. It was NOT messy and it was SO delicious! WILL MAKE AGAIN...hope you try to changes it will make a clean, easy, flavorful, quick casserole.

OMG...this is going to be a favorite for my family.  My husband raved and wants it every Saturday. I used beans instead of corn and added tops of green onions, sour cream and nachos on the top. I used spicy enchilada sauce and added 2 chopped jalapeno peppers because my family likes spicy food. Served with Mexican Rice III from here. Great last minute meal.

Sorry I can't give it a five.  It was good but not great.  I scaled it up for a large crowd and they liked it and several asked for the recipe.  This ia a variant on an old war horse of a recipe and can be considered pretty reliable.  In my case I took advice of other reviewers and served on bed of crushed chips rather than layered corn tortillas.  With 70 people in the buffet line it would have been too risky to have the tortillas be hard to cut through, and the bed of chips instead made it very spoonable.  Just poor some enchilada sauce over the bed of chips and also mix some into the chicken mixture and it will be fine.

This recipe is so easy.  I will make again for sure.  I did make a few minor changes.  I had flour tortillas on hand so I used those rather than corn.  I suspect corn would have been better.  I used mild green chiles, but cut the amount in half since I was making for my 18 month old.  I coated the chicken in a mixture of olive oil, garlic and cumin and baked.  I also tore the tortillas and rolled in the sauce before layering and used the remaining sauce to pour over the top of the casserole.  I also put a little extra cheese on top the last few minutes of baking.  
The dish is very creamy and tasty.  My 18 month old loved it.  It is really easy to make and perfect for the nights you are in a hurry.  I cooked extra chicken and put in the freezer for future use.

I thought that the idea of this recipe was good.  There were no instructions on how the chicken should be used (ie-diced, chopped, shredded) so I just shredded it.  Also, there was no instruction on what to do with the extra enchilada sauce, so I just poured some over each layer.  Overall it was good, but took just as much work as regular enchiladas would!

It tasted great, but it looked kind of like gruel with corn in it.  I think if we make it again, we'll roll it up in some tortillas for the eye appeal.

Very good flavor with the green chiles, but only needs one can of enchilada sauce.

This was pretty good.  I followed the suggestions of the other cooks and used only 1 can of sauce and the leftovers were a little dry.  Next time I will use 1 can and add some salsa to the enchilada sauce.  The leftovers were quite good.  I also added onion and garlic to the mixture.  Thanks for an easy tasty casserole.

Instead of using whole pieces of chicken, I cut them into pieces.  This has made a difference.  I have used hard tortillas, as I had trouble finding soft.  However I would reccommend this recipe to anyone.

Awesome recipe.  I am a teacher and I made this for our hispanic heritage potluck dinner.  We had 6 long tables full of food and by the time I got to my contribution it was practically gone.  Yummy.  I will make this often!

This was very good and definitely worth making again but I only gave it 4 stars because, as written, it seemed a little empty.  Next time, I'll follow previous reviewers suggestions of adding black beans, possibly olive, etc.  Only change made was to add a can of Rotel tomatoes and green chilis (didn't have just green chilis).  Pretty good as is.  Really good potential.

Love this: great use for left over rottiserie chicken (I used the sticky chicken recipe from this site).  My changes (everybody does it!): instead of sour cream, I used cottage cheese which made the casserole very creamy.  I also used one small can of jalepenos chopped and one small of green peppers: it's the best combo I've had so far.  I only made two layers, which was fine and topped with cheddar cheese.  excellent!

Great recipe with a great mexican flavor.  My wife was very nervous about the (2) cans of Green Chilies, but the Sour Cream really cut the hot of the Chilies and just left you with an excellent flavor. Once again......  Great Recipe.

Great "Basic" Recipe ... I made a few alterations.  I swapped Taco Sauce for the enchillada sauce and added a layer of white rice mixed w/ mexican black beans ... delicious!

Great base for a recipe, but like many others I made modifications.  Everyones' suggestions were very helpful.  I had to eliminate the chiles, because there is no way my eight year old would eat them.  To replace the spice of the chiles, I used cumin and chili power. I used Mexican blend cheese.  I cooked the chicken on my Foreman grill.  I layered mine differently to make it more like an enchilada.  I layered tortillas - chicken filling - tortillas.  I only needed one can of enchilada sauce.  After dipping tortillas in sauce, I still had some left.  I spread it on top and sprinkled on some cheese.  We decided that next time we'd leave out the corn and just have it as a side dish.  I had a lot of tortilla shells left over.  My eight year old cut them in to small pieces, sprayed them with cooking spray, and lightly salted them.  We baked them on 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes.  We dipped them in salsa and bean dip.  Everything together made a excellent meal.  This is a great recipe to let kids help make.  My eight year old used my kitchen shears and cut the tortillas and cooked the corn and bean dip.  Not only did we have a great meal, but we had a blast making it together.  We will be making this casserole again!!

I loved this recipe, and so did the 4 children that I was feeding it to.  Was a tad spicy, but they chose it over the spaghetti O's that was offfered instead.  A lot of sauce left over, so I'm going to look for other things that call for it to serve as well.

My search is over! This was the best enchilada recipe I have ever made. I love not having to fill and roll the tortillas. These were very creamy, and flavorful. I added extra cheese, and sliced black olives to the top. Thank you Karen!! Delicious!!

I live in the Dominican Republic, and therefore can not get enchilada sauce.  I made this recipe using salsa instead, and ommitted the jalapenos and EVERYONE loves it.  If I ever return to the states I will try it with enchilada sauce, and re-review it.  For now it is awesome with the salsa.

We loved this. I added onion and salt into the mix to give it more flavor. I also used the cheese as a layer instead of mixing it in w/the chicken. Another hint to give it more flavor is to add onion and/or garlic with the chicken while cooking. I would definitely recomend this.

After reading many reviews, I made some changes- I left out the corn, added sliced black olives, cooked chopped onion, salsa, black beans and added more cheese.  I used Mexi-blend cheese instead of cheddar and for the top I poured some enchilada sauce, sprinkled on some cheese and black olives to make it 'prettier'.  I was very happy it came out perfect because I was delivering a meal to a family who just had a baby.  I served it with homemade Mexican rice and sweet corn cakes.  It was a huge hit at my house..I hope they liked it too!  I will definitely make this one again. Thanks!!!

We really enjoyed this one. I did add a few more ingredients which included a 
can of black beans, can of Mexican style diced tomatoes, chopped red bell 
pepper, green onions and some chili powder and cayenne pepper for some 
extra zest. I also lightened up on the sour cream and cheese. Truly a 
wonderful dish!

I made this recipe last year and it was delicious. I think I took the advice of some of the other posters and used only 1 can of sauce. My step-son said that it smelled like a Mexican restaurant in our house. We loved it! Thanks Karen!

This recipe passed the ultimate test...my kids loved it! They even ask for me to make it on a regular basis and will ask for leftovers.  The only thing I did differently, was that I layered everything instead of mixing it together. I've made it with both hamburger meat and chicken.

Anything that my 3 children ALL like gets 5 stars from me.  Left out the corn and peppers, used mild enchilada sauce, and had salsa, bl olives and fresh tomatoes available for the top!  UMM UMM GOOOD!

This was a good recipe but made the following changes to make it better: exchanged chicken for hamburger (1 lb.), added 1 cup of salsa, omitted the corn. We will try it later with the chicken.

This is delicious!  I make it with or without the corn depending on which family I am making it for.  It is super easy and can be mostly prepared in advanced and then just thrown in the oven when everyone is ready to eat.

Husband & I really enjoyed this one.  Kids were less thrilled but did eat it.  I made a few changes: baked chicken instead of boiled, added a layer of tortillas and cheese on top.  I used montery jack & chedder cheeses and doubled the amount the recipe called for. I will definitely make this one again.

I made this and it turned out excellent. I used 2 large flour tortillas on the bottom. Then I added the mixture and then a layer of tortilla chips and then another layer of the mixture. I was going to add black beans but they didn't smell good when we opened the can.

I got this recipe from Allrecipes a few years ago and have been making it regularly every since.  I just made it again a couple nights ago and my husband and I are having our third meal.  It is one of the few things I make that he doesn't complain about leftovers.  I do adjust the amount of tortillas to about 12.  You have to use corn, not flour because it really makes the flavor authentic.  I also put a light layer of shredded cheese on top because it makes it more appealing, and I think the more cheese the better!  Otherwise, I make it exactly as described.  I let it sit for a bit before serving so it's not a plate of mush.  It goes excellent with the Mexican Rice II from this site and fresh quacamole and chips. I LOVE this recipe because it is delicious, but it also reheats well, is cost efficient and can feed a crowd, or be used for several meals for a small family.

I made this for a potluck for 20 people.  It turned out well but I did cut the amt of sour cream, and corn and added sliced black olives.  I did not drain the chiles well enough and it was a little watery but it thickened up.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it and it was not expensive to make.

Overall, I think this recipe was good.  We added an extra can of green chili's as well as some black beans.  It was still missing a little flavor.  Maybe needs some salt and pepper?  Thanks.

An enchilada by any other name... I was kind of hoping for something different, but aside from the addition of corn, this was just an enchilada in layers.

Made this recipe last night and was disappointed with appearance, although taste was ok. After reading other reviews, I would add an additional cup of corn, black olives, onion, salt & pepper to mixture. I also shredded my chicken. I would top with some cheese to make it look nicer. I will try it again with the changes. My guys really liked it.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I cubed the chicken before assembling the casserole.  Also, I added sliced ripe olives and a few chopped jalapeno peppers.  The casserole was "soupier" than I expected but the flavor was very good.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I did not enjoy this casserole very much.  The tortillas got so soggy that they almost disappeared.  It was pretty mushy.  Crushed tortilla chips on top were a great improvement, though.

Good, but not worth 5 stars.  I put all of the filling in between two layers of enchilada sauce coated tortillas.  I sprinkled extra cheese on top.  Will add olives next time.

This recipe was really good, and relatively easy to make! I used several of the other reviews and only used 1 can of Enchilada Sauce. What was left from that can, I poured over the top of the dish. I also used Mexican Blend cheese, rather than Cheddar Cheese.

I thought this recipe sounded great and could easily be adapted to a vegetarian dish. So here's what I did.
I finely chopped red onion, garlic and cilantro and sautéed it in a skillet just for a couple minutes, I then added a can of black beans, a can of corn, and approximately 1 cup of Spanish rice that I had made to give it more substance since I didn't add chicken. I made step 2 and step 3 above. I then assembled it in lasagna fashion ( tortillas, bean mixture, and cheese mixture) ending w a layer of tortillas. I poured remaining sauce over the top and baked 45 min. last 15 min I topped w 1 cup of shredded cheese and some olive. Smells delicious! I will post a picture as soon as its out of the oven.

I quite like the taste of it and that it was easy to make, but I think this would taste better with a stronger tasting meat like beef or pork.

This casserole got mixed reviews from the family of seven that I served it to. We all thought it was a little on the bland side. I added black beans and after reading the reviews I decided to layer the cheese on top of the meat instead of adding it to the meat mixture. I also followed the reviews of cutting up the tortillas and I went ahead and used all twelve in the package. And I also increased the corn. I agree there is too much sauce. Pretty easy to do, but not really pretty to look at. Kind of a big blob on the plate.

I have made this recipe twice now...it's actually pretty tasty. I do agree with the addition of taco seasoning to the enchilada sauce. Ive made it with cubed chicken, but also with ground beef as well, both were good. I only needed about 6 tortillas cut into strips. I layered the tortillas, meat, corn and black beans...omitted the sour cream as my hubby wont touch it, sauce, cheese and then repeated. topped with cheese and in the oven for 35 mins. quick, easy and tasty.

This was so easy to make!  The only thing that took a while was shredding the chicken.  I put some enchilada sauce on bottom then spread half the chicken mixture over and a little more sauce then the next layer of tortillas and some more sauce and then the rest of the chicken.  Finished with a little more sauce on top.  It was so yummy.  I added a little cilantro on top before serving.  My husband acutually had it the next day and he NEVER eats leftovers.  Served it with the Mexican Rice III someone else suggested.  Will definately make again!

True, this is an excellent base recipe... and in all the reviews I don't see anyone adding CILANTRO!!! If you want to liven up the flavor add cilantro, a couple of seeded jalapenos, black olives, keep the corn, and the black beans.... Cut the corn tortillas into strips and fry them up yourself to leave out the salt and you have a HIT!

My family loves this recipe. I used flour tortillias instead of corn and it came out great. I think I liked the texture better that way. The flavor is incredible. Not too spicy for my kids, but a lot of interesting tastes, textures and flavors for me. A definite hit!

This recipe tasted good, my only reservation is that when you remove it from the baking dish it "falls" and looks a bit sloppy when served. I added some chili powder, paprika, salt & pepper to give it some extra flavor. I liked one of the reviewer's ideas to add black beans (I will do that when I make it again) And, as another reviewer mentioned, you only use about 1/2 of the enchilada sauce to dip, so I did drizzle some of the extra sauce in between layeres. I also sprinkled some Mexican style cheese on top before baking. I served it with some chopped green onions and black olives.

This recipe had me a little concern the directions werent exact, and at first it looked so messy and like it was just thrown together but it turned out great!! My husband even went back for seconds. I only did a few things different I took the advice from one of the reviews and added the rest of the enchilada sause (waste not want not) and added it to the top and about five minutes before it was done i added more chesse. I also served sweet peas on the side. It was a success!!

I made this with leftover turkey after Thanksgiving and it was delicious!  I left out the corn and replaced with green chiles, and added olives to the mixture and on top too.  Looked great and tasted better, Thanks.

Delicious! I had my doubts about this, since I'm not an enchilada person, but my husband thought it sounded good. Boy, am I glad we tried it! It was wonderful! I did make a few minor changes: I eyeballed the amount of enchilada sauce (I only used about half of a 19 oz container) and sour cream (maybe a tad more than the recommended amount), used more corn than called for (frozen, straight from the bag), added a can of black beans, only used one can of chilis and cooked the chicken in a skillet with a bit of broth. I sprinkled each layer of the mix with onion powder, a touch of Cholula hot sauce, and did not mix in the cheese, but sprinkled it on top of each layer. Though not a beautiful dish by any means, it was wonderfully delicious and no flavor overtook the others... a perfect blend! I'll be making this again!

So good! My family loved it. It was very filling and easy to make. I also found that 2 cans of enchilada sauce was too much, and I only used one can of chile peppers. My family doesn't like very spicy food. Great recipe, must try!

Didn't do a thing for us. Two cans of enchilada sauce is way too much. I also feel the cheese was a bit much. I sauteed the chicken instead of boiling. By cutting the chicken into bite size pieces my husband used this the next day as a dip, he enjoyed it that way.

This recipe has good flavor but the texture was boring. I will try it again maybe with crushed tortilla chips in place of the corn tortillas to give it some crunch. Also two cans of enchilada sauce would be way to much. I fried the chicken breast in butter in a  nonstick skillet  seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder.

I would've given it a 3 the first day but the leftovers kicked it up to a 4.  I followed exactly, although I dipped the first layer of tortillas in hot enchilada sauce and the second layer in mild.  Yum.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Went back for seconds! I dont suggest using flour tortillas(which I did cause I dont care for corn tortillas) because they turn out mushy. To make the recipe a little more healthy I used fat free sour cream and fat free cheese. Works out great!!!

This recipe was good. My teenagers loved it. As someone suggested, I added black beans and instead of corn, I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies and used low fat sour cream. I also used the medium enchilada sauce. For looks, I topped it off with the corn tortillas. I will definitely make this again.

This was a good recipe, I'll probably make it again. It's easy, and I cooked my chicken in a crock pot the night before to save time. I also used a regualr sauce and one made with green chili. It was very good, but it is a heavy(hearty) meal...

Pretty good, though somewhat bland. Certainly quick and easy. Because corn, chicken, sour cream and tortillas are all fairly bland on their own, I added some salsa for flavor and still needed to salt it. Also only used 1 can of enchilada sauce and it was plenty wet. Would work well for kid's milder palates.

This recipe is excellent.  I use sweet green and red bell peppers in place of the chiles because I don't like hot stuff.  We make this recipe frequently.  I love how easy it is to make.

With a few adjustments this recipe was great.
I tossed in some black olives and a some beans and it turned out great. I don't like green chiles so I left them out.
I even made it again with beef and it was good.
As for the leftover enchilada sauce, I drizzeled it over the casserole before I put it in the oven.
But I only used one can as I could not see using more than one.
I can't believe some of you did not like the recipe.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  My two sons were not thrilled.  I read the reviews before we tried it.  Therefore, I reccomend that you cut the tortillas into 1 to 2 inch pieces and toss them in the enchilada sauce before spreading them in the pan (I only used one can).  I increased the cheddar cheese to 3 cups instead of two, and that took care of the sloppiness that I had been warned about in the reviews.  It turned out great!

It was delicious, next time I'll add a little extra enchilada sauce and maybe some guacamole to top it off.

This casserole is absolutely delicious! It didn't have as much kick as I was expecting but that was good since I'm not a big fan of spicy. One of the best things about this recipe is how easily it can be changed to fit individual taste and I'd love to try it using ground beef next time. The enchilada sauce really added to the casserole and I can't wait to try it again!

I love enchiladas, but did not enjoy this recipe. I'm a texture person, and couldn't get over the corn, and it needed something in addition to sour cream (possibly cream of chicken soup).

Instead of enchilada sauce, I mixed a can of crushed tomatoes with a can of rotel, added chili, onion, and garlic powders, and let simmer for a few minutes.  At the advice of anoter reviewer, also added black beans and corn to the sauce.  Alternated layers (sour cream with chicken and peppers and cheese, tortillas, then enchilada sauce, followed by tortillas again).  Very good.

Liked the recipe however, I changed one thing: I used chicken thighs and added adobo type seasonings to cook them as opposed to boiling chicken breasts. Gave amazing flavor to the dish. Even my husband raved about this dish. We'd like to add 4.5 stars we give it.

Quite tasty with the changes I made. However, it looked kinda gross. My family really liked it though. I substituted kidney beans for the corn, added chili pepper, cumin and chopped onions. Thankfully too I realized ahead of time that one can of enchilada sauce was plenty, two would have been overkill and made soup.

Very good.  I added some taco seasoning, cumin and cilantro to boost the flavor.  We enjoyed it for 2 nights and it did reheat nicely.

Very good. I always try to rate the exact recipe the first time, but I did leave out the corn. My family liked it as is, but the second time I added black olives, onions, and black beans. We also tried flour tortillas. They went crazy over it. Very easy recipe to add to for personal taste. Next time I will try chips instead. We eat this often!!

It looks like we are in the minority, but my son and I did not care for this at all. It was bland and just not very good. We didn't even save the leftovers. Seeing all the people who really enjoyed it, I'd swear that we didn't even eat the same meal.

This was good but a bit bland. Next time I will use the hotter/spicier enchilada sauce, and maybe some olives and fresh cilantro to give it more kick. I used a package of 12 tortillas as 9 didn't seem to cover the layers. It definitely helped to pour some of the leftover sauce over the top before baking. We used the leftovers as burrito filling in tortillas for a quick lunch.

A five star after i re-did the recipe...i added one can of Ranch Style Beans drained on top of first layer of tortillas...i cut the sour cream to 1 cup and added 1 can mushroom soup(undiluted)...used one can only of the Enchilada Sauce and not even all of that...added it to the sour cream/chicken mixture along with a chopped onion which i cooked in microwave till fairly well done...also added to this mix some chili pwd., garlic pwd., and cumin to taste...cut the green chilis down to one can and i used a whole can of corn instead of the frozen...would definitely make again....one other thing--i bought a mild Old El Paso Enchilada Sauce that was so hot i had to throw it out...if you are after a mild one don't get that one.

I thought this OK.  I was thinking I wouldnt make it again but when my husband and 8 year old daughter had some they couldn't stop talking of how good it was.  Next time I think I will use flour tortillas instead.  It was easy and the family like it so its a winner in my book.

I used a few more jalapenos (seeds and all) to make this a little more spicy.

Fabulous recipe! Originally done for a Spanish project (received an "A"!) and now it's a family favorite. If this 15-year-old can cook it (and enjoy it, I'm a fussy eater), then anybody can!

I thought this recipe needed a little kick so I used Fiesta Cannned Corn..which is corn with some chopped peppers added (you can find this near the other canned corn in most stores), and I also put about 1/2tbsp of Cumin to the filling..you can add less or more depending on how spicy you would like it.

I was very disappointed with the consistency of this casserole.  Very mushy.

I followed the suggestions given about adding 3 cups of cheese and I think it worked out really well.  I used white corn tortillas and that gave it a really nice flavor.  I cut them into 2 inch strips.  Also, I had a few tortilla strips left over so I went ahead and dipped them into the enchilada sauce put a couple on the top, just for decoration.  Really great dish!

This recipe is easy to put together.  I used only one can of enchilada sauce for a sturdier casserole.  Great Tex Mex flair.

A great combination to fit a nutritious meal into one dish.  I varied the peppers by adding Ro-Tel instead.  Even my one-year-old LOVED it!

I used low fat sour cream and cheese and it was still great.  I wanted to substitute whole wheat tortillas but couldn't find any so I used whole wheat pita bread.  The bread turned out soggy but that's not the fault of your recipe, but my substitution which I will not repeat next time. The rest of it is delicious!

Definitely a keeper.  Great for those of us who love anything vaguely Mexican.  The enchilada sauce I used was a little too spicy for my granddaughter.

I liked this dish. Very tasty. But I did have a lot of extra enchilada sauce left over that went to waste.

We love this recipe and it is a favorite request at potluck parties.  We add two cans of chilis for a stronger flavor.  It is great for lunch the next day too.

This recipe was delicious even when I used low fat ingredients!  I found it's better if you rip up the tortillas into smaller pieces.  If you like mexican, you'll enjoy this dish!

This was really good. It could use some more spice though. Next time I know that I am going to make this, I will make it the night after I make chicken so that it will be even faster to make.

This recipe really pleased my family!  They especially loved the corn in the casserole.
