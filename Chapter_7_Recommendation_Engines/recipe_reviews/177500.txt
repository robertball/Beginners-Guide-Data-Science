I needed a quick dinner tonight--this fit the bill perfectly. My oldest boy made this pretty much on his own, I suggested he make a few small changes. We added a small chopped onion, some fresh minced garlic and a little of my homemade taco seasoning. The boys wanted "taco smiles" so we served this in taco shells (instead of on sandwich buns) with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and a little reduced fat sour cream. It was a little sloppy but honestly, we were too hungry to care. With a side of cilantro-lime rice, this was a nice filling dinner that literally took 20 minutes from start to finish and my son was quite proud he made a meal that his little brother and mother liked.

very good!  used 2 lbs ground beef.  while browning, added minced onion and a couple dashes of chili powder. Used 1 can of tomato soup, 1 cup of salsa, and a packet of taco season. Simmered for 15 minutes.  added a handful of cheddar cheese and mixed it up. Served!  Very good change of pace!!

This turned out nice!  I followed some other reviewers advice and added a packet of spicy taco seasoning (I was making it for my boyfriend and he loves spicy food).  I also added 1/4 cup of chopped onions to the ground beef as it cooked, as well as 1/8 tsp of cumin and a 1/4 tsp. chili powder.  After mixing everything in I splashed it a few times with Franks hot sauce and piled it onto buns.  Easy, and I will be making it again!

They tasted fine.  The only reason I gave these three stars is because they had the same taste as a can of Manwich and not a taco taste.  I was expecting a more spicy taco taste, which mine did not have.  Cheese tends to kill some of the spice.  Maybe if you use hot salsa this would be different from a sloppy joe.

I can't believe this has not been tried by more people! My husband loves these and so do the kids! I add a package of Taco Seasoning and About 1/2 to 3/4 jar of Salsa. I toast the buns in the oven and it is oh so good and inexpensive. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

I added taco seasoning, chili powder, and cumin, and green pepper.  Next time I will not do the extra chili powder and cumin.  A little spicy for my taste.  The taco seasoning is a must.

I would have to say, this is way better than canned sloppy joes. My husband and 2 boys loved it. Would make this more often. Thanks!

Amazing!! Even better than I thought they might be. I did add onion while cooking the ground beef and added cumin to the mixture. When done, I mixed the cheese right into the joe's. Family requested to keep this as a regular!!

Super easy, and a great twist on "basic" sloppy joes. Cheddar is hard to come by where I live (France), but I found that a mix of mozzarella and emmenthal was a good alternative.

My family loved it. My very picky eater ate two of them which is amazing. He couldnt even tell that there was onions and peppers in it. I did use a mild salsa, and at first it tasted spicy but after it cooks a little it lost the flavor I was going for. I added more salsa after I took it off the heat to regain some of the original flavor back. It was great and evertone enjoyed it.

This is my new way to make sloppy joes!  I love this recipe.  Does anyone remember when Taco Bell used to sell the Bell Beefer sandwiches?  These sloppy joes remind me of those.  My stomach doesn't like spicy foods so much any more, so I use a little less salsa, and I need to let the liquid cook down for about 15 minutes.  Such an easy main dish!

So I normally don't make stuff like this....but I had a LONG day, and needed something that I could throw together quickly.  My husband and daughter both really like it, so did I ! It was easy, filling and yummy.  We tried pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar, yum :-)

In our opinion, there wasn't enough sauce to really make these 'sloppy' but the taste was good. Be sure to season the beef to your taste beforehand as the salsa and tomato soup won't do much.

Just so easy and really very good. I added some onion and omitted the cheese. Serve with a salad and everyone is happy. Thanks.

This was decent, the flavor was great after you cooked on highfor a couple of minutes after all ingredients were well combined. The one thing I can say, is that when doubled, the recipe's consistancy is rather liquidy. I just thought it was rather liquidy but my kids found it to be just fine. However this can go either way, 1. either double the meat and leave all the rest alone OR 2. double the meat and X out the additional can of soup. But I didn't I made exactly to a T doubled as written and my kids said it was fabulous. But seeing how my kids were fine with the results..I guess all is good =)

Very good, if you're looking for something fast and easy!  I thought they were pretty tasty, but my husband just loved them and went back for seconds.  I used medium salsa and was concerned it was going to be a little too spicy for my toddler, who does not like spicy food, but no complaints.  In fact, he asked what the were called and then said, "I like sloppy joes!"

I found this recipe in a magazine years ago and my friends and family LOVED IT!!! My best friend is coming out for dinner tonight and requested this so thank goodness I found it. This is so quick and easy it's great for a busy family. One change I made was I put it on toasted english muffins instead of buns because it kept us from getting mushy bread. Otherwise it was super yummy!!

A family favorite! I also add a package of taco seasoning, and put out optional toppings of shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and avocado in addition to the cheese. YUM!

Turned out ok, but tasted just like a sloppy joe, with a little more kick. Cheaper to buy Manwich and I prefer the original better. I cooked mine with onions, which definitely made it taste better. Probably would be bland without them.
