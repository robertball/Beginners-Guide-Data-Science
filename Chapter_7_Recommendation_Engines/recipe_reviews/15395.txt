If you're looking for a great recipe that's extremely easy this is it! My family loved it and it only took me a few minutes to throw it in the oven. Will definitely make again - very flavorful and tender! I didn't really follow the ingredient amounts I just coated each breast liberally with brown sugar and garlic powder/salt. I did add some butter too. Will cover 1/2 way through next time though to get the tops as tender as the bottoms though. Awesome!

I usually don't like sweet meat but this chicken had a pretty good flavor. I did end up adding a lot more garlic and some more brown sugar than was called for plus I poured melted butter over the chicken first.

My family loves this chicken. I would suggest ignoring the measurements given in the recipe. We use the garlic salt liberally on both sides of the chicken and top with about of teaspoon of brown sugar per leg. Delicious!

This is such a delicious recipe and soooo simple. I was hesitant on making it but went ahead anyway. Boy am I glad I made it. I never measure my ingredients so I know that I added more garlic salt than it called for plus more sugar. I had a 5 lb chicken to cook. Very good recipe.

Not bad but the brown sugar really overwhelms the garlic flavor. Try adding extra garlic.

Very good. I did not have any garlic salt so I used good ol' Johny seasoning salt. I like my chicken "fall apart done" so I cooked mine 20 min longer than called for but may have been because I used whole chicken leg quarters. Will definatly keep this recipe handy.

Very easy and the hubby and the kids loved it. It was just a bit to plain to get 5 stars. I am making again tonight and it will be a regular in our menu.

REALLY GOOD CHICKEN!! I used just one boneless/skinless breast. Put a little garlic powder then a little salt then well a BIT more brown sugar and popped it in a 400degree oven. The oven was a little too hot but I had my hubby's dinner in there and needed to share. The brwn sugar melted a little and what dripped off the chicken started to burn in the bottom of the pan. It was ALMOST done at this point so I pulled it out and popped in in the microwave to finish it off. It was tender and juicy! Will deff do this again but will use a lower heat.:) UPDATE Made this chicken again tonight (Sep 20) and it was FABULOUS!! Best chicken I have ever had. SERIOUSLY! I used boneless skinless. salt on the chick then a good dose of garlic powder then a GREAT does of brown sugar. It was a really large breast and I used about 1/4 LOOSELY packed cup piled on top of chick. I covered the bottom of the glass dish around the chick with water. Maybe 1/3 cup? And about 3 pats of butter also around the chicken. Baked at 350 for maybe an hour? didn't look at the time just cut it open. It was at least 45 mins. The sugar melted off and mixed with the water and butter to make a WONDERFUL glaze and the water kept the chicken nice and humid. It was SO juicy and moist!

So easy! not many ingredents needed at ALL. Good for picky eaters. I made chicken drum sticks and needed more than 1 hr to bake. I used b. sugar and honey. Next time I may use fresh garlic and let it marinade with salt then add the sugar and honey (as recommended) and it should turn out even better.

This is a wonderful EASY recipe. It got rave reviews from my husband for the salt/sweet counterpoint. The key is to not skimp on the garlic salt and brown sugar. The next time I make it however I will bake it for about 30-45 minutes and skim the fat before I add the brown sugar in order to keep more of the carmelized sweet sauce on the serving portions.

This really was pretty darn good (just shy of "incredible"). I did have to up the temp to 425 about 45 minutes into the cooking time because it still looked pretty raw and then continued to cook for another 15 minutes (that may be the fault of my old oven though). For as easy as it was it deserves the 5 stars.

INCREDIBLE! This was almost too easy! Based on reviews I didn't measure the garlic salt and just sprinkled it liberally over boneless skinless thighs. Then I sprinkled brown sugar over them without measuring as well (maybe about a tsp each). I also added a very small amt of chicken broth to the bottom of the pan but found with thighs it probably wasn't necessary. Everyone should try to this recipe and tweak the amt of garlic salt to their likingbecause it's easy and INCREDIBLE!

Super juicy - but not very flavorful. I read prior reviews and rubbed both sides with garlic salt and used a generous amount of brown sugar on top of each one. The flavor we could taste was very good though: )

Not so incredible. I don't know this just didn't do anything for me. I was looking for a quick and easy chicken recipe and while this was it... it just wasn't very good. Husband gave it an "Okay" which earned it an extra star but that's not saying much.

This IS incredible. Since I only made two large chicken breasts I cut the cooking time to 48 minutes. I also did what the others did - melted butter dipped the chicken into it put the sugar and garlic salt in a plastic bag and shook the chicken in the bag to cover. Excellent!

For something so simple this was very yummy! I added equal amounts of garlic salt and sugar and added chili powder as well. It got a little too dark for my liking so next time I'll cover it for the first half of the cooking time. This was good on the first day but incredible the next day. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

the chicken turned out juicy as heck but the coating didn't work for me...it made the skin kin dof soft and mealy and added very little flavor...maybe I did something wrong.

I used chicken breasts (had on hand) and boiled them before baking (for faster cooking). I added frozen carrots and olive oil before cooking and everything was finished perfectly in about 30 min. The carrots were unexpectedly sweet (duh I guess!) and my kids devoured every bite! The brown sugar was a wonderful change to ordinary chicken.

This is my new favorite recipie! I was a little nervous to try it because it seemed so easy. I didn't have any garlic salt so I used Mrs Dash seasoning salt. It found it very similar to burbon chicken and incredibly simple. Amazing!

Cooked this for the guys tonight and they loved it! Will definitely make it again. I did not use butter like others suggested in their reviews. Instead I sprayed my baking dish with pam and each piece of chicken with a little bit too so the spice and sugar would stick. I cooked boneless skinless chicken breasts for exactly one hour and they were fabulous! I was delighted they were Not all brown sugar sweet just enough for a great taste combo! I served ours with garlic/herb noodles and peas. Should've made more. TRY IT!! IT'S SO EASY!!

It was great. I would of never of thought to put garlic and brown sugar together but it worked. I did use a little butter. I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder and sea salt. I used my stone pan to cook it in and turned the chicken breast over half way through and seasoned the other side. I'll use it again and recomend it to my friends.

Not too bad...I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder and regular salt instead. Came out pretty well might make again if I'm out of other ideas:P I also used thighs instead and baked for about 30 minutes.

I was looking for another recipe when I accidently stumbled on this one. The reviews for the most part seemed favorable and since I was short on time I thought what the heck it s worth trying. The brown sugar made for a very crispy tasty skin on the chicken. My husband who generally complains about the littlest of things at meal time liked it quite a bit. I used chicken thighs. First I scraped away as much excess fat as I could with a small knife. I then added a little water to granulated garlic to hydrate it. Mashed some room temperature butter into the garlic (since the butter was salted I didn t add anymore). As for amounts I used that s a judgement call depending on how much chicken you re using. I took a glob of the garlic butter and smeared it under the skin of each chicken thigh before placing it in the baking dish. I then sprinkled a generous amount of brown sugar over each thigh. Baked it in a preheated 375 degree oven for 55 minutes. Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. I didn t find it necessary to cover the chicken and it turned out extremely moist. I will definitely be making this again and again.

OMG! all i can say it that i joined just to review this chicken! i love this site but never felt the need to join or review anything b4.. i love this recipe. and i cannot believe it is not a 5 star.. i do "tweak" it to our liking.. i use kellogs corn flake crumbs and about a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and seasonings we like.. (cajun and garlic) i have NEVER had a batch that did not turn out the same everytime.. every one is soooo good. i use that method on everything i bake pork chicken u name it i tried it and just changed the seasonings.. i wish u could just smell it coming from the oven while it bakes.. my husband can litterally smell it out the door b4 he walks in. we both love it. it is so easy (of course he doesn't know that;) he thinks it's a special occasion when i make it. the crust it makes on whole chicken legs (with skin) OMG.. TO DIE FOR! I AM NOT KIDDING! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TRY IT MY WAY.. if u regret it i will buy u new chicken.. ok well not really but u get my drift.. (p.s. i never use the foil i bake on a cookie sheet lined with foil) happy baking! (and seriously i was joking about the whole buying a chicken thing.. just to be clear) LOL!

After reading the ingrediants in this recipe I had mixed thoughts "perhaps they left out a few things or..." Well it was so wierd I had to try it... I just took it out of the oven took the least enjoyable piece for my taste (a leg ) and ran to the computer to "rate 'n rave"... The only thing I added was a little Mrs.Dash reg. seasoning... All I can say is if you fail making this go to the colonel's and stay out of the kitchen. I'm looking forward to making this for the next church pot luck dinner... Mmmmmmm... What a blessing this will be...

Pros: It was VERY simple to make and I had all the ingredients. Cons: It didn't modify well to chicken breasts that I had cut up. My friend who I made it for said it was too dry and tasted kinda strange. Verdict: I may well try this again; but I will have to do some more modification. I am not an experienced cook and can't tell when it's getting dry just by looking through the oven door.

This meal is simple and tasty. I first made it for my man who likes his food simple and well cooked. No creams no crunchy no frills. He loved it! I then made it for my whole family when my father came home from the hospital.....now they want me to move back home and chain me to the kitchen!!! It's an easy and wonderfully tasty meal!!

Easy recipe and the chicken was very moist. I did add extra garlic salt and brown sugar per suggestions that I had read. My husband loved it I thought it needed more flavor so I ended up putting bbq sauce on my piece.

This is an excellent recipe! It was so simple to prepare and the result was delicious. The flavor was just right. I followed another reviewers recommendation and sprinkled the garlic salt generously on both sides and only used 1 teaspoon of brown sugar and it turned out excellent (I prepared one pound of chicken). My whole family loved this recipe! Thank you!

Great recipe for a beginner like me... and wonderful for the glycemic load diet! I halved the carbs by massaging some honey on the chicken instead of the brown sugar added some melted butter (as per others' recommendation) and also added a bit of ground peppercorns celery seeds and black sesame seeds. I also covered the dish with foil after 40 minutes. Serve with pan-fried shirataki noodles and your favorite green veggie and you have a winner of a dinner!

Super easy recipe to make!! I used boneless chicken and did lessen the cook time and covered the meat halfway through as recommended in some reviews for boneless. Still think I cooked it too long (8 small pieces at 350 for 40 minutes) as was a tad dry. I will make again as both my son and husband said it was good (I agree) so that is a HUGE plus in this house!! Did not taste the garlic or brown sugar (I used light brown) as strong flavors.......just a very nice mix.

This recipe was so fast and easy to make. A great recipe for a beginner to get their feet wet! I didn't have garlic salt on hand so I just put garlic powder on the chicken and then salted it. Worked out just fine.

Okay I took advice from previous reviews and added more garlic salt (2 tsp). Next time I will rub the chicken with th garlic salt and let it chill then I'll shake in the brown sugar:) This is a very good dish and thought it wouldn't be. Just delicious. The garlic flavor drips off when the sugar melts:)

This was good. I used chicken breasts and baked them for about 30-40 min at 350 degrees in a convection oven. I threw some baby asparagus in there with a few minutes left. I followed others suggestions and added some butter and just sprinkled garlic powder (I didn't have garlic salt) salt on both sides and brown sugar on top without measuring. Very easy I'm sure I'll make this again.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make! I patted brown sugar and garlic salt on both sides of chicken tenderloins placed them in a 2qt dish put generous pats of butter on top cooked for 15 minutes then covered for the rest of cook time. I served it with white rice. The chicken came out soooooo tender the combination of garlic and brown sugar is yummy. Thank you for such an easy recipe that everyone enjoyed!!

I can't believe this isn't 5 stars. Extremely easy moist and good. Just make sure you use liberal amounts of brown sugar on both sides and be sure and cover with foil after baking for 40 minutes. The brown sugar carmelizes and gives it an excellent flavor. For those of you that are worried that it will come out tasting like a spoonful of sugar you can lay your worries aside. It tastes a little sweet but it is perfect. I have made this several times and everyone loves it.

Finally a chicken recipe that I can't mess up! I was looking for something easy and this is it. I had three boneless chicken breasts and I used them......pounded them down sprinked the garlic salt on both sides and put plenty of brown sugar on both side of the chicken as well. I place in a casserole dish that was sprayed with Pam. Only cooked for 45 mins. My husband liked right away!! I am not the best cook..but this is one that I will make again!

I added ginger to the mix. Everyone loved the oriental flavour. Served with Singapore noodles. Another time I would line the pan with foil or use a disposable pan because it is sticky but worth the scrubbing.

My family liked this. I used frozen boneless skinless ckn breast and browned them in a skillet on the stove first sprinkling with the garlic salt occasionally. Then put them in a casserole dish coated with melted butter and sprinkled the brown sugar over each piece covered with foil and baked for 45 minutes. Very good.

I love how this turned out!!!! I was afraid that the brown sugar would make it too sweet but it wasn't at all! I was pretty liberal with the garlic powder added some season salt pepper and towards the end drizzled a lil evoo cause it was lookin a lil dry. But it turned out soooo juicy and the flavors were great all together! Oh and I baked at 425 for 30 minutes! Thanks for sharing!

I used skinless chicken breast and I didn't have any garlic salt. Instead I used garlic powder w/ parsley in it. I didn't go by the measurements what was said b/c I know you always have to double the sauce if you want extra. I had put a little too much garlic powder but you couldn't tell when you ate it!!:-) Your house may smell like it though!!:-D I doused the chicken with brown sugar. the inside of the chicken was a little dry. So the second time I made it b/c my kids wanted it again I cut slits into the chicken breasts and put the brown sugar on top and added a little water into the pan so it wouldn't stick. Out of curousity my son said to me to try honey..so right before the chicken was done I added some honey and WOW!!! The flavor it brought out in the chicken!!:-) By putting some water into the pan created some juice and that goes GREAT over rice!!!:-)

This was good chicken!! I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt because that was all I had. I also like others did not measure. We like a stronger garlic taste so next time I might try some minced garlic in the dish as well as the garlic salt/powder. Overall excellent and easy to make!

This recipe was good. I used dark brown sugar and garlic powder which is stronger than garlic salt. It gave a great blended taste of both ingredients. So I coated the chicken on both sides with garlic powder and dark brown sugar and put it all into the crock pot with a little butter on the bottom. Will be making it again.

This is very yummy! My kiddos (ages 1 7 and 9) LOVED it and asked for seconds. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because although very tender I thought it was a bit dry. I added olive oil before seasoning and covered after about 40 minutes as other had suggested. I will absolutely make this again... next time I will either cover sooner or try in a crock pot. I did not measure seasoning... just covered liberally. Its excellent.

This is really fast and tasty. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and instead of garlic salt used seasoned salt. I also sprinkled on some paprika as well and it was a hit. Love this for nights when I just don't know what to cook. This is really good on pork chops as well. The only thing is I like to brown my chicken up a little bit first.

I too did not use the measurements. I cooked the chicken skin-down for the first 30 minutes and then flipped it over and basted it with its own juices. It was very flavorful and a simple way to bake chicken.

This is incredible chicken I have made it for my family many times and made for a friend in mourning. Their family loved it too. I sometimes drizzle a bit of syrup on it if I am low on brown sugar and it comes out really good.

Great recipe! I was looking for a marinade plain chicken is boring. This was perfect. I marinated the chicken while it was defrosting overnight then put it in a pan with onions and poured the remaining marinade over the top. I cooked in the oven at 375 till almost overdone. It was fall apart delicious!

Yum Yum! So like the others I thought it would be a little bit weird but it's actually delicious. The flavor reminds me of either b.b.q. chicken or a soy sauce marinade. But it's much simplier and you don't have to marinade for hours. (I hate that) Simple and delicioso...my favorite!

This is a very good and easy way to do "chicken-in-the-oven". I had bone-in split chicken breasts that had been skinned. Drizzled the meat with melted butter sprinkled on a GarlicSalt-Pepper grind blend then sprinkled lightly with the brown sugar. Baked at 350 in a glass baking dish for 1 hour (didn't need foil). It was extremely moist with a lightly seasoned background flavor. I will be making this again. Maybe next time trying different spice blends.

I read the reviews and was careful to add a lot of garlic and salt. I also used white pepper and cayenne. I coated each piece on both sides with liberal amts of all 4 seasonings then patted brown sugar on both sides. It was not the least bit "hot" but blended harmoniously with the sweetness. I used fresh carrots and baked them with the chicken. Served with a couscous pilaf (with frozen peas) and a side of mandarin oranges from a can the sweet and savory combination was great. Prep time was only a few moments and looked pretty too. I think this basic chicken recipe could be spiced up with an array of imaginative seasonings or sides. I can't wait to try it with a peanut satay sauce or a coconut terriaki! Loved it!

I didn't really follow the recipe amounts I just used my eye. I listened to the advice of using more garlic...I seasoned both sides of the chicken drumsticks and then sprinkled generously with brown sugar. Halfway through I turned the chicken and sprinkled a little more brown sugar on each. It turned out really well. I think that I used just enough garlic to offset the sweetness of the sugar. We will definitely use this again...it was too quick and easy not to!!

The chicken tasted good but nothing too special. You don't taste the brown sugar unless you eat the skin and we're healthnuts so we take that off. So it was good but nothing I'd make regularily. Thanks though!

Awesome easy recipe! I didnt measure ingredients either just applied by eye. I covered it halfway through. When it came out of the oven my husband thought it looked bland and asked if I did anything to it. But he was very surprised when he tasted it and commented how delicious it was we all loved it! It was very moist and flavorful will make again!

This was very nice my family liked it very much (half of it was gone before I got it to the table). A little more garlic and brown sugar would provide an even more intense flavor along with a little salt to make it pop. But this will be a new staple in my dinner repertoire.

This sounded so amazing and had such great reviews but I was disappointed. Maybe I did something wrong as I am not a very experienced cook and usually follow recipes exactly. This time I did what other reviewers suggested and didn't measure but just sprinkled. I was cooking for one so I only had one chicken breast. It was also boneless and skinless and maybe this doesn't work well without the yummy fat. I also added butter as some suggested because I was afraid it would be dry without some "liquid". I didn't have garlic salt just garlic powder so I added a little salt. It is such a simple recipe and it sounds like just putting some brown sugar garlic powder salt and butter on both sides should have turned out just fine like everyone else's but it had this very strange almost bitter taste that I couldn't quite get used to. I ate about half of it and then gave up. Maybe I just put way too much garlic powder on for one chicken breast... Any suggestions? I really want to try this again.

I made this in a skillet and it was so quick and good! I'm sure the crust on the chicken is different if you bake it. I cooked the chicken breats (cut in half) on med high for about 7 mins per side then removed from pan when it was done. I used the extra juices and sugar in the pan to boil down into a sweet thick sauce to pour over the chicken. The kids and adults loved it!! I suggest trying this!

No one in our family really cared for this. However after reading other reviews I did not measure the garlic salt or brown sugar so maybe there is a perfect balance and I missed it. Either way our vote is to skip this next time.

I melted some butter (as suggested by some) & threw it in the mix. When the chicken got too salty I just added a packet of Splenda to neutralize the saltiness. Thawed chicken breasts. 400 degrees. 25 minutes did the trick. It was a splendid meal. Different in taste. But got a kudos from my consumers.:D

We had all been under the weather at out house and I was looking for something that would be quick easy and appatizing. This was AWESOME!!!! I did add a little water to the bottom of the baking dish to prevent it from getting dry and then we just put that on top of the chicken when we were eating it. I also added half of a small schallot diced up for some extra flavor. My kids and husband loved it.

to enhance this try using your favorite steak rub with the brown sugar. wash your chicken real good but leave it wet when u season it. let it sit for an hour and it will create a sauce and almost marinade the chicken. cook on a lower heat 300 fore 1 1/2 hours. if u have a rotisserie it's even better. this is not the quick way but u should taste the difference. wow!!!!!

We enjoyed this! Like many others we did not measure the garlic salt or brown sugar - just sprinkled liberally with both. Bf and I agreed that next time we will do the same thing but add a little plain garlic powder as well. The salty/sweet ratio was excellent but we were hoping for more garlic flavor. The skin texture was a bit odd but looked and tasted great. For two leg quarters we baked for 1 hour and it was perfect. This one will definitely be a repeat just because we always have all 3 ingredients on hand. Quick and easy!

I make Sunday dinner every week for the family to invite my sons' their girlfriends and my grandbabies over to eat. I made this last night for everyone (9 people in all) and the reviews were "it is awesome" "it is really good" & "that's a keeper". It was super easy. The only thing I did differently was continue to put garlic salt on top when I turned the chicken over. Very good!

Like many I first wasn't sure about the mixture of garlic salt & brown sugar but it turned out so good.

Oh MAN!!! This stuff is SOOO good!!Wonderful wonderful recipe!!!!! Instead of following the recipe to the T I boiled the chicken first for safety measures and then baked it just to get the brown sugar and garilc to form a sort of crust over the skin. I severd it with whole wheat noodles. Boy oh boy did it hit the spot!!! Thanks ALOT!!!

Ignored measurements temp and cooking time; HOWEVER it was amazing. I really do think this recipe is foolproof. I cooked very slowly covered with foil for 90% of the time. Added a little butter since I use skinless boneless breasts. My 80 year old parents loved it. I shredded it when it was done to soak up all juices in the pan. Would definitely make it again!

We enjoyed this chicken - it was super easy to make and tasty. I added just a bit more garlic salt (to salt the other side of the chicken pieces) but used the called-for amt. of brown sugar. The chicken wasn't gourmet of course but everyone liked it and I will definitely make it again. Thanks!

This turned out great! I did have some issues with the cooking time but I am positive that it was because my oven seal is broken and the heat take a lot longer. I will deffinetly make this again.

Absolutely delicious!! I didn't have any garlic salt so I used Season All (has salt pepper celery seed nutmeg onion garlic etc.) I just sprinkled the salt and brown sugar on to taste. About 5 minutes before it was done I added a bit more brown sugar since we all have a sweet tooth. Everyone loved it including the very picky 12 year old. About 40-45 minutes cooking time for boneless/skinless pieces is long enough. Very moist and very tasty. The best part...so easy!! Like many others I was skeptical but you just have to try it. Next time I'll use the garlic salt.

I used very large chicken breast. I like the dark meat better & will use that next time. The breast were too dry for me but the flavor was great! It was so easy. Even my very picky daughter liked it! Can't wait to make it again!

I made this tonight and it was a definite hit. Everyone loved and raved about it. Simple and delicious. I did not measure the garlic salt or the brown sugar and I added garlic powder all suggestions I read in other reviews. I will add this to my favorite recipes file. Thanks for sharing.

This chicken really was incredible--and so easy!! I think the tips people added about using the seasonings liberally and using just a bit of butter were key. I will be sending this to others to use too!

I love recipes like this!!! So easy but good. Sometimes it's great to not have to make an effort to make dinner but still make something homemade. This fits the bill.Everyone in my family liked this. The brown sugar makes the skin crisp. thank you!!

This may be my all-time favorite recipe from this site--and it's not just because it's SO easy (though it is!). It's just plain delicious with the right blend of salt garlic and brown sugar to be interesting. My whole family likes it--and (now) makes it!

For my family this was just okay but with so few ingredients and such quick and easy preparation I can't say I wouldn't make it again. I may try tossing some onions and green bell peppers in next time.

This is truly the ultimate recipe for busy people who still want a hot delicious homemade dinner at the end of the day. It couldn't be simpler but I was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful it tasted. The salty sweet combination makes it anything but ordinary chicken. LOVE it.

This has been sitting in my recipe box forever so I finally decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did! Like other reviewers I didn't measure at all I started out with melted butter on the chicken and liberally sprinkled the garlic salt on both sides with some pepper and then topped each with some brown sugar. I also covered it up the last 15 minutes or so and it turned out perfect. I'm always looking for recipes that use what I already have on hand and this is definitely a keeper for an easy but delicious dinner.

3 1/2 stars I guess. It was a nice change from the usual chicken spices but I'm not sure if I'd make it again. I couldn't keep the brown sugar on with the butter that others had recommended it would slide off. The one photo in the recipe looks like another darker ingredient was added like pepper?

It's pretty much failsafe (though my husband overdid the brown sugar last time) so easy and everyone seems to like it especially the kidlets. We have recently put it back on rotation.
