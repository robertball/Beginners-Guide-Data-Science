Wow!  What a great combination of flavors.  I've been eating this for weeks now, and I'm not tired of it yet.  The only thing I changed was to use a rotisserie chicken in the wrap, instead of cooking the chicken.  Still spectacular!  Thank you for this tasty, healthy recipe.

Great master recipe for any deluxe gourmet honey mustard wrap!  I used it today for a honey mustard ham wrap and the green onions and toasted almonds made it taste great and have great texture.  I am coeliac so I used a GF wrap and chopped honey ham.

The flavors and texture were outstanding!  I didn't even add the bacon and it was still fantastic!!  I did cheat and use chicken strips from the deli. The whole family loved it!

Delicious!  Used chicken thighs instead of breasts,  seasoned the chicken instead of the panko, perfect.  Not sold on the almond slices, doesnâ€™t seem to fit.
