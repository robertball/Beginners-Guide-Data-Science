I almost never make major changes to a recipe before I make it "as is" first.  So after making this exactly as written once (and it was very good!), these are the changes that I made to make it even more healthy.  

I used yukon gold potatoes (leaving peel on) because I found the russte to be a bit mealy.  I used 1 Tbls butter, 1 1/2 Tbls organic EVOO (a healthier fat).  I also used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the milk, this made it extra creamy.  Just before I added the cheese to the sauce, I put in a minced clove of garlic and a couple dashes of hot sauce.  

The changes were made because of my families personal tastes but this is the way we make them all the time now.

Very tasty.  I liked the lowfat alternative.  You really didn't miss the high fat ingredients at all.

My husband and I made it today for Christmas dinner. It was more than fabulous. I too used fat free milk as others did and thought it turned out just fine. I always use no-salt butter. Not too cheesy and greasy just perfect. The onions were a nice touch since the hubby LOVES onion.  Two thumbs up!!!!!!

These potatoes were  wonderful. A great way to save some calories. I used instant nonfat dry milk since that is all I had on hand. If I make this dish again, I would use a little less onion and chop the onion instead of slicing the onion. I also would reserve some of the cheese for the top and sprinkle paprika for color. During the last 10-15 minutes I would uncover the potatoes so the top browns nicely.

I made this recipe as stated except I used skim milk.  The potatoes were still yummy and creamy. Everyone loved the dish and it's a great make-ahead recipe.

I made this recipe even more Healthier. Instead of low-fat (1%) milk I used instead non-dairy creamer not powder and you must use a non-flavor creamer. It makes it so creamer and it tastes better. With your potatoes LEACH them, which means to soak the starch out for about 3 hour's or longer it's better. Try using salt free seasoning or flavored and yes they have low Phosphorus their out there and let's not forget a little Garlic Powder. I love cheese even low fat but I did find a non-dairy cheese and I know what your going to say. YUCK!!! I did find a cheese and it's called Daiya (DAAYA) and many restaurant's use this cheese and you didn't even know it. HA! Instead of real butter use margarine instead or a Healthier Brand.

This was very good except I can't believe nobody else mentioned the 1-quart baking dish.  You have almost four cups of liquid, plus all of the potatoes and onions going into a 1-quart space.  Doesn't work.  I used a 2-quart baking dish and it worked perfectly, giving everything room to cook evenly.  Also, it was a bit bland, so I added a little garlic powder to the mix and it gave it just enough flavor.  This turned out great.

My husband loved this, didn't notice it was low fat at all.  The only thing I changed was to omit the onions because I don't like them, and it turned out great.

This was a huge hit with my family!  I used 2% milk because that's all I had.  All other ingredients, bake time the same.  Super creamy and delicious, this will definitely be in our regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

delicious! My MIL wanted scalloped potatoes with a meal and was gonna get the boxed kind. I don't know about you but I have terrible memories of the boxed scalloped potatoes growing up. I hated them. so I found this recipe and made it instead. I did make some changes as I chose this one for its simplicity. I used half and half instead of 2% as another reviewer suggested it, and on a whim I added a couple of slices of chopped bacon (cause bacon and cheesy potatoes are a match made in heaven) everyone loved it! I'm gonna have to double the recipe next time!

Merry Christmas!

I made this recipe today for Christmas. It was easy to follow, didn't take too long to prepare, and DELICIOUS! (I posted a photo before I baked it.)

When I tasted it for the first time, I said, "OMG, THE POTATOES ARE AMAZING!!" (Funny thing, I ate it alongside a steamed lobster tail.) 

My Husband agreed with my exclamation. I told him that this recipe is going to be made more often for certain. Also, I have added it to my menu as a new, Family Tradition...it's THAT amazingly delicious!

I'm enjoying some now and posted a photo of it in my bowl. 

Thanks so much for this AWESOME RECIPE!!

Warmest regards,
Tricia Manns

Just decided to try this recipe tonight.  Of course I didn't read it through and didn't have the 1 1/2 hours to have it cook.  After I had the sliced potatoes and onions in the glass baking dish, I microwaved for 7 minutes while I made the sauce.  I then baked the finished dish about 1 hour.  They came out perfect.  My entire family loved them!

My sauce didn't thicken up in the saucepan just right - maybe because I used 1 1/2 tbsp of the butter with 2 cups skim milk.  After 45 minutes in the oven, it was still soupy so I panicked and dumped in 1/3 parmesan.  And stirred.  (Don't stir!  It breaks up the potatoes!)  I took it out at the end of the 90 minutes as directed, and after standing a few minutes, it was fine.   So I should have just left well enough alone.  Delicious dish!

I wanted another "go to" side dish recipe for those times I am asked to "bring something" and this looked good.  I made it basically as is, though when I changed the amounts to alter the servings, I mistakenly calculated the milk wrong so mine came out a bit dry.  I followed other reviews' suggestions and minced the onion.  I also took the sliced potatoes and minced onion, and mixed them together with the salt and pepper before adding the cheese sauce.  Added a dash of garlic powder, but this was still bland...not sure what it needs....maybe fresh rosemary?  I will probably try it again and see if I can liven up the flavor, it's worth another shot.

I made a double batch of this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! I did not make the skinny version however I used whole milk and regular Sharp cheddar cheese. I also added a half teaspoon of garlic to the milk mixture before adding the cheese for extra flavor and topped with dried parsley flakes. I also upped the temperature to 425 for the last 15 minutes of baking and removed the foil to brown it up a bit.

These potatoes were very tasty, followed the recipe as the recipe descripted, but I halved the recipe.  The crème sauce was very good, the reason I gave it a 4 was because the sauce was not as creamy and thin as I would have liked.  I will use this recipe again but will make the sauce thinner.

We made this but added broccoli and ham to make a complete meal (casserole) and more cheese- I will however double the cheese sauce next time but it is a great recipe and not hard to make.

Mmmm. I'm no fan of cheese but I gave this a try and loved how it came out. Only difference is I used heavy cream instead of milk because it's what I had on hand.

I made this recipe on Easter and it was a big hit.  I used whole milk and regular cheddar cheese because that's what I had on hand.  Also, I added a dash of nutmeg and cayenne pepper to the cheese sauce because I think it enhances the flavors.  Everyone loved it and my husband was happy we had some left over for another night.

Definitely would add more onions, although the original recipe is delicious. All our guests raved about them. We've avoided so much fat in our foods that this lowfat recipe didn't really seem low fat.

My husband loves Potatoes....so that this quick and easy recipe was better than I hoped for was the real bonus!  I made the potatoes thinner than the 1/4 inch and cut the cooking time down by 15 minutes.  They were so good!  Will keep this one on the menu for years to come!

Really very good!!! Unfortunately I could not find reduced fat cheddar at my grocery store (only fat free and we do not like the taste of fat free) so this was not as healthy as it should have been. I did sub a 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese for a 1/2 cup of the cheddar. I followed another reviewers advice and used fat free half and half, which did make it extremely creamy!  I also only used about 1/4 cup chopped sweet onions, as my husband is not a huge fan of onions. Next time I may try caramelizing sliced onions prior to adding as I think that would add a great depth of flavor, and I love caramelized onions ;) . But these potatoes were very tasty! I'm having leftovers today!

The recipe was wonderful but I did make some adjustments.  First, I added cubed ham steak as well as onion and garlic powder (instead of onions).  I also added a serving of bouillion because instead of baking it I used the pressure cooker.  It was PERFECT!

Very easy recipe and was a big hit with the family. I diced the onions only because members of my family don't like big pieces of onion. I also sprinkled a little Mozzarella cheese in between the potato layers for an added flavor. Will definitely make this again.

Fantastic recipe! We used rather large potatoes and 1 quart was definitely not enough haha. We actually ended up using a 2 quart pan and that was barely enough, but she fit! Absolutely loved this recipe, especially with some Tobasco sprinkled on top!

AMAZING! Still pretty high calories for a "healthy" variation, but every bite was worth the calories!

I used a cup of fat free evaporated milk (just because I had a can open and needed to use it) and the rest 1% milk as called for. I also used red potatoes home grown from our garden instead of russets. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It was delicious! My husband & I both loved it-and I'll make it again. Lower fat, less guilt but still very yummy.

I made this vegan with Earth Balance, Daiya shreds, and soy milk. I added lots of fresh garlic instead of onions because that's what I had at home. It was great and I will definitely made this again.

This recipe was very good. My husband likes his potatoes plain but he commented on how much he liked the recipe. Tasty and reduced fat- thank you! No need for any changes at all!

Very Good, used my food processor to slice potatoes and grate the old cheese, the rest was easy, I salted & peppered each layer and threw in a pinch of rosemary as well in each layer.  Put rosemary in the sauce also, it turned out wonderful, well worth the wait!

Very nice.  I used already baked potatoes, since in my experience that is always what takes forever, left out the onion, and added in Montreal Steak Seasoning.  This is a delicious au gratin and I'm not entirely certain it's healthy even with the modifications, but it's okay to indulge every once in a while.  We enjoyed this one, and I used skim milk since that's all we buy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out good, would have a liked it a little more cheesy- may try the "less healthy" version next time.
