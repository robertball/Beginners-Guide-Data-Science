This soup was very good although very labor intensive. To cut down on the work involved with the raw pumpkin I cut it into pieces and baked it as directed in the recipe "Cooked Pumpkin" from this website. It was then very easy to remove the skin and dice the pumpkin. I also only added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. The soup was very creamy and smooth even with the skim milk that I used.

This was lovely! I loved the spiciness of the cayenne with the pumpkin and nutmeg. I did make this recipe vegan by substituting vegetable stock for chicken broth and soy milk for the milk. I found I also only had to use 2 cups soy milk instead of the 4 1/2 cups of milk the recipe called for. I followed another reviewers suggestion and pre-cooked the pumpkin. Worked like a charm. I will definitely make this again!

Was very good but perhaps a bit too spicy. I will make it again with less cayenne next time.

This is awesome soup. I added 1 tsp kosher salt and I also precooked the pumpkin. I used the chicken broth as the liquid and omitted the milk. One thing I would personally change is that I used the whole leeks and the soup turned green from the tops. Tastes great but looks like Pea soup instead of pumpkin.

Wow! I didn't think onions and pumpkin would compliment each other so well. I did so many things wrong to this recipe and it still came out SO delicious. Accidentally applied too much heat too soon when adding the milk... I have no cayenne pepper (which is probably a good thing - I don't like spicy food)... and I added too much nutmeg so that taste was a little over whelming. I absolutely recommend this recipe (I've already emailed it to friends and family). I do not think it was too much work. One thing I suggest is to add the spices to your own liking. I made cornbread to go along with this meal - so good!

Wonderfully tasty and comforting on a cold night--the leeks really add to the flavor. I made a few alterations including using already cooked pumpkin hot paprika and to use them up leftover half and half and sour cream in place of the milk. Ended up with a very thick warming dish that I certainly plan to make again especially since there seem to be so few good pumpkin recipes that don't involve baking.

Spices were way too overwhelming. I tried adding more pumpkin and milk to try to cut the spices down but it was still too overpowering. Just a waste of pumpkin and milk. This might be a good soup. If I feel adventurous I might make it again with at least half the spices.
