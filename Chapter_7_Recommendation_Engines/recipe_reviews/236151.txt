So, definitely 5 stars.  The flavor was perfect for a true Mexican breakfast.  So perfect in fact, that no one added salsa.  I made a few alterations -- used 1.5 cans dried green chiles instead of 2 and 1 tsp chili powder.  And, instead of fresh cilantro, I used Knorr's dried cube cilantro, which worked great for flavoring and didn't leave little green leafy things in the casserole.  The only drawback was the preparation time -- it took a lot of time and I sure hoped the recipe would be worth it.  Surprise!  It was totally worth it!  It set up perfectly w/in the cooking time (and for high altitude that's awesome).  The teenagers LOVED it.  Thanks, Johnsonville, once again a new family favorite.

I halved this recipe and served it for dinner with a little sour cream on the side.  We thought it was very tasty, and I'd definitely make it again.  I used a whole 7 oz can of diced green chiles for the half recipe, and the chips I used were the nacho cheese tortilla chips from Trader Joe's.  I used the original breakfast sausage from Johnsonville, and even though it does contain MSG, I did not get a headache or retain water from it---a very happy result!  Thanks for a good dinner, Johnsonville!

This comes together really well, & even cut in half!  (There's only 3 of us).  However!!!  You MUST give it plenty of time to "set up" after...no matter how much your mouth begs to just dip in!!!  If you serve it too soon it will be all soupy & goopy.  Ask me how I know !!!  HTH!

This reminds me of something I ate for breakfast in Mexico.  While I don't think it is too much work I can't see my family eating it for breakfast, mid day brunch or dinner is more likely.  We had it this evening.  I prepped everything earlier in the day and refrigerated it until ready to bake.  It was very well received, even by a picky 4 yr old.  Once again Johnsonville scores well in our house.

We enjoyed this recipe made with Johnsonville breakfast sausage. Like other cooks, I halved the recipe as it's just the two of us, however, unlike others that found it too loose, we found that my casserole was a bit dry. A dollop of sour cream worked for the first meal. On a reheat, it just became drier. Would I make this again? Yes, I will with some small changes. Nobody beats the quality of Johnsonville sausage. P.S. Sorry, no picture. My dear husband accidently deleted it from the camera.

This is a great recipe.  I couldn't find a Johnsonville turkey breakfast sausage so used another brand of turkey breakfast sausage and it was great!

This came out great. I did omit the chiles due to an allergy. It did need a little extra cook time but that may be because of the pan I used. The sausage was a standout in this recipe.

The next time you go out for Mexican food, take some tortilla chips home and bake this casserole for breakfast the next morning. I love the flavors of Mexican food, and this quick and easy egg dish is absolutely magnifico. Especially made with Johnsonville Sausage. Ole!

This recipe was really good! I halved the recipe because there's only 3 of us here. There is a lot of prep work and it's not easy to just throw together, but it was worth it in the end. Even my 2 year old ate this! I didn't have pepper jack cheese, so I just added 1/2 an jalape√±o minced with cheddar. I also added more salt and pepper.

Made again and again. Used chicken this time and red sweet peppers as I had no green Chilis.   Added paprika and used heavy whipping cream as I ran out of milk.  Rich but amazing.

This recipe was good. When I cut into the casserole it was soupy, and the meal didn't want to stay together. The taste was great, I will make this again in my future.

Very good - served to 10 and they all liked it and wanted the recipe.  Might add a little more hot sauce next time.  It seemed like a lot of milk to the number of eggs, but it did set up in 50 minutes as stated.

This dish seems to have a lot of protein which is good for active middle aged women.  Plus, it seems to have all of the ingredients that I normally carry in my refrigerator so that cuts on costs that I would normally spend to prepare dishes that require a lot of ingredients that we have to go to the store to buy special for that recipe.

I made this for my coworkers when it was my turn to bring breakfast for our weekly meeting. My boss doesn't like sausage so I used about 1 1/2 lbs of ground turkey. Fried it up with a generous amount of Tex Mex seasoning, some chili powder, garlic powder, sea salt and a couple of splashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce. Didn't want to make it too spicy at the time so you could always jazz it up more. And I used multigrain tortilla chips as we love them more than the regular corn ones. Otherwise followed the recipe . It was a hit with everyone. Absolutely delicious!

This does not need the salt. It is plenty salty with the chips, sausage and cheese. I served it for brunch for 9 people and have about a third left over. I will make this again.

This recipe is a good start, and it will deliver a solid breakfast meal. The first time I made it, I wasn't crazy about the sausage as it felt more classic American than Mexican. So, the second time around, I swapped out the sausage for some Johnsonville chorizo, which hit the spot. Also consider adding some taco seasoning to increase the Mexican flavor.
