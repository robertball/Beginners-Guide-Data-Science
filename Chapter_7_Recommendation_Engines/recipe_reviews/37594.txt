This is one of those recipes that takes stuff pre-packaged in the box to the next level. The use of veleveeta cheese seems to make the difference. This recipes is quick, inexpensive and best of all can be cooked in a single pot for easy clean-up. Don't snub your nose at this one kitchen gourmets - you can add any combo of fresh chopped vegetables you choose. I recommend adding some sweet onion!

This is really great for how simple it is.  I used Kraft Velveeta Light Shells and Cheese and cooked according to package.  I microwaved my package of broccoli, cauliflower, a carrots frozen mix.  Then mixed all 3 together.  I will add chestnuts next time for some crunch.  This made a great lunch and didn't taste so much like a traditional tuna casserole.
