I followed the directions exactly. It was very dry. The cheese sauce itself was perfect if only using half the amount of elbow macaroni. Next time I will double the cheese sauce ingredients for a full size casserole or only use half the amount of elbow Mac for a half casserole size. I do think this recipe will be smooth and creamy with the right Mac mix. The cheese sauce method is great to use with many other recipes also.

Delicious basic recipe! Even my picky fiancé loved it. I added extra cheese as I do with everything - also added appx 1 tbsp of prepared mustard, 3/4 tsp garlic ( I love garlic) and 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to give the flavour a little added zip - it was an excellent addition. Also sprinkled breadcrumbs on top and broiled it at the end for about 3 mins to add a crispy crunchy top - it was a hit!

it dried out soooo fast. don't get me wrong, it was good, but i guess my expectations of creamy macaroni were too high.

Best mac and cheese I've ever had! I am not a fan of spicy food so I did not put the cayenne pepper in it.  Also, I added bread crumbs to the top before I put it in the oven which gave it a touch of crunch when eating. Will definitely make again!

Delicious I made it and the fam loved it, I used a different type of noodles and a different cheese and instead of half and half I used sour cream I think that made it a bit better!!

Other cooks reported it dry so I added 1/2 cup chicken broth and it was great. Used a little more cayenne and black pepper per my individual taste.

Very good recipe! I'm hard to please with mac and cheese. I added a little Velveeta to the mix as well as a 1/4 tsp. of onion powder. I also put a bread crumb topping on. Velvety smooth sauce with just the right kick, not too oily or bland. Will be using again!

This recipe was delicious.  I was very proud of how delicious it came out.  I’ll definitely save this recipe & make this again.  I did use a house blend instead of regular salt & pepper to add some extra flavor.

This is the Mac n cheese I dreamed of.  Amazing as is, or basic enough to tailor to your taste.  Easy to make, my 15 year old son helped. When it was finished baking we broiled it for about 10-15 to add a crispiness to the top. We tripled the recipe . Used a whole box of macaroni.

It was an easy recipe to follow. It came out well but trying to reheat it in the oven dried it out too much unfortunately. I’ll know not to reheat it that way next time.

This is delish! I made 1/2 the pasta and almost the entire sauce hence the 4 instead of 5 star. It’s a perfect Mac n cheese with double the sauce. I used herbed butter and and habanero jack

I made add just as the recipe said only instead of using half-and-half or use regular milk and put a total of a cup and a half then I added half as much more cheese and some leftover white cheese case so I had.they probably would've came out just as good without the case up at the case or made a really super creamy excellent recipe

The only ingredient omitted was the cayenne pepper. Followed directions and we definitely enjoyed it. Although I can see why some reviewers said it wasn't creamy enough. Personally we didn't mind the consistency of it but next time I make it I'll make a bit more cream sauce. The taste was good and it's not that expensive of a tasty side dish to my baked chicken!

I really enjoyed this.    I did put some butter on top as suggested.     I didn't think it was dry.   Will make again.

I made this tonight,  but I added half pound of bacon, and I couldn't find Colby cheese, so I replaced all the cheese with a whole brick of velveeta, and 1/2 cup of shredded Old Cheddar for the upper crust. Also next time I'd use 1/2 as much Cayenne, as the bite might be just too much for sensitive pallets.
