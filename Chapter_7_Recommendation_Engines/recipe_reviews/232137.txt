I thought this was alright. It was definitely no match for real smoked brisket and the depth of flavor. I bought the brisket at a whole sale club, so I just doubled the recipe as it fit in my crock pot. Make sure to have large containers of paprika, pepper, or other flavorings as it uses quite a lot. I am pretty certain it will all be eaten, but think I will go back to real smoked meat.

Very good, very easy.   I've always wrapped my brisket in foil to make it in the crockpot. This recipe is great. I cooked mine o n low for nearly 8 hrs. The family really liked it. We did try to use the sauce from the drippings but too fatty to be good. Perhaps a good chill first?  Will definitely do this again.

The rub is quite versatile! I added a bit more liquid smoke to the sauce and used Sweet Baby Ray's Original. Cooked on HIGH for 5 hours (1-1/2 lb. brisket) till fork-tender. To the juices I whisked in 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup apple butter and reduced by half over medium heat on the stovetop. Delicious!

Ive made this twice and really enjoy this recipe.  It had a decent smokiness to It and was good to set and forget. The rub It's phenomenal.  I must repeat myself here, the rub Is so good... I made it the first time with regular paprika and It turned out great. The second time I substituted half of the (regular) paprika with chipotle powder. Add some additional liquid smoke to give you some smokiness if you use regular paprika in lieu of smoked.

MUCH TOO SALTY.   I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. Cut the spices at least in half or plan on a SUPER SALTY meal!

Extremely easy recipe. It was very good. I used a 2.85 Lb brisket, but there was enough rub in the origial recipe to cover it. I upped the onion to a whole one, because we like cooked onion. And i put it under the brisket, instead of on top. However, I don't think I'm a cumin person. So next time, I'll either reduce, or remove it from the rub.

This came out delicious! I used a 2 lb brisket and left out the cumin (I don't care for its flavor).  I also trimmed the fat off before putting the spices on. My crock pot cooks fast and hot (unfortunately) so it only took mine 5 hours and it was falling apart and moist. I added some extra Worcestershire sauce right before serving. Absolutely delicious and will definitely make again!!

this is an awesome easy recipe.  I followed it to the exact recipe and it turned out nice and tender.  I used Kraft Honey BBQ sauce.  I only wished I would have cooked the whole 4 pound brisket.  I am doing the other half later in the week.  It is so full of flavor and is fork tender.  Yummm!!!!

Ive made this twice now - second time, which was today, I used a chuck roast instead of a beef brisket. Everyone loved it.  I use the rub as follows - I just make sure I spread it all over the meat and let it sit a little bit while I get everything else ready. I don't force myself to use all the rub, just enough to coat the meat. Also, a note about the rub - Ive been using it to make salad dressing. I make a batch of it - store it in a glass jar and use it as needed. To make salad dressing I pour a little in a small glass jar - maybe 1 tsp and then I add about 2-3 tbsp olive oil and 1.5 - 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar and a little squish of honey. If I don't use it all on my lunch salad I bring the leftover home and add more to the jar the next day for lunch. Just an FYI - it makes an Amazing salad dressing!!

I made this last weekend for a family party and it was gone in a minute! I cut the amount of salt and liquid smoke in half and didn't really need the full amount of the rest of the spices to adequately cover a 3 pound brisket. I trimmed some of the fat, pierced the roast all over, and then marinated it in the dry rub overnight. I'll make this again!

Wow, thought this was awesome!!  I did follow some of the other posters' comments and added a lot less Kosher salt and less chili powder.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Only thing was did not have as much time to marinate/cook.  Will try this again soon and allow more time to marinate and cook on low.

used a 3.5 lb brisket but did't double amount of spice rub - was enough to cover entire amount of meat.  Used 1 whole onion, but could've used 2 onions!  Will definitely make again!

This was very quick and easy to make!  I did NOT get a chance to marinate it, I went to the store in the AM and put it in the slow cooker before work, let it go for 12 hours, and it was still full of flavor and delicious.  I saw a review saying this was salty, I followed the recipe's measurements and my boyfriend (who is normally opposed to salty food) loved it and had no problem!

Delicious! However, I only needed half the spices to coat meat. I used Sonny's BBQ sauce and didn't add any water. Only marinated for 1 hour. Will definitely be making this in future since it's easy and so tasty.

Didn't care for this--no match for the grill slow cooked method. I did not add any water-the slow cooker method is watery enough. It was too salty...and the sauce was too watery for us. I won't use this again.

Absolutely delicious! I bought some brisket points from Aldi and used them to make this recipe. It ripped apart like butter and tasted delicious! Highly recommended!

The one thing I would say is that the recipe makes way too much of the rub. I had nearly 2 tablespoons worth left over.

Just doesn’t stand up to the real smoked brisket that I am used to eating. Meat gets sort of stringy and seasoning is a little too much. Made only one change - used less cumin.  Will not make again.

Super tender. I also cut off the fat before hand. Loved the rub. I used a 3 pound brisket and did not add more to the rub recipe. I seared my meat on both sides, let it cool, used the rub and put it in a zip lock bag in the refrigerator overnight. The next day super easy to make. Made the barbecue portion of the recipe. Cooked in the crockpot on low for six hours. Tender beyond believe. Tasted perfect. Not too salty for me not too hot either, perfect.

Simple and delicious!!  One note - my crockpot has time settings instead of temperature. I chose the 8 hour setting, to have a lower temperature, but then only cooked it for 5 1/2 hours. My brisket was a little over 2lbs. Came out perfect!! No knife required!!

Before placing in slow cooker I got the outside nice and crispy on the stove. Definey helps get more flavor. Next time I would reduce the amount of cumin . Omit water and add a tablespoon of cider vinegar and some garlic. 
I  used a chuck roast instead of brisket and reduced the cooking time.

I really enjoyed making this and eating it! My hubby and I also enjoy smoking meat and this was right up there with smoking successes we've had using the same meat. Followed recipe exactly and was concerned it was go to be too spicy for my taste but it was simply fabulous!  Thanks for sharing it! -SLangston

Decent flavor.  Agree with comments on rub. Halve the rub for a 1.5 lb brisket. I cooked a 3 lb and it was borderline too much. I have had better brisket out of oven. Probably will not make again.

So I had my heart set on making this but when I got to our grocery store there was no brisket available. Actually there wasn’t a heck of a lot of choices in the beef section. I bought some Beef country style ribs. Removed the one bone that was still attached and prepared exactly as written (I did leave the rub on overnight). Excellent!! Can’t wait to try with an actual brisket, but the seasoning and sauce that it makes is tasty with other cuts of beef.

I made this exactly as written. I used Rufus Teague Honey Sweet sauce. It's not my favorite, but it's what I had on hand.  The reason I gave it a three is because it was far too peppery for my mouth and my taste.  I couldn't even finish one serving of it.  I'm going to try adding sugar to the rest of it and see if I can make it palatable for me.  I also would have preferred a smokier taste. If I use this recipe again I will add twice as much smoke flavoring.  Over all it was easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand, which was convenient.

I didn't have any smoked paprika or liquid smoke in the house but it turned out great anyway.  I did use some seasoning salt in the rub which contains paprika and salt.

One of the best things I’ve made in my slow cooker!

Used a 3 lb brisket. Plenty of rub for that if you follow the recipe. 

Salt can be cut back, and I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.  

Did not add water at all, but added chopped celery and carrots, they provided enough moisture for  a sauce.

This was simple and easy to make, turned out tender, but not falling apart. My only suggestion is make sure you enjoy the cumin flavour , as it is an acquired taste and somewhat overpowering.

The whole family loved it.  I read the notes, and adjusted the recipe a little.  Did not add the Cumin, and was low on paprika so substituted the rest with a chipotle seasoning i had on hand.  We used this amazing BBQ sauce that we had purchased at a food fair.   But without the bbq - the meat was delicious!!  Thank you for everyone's input, this is definitely a keeper.

I thought this recipe was good.  It had a great flavor, but as with any meat dish in a slow cooker you don't know how it will turn out until its done. A little dry, but slow cook meat usually turns out like that. Will try again, but will change cook time.

This recipe does not need 3 Tbs of chili powder. It totally overpowers the taste of the meat.
Next time I'll use 1/3 amount of chili powder and double the amount of brown sugar.
