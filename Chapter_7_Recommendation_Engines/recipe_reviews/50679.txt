I made this cheesecake and took second place in a baking contest.  I divided the filling into three separate bowls with about 1 2/3 cups in each one.  Each bowl was a different flavor.  After the cheesecake had cooled and was ready to serve, I melted 3 squares of semisweet chocolate with 2 Tablespoons of butter and 1 teaspoon of shortening,  Cool for 2 minutes and pour over the cake letting it drip a little over the sides.  Melt 1/2 ounce of white chocolate with 1 tsp shortening and drizzle over the glaze.  That seemed to change the cheesecake from looking a little drab to one for a special occasion.

The steps were quite simple, it just took extra time to clean out my mixer bowl with each flavor. Not bad, but probably wouldn't make it again. It did come out rather flat, so others may want to try it in an 8" springform instead of a 9", rather than doubling the recipe.

This recipe was fairly easy to prepare.  I will suggest that if you want to have consistent levels of the three layers, you should put the strawberry on top because it is a little thinner than the others.  This cheesecake was delicious(nothing like regular cake as far as I am concerned).

This is a very rich cheesecake and it takes a lot of work.  It turned out lovely. I topped it with melted dark chocolate.  Next time, I may try to double the white chocolate layer and serve with fresh chocolate dipped strawberries.

I made this along with a plain New York cheesecake for a friend's promotion celebration at work. Everyone loved the New York, and this one went over well, too, but I thought the chocolate crust with the dark chocolate layer sort of overpowered the strawberry and white chocolate. Next time I make it (which will be soon, trust me!) I'll try either a shortbread or a graham cracker crust.

Delicious and not as hard to make as it looks.  The layers are very thin, though.  The next time I'm going to try doubling them...

Not my favorite cheesecake, but it was very good.  With so many great cheesecake recipes, they cannot all be a favorite, right?

Great recipe!  Such a great combination of chocolate, white chocolate and strawberry.  This was also a good order to layer them in.  Used 8 inch pan as recommended which made the layers look good.  Friends and family approved.

I recieved rave reviews when I served this cheesecake.  I gave it four star because it didn't look very appealing.

It was too hard to make and it turned out like a cake instead of a cheesecake.
