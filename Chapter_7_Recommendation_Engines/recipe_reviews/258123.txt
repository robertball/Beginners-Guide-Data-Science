Wow this salad is almost like a dessert! The sweetness of the peach and the tang of tomato really blend so well. The basil adds an additional layer of flavor and is always delicious with peaches. I changed the dressing to a raspberry vinegarette that was a good option and reduced calories since I did not use oil.

Pretty good result.  Absolutely requires great tomatoes, which turned this into a 4*'s instead of the 5 it would have achieved.  Used ripe peaches to good effect, but will likely try to use the jarred mangoes I used in a steak recipe earlier.  Used avocadoes and a great olive oil.

So easy and delicious! Never thought about adding peaches and tomatoes together but it sure does work. Great flavors and a definite keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

This is an awesome summer salad. It screams summer with peaches, tomatoes, basil, mozzarella. I added avocado because I had one to use up. I wasnâ€™t sure about having the sweetness of peaches with everything else but it really adds to the whole salad.

Absolutely make it again.  Changed slightly.  I used a balsamic reduction.  No oil.  No salt.  I stacked a large tomato slice, large fresh mozzarella slice, fresh basil leaf, a slice of peach, another basil leaf and a large toothpick through it all.  Great presentation.  The peach was perfect intaste.  Drizzled balsamic reduction ove the stack just before serving.  Looked more like the traditional caprese salad.

I sliced the tomatoes too thin. It  was hard to have everything
stay neat like picture.  But all liked salad. Used a dark syrupy
balsamic vinegar.  Also did again with nectaries andwas just as good.

Fantastic salad! Only change I made was white fleshed nectarines instead of peaches since my stepson has issues with textures. Everyone loved it!

I made this exactly as written except for the 8 oz. of cheese.  I don't know if it was the size of my fruit, but 8 oz. just seeemed like a bit too much. So I cut the amount down a bit. It was still very good.
