Great recipe! I followed another suggestion and reduced the amount of water to 7 cups. In addition, I added 6 pieces of bacon, cooked and crumbled, to the soup when I added the sliced Velveeta. I'll be making this soup again!

Followed this one exactly and my only complaint is that the Velveeta never completely melted but by the time it did enough to eat, the potatos were overdone. Next time I would add more potatos so that it will be a bit more chunky. Second bowl in I added some cumin and liked it even better. Paprika, chives, and crutons for garnish. Thanks!

Didn't really care for this at our house.  It taste more like potato soup than cheese soup and I won't make again.

OOOh so very good!  Really this should be titled as a potato cheese soup - but whatever it is, it's wonderful, quick and easy to make.  Using red potatoes, I have made this exactly as the recipe suggested with a just bit of sharp cheddar on top and another time, added venison sausage - both times were great.  This does not have the "canned" taste I was expecting.  I like to mash the potato cubes just enough to "roughen" them up - the addition of the soup and cheese give plenty of creaminess without having to mash up the potatoes too much.  Thanks so much to the contributor! On to my second helping....

I made 1/2 recipe of this to try it out, and I am glad I did! This was very boring tasting. I thought it was strange to go through the work of making homemade potato soup and then adding a can of soup. The canned soup dominated the flavor and it ended up tasting like "canned cheese potato soup!"

This was fairly quick and very easy!  It reminds me of the cheese soup at one my favorite restaurants. Wonderful on a cold night!

Very easy to make and delicious.  My 11 year old picky eater loved it.  I added cooked cubed potatoes at the end to make it a more hearty soup.

This tasted great and was pretty easy to make.   I was almost done making it when I found out I didn't have the condensed soup.  I added a little sour cream instead and it tasted wonderful!

I thought this was quite tasty.  I did things a bit differently because of what was available at the store and I only made two servings.  I'd suggest if making single servings the following proportions:  1 slice thick cut deli bacon (cook for two minutes in microwave then cut into pieces and add to soup pan).  Finely chop 1/2 celery stalk and 1/4 small yellow onion.  Add to pan with bacon and cook for a few minutes.  Add 1 cup water and 4-5 oz diced potato (I used Yukon gold).  Bring to a boil and then simmer 10 minutes.  Using a fork smoosh most of the potato pieces.  Add 1/2 tspn Better than Boullion, 4 turns of a pepper grinder, 1/4-1/3 can of cream of chicken soup with herbs and whisk until smooth.  Add 3-4 oz processed cheddar cheese (I like velveeta but cheddar was on sale).  Stir until melted.  Serve immediately.  Was very tasty with bread for dipping. Be sure you use processed cheese as it will melt better.

Delicious! I made a few changes based on the reviews and my personal taste. Used 7 cups of water; left the potato peels on and only slightly mashed them.

I've taken far more time to prepare recipes that weren't half as good.  The cheese flavor is just about right.  Because I had some chicken broth to use up, I used 7 cups of water and 1 cup of chicken broth.  I used a cheap, store-brand of chicken soup and still this recipe tasted high-ticket.

I work at a school and made this soup for the kids salad bar and they enjoyed it. I found it to thin for potato soup so I thickened it with instant mashed potatoes and worked great.

This cheesy potato soup had an awesome flavor!  I, too, cut back the water to 7 cups and it was still a little runny.  Next time, I will add broccoli and more potatoes to thicken it up a little.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Terrific potato soup, but not enough cheese flavor to call it cheese soup.  I will use a little less water next time for a thicker texture and may add some bacon, too.

This was SUPERB.  Based on other reviews, and I wanted a thick soup, I used SIX cups of liquid - 2 cups of broth and 4 cups of water.  Next time I think I'll put a little more potato.  I used 4 brown potatoes that come in the bag (not quite full size baking ones) and I think 5 would be better.  I also did not mash the potatoes until the cheese and soup were in and smooth, because I was afraid they would get too mushy, and that worked perfectly.  I don't like celery so I used a mixture of white and green onion...seems perfect to me!  I served it with a little bacon bits and fresh green onion to rave reviews from my dinner guests.  Also, I don't know why anyone would slice Velveeta...I cubed it and it melted quickly and easily.  Will certainly be making this again! I might throw in some shredded chicken next time for a one pot meal.
