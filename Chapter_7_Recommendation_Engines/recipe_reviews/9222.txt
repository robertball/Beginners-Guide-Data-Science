I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving last week and it was awesome. I used 5 large sweet potatoes, peeled and boiled, so the casserole would not be dessert-sweet (and so I'd have more leftovers!). It was the perfect flavor. The pecan topping provides a great crunch. I'll be making this every year!!

A wonderful receipe.  I made this for Thanksgiving and my mother-in-law made her version.  My recipe won hands down (not that I am counting :)  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the evaporated milk.  The only thing I would change would to put it in a larger dish so I could double the recipe for the topping because people really liked that part of it.  The family thought it was the best recipe for sweet potatoes ever!

i have been making this type of sweet potatoes for a long time; love it love it. i however use a lot less sugar, maybe 1/3 cup st most, sometimes don't use the milk, and sprinkle a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg on top before putting on the topping. yummy yummy.

This is soooo good! My family said it is sinfully good. I think next year I will cut down on the sugar a bit, maybe by a 1/4 cup and will add some cinnamon and nutmeg but it is absolutely wonderful as is.

This recipe was awsome. I only used half of the amount of white and brown sugar and it came out perfect.  A must serve dish for holidays.

This was a great recipe.  I did modify it just a bit and added a little bit (3 tablespoons) of Grand Marnier to the recipe which gave it a nice rich flavor and I also mixed some coconut in with the topping.  I brought it to a work potluck and everyone is asking me for the recipe.

I prepared this for Thanksgiving and it was very yummy. I think I would add a bit more evaporated milk, maybe 1/4-1/2 cup more--it was not as moist as I would have preferred.

This is the best sweet potato casserole recipe here!  I have used this recipe for the last 3 years, and every year I have to keep making more and more.  I have yet to find anyone who didn't like it.

A new family favorite!  We make it for every holiday and special events.  Even my brother-in-law who hates sweet potato casserole loves this recipe.  I have made it with the full sugar - and with 1/2 the sugar and would say that it is good either way.  You would have to decide how sweet you want it.  If you make it with the full sugar it will end up tasting like a dessert and not a dish that goes with dinner.  You choose - it doesn't matter with this recipe because it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good either way.

This was really easy to put together and can actually be made ahead up to the point of the topping and refrigerated.  My family loved it - especially nice change from the usual marshmallows.

I used 2 29 oz cans of sweet potatoes, drained and mashed them, then followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It turned out great! A big hit with everyone!

Delicious tasting. I tried one of the recipes using canned sweet potatoes, but this is superior. A little more work, but well worth it. Everybody wanted this recipe!

Me and my mother-in-law have been making this recipe for years and we always get great reviews. All the sweet potato recipes I have looked at are basically the same with maybe and item added or deleted. My mother-in-law and I always make this recipe in advance and freeze them. It's great as a desert or along with a meal.

This is it. For always and forever, this is going to be the sweet potato casserole around our home! Off the charts, five stars simply doesn't do it justice.

Made a couple of minor changes:

1.  Used canned yams, drained.
2.  Used a lot less sugar, because of the canned yams.  I started out with a 1/3 cup and kept adding for taste.
3.  Used unwhipped whipping cream as I forgot to get evaporated milk. Worked fabulously.
4.  Before putting on pecan streusel, dusted the top with cinnamon.  
5.  Made even more topping, as suggested by others.

These changes were more about what I had in the house, rather than any problem with the recipe.

Thanksgiving guests went wild over it.  

Look no more, this is THE recipe for holiday meals!  Thanks for sharing it!

I made this from three fresh sweet potatoes. I roasted them with olive oil, salt, pepper, white sugar and some allspice @ 425  for about 30 Minutes.  Roasting sweet potatoes this way was good enough to eat. I think I am going to make these for a special dinner for my anniversary...I'll let you know how it goes.

I wasn't real thrilled with these, but others at the party really liked them  I thought they were too sweet.  Would I make them again?  Yes, just becasue others liked them.  But if it's just for my family, then no.

Absolutely the best SWEET potato casserole ever.  I serve it at potlucks all the time and people rave over it every time.  The only thing I do different is add coconut to the topping.  If you have a sweet tooth, this is the recipe you want.  Enjoy, happy holidays to you!

I don't personally care for sweet potatoes, but my family does. I made this dish last year at Thanksgiving for the first time and everyone loved it. They say it tastes just like a dessert. I have made it for every occassion you could think of since and it always a big hit.

This has recipe has become a holiday staple for my family. I was looking for a good non-marshmallow version and this is it! I started making it last year for Thanksgiving, made it again for Xmas (per hubby's ardent request) and will do so again this year. I think 'as is' for  me would be too sweet so I cut the white sugar way back - to about 1/3 cup and its perfection. Can't take a star off for that being that its sooooooo good and If super sweet is your thing go with a cup!

I'll be honest...I wasn't expecting much with this recipe but WOW....we ate this for during Thanksgiving dinner and I was officially assigned to make this for Christmas lol. This recipe is FANTASTIC! I especially like the sugar topping, gives it a nice sweet crunch. The only thing I changed (and it was a matter of personal preference) was that I added about 2/3 more evaporated milk. I also added marshmallows on top just for a nice look. Highly recommend, this one is a keeper!

I customized this but that was mostly just tweaking so I gave the recipe 4 stars since it was a great starting place.  I used one 29oz can of sweet potatoes. I put them in the microwave for about a minute and then mashed them up. I cut the white sugar to 1/3c and used 1/2 stick butter. And I used skim milk. For the topping I used the other 1/2 stick of butter. And I put the whole thing into pie plate instead of a 9x13. My boyfriend and I liked it with these modifications but we thought the topping was a little too sweet. Next time I'll cut the brown sugar to 1/2 c.

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the advice of others and cut back on the sugar in the potatoes- they were already very sweet.  The crunchy topping is fantastic, even if its not glamorous looking!  Thanks for sharing.

My mother-in-law made this recipe for Thanksgiving and I couldn't stop eating it!  Yesterday I made it for company and they used words like: delicious, wonderful and amazing to describe it while they were eating! My husband (who claims to be allergic to all vegetables:) tried it and went back for thirds!

This is much like a typical sweet potato casserole that I would make.  Yes it is very sweet, but you come to expect that from a dish such as this.  I did make this dish sugar free by using Splenda and Spenda brown sugar as well as heavy cream for the dairy.  This is a recipe I will be saving.

Awesome.  My DH who is hard to please and hates anything that "looks" like a casserole loved this.  I was looking for something different to have as a side dish and this really did hit the spot.  I didn't put as much brown sugar as the recipe called for (I didn't cut back much just went a little lighter) and it was delicious.  Still a little sweet but not in a bad way.  We are keeping this recipe for sure!

I love this casserole! I make it every Thanksgiving. I double the topping because that's what makes this so good. My dad and two cousins HATE sweet potatoes and they're the ones who ask for this each year. When I make a lot to have for leftovers, I add an extra egg to keep it moist for longer in the fridge.

I've used this recipe before. It's been around for a while. Cut back on the sugars unless you want people to tell you that it tastes like dessert and not a side dish. I gave a 5 star because kids will eat it this way but it's not really good to have all the sugars for the kids either. Very good with a little cinnamon and nutmeg mixed with the potatoes.

I used reviewer's suggestion of 1/2 cup of sugar.  It was perfect for our tastes!  I also cut back on the sweet topping amount.  The eggs, milk, butter made it creamy and a dash of nutmeg enhanced the flavor.  We loved it.

Pretty easy and came out great. Kids and adults loved it.  I need 15 more minutesin the oven.. not sure why.  I think if the sweet potatoes taste very sweet when you mash them you can cut down on the sugar a bit.  This dish is super sweet .  The nutty topping and brown sugar make it almost taste like a desert.  A winner for Thanksgiving.

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner last year and it was a BIG hit. Made exactly as written, no changes and it was delicious. It was sweet enough to serve as a desert, to be honest, but at Thanksgiving, who cares? I'll be making this again this year, for sure.

I used canned, drained yams and halved the amount of white sugar added.  It was excellent and very easy.

I made this for Thanksgiving and the one's that did try it raved about it; except my Dad (he does not like new things). This did not taste like Sweet Potatoes- for anyone that does not Sweet Potatoes. I used half the sugars and it was way too sweet, next time I will use a little less sugar.

Very good! I added 1 t. of nutmeg and 1 t. of cin, for a little more flavor. I increased milk to 1/2 C, for extra creaminess.  Also, I really like the 'crunch' on top, so I increased those ingredients by 50%. This was a Thanksgiving hit, and requested for Christmas! Yes!

My girlfriends and I were not originally planning on making this but after the sweet potatoes were boiled too long to make candied yams we decided we could not just throw them away. So we stumbled upon this recipe and let me tell you it was the best thing at the dinner table. It goes to show you that sometimes the best things happen accidentally.

This was a good recipe, but I have had better for sweet potatoe casserole.  I only used 1/2 the amount of white sugar and for us that was PLENTY.  As well, I will probably add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg to the mixture next time.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

Good change from other sweet potato recipes, BUT way too sweet. This would be a good treat to follow up a tour of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! I cut the sugar in half, like other reviewers had recommended. I STILL found it to be too sweet. Next time I will cut it down to a 1/4 of what the recipe calls for the sugar...

Perfect with a few changes! I cut the sugar and butter by at least half - still plenty sweet! I also used skim milk. This is delicious hot and cold - nice to send in the kid's lunch!

So very, very good! The only changes I made was to add some cinnamon to both the sweet potato mixture and the topping, and I left out the pecans because I didn't have any. The whole family loved it, and the leftovers were great for breakfast the next morning!

This was tasty but it was so sugary it actually cruched. Because of that, it didn't go over too well with the healh concious people I was serving at dinner, kind of embarassing.
IF I make it again, I am going to cut WAY down on the sugar.   It made a pretty presentationfor the table and would have been tasty without all the sugar.  Also, it was super easy to make that's why I gave it 4 stars.

This recipe is wonderful!  I used soft butter for a crumbled topping instead of the melted and substituted Bisquick for the flour.  A sprinkle of cinnamon adds a nice touch as well!  This was a hit at Thanksgiving today!

This basically tastes like pie, too sweet for every day meals but delicious for a special occasion. Ever since I brought it to Thanksgiving dinner about 8 years ago, I've been assigned to bring it every year and according to family "it's not Thanksgiving without it". In more recent years I have cut the sugar in half and it still tastes great, no one has seemed to notice the change!

This was easy to make and I did like it. I should have listened to some of the other reviews though and cut back on the sugar at little. It was very very sweet. It tasted like a dessert more than a side dish. So next time I make it, and there will be a next time, I will try with less sugar.

Very tasty!  I cut the sugar, butter, and pecans down quite a bit and it was still delicious.  I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg and then a few marshmallows on top.

My sister made this at Thanksgiving and I had to do it for Christmas I loved it so much. This is the best sweet potato casserole!  Even my husband, who has a strong dislike of sweet potatoes, loved it.

Every year I'm in charge of the yams for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I'm always looking for the perfect recipe, this is the one! Everyone loved this casserole, there were no leftovers and I made double the recipe. My search is over I'll use this recipe every year! I put a few marshmallows on top of the topping and browned them just for looks. Thank you for the recipe.

OMG - DELICIOUS!!!  Everyone loved it.  Great alternative to the marshmallow option.  Loved the fact that it was different, and it was simply delicious.  Great reviews all around!

Make this every year for Thanksgiving, it's always requested and every bit of it gets eaten. Even people who swear they don't like sweet potatoes LOVE this.

I made this exactly as stated. I don't like sweet potatoes but my husband and son love this so that is why the 5 stars. Very easy too.

This was the absolute BEST sweet potato casserole I have ever had.  I cut back on the sugar and butter little, and the brown sugar on the topping, and only used 1 egg and it was still fluffy and packed with sweet potato flavor. This is the only recipe I'll ever use.

I never liked sweet potatoes until I had these. LOVE them!!  I did cut sugar back to 1/2 as some other reviewers suggested. I put pecans only on half. Kids dont like nuts. Just wonderful!  Reheats fine.

I was looking for a recipe like the one my mom used to make.  This one wasn't exactly it, but still pretty good.  My only disappointment was that it was a little bit soupier than I like.

I use yams instead of sweet potatoes, they are not the same thing and I prefer yams. Yams are naturally very sweet so when using yams, cut the sugar down by adding 1/4 cup at a time to taste. Sweet potatoes are not as sweet as yams so more sugar should be used. This dish is always a big hit for the holidays.

This was super easy to make. I added a 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and almost a full tsp. of cinnamon. I didn't have pecans, but I did have slivered almonds, so I subbed those in the topping. I made no other changes. I was able to spread the casserole in a circular baking dish, there wouldn't have been enough to spread in a 9x13 unless you spread it super thin. I'll update this once my family tries it. EDITED: Super yummy but really rich and sweet. If I were to make this again, I'd cut back on both sugars a bit and actually use pecans. This is a stellar dessert, just a bit sweet. This is better as a dessert, not part of a dinner. I might even serve it with cream next time, to cut the sweet.

This is a great dish. I made my regular sweet potato dish and then used the "leftovers" or the mushy parts I didn't use in my main dish. It was better than I expected, everyone raved. Now, I will only make this dish.

I actually made this recipe twice this past Thanksgiving and will be making it again this Christmas by high demand.  The only thing I would suggest is adding an extra potato or two or not so much sugar or vanilla.  I did that the second time around and it was fantastic. I also barely mashed the potato. more or less just mixed a little.  It's a texture thing with me.

I made this recipe this past Thanksgiving for the first time, and it was super great! I took it to a family gathering and everyone had second servings, or third. The only change: I used Splenda instead of white sugar. Fabulous!

Very good and everyone really liked.  I also made changes based on other reviews and added only about 1/4 c. sugar to taste.  I did not want it overly sweet or dessert like.  Instead of evaporated milk, I used half and half.

Totally awesome recipe.  I prepared this side dish for my son's 16th birthday party.  It was a tremendous hit, especially with the men!!! One thing I added though was some pumpkin spice and cinnamon sprinkled to the topping. This dish is almost dessert worthy.  Thanks for sharing :)

LOVE IT!  I have been looking for a recipie that was similar to a casserole I had a catered dinner, and this was just like it.  I did leave out the nuts though because I am not a big fan of them and I have a relative who is allergic.  This is my favorite and will be at my Thanksgiving every year!

I was a bit skeptical at first, my family is so used to eating candied yams, but this was very good!

It turned out awesome! I used less white sugar, about 1/3 cup. Looking at the reviews I decided a cup might be too much.

I have tried finding a recipe like the ones my aunt made, without any luck. This is it!  I add a little more nuts and a little more potato than what is listed and they are perfect!!

I’ve made this 5 thanksgivings in a row, it’s delicious, especially with the crunchy pecan topping! My changes: only use 1/2 the sugar for both the filling and topping, otherwise it’s soooo sweet. Use fresh baked sweet potatoes instead of canned, and just a splash of evaporated milk, otherwise the potatoes are too wet and thin. Double the topping so it fully covers the top of the potatoes and more yummy crunch!

I made some changes based on reviews and it was excellent. I made at least a double batch (6 very large sweet potatoes) and didn't measure. I used about 25% less butter and I meant to cut the sugar in half because people said it was too sweet, but I forgot it all together! It didn't need it! I added a bit of salt and orange juice. For the topping I made it as directed with the addition of some old fashioned oats. I ended up making 50% more because it looked like it needed it (thank goodness, since I forgot the sugar in the potatoes). I would definitely make it again.

I made this for our church"s Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a great success. There was a small portion left for me to take home; which I ate for my breakfast. I am planning on using it for the Christmas dinner as well.

We usually only do marshamallows on our sweet potatoes but I didn't have any marshmallows today so I thought I would try this recipe. We aren't fans of pecans but actually loved the crunch they gave this recipe! My husband surprised me by saying we had to make these again! Thanks for a great recipe! I made one slight change - I added some cinnamon to the sweet potato mixture. Delicious!

This turned out so good. Easy and really tasty. The consistency was perfect, not too soft (aka runny), but still nice and creamy. I didn't really measure the cups of mashed sweet potatoes because I boiled several large ones and it was easier to mash them in the pot, then mix in everything else before transferring to the pan... this way I didn't have to dirty as many things. The topping, at first I was skeptical it was finished correctly, but it was delicious. Also, I made this the night before Thanksgiving and it was great heated up the next day...  I just served it onto our plates and then microwaved it... but we are not very strict here :p

This is a wonderful base recipe, although it required some tweaking.  As other reviews said, it is wise to cut down the sugar.  I baked my mix in an 8x8 with not quite 1/4 C. white sugar, half the butter and used corn starch for egg replacement.  I cut the topping in half also (less surface area on an 8x8) and added the remaining half of the evaporated milk.  I did add mini marshmallows.  I roasted my potatoes in the oven with coriander and cinnamon before mashing, that will probably make a difference.

I have a hubby that's  not so easy to please but he loved this recipe. This is really good and easy to make. I also used 1/2 of the sugar and it was just right. I will be making it again this time for my mother-in-law to taste it at Thanksgiving.

I am required to bring this every year for Thanksgiving.  Like others, I skip the white sugar and I also use canned yams or sweet potatoes.  I just rinse them thoroughly to get rid of the syrup.

I followed this as is and we really enjoyed it. Only thing I changed was to half the brown sugar for the topping because of others' reviews that it was too sweet. This was a good idea because with this change it was still really sweet but delicious.

The orange was a nice touch.  I used 1/8 c. sugar in the potatoes, but left the full amount of brown sugar.  If I make it again, the brown sugar will be cut to about 1/2c. tops.

As the only vegetarian I know who doesn't like sweet potatoes, it was time I branched out and this recipe was awesome!  With a light fluffy texture and crunchy nuts, the flavors combined perfectly.  Definitely a new holiday tradition.

Amazing!  Followed the recipe as is.  Super sweet and delicious. =)  Not so good for leftovers though... doesn't heat up to the same consistency.  I don't even really like sweet potatoes but these are to die for!

Great recipe, well received. I ran out of the 'topping' though, only covered about 3/4 of the casserole.

We love this!  I, our children & my father-in-law do not like sweet potatoes.  I made this for Thanksgiving and will do so again for Christmas.  The only suggestion my husband had was to cut back on the topping (pecans, brown sugar, butter)as it was a little too much.

Very good recipe.  I didn't use quite as much butter as called for and it was still very good.  Topping was great, very candy-like.

This is a really good dish.  It pretty much tastes like candy.  That also means you can't eat much of it.  My 8 year old couldn't eat more than a couple of bites.  I put in 1 more cup of sweet potato and a little less than 1 cup of sugar.  If I make it again  I will cut down the sugar in the sweet potatoes and the topping.

I loved this recipe. However, I have fond memories of a crumb topping so instead of the flour I added crushed graham crackers. This is a new tradition to our thanksgiving dinner.

This is the best. I make it every year. Can't wait to make it again this year. 
The brown suger and pecan mixture is what makes it. I could it that all day long.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I am not a big fan of pecans, so I didn't put any topping on them and they were still fabulous.
