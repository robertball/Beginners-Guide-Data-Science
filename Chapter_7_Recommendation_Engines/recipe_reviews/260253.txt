This turned out pretty good. I used seasoned breadcrumbs to save myself some time but other than that I made as written. Step 1 is to preheat the oven but it is not necessary to do this first thing. You've got 40 minutes before your chicken is ready to fry and it doesn't take the oven long to reach 200. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.

Very salty for my taste.  Not sure if I over salted  in error or  because I let it marinate  for 45 minutes more than the recommended 30 min because of distraction. That said.. the chicken was moist and nicely browned.  Will try again paying better attention and cutting back a little on the salt shaker. Hoping for a better result on second try.

They were great & have already made it again. I am lucky my local butcher sells them already to go into the frying pan. Makes it that much easier. Love them.

Omg....the flavor was amazing. Total hit in our household! Going in the rotation. Quick question though... is there a trick to get the breading to stick to the chicken? No biggie, because we just scooped it up but if there is a tip Iâ€™d love to know it
