Yes I will make it again! My husband loved it!! Made during the Coronavirus shortage, so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (no crushed tomatoes in the stores); used Marie Callender cornbread mix, Jiffy all gone in stores. Spooned out  a cup of chili so that the cornbread mix would fit, and that reserve came in handy to chili-fy my husband’s 2nd serving. Super yummy & easy recipe.

Great recipe! The video is entertaining as heck for the commentary alone! I like my chili thicker, so I used less water. Other than that, it tasted too good to make any other changes!

Looks great! Could you do this in a Dutch oven as well?

I've made this twice now, the first time I followed the recipe exactly (awesome) and the next time I used slightly different ingredients due to shortages at our local grocery store during the whole COVID-19 panic buying apocalypse. I used the Gluten Free Corn Muffin Mix from Bob's Red Mill since the regular Jiffy mix was out of stock, and used regular sharp cheddar cheese. I just followed the instructions on the package of corn muffin mix and doubled the cheese since gluten free stuff tend to be drier. Crust tuned out moist and perfect. For the chili, I could only get regular diced tomatoes so I used two cans of that. This recipe is very forgiving and hard to mess up. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Chef John!

my girlfriends newest favorite. made it per the recipe and it is great. use lean (85 or 90%) or be prepared to ladle off some grease before putting it in the oven.  i too used the larger 8.5 oz iffy mix  and it turned out fine. another great recipe from chef john

Absolutely loved it Chef John! Just a slight alteration, I used vanilla custard instead of sour cream. Subtle difference but really ties the dish together :) looks like this nurse is showing the firemen how to do it now LOL

I made it just as the recipe called for, and I honestly think there was...too much cornbread in the chili to cornbread ratio?  Next time I will cut it back to one box worth...  otherwise it was fantastic!

Mmm, this one's a winner. Wonderful combo. My grocery store didn't have cornbread muffin mix, so I had to make my own ('basic corn muffins' on this site). I lowered the cayenne by 1/2, but it could have used a bit more for my tastes... always tricky! Chile was not at all watery, which is often a problem for casseroles.

I know if it’s Chef John’s recipe, it is good. When I made the chili, I tasted it and wasn’t loving it; however, when I baked it with the cornbread, all the flavors melded together and it was so fabulous!!! Cant wait to make again!!

There is a typo, I believe: I couldn't find 7.5oz Juffy corn muffin mix, only 8.5.  

The chili was missing...something. maybe my spices were smokey enough, or maybe next time I'll use smoked paprika....   

I might also try to add some sweet corn onto the chili, but that will definitely push it away from "chili" and more into a mexican/tex-mex style dish.    

I think I added too much cheese for my own preference, but it was still tasty.

I have been making Chili...forever....however, I have never thought to add this amazing topping of cornmeal. The only thing we changed was, no poblano  pepper and added a heaping tablespoon of sour cream to the topping mixture. So moist and all was delicious!
Thank -you Chef John...for this recipe that we will make many times over!

This was wonderful.  The cornbread topping really hits it out of the park.  I can't handle too much spice so I just used one tbsp of chilli and 2 tbsp of cumin and added cinnamon stick and bay leaf to my simmering pot.  This created a milder heat level but still full of flavour.  Delightful!  Also, I couldn't find corn muffin mix in the grocery store but it was easy enough to make with cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and vegetable oil.  Just google jiffy corn muffin copycat recipe.

Chef John did it again. I enjoy his recipes and videos! I made this one as written and it came out very yummy! The only change I made is I cooked and baked this in my large Dutch oven (6 qt). I’m a big fan of one-pot meals. This did lead to the cornbread being a little thicker and took about 5 extra minutes of baking time. Will definitely add this to my favorites!

Loved this. Will definitely be in regular rotation. I cut the salt and cayenne in half and it was still great. Missed where it called for how much cheese in the ingredient listing? I winged it and just sprinkled 3/4 cup cheddar on top at the end.
