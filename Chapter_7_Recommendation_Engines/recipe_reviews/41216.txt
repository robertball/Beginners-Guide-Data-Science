This recipe made very delicious and hearty wheat muffins.  They were a great after school snack for the kids.  I froze the rest and they were eaten in school lunches and for quick on-the-go breakfasts.  You can play around with this recipe to suit your whims.  Once I added finely chopped apples and cinnamon.  Another time I added ground flax seed.  I think I like it with the addition of cinnamon.  I like the fact that it has no oil but it still has a nice texture and they turn out moist and just yummy.  So play around with it if you want, or just enjoy it as is.

Really good recipe.  I also made some substitutions. I used 1.5 cup wheat flour and .5 cup white flour. I also substituted the white sugar for the brown sugar, the walnuts for almonds and the nutmeg for the cinnamon. I also cooked these as mini muffins for 10 minutes which was perfect.  It's a great breakfast and will be a great snack later.

My husband raves about these muffins!  (And I do, too!)  I can hardly believe how healthy they are, for how good they taste!  I did add cinnamon, because it is a favorite spice in this household, but I might try without next time.  I think for the texture it is important to go quickly from mixing the wet & dry, right into the oven - the leavening acts quickly, and you want them to be fluffy!  I will note - I had enough batter for more than 12 muffins using a bare pan (no liners), but only one pan, so I can't tell exactly how many it could have made.  Oh, one more thing (sorry so long!), I really enjoyed splitting a muffin open and putting a bit of peanut butter on it - match that with fruit for a great light meal!

These are really good.  I substituted craisins for the nuts but otherwise followed the recipe.  They are light and fluffy and very tasty.  I loved the nutmeg.

The flavor of these muffins is really good, but I am personally not crazy about the consistency.  If you are looking for a fluffier non-dense muffin, these may be for you.  I made only a few adjustments - used brown sugar instead of white because that's what I had - used a 1/2 cup of white flour and 1 1/2 cups of wheat.  Also added some cinnamon and shredded carrot,  and dried cherries in place of the nuts.  I would try this recipe again but maybe add some oatmeal or something to make them more dense.

Good muffins.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  They are tasty warm with a little butter :).

Love it!  I used soy milk, added fresh blueberries cuz I wanted some fruit, 1/8 cup water to make it a bit fluffier, and 1.5 c wheat flour and 1/2 c white flour.  I also didn't have nutmeg, so I used cinnamon.  So good!  Makes a little more than 12 muffins, probably more like 14 or 15.  Does taste somewhat wheaty with my variation, but I like it that way on a healthier note.

These muffins turned out chewy. I substituted 1/4c agave syrup for sugar and reduced milk accordingly to 3/4c. And it was coconut milk. The flavor is good, slightly sweet. Kids liked them.

These muffins were good for being entirely fat-free. (I used skim-milk and omitted the nuts) The only complaint I have is that they were a bit chewey, which I assume is from the yogurt. But again, they were very good and next time I think I will add cinnamon, allspice and cloves to make them "spice muffins".

These muffins were ok - a little too fluffy for my taste. I added raisins and left out the nutmeg, and they tasted fine.

I made the recipe and it turned out fantastic!!I didn't have a full cup of yoghurt available so added two tablespoons of vegetable oil. I also took 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 c of Ragi/millet flour. This increased the nutritional value of the muffins. My mother-in-law loved these as she is a diabetic and could not enjoy sweets without the guilt factor. Thank you so much for the recipe :)

I made the recipe using 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour and cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Good taste, though a little dense and a little chewy.  My 2yo liked them. Will likely make this again, though will likely try putting apples or something else in it.
