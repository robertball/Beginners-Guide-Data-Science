I've made this cake several times now, always to rave reviews. A few notes:
- I've tried Pillsbury Moist Supreme Butter Recipe Yellow cake mix, and both Duncan Hines Butter Recipe Golden and Pineapple cake mixes. The pineapple cake mix gave a stronger pineapple flavor (of course), but I got the best/moistest cake out of the Pillsbury mix.
- I've had good luck with Land o Lakes Baking Butter...otherwise I use the ultra creamy variety.
- **Try the coconut!** It doesn't taste like you think it will. It adds SO much to the flavor/look of the cake!
- It's sometimes hard to gauge the baking time with this one...the toothpick test can be deceiving. Just keep an eye on it.
- Another reviewer suggested this and I always do it because it WORKS...after layering the cakes, place the pan, upside-down, back onto the top layer. Remove it after about half an hour; this should take care of the cracking problem.

This was excellent!! I used a 9 x 13 glass pan put the pineapples, brown sugar, cherries, and butter on the bottom a little bit of the cake mix and then the crushed pineapple and the rest of the cake mix. I think it turned out awesome! Thanks alot

This would have been 5 star if I didnt tweek the 2nd time around. First off, Golden Butter Cake mix, instead of plain yellow changes this from being just ok, to incredible. The amount of liquid needed for Golden Butter is also the perfect amt. for what you get out of the pinapple cans. 2nd, the cooking time is way too long. I'd start checking this after 25 min, as over cooking is one of the main reasons it cracks/falls apart when taking out of the pans. I have yet to throw out any of the left-overs on this cake, as the whole thing ALWAYS gets eaten!

Great cake - my only complaint is that in the recipe instructions, it says to let the cake sit for 30 minutes after taking it out of the oven - BAD IDEA!  The topping stuck to the pan when it cooled, and I ruined both layers when I removed them from the pans.  It still tasted good, but didn't look all that pretty!

Very tasty, without being overly sweet.  I simplified and slightly modified the recipe:  Butter was increased to 1/2 cup.  I placed it in an ungreased 9x13 pan, and let it melt in the oven while the oven was heating.  Then, sprinkled the brown sugar, coconut, and a 20 oz can of drained crushed pineapple, and the drained marischino cherries over the melted butter.  (I didn't use the sliced pineapple).  When mixing the cake mix, I added 1/2 tsp. coconut extract, along with the pineapple juice.  The baking time was a bit longer, due to pan size... about 35 minutes.  The coconut extract flavor didn't "jump out", but gave the cake a nice, fresh, (not from a mix) taste.  I'll definitely make this again.

Great cake that tasted so much like my grandma's homemade one! I omitted the coconut because hers didn't have it, and it was just fine.  Be careful not to shake the layer with the pineapple slices when you remove it because it breaks the cake. Thanks for the recipe!

I love pineapple so I decided to make this and it was wonderful!  I took the advice of MomDad4Kiddies, and used a 9x13 pan.  I decided to leave the coconut out.  I layered the pineapples, brown sugar & cherries on the bottom, then half the cake mix, then crushed pineapple and last the rest of the cake mix.  Very easy to make and tasted great!  Thanks Donna.

This recipe is wonderful!!!  The first time I made it it was good, but not great.  The second time that I made it though, instead of a yellow cake box, I used the Butter Golden cake box.  It made all of the difference.  Also I use an extra couple of tablespoons of butter and brown sugar for the toppings.  I received so many compliments.  The cake vanished, presentation was also beautiful!!!  This is going to be a permanent staple in my recipe box!

I also used a yellow butter-recipe mix and it was moist and delicious.  But even though I only cooled it for 15 mins., the top had big, ugly cracks next to the pineapple slices because both layers were higher in the middle and sloped down on the sides.  This is usually the problem I have when I make a 2-layer cake.  How do I prevent this problem???  Please help!

This was a DELICIOUS CAKE!  IF anyone made this cake and didn't like it, then they did something VERY wrong in the cooking process!  Not only was this cake moist and full of flavor but it was so pretty when it came out!  I didn't do the double layer.  I used a regular oblong cake pan and baked it the traditional way.  My hubby loved this recipe too!

I made this cake for my boyfriend's 26th birthday and it was a HUGE hit!  I took the advice from several reviews and added some tweeks of my own and came out with an amazing cake.  I used the Duncan Hines Butter Recipe cake...my Mom swears by Duncan Hines and several other reviewers suggested butter cake mixes, so I got the best of both.  Instead of water or pineapple juice in the cake I used a 100% pineapple-coconut juice I found at my grocery store.  I doubled the amount of butter and brown sugar.  Before I took the cakes out of the pans I injected them with some reserved pineapple juice...not too much...just a few little squirts throughout each cake.  I took the cakes out of the pans after 10 minutes and had no cracking.  The bottom layer got hard with the coconut...I think if i had put the pinapple then the coconut I could have alleviated that problem.  The top layer came out perfectly.  I didn't like how the sides looked with it being a double layer and no frosting or anything...so I opted to make a homemade whipped cream w/some confectioner's sugar, coconut extract and drained crushed pineapple.  I spread that on the sides and dusted the sides with toasted coconut flakes that I also made.  It made for a beautiful presentation and a great complimentary flavor with the moist delicious cake.  This is definitely a winner!

This cake is extremely easy to make, and has always turned out delicious.  It's always very moist (thanks to the pineapple juice and slices) and is probably the best smelling cake you will every make. With the carmelized brown sugar and coconut, it doesn't need any other icing!  I've found that this cake recipe turns out much better in a bundt pan instead of two round pans.  There's not much point having two round layers of this cake as you do not put anything inbetween the layers.  Also if you use round cake pans, there is a tendency for the pineapple rings on the top to crack and fall apart.  This won't happen in a bundt pan.  Finally this cake definitely tastes better fresh out of the oven.  Unlike other cakes, it does not get better with age.  The caramelized brown sugar is hot and crunch out of the oven, but after a day or so, it is absorbed back into the cake and becomes less cruncy.  This cake is best eaten fresh out of the oven.

From the prensation of the cake it look very tasty.I did indeed had to cut a piece of this flavorful cake even though it's apart of my Husband father day gift.OK i didn't have alot of pineapple juice,so i used 1/2  cup pineapple juice and 1 cup sour cream.I didn't have any coconut so i just used the brown sugar. i used butter instead of oil I'm pretty sure i didn't used 1/4 butter so i just rub my pan with softened butter.And i used a bundt pan,I half the brown sugar and the pineapple.1st i put the brown sugar in the pan in then the pineapple ,I poured the batter over it and then i repeated the process.I also used a pinepple cake mix in i used 1 tsp of coconut extract.Since i didn't have any coconut this was a very moist cake and you can't tell it's a box cake Now that's what's happening

This has become a family favorite. Extra moist and delicious. I don't make it as a round layer cake, but rather use a 9x13 pan putting half the batter down over the pineapple and brown sugar, then sprinkle a layer of crushed pineapple followed by the rest of the cake batter.

Followed this recipe exactly, using Allison's recommendation on cake mix. I baked it in a 13x9 pan. Coated most of it with real butter, then sprayed butter flavor cooking spray in the corners. Layered the sliced pineapples. Next time I'll use 2 cans and have some left over for other uses. I filled in the gaps with extra cherries and spoonfuls of the crushed pineapple. At this point I remembered the coconut...so I layered it next, then about half the batter, then the rest of the the crushed, and then the rest of the batter. Baked for 40 minutes...golden brown and absolutely moist and delicious and perfect. I let it cool in the pan for about an hour, and it slid right out when I inverted it. Beautiful. Thank you!

I made this cake last weekend, and it was phenomenal!  Very light and fresh tasting, even after it's been in the refrigerator a couple days, and it was really minimal fuss to prepare.  I followed the recipe almost precisely, with the minor addition of diced cherry in the middle layer mixed w/ the crushed pineapple, and I used another reviewer's suggestion of Duncan Hines Butter Golden cake mix.  I shudder to think what the calorie count was, but it's worth it for a once-in-a-while treat, and in future editions I will experiment w/ some butter substitutes. The top layer did try to break in half when I stacked it, but I stuck some toothpicks in there and that fixed it right up.  

On a side note, and we'll just call this a hunch, if you don't have any round cake pans and get the bright idea to use two spring-form pans instead, be aware there's a chance the butter will drip through the pan to the bottom of the oven and create an entire house-full of thick smoke that is very unpleasant to air out in the middle of winter and your husband will be less than pleased at your baking prowess as he slides a cookie sheet under the cake pans to catch the drippings - but my hunch is that the smoke won't affect the flavor of the cake, at least, and he'll forgive you at first bite!

Great recipe. My dad always request this for special occasions. I add extra coconut and chopped cherries on the bottom layer. (I also add about 1/2 cup of coconut in with the cake batter.) This is really a tasty and pretty cake!

In order to make sure the cake doesn't crack, I sliced the top of the cake to make it flat when I laid it down.  I did this for both layers and it didn't crack and looked wonderful.

This is an amazing cake to bake. it is extremely easy and presents very well. i used 
common sense and when the juice didn't make up enough liquid, i added water to 
get the right amount of liquid in the cake mix. Rave reviews from friends and family.
look like you spent hours in the kitchen with little effort. i had the cake on top of a 
warm counter top, so they came out of the pans easily, but can see how the cake would
break up if it was totally cool.

This was a great recipe! I tried it with both the yellow cake and the butter cake (as suggested by some other reviewers) and myself and my wife both thought the yellow cake turned out much better. It was lighter and the taste of butter (in the butter cake it's in the cake and topping) was a bit overwhelming. The butter cake also was much more dense and had a tendency to crumble like cornbread. I did add coconut and coconut extract and did like a couple other peeps said - adding crushed pineapple between a bit of cake with the remaining cake on top of it. It made for a very moist, pineapple/tropical tasting cake. I also used just one layer in a 9x13 glass dish. AWESOME!! Brought it to the 4th of july party as it's my mom's favorite type of cake and she said it was the best she had ever had :)

It's OK.  Nothing great.  I think its the package yellow cake mix in the recipe that I don't like.  I am used to the pineapple upside-down cake from scratch that makes this cake tastes better. Not going to make it again.

Very moist and easy to make.  The coconut makes it different from the regular pineapple upside down cake.  The first time I made this cake the layer with the pineapple rings had large cracks.  The second time around I turned this layer onto the first layer and then immediately put the pan back on it to hold it in place.  After about 3o minutes I took the pan out and...no cracks or falling apart!

This is a wonderful version of an old classic.  I basically did not change anything but did omit the coconut as I did not have any.  It was delicious.  The only thing I will change the next time is to use a 20 oz can of pineapple slices as my 8 oz can only had 4 slices and I wanted more on the top layer. I also will add some maraschino cherry juice with the pineapple juice to the cake.

After reading a lot of the reviews and seeing how some were having problems with it sticking. I read in my old recipe books that were my husbands great grandmothers books, it says to line your pan with waxed paper and then put all your ingrediants in and bake. Should solve any problem your having with sticking

I altered the recipe for what I had on hand, think this is a hard one to mess up!  I used a 9x13 pan, butter cake mix and no crushed pineapple (so one layer).  I added a teaspoon of almond extract and two teaspoons of coconut extract, no actual coconut.  Made the pineapple/butter/brown sugar/cherry top.  Baked at 350 for 50 minutes.  Used the tip to put the pan back on top of the cake after turning out upside down on the plate, no cracks.  First time I have tried to make a pineapple upside down cake and it was devoured.  Delish!

I'm confused because an 8oz. can of Dole Sliced Pineapple yields only 4 slices - not enough to line the pan. I had to run to store for another can. Other than that this recipe was fine.

My husband loved this cake. Here is how I tweaked this recipe for personal tastes: I toasted the coconut first in the preheated oven and I added little dabs of butter around my pineapple to create a more caramel like topping. I also added two teaspoons of ground cinnamon, a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cake batter for a flavor that more resembled spice cake (a family favorite). I like this recipe and may try a splash of vanilla or coconut rum in the batter the next time I make it. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I changed the pineapple ratio though.  I used a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and a 20 oz can of rings in a 9x13 pan (I LOVE pineapple).  Omitted the butter and just sprinkled the brown sugar before the pineapple layer.  I had MORE than enough pineapple juice from the cans and plenty of pineapple flavor.  I used Duncan Hienz Golden Butter Cake...YUM!  It's a keeper!!!

I have always wanted to make this cake and this recipe was great for beginners.
I did not make it 2 layers, only 1...so I omitted the crushed pineapple. I baked it in a round deep dish pizza pan sprayed with PAM, i did not use any butter which turned out to be great.  I let the cake pan cool and tried to flip it our but it did not come out, so i just put in the warm oven a bit to let the brown sugar melt a bit more before i flipped it out....it came out fine and the cake was a great hit. I think im going to try the apple upside down cake for thanksgiving. 
I highly recommend this cake!!!

I made this recipe for New Years Eve!! Turned out GREAT & DELICIOUS!! just a few changes I made to it.. I used Pineapple Flavor Cake Mix, Coconut flakes I put it w the crush pineapple, the only bad thing of this was tht my top layer bread 2 pineapples got stuck to the baking dish, maybe I took a bit long with the bottom layer to take it out..but overall the taste was GREAT!! every one loved the BREAD!!! 

I WILL BAKE THIS BREAD AGAIN IN THE FUTURE!!!

Great recipe.  Very easy to make.  At the suggestion of another review, I used Golden Butter Cake mix rather than plain yellow. I also left out the coconut (not a huge fan). Recipe came out perfectly.  I did think the cooking time was a little long; I took mine out at about 35 minutes.  Wife loves it... will definitely make again.

Very good and easy.  Stays moist for several days.  I bought one large can of pineapple and used half the rings for one layer and crushed the other half that was left for layer #2.

Made this with a couple slight changes.  I used a bundt pan, greased with butter. Poured mix of melted butter and coconut oil in the bottom (about 1 Tbsp of oil and 4 butter).  Then I used 1 1/2 the called for amount of dark brown sugar, sprinkled it on the melted mixture.  Then the coconut followed with the pineapple slices and cherries.  Next I put a layer of the cake mix, a layer of the crushed pineapple then the rest of the cake mix.  As others recommended, I used the butter golden cake mix and used pineapple juice instead of water.  I baked it according to the cake mixes instructions for bundt pan.  It came out WONDERFUL and looked beautiful.  No cracking or worrying about layering.  Try to serve this cake within an hour or so after taking it out of the over.  The crunchy topping is the best and it just isn't as good the next day.

For my first pineapple upside down cake I think it turned out pretty good. First I must say that a 8oz can of sliced pineapple isn't enough. I used a 9x13 pan and only baked it for about 30 minutes.

caked tasted great but needs more pineapple. I agree with others that 4 rings in an 8 oz can isn't enough. Lacked enough pineapple flavor.

This was AWESOME!  My boyfriend could not stop eating it.  I actually thought he was going to make himself sick.  I didn't have two round pie pans, so I used a 13 1/2 x 9 in pan w/o the coconut, and it was just lovely.

Easy and Delicious - Family LOVED it! Did not use the coconut.  I have made the layer cake and the 9x13" versions - both turn out great.  (For the 9x13" version, I omit the crushed pineapple).  Thanks for a great recipe!

I brought this cake into work and it got excellent reviews. I chopped up all the remaining cherries and added them to the pan with the crushed pineapple. The only thing I will do differently next time is double the amount of crushed pineapple that goes between the layers. More is always better.

My husband and I had a craving for cake tonight so I went looking for an easy recipe using items I had in my pantry.  I used white cake mix in place of yellow.  I didn't use coconut or cherries as I didn't have them on hand; and I substited the can of pineapple rings for 1 can of mandarin oranges, along with the 1 can of crushed pineapple.  Baked in a well buttered 9x13 inch pan for 45 minutes.  Very easy and very good!

I really loved how simple this recipe was, however I found that there was not enough pineapple for either layer, so next time I will double sliced and crushed pineapple.  Also omitted the coconut and it didn't take away from the cake at all.  Thanks!

Wow!  I wasn't paying attention when I made this and accidentally doubled the butter.  The cake was amazing!  The butter at the bottom of each pan caramelized the pineapples.  It was truly amazing.  Definitely a keeper!

A delicious cake, it tastes better and better as the days go on! In fact, mold had to grow on it before my husband would let me throw the last bit of it out - the cake was so juicy and good at that point - he still regrets no eating that last piece!

My daughter just graduated from Army basic training & from the beginning of her 10 wks in basic, she wanted me to bring her a pineapple upside down cake. Out of all of the recipes for it, I'm so glad I chose this one. It was moist and delicious & above all else, my new Soldier loved it!! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious and so simple to make! I also went with the 9X13 glass pan, put brown sugar, pineapple slices, cherries and brown sugar, topped with cake batter, layered with crushed pineapple, and topped with more cake batter. I piped whipped cream around the serving platter and garnished with just a bit of powdered sugar. It met with rave reviews by all of my co-workers. Be a little generous with the melted butter in the cake pan, it really keeps it from sticking.

I'm sure it'll taste good but it cracked. :( I guess its not my day. i think next time i'll flip the bottom layer on the platter and the top layer on a silicon mat. wait till cool and then try to layer. it might be easier.

We loved it!  I now see that I made a mistake that was fortunate.  I used 20 oz cans of pineapple.  Had plenty of juice to use in the cake mix.  Also added a little coconut to bottom layer.  Used pans that have turning lever to release cake. Next time I'll add the cherries after it's baked so they show better. --Has anyone tried putting rum in?  Please advise.  Don't want to make it sweeter though...

Delicious! Used 9x13 pans (so used a bit more brown sugar to coat bottoms) and left out the coconut.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and got rave reviews.  So moist!  Will definitely make again.

First, take into consideration that I am using a gas oven. This cake was not moist eventhough I left in in the oven for only 40 minutes and I used a deluxe moist yellow mix. The only things I would change bake for less time, use more crushed pineapple, and add more coconut so that the cake is not so dry. I wish I would have checked it at 30-35 minutes--that would have made a huge difference between perfection and mediocre.

This is a very good cake.  I followed the recipe except for using a goldem butter cake mix and I took the cake out of the pans after about 5 minutes.  Next time I will double the amount of pineapple.  8 oz barely covers the bottom of the pan and 8 oz is only 4 pineapple rings.

This is a very easy and very good recipe.  I did leave the coconut out because this was a birthday cake for a friend who is allergic to coconut but loves pineapple.  I had no problems with the top layer cracking.  I did shave the cake on the top layer to be level with the top of the cake pan before turning it over so it layed perfectly flat.  The double layering adds lots more pineapple to the cake and was a big hit with everyone.  Definitely a keeper.

Two Very Important things To Remember .. 1- DO NOT FORGET Which Pan Has The TOP Layer In It. 2- Place Pineapple down before coconut layer. As you see in the photo, the pineapple tends to disappear. AWESOME Recipe However! -Hornblower

I made this for my Mom's birthday and it was a HUGE hit. I did change up a few things. I bought the pineapple cake mix and added a teaspoon of butter extract and the flavors were phenomenal. I rubbed down my 2 x 9" pans with cold unsalted butter to get a nice coating of butter. On the top tier of the cake I used pineapple rings, maraschino cherries and flake coconut. On the bottom tier, crushed pineapple (which I squeezed excess juice from as to not add to much additional liquid.) I used 1 1/3 cup reserved pineapple juice rather than water in the cake mix itself. I un molded both tiers immediately upon removing from the oven and had no sticking. My top tier did split a little but I came up with a cool fix. While the cake cooled a bit, I toasted some coconut on a baking sheet on 400 for 8 minutes; I melted a 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 Tbs. unsalted butter in a small skillet and brushed that glaze over the cake and it's crack, than sprinkled toasted coconut over that. Once the cake was 2/3 cooled, I was able to gently press the sides together and they held perfectly. This cake definitely makes the rotation from hear on out!!

My brother said this about this recipe:
"I think that this cake is the best pineapple upside down cake that I have ever eaten, and I know pineapple upside down cake." Other members of the family thought this recipe was great also. Thank you, our dessert contribution was a hit.

Love it!  I make this as a 9x13 and still use both the pineapple rings and crushed pineapple.  I place the rings in a pattern on the bottom of the pan and spread creushed pineapple throughout the rest of the pan.  I love the cherries, so I use them generously as well.  This is a major crowd pleaser.  I love the cocount!

Turned out very nice in 2 nine inch cake pans. Came out easily after cutting the edge to even it up. A butter cake make a moister cake, but didn't rise as much as the yellow cake mix. Used both as gifts for Al Geiser and Levi & Edna Miller.

This was quite good (though I think making the cake from scratch is a little better).  I especially loved the addition of the coconut (I may even add a little more next time) and I really dislike coconut. 
I hate to be one of those cooks that gives everyone their advice, but I added a few things that my family really liked, so here they are:

First, I melted 1/4 cup butter in EACH pan in the oven, then added 1/3 cup brown sugar to each and mixed before adding the pineapple, etc.

Second, I whipped one pint of cream and added a small amount of crushed pineapple; I used this as a "filling" between the layers.  It was great when sandwiched between two hot, oozing layers and supported the top layer so cracking was not an issue (I even transported it to my inlaws without any issues).  I really thought these two additions put it over the top, of course, they didn't make it any healthier! :P

Great easy recipe! I made one for my neighbors and he inhaled his peice. I used almost a whole cup of pineapple juice and only wish that the pineapple tasted a little stronger.  Other than that it was great.

I made this cake for a Hawaiian theme party. It was a hit. I took the advice from others and made it using the butter cake mix and I also made sure I sprayed the pans with Pam and used butter.

This cake is awesome. Made without coconut as hubby doesn't like it and it turned out perfect. Looked great and tasted even better. The one thing I added extra was an individul size (about 1/2 cup)of pineapple flavored applesauce and this cake was definately not dry it was very moist and loved by all some said it was the best they ever had. (Did use Duncan Hines moist cake mix)

Fabulous recipe!  My first upside down cake.  No problems at all.  Used 8" round pans instead of 9".  Used one ring of pineapple for the center and cut the other rings in half and arranged them around the center one.  Wonderful!!

This was a very easy cake to make, but did not wow me like I expected.  The presentation was colorful, but the pineapple and cherry didn't stand out enough, and overall the cake was a bit dry.  Also, the recipe calls for 1/4 cup butter, but I could not for the life of me figure out where this was supposed to go.

Yum! You can make it in a 9x13 pan also and it comes out great- just use more of the coconut/ pineapple ring combo for the bottom. Ive made it several times- its always good

A pineapple cake that is to die for!!! This is a soooo easy recipe to make and the results are fabulous! Just remember which pan has the pineapple rings in it. Another way to prevent round cakes (Or any others, for that matter) from rising alot in the middle, take damp tea towels and wrap around the pans. The cake will come out very level. But use a oven mitt to remove them steamy tea towels! ;o)

This recipe is awesome!  I have never ever made a PUD cake before, and it turned out perfectly.  Don't be afraid of making it double-stacked, either.  It really isn't too difficult, and it looks absolutely stunning!  A few tips:  Make sure that the pans are well buttered, to only use a butter recipe yellow cake mix, and to only use 9 inch round cake pans (otherwise the pineapple slices don't fit right).  I also added a bit of cream to get rid of the cake mix taste.  Since I was making this for a Christmas party, I omitted the coconut (too summery), and instead added chopped pecans in the spaces between the pineapple slices.  Lastly, If you don't have enough juice leftover, just top off what you have with plain, old, unsweetened pineapple juice.  Oh yeah.  One last thing ... I also added rum flavored extract to the cake mix.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it as both a double layer and as a single layer 9x13.  The double layer definitely makes an impressive presentation; however, I did not line up the top layer correctly as I was flipping it out of the pan, and I simply could not lift it to straighten it.  Still tasted wonderful!  I will probably do this as a single layer 9x13 from now simply because it's easier and it makes a stunning presentation too!

Awesome recipe. Always made this in 9 x 13 pan. Only thing different was the cherries. When I got the cherries out of the fridge I found my husband had eaten all the cherries. So I spooned cherry juice into the middle of the pineapple ring The juice managed to spread a little which gave it a mixed glow. Only cooked for 32 min. No problem stacking the layers. Only let it cool for 10 min. Came out beautiful for someone that never gets it perfect.

My cake was really moist and delicious. I made a couple of changes recommended by other reviewers. I  replaced the yellow cake mix with Pillsbury's Moist Supreme Golden Butter Recipe mix. I accidentally made the cake with water instead of the reserved pineapple juice, but it was still very flavorful. Lastly, I added 1/2 tsp imitation coconut flavoring to the cake mix. I was very happy with the results and will make this cake again!

Oh My Goodness Wonderful!!! I used a Duncan Hines butter recipe box cake mix when I made your recipe. This Pineapple Upside Down Cake recipe was absolutely AMAZING!!! So light and moist, not overly sweet as pineapple upside down cakes tend to be (in my opinion. This cake just melts in your mouth. I LOVE the idea of baking 2 cakes to layer them. Having the topping of the 2nd layer between the 2 cakes just adds that element of surprise to the overall cake. Thank you so much for this lovely recipe that has now become my favorite and one I will definitely make again and again! I made the recipe exactly as you posted it & it is perfect!!!

This recipe is extremely simple and quick. I followed the recipe, except I bought a 20oz can of pineapple instead of 8oz. It had plenty of juice for the cake mix, and more pineapples to spread around on top. I used non-stick 9" round baking pans. I used butter cake instead of yellow cake mix. I baked for about 35 minutes total, but probably could have baked a little longer (3-5 mins). I let the cakes cool for about 10 minutes, and then inverted. I put the cake pan back on top of the top layer to prevent cracking. Super moist and delicious. Better than any pineapple upside-down cake I have purchased.

This was my first attempt at making homemade this type of cake. Now, note that I am NOT a cake fan myself, and almost never eat it. This cake could change that! The house smelled heavenly! My husband had requested it to take to work for his boss for Boss' Day. It was a real hit, and I hated to see it leave the house! We'll be making another one for us soon. I don't think it has to have the coconut, but either way, fabulous recipe! (I also used a pineapple cake mix, so lots of flavor and a very pretty cake!) Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I made this cake last night for my brothers birthday. I also used the pineapple juice instead of water and instead of putting the coconuts inside I toasted it and stuck it to the sides which I smeared and filled with pineapple custard. Let's just say they plate was returned to me sparkiling clean within an hour.

I gave this 4 stars ONLY because when I cooked it with the coconut it wasn't that good.  Without it the cake was spectacular!  I also tried making it as mini cakes by using a large muffin pan.  I placed the butter and sugar in the bottom of each muffin hole and then placed a whole slice of pineapple with a cherry in the center in the bottom.  Afterwards I poured the batter on top and cooked for about 23 min.  Definitely use a BUTTER yellow cake mix.  There is a difference.  If you make these you will not be disappointed!  This technique yielded about 9 mini cakes for me.

I make my own cake mix and it is perfect.  Use 2 cups flour, 1 1/2 cup sugar, 4 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 3 eggs, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, and 1 cup of the reserved pineapple juice from the crushed and sliced pineapple.  My cake never cracks and my daughter's boyfriend family always raves about it.

Very interesting spin to pineapple upsided down cake. The addition of the coconut was clever ad tasted great! Why didn't I think of that? I only gave it  4 stars because like other reviewers, I found that the top cake really wanted to fall off.It was a like stand-off between me and the top cake If you find a way to solve this problem then it will be 5 stars for sure

First time making this recipe and it turned out great! I used 8in. round cake pans , put 1 tbs of butter in each pan and put it in the oven to melt while the oven is preheating ,golden butter cake mix , 1/2 cup of coconut for both pans , also I used less of the brown sugar. I set my timer for 25 mins. but needed to add 15 mins. more.As soon as they came out of the oven I stacked them. ** TIP** The top of my cake started to crack , so I wrapped foil around the cake to push it in. Let it cool , remove and no cracks!!

This cake was great. I'm not usually a cake person, but this one came out so moist and delicious. The coconut really added something special. I did use golden butter cake instead of the yellow cake. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Was anyone else confused by the instructions to butter the pans with all that butter, or are you supposed to melt the butter in the pan?  I didn't know what to do with all that butter and I noticed some of you melted it. Was anyone else curious about that?

very good. I did not use the crushed pineapples, instead made a 9X13 and used a large can of pineapple slices. Baked 40 minutes. The coconut was an excellent addition, who would have ever thought of that. Will make again.

This recipe was very good. I did not make a layer cake, just made a 9 X 13 single layer cake.  I like to keep things pretty simple.  The cake was delicious with the pineapple juice.  And, we really liked the coconut/brown sugar/pineapple ring combination.  It carmalized nicely, and was very yummy.  I did not use the crushed pineapple since I didn't make the layers, but I may try that when I make the cake for company.  My husband took some to work and shared with his co-workers.  He said it was a hit there as well.

This is a really good cake.  I'm not a huge fan of pineapple upside down cake but my wife is.  She requests this cake often and it disappears quickly.  I add an extra handful of coconut because thats just how I like it, but otherwise a great recipe.

I've made this cake two times now in the past two months.  The first time, strictly according to the recipe and it turned out excellent!  I love the presentation of the double layer!  The second time I made it I couldn't find my coconut.  I also eye-balled the brown sugar and probably used a little more than it called for.  Both times I just rubbed softened butter on the cake pans and I'm sure I used much less than the 1/4 cup it called for.

My pineapple cans hold 20 oz and this recipe calls for 8 oz, so I used about half the can of crushed pineapple and saved the left-over pineapple to use in the "Best Carrot Cake Recipe Ever" that I got off this site as well.  All in all, a very satisfying cake which my family loved!

I don't know what I did wrong, but I really screwed this cake up.  First of all, I baked it in a 9x13 pan.  I didn't use a full 1/4 cup butter to grease the pan, but there was a hefty layer of butter with some chunks in it as well.  I doubled or added a little extra of the brown sugar.  I doubled or added a little extra of the coconut, as well.  I placed the pineapple rings and cherries as directed.  I used a Duncan Hines pineapple cake mix, put pineapple juice in instead of the water called for, and put one cup of crushed pineapple in the cake batter.  I baked this for 45, maybe 50 minutes, and let cool for 20 minutes before inverting.  I was so disappointed to find that only the sides were baked.  The bottom didn't come out of the pan at all, either.  I inverted THAT mess back into the pan and put it back in the oven.  My oven was set for 350 degrees, and I have never had a problem with it not baking other items as directed.  What a disappointment, especially considering this was meant to be for a Hawaiian party.  :(  I don't want to try to make it again before the party (to produce a pretty version) in case it won't turn out the second time either.    This is probably the first recipe I have made that has completely flopped, and I don't know what went wrong other than the crushed pineapple doing it?  (but the sides were baked).  I guess this needed 70 minutes to bake in my oven.  I tested the cake with a toothpick and it looked clean, but it was raw in there.  :(

Easy recipe to please everyone. I've noticed that even those who don't get much of a thrill over sweets will love a slice of pineapple upside-down cake. 

What's great about this recipe is it looks like you went through a lot of trouble to make it but it actually couldn't be easier.

I just took the cake out of the oven.  I haven't tried it yet but wanted to make a few suggstions.Really grease the pan.  I had trouble removing the cakes so they did crack.  Start checking for doneness at 30 minutes.  The receipe calls fourty minutes- it will be too dry. I can't wait to taste it tonight.  If it tastes good I'll try to make it again so it looks pretty!

I made this for my dad's birthday and he said it tasted just liked the one his Grandma used to make for him when he was a kid.  Excellent.  I drained the pineapple extra time, so I wouldn't have the falling apart problem and also put the cake pan over it as stated in previous review and it worked beautifully.  Pretty cake.

This cake is moist and delicious. However, I have found that flipping the top layer, while warm, will cause the cake to crack. Instead, flip the top layer on to a screen and allow it cool for about 5 minutes before sliding it off of the cooling rack and onto the bottom cake layer. Don't let them cool completely or the layers wont stay as securely. This yummy cake deserves the extra effort! *^_^*

Wonderful recipe! Makes a delicious, moist cake! Adjustments that I made: (1) Used apple sauce instead of oil (in cake directions) (2) bake according to directions on mix (3) used pineapple juice instead of water.

I have always found upside down cakes boring but my father-in-law loves them.  This was such an AWESOME cake.  I used Duncan Hines pineapple cake mix.  The 8oz can of pineapple rings left me about 3 rings short, bought the 20oz. can the next time.  Thank you for the recipe, it has become a new favorite for my family.

Yum!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Like another person mentioned, I also added vanilla pudding mix to the batter, and I found that a smaller jar of cherries is all that is needed.  I like the ideas some had of using pecans if you're not a huge coconut fan.  What an AWESOME cake this is!!

Brought it to a luau and everyone loved it!!  I found that it was a little difficult to slice because of the pineapple slices. I didn't let it cool as long and it came out of pans perfectly.  Will definitely make again!!

i made this cake and it turned out perfect, so beautiful...but it didn't taste that great., not bad, it just didn't seem to taste as good as it looked.  i used a pineapple cake mix according to the pkg directions instead of the water/pinapple juice in the recipe, and i added 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the coconut layer.  after a couple of days the cake was soggy and unappealing.  i would definitely make again for a large gathering when an impressive looking dessert was called for, maybe adding a little rum or rum extract to kick the flavor up a notch.

YUK! If you like dry, bland cake, then this recipe is for you. By using just the pineapple juice, you are almost a cup short of liquid.  This causes the cake to be exceptionally dry.  By making it a layer cake you've got two dry cake layers stacked on top of each other that just end up looking like two cake rounds needing to be frosted.  Most unattractive to look at and not very good to eat. Stay away from this recipe.

This cake was so delicious, and so moist!  My husband says that it is the best cake that he has ever had, period.  It gets even better as the days pass (If you still have any!) because it gets even moister as the juices have time to sink in.

The cake came out wonderfully! It was very moist! My husband is not a cook at all, he barely knows were anything goes in the kitchen and he would be able to make this cake! The top didn't harden like otter reviewers did. I omitted the coconut because I don't care much for coconut and I used a bundt pan instead of making it a layer cake. Other than that I  followed directions verbatim. I would like to find a homemade version of this recipe and try that! Half of the cake was gone the first night I made it and only 5 people got some and one doesn't even care for pineapple, so, needless to say I will be making this again, and again and again!

Pineapple!!!Who would have ever thought this fruit could be come a head turner!!! I LOVE LOVE this pineapple upside down cake! To make it yummier I used 1 (8oz) cream cheese, using with about 1/4 cup of some of the left over flaked coconut and 1 tsp of vanilla extract, using a hand mixer to incorporate it together for 2 minutes. I reserved enough of it to use on the sides of the cake and stuck more coconut on the sides and I used the rest between the top and bottom layer which was very tasty and kept them to stick together. Look for the pictures I submitted so you can see what I actually mean. I didn't want any of the taste of the cherry since cherry isn't the best tasting fruit especially after being in the preservatives in the liquid it comes in, I just used it as a garnish, putting one in the ring of each pineapple after it was baked. I also sprayed butter flavored spray oil ONLY in the bottom cake pan then used wax paper (or you can use parchment paper)on top of that and sprayed the top of the wax paper with a little more of the spray so that the bottom cake would not stick or be dry. It is the moistest yummiest cake ever!! This cake is absolutely fail proof and people will think you got it from a bakery; it's that good!!!

Huge success. I used pineapple cake mix. Everything else was the same. Everyone was happy. I also followed cooking time on the cake mix box. The suggested time is to long.

This was incredible and so easy.  Next time I will use more crushed pineapple for the bottom layer.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect as is.

Amazing cake. This is the first time I make a pineapple upsidedown cake & it turned out great. The only change I made was to make it as one cake in a 9x13 glass dish and also used two 14oz cans of pineapple slices which was enough to cover bottom and sides of dish. It looks very pretty too. Would be great for company.

I made this recipe as directed, and the cake came out PERFECT! Very tasty, smells fantastic. I do agree that this recipe could use a little more pineapple than directed, but my results came out so great, I'll probably do it just the same in the future.

Cake typically boxed. Light and lacks substance. Brown sugar and butter topping skimpy and dry. Would increase butter and cut back amount of coconut.

This recipe is simple and delicious!  Using two layers and adding coconut made all the difference.  I imagine that eating this with just pineapple would be boring after having had it this way.  Everyone in the apartment loved it.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I took some of the left over pineapple circles and cut them in half and lined them up along the side sof the pans. Once the batter was poured in, they stayed in place. They stuck up above the batter, but once the cakes were baked, they were covered. The pineapple halves made for a beautiful design on the sides of the cake when they were stacked on top of each other.
   I also agree, the Pillsbury was the best mix, it was very moist and really tasted great!

Made this cake with the Butter Golden cake mix, no coconut, and extra pineapple slices on top...pretty and delicious! Using a 9-inch round pan, needed to cook for about 26 minutes (not the 40-50 recommended)...Great recipe!

The sweet dessert is beautiful. I shorten the baking time by ~10 minutes. Instead of crushed pinapple I used one can of rings at 20 oz. For the second layer I cut up the remaining rings. Next time I will add more brown sugar. And I omitted the coconut and added pecans on top with the fruit. Oh, this recipe made a little more than my 9 inch pans would hold. Happy Birthday Buzz!

Turned out really good. I wish that I had added the rest of the crushed pineapple to the cake mix, it would have made it a 5 star recipe. I added a little bit of butter extract since the cake mix I had was just a regular yellow cake mix.

This is an excellent recipe! My dad requested a Pineapple Upside Down Cake for his 67th birthday today and this is the one that I chose to make. He was blown away! He said it was the best Upside Down Cake he had ever had (and believe me, at 67, he doesn't compliment much anymore unless it is earned :)~  We loved the addition of the coconut. I was surprised at how pretty it looked as a double layer cake. I did have a very slight sticking problem with the bottom layer's pineapple but it was really easy to just place a couple of small areas back on and it will never be noticed. I only waited about 10 min before turning the cakes out of the pans. I am really looking forward to the next request for this cake. It is delicious. Thanks for sharing!

So yummy! The coconut really makes it over-the-top-delicious!!! My only problem was that the when I put the second layer on top of the first layer, the edges cake kind of bowed out, creating cracks in the cake between the pineapple rings. To avoid this next time, we are going to flip the second layer on top of the first, but LEAVE THE PAN ON until it cools...I think that should do the trick.

I love this cake! I've made it four or five times already. I am generous with the buttering of the pans to prevent sticking. I also use extra crushed pineapple and chopped cherries on the second layer. I use either Pillsbury or Duncan Hines Butter cake mix and use the pineapple juice from the cans of pineapple instead of water in the mix. You only need to wait maybe 10 minutes after baking to flip the cakes out. It does help to put a pan on top of the cake like a hat to prevent cracking while the cake cools. Not only does this cake look amazing, but it tastes amazing too!

I used a butter cake mix instead of yellow cake mix but followed everything else according to directions.  It was good but there was not enough pineapple for my liking.  Next time I will use the larger can of crushed pineapple to put on the bottom later and a little more brown sugar/butter mixture to coat the pans with.

This was so easy & delicious.  I made it for my book group & they loved it & had seconds.  I made it in a 9x13 pan, used a 15oz can of pineapple slices instead of 8oz. (there were a few rings left over but the 8oz wouldn't have had enough rings or juice) the 8oz of crushed pineapple that the recipe called for & 4 Tbs of butter instead of 2 Tbs.  I let it set 10 minutes then flipped it upside down & it came out perfect.  It baked for about 40 minutes.  It was very moist & yummy!

Sensational Cake!! I used twice as much coconut as called for *awesome* I put the whole cake in one 9 x 13" pan. I also used Pilsbury yellow cake mix, definitely the best! I used one large can of pineapple chunks for the cake. I added 1/2 cup of pecans to the coconut, brown sugar, butter mixture in the bottom of the pan. Everyone thought this was the best cake ever! So moist and so flavorful, the coconut is a delight in this cake, it adds a crunchy sweet surprise when cooked w/ that brown sugar & butter! When it was done I flipped the whole cake over on a cookie sheet lined w/ parchment. *add the melted butter, brown sugar, coconut, pecans, then the pineapple, then the mixed cake batter.* It took about an hr. to bake at 350 for the 9 x 13" pan. It's delicious :-)

This tasted great. The presentation lacked. I made one 2 layer cake, and one flat cake. The flat one stuck to the pan, and came out funky looking. They all tasted good though. Add nonstick or more butter to the bottom next time.

Very easy to make!!!  I've always made from scratch, and this was the first time I've made it from a box mix, and it was quick and easy.  And very yummy too.

This was the first pineapple Upside down cake I ever made and it turned out awesome.  I did read the reviews and used the golden butter cake as well as only half of the coconut.  I also started to check it after 25 minutes in the oven and it was done in about 30.  It could not have tasted better.  I was disappointed to see that some people thought this recipe was a disaster and I am glad I tried it.  We will make it again for sure!  By the way, it tastes best when it is still warm out of the oven :)

I have made this cake twice...first time was very beautiful.  The second I took it out of the pan to early and it spread open around the pineapples...be sure to cool it but not to long!  I haven't actually tasted the cake, but I have been told they are great!!

I have made this recipe twice and it is a BIG hit! I omit the coconut as I'm not a fan. I took the advice and used Pillsbury Supreme Moist Yellow Cake mix. The cake is always so moist!

When our 7-year old saw the ingredients on the kitchen counter, he quickly said "I am not going to eat that, I don't like pineapple". However, when he smelled the cake fresh from the oven, he wanted to try it while it was warm, he just couldn't resist the smell... and he's eating the cake away. It's moist and delicious even after a couple of days in the fridge. We will definitely make it again. I made one minor change: since the pineapple juice from the cans wouldn't fill one cup, I completed it with the liquid from the maraschino cherries. Next time I will try soaking the pineapple rings in rum, yummy.

To prevent the cake from sticking to the pan and falling apart when you flip it over... spray the pans with lots of Pam in addition to the butter.  I would also use more crushed pinapple next time.  Awesome cake!!

Turned out perfect.  I made this for Easter.  Based on other reviewers suggestions I made the following changes.  I used Pillsbury Golden Yellow Cake mix, substituting reserved pineapple juice for the water.  I Started with a fairly thick layer of butter on each cake pan.  I used fresh pineapple for the rings, and a full 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple for the bottom part ( well drained).  I reduced the coconut to a sprinkling. I increased the amount of brown sugar, just sprinkled on top of the butter until it looked right.  After inverting the top cake I put the pan back on until the cake cooled.  Also it took longer for the top to cook than the bottom.  The bottom was done in 30 min and the top took about 40 min.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will be making again.

I really liked this recipe. Instead of two pans I used one big pan and added alittle more pineapple and coconut. My boyfriend loved it so much that it was gone in 3 days. He said it was just like his grandmothers. Thanks for the recipe..

This is a pretty good recipe.  I decided not to make it a layer cake, so I put it in a small sheet cake pan.  I used 2 Jiffy yellow cake mixes.  Turned out pretty good, except that I think I cooked it a little too long so it browned a little too much, so be careful about that.  I cooked it about 35 minutes or so, but I might try about 30 next time.  I ended using more pineapple then it calls for also.  I might try substituting a little applesauce for something next time, or using a different cake mix.  My kids love it!

This cake is fantastic! I used two 8-inch cake pans and it turned out great, too. I sprinkled some crushed pecans on top of the first layer and the second layer and it was really good. When I baked the yellow cake, I baked 5 minutes less than what it was written on the box and it turned out to be more moist! Also, instead of using two 8 oz pineapple cans, I just got a can of 20oz pineapple slices. I put 5 rings on one pan, and I crushed the rest of the rings and put that on the other pan. Worked great. I suggest this recipe to those who are the fan of pineapple upside down cake!

Very, very good! Made it for my wife's birthday party. Very easy to make. Only thing I was clueless about-- I'm not a very experienced baker, since you can't bake cakes on a grill (I'm a guy)-- was what to do with the 1/4 c. butter. I know you were supposed to butter the pan, but I think some other recipes involve melting butter and mixing with the brown sugar on the bottom. The final appearance of the cake wasn't as nice as some PUD cakes I've seen, but MAN, the taste was great! Even lasted without drying out for days. Just finished it for lunch. Mmmm... fattening.

I used a mix with pudding already added, and I used crushed pineapple on both layers and did use the coconut and cherries.  I also added enough water to make a cup of liquid.  The cake turned out beautifully, and was delicious!  The first time I made it I took it to a church potluck, and I received compliments.

this is a great recipe, I have never had a pineapple cake turn out! I did make some changes: 

I put this cake in a 9X13 instead of 2 pans. I was worried about it not coming out right because that is my luck! lol I also didn't have crushed pineapple I just used the slices and made a one layer instead of two.

Loved the coconut and flavor with this cake. It came out perfect!

The ingredients are great, but the baking time listed is WAY too long. It says 40-50 minutes for two small round pans. I did 45 minutes and my cakes were extremely overcooked, dried out, and the pineapple all stuck. Would be willing to try it again for 30 minutes, but I'm super bummed right now (it was my mom's birthday cake).

My granddaughter wanted dark chocolate pineapple upside down cake! We used dark chocolate cake mix. Adding the pineapple juice to dark chocolate mix made it awesome! Think she started a new tradition! Try it.

Delicious!   I was excited and nervous to make an upside cake, but this recipe made it easy!    I added parchment paper cut to fit the pan.  The only thing I didn't like was the coconut on top.   It covered the pineapple rings so that you couldn't see them.  You actually couldn't tell it was a pineapple upside down cake, so I will definitely leave that off in the future.

Very easy to make and it was delicious! I only had pineapple chunks, but they were no problem and I added more cherries than if you just put them inside the pineapple rings.

I've been using this recipe for a long time!  Can substitute with just about any boxed cake mix on hand, but I like it best with a butter recipe yellow (Duncan Hines, I think).  Thanks for a solid go-to, easy dessert!

Don't like yellow cake mix so I use a pineapple cake mix (if I'm in a hurry and can't make from scratch).  Really good!  As another reviewer says, turn pan over right away after baking so that the topping drips onto the cake and doesn't stick in the bottom of the pan.

I tried this recipe today because I happen to have a fresh and ripe golden pineapple. I sliced some of it into rings for the one layer with a whole slice going into the middle and half slices around the outside. I found that it took longer to bake but not sure if it's a wet cake or the golden cake that I made from scratch. The 2-cakes took 20-minutes longer than suggested in the recipe. When I flipped out the top layer there wasn't very much of the melted brown sugar. I melted a cup of brown sugar, 2 tbls of lime juice and a bit of water. I drizzled the syrupy mixtures to cover the top and down the sides. This acted like a glaze and the cake looks great  - more finished.

I really enjoyed this cake.  I used crushed pineapples instead of rings to get a sweeter flavor all over.  I will be making this again soon.

edit 2015: i am asked to make this cake over and over again.

everyone loves it. First time I did as directed, but the 2 layers seemed odd with nothing inbetween. The second time I added some coconut to the mix (3/4 cup) and made it in one big 9x13 pan. Muy delicious. Even made it for thanksgiving dinner!

I loved this cake but I made a few changes. I totally omitted the coconut.   I used a 9x13 glass  pan instead of 2 cake pans.  I used Duncan Hines moist butter mix or even Pillsbury moist butter mix.  I used the pineapple juice as well I added a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice.  The first layer was with the pineapple rings then half the batter.  Then I added the crushed pineapple with cherries and the remaining batter.  It was so moist and delicious.  Everyone raved about it!!

I made this for my husband and he said it's probably the best pineapple upside-down cake he's ever had. I didn't change a thing. I baked it in two 9in round layering pans and they were finished baking in 35 minutes. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

My husband just called this 'the best pineapple upside-down cake I've ever had in my life' so I'd say it was a winner!  The only change was that I substituted 1/4 C rum for the same amount of pineapple juice in the cake mix, which added a subtle and tasty flavor.  Overall it was pretty easy and delicious!  We'll definitely have this again.

I didn't have the time to deal with two pans, so made this in a 9x13 pan and didn't use the crushed pineapple or the coconut (wasn't sure about it as we were taking this to a party).  the juice in place of the water was SO good.  Couple people had multiple pieces, this was just moist (used moist cake mix) and had great flavor.  I didn't use a full 1/2 c of brown sugar but next time I will.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but made it for my daughters birthday. It was delicious!!! The only change I made was when making the actual cake batter. I used the "Butter Recipe" yellow cake mix. I substituted pineapple juice for the water. It added more flavor & melody. I hope your family enjoys it as much as ours did:)

I made this for my daughter-in-laws birthday, she loved it.  I found it a little to sweet, next time I will cut down on brown sugar.  Instead of crushed pineapple I used pineapple chunks; instead on coconut I used slivered almonds. (the only reason I did this was because that is what I had on hand.

This cake is great. I never would have thought to layer an upside down cake, but it works well and looks very pretty. My only addition was to add chopped pecans to the layer with the brown sugar and crushed pineapple (the bottom layer). The top layer cracked a bit like some others have posted. Next time I'll try to be more gentle with the top.  I put the pan back on after layering like someone else suggested, and that worked well. Thanks for this idea!

This is a keeper. I'm going to try without the coconut next time, since we aren't coconut fans. It does give good flavor but I don't like the texture of coconut. It was still good though. Thanks for the recipe!!

A yummy cake, but not the punch of a pineapple upside down cake that I'm used to.  I'd say increase the butter, brown sugar and pineapple to create more of an upside down cake sensation!

This cake came out great! I will say that the 8 ounce can of sliced pineapple wasn't enough. If I make this again I will use more to cover the top.

This cake is so good! I keep getting requests from people to make it again. Excellent! I also drizzle some frosting on the sides made of pinapple juice, butter and confectioner's sugar.

Turned out great, but beware of over-baking.  I turned each layer out onto my cake plate straight out of the oven and had no trouble with cracking.  Presentation was lovely!  Was really good with a big dollop of fresh whipped cream and a maraschino cherry on top of each serving!

Yum. This is one of the best pineapple upside-down cakes I've had in a long time. I didn't have coconut or maraschino cherries. It would've been prettier if I had that on hand but I didn't miss it. I especially love the double layer aspect of this cake. Thanks Donna for an excellent recipe.

My son asked for a pineapple cake for his birthday... This recipe was great!!! i added 2 tbsp of white vanilla extract and 2 tbsp of Myers's Rum to give it a little kick. Very sweet and moist. Next time i would use the crushed pineapple for the top also to make it easier to cut. Love this recipe thank you :-)

Used the butter cake mix. Delicious. Cooked in a bundt pan.  I was afraid of overcooking it so I accidentally undercooked it, but still really tasty! Made it for dad and he loved it too.

It was a great cake! My friends and I loved it! It was tricky remembering whitch pan had the cheeries and witch pan didn't, but I put sticky notes beside the pans so I could remember. I wasn't a big fa of how crunchy the brown sugar was on the top, and it was really sweet! I am not sure if the sweetness is in a good way... Over all I am really impressed about how easy this was to prepare. That usally never happens!

wonderful taste!! entire cake was gone at the last pot-luck!! I used the Pilsbury moist and delicious yellow as one of the comments suggested. The apperance wasnt as i had hoped, as the sides were plain (picture two unfrosted cakes on top of one another).

I LOVE this recipe!  I use all recipes as guidelines, here's how I changed this one up.  I make one larger round cake, I have a great round cake pan that fits all of the batter into it.  I add the crushed pineapple to the batter when making the cake mix.  When I have everything added and mixed, minus the water/pineapple juice, I add enough pineapple juice to make it the right consistency.  I then bake it for 50/60 minutes.  My co-workers request this cake all the time!  The rings/cherries on top make this cake look so professional, and it's so easy!  I also have found pineapple cake mix in the store to make this cake especially pineapple-y!

This cake is amazing. We have made it several times. its huge at christmas. If your having problems with it sticking we always use a silicon baking pan, that thing is soo awesome it never sticks and the cake just pops right out of the pan its perfect for all cakes. yoou can even take it out without letting it cool just flip it and lift it up. great cake. i also use some juice from the cherries or chop up some cherries and pineapple really small and add it to the mix. the flavor is unbelievable. thanks for sharing

Delicious!  I  used Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Butter Recipe Golden cake mix and margarine instead of butter. I only needed to bake the cakes for about 25 minutes, but my oven does tend to run hot. I only let the cakes cool for about five minutes before removing them because I was concerned about sticking and the cakes slid right out. To prevent cracking I wrapped the cake in foil because the cake pan held in too much heat and started to over-brown the cake. I also used a 15oz can of crushed pineapples (not all of it but almost), instead of just an 8oz. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

Awesome Recipie! Husband Loved it! Used, Duncan Hines Butter Golden Yellow cake mix and land o lakes butter. Only had to bake for 30 minutes. Let cool on racks for about 10 minutes (didn't want it to stick to pans) and placed on cake plate, placed pan back on top layer as another reviwer suggested to help reduce cracking for about 20 minutes. I then uncovered and let it sit out for another hour before placing in frig, husband wanted it cold!! Didn't use the coconut, but was still amazing!! Thanks, this one is going in the book!!

Very good! though i put the coconut down before the pineapple and it  end up looking like i wished it would, so i would advise to put down the pineapple first. Also I used Duncan Hines Moist Golden cake, and it tasted a bit well, cake mixey. Next time I will definitely make the cake from scratch.

Great Recipe!  My family loved it!  I used a 9x13 cake pan and also used the Golden Butter cake mix instead of the yellow cake. Lined the pan with butter, brown sugar, pineapple slices & cherries. I mixed the crushed pineapple with the entire cake mix. It turned out great! Thanks for sharing...I'll definitely be making this again!

This is an excellent recipe! I agree with the others that say not to use too much coconut on the bottom of the pan. If you do, you cannot see the pineapple slices. I will definitely make this again, I made it for my friend's mom's birthday cake...her request was pineapple upside down cake. It was a HUGE hit but I should have made 2, it will not last!

i used this recipe to make a single layered cake and it turned out great--the second time.  I would advise to go easy and eyeball it on the brown sugar and coconut flakes or else you can end up with a crispy brown top with no pineapple or cherries in sight. otherwise, great!

This was awesome!! I got the butter cake mix instead of yellow but that was the only thing I did different. I even made an "ooopsie" and for got to drain the juice from the crushed pineapple, and then I had to drain it from the pan!! lol but it still came out amazing, I will be making this again! Oh, and you really should use the coconut, I know it sounds strange but it makes this cake have such a great flavor!!

I made this in a 9X13 pan and needed an entire 20 oz can of sliced pineapple to cover the pan.  I omitted the crushed pineapple and coconut only because I didn't have any.  I baked it for 50 minutes and immediately flipped it and it was perfect!  In the future I will use cubed pineapple in place of the slices because it would just be easier to cut and eat (although the slices do make it pretty).  Also, I thought the cherries were overwhelming but my mom loved them so it's just personal preference.  Overall great cake!!

This cake is terrific!!! I made it for my sister's birthday and it came out absolutely great. My dad who is not a fan of cakes went back for a second piece! The only changes I made was I used the Philsbury super moist yellow butter cake mix. It came  out very moist and delicious. Next time I will cut the coconut down by half, because I dont think all that much is needed. I will surely make this again and again!! thanks!

This is an awesome recipe.  I used a butter cake mix and extra crushed pineapple.  The only problem I had is the top cake split open when I stacked it.  I should have trimmed down both cakes so they would sit evenly.  My family didn't care though.  The cake was actually better the next day.

I am a great cook. I bake all the time and this was an utter disaster! I made the cake the night before for company the next day. Boy am I glad I did, now I can still fix this huge catastrophe! I followed several of the tips, put the cool whip between the layers to stop the cracking, etc. and it was still horrible! Maybe if you don't care how it looks then by all means go ahead and make this cake but don't try to make it the first time for company unless you are a pastry chef. All I can say is good luck! (Also, I let my kids have some of the mistake and my daughter couldn't even eat it, she said it was way too sweet. My son only had a small part of his and told me even he felt sick.) Never again will this recipe be made in this house. 
(By the way, I don't very often come on to give reviews but this was such a disaster I wanted to keep someone else from making such a big mistake!)

I found this receipe very easy to make, however, it was extremely super super sweet.  I almost overdose with all the sugar LOL  Overall, I recommend cutting down on the brown sugar to about 1/2 cup of brown sugar as well as the butter amount.

I added only 1/4 cup of the coconut instead of the full 1/2 cup.  The people who hate coconut still said it would have tasted better without.  My cake also cracked open on the top, even though I left the cake pan on it until it cooled.  It is an okay recipe overall, but I think next time I will just make a one layer pinneapple upside-down cake.

This was sooooo delicious.  It was very moist and certainly didn't take long to vanish in my home.  I used a 8x11 pan, so when baking, I needed to bake it just a little longer, but I used a glass pan and reduced the cooking temperature to 325.  I will add this to one of our family favorites.  Thanks for the recipe!

Where do I start...well the tast is there; it is tasty. The moisture is there; BUT it has barely risen...don't know if that was supposed to happen; inverting it was plain painful! It fell apart. I was preparing to ice this cake (to serve to my daughter as her birthday cake as she absolutely loves pineapple) but thought, why bother...I am on my way to the supermarket to buy additional ingredients to make a different cake. Sorry but I am a little frustrated! I followed this recipe exactly and cannot see where I may have gone wrong. I will not make this again :-( As a matter of fact I have deleted it from my recipe box...Sorry!

I don't really care for pineapple upside-down cake, but a friend asked me to make one for an office party.  This was very easy and it came out great.  I didn't use coconut and I used cooking spray instead of the butter.  I highly recommend the butter.  I almost had a disaster getting the cakes to come out without tearing them up.  Everyone loved the cake and commented on how moist it was.

First time I have ever eaten or made a pineapple upside-down cake. I think I like it! I used a pineapple cake mix and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil to cut back on fat. Instead of using the juice from the canned pineapple I used some coconut water. It comes in a can like soda and is usually found in the ethnic foods aisle. It's the water from inside a coconut, NOT the thick coconut milk used in Thai cooking. The combination of pineapple and coconut is great, reminds me of a pina colada. I also used 1/4 cup dark rum mixed with the 3/4 cup coconut water for a little kick. I think next time I make this cake I will use the pineapple juice, more rum and less coconut water. I would also toast the shredded coconut before using it in the recipe and increase the amount since I love coconut! I'd also increase the brown sugar so there would be more of the syrupy crunchy crust it forms when baking. Overall this is a great recipe because you can increase or decrease the pineapple and coconut flavors to your liking!

Too sweet for my liking. 

I followed recipe to the "T" and the top layer cracked (large cracks) when I placed it on top of the bottom layer, also had a difficult time when cutting it, it broke all apart.

My family was so impressed with the outcome of this dessert. I found it to be delicious. I made two separate 9” cakes (not a two layer cake)… So I did not use the crushed pineapple, and instead used pineapple rings and maraschinos cherries for the surface of both cakes. The tops of the cakes were caramelized and delightful. Next time, I may mix a little bit of flaked coconut into the cake batter (we really like coconut).

Delicious!  The addition of coconut was fantastic!  Everyone loved it.  It is very moist but also VERY crumbly.  The second time I made it, I added a bit more brown sugar & butter for the topping.  I put coconut in each layer and made it as 2 separate cakes instead of a double layer cake.  I found it easier to cut if you use all crushed pineapple instead of the rings. Sprinkle with powdered sugar to make it pretty.

I have made this cake twice so far.  Used 1/4 c. coconut flakes.  Doubled the pineapple rings.  Added more cherries.  Used 1 1/3 c pineapple juice in cake mix.  Turned out pretty nice and moist.

Everyone raved about this at my dinner party. They said it tasted like a Pina Colada cake! The only drawback I thought was that it needed to be gooey-er. Maybe next time I will add mroe brown sugar. other than that....no complaints!

My family named my cake the ugly upside down cake.  It was moist and delicious but boy was it ugly.  It looked like it got hit by a car.  I don't blame the recipe because I hate to bake.  I love to cook but hate to bake.  SouthJersey Joy

I made this for a family gathering and it disappeared.  For the liquid in the cake batter, I used pineapple juice, but I only got a cup of juice out of the cans of pineapple.  So, I used coconut rum to make up for the rest of the liquid.  It went over very well.  Very easy to make too.

Very good and easy to make. I had no trouble getting the cake out of the pan or putting the 2nd layer on top. I will however try the suggestion to leave the cake pan on the top layer until it cools to avoid cracking. Mine did crack a little but it did nothing to the taste. Thanks Donna for you recipe!!

This turned out great!  I did take the advice someone offered of putting the cake pan back on the cake after it was flipped so it did not crack.  It worked well and my cake was very pretty.  I also used almost the entire 20 oz can of the pinenapples and juice.  The cake part wasn't to die for but not bad.

Ok, the taste of this cake was really great. But, the thing is like impossible to make look nice! I tired what others suggested and kept the top pan on the top layer until cooled and it was still completely lopsided and broken on top. Taste was fabulous-Appearance was not so great.

The aroma on this cake was very good along with the taste, but the presentation of it was alittle disappointing.  I wasn't able to see the pineapple rings after it was baked.

This was excellent! I wqas short on time, so I only made this a one layer cake. Couldn't be easier, nor quicker to make. I substituted apple sauce for the oil and it still came out moist.

Excellent recipes..But I did not have enough sliced pineapple to cover the cake. There were only 4 pieces in the can. Anyway, the cake still tasted excellent..Next time I will just get an extra can of sliced pineapples and maybe a little more crushed pineapple, to make the middle a little thicker. :) Thanks!

Great cake! Using the pineapple juice instead of water adds a lot of flavor.  I do suggest letting the top layer cool for longer than recommended because it may crack if still too warm when turned over.

This is easy and no one would ever know it has a box cake mix unless you tell them. I did use a 14 ounce can of both sliced and crushed pineapple instead of the 8 for I'm always afrade of not having enought topping. I'm glad I did for the smaller size would of made for a very thin layer.

I first made this over an year ago and just getting around to rating it. I have made this at least 5 times and it turns out great everytime.

Yum, yum, yum!  I made this for my fiance's family and they all loved it.  I did not have enough pinapple juice left over, so I used a small amount of orange-pinapple juice and it turned out great.

This is the first time I've tasted my own PUD cake, but my second time making it. I think it's a good cake,(eventhough I'm not sure what they're supposed to taste like!) I omitted the cherries, and the 8oz can of pineapple slices only containced 4, so I added an 8oz can of crushed pineapples in the gaps not covered by the slices. Also, I did not drain the pineapples for the bottom layer. I added coconut flavoring, omitted the coconut flakes and added vanilla extract. I have a friend that says she adds almond extract w/vanilla extract, but I thought that would taste funny with the coconut. Good cake. I'm not sure how to keep the two layers together when serving, though.

This cake was so very easy to make, and very good, especially the topping--yum.  The cake did seem slightly dry...maybe yellow pudding cake mix next time or add some butter.  Everyone loved it, I'll make this again.

What a wonderful cake!  It is the best pineapple upside down cake I have ever made and it was so easy.  It was wonderfully unique being a two-layer cake.  Everyone should try this cake.

I followed the recipe (except for cooking time thank goodness) and it needs some work. The top wasn’t pretty. All of the brown sugar and butter covered the pineapple and cherries. Next time, I think I will put the pineapple and cherries down first, then the coconut (probably a bit less of it), and then the brown sugar and melted butter. I didn’t have enough juice, or as many pineapple rings as I wanted for decorating (an 8oz can is only four rings?!), so next time I’ll get a bigger can of rings and that should give enough juice. I cooked it for 30 minutes at 350 which was still too much. I like the idea of a layered pineapple upside down cake, but I’m not happy with this one just yet. Thinking I might also add an extra 8oz can of crushed pineapple into the cake batter.

This was the easiest Pineapple Upside-Down Cake I have ever made.  I worked in bakeries for years, and am super picky when it comes to baked goods.  Normally, I hate anything made with a box mix, but had to whip up something fast.  Made just as directed, no changes.  Turned out great.  Moist, delicious, easy.  Thought there was no way it was going to come out of pan, but did!  Ok...one change....used regular size 20 oz can of sliced pineapples.  Used rings for top of one cake, and just diced up others to cover other side in place of crushed pineapple.  Worked great.  My hubby likes sweet stuff, and thought may need icing....but plenty sweet without.

Very easy recipe. I used a Duncan Hines pineapple cake mix.
As suggested from others, I increased the butter to 1/2  cup. 
The bake time was also way off for my electric oven. Over an hour! Used a thin wooden kabob stick and  tested every 5  minutes after the  60  minutes. I cooled the 11/13 glass pan till the bottom was warm to the touch, and  it popped over with no problem.

All 7 of us loved it!  I didn't want to fiddle with the 2-layer thing - we just wanted something sweet and yummy for a quick dessert.  This fit the bill.  I made mine in a 9x13 and just used a can of chunk pineapple since that's what I happened to have (not 2 cans as in recipe).  I added my melted butter, brown sugar, coconut, then threw in my pineapple chunks and cherries and tried to spread them out evenly.  Topped with the yellow cake mix made with pineapple juice, and baked as per recipe instructions.  It came out delish!  I'm definitely be making it again.

Made without coconut as I wasn't in the mood.

Used 2 rings pineapple and some juice from the can.  Added to pint of fresh whipped cream with 1/3 sugar and used between the layers.  

Had my boyfriend bring some to work.  His boss said he will marry me if he does'nt.

Very easy and tasty.  I had some fresh pineapple to use up so I cut it into chunks, skipped the cherries and made two separate 8 in. square pans cakes.  One to give away, one to keep.  Baked approx. 25-30 mins.  I have tried yellow cake mix, pineapple and French vanilla.  All of them have come out great.  I liked it served warm with whipped cream..yumm!

I also turned this into a 9x13 cake. I used Betty Crocker Golden butter recipe, his brand has pudding in the mix and called for butter not oil. Been years since I’d made this type of cake and it appealed to me as my husband loves coconut. I’m not a fan of it so I just put it on half. I used a 1/2 cup of melted butter on the bottom as suggested and it was perfect. As for the 8 oz of pineapple I mixed it into the cake batter and poured it over the pineapples and cherries. It turned out incredibly fluffy and moist. What a hit! I’ll be sure to make it again. Snuck a bite and almost ate 1/4 of the cake. I’m also 9 months pregnant. Make it, you won’t be disappointed.

Very delicious. I definitely recommend getting a GOOD cake mix. If you can't find a good cake mix then just make it from scratch. I used the Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow Cake Mix and it was not good. I thought that the pineapple would soak through the cake and overwhelm its store bought, fake vanilla taste but no. It still persisted. It was still amazing though. 

Changes for next time: make a pineapple jam to put in between the two layers, squeeze more juice out of the pineapple before putting down in pan, more butter and brown sugar on the edges (the crispy sugar on the edges were phenomenal).

Also, despite what some reviewers said, I found the cake even more delicious the next day! The refrigeration really made the pineapple really delicious and gave the cake time to soak in the flavors without going mushy. 10/10

I didn’t care for the two layers as much as the regular recipe, regular is especially good cooked in an iron skillet.

As noted before, butter cake is a must!  I did a 13x9 and did a center layer of crushed pineapple but cut the qty in half to 1/2C to reduce the overall moisture. The coconut is the bomb. Totally different cake!, thanks so much.

Followed recipe using DH Golden Butter cake mix. I put both pans in the oven at the same time but the bottom layer cooked faster and was done in 25 min. Top layer took another 5 minutes. Definitely check your cakes early. 
Cooled 20 min and they came out of the pans easily, but the top did break a bit when trying to get on top of the bottom layer. Still tasty though!

I've made this twice, first with ring pineapple without coconut.  This time I used crushed pineapple plus coconut.  
Also I used Duncan Hines pineapple cake mix both times.  It's great both ways.  This is an excellent recipe and each person that ate it LOVED it.  I used a 9 x 13 pan and baked for 40 minutes at 350.

This cake turned out great. I use the Bundt cake pan to make it. I cut the pineapples in half and layered it in the bottom of the Bundt cake with half a pineapple and a cherry in between around the entire Pan.  I doubled the butter and sugar for the bottom of the pan. And I omitted the coconut just because I don’t have any available in my pantry.I did as other uses suggested and poured half of the cake mix then a layer of the crushed pineapples and then the other half of the cake mix.And I did add a Full of Rum to the cake mix batter for good luck. I only let it cool 10 minutes before I inverted it. This cake was delicious warm.

Beautiful dessert and delicious. After putting the top layer on put the pan over the cake for 20 or 30 minutes to avoid cracking.

Never had a two layer cake like this one!  I will be making it again!  Moist and so flavorful,  I was dubious of the coconut, but it all paired beautifully.  Definitely a try me cake.  Be sure to keep refrigerated if it lasts more than a couple of days!

This was easy to make.  I made it in a 9 x 13 glass baking dish.  It took about 40 minutes in the oven and flipped it out after about 20 minutes.  My family loved it and I'll surely make it again!

I used no coconut, less brown sugar, substituted crushed pineapple and baked as one layer in a cast iron skillet.  It was great!  Will definitely make this recipe again.

I love this recipe. It's always a big hit. I do mine a little differently. I use a bundt cake pan. I spread the butter all over the pan, sprinkle the brown sugar, coconut, then add the coconut rings, I cut the remaining rings and put halves around the sides. Then Cherries in the middle of the pineapples. Then mixing the cake mix I use the Pineapple juice for the water and add a can of crushed Pineapple right in the mix. Add to the pan and bake for about 40 minutes. Cool. Transfer to a plate.

This is so good! I had never made a pineapple upside down cake before and I'm so glad this was the recipe I used. I did forget the coconut but not a big fan of it anyway. I used a Pillsbury Golden Butter cake, took out at 25 mins, let cool 15 mins, then put pan back on top layer so it would not crack as was suggested by other reviewers. My son couldn't wait for it to cool. I asked him if I should make this again and he said most definitely.

Excellent dessert.  I used 20 oz of crushed pineapple by mistake and it was just fine.  I also added coconut extract instead of the shredded coconut because people think they don't like coconut!

I just made this but I made a few adjustments. I used the pineapple flavored cake mix from Duncan Hines, added ¼ cup of crushed pineapple in the batter, and lightly toasted my coconut. I also drizzled some caramel sauce over it 

 Is can't wait til it cools down so I can taste it

I made this for a family get together, the kids and family loved it. Me not so much as I would have like for the cake to be moist.  The taste of the cake was good, but not as moist as I would like for it to be. Next time I will look for a home made  recipe, not one from the box. Followed recipe as written, added a little extra juice.  Probably will not make again.

I made this recipe but made some changes. instead of yellow cake mix i made Betty Crocker  Lemon cake mix and added lemon zest and juice of the lemon to the cake mix, didnot use the pineapple juice as in the recipe. Also I baked the bottom layer in a deep dish pie plate so that the bottom layer was a bit wider than the top. i omitted the coconut and just added some chopped walnuts to the bottom layer. everybody lovedd it! it was my husbands choice for his birthday cake!!

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday using all organic ingredients.  No cherries. Looks and smells great. Party isn't until tomorrow.  Therefore, haven't tasted it yet. Tip for cake cracking.: I learned this at a decorating class. Wrap the sides of the pan with damp cotton cloth. Wilton makes wraps for cake pans, but I made my own. I cut old cotton towel double the hight of the pan. Folded it in half, dampened it, wrapped it around pan, and secured wth safety pin. Your cake will cook evenly. No hump in the middle and no dark sides..

Good basic recipe but it became delicious when I made a few changes. I used a 9x13 pan. Put in butter, brown sugar, coconut then a drained 20oz can of sliced pineapple in single layer. Topped that with a yellow butter cake mix using the 1 c of the drained juice. I did not add any crushed pineapple nor cherries because I found they made the cake way too sweet. Baked at 350 for 35 min. Remove from pan after 15 min to prevent sticking. It was fantastic and everyone loved it. I would give it more stars, but I had to make too many changes.

I prepared the cake as written except for having used Duncan Hines Butter Cake mix. It was very dry. And as many have noted, in order to cover the top layer with pineapple you need to have a 16 oz can of pineapple slices. An 8 oz. can only yields 4 slices. I won't make this again without a lot of tweaking.

This was a smash hit for Easter dessert yesterday! My family and friends totally raved about it. So much so, in fact,that everyone tried stealing the remainder of the cake when they left! I made a few changes; a packaged pineapple cake mix for instance,and 4 eggs; following the package directions. It's AWESOME!!! Will be keeping this one for sure.

It came out very good except the pineapple slices did not show on the top of the cake.  I added another layer of slices to the top to make the presentation a little better.

Made as stated except I used a yellow butter cake mix and added more pineapple rings to cover the whole bottom of the pan.  This was good but not outstanding.  Maybe extra butter and brown sugar as others have stated would take this to the next level.

I liked this and it was pretty easy to do.  I used a whole stick of butter, ½ a stick in each pan. I added coconut to the bottom layer too.  I also put some pecan halves on the top layer before I laid down the coconut layer. I was going to use a regular yellow cake mix, but I saw a pineapple flavored cake mix, so I used that instead.  In my oven they were done in 35 minutes not the 40-50.    I did not let it sit 20 minutes before turning out.  I turned them immediately.  Next time I will make sure I spread the batter a little better as my cake was a bit lopsided. That is OK though it still tasted good :)

Oh YUM. My daughter and I made our first pineapple upside cake with this recipe and it was gone in minutes. The cake was a little soggy under the pineapple, but pretty sure it was user error--didn't drain pineapple enough. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

I can't believe I forgot the butter and this still turned out great! I baked mine in a bundt pan and it turned out moist and delicious, although I will try it in the 2 rounds next time. I will definitely make this again!

It's a keeper.  I used the Pillsbury golden butter recipe cake mix and the cakes baked 30 minutes. When I turned the first layer over some brown sugar and pineapple stuck, but it was easy enough to just spread it back on the layer.  I also did the same with the bit of brown sugar and coconut left behind in the top layer pan - but the pineapples and cherries turned fine.  We had ours with a bit of cool whip on top.  Yummmmmy!

Absolute best upside down cake I've ever had!!!  I did make some tweaks based on personal preference.  Used apple sauce instead of the oil in the cake mix, added the coconut to the bottom layer with the crushed pineapple, used about 1/2 of a stick of melted butter and almost 3/4 cup (eyeballed) brown sugar for the bottom layer (wanted an ooey gooey middle "filling", and extra pineapple.  Added halved cherries to the bottom layer as well, just spread out with the brown sugar, pineapple, coconut and butter..... The top layer I used just a little extra butter and brown sugar.  Also added a couple drops of coconut extract to the batter.  SOOOO good!  Took it to a potluck lunch, and had to keep watch over it, as guests kept picking up the platter before dessert time, and trying to go hide it in their vehicles......... There wasn't a single crumb left over!!!

This was fantastic. I used a cherry chip cake mix that I had on hand, followed the directions on everything else - super yum! Hubby who turned his nose up at the idea of a "fruit cake" went back for (larger) seconds. The coconut/brown sugar mixture makes it. Thanks!

I prepared exactly as recipes called for and it was good, but not GREAT.  Definitely a little dry.  I would try again but I'd just prepare the cake as called for (not substituting pineapple juice) and I would use a single layer instead of two.  I'd also recommend some sort of pineapple or creamy icing to add moisture.

This is similar to my mama's recipe.  I omitted the cherries & coconut ad used crushed pineapple.  I used the pineapple juice from the can on place of water and added tons of brown sugar.  I only made a small round 9inch but it was yummy NOM NOM.  See my posted pic.

This turned out amazing. We used a 20 oz can of pineapple rings instead of the two different 8 oz cans. I didn't put any cherries on the top because I couldn't find any at the store. Will use again!

This recipe was easy however the phot suggests a rectangular cake rather than two round layers. When all is said and done it is essentially two cakes and layering is not necessary. Also, I would recommend layering the coconut after the pineapple is in the pan and to use unsweetened coconut. The cake is prettier and less sweet. My guests loved this cake.

Sensational moist cake, that's a breeze to prepare.  I toasted the coconuts for 15 mins at  350* and it really added another flavor profile that blended perfectly; also added coconut and vanilla extract.  Baked for 45-50 mins and inverted the cake immediately.  I prefer not to layer the cake.  Will make it again!

This is a great looking, even better tasting cake. I will make this again and again! It turned out perfectly and looks like it took much, much more effort. GREAT RECIPE!

Easy to make, Taste was good, but it was much too small. The picture looked HUGE. Better double up next time.

Very easy very good. Only think I'd say would be to let the cakes cool a while longer so they don't fall apart when you stack them. My top layer fell apart as I was stacking it, it was still really delicious.

Maybe I shouldn't judge because I'm just not a big fan of pineapple upside down cake, but I'm gonna anyway...It was just okay.  The cake part needed more.  It was a bit dry and flavorless.  The pineapple/brown sugar/coconut was a good combination, and I really liked that part, but the rest of the cake was just blah.  Maybe some crushed pineapple in the cake would have made it more moist.

The first time I made this cake I followed the recipe exactly; it was delicious, but stuck to the pan and fell apart. I suspected it was due to the melted butter used to coat the pans. So the second time, I used shortening to coat the sides, then used the melted butter on the bottom and some on the sides as directed. I also added some extra crushed pineapple to both layers. This time the cake did not break apart, but most of the coconut stuck to the bottom of the pans. Because the coconut is so delicious and adds to the flavor I scrapped it off and spread it around on the top. If anyone has made this cake and found a way to keep the coconut from sticking I would love to read your review. This cake recipe is a keeper.

GREAT CAKE... I am cooking challenged!  The cake came out PERFECT thanks to the suggestions and recipe.  Used larger pan.  Cake was picture perfect and came out of the pan perfectly.  I removed about 5-7 minutes after taking out of the oven.

I don't know if it's something we did, or if others have the same problem, but the top layer fell apart after we inverted it. It was really good though, and we'll definitely make it again, just don't know if we'll try 2 layers next time or not.

I just finished baking this cake.. I've never made a Pineapple Upside-Down Cake so I think it came out pretty good for a first time. Kudos to the simple recipe.. I followed one of the reviewers tips and was checking the cakes after about 25 minutes... ended up baking them for a total of 35 minutes and after putting the top layer on it started cracking!! A little peice fell off and I ate it and mmmmmm the cake is WONDERFUL!! Anyway, I put the pan back on the top layer because reveiwers were saying it stops the cracking so we'll see... But next time I think I'll bake them for the recommended 40-50 minutes...

AWESOME! I fixed this for the first time because a friend of mine was having a birthday and this is his favorite cake so I figured I would give it a shot! I decided to make two so my husband could be my guinea pig because I didn't want to give him a just "okay kinda cake" for his special day! I took some of the other bakers advice and used the pineapple cake mix.  I only deviated from the recipe a little.  I used the the juice from the cherries in addition to the juice from the pineapples to make up the "water" for the cake mix recipe - WOW! My husband ate a piece while it was still warm and made yummy sounds throughout the whole slice of cake AND gave me extra kisses for baking an extra one! LOL

AWESOME!  I couldn't stop eating it myself.  My family loved it as well.  The only thing I did differently was add 2 8oz cans of crushed pineapple for the middle layer, only because it seemed a little thin and we love pineapple! So that added the perfect touch to an already fantastic recipe!

This cake tasted good and was easy, but it really fell apart when I tried to cut it.  I could have done something wrong but I'm pretty sure I followed the directions 100%.  I'll probably keep looking for a perfect pineapple upside down cake recipe.

This turned out so well! I baked it in a 9X13 pan and it had a beautiful appearance.  It didn't fall apart at all, although it was crumbly to eat.  Everyone loved it, claiming it was "off the hook!" Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This recipe turned out ok, but not very moist.  I used the butter recipe like suggested, but still not great.  I like a lot of the brown sugar/butter topping & this didn't really do it for me.

Very good recipe.  The only problem is getting the second layer on top.  I inverted onto a plate, took a spatula and slid it over onto the first layer.
Big hit at any function I've taken it to. Thanks for the idea!!!

We made this cake, and it turned out pretty good, but it could have been better.  We made it in a 9 by 13 pan, and skipped the crushed pineapple.  When we tried to cut the cake, it kind of fell apart.  I don't know if this was because of the cake mix that we used, or something else, but that's okay.  It tasted great and was a hit at my sister's birthday party.

A good, moist cake, but very difficult to make it look good!  Having the two layers makes the top layer crack very easily, so this one will take a little more practice.  A good family-gathering cake though.
Thanks!

Finally a pineapple upside-down cake that turned out! I was impressed with how simple this was to make. I omitted the cherries and the coconut and I used a can of crushed pineapple in place of the rings. The cake was very moist and not too sweet.

I converted to a 13x9 and doubled the sugar and butter for the topping.  It was a good recipe, the cake wa super moist with the juice in it, but I wasn't as impressed by the entire thing as I thought I would be.  Even though we all like it, we didn't love it, so I'll be trying a different recipe next time.  A big plus though, it was super easy, so it would make a great potluck cake.

I made this for my husband's birthday, but I used the "yellow cake" recipe by julia instead of the boxed cake- no trans fat!  This cake is very easy and pretty, and so tasty!  My husband wants it for every birthday from now on.

this was great. a delicious recipe that looked beautiful and time consuming but was easy as pie. i left out the cherries because i don't like them and i didn't have any coconut, but it was just as delicious without those two ingredients. wonderful! thanks alot for this simple but great recipe.

Very Moist.  I accidently purchased the tidbits instead of the crushed pineaple, but it still came out fine.  Although I love coconut in German Choc Cake, the coconut did not do much for me in this recipie.  And as much as I love pecans, they surprisingly did not add much to the flavor of the cake either.

Followed the directions exactly:  nice moist cake BUT presentation is horrible.  Impossible to line-up the layers just perfect and top layer cracked and fell apart.  Also, not enough pineapple topping including in the recipe.  Will NOT be making this again.

However, when I put the second layer on top of the first, it just fell apart and I had to wrap it with plastic wrap to hold it together (perhaps I didn't let the cake cool long enough before I took it out of the pan?)  I will probably make this again, but, like others, will use a 9x13 pan.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

My father-in-law requested a pineapple upside down cake for his birthday.  I had never made one but of course I wanted to give it a try.  I made this recipe and I could not believe how well it turned out!  It looked pretty as well!

I started using this recipe about 6 months ago and it has become one of the most requested cakes I bake. Moist, good flavor, everything you could ask for in cake! Thank you!

A lovely recipe that is sure to please the whole family  :)  It's nice and easy to make, but it turns out so pretty when it's all finished.  Will be sure to make it again.  I didn't use any coconut, because there wasn't any on hand, but I think it may've turned out better without it.

THIS CAKE WAS SO GOOD IT WAS GONE IN 2 DAYS AND I WAS ASKED TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE. IT WAS EASY TO MAKE. I SERVED IT WARM WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM. HOWEVER INSTEAD OF USING YELLOW CAKE MIX I USED PINEAPLLE CAKE MIX.

well, i tried for the 2-layer cake but, like many others, it didn't work!  how do you land that 2nd layer perfectly on top of the 1st??  i could see how pretty it would've been, had it worked!  it was still really good, but the cake part was a little bland (i did use the butter cake mix like others suggested). i think next time i'll do what my grandma did & and, after the layers are baked, poke holes in them and pour pineapple juice on top so that it seeps down into the cake.  i did use more crushed pineapple than it called for, and more brown sugar too - wanted to be sure it had enough "glaze"!  i will make again, but perhaps in a 9x13 dish!  but then what the heck do you flip it out onto so you can see the pretty pineapple rings??  thanks, donna!

I made this for Easter and it was simple and tasty enough (I'd probably give it 4 stars for taste alone) but looked horrendous - it is near impossible to get a two layer cake to be perfectly even and level, especially when it has no icing to cover up errors and you only have one shot at placing the top layer correctly - mine was slighlty lopsided and colapsed in the middle when we cut it. In the future, I will stick to one layer pineapple upsidedown cakes

I made this for my hubby on Valentine's Day. It was my first time making pineapple upside-down cake. It turned out great. It was even better the next day. Then the day after that I had a piece & it was even better. I was expecting it to dry out but it seemed to moisten as the days went by. Yumm, Yumm!

Loved it. Great presentation when using sliced pineapple pieces for the top half and each piece has a cherry in the center. It really looked beautiful. Taste is ok, i expected a little more pineapply taste. Will try to add more pineapple juice next time.

It's different than the 'traditional' skillet P.U.D. cake, but it's was FABULOUS. It makes a very stunning dessert too. I loved the addition of the coconut. YUM!

Quick and easy -- I actually made this with my friend's 9 year-old and she thought it was a lot of fun.  It tasted good, but I've had better tasting Pineapple Upside down cake.
