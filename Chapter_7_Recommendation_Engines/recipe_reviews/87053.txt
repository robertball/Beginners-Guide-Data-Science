Just like I remember it from growing up in Sheboygan County! Although I now live in Lancaster, PA, I still only GRILL my brats, often serve them soaked in beer and ALWAYS insist that they are served on hard rolls. Everyone who has tried them loves them.

A couple of additional comments: If they are available in your area, choose only JOHNSONVILLE Brats... a product of Johnsonville in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. Every serious brat connoisseur knows that no other brand compares. :)  

Also, a slow cooker or crock pot works great for keeping the brats warm until serving time. When the brats come of the grill, throw them into the slow cooker beer and onion bath until the rest of the food is ready. Enjoy!

Now, these were some GOOD brats. There was another recipe I had tried from this site, but my Wisconsin born 'n bred hubby liked this one better. We used harder rolls than hot dog buns, and twice the onions. Sure didn't need ketchup or mustard. This is one I was told to file AT ONCE! Thank you, PBFITZ!

AMAZING!!! My bofriend and his little sis (both born and raised in Sheboygan, WI) absolutly loved it! After I grilled the brats for 30 mim. (until the skin was very crispy), I put them in crock pot and covered with beer sauce! It doesn't really matter how long you keep them in crock pot. They only get bettter with time! Thanks for sharing PBFITZ!!

Proof there is more than one way to cook a brat!  Our family has always done a low and slow simmer in beer and onions first - usually whatever is on hand  mixed with at least one bottle of a Leinenkugel dark , then grill and then toss them back in the beer bath if we are cooking a lot of them.  The bun is crucial - a Sheboygan Hard Roll is the ONLY way to eat these - and generously buttered!  A good stone ground mustard - NEVER ketchup, and Johnsonville, Meisfelds or Sheboygan Bratwurst Company (they will ship brats AND hardrolls across the US) are the top three. Cold beer and potato salad, Milwaukee Dill's, and a Packer game will make it even more authentic :)

Being a born and raised Sheboyganite, I was raised on brats (double brat) that is. A brat always has a companion in a semmel roll; hard roll made in Sheboygan and still made locally. I no longer eat brats (too high in cholesterol and family history of colon cancer) but my family enjoys them all year long-grilled outdoors even in a snowstorm. We have many wonderful brat makers in Sheboygan county but one of the finer ones is Miesfeld's-has recieved many awards. Johnsonville is for out-of-towners-really  don't know what a GOOD brat is. Always add beer and sliced onions to the cooked brats. ENJOY!

If one is in the Midwest or in Germnay, one NEVER EVER puts ketchup on bratwurst. It is considered a mortal sin to put ketchup on bratwurst in Germany!!!

Tried this recipe and loved it in every way.  We do it just a tad differently and it tastes just as good.  Parboiled the brats in water and beer, then grilled them.  Put the onions (four large ones sliced) into an aluminum pan with 2 bottles of beer and equal amounts of chicken stock.  Put the brats in with this mixture and then put the pan on the grill, indirect heat, covered with foil.  Kept the grill at no more than 300' and the brats stayed great for hours!  Just increase the amount of onions, beer and stock based on how many brats you need.  Call this our "brat tub" and it is asked for at every family outing! Serve it with good cole slaw and great rolls and it's a meal fit for a royal family!!

Yum, yum, yum...I love my brats!  I am, too, from the Sheboygan area and this is the way I make my brats.  Now in the South 30 years, we can finally get Johnsonville brats.  The only thing wrong is..... we do not have decent bakeries and oh, how I miss a good Sheboygan hardroll for my brat!  The best ever!

Great change of pace for cooking beer brats. Loved the recipe, dark beer is the best way to go but I have also tried it with cheaper/regular beer and its come out good. Thanks for sharing!

This is exactly how we grilled our brats when I was growing up in Sheboygan back in the 1960's.  Now I keep the tradition alive here in Texas.  Best way to cook brats!!!

Sad to say but never add the pleasure of tasting a Sheboygan brat. :( So cannot compare, but nonetheless, these are excellent in bold full flavor! Used Johnsonville brats, grilling 8 - 9 minutes per side, on low heat, turning a quarter turn each time. Ended up with perfectly crisp brown brats, juicy inside. Used Guinness beer and followed recipe exactly. (I did add a few small dashed crushed red pepper flakes). Stirred in a good sized pat of butter when I added the brats to the onion beer sauce. Served on toasted pretzel buns (spread cut side with butter and grilled cut side down until golden brown and toasted.) YUM!!!!

Great!  Though do yourself a favor and DO NOT USE STANDARD HOT DOG BUNS!!!  You MUST use sheboygan hard rolls, aka semmel rolls.  You won't regret it!

Great recipe, but be sure to use a good quality beer for the best flavor - no light stuff.  Also, we always serve brats with sauerkraut although not everyone likes it.  It's right there with mustard and onions as far as condiments go.

I to live in the Sheboygan area, and have had brats since I was a kid back in the '40's.  My dad always told me that only brown mustard goes on pork.  Being of German decent, I prefer the German Dusseldorf mustard.  We love our City Bakery hard rolls that are still made in their  brick ovens.  Always have to fry an extra brat for the cook to eat right off the grill.  The rest of the brats go into the pot with 3 cans of beer and lots of onions and 1/2 stick of butter.  Also put any burgers into this sauce too....yummmmm!  Sheboygan is known as ther brat capital of the world, and we have a huge brat days that over 50 thousand come down to the park, right after the best parade of the season. It is held the 1st Fri. evening in August and all day Saturday.  Come join the fun!

This is a good recipe, but the brats tend to fall apart after cooking them for so long in the crock pot. It is super easy and doesn't take much assembly time.

Ahhh, what a beautiful brat this cooks up. Flavorful, tender, moist, perfect. I've made them according to this recipe without the grilling and they're still delicious.

We thought these were very good. I loved the flavor it gave the brats but something about the beer simmered onions had a bit of an aftertaste to them that I didn't love but I still really enjoyed it! I am sure the beer you use has a huge impact in how the onions come out, but overall this was very easy and very tasty!

Juicy and 100% delicious! I usually boil before I grill, but never again. As soon as you bite into the brat the juice overflows into your mouth with greatness! I used cheap beer and it still came out fantastic. Next time I will upgrade to a better beer, just to see how much better it can be, but it's awesome the way it is! Well done!

I too am from the Sheboygan area, now living in Colorado Springs. We only grill brats on a charcoal grill. First we grill the hamburgers and put them in the beer sauce. By the time they are done the coals are just right for the brats. And of course you have to butter those buns for the whole Sheboygan experience.

We have a family member who wants nothing to do with alcohol, so we use an N/A beer (O'Douls,etc) and we also add butter to the beer & onions.  Nothing you'd make a regular meal out of because of all the fat, etc. But every once in a while, they are very tasty!  Gotta have the hard roll as well.

We have made many times.  Mostly, these turn our wonderfully.  A few times, there has been a bitterness to the flavour.  Not sure if it's beer selection.  Very very good.

After tasting, I added extra butter and some chicken broth to the beer and onions.  I then simmered my grilled brats for ages... the longer they simmered the better they got!  I have never tried anything like this with brats but I am a new believer!  The brats, along with the simmered onions and beer sauce and a little mustard, were just amazing, I couldn't stop snitching bites long after dinner was over.  Delish!

I tried this method because the cooking of the brats was reversed from my normal method thinking this method is faster.  End results were not as flavorful as my regular method.  I fully cook the brats in the beer/onion/garlic/butter mixture then brown up on the grill for presentation, just a lot more flavor.

These were good. I've done brats lots of ways, and they all come out good. 
Personally, if you can't get them right, you must be some kind of dope.

Very delicious recipe. I am from New York, and I am not big on brats. But my husband loved them. The only thing I did different was I roasted some sliced red peppers separately and added them to the onion/beer mixture. Everyone said that was a nice touch, but again, we are from New York and not experts on brats.

Best brats ever!  So says my brother who, until tasting these , claimed that the "only" way to grill brats was to boil them in beer first.  As sons of a former Green Bay Packer who have tailgated in the Lambeau Field parking lot several times, the argument was heated, but the outcome was never in doubt.  These brats from FBFitz won the day!  They are now a staple at our  family gatherings, and gain converts among our friends.

Try serving them as I do, on grilled Chef John's hot dog buns ( on this site) and watch your guests' faces light up.

These were alright.  We tried using with Newcastle Brown Ale. I  enjoyed the onions and even added mushrooms and that was really good but I thought there was a funny after taste with it- but I am thinking it may just be the beer since I am not a huge beer fan.. not sure but it wasn't my favorite.  Husband thought it was alright.

Grilled Brats and then marinated in Beer and butter (onions and garlic, if you so choose) are truly a little taste of paradise.  I came from a small village just 2 miles outside of Sheboygan, WI.   Like so many others in this area we know that only Johnsonville brats appeal to those with German background.  We grill the brats carefully so they do not burst, then immerse them in the hot beer and butter.  By the way, hamburgers do well in this marinade, too. Thanks PBFITZ for the reminder of home!

Excellent way to do brats.  Had to pan grill the brats since it started to rain!  I used Vidalla onions, but next time I'll try a stronger onion.

Hubby grilled these for lunch today and they were pretty tasty!  I used Guinness in the sauce and the flavor went very well with the brats.  We'll be having these again!  Served on hotdog buns with mustard.

We wanted to take advantage of one of the first sunny, warm days in Seattle so we grilled out. We were happy to make brats but weren't sure about boiling the brats AFTER we cooked them (we had always boiled them before)... however, to our surprise, this worked very well. Also, we didn't think that 30 minutes to cook on the grill was right... but, he flipped and turned for a good 25 minutes before we thought they were done. The trick is to cook them over the cooler spots and move them around alot otherwise they would have turned into lumps of coal. We were so excited to eat them that we forgot to add red peppers when we were sauteing the onions like we had intended, but we'll try that next time. Also, I'd add more onions next time.

Excellent!  These really impressed a potluck group from St. Louis.  After grilling, we cut them in half & soaked in crock pot w/beer, onions, garlic etc.  Does not need condiments!

Oh I should have taken a photo like I usually do, but they didn't last long enough to photograph.  I used 4 brats with the regular amount of onions and other ingredients and they were gone so quickly you would never have known I cooked dinner.  Fabulous recipe and easy to make.  Thanks!

It really irritates me when people talk down on someone for using an item such as catsup, usually calling it a sin our taboo. It's your tastebuds, do as you please. I will eat brats with or without catsup. Usually one of each.

I'm not sure if you need to be from Wisconsin or Germany to enjoy bratwurst. This was my first go at it. I reduced the recipe to 3 and followed it carefully, but did not care for it. I guess it's a personal thing.

I caramelize the onion by slow cooking them for about 1 hour then add garlic and deglaze with beer. Then that all goes in a foil pan that's covered on the grill and slow cooked for at least 30mins. Brats and beer sauce are incredible.

I use Tofurky Veggie Sausage links or Chicken Hot Dogs and an ale instead of a stout and it still comes out really tasty.  Kilbasa is the only Tofurky version by us but I hear they have a Brat version too.  I also noticed I like them better when they are completely boiled in the beer instead of grilled first.  Seriously good recipe

These were decent, but not as awesome as I expected, maybe because of my beer choice? I used a high quality, German dark beer, lager style. The mixture was really bitter. I had hoped springing for a more expensive beer would pay off, but it didn't. I had to salt the mixture quite a bit to make it edible. The brats shrunk a lot. And I'm not sure the purpose of leaving the brats on the grill for so long. There are done in at least half the time called for in the recipe. As a non brat aficionado, I've enjoyed reading the reviews from the "brat snobs."

I followed the recipe to a "T". No taste whatsoever. Dietz and Watson green pepper and onion franks puts this to shame. Maybe because I'm not from Wisconsin, I just don't get brays.

I tried a couple other brat recipes from this site and found this one to be my favorite. The onions are super buttery and it was just a tasty brat. A keeper!

I prefer cooking my brats the opposite way.  I boil my brats in beer, onion, garlic & seasoning salt, then I grill them.  It seems to hold the flavor a little more.  Growing up in Sheboygan, I've always used Johnsonville brats, which living out of state today is conveniently the only kind really available in my area.
