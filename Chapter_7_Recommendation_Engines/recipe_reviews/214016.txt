Very close to the true uzbek recipe (I'm originally from Uzbekistan).
Agree with previous reviewers abour julienned carrots. Another thing we do differently: put raw garlic on top the rice (squeeze it in the rice in the center) before covering everything with water. Pour water over a tablespoon or wooden spatula to ensure even distribution over rice (to avoid making large holes in the rice). Cover, and when it starts boiling remove the cover to let water evaporate. Then cover again until rice is ready. Cook on slow heat.
Also, we use round rice rather than long rice but in any case avoid sticky rice.
The main key to the true uzbek plov: spices. In addition to what you already mention you need turmerick (it gives plov its golden colour), carum seeds (or caraway seeds), cumin can be used regular and black cumin for more flavor, some use paprika. 
Comment to other reviews:
Cranberries is a poor substitute to barberries - you need something very sour.
There is no butter in the plov.
Serve with shikarop: a salad with finally sliced (almost shredded) tomatos, shredded sweet onions, oil, salt, pepper, cilantro, and paprika. Enjoy!

I made the Lamb and Rice.  The most difficult part was trying to find barberries.  I used dried cranberries instead.  The dish is OUTSTANDING.  It took time, but was worth it.  thanks, Sarah

I happened upon this from the front page and what you're probably missing is fenugreek seasoning, you add this after you add the water to the rice right on top. Also, the carrots traditionally are julienned not grated.

So to make this more authentic use broth instead of water (beef or chicken). It gives the rice a richer flavor.

Also, I add a little butter right before I throw in the rice. It really improves the flavor. this is a classically rich dish, so the flavor of butter takes it a long way. 

I thinly slice my carrots... this is the traditional way and does a lot for the texture.

If you don't like lamb cut up chuck roast will do, or any marbelized meat.

following this recipe exactly for cooking times and so forth, everything was burned and unedible.  Very disappointed.  Lamb is not cheap either.

Very authentic,you can also try bone in peaces of lamb, that is sold in Costco. Bone will give much flavor to rice. Uzbek eat plov without utensils meat on the bone less messy this way.

I loved it! Very good! At first I was scared that there were a lot of onions and carrots, but it turned out very good. It tastes really good, and really easy to make. Amazing!

I used beef, since it was the only meat I had at the time, as well as generous amount of olive oil. I also used pre-mixed spices for plov that I bought in a Russian store. BTW, you can find dried barberries there as well for cheap. This is a good recipe!

I have tried this recipe few times, always the result was astonishing.
I have used the review comments to improve, cranberries and barberries are really different, I have used sour cherries once as well with some sour sultanas. Grated carrots leave extra water, which wasn't useful so thinly sliced way is give the better result.

We made this after living in neighboring Kyrgyzstan for several years. We added a little extra salt, pealed the garlic cloves rather than whole heads, left out the barberries and it turned out great!

This recipe is fantastic, I made it with bone in chunks of lamb (mutton?) and cranberries. I just finished eating the reheated leftovers and I think it was better than the first time around.

You can use pomegranate seeds instead of barberries, add them when you serving in each plate on top.

The bottom was a little burnt but definitely edible. The rest was absolutely delicious. The times in the recipe were a little off but as long as you keep an eye on the food, it turns out really good. This was also my first time cooking with lamb so I'm glad it came out good. I substituted dried cranberries for barberries and the added sweetness was very welcome.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it as written (okay, I added chopped almonds) and it was fantastic.  My husband said I could make this anytime... and I plan to!  I'm looking forward to trying this with different veggies, dried fruits, nuts, etc.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love plov, especially Uzbek plov. This is a very authentic recipe, the plov is just absolutely delicious. I have made it with lamb (my favorite), beef, pork and vegetarian - it is really good no matter how you make it. My kids always ask for seconds and thirds, and it is just as good two days later as it is when you first make it.

This is one of my favorite dishes and everyone seems to have a slightly different variation. I like to add about 1/2 tsp of paprika, turmeric, and tarragon each to the spice mixture.

Amazing! It was just like my mom used to make:). ( I am originally from Russia:) . My very American husband and son loved it too. They are both extremely picky eaters. It was really easy to make and super delicious. I did not change anything and it turned out great!

I doubled it , used 2 lb. ground lamb, & julienned the carrots & added 1/4 c. turmeric as suggested by one reviewer. I did not have the bayberries on hand, but will definitely try the recipe with them next time.  This recipe was very easy & a hit with my family. This could easily be a good potluck meal or dinner for guests.

This recipe is accurate, and delicious but should not suggest whole black peppercorns to be used. They are too spicy when eaten and pepper should be ground instead of used as whole. This dissapointed many who liked the dish.

Outstanding!!! I've had my eye on this recipe a while after I heard about it on a documentary. Just made it today and I'm just... In love! So savory, delicious and satisfying. Followed directions and added turmeric, Caraway and cinnamon based on other reviews. Didn't have coriander so I used a little cardamom. Absolutely delicious. Just use your eyes when cooking this. Add water to deglaze if your meat is sticking and the rice is done when no water is left. Then let it rest off the heat while you clean up. Will make this again and again!! Thank you!!!

I found that the ratio of rice:water was not quite right. Needed to add more water after the first 20 minutes and continue simmering for an additional 15 minutes. Probably needed to use 3.5 cups of water the first time around. I will make Plov again, but I might shop around for other recipes.
Used lamb shoulder.

Super recipe! The real deal. I used jasmine rice as that's all that I had. No difference. Tasted just like my daughter in laws who's Russian. Oh, I did add extra cumin seed. We like the flavor. Will use this again.

Based on the other reviews I added about 1 tablespoons of turmeric. I chopped the carrots because I'm lazy. I used brown rice because that's what I had. This dish was fantastic and really easy to make. It could easily be made with chicken or beef though that wouldn't be authentic. Leftovers were also good.

This is pretty close to some original recipes I used before. May be with a few adjustments: First, I wouldn't recommend using hot water for washing rice. The purpose of washing is to remove the starch and gluten without breaking the delicate cellular structure of the grain. This allows the grain to absorb flavor from the liquid while it cooks. Washing away the starch makes  the rice cook in separate grains. Otherwise starch and gluten form a glue-like substance that cobble grains together. Besides, it brakes the cellular structure of the grain making the rice mushy. Although using hot water accelerates washing away the starch, it can damage the grain.  Be patient and wash it several times in cold water until water drained from the rice becomes transparent. Second, the carrots should be cut into strings with a very sharp knife. Grating carrots will make them too thin and short. Cumin seeds and coriander are essential ingredients for this dish.

I made it for the first time last night, and my husband said they definitely need to be julienned carrots.  I also didn't use barberries (which is my own fault) but tried raisins instead.  I personally really liked the sweetness of the raisins, but my husband said that it's never made this way.  I agree with another reviewer about the cooking time, as well.  I'm so glad I kept a close eye on it while it was cooking because it definitely would've been burned if I stuck to the times listed in this recipe...especially if you are planning on reheating it at some point.  Overall, I think it turned pretty well.  I can only be critical because my husband knows how true Uzbek plov tastes.  I will be trying this recipe again with some adjustments--and maybe some tips from my mother-in-law! ;-)

so I made this recipe after not having made plov in years.  Now i'm Russian and have tasted many a plov...this was by far the easiest recipe and one of the tastiest...even considering that I was missing most of the recommended spices.  so easy and delish!  
Note:  I made it with chicken (deboned but large whole thighs and bone-in legs).

I hate to review this, not having made it exact, but I had leftover lamb which didn't need to cook as long. I added it just before adding the rice so I didn't add that extra half hour of cooking and it came out fine.  This was really delicious and will be my go to "leftover lamb" recipe.

My nephew, daughter, and husband ate every scrap. begged for more. I will have to double this one next time. I didnt have cumin or coriander seeds (just ground) so I halved that, and I didnt have the berries. We just used squeezed lemon to taste. Also, I used half water half beef stock. I will look into the berries for next time! Different and yummy.
