I mixed the hot sauce & salsa into the meat & then made it into a pattie (I only did this for myself, as I thought it would be too hot for the kids) and it wasn't hot at all.  I also used Monterey Pepper Jack to add a kick, now that helped.  Okay burger, sorta plain, but a nice change.  Thanks Tim.

Since vegetarian I used Morningstar Farm Griller patties.  Then topped according to recipe.  Great

I mixed the salsa and tabasco right into the burgers and added a bit of garlic powder and black pepper. I also only did half the tabasco and it was fine. I cooked the burgers on a grill pan until they were almost done, then broiled for around 8 minutes, with the cheese melted on there for the last 3 minutes. Very easy, very tasty.

Very nice!  I seasoned my meat as usual with fresh garlic, onions, salt, pepper, an egg and breadcrumbs.  I also coarsly shredded the cheeses.  I've made this several times; on the grill and in the oven and is always a crowd pleaser.

I guess I just don't enjoy the flavor of salsa on my hamburger... I would have preferred adding the hot sauce, along with a few other ingredients to the burger instead, or leaving the burger plain, and adding the cheese and some grilled onions... anything but the salsa.
Thanks anyway for the post, Tim. It DID sound good...

This is a very easy burger to make. I like that everyone can make the toppings as spicey, or not, as they want depending on personal taste. I think, however, next time I might add more "stuff" to the burger itself. Thanks for the recipe, Tim.

This turned out really good. I did sprinkle some hamburger seasoning over the patties before cooking. I only used half the hot sauce called for as I wasn't sure my husband would like his burger otherwise. As these turned out, he made a comment at the dinner table on how much he liked this dish, so Thanks!

I tweaked this a bit and added the salsa plus a tablespoon or so more...into the hamburger, mixed it well, and then formed patties and cooked it... it was Delicious!!! And talk about moist...and tasty!!  I have  four college students (ALL my children) and they love these burgers...try them, you won't be disappointed.

Simple idea, and very tasty.  A nice change from a plain hamburger!
