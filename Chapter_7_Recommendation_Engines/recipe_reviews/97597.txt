This is the first recipe that I had to give less than 5 stars, and I feel horrible about it.  Unfortunately the recipe leaves out a few pointers and doesn't call for enough cocktail sauce. I ended up using double what the recipe called for.  Also, if you put the chopped lettuce in the salad and don't serve it immediately in a few hours the mixture becomes very watery. I had this for lunch  four days in a row and each day had to drain off the excess water. It was tasty and easy to make.  :)
