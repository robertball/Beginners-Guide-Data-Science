These came out really delicious. However, I only bought 2 pounds of ribs, and I needed a lot more of the dry ingredients to get a good rub.  I just kept adding to the bowl - probably with a tablespoon of each dry ingredient by the end.

YUMMY!  This was easy & so good!  I did as someone suggested & started off with about 1TSP of the dry ingredients & didn't add hot pepper sauce because I didn't have any on hand....cooked for about 6 hours....other than that I followed directions.......fall apart tender!  Friends & family loved it!  Will be having this again!

Diabetic changes: My husband is diabetic- loves barbaque and we are in that portion of the country where barbaque sauces are mopped on and sweet. I found Stubbs' original Bar-B-Q which has 4 gm of sugar and 7 carbs in 2 T. and substitued splenda for the orange juice. Stubbs is spicy so I didn't use the steak seasoning, chili or garlic sauce- did put in 2 bulbs of garlic and used low Na Soy Sauce. It was delicious and my husband was smiling that he had barbeque that didn't send his blood sugars soaring. I am not diabetic and I loved it also...

The  sauce for this recipe was really yummy!  I don't know what went wrong with my ribs though, they tasted like sawdust!  Really dried out.  I had them in the slow cooker for about 9 hours, I don't know if the heat was too high.  Next time I may try bone-in ribs and put my cooker on auto-shift to see if that helps.  Loved the sauce, I put it over white rice!

holy buckets! one of the few recipes I have scanned the reviews and decided to make as it without changing anything (and yes, I believe we should only rate the recipe as is not on a bazillion changes)! THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY DELISH. I shredded the ribs and served it over rice with some steamed broccoli. SO LOVELY! I even went to far as to make my own teriyaki sauce since I didn't want to run to the Asian store for that one ingredient. THANK YOU!!!

This recipe is WAY better if you brown the ribs in a pan before adding them to the slow cooker. Made them a few times with and without browning and there is definitely a difference.

Omg....so good!!! The meat just fell apart and melted in my mouth...i did use about a teaspoon full of the spices to rub on the meat and i found the liquid mixture just a little too salty for my taste...so i added some brown sugar and honey to the liquids ...i also cooked the meat on high for 3  1/2 hours and for the last 1 1/2 i turned it down to low....these were some of the best ribs ever...

I cooked ribs on 4th of July using this recipe (except I increased the serving to about 20 and had to use 2 slow cookers) and it was GREAT! Myself and everyone else really enjoyed them. Very flavorful and very tender (fall off the bone, my favorite kind of ribs!).

The only thing I did not like about it was there was a lot of grease. This could have been the ribs or could have been something I done wrong. I dunno, but it was still good. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I can't say I was impressed. It didn't taste like ribs, but more of an asian style food. I prefer more of a bbq taste on ribs. Also, the sauce was too thin in my opinion

We liked this. I liked the chili powder and Worcestershire sauce in it. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I didn't have teriyaki, so I left that out and used 1/2 cup pineapple juice in place of it and the OJ. I used garlic powder instead of salt to cut down on the saltiness. I finely chopped a small yellow onion and put that in too. At 8 hrs, the meat on the outer edges was getting a bit burnt and a little dry, so my crockpot only needs 6-7 hrs next time. I served mashed potatoes and used the sauce as gravy. Thanks for a great recipe I'll make again.

I followed the recipe as exact as possible, with the exception of the hot pepper sauce (I had none).  Based on other reviews, I used the measurement of 1 T for each of the dry ingredients (the rub).  For my steak seasoning, I used Mesquite flavor, which is what I had on hand.  My pork ribs came to 4.90 pounds total, and my crock pot is on the smaller side.  Also, some of my ribs had a few bones.  I cooked it on high power for the crock pot.  (I just now threw everything in and it is 11:45 late morning--I will come back to give a more accurate rating after we eat these and will be keeping an eye on how they cook throughout the day.  OK, at  4 o'clock the 6 ribs were done perfect and the house does indeed smell delicious.  I am turning the pot off in the hope that they will still be as delicious in the next hour and a half as they are right now.  The piece I ate tasted rather strongly like pepper.  Hmmm, maybe a little less pepper (like 1 tsp) would be better for my taste, but other than that, the sauce tastes just delicious.  Great recipe--thank you.

I made this a month ago and forgot to review -- they were absolutely delicious! Everyone loved them! My husband couldn't wait to take leftovers in his lunch. I will say that I eliminated the orange juice and Worcestershire sauce because I didn't have any, and it was still amazing! I plan on making this again tonight the exact same way since they were such a hit! PS -- I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.

My family loves this recipe for regular baby back ribs.  Great taste and the meat falls right off the bone.  I didn't use the exact measurements, but added all the ingredients.  I have 3 boys and this is the recipe of choice.

I have read several of the reviews for this recipe which I have made many times. The dry and wet ingredients are your own choosing, like just using your favorite BBQ sauce, or perhaps using a dry rub which includes the listed ingredients. My best tip is use fatty meat which will keep it moist, also try bone in ribs. Either way do yourself a favor and sear you rubbed meat first in a pan.

Made this 3 weekends ago (just found my "notes") This was my first time making ribs in the slow cooker and I absolutely loved this recipe.  The flavor was different than the same old BBQ style...unfortunately, my husband prefers the "same old".  I would recommend this recipe.

I just didn't care for these. The smell all day wasn't even a good one. Not sure what was off in the ingredients for me ... the OJ? Who knows, but something in it, just wasn't a good fit for me. The ribs were tender, though.

I would make it again, it came out very tender and there could be a large variation of taste based on what BBQ sauce you would use.  I did have to substitute tamari for the soy sauce (not much difference in flavor) and I had no OJ so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of orange zest, instead.

These come out soo good. I used about a table spoon of each of the dry rub, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. I added about 1/4 cup chopped onion and as a twist I spread a can of crushed pineapple  over the ribs, cooked on low setting   for 6 hours. just falling apart and so good. served with cheesy mashed potatoes.

My family loved it and I had fun telling them the ingredients! It got some funny reactions, especially the orange juice! But there were no complaints, only compliments when the house started to smell wonderful. 
The only thing I'd say is that I knew 8 hours even on low would be too much for boneless ribs, but I also understand that slow cookers vary. I set it for 5 hours and it was basically done in 4, so I turned it down to warm until we were ready to eat. Delicious over potatoes!

Ribs turned out good.  Sauce was too tangy, although I didn't have any terriyaki sauce, and that probably didn't help. Try adding terriyaki sauce or brown sugar next time.

The rub was terrible, and made everything else not-so-great. The only other thing I should add is to NOT overcook your ribs. The amount of time called for is perfect. But I won't be making this again.

I'm giving this 5 stars, though like other reviewers I increased the amount of dry rub dramatically.  I used a teaspoon of each seasoning and only had 3# ribs.  It was just enough to cover all the ribs just fine.  When my husband got home tonight, he said whatever I was making sure smelled good!  We sat down to eat and we both agreed it also tasted fantastic.

This was o.k., but I found it didn't have much flavour at all. I followed the recipe to a tee, but it was underwhelming. Meat tasted quite bland I thought.

Awesome recipe!  The ribs turned out tender with just the right bite to them for zest. This is a keeper.  Don’t forget to spray your  crock  for quick clean up.

My family loved them!  I only had 3 pounds of ribs, but I probably doubled the rub.  The flavor of the rub came through after cooking all day.  This will definitely be made again.

I did as another reviewer suggested and started with a Tablespoon on some of the ingredients. Since I don't have garlice salt on hand any longer I used 2 Tablespoons of Garlic Powder and 1 tsp of salt , 2 Tbl. of the Chili powder and the steak seasoning and 1 tsp of a fine black pepper. I acutally started off with half and when I was half way through I was out of rub so I made another batch and it was exactly enough. This is the best way to cook country style ribs I have ever tasted. Wonderful recipe. We grill baby backs on the grill and they are perfect but Country style ribs always seem to get dry and chewy. This was tender and juicy. Can't wait to eat it again. I wish there was a way to customize the recipe with the changes.

I used nature's seasoning on the ribs as well as salt and pepper and I cut out the chili powder and hot sauce (I can't handle the heat).  The final product was amazing and my fiance loved how the pork just falls apart!  The only thing that would make this recipe better is if the sauce came out thicker in the end.

Very tasty. I used Montreal Seasoning and didn't have teriyaki sauce. Replaced the orange with lemon for an acid. Really smelled great while cooking and 4 hours on high did the trick. Never would have added soy sauce and worcestershire sauces together with BBQ sauce but it worked beautifully. Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely make again.

These were good however I'm going to have to work on seasoning the meat to my taste. My husband and daughter loved them. I thought they  could use a little more flavor. The ribs were very tender but the sauce was not sticky like I like. Maybe reducing the liquids a bit would give the sauce a better consistency. This is a good and easy recipe, one you can adjust to your liking. Give it a try.

This is a very easy recipe to follow. I was disappointed about the outcome of the ribs. I felt that the sauce was a bit salty for my liking. Maybe you can add more BBQ sauce and leave out the Soya sauce or the teriyaki sauce, both as you know is very high in salt Won't make again. Ribs did turn out very tender .

I made this as written except I left out  that teriyaki sauce because I didn’t have any on hand. The seasoning and taste was great. The ribs, however, dried out. I will definitely make again but probably will not cook as long as the recipe calls for. I think it could be shortened a couple of hours or cooked on high For maybe 3 1/2 hours and the meat wouldn’t be as dry but the taste would still be great.

This came out perfect! I notoriously over-cook ribs and this was the first time they came out just right. I used a couple different seasonings based on what I had on hand. I left out the teriyaki sauce and put in extra orange juice. I also added some brown sugar to the mixture to give it a little sweetness. I marinated the ribs overnight in the sauce. It came out super delicious!!

My ribs were awesome fall off the bone amazing. Did not use the garlic as it wasn’t necessary. Cooked on low for 8 hours. My family absolutely loved it.  Will do it again soon. The sauce was light, little sweet and tangy. We use it as dipping sauce it was just that good!!!

These were so good and tender. Not dry. I did not have terriyaki instead used some stir fry sauce. Did not use hot sause. Cooked in slow cooker on low for 8 hours. I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Next time I might marinate for a few hours.

Great recipe! My family loved the ribs, very flavorful. As someone else mentioned, I too had to add ALOT more dry seasonings. I used at least 2 tablespoons of each, I had a 5 pound package of ribs. Will definitely be using this recipe for my ribs going forward!

I made this! Used four boneless country style pork ribs and paired with steakhouse style green beans and Cracker Barrel macaroni and cheese for the hubby and I!

This was delicious! I modified slightly and made it in my Dutch oven. I had no teriyaki or garlic salt. I used garlic, a touch of honey, and liquid smoke instead. I headed the advice of others and seared the meat before cooking. To coat the ribs I mixed them in a mixing bowl. I believe I used 4 teaspoons of each dry ingredient. They cooked in the oven at 325 for roughly 3 hours.

It was okay, but nothing special.  I agree with several others that it didn't really make enough  seasoning rub.  The meat was tender, but the sauce was too thin with a very mediocre flavor.

They were good but I added extra spices like garlic powder and some BBQ seasoning. I used honey BBQ on them, but I will probably try out different BBQ sauces next time.

These ribs were easy to do.  I put in 6 ribs together, I think if I separated them and before serving just stuck under  broil for a few minutes in the oven to get a little crispy it would have been better.  Will do again, real easy,tasty and ingredients I usually have in the house.

I made these last night ( I had about 3.25lbs) and they were very good. I ditched the BBQ sauce and added a bit more rub (kids do not like BBQ sauce)
A bit over 8 hours in the slow cooker and put these over a bed of white rice... yummy!

These ribs were a big hit with my family. I only made a few changes. I increased the amount of rub to about 1 teaspoon of each spice, and added 1 tsp of picante smoked paprika. We like spicy dishes. Will definitely make this again.

Whoever invented slow cooker liners is my hero!.  The only downside to the recipe was a pinch of this and a pinch of that. I work better with clear detailed directions.  You really cant test it for taste so keep your fingers crossed you got just the right amount of pinches.

loved it!! i added a bit more than a pinch of seasoning, that's just me. The ribs did seem a bit over cooked, I slowed cooked just as the recipe stated. low for 8 hours. So the ribs were a lil bit over cooked, but the recipe was delicious.

This recipe was amazing just the way it was!! I did just pour about a teaspoon of each spice to make rub just so I had enough but other than that I followed exact. I cooked it on low for about 7 hours. So wet and they just fell apart. A ton of juice left in crock pot to put on it if you want. Will be making this many more times!!

The cooking time is way too long for these. I used country-style ribs (the big, meaty kind), pulled 'em out after 4.5 hours and they were already a bit dry. Keep a close eye if you decide to make this. This dish had a unique flavor but it's not something I'd make again. I think my taste buds became overwhelmed by all the flavors or something. I dunno. Thank you for sharing.

I did not have any orange juice, but it was still great.  I made it for my significant other and his family.  Everyone liked it, even my S/O, who is not a fan of most things that come from a crock pot.   It was very easy and quick to prep too, which is always a plus!

Based on other reviews, I used the dry rub and braised in a hot skillet before putting these in the slow cooker. Cooked on low for 6 hours, rearranging them twice. Excellent. Shredded the leftovers for sandwiches another night.

It will definitely go into our slow cooker rotation as it was quick and easy.  It does require more than a pinch of seasoning  for the dry rub.  I will also reduce the bbq sauce next time and add a bit more teriyaki.

I've made this before with Sunny D and it turned out great! Tonight I'm making it with 100% real orange juice and I'm sure it'll turn out just as great.  I also don't measure my seasonings or liquids because I always make more than what the recipe calls for. These come out super moist and SO good! They just fall apart.....

Although I really enjoyed it and I will make it again 2 of us liked it and another person. Stated that they did not really care for the sauce but really liked the rub.

Followed this recipe as is except for the seasoning which I increased. It is wonderful! The sauce is great over brown rice!

After reading the reviews, I decided to reduce the salt by using a no -salt  steak spice and low sodium soya and teriyaki.  But, the sauce was still so unbearably salty that it was almost inedible. I admit that I also used a low calorie Barbeque sauce (by Kraft) which was horrible. Overall, the recipe was a bust.

Delicious! Recipe variation: I did not use Teriyaki nor OJ. Instead I used 1/4 c. Apple Cider Juice without added sugars AND garlic flavored red wine vinegary--probably less than 1/4 cup. I also did not add hot sauce so I can let my 2 year old and 1 year old try the meat. Enjoy!

Made this in the past, but not with all listed ingredients. I like to "play" with a recipe most of the time! I can say that this type of pork rib turns out GREAT in the crock pot

This is the second time around for this one. Winged it this time as far as spices and such this time. Without a doubt a crowed pleaser. Moistus (yes I made that word up)ribs you will ever taste! Thank you Caselicious.

I've made this a few times now. My family loves it. I need more of the rub than is listed in the ingredients, and I've substituted pineapple juice for the orange juice because I ran out. Pineapple juice works great in the recipe. I serve it over rice.

These are delicious! My kids loved them too. I will try this with a roast too. It was a little salty, so I'll probably just use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also worried about it being too spicy for my kids, but it was mild. They didn't complain at all which is saying something. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I followed this recipe except for the Orange juice; I had none so I added Hoisin sauce and we LOVE THEM!! Until summer comes back to Indiana and we can grill again, this is how we'll enjoy ribs. 
Thanks for sharing!

We made this and it is great. Had to use a lot mor of the rub then what is listed , bit that wasn't a big deal. It makes your house smell wonderful and tastes just as good. We will make this again.

Sauce was a little salty. Don't know if it would have helped but I didn't have any Worcestershire. Next time I will probably make it without the soy sauce and add a little more OJ.

I changed the recipe somewhat as I did not have any orange juice and added paprika to the rub.  I cooked for 3 hours on high as we live at sea level.  The ribs were delicious and very tender.  Would certainly use this one again.

It was okay. Can't walk away from this one. I cooked them while i was at work and they tops of the ribs where a little brown. If I would have been home to watch them, I could have made sure they were turned or basted every once in a while. The meat still fell off the bone and the flavor was good in spite of the issue.

Disappointed.  The smell cooking all day was wonderful.  But the end product was much less tasteful; it was salty and dry.  It was tender but the fat on the ribs was jello-like.

Tastes great, I didnt leave it on low for 8 hours out of fear of it drying out like I read in other reviews. after 4 hours the pork was clearly cooked I turned it down to warm. My only complaint is the sauce is very thin, runny, not thick and gooey like the photo.....oh well.

Whole family loved it! Used 1 tsp of each of the dry ingredients and it was just enough for my 3.5 pounds of ribs. Sauce in the slow cooker was super yummy over white rice.

Slow cooked pork is always good, but this sauce was way too salty. I suggest leave out the soy sauce and tariyaki; perhaps substitute homemade chicken broth, but not commercial sauce which is also too salty.

Not bad but not great.  Slow cooked for 8 hous and the meat was very tender.  The sauce tasted a bit tangy/vinegary for me.  Maybe it was my bbq sauce.

Even using lower sodium soy sauce and diluting it with water we found this recipe to be too salty.  Would definitely not make again.  Sadly disappointed.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  The meat itself did not have a whole lot of flavor.  Will find a new recipe for pork ribs.
