Ahhh - soft & savory, not too eggy & very tasty. I made these in individual ramekins and served them just warm they were perfect. Thank you. UPDATE - I used 4" ramekins and baked for just about 20 minutes.

MMM!  So good!  My husband raved about it!  I didn't have any nutmeg or sherry, so I improvised a bit:  I substituted the nutmeg for a high-quality cinnamon (Penzey's), and added just a pinch of cayenne pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce.  Also, I didn't have enough of one kind of cheese to cover the whole thing, so I used a combo of white and regular cheddar.  It was FABULOUS!  I think the tiny bit of heat in the background adds a lot.  I think it would be even better with a firmer bread, though.  Great twist on bread pudding!  :)

My husband LOVES bread pudding so I had to give this recipe a try.  We both liked it and I will definitely make it again!

I decided to try this recipe for a quick Saturday night dinner. The recipe was easy and, best of all, the ingredients were mostly available in my pantry.  Because I didn't have bacon, I sliced up and saut√©ed 3 small onions, because we love onions & they're good for you. I also used multigrain bread but omitted the buttering because we don't need extra fat. Still, the dish turned out very well and was delicious. A note about the sherry...  It would be a shame to leave it out. It imparts a lovely flavour to the dish. It's reason enough to keep a bottle of sherry on hand!  Thanks for this marvellous dinner idea. Bread pudding isn't just dessert!

Rather than discarding the crusts, I cut them up and added them in.   Didn't use Sherry as I didn't have any, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Cooked it in a square 9 inch pan, rather than a pie plate.

Definitely soft and savoury, a nice mild breakfast dish.  Will make it again but try to kick it up another notch.  Needs some salt and pepper in the eggy mixture, maybe some hot sauce.  I'll also probably use less cheese as the amount stated here felt like waaay too much just as a topping!

I don't know whether it is my oven or not but 20 minutes wasn't enough time. It was soggy in the middle so I put it back in for 10 more minutes. I didn't use the sherry at all so I think it might have been even more soggy with the extra liquid. Other than that it was pretty darn tasty.I love bacon and onion so next time I will use even more of those!

My husband made a worried face when I told him I was making bread pudding, as he is not a fan. I told him not to fret, this would be delicious. Thanks for making me look like a star at the dinner table. This was AWESOME! We would give it 10 stars if we could.

I halved the recipe and used ramekins like another reviewer. I didn't have worcester but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I had to bake it 25 minutes, and even then it fell a little after sitting out. I wasn't all that impressed. It was good but not worth making again.
