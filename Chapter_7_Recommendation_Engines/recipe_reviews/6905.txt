Wow!  These came out great... fluffy and not-too-sweet.  HEADS UP--I needed to add about 1/4 cup less milk, or more flour, to given them a real scone-ish consistency.  So quick and easy. I would recommend putting some spice into the batter, though, to liven them up... a cinnamon/ nutmeg/allspice combo worked great for me!

These scones are wonderful.  I added cinnamon to the dough as many of you have.  Instead of apples I used peaches and it turned out just delicious.  I will definitely make these again.

These are pretty good.  If you want them to bake up a little better use 2 cups of self-rising flour vs. all purpose, 1/4 c. of sugar, 1/2 tsp. of baking powder, 1 tsp. of cream of tartar, and 1/4 tsp. of salt.  Freeze the butter and grate it on a cheese grater.  I added 1/4 tsp. of nutgeg and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and vanilla.  I always use half and half instead of milk. I used a red delicious apple and added 1/4 c. of raisins.  These came out nice, but next time I might add two apples for more apple taste.

I was hoping for the type of scone you find in coffee shops.  The only reason why this fell short is because it has more of a cakey consistency.  The apple was mild and it was not too sweet.  Good warm with a little butter spread on top.  Not hard to make!

I don't know what went wrong.  I used a tasty granny smith apple, and added apple pie spice to the dough, but there was just no flavor.  I won't be making these again.  Bummer.

Fantastic, I love these scones well done. I had to make a second batch, they were eaten up almost as soon as they came out of the oven. I added some rasisns to the second batch very good......

These were ok.  The apple taste did not stand out so well, and the apple I got was ripe.  Perhaps I should have purchased a Granny Smith rather than a Fugi.  I would make again as it isquick and good with some butter and jelly.

Amazing scones. This is my first attempt at making them.

I ended up changing the recipe a bit: doubling the sugar, adding 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, as Kristiegreen suggested. Also, I added 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup more flour than the recipe call for, as the dough came out really sticky. However, they came out tasting sweet and rich and I'd make them again in a second!

I'll add more than 1/4 cup sugar. It's tasteless, and I couldn't taste or smell the apple at all. Was disappointing.

Yummy recipe! I took the advice of some others and added spices b/c I think it would otherwise be bland. (I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg and 1/8 tsp. cloves) I also wanted them to be somewhat sweeter than the average scone. --I'm not a fan of blah food.-- ;) So, I added about 2 tbsp extra brown sugar to the mix and a little extra white sugar. The result was perfect!! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Love it, and will definitely make again!!!

I added some chopped pecans to the dough and baked them on a stoneware piece. They came out just perfect.  I also made some cinammon honey butter to spread on them right out of the oven.  Yummy!  Will be making more soon....

In a word, YUM!  DH, who is not a fruit or scone person, really loved this.  The kids and I enjoyed with lemon curd.  I was sorry I made only a half-batch! 

Note for the lazy or cooking impaired:  I use the drop method for forming my scones--I do minimal kneading in the bowl just to  get everything incorporated and plop serving spoon sized mounds of dough on a silpat lined baking sheet.  EASY and FABULICIOUS!!!

The dough seemed a bit wet to start with, but added a little extra flour while kneading. Definitely make sure your hands are well dusted before starting. Came out fantastic, other than the stickiness at first, didn't have any of the problems mentioned in other reviews. Taste was nice, light and perfect with strawberry butter (about 1/2 softened butter mixed with 1/2 seedless strawberry jam). Yummm.
 
Aha!! Made them again this morning and figured out that by doing it all in my cuisine art, it breaks the apples down more, and makes the dough much wetter. Definitely need to use a tad less milk and only add enough to get to that soft dough stage and not go beyond it to the sticky mess stage.  The recipe got rave reviews from DDs 2nd grade class.

We loved these! Added two macintosh apples, and 1/2 c sugar because my family likes their scones a little sweeter and flavorful. Would definitely make again! Very simple, easy, and quick!

Excellent recipe! These were just the right consistency and texture. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the butter/flour mixture to add a little extra flavor. A definite keeper!

I found this recipe and after reading some of the reviews I added cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice to the batter.  I also added about 1/4 tsp of vanilla and two apples.  These came out very moist and tasty.

This was a very easy and fun recipe to make.  It came out looking gorgeous and was delicious.  We used brown sugar instead of white and added a teaspoon of cinnamon plus about half a teaspoon of ground allspice to the dough mix.  Good as it was, it still seems like it is "missing something" -- so we may continue to tinker.  But I know we will make it again soon.

These scones are awesome.  The only modification that I made was to make 
dough into one circle before scoring it into wedges instead of two circles.
Having six larger scones seemed to work better for me.  An awesome recipe,
though!  I have made it several times and every time it turns out perfectly.
Thank you for submitting this one!

Not bad, but I would reduce the amount of baking soda. You can taste it, I will try this recipe again with less baking soda.

These scones turned out perfect, not too dense, not too fluffy.  Because the dough was sticky, I skipped the kneading and just dropped the scones by spoonfuls onto a baking sheet.  They turned out fine.

This recipe lacked taste.  I added extra apple as suggested but it needs something else.  Easy recipe if you are a first timer at scones.

i absolutely loved this recipe.  i just made it tonight and it was super fast and ez.  i don't have a grater so i sliced the apple in thin slices.  my dough was also very sticky so i didnt even try to knead it.  i baked it for 37 minutes because it looked like it was becoming too brown. i sifted all the sugar/cinnamon mixture on top of the 2 scones prior to baking and the result was a sweet crunchy top.  not dry and crumbly like other scones!  try it!

I followed some other reviewers' advice and added a second apple, plus 1/2 tsp cinnamon mixed in with the batter along with 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also used Splenda in place of sugar, whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose, and margarine in place of butter and had no issues. I then sprinkled the top of the 6" circle with a tablespoon of splenda and additional cinnamon, and cut it into 8 scones.
I think I might swap some of the flour for oats next time, just to shake things up, but they're still delicious without that particular extra touch. 
Also, I was in a bit of a fluster when I was making these (long and unrelated story) and added the liquids before I realized I had not yet cut in the margarine. So I cut it in as I simultaneously mixed in the liquids, just moistening the dry. No problems came of my err. A nice, simple recipe, and my kitchen smells so wonderful!

Good recipe...Beginning with the time I placed the plate on the table, 1 and 1/2 batches were gone in 30 minutes!! I added about 1/8th cup more sugar and used a granny smith apple.  Next time I'll be cubing the apple instead of shredding and adding a bit of vanilla since the apple was a little lost in the dough.

I followed others advice and only added 1/4 cup of milk and added cinnamon and nutmeg to dough. I also topped with finely chopped crystallized ginger. These turned out great!

Ok, just a little tip...  freeze the butter well, then grate it into the dry ingredients, then mix well...  it's easier than cutting it in, and incorporates it easier into the mix.  This step takes little effort and maximum results, it's how I always "cut-in" butter to a recipe...  Oh yeah, I usually mix it into the dry ingredients by hand,  mush it and mix it till combined....

Delicious!  My family of 4 (including 2 under age 4) had no problem finishing the whole batch for breakfast!  I made a couple of minor changes...including using half whole wheat flour and adding a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  I used the whole 1/2 cup of milk and the dough was not too sticky as some said.  It was perfect.  
At the last minute, I decided to whip up a little glaze of powdered sugar, apple juice, and cinnamon to drizzle on top.  That made them extra special.  I'll be making these again, tomorrow actually, and many more times for sure!

I tried to make scones once before and they ended up burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. So anyway I'm trying to give it another go this time kneeding it less. I swapped a couple of things...I added in raisans, took out the apple, used ghee instead of butter cause we were out and also used a tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/2 and also added in 1/2 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I coated it with just milk and white sugar. I also didn't have any bi-carb soda so I used 3 tsp of baking powder. I really regret using the ghee as I don't think it's usually used in baking and gives a strong smell that I quite dislike when it's cooking-I have gotten a headache. I doubt anyone would sub it in instead of butter-but just a warning. DON'T! I'm still giving this recipe 4 stars just because I didn't follow it exactly and if I had butter I'm sure that there might have been a better result. It did brown nicely though although inside wouldnt very scone-like..you might need more flour.
Oh and ghee is purified butter.

This is my first try at making scones and I want to say they turned out perfect.  I had some apples that were on thier last day and wanted to make something with them. This recepie was easy to follow and I made the scones into pizza shapes.  I put a glaze topping  on after they baked I made with powdered surgar, milk, and butter on top. It was supurbly delicious.  I am going back for seconds now!

The dough was so sticky I don't know how you can possibly knead it so I added more flour. My family did not really like these, although they were edible. I would not make them again.

i found the dough a bit too mushy to shape, maybe because i poured the juice from the grated apple in, but it turned out very tasty. the only problem was that the bottom was burnt.

One of my favourites.  I've been making this one for about six months now, and it's always a hit. My English grandmother thought they were wonderful.  Moist, not too sweet, and delicious with Devonshire cream and a bit of raspberry jam!

After reading the other reviews I have to agree that the batter needed extra moisture.  I made half a batch and used one apple roughly chopped to the batter.  I also added a little cinnamon and additional milk  to the batter just until the mixture held together.  For my personal tastes, I would have preferred the scone to be a little sweeter but it was still very good for our morning coffee.

I love this recipe. I made them for my Hebrew class and they were gone so fast ! The only problem that I had was the bottoms seem to burn. Any tips on that? Also, I used applesauce and mixed cinnamon in the dough, and it turned out real well that way.

The recipe was easy enough but once baked I found they lacked in flavor.  I doubt that anyone would be able to guess they were Apple and I did use fresh apples.  Not really a traditional scone either, reminded me more of a cross between a biscuit and muffin?

Eh, just so-so.  I didn't have much luck with these.  The dough was mush so it wasn't easy to knead without sticking to everything.  I added extra apple and cinnamon after reading other reviews and I still thought these were bland.  Not awful, just not something I'd make again.

These are the first scones I have ever made. They were very easy to make. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg into the batter. I also made them into rolls rather then wedges and then rolled them in cinnamon and sugar. They tasted great with some clotted cream.

A delicious tasting scone! I modified the recipe a little, using 1 cup of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and an extra apple. (Still lacked the apple flavor though. Perhaps substituting applesauce in stead of milk would enhance the apple flavour?)
Once my dry ingredients were all mixed together and I had added my apples, I mixed the apples and the dry ingredients together to get a better idea of how much milk I would need to put in. I used 1/4 cup of milk then mixed again then only added half of 1/4 cup. That was plenty. After mixing some more I realized that just 1/4 cup of milk would have been enough but they turned out having the right consistency. I made 10 individual scones and baked them according to the recipes time. Will be making these again.

Although the end results tasted good, getting there was quiet sad. I added an extra apple, vanilla, nutmeg, and cinn. to the batter, I mean dough. The dough was very moist and sticky. I decided to not add any extra flour like most suggested and use the cake-like batter. They turned out good in the end!

This is a pretty good recipe, although a few changese were necessary to perfect it. The dough was much too wet so I had to add more flour, almost another full cup (I made a scaled down version - 4 servings). Also, it's probably because of my oven, but I probably should have left it for 20-23 minutes because it still came out a bit doughy.

I also added in vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the dough. Oh, and extra apples are a plus, since there wasn't too much apple taste to it.

These came out very thin like some reviewers had said.  They also made a mess of my oven.  However, they turned out to be delicious.

these are VERY yum.  i cut the recipe in half, since you know... well, my parents probably would eat them all, but i am not willing to contribute to their fatness (which will probably never happen-- down with skinny people!), i make these with a breakfast casserole i make and a tossed salad for dinner... i've made them with apples, and frozen raspberries, which break quite nicely into cute little raspberry beads, so they integrate well.  i think the liquid is a little much, i just add enough for it to stick together in a biscuit like dough, and don't bother with kneading it on the countertop.  overall, they're excellent.

Very nice scones.  I used 2 apples and added some cinnamon to the dry ingredients, and I actually grated the butter in and then used the same grater for the apples. For a sweet touch, I drizzled icing over the tops.  Son loved them!

These scones are wonderful. Easy to prepare and guaranteed to work. I did exchange the white sugar for golden brown sugar. The apple I used was a large Braeburn, which I grated coarsely. Also, I added one teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough. The 15 min. baking time were not enough so I encreased it to 25 min. Thank you Carol, for posting this recipe. It was this morning's successful breakfast. Even our 2-year old liked it and she is a very fussy eater.

The scones were really good!  They were kind of too gooey on the inside, I don't think I should have added as much milk as I did.  Knead before deciding to add anything more--that's where I messed up.

These scones are great.  I made them for my visiting family, and they raved.  The second time I made them, I added several dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, and they were even better.  So easy too!  An immediate keeper.

These were good, but not particularly healthy. I substituted fruit puree for the butter, used twice the amount of apple, and threw in a cup of whole wheat flour- the recipe needed that to really have a scone texture anyway. It comes out a bit better for you.

These have a great taste - we loved them.  But I did have to use probably 1/3 cup more flour so I could knead them like it says.  Without this extra flour the dough was just like muffin batter - way to sticky to knead.  This time I made them I didn't add the extra flour - I just kind of kneaded then with the spoon in the bowl and mounded it on the cookie sheet.  They are still in the over - We'll see if they turn out any different.  Regardless, I will continue making these.  It's great to find a scone recipe without a huge amount of butter or cream.  Thanks for posting it!

These are excellent, not too sweet scones. Usually, they're loaded with butter/sugar or both - but not these scones!!!I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and 3 tbsp of flax seeds for some fiber. Serve by themselves or with scrambled eggs and sliced cheese, and you have a hearty breakfast!!!:)

I followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious. More cake like than I was hoping for but still very good. I think next time I will add a bit more apple (2 small granny smith's) and a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients for a touch more flavor. Or might even try 1/8th cinnamon & 1/8 cloves.

Great recipe, but I made a few changes. A few reviews said the apple flavor gets lost, so i did a fine dice rather than shred. I also added a splash of Jameson irish whiskey for flavor... you could probably do vanilla or almond extract. I also mixed the cinnamon and sugar together before sprinkling it over the scones. These are really simple, and the flavoring is suttle, but these are really great, especially with a good-sized dab of butter on them right after they come out of the oven :) Cheers, and happy eating!

These were great.  I did chop my apple and added dried cranberries, I also had to add an additional 1/4 milk because the mixture was way too dry to even bind together.  These looked just like scones that came from  a local bakery.  My family loved them and my kids really enjoyed helping make them.

These turned out great!  I used a gala apple.  I added cinnamon to the dough. For all the people who said it was not sweet enough try adding extra sugar to the top of the scones before baking.  I will definatly make these again and will try adding new things to this recipe.

Overall, not bad. I added spices, and fresh it was ok. But, for me, the baking soda taste was too much. I am very careful with measurements, but I couldn't stand the taste of baking soda in these. After they were cool, it was even stronger.

It was tough to rate this recipe.  I gave it 3 stars because I felt that it could have been a little sweeter, and the apple taste didn't really come through.  But I wanted to give more stars because it was super easy to make. Like other people I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  Next time I will double the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg and maybe add some more sugar.  With a little work, this could be an awesome recipe.

So good!  Added just a little more sugar and used a Granny Smith apple.  I used less than 1/2c milk, just enough to make it stick together.  Dough was sticky but workable.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  These scones were divine.

These were excellent and not too sweet.  I added about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice directly to the dough as well.  I didn't have any milk and used cream instead, which was marvelous.  The dough at first was very, very dry and almost impossible to incorporate all of flour, so I added about 1 Tbsp. plain yogurt to make it a little smoother.  I would recommend baking them 11-12 minutes instead of the full 15 to keep them from being crunchy.

These scones are so moist and were the favorite at a gathering where everyone brought their own scones to share.  I loved the cinnamon sugar topping and the bits of apple inside.  This is a recipe I'll keep to make over and over.

So easy; so good. And they reheat well -- just give a couple of wedges 30 seconds in the microwave. You need a big apple, though. If your apples are small, use two of them

They were yummy, but were not as scone-like as they should have been. Far too doughy.

Excellent!  Excellent!  Excellent!  Easy to make, very tasty.  My son loved it!  I however used 1/2 of sugar, leftover Gerber apple sauce and no milk.   I also did not use any sugar or cinnamon for topping (I added cinnamon into the dough), but came out very good.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked that this didn't use eggs and seems much healthier than a standard scone recipe with only 1/4 cup of butter and regular milk. I subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in addition to 1.5 cups of white flour and my apple seemed small so i used about one and a half apples.
unlike other reviewers my dough came out very wet and i just kneaded it in the bowl and dropped blobs onto a cookie sheet.

These tasted great. I  mixed everything up in my standing mixer, which made it such that I didn't have to knead the dough. I formed 2 blobs of dough on my cookie sheet & then spread the milk & sugar on. Once I did that, I found it was easier to mold the dough & spread it out some. It wasn't as sticky once the milk was on it.

mmmm... These are yummy. Perfect scone consistency. I added a little extra sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the batter. I also diced the apple instead of shredding. Defintely will make again!

These turned out great, and I will make them again. Some reviewers said the dough was sticky so they added more flour, I did not. I just dealt with the stickyness and washed my hands. They baked up beautifully.

I made these this morning for breakfast, they were very tastey. I used 3/4 Whole Wheat flour, 1/4c oat flour and 1 c white flour.  I also used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 marg. I lightly coated my grated apples with cinnamon.  I also substitued 1/2 the sugar with splenda.  Even my husband enjoyed.  Thanks for posting this recipe

Great recipe - turns out delicious and they become even more "scone-like" as they sit (at first they are a bit bready).  I will make these again - as a note, I had to add quite a bit more flour (at least another 1/2 cup) to make this into a workable dough (still very pliable); otherwise it was more like a batter.  I will chalk this up to high humidity and the fact that I used reduced fat butter, though - not a fault of the recipe (I almost always have to add more flour to recipes).

We loved this!  I added cinnamon to the batter.  I forgot to put the cinnamon and sugar mixture on the top before cooking, so I spread butter on the top of the scones after taking them out of the over and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top.  I will always make them these way.  The butter gave the scones more flavor.  Thanks!  We will make again!

I added some cinnamon to the dough, which helped with the flavor.  I think I might add some more apple next time, and maybe a little more salt.

These scones are my favorite!!  I always make them for guests, and they think that I went to tons of trouble.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.  Instead of making two big scones, I always make 12 individual ones.  And I never knead the dough.  I just scoop it out of the bowl onto my pan.  Unlike some other reviewers, I wouldn't change anything about the ingredients of this recipe.  I think they're perfect.  It's just a very light flavor, just perfect for breakfast.

I agree with others that this recipe is just missing something.  Even with adding cinnamon and more apple to the batter, it just doesn't 'wow' you.  I  probably will not make these again..sorry.

I was a bit disappointed with these scones.  The dough was very crumbly and needed too much handling to get it to stick together.  Forget about kneading.  The baked scones were not light and flaky, probably from the excessive stirring, and you couldn't taste the apple (I used Granny Smiths).  I added about 1/3 cup crystallized ginger which did improve the flavour.  I'll try this recipe once more (I hate to give up on something on the first attempt) but will add a bit more milk to the dry ingredients which will hopefully cut down on the stirring.

Tasty - I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter, but they turned out more like apple biscuits than scones as the texture wasn't consistent with traditional scones.

I brought these to a school tea and they got great reviews from first graders, teachers, and parent.  My family, bread lovers, loved them and they take no time at all to make.  They are so easy my kids make them on their own for breakfast and snacks.

Absolutely scrummy...Very tender, and not dry like some other scones I have made in the past. Has just the right touch of sweetness--not too sweet, but not bland. However, my dough mixture was a little too sticky/moist, so I added some extra flour to get the right consistency. Works wonderfully with biscuit cutters. (I used 3" biccy cutters after rolling out the dough.) Not a "complex" taste, but my little ones enjoyed them. :)

I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup flour.  I also use 1 and a half apple chopped.  My battle was a little runny, so I dropped the battle by teaspoon on baking sheet.  The smell was so good while I was baking.  Very delicous and moist.  I will deffinitely be making this again.

I thought these were VERY good. Anyone making these needs to keep in mind that scones are not generally very sweet or moist. It's not a cake type thing.

I love scones, but found this recipe pretty tasteless.... I'll try more apple and less milk next time.

Very easy recipe! They came out very moist and not dry and crumbly like some scone recipes I have tried. This recipe did not need any changes:)

This scone has no flavor.  The consistency is that of a biscuit more than a scone .  Very disappointing!

Delicious.  I used some flax meal and almond flour to replace just under half of the flour and used some splenda in place of the sugar and it was still delicious!  Per previous suggestion, added cinnamon to batter and just a touch of almond extract.  Yum!

I made this recipe with a Mac apple. Came out quite dry, even though I added a bit more milk. Very tasty though.

Very good. Used honey in place of sugar and added extra grated Granny Smith apples. Added 1 t. cinnamon to the dry mix. Also  added raisins which made this more sweet and tasty.  (And I don't usually like raisins in my baking but my husband loves raisin apple combinations). I used cream instead of milk. Skipped the butter / cinnamon on top just cut cold frozen butter and added to mix with cinnamon. We will be making these again.   Needed 5 extra minutes to bake than directions perhaps since I added extra grated apple. Very moist recipe and not overly sweet.

These were not to our liking but that does not mean they were bad. They were just a bit too dry and bland for our tastes. I will try them again and add an extra apple - the apple flavor did not come through at all. I will also try adding some spices to the mix - maybe cinnamon, nutmeg & ginger. Raisins might be a nice addition also. Even though they weren't our favorites they do go well with a cup of coffee or tea.

I made these tonight, and it was quick and easy, and tasted not too bad. The kids ate it :) I would have loved it to be sweeter with a more apple flavour, but Im sure that will come with practice. the dough was too soft to knead, so I scooped a large table spoon portion and pressed it slightly. It came out perfect in our opinion (good luck to me trying to replicate it twice) But If you try it once and it doesnt come out right...try, try again :) Its a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These came out amazing! I followed the advice of one reviewer and used 1/4 cup buttermilk, instead of the 1/2 cup milk called for. I also added a dash of ginger, zested half a small frozen lemon peel, and substituted a barely ripe peach for the apple. They were just a bit fluffier than I would have liked--more of a coffee cake than a scone--but still delicious with homemade clotted cream on top!

After reading the reviews, I stayed with the recipe on the wet/dry ingredients.  Added two small chopped gala apples, and cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.

The first batch didn't seem to be cooked all the way through; second batch I used the combo setting of convection/microwave and it turned out better.

I think what's really missing here from the flavor is the butter... 

I think the better scone recipe to use for a base is this one:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cranberry-scones-2/detail.aspx

Just change out the cranberries for apples and cinnamon.

I used splenda instead of sugar in both recipes and it worked fine.

Although my husband like these scones I probably won't use this recipe again.  The other recipe is so much richer and the texture was perfect.

This recipe was the easiest scone recipe that I have ever used.  The scones came out fluffy and absolutely the right sweetness.  I served them with our afternoon meal of hot soup and salad and they were a big hit with my husband.  It is number one on my guest menu.  Have made the scones several times and they are always a success.  I did not change any ingredients in the recipe but if you like it sweeter, by all means add more sugar.

Easy to make and good but the consistency is not truly scone-like; to me they were more muffiny.  Be careful when adding the milk; add it by the teaspoon so that it doesn't get too wet; the flour/butter mixture gets plenty wet when the apples are added so you might not need to add much of the milk.

Super recipe. I tweeked it a little. After reading a sweet roll recipe where the baker added apple brandy, it gave me the idea of putting something similiar in this recipe. I added a a tbl of apple crisp liqueur. Then, once it was done baking, I immediatly spritzed some more on top. This made the sugar crisp up. Not sure if this added to the recipe but you could taste the apples.

Delicious! I used a Braeburn apple, but golden delicious would be nice. I also added cinnamon to the batter instead of on top. The apple flavor is mild enough to truly be a scone vs a sugary dessert.

These got a little drier than I was expecting, and 15 minutes was a little too long to cook them---they were done in 10 and slightly burnt at 15.  Of the three types of scones I brought to the garden party, these got the lowest overall rating by fellow partygoers.

Simple, Quick, Not too sweet.  Only thing is the milk amount.  It caused a problem forming the dough for me.  So after looking at a review, I added more flour and I just don't know how much and wished for the best.   Thanks to another review, I wan to try this recipe with 1/4 milk instead of 1/2 cup. Overall, good.

Very good, I made mine in the food processor and it was super easy.  I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and I had two small apple.  I added a simple glaze when they cooled a bit instead of the cinnamon and suger.  My husband had never had scones before and he is very picky and he loved them.

I made these scones with a few adjustments. I added 3/4 cup chpped pecans and 1/2 cup golden raisens to the batter. The dough was quite dry so I added 1/2  apple and another tablespoon of milk. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamom to the dough. These were wonderful! The aroma was enough to bring my husband in the shop. Will make these many times.  Grandma Gin

We liked this recipe a lot and it was quick and easy to make.  I am going to experiment with different types of apple to enhance the apple flavor.  I used gala today and the apple was very mild.  I think my family will be asking for these again in the future.

As others stated, they were a little bland and I couldn't taste the apple at all. Had to add a little more flour to get a stiff enough dough to knead.  Next time I will mix the apples with cinnamon & sugar and maybe a little nutmeg to add some flavor.

I really enjoyed these! I would rather use apple pie filling or chunks of apple rather than having it shredded. I also added more sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter for extra taste and sweetness. This is a easy recipe and great for fast breakfast or a on the go snack.

Good base for scones: but adding 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the batter, and upping the sugar will produce a better tasting scone in this recipe. Otherwise, good!

This was nice, but a little bland even though I added extra cinnamon.  It made a nice textured scone and was a nice change for the norm.

These are wonderful!  Per others suggestions, I did sprinkle in a little cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, but otherwise follow the recipe as written.  Yummy!  My family and I thought they tasted like apple fritters only without the guilt of being deep fried.  We're adding this to our favorites!  Thanks for a tasty treat!

We had this for desert tonight.  Just right - not too sweet.  My husband & 3 year old both liked it.  I did have to add a little milk to the dough prior to kneading - it was too dry to hold together.  I will make this again.

I have never made scones, but this recipe was very simple and easy to make. The scones were very light and fluffy, but could use more apple i think. Overall nice low calorie recipe!

YUM! My son went to the pumpkin patch for a field trip and they got to pick apples so this is what we used them for. They where delicious! the only thing I changed  was that I drizzeled them with a simple  glaze. My son was so happy that his apples where so yummy!

The end result was good. I just had a hard time with the dough it was way too sticking even after adding more flour. Plus I didn't get any apple flavor. I doubt I would make again.

These were pretty darn good...but they had a problem: no flavor. I covered the scones in Cinnamon and Sugar, as i really love cinnamon.But even with that it was not to flavorful.It needs more to it. The only change I made was using heavy cream instead of milk, because i was out.
Update 3/25/17:
I made these again because I apparently forgot I'd made them before. I tried adding cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon to the dough as well again on top before baking. Still not very flavorful. 
I think the main issue that there needs to be more sugar in the recipe. Maybe if I forget I've made these the next time around, I will think to add more sugar as well.

Followed the recipe exactly except I also added a hint of cinnamon & nutmeg to the dough.  I used a large granny smith apple and added the exact amount of milk in the recipe but it came out dry and not sweet enough for my taste.  Will try again with maybe more milk or (like my favorite scone recipe suggests) a spoon of sour cream.  Used frozen butter and shredded it in my Cuisinart, then used the dough blade to assemble the dough.

There was a mixed reaction to these scones. 3 of us felt that although they were a nice scone the apple flavour didn't really come through with using just the one apple. My oldest daughter however who is not a scone lover really liked these. So I might make these again for her but use 2 apples. Thankyou.

I thought these were ok. The taste was very tasteless and the apples didn't come through. Also it needed much more milk than it said, i put about a cup of milk more.

I found the dough to be dry and impossible to manage without adding more milk... and while the scones looked nice, they were rather tough.

I really like this recipe the way it is. It is not to sweet and has just enough apple for my tastes. The great thing about it, is it's so easy to make, if you want to try more or less of something you can have another batch in no time!

This recipe is a work in progress. I never had scones before, but I think I agree with another review that you need more than one apple.There just was not enough apple flavor in the scone. I enjoyed makeing these, and I'll continue to make them and try to make them better.

Oh very good! I used 2 apples because mine were so small. Less fat than an ordinary scone, but extremely satisfying. Thanks for sharing this recipe. A keeper!

Though I don't know what scone dough is supposed to be like, mine seemed rather dry. However, after I took them out of the oven, the scones were still doughy inside. The flavor was good, but the texture wasn't scone-y enough for me.

Great recipe. I added a glaze made with 1/8 c. apple cider and 1 c. 10X sugar, after baking. Dried apples instead of fresh would give stronger apple flavor-but it was good with chopped, fresh Nittany (kinda like a McIntosh)!

I LOVE this recipe.  I don't like scones that are too sweet and these are just perfect.  They are very quick and easy to make.  I will make these scones again for sure.  I think I will also try different fruit next time (just for something different), the apple is fantastic though!!

Nice recipe.  Not too dry and not too sweet.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and they turned out beautifully.  I wish they had more apple flavor though.

It was my experience that the receipe needed about a third more flower then called for and two apples instead of one.  Also, the cooking time was much to short.  i cooked my first two for 25 minutes and they were still a little doughy in the middle.  And no, my oven temperatures are calibrated correctly.  All in all i found this to be a fair rceipe that with a little teaking could be a very good one.

I just finished eating two of these scones and they are just...DIVINE! They are delicious and very good with some butter and jam. The only change to this recipe was that I added 1 egg because I thought it was too dry before and wouldn't stick together, 1 egg was perfect. I definately will continue to make these all the time, as they're great with tea!

These were okay, but not one of those recipes you make over and over again. IF you like to try new recipes give this a try but if you are one that only want that tried and true recipe, this is probably not your best choice.

Delicious for breakfast or afternoon tea. Not too sweet- best served warm with a bit of butter. Everyone I have made this for has raved about it. Very simple to make!

This was my first time making scones.  Loved them!  I used Rome Beauty apples and the flavor and texture were perfect.  For me, this one's a keeper.

These were awesome!  My whole family loved them.  I loved the subtle flavor of apples and cinnamon.  My family didn't think they were flavorful or cinnamony or sweet enough, but liked them.  We had them for breakfast right outof the oven.  There were a two pieces left on the platter at the end of the day, and I gobbled them up.  i will make these again.

These scones were very good.  I kind of hoped for a strong apple-and-cinnamon flavor, but the subtle flavors I got instead are fine for scones.  I think I would use apple sauce instead of fresh apples next time I make these - I doubt the difference will be notable, but the effort required to prepare the recipe should be dramatically reduced.

This was absolutely delicious. I decided to add an extra apple to make the recipe richer, and, I'm sure as a result, I ended iup baking it for 19 minutes rather than the 15 specified in the recipe. At first, the middle of one of the scones seemed too under-cooked. However, after resting for about 15-20 minutes, it resolved that issue and was wonderful!

A pretty simple recipe to follow, esp. as it was my first time tackling scones (pastries always scare me, I spent days researching scones before finally trying it myself)! I will say I made a couple changes based on what I learned, and what I read in other's reviews. I added about 2tbsp of cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg to the flour mixture.  I also reduced the milk by a third, removed some of the juice from the shredded apple, and added in a handful of raisins. It helped make the mixture less wet, and as Kristiegreen mentioned, more scone-ish. Then I increased the butter by a tbsp. With these additions, the scones were deliciously flavorful! And so very soft and flaky.

I made these and found them quite enjoyable, although I would have preferred a stronger flavour. I have since branched out, partially inspired by this recipe, and created my own apple spice scones which are a definite favourite. So thanks to this recipe for the inspiration!

Made exactly as written- good but not great. I do not get any apple flavor from these scones.Even the cinnamon/sugar mix on top does not add much flavor. Very tender and easy to make and have to agree that they are better with a cup of tea but for me- meh.

I followed the recipe to a t but the scones turned out terrible. The dough was too soft and it was impossible to knead it. And they didn't rise in the oven at all. It's really disappointing because they look nice on the outside and the smell is great but inside there's just a clump of dough not appetizing at all.

Great outline, but I increased the flour by 1/2 cup, used 1 whole stick of butter, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1 tablespoon of chia seeds (for fiber), and finally two apples instead of one.  All other measurements were fine and the dough was perfect for the food processor.

This is a very good scone recipe. The great thing about it is one could add nuts, which I did, and other spices. I used brown sugar instead of white and forgot to shred the apples, finely chopping instead. As one viewer suggested, I added 1 tsp cinnamon to batter instead of topping. I sometimes lightly glaze scones with powdered sugar and lemon juice when scones come out of oven and will try that in future instead of the milk, sugar, cinnamon. I recommend cutting each round into 6 separated  pieces before baking. Yes, I made changes, but I know this would be a great recipe as written. My family loved them.

I read the reviews regarding this recipe's blandness.   To up the flavor , I used applesauce in place of 1/2 of the milk and added cinnamon to the batter. It didn't help. There is no richness in the flavor.   This recipe goes out.

These were very good although they were a bit more moist than a traditional scone. I actually added a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract as suggested by other reviews. They have a very subtle apple flavor considering I used a very large Granny Smith apple. I will definitely make them again.

Very, very pleased with these scones.  I did sub honey for the sugar in the scones (used 'raw' sugar in the topping).

Loved it, I added some 1/4 teaspoon of clove and 1/2 vanilla to bring out the apple and cinnamon flavor, and I chopped it in small chunks instead of shredding it,  amazing  recipe

I made these in my food processor just to make things easier on me. I didn't change the recipe with the exception that I had to add more flour to get the right consistency. I am not a sweet person, and I liked the scones. They were a bit bland, so the next batch I will add the nutmeg and cloves.

Everytime I make these scones, my family and friends grab them off the plate before they even cool off.  I LOVE this recipe!

These were very fragrant and tender with nice crispy crust.  My husband  loves them for breakfast.  I added cinnamon , a pinch of allspice and ginger to the flour mix.  I also added about 1/2cup of raisins.  I will be making these again.

Wonderful subtle flavour... I would make these again, but I would lower the temperature to 375°f and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or more time in 5 minute intervals  if needed...

Flavor was good and the exterior was nicely crunchy which is a real plus, but the interior texture was slightly rubbery. I make A LOT of scones & I'm pretty sure it was just a matter of the recipe only calling for a quarter cup of butter, but a half cup of milk. The recipe is good enough that I think I'll swap those quantities and use 1/2 cup butter & a 1/4 milk... I also might go crazy & mix some additional cinnamon into the batter.

I made  the scone  dough  according  to the  recipe. I made a glaze (to drizzle after baking) from powdered  sugar and apple cider instead of the milk and sugar topping in the recipe . I will make these again !

Such an easy recipe! I added cinnamon, nutmeg and a bit of clove to the batter for more flavour. Next time I plan to make them with apple and cheddar!

This recipe tasted very yummy.   However, the dough was really moist and hard to work with.  I did use half whole wheat flour and left the peel on the apple, but those changes should not have made it extra wet.  Because of the excess moisture, I did not brush the top with milk before adding the cinnamon (double what the recipe called for) and sugar.   All in all, this is a decent recipe.

Oh SO good. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients and it added that perfect little something extra. I heard it was a little wet so I added about a cup of rolled oats. It's still a little doughy but it came out pretty nice, next time I'll add a little more I think. Definitely my go-to scone recipe.

These came out really good! I should have followed another user's directions and cut the milk in half though. I ended up having to put in well over a 1/2 cup of flour just to make it not so sticky. I also used 2 granny smith apples and shredded them in the food processor. To the flour mix, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cream of tartar, and 1/4 tsp allspice. They turned out amazing! I even went and added my own icing (1 cup powdered sugar, 4 1/2 tsp milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract) and drizzled it over the top.

I was a bit disappointed that they are not the kind of flaky english scones that are cakey. 
I will not make this recipe again.

The best scones i've made to date. Didn't have apple so i used a couple of carrots, yummy!!!  It took 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1/2. Scones were light and flavorful. Will definitely make them again, who knows what fruit or veggies I'll try next!!!

Very delicious! Made exactly per recipe except I went  just a little light on the milk. And honestly I could've gone a little lighter. I think that's due to the very juicy apple I used to make it. They have a nice light sweetness all by themselves, but with clotted cream and curds they are divine!

I made tiny changes: added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tbsp brown sugar to the flour mixture since others said it was bland. I didn't put the topping because I added the flavour throughout. Brushed a bit of butter on the tops when they came out of the oven. 

Not too sweet, not to much apple. Just yum! 

This was my first attempt at scones and they turned out prefectly. My oven runs hot so they were ready in 11 mins.

I wish they were a bit light and flaky, but these are cakier than scones I've had at cafe. Still, my husband and his coworker loved them. I made these before he went off to work...the coworker said anytime I make them, send him some. Looks like a hit for my first attempt.

Yummy, my family loved them. I added a little extra flour because my apple was very large and the dough was sticky. I also added 1 tsp of apple pie spice and 1/8 tsp cardamom.

I don't know what I did wrong. I was unable to work with the dough as it was sticky. Pushed forward anyway. I added nutmeg like a previous review said. That was all I tasted. Not sure I will try again. Looking for advice from more experienced bakers as to what I did wrong to get sticky dough.

after reading a lot of the reviews, this is how I changed these. I chopped 1 pink lady apple and grated a golden delicious apple first, then added 1/2 teaspoon  apple pie spice then  let that stand while  I mixed the dry, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  added the apple and milk  patted it out  and kneaded it 5-6 times. turned out really good for our taste.  
 One reader said she could taste the baking powder . I use  aluminum- free baking powder.  no baking powder taste. this item can be found in most stores in the baking isle right beside the regular baking powder.  this also works well in biscuits.   Will try these again and use more spices. they were easy to make and disappeared very quickly.

My pan only makes only 8 instead of 12.  I used the whole apple instead of 5/8 of an apple and it was not to much.  I also added Apple pie spice and the cinnamon recommended and they were not over spiced.  I will definitely make them again. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this as an Easter lunch for my roommates and myself. It was a hit! My only complaint was that it was hard to taste the apple, next time I will use a stronger tasting or a bigger apple. I threw some cinnamon straight into the dough, as well. It took a while to bake through, but that's because I realized I'd forgotten to slice my circles into the 6 wedges, I imagine it bakes better then you don't forget important steps. I think all things said and done, I've found my new Easter tradition! Goes great with butter and jam, or any spread you prefer.

This recipe is amazing all though I did add a few things to it and I didn't sheared the apple, I added 3 teaspoons of applesauce and some cinnamon in the dough and they turned out pretty good. But for my oven I had to turn the heat down and broil them for a couple minutes so they would cook. Kallea

Fluffy - they rose beautifully, very tasty but I absolutely cannot taste any apple. I read a number of the reviews which stated the same thing so I diced the apple, instead of shredding it, to get more direct apple taste but it made no difference.  BTW, I didn't bother with the baking soda - it isn't needed. I did use a bit more baking powder.  I'll have to continue my search for a really good apple scone.

I made one change to this recipe, I added raisins to it.  I made the first batch of this recipe as printed.  They tasted very good, but decided raisins would make them even better.  So I added 3/4 of a cup of raisins to the recipe and that one little addition made them taste so awesome.  So my review is based off of the batch I made with raisins.  This recipe is going to be a regular around our house.

These were great. I used European sour cream for the milk and increased sugar to a half cup after reading reviews and they were very delish. Did need a little more flour though as well

delicious. i added a bit of cinnamon in the batter, and it really helped bring out the apple flavor. i'm going to experiment with a drizzled icing o go on these, as i think that would be fab as well

excellent! easy to make, fluffy, and delicious! a good size too. nice snack sized to have with a coffee at work instead of going to the shop :) I also made them with garlic and chedder. Nix the sugar, and add a splash extra milk. Worked perfectly!

My son is allergic to eggs, so it's always a challenge to find eggless baking recipes - but this is a WOW!  I have 3 little boys, none of which are big eaters, and they ate the entire batch in 1 morning - I had to make another batch the next day.  I added both cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg to the dough - YUM!  I did find that I had to bake them a bit longer than the recipe says - about 20 minutes.

I made these scones because I had a lot of apples in the house that were about to go bad and I didn't want to waste them. I adjusted the recipe slightly to fit my families needs. Since I couldn't make the scones dairy I substituted margarine for the butter and rice milk for the milk. I also added chocolate chips to the scones since many reviews stated that they needed a little more zing. Instead of making the dough into circles and filling them with the sugar and cinnamon I rolled the dough into three inch circles and sprinkled the sugar mixture on top. I will probably make this again!

These were tasty, due to the spices I added per someone's suggestion, but not very much apple flavor. I suggest adding twice the apple.

Great recipe. I doubled this recipe, used whole wheat flour, skipped all of the white sugar and used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon in to the recipe. The result was amazing!

Absolutely delicious!!
Instead of 1 apple I added about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of finely chopped apple, and a little honey to the milk "topping" in step 2. Also recommend not using a mixer, use a wooden spoon- results will be better for the dough. 
All in all a new family favorite, I will definitely be making these again. I only just took them out of the oven and already over half are gone. 2 batches next time I think!

This is great. I made this recipe as written and it was delicious. But it would be even better if some cinnamon was added to the dough itself as other people have written. Also, needs to be some more apple. The apple flavor was not strong enough.

Didn't taste the apple at all.. maybe needs some apple sauce and some spices in the batter. Not sweet enough, but that's a personal preference. Might try again with alterations

best scones ever. hands down. i used whole wheat flour, added 1 tsp cinnamon to the dough as well as 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp allspice. this added insane delicious flavor. also chop up the apple and mince it as opposed to grating the apple.  it ensures you really taste the apple and texture of it.  i brushed melted butter over all the scones once i pulled them out of the oven. DELICIOUS

I cut the servings in half and my scones turned out perfect.  This was my first attempt at making scones so I was really surprised how easy it was.  They were so fluffy and soft - I will never buy scones again.   I did also add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and added a whole apple in stead of a half (I only made a half batch) the my scones where full of flavor.  I made them tonight for breakfast tomorrow morning - they never made it past the cooling rack!   Today, I made these again but instead of apple and cinnamon I used orange (pulp) and clove.  They turned out delectable.  I also topped these with an orange glaze

I loved these! Also added some cinnamon to the recipe. They are best when fresh as they are so nice and crisp on the outside, moist on the inside.   I had many leftovers so I've been microwaving them when I want a piece. Great stuff!

This recipe was pretty good. It can also be made with water for lactose intolerancy, but use half as much cuz water is thinner. I chopped my apple into small slices and bits, which works well. Yum!

These are great scones!  My twist to these already good scones is to increase the sugar to 1/2 c,lactaid milk to 1/2c add 1 tsp Maple flavoring, 1/2 tsp of allspice and forgo the currants.  I formed these into individual scones, patted them in flour and then after placing them on baking sheets, sprinkled  with sugar and cinnamon.  I baked them for approx 12-15 minutes.   They were wonderful!!

I also found that reducing the milk was necessary and spice was needed, so I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. each of nutmeg and allspice.  They were a huge hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was not good. I had to add almost 3 times as much milk to get a dough. I had to make it for 25 minutes rather than 15. It smelled really good while baking and tasted wonderful but was still a little doughy and left a bad aftertaste. I will be taking this one out of my recipe box.

Bottom line: these are pretty good.  Their flavor isn't going to blow you away, but they have a nice consistency to them.  They would be a good side for a Sunday breakfast or brunch.  I added cinnamon to the dough, and I got a decent (gentle) flavor out of a fuji apple.  (I left the skin on because I hate peeling apples.)  I also substituted soy milk, and because I had some "dying" grapes in the fridge, I quartered about 1/4 cup and added them in.  (Remember not to stir/kneed too hard! This is not a wine press! lol).  I definitely think I'll make them again, but I want to investigate adding nutmeg, and probably allspice.

This is a good recipe for what it is- light, fluffy, and very, very Starbucks. I usually like classic scones, very dense and craggy with a bit of buttermilk tang. This is more like cake than bread- not really what I want in a scone. If that's what you're looking for this is a good recipe. Not very strong apple taste- maybe add a splash of cider?

The apple scones turned out pretty good although I made many changes to the recipe. I added a palmful of brown sugar and a bit of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. I also used light soymilk instead of the milk. I was disappointed that it wasn't very sweet, so I made a cinnamon glaze and drizzled it on each scone. The major problem I had with the scones was that they turned out very cakelike, which was not the texture I was going for.

This is what real scones should taste like...not the dried out baking powder tasting scones you spend so much for at those coffee places,  The recipe is so simple and it tastes soooooo good.  I am always asked to bring this to tea.

This was great! I used three chopped Granny Smith apples and the consistency held together very well. I added to the batter cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and vanilla, but it was too much and didn't taste sweet enough. Next time I will add 1t cinnamon, 1/4t nutmeg, and 1t vanilla.

Not a lot of flavor, not sure if it needs more apple, more cinnamon or more of everything! But decent when you want something to slather butter on and have with a cup of tea.

These were very good, though more moist than the scones I'm used to.  More muffin-like.  I added cinnamon to the dough as suggested by others, and I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, as that's all I had.  Also, I finely chopped the granny-smith apple instead of shredding it, as this seemed easier, and I added raisins for extra sweetness.  Yum!  Finally, whenever I make scones, I never bother to shape them.  I just scoop them out into big blobs on my baking stone, like with lumpy-bumpy biscuits (if you know what I mean by that).  Much easier and they taste the same no matter how they look.  I will definitely make these again, though probably with regular milk.

I made these following the exact recipe. I thought they were too salty. Otherwise, the consistency was good. There was a nice mild apple taste but could not get past the salt. Next time I would halve the amount of salt or omit altogether and add some cinnamon and nutmeg.

My experience with these wasn't as good as I expected.  They can out really moist almost like a biscuit.  There wasn't much apple flavor even though I used fresh baking apples from the orchard.  I probably won't make these again.  :-(

Not great.  Followed some suggestions by other reviewers, but still found them bland at best.  Had to give them some taste by using a lot of Jam.

I made this recipe before I went to work this morning.  It took a little longer than 15 minutes to prepare and I baked them as drop scones instead of wedges, but the taste is fantastic, the consistency is perfect, and at 3 points, is so much better than the 11 point scones at Starbucks!

Very tasty, but mine turned out more like a coffee cake than a scone.  Will definitely try again perhaps using less milk.

This is a great scone recipe. I highly recommend it.  I changed the baking powder and added cinnamon and nutmeg into the batter.  I did not want to use my milk since I only had enough left until tomorrow so I used half and half.  I will make this again!

They were ok, a little softer then I thought scones tasted.  My husband thought they were good.  I think next time I will add cinnamon into the mix as well as on top and cook for a few minutes longer.

My dough was way to sticky to pat into a round.  I had to add more flour. Overall they taste OK, but I have had much better luck with Grandma Johnson's scones from this website.

Not bad, but not great either. More like cake than scones. A plus could be that these have less fat than scones typically do. Not a whole lot of taste.

I just made these for the kids for after-school.  I'm giving them 4 stars because my picky 6 yr old really liked them.  My daughter and I thought they were just okay.  Pretty much a sweet biscuit.  We agreed that they definitely were better with butter. Couldn't really taste the apple.  Will make again if my little one wants me to, otherwise, probably not.

In the interest of time I chopped the apple instead of shredding it and used a cookie scoop to make "mini" scones. I rolled them in the cinnamon sugar mixture before baking. A tasty treat.

It was good. You might want to eat with Apple Jam and butter, since scones are not sweet. I had them with cream cheese and honey and they were really good!

I made this recipe as writted, but used 2 small granny smith apples and added about 1 tbsp vanilla.  I also used my Nordic Ware scone pan and they came out PERFECT looking.  They are, however, a bit plain.  Definitely good to eat, but a little on the plain-tasting side.  Next time I think I'll add a little cinnamon to the actual dough.  Otherwise, these are very quick and easy to make and don't require a lot of ingredients.

I would definitely cut down on the liquid as others have mentioned.  Otherwise, the flavor is subtle and the butter comes through well.  I couldn't taste the apple too much, but a dash of cinnamon complemented the overall taste.

Still not quite the scone I'm looking for, but it may have been due to my alterations. I realized I had no baking apples, so I went with strawberries and shredded coconut. I added a heaping half-teaspoon of cinnamon and went with half whole-wheat. Not too fluffy or too sweet. They rose more than I expected to next time I'll flatten them out more.

I loved these scones.  I made half the batch, but still used a whole granny smith apple, diced up.  Likely too much apple for the dough, but I loved them.  I also added cinnamon to the batter, since I love cinnamon.  I also replaced the butter with light Becel margarine, next time I'm going to try replacing the sugar with Splenda and see how it goes.

These were really good, but I think it needs a lot more apple. Also, we sprinkled alot of cinnamon & sugar on the top. The house smelled fantastic!!

a very simple recipe, i substituted the apple with a pear, but i didn't taste it at all in the scone. hopefully an apple is more flavorful! i did add a bit more extra sugar & 1tsp of cinnamon into the scone. i like the recipe & the resulting scones, but the texture isn't as flakey as i would have liked. oh well, i enjoyed making these!

I changed things a bit with this recipe - cut the milk in half to 1/4 cup, added 1/2 ts to the dry mixture, and added a 1/4 ts of vanilla with the milk and shredded apple. I also used two apples instead of one. Even with cutting the milk in half, the dough was ridiculously sticky. Initially I thought it wouldn't be a big deal and that I would tough it out, but it was literally so sticky it couldn't be worked or kneaded at all. We ended up adding close to another cup of flour while trying to knead it, just to make it manageable. However, the taste was WONDERFUL and it smelled soooo good while baking - my only complaint with the finished product was that it was very cakey, but I'm assuming this was a mistake on my part about how I cut the butter in, or possibly the fact that I had to add so much flour when kneading. My only other complaint is that they don't freeze well. We had three left and stuck them in the freezer, and defrosted them the next day and they were soggy and moldy - but, this is probably because of my freezer.

Ok third time is def not the charm here. Again, it was not like I'd thought i'd be. It was saltly, and dense. It was an ok treat, but I don't think i'll make this recipe again. So I am on the lookout for another apple scone recipe....sorry, I really tried.

i had high hopes these scones would be wonderful but was disappointed by the stickiness of the dough which lead to the addition of more flour, hence a longer baking time & much heavier scone. earlier, i noted a review that suggested adding the milk slowly to control the texture but forgot that part when i made them (oops). anyway, this recipe get 3 stars because even though they were overbaked & crunchy, the scones still tasted fairly good! i used a golden delicious apple, half whole wheat flour & served them warm from the oven with butter. thanks carol, next time i'll remember to check my personal notes....

Tasted pretty good but the apple flavor wasn't that strong. The center of our scones were still a little doughy after 18 minutes but it might be that we rolled them to thick. They're wonderful wtih slivered almonds on top!

I found it had an excellent buttery and chewy center. I added raisins to mine to give it a bit more flavor. Unlike some other reviews, I found that the baking time was perfect and I didn't need to add any more liquid to the dough. It really quick and easy to make.

Delicious!  The flavor was great with just the right amount of sweetness. The only problem I had was that my dough was a little too wet- I added some extra flour.  I will double the recipe next time and serve it Christmas morning with breakfast.

We make scones all the time at our house and they tend to come out dry.  The scones in this recipe were very moist.  The apple flavor was not as noticable as I was hoping for, but it may have just been the type of apples we used.

quite tasty and quick.  Plan to try adding raisins next time.  We did add 1 tsp cinnamon to the dough and it tasted great!

p.s.  adding a handful of raisins to the dough makes these even better!

These "scones" are more like an apple quick bread.  They are not at all like a true scone.  However, they are nice for breakfast.

Scrumptious!  Eat one serving and you'll go for another one or two.  Never liked scones until I tried this one.  Even my husband loves it!  How about a few chopped pecans added to the cinnamon/sugar topping or in the dough?  Worth a try for pecan lovers.

Somehow, my scones were too burnt on the outside and raw on the inside.  Maybe I did something wrong..  However, the smell while cooking was delicious.

These are easy to make and taste wonderful. I have made them even healthier for me by using "Lighter Bake" to sub for shortening,egg substitute (sometimes) and "Splenda" ( sometimes) for sugar substitute..and my diabetic friends can eat them safely.

These were easy to make and very delicious.  I even added a little bit of cinnamon to the dough.
Thanks for the recipe.
