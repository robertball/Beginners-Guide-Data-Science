Tasty cookie with a very soft texture because of the cream cheese. The cranberries worked well in here, although my kids said they'd prefer them without. Funny how quickly they disappeared though!

Excellent recipe and so easy for snickerdoodles! Only change I made was to add about a teaspoon of nutmeg to the sugar and cinnamon the cookies get rolled into before baking. 

Also worth mentioning - I don't know if I just made my cookies small or what but I got WAY more than 48 cookies out of this recipe! I'd say at least 65/70!

The cranberries sounded like a great idea for a different type of snickerdoodle.  I followed the recipe exactly. The cream cheese made the dough very different and when the cookies were done, they tasted like biscuits or scones. I didn't care for them.
