My whole family loved it! I did use all ground beef. I put the ground beef in raw with step one, but only cooked on high about an hour, then switched to low. Left out the cinnamon (just now realized that). Had to sub a garden fresh bell pepper for the celery. I also didn't add the water, my slow cooker seems to make a lot of water on its own. I only had diced tomatoes so I subbed the Black Beans for a can of chili beans (gave me the chili seasonings that the chili tomatoes would have). We love flavor, so my pinches were probably more like spoonfuls (except no salt, we have to eat low sodium). I also forgot the corn. Delish!! I can't wait for the leftovers. Today I'm going to eat it more like a dip on garden veggie crackers.

I made this for the Recipe Group Selection: 06, October 2012. Both my husband and I love sweet potatoes and have put them in our chili and soups before. I didn't have canned tomatoes with green chilies and so I chopped up a poblano and chili pepper from my garden and added in with regular diced tomatoes. I only used one pound of ground meat, no pork. I dashed the cinnamon and to me it is the spice that makes this chili different from your many run of the mill chili dishes, gives that earthy fall flavoring. I have an old crock pot that doesn't cook too hot and five hours on high was perfect. I did pre-brown my ground meat with some onions until it just turned pink, drained and added it in the beginning with all the other ingredients. I also did the open and stir once in awhile as the directions indicated, something I usually never do with crock pots, but it was needed to move around the sweet potato chunks since they seemed to like to float to the top. Everything that said a pinch, got a dash or two. Nice thickness to this and not too spicy. We topped with green scallions, cheddar cheese and sour cream. Smells so wonderful while cooking.

Nice flavors in this. Sweet potatoes were done way before the 5 hrs on high. I didn't have the 1/2 ground beef handy so made whole amount with the ground turkey. I will do this recipe again but will cook on low and just throw all the ingredients in the slow cooker at the same time, no prebrowning I think is needed.

Wow! I would not change anything. The proportions are great already. The only thing I changed, because I didn't have any, was that I used a few shakes of Franks Hot Sauce instead of the cayenne pepper. I cut up everything and put it in a gallon ziploc bag the night before. The next morning, we just dumped it into the crock pot, turned it on low and let it cook all day long. Do NOT add any water - the steam from the crock pot makes plenty of liquid. Everyone is on their second bowl tonight, with a request to never make regular chili again! Ha! I would have never thought that sweet potatoes would be good in a chili, but they are really tasty! One thing I would suggest - after dicing your sweet potatoes, you might want to nuke them a little bit first. Ours were not 100% soft, even after cooking all day long. But, that could be a variance in taters too. 
Thank you for sharing your great recipe - it will become a standard at our house now too! ?

UPDATE: I won 3rd place in a friends and family chili cook off with this one! Thank you to salt&light for posting this fabulous recipe. I have made it an unofficial rule (very strong advice, lol) that this be eaten with fat free Greek yogurt mixed in! It gives it a hearty creaminess that is guilt-free! Yum!!! This chili is so friggin' awesome! It's mostly like a "normal" chili, but the sweet potatoes and touch of cinnamon give it a little nudge into something magically perfect for Autumn. I didn't bother with stewed, chili-seasoned tomatoes, I just used regular old canned diced tomatoes and increased the seasonings (except cinnamon) a little. No problem. Used chicken broth instead of water. Also only cooked on high 3 hours before adding the meat. First time I made it, I used all beef. I have my second batch cooking now, using 3/4 turkey, 1/4 beef (what I have on-hand) and I quadrupled the recipe using 2 crock pots, because I am entering this recipe in a chili cook-off my friend is hosting on Sunday. I will come back with an update soon! I served this with fat free Greek yogurt (sour cream is a thing of the past- I can use ALL the Greek yogurt I want, with NO guilt! It tastes the same, try it!!) chopped scallions, oyster crackers, and shredded cheddar cheese. My husband and I thought we'd died and gone to heaven. We looked forward to eating the leftovers every day, 2 meals a day, for 3 days. I can't say enough good things about this. Try it!!!

Recipe Group Selection:  06, October 2012 ~ Great twist on chili.  I love sweet potatoes, hubby does not.  I made the soup while he was gone so he would not see me add the sweet potatoes.  He had the soup for dinner before I got home.  He liked the flavor of the soup, but wanted to know what the orange things were.  I told him it was carrot chunks.  He wasn't so sure about that, but that is how I left it.  I put all the ingredients in the crockpot in the morning, and cooked on low all day.  Since the soup would be cooking all day, I did omit the 1/2 cup water.  The texture and taste of this chili was delicious and I will make it again, "carrots" and all!  Thanks salt&light for sharing.

A wonderful lower fat and more nutritious chili recipe!  Hubby and I loved this, would be great for a Halloween party, the colors and flavors are so seasonal.  I took a little liberty with the cooking method...I used all ground turkey, browned with onion and added some garlic and cumin, s & p, and added to the crock.  All of the other ingredients went in, and I used liberal amounts of most of the seasonings (except the cayene!).  Cooked this in the crock on high 4 hours, turned down to low for an hour and a half or so.  Perfect.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, this is a keeper.

Used all ground beef and omitted cayenne for the kids. Served with chopped avocado, green onions, and sour cream. The entire family ate it up!

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I read a review where someone put everything in at the same time and just let it cook and it was okay but not great. The second time the changes I made were only to ingredients: used chicken stock instead of the water, no celery (preference), 2 cloves garlic minced and toward the end I added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to thicken it a bit. I found it to be much more balanced and delicious this time following the directions of browning the meat (all turkey) and adding it with the beans and corn about an hour before serving it. Very filling and delicious.

Nice tasting chili. Easy to prepare. No substitutions or omissions. It is somewhat thin or has juice so if you like a thicker chili than I would suggest omitting water or have enough bread as a side. This def. needs the time to soften up the potatoes so plan ahead. If I have extra sw. potatoes around I would make this again.

This has got to be the best chili I've ever made.  Seriously.  My initial thought when reading this recipe that was sweet potato and cinammon don't belong in chili -- but because of the ratings I thought I'd give it try, especially since I was in the mood for something different.  I followed the directions exactly, except I omitted the beef and used ground turkey.  It was delicious the first day, but it was outstanding the second day.  The trick is to eat it the day AFTER you cook it, so there's time for the flavors to mellow together.  I be will using this recipe for our office chili cook-off in February.

This chili was terrific! Wanting to use up some sweet potatoes and ground meat that I had in the freezer I searched for some crockpot recipes and found this one. I'm so glad I found it! A really good hearty chili that took very little prep time. Having 1lb of ground turkey in the freezer to use up, I used all of it and eliminated the ground beef. (only because I had 1lb of turkey meat) The cumin has such a distinct taste that I opted to just use 1/2 tsp instead of 1 tsp which I think was a good call. I put all BUT the meat and beans in and let it go for 3 hours then realised I had to leave the house and wouldn't be back in time to put the meat in when the recipe said. So.... I gave it a quick stir,added the browned turkey meat and covered it for the next 5 hrs until I got home. When I got back,I threw in the beans and shut the crockpot off. Within the next 20 min we were sitting down eating this really good chili! I suggest that you stir the ingredients only when you first put them in and not again until the meat and beans are added. Crockpot recipes are not generally intended to have the cover removed until the cooking time is up. I WILL be making this often and add the ground beef the next time to see how good that tastes! Perfect! A great spicey, flavorful and hearty dinner. Thanks for a really good recipe!

This is soooo good. We've made it twice, once with all ground beef, once with all ground turkey. You can't go wrong either way.

Made this for Recipe Group [I tweaked this all over the place, and probably  shouldn't have, since it was for recipe group, but I did . . .] . . . I just was not in a meat mood - and definitely not feeling ground meat, for some reason. SO, I bought a package of turkey breast tenderloins. I diced them up, and browned half [~10 oz...?] in olive oil in my 5 qt pot. I used extra celery and onion. [Did not measure.] I could not find the diced tomatoes, so I bought sliced - but had to dice them myself, ultimately - the slices were too big for my taste. Because I was going short on the meat, I added a second can of black beans, and a can of pintos. I brought the turkey, sweets, and tomatoes to a boil while I diced the other veggies, added the spices, beans and corn, brought back to a boil, covered, and lowered to a simmer, for about an hour. The chili is GOOD! BUT, I will probably leave out the cinnamon next time. I know it's not a sweet spice - but I associate it with sweets - and while the taste is not bothering me, the scent is off-putting . . .  By the way, I left out the water. As I read the reviews, I kept thinking that my chili did not come out thin or runny, but just realized now, that I did not even see water in the ingredient list [and so, left it out]. I will do it the same way next time. My biggest tweak was probably making this a one-pot meal and doing the whole thing on the stovetop . . . I shared this with co-workers and my  mom, and everyone who tried it, loved it =D

I love thie recipe but I have made four minor changes:  (1) I reduced the cumin to half just because I am not a fan of cumin. (2) I used all beef and no turkey. (3) I put the diced sweet potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes to soften them up before going into the crock pot. (4) I put ALL the ingredients in at once in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours (turned out just great!).

We really enjoyed this.  I took the advice of the other reviewer and added everything at once and cooked on low.  Really hardy.

This is my family's favorite chili and I've made quite a few 5 star chilis from AllRecipes. I did not change a thing other 1) zapping my cut up sweet potatoes in the microwave for 60 seconds before throwing them in the crock pot and 2) adjusting my cooking time since crock pots are different and mine runs HOT. I cooked on high for just 4 hours and during the last hour, added my browned meat.

Even better on day 2!

Delicious, interesting, pretty. Also, because of the low bean content (ahem) this is not really a gas-inducing chili which is a thumbs up for us ;).

Delicious!  I couldn't find stewed tomatoes with chili seasonings, so I just used regular.  It was fine.  Didn't have any corn so I left that out and I really don't think it needs it.  This was the perfect combo of spices and we enjoyed it a lot!

Just got an email from the hubby that says 'I love it - don't change a thing!'  Yeah....it's that good.  Surprised at how much we loved this - I thought the sweet potato might throw off the chili with how sweet they are but this is really really good; and so easy to boot!  Left out the cinnamon and glad I did (I can't stand cinnamon in my chilis or savory food in general).  As others mentioned, my sweet potatoes were done way earlier than 5 hours on high, I will start checking at 3 hours next time.  I wasn't sure what 'stewed tomatoes with chili seasonings' was - was this chili spices or was it green chilis so I subbed 2 cans of whatever that was with 2 cans of Rotel (one hot and one original - my mouth is on fire right now!  Need to remember to ease up on the cayenne if using hot Rotel next time) and it worked out well. Slightly less in volume (10 oz vs 14.5 oz), but perfect in texture/taste.  This is a great way to use up that box of sweet potatoes you bought for Thanksgiving!  Loved the mix of turkey/beef (I do this for taco soup too). Sadly this only made 4 servings for us, not 8.

Way too much cinnamon, and not enough of the savory spices.  If I were to make again, I would cut back on the cinnamon and turn up the heat/spices.

I made this a few weeks ago for dinner with friends, we were meant to have 6 for dinner, and since a few are big eaters I more than doubled the recipe. I also changed the recipe a bit for no other reason than a whim. Instead of the ground turkey & beef I used 2 lbs of sweet Italian sausage, removed from casings. I sauteed a lg, diced onion along with 4 cloves of garlic & a few stalks of celery. I used chicken broth, cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, a bit of Cayenne pepper & brown sugar to taste. I used 6 lg sweet potatoes - some cubed & some diced - & a lg bag of frozen corn. I put it all in the slow cooker together & let it cook on low for about 8 hrs. 
One reason I made so much was because I planned to put some in the freezer, give some to my parents & some to my brother. Ha! That didn't happen! I thought our guests were going to lick the slow cooker clean! It was that good! You can be sure I will be making this again. I also plan to make this recipe as written.

This was really different... and delicious!  Changed it slightly due to ingredients on hand.  Deleted all meat.  Used home canned tomatoes instead of stewed, 1 can Rotel, and hot Mexican chili spice instead of regular chili powder.  Added kidney beans.  Have already passed along the recipe and will make again.

The flavor on this was amazing!  Made a few minor changes with one batch, but this is fantastic as written.  Completely left out the cayenne pepper as there are some sensetive tongues in my household and went with diced tomatoes rather than stewed as it's what we had on hand.  Ended up cooking for about 9 hours total.  Sweet potatoes were very tender and the whole meal was very hearty and great for a cold fall evening.

This recipe is one awesomely delicious soup.  I didn't follow the recipe to a t, as I eyeballed the spices, drastically increasing the amount of both cumin and chili powder (1t and 1T, respectively is not enough even if I hadn't doubled the recipe) in addition to the meat (2 lbs.) and tomatoes (3 cans).  The addition of the sweet potatoes made it extremely filling, limited my serving to just one bowl rather than the one and a half I'll usually have of chili/soup at dinner time.  The cinnamon, while present, didn't overwhelm like I was worried about while preparing it.  The celery also added a nice textural element to it as well.

I will be making this again.  Guaranteed!

Only changes I made to simplify things was cut potatoes to the size of home style fries, made everything that was a "pinch" 1/4 tsp, drained and used entire can of corn, entire medium sweet onion since some are huge, closer to a cup of celery, and cooked 8 hrs low, putting the burger, beans and corn in the last 3 hrs.  Corn bread muffins were great to eat AND crumbled on top! Was chunky with only a little liquid. Wife and daughter really liked it even though not sweet potato fans

Yum!  I used a pound of ground beef (no turkey), browned it, and threw it in with the rest of the ingredients right at the start.  Also omitted the water. Worked great! The combination of flavors was so yummy!  Spicy and a bit sweet - perfect!  My husband loved it too!

Loved it. Had to make some changes....I can't have beef or turkey or garlic(most chili powders) or black beans . I used ground pork which probably makes it really different. Used green beans in place of black beans. Didn't have any celery. I used a garlic free chili powder(recipe I found online) that I mix that is awesome. Its borderline too much cinnamon, so I've scaled it back a little. Its sweet but has enough heat to make my nose run. I actually think its better as leftovers. I also only had one can of stewed tomatoes, so I used petite cut tomatoes with the chiles, which is perfect. I think of this chili as more of a sweet potatoe stew!

This was delicious! The perfect amount of spice and the cinnamon was actually a good addition. I added white beans in chili sauce and used fire roasted Rotel. Definitely a keeper.

We didn't expect to love this recipe, but it got better with each bite.  The first taste is a little different and it really grows on you and now I make it at least once a month.

I made this for Bunco and the ladies loved it!! I didn't have chili seasoned tomatoes, so just used plain tomatoes with a recipe of chili seasoning added in i place of the other seasonings (+ the cinnamon). I also added a bottle of beer because I like my chili a little more like soup. It was very good.

Perhaps it's because we have my standard chili recipe that's delicious, but my husband and I were quite disappointed in this sweet potato chili. I used ground beef rather than adding turkey, but the recipe was too sweet and bland for us. I sampled it when I got home and added a can of Ranch Beans with jalapenos to try to add flavors. It still didn't work for us, and we did not save the leftovers for another day...unheard of around here!

I added a yellow and orange pepper chopped and I used chicken broth (14.5 oz can) instead of water.  When I added the black beans I put a can of refried beans in too.  Absolutely delicious.  I love sweet potatoes, but like some of the other reviewers, I was apprehensive about how they would go with chili.  This is the only way I will make chili from now on.   My husband doesn't even like sweet potatoes but he liked this.

A friend had mentioned putting sweet potatoes in her chili, so when I saw this I had to try it! On issue is I don't have a slow cooker, but I cooked this in a pot on the stove and it turned out great! I didn't have diced tomatoes with seasoning so I just added extra of the required spices with the exception on cinnamon. I also omitted the tomato sauce and added 1.5c vegetable broth to keep it from getting too thick. I only used ground turkey instead of beef. Definitely a recipe to pass along to friends!

This was absolutely fabulous!  Easy and fairly inexpensive.  Cooked 4 hrs, added final ingredients and then went another 1 1/2 hrs.  Will cut back to 4 plus 1 next time as sweet potatoes had little consistency.  Makes a thick stew-like soup.  Will be a regular in our home.

I made this for dinner today. Only saw the recipe at 4PM which was too late for the crockpot, so I browned the meat first then added it to the other ingredients in a stock pot, brought up to a boil then simmered for 45 min. The potatoes were very tender. The whole meal was delicious. I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes outside of a pie, but this was a great use of my extra potatoes.

This was a great recipe! I added in black eyed peas for additional bulk and less on the turkey/beef. I just added everything in and set on low for 8 hours - came out perfect. Will make this again.

If you like chili to make your eyes water just a little, this isn't the recipe for you. I was looking for a "twist" on chili, but this wasn't spicy enough for me. I added lots more cayenne pepper and frank's hot sauce before it was the right heat. The sweet potato tasted great in the dish, though.

We are vegetarian, so I'm always looking for great chili recipes!  And I found one!!  The only change I made was I used Wegmans meatless sausage crumbles vice the animal meats listed.  Truly amazing dish!!  Great in the Crock Pot, too!!!

I really enjoyed this soup.  I love sweet potatoes, so it was really nice to have it in this soup.  There's not a lot of heat, so I might add a chipotle pepper next time.  But the flavor is amazing!

I've made this recipe a couple times so far and have really liked it. I made it last night for an annual chili cook-off at work and it did really well.  Obviously, when you're talking about sweet potatoes, it's hit and miss; some people really like them, others can't stand them. I love them and this recipe doesn't disappoint!  I did modify a step, however:  Instead of putting the raw potatoes straight into the crock, I pop them into a large sauce pan with a little olive oil, cinnamon and brown sugar to taste along with the sweet onions, caramelizing both and more importantly, partially cooking the potatoes which cuts the crock cook time in half.  I also doubled the potatoes and excluded the beef and turkey, making it a vegetarian dish.   
All-in-all, an excellent recipe. 
This is one I'll be using for a long time.

We really loved this recipe. This can be changed easily to a vegetarian dish by omitting the meat and adding an extra can of black beans.

This recipe was yummy.  I didn't have time to get it all together in the morning because I was late for work, so I had to make it in a much shorter time frame than allotted in the recipe.  I browned my meat (I used 1.3 lbs lean ground beef) with 1/2 of a yellow onion that was diced.  I also put my sweet potatoes in the microwave for about 8 minutes and then diced them before throwing everything together in the slow cooker.  I cooked it on high for about 2.5 to 3 hours.  It probably wold have been even better if I had been able to follow the recipe exactly, but it was still very good and quite easy.  I would definitely recommend it.  the bf isn't a fan of cumin and thought the taste might have been a little strong, but he still liked it.  I didn't mind it.   We both though it seemed like it might be missing a little something (hence the 4 stars), but again, it was still good!

I left out the water and salt. Used a 1/2 teaspoon for everything that said "pinch." If you love spicy chili like I do, add a jalapeno for good measure.

Delicious!  The sweet potatoes make it a sweeter tasting chili, which I like for a change.  I used lentils instead of black beans, because I always do in chili, and I added some cilantro when adding the meat and lentils, which was yummy.    I don't think it needs to cook on high for as long as the recipe says, I turned it down to low after about 3 hours on high and left it on low for the remaining 3 hours, and it definitely was quite well cooked, the sweet potatoes were quite soft.

Makes excellent chili! I substitued a can of kidney beans for black beans, and actually added some more water because it seemed to be drying up. Came out wonderful and rich in tastes. Next time I'm going to put the beans in from the start to get them softer, and make more! This was only enough for 4 servings, but we couldn't help ourselves...

This was my first slow cooker recipe ever, and boy did it turn out AWESOME!  Used 1lb of beef and 1lb of ground pork to make it meatier.  YUM!  Used a teaspoon rather than a pinch of each spice.  Didn't use the cinnamon.  I added half cup of water, because it looked dry at first, but then it became more liquidy.  I probably wouldn't add the water next time.  Everyone loved it.  Just the right amount of spice.

My 2 sweet potatoes were huge, so I ended up adding extra beans and ground turkey.  I doubled the spices based on reviews and added 1 cup of beef broth part of the way through the cooking because it was drier than we like our chili.  Unique flavors - flavorful but not spicy.  If you like sweet potatoes, give this one a try.  We'll have it again when we're in the mood for a different chili.

Really tasty chili. I made a few small changes: I used three cans of Rotelo diced tomatoes and green chiles, one diced/seeded jalapeno, two cloves garlic and a tablespoon of brown sugar. I garnished with cheddar and low fat sour cream. A unique take on chili that I will definitely use again. Thank you for the great recipe!

I wanted to make this recipe, but my slow cooker was not working.   I made this in my Tupperware microwave pressure cooker in 25 minutes.  My girls are vegetarian so I did not add the meat.  This was delicious and a great hit with the family.  I will definitely make this again using my microwave pressure cooker because it includes ingredients that I usually have on hand and is quick and easy to make.

Made it without crock pot using some frozen precooked sweet potatoes.  Omitted celery in place of extra fresh tomatoes I had.  Browned everything up and let simmer an extra 30 minutes.   Husband declared it even better the 2nd day.

I left out the corn and celery and used 1 lb of lean ground beef.
I also added larger amounts (1/4 teaspoon) of all seasonings that called for only a pinch.
I also used 1 can of garbanzo beans in addition to 1 can of black beans since I wanted more beans but didn't have 2 cans of black beans.
Absolutely would make it again - delicious!!!

Served it to a bigger crowd - everyone liked it a lot. So it will become a great go-to addition for our meal rotation.  I used leftover, shredded turkey rather than ground beef/turkey.  It is great to find good recipes that work well with leftover meats.

It turned out pretty okay. I don’t recommend adding the sweet potatoes. It does nothing for flavor and the texture isn’t the greatest either. Besides all that, it was actually a pretty good chili.

This was wonderful. I only added a pinch of cinnamon and I added a tsp of truffle salt because I love that stuff. I also used only ground beef and browned it about 2/3 the way. Loved it and will use this recipe again.

My husband loved it.  We both had a big bowl garnished with  cheese.  Hubby took another big bowl to work for lunch.  There is something delicious about the flavor combination of sweet potatoes and chili.  I have  saved this in my favorites and will definitely make again.

We love sweet potatoes and this dish is delish! Added more chicken broth because it dried up after 4 hours on high. Browned the meat and added more broth. Of course it’s on the sweeter side and not savory so I upped the chili seasoning and also the onion and garlic and it was perfect!

So good! Made this exactly as directed except I didn’t have any turkey so I used 1 lb ground beef. I also forgot to add black beans and corn at the end and didn’t miss it although I can see how those would be good additions. We didn’t use sour cream or cheese on top but probably will in the future. I tend to have a heavy hand with spices but I think it’s called for here

Great flavor, and the sweet was a nice change of pace from the conventional chili’s. I plan on making this again in the future. I would add a little more seasoning than it calls for due to the offset of both juice and foods.

I Liked it. Cooked it on High for 5 hr low for 1. Turned on Warm and put beans and corn in for last hour on warm. I added 3/4 tsp of cinnamon and should have only added 1/4 tsp. Didnt read reviews before making it like I usually do. All in All. it is good. .Will serve with Wild Rice.

I just made this for the second time this week. I used ground elk for my protein and I adapted it to be cooked on the stovetop. Just brown the onions and ground meat and then simmer all the ingredients until tender, about 20 minutes. Us three adults enjoy the ingredient combo!

Oh my, I made this EXACTLY as is, didn't change one single thing... (except that I could not find ground turkey so I used ground chicken) and I LOVED LOVED LOVED it!!! Amazing!!! Thank you for this recipe, my new favorite!

Second time making -  did with all ground beef. Added one green pepper, diced.   Doubled the cinnamon just because I love cinnamon in chili. Topped with a dollop of sour cream and some green onions. Was a.m.a.z.i.n.g. 

I really love this recipe!

I loved the cinnamon in the stew, my husband, not so much.  I thought it added a freshness to the chili.  Also the sweet potatoes were an awesome addition. I did heat it up a bit, with cayenne pepper, it was an afterthought when the chili was made, next time I will add either serranos or jalapeños for the heat

I put all the ingredients (tweeted some of the spices to my tastes) in a stockpot and simmered for an hour. No pre browning, and NO meat products, excellent Vegan dinner!!

Made this stove top vs. crock pot.  Worked out great!
Trying to find healthier, low calorie, versions of food you
like that will also taste good is getting much easier with all
the great turkey products out there.
This was rich and filling and I was able to cut the calorie count down to 190 calories a portion using the 99% lean ground turkey breast.  
I did add more chili powder and cumin than the recipe called for.  Personal preference.  A squeeze of fresh lime and cilantro were the perfect finish to add some acid to counter the sweetness of the potato.
Husband and son loved it.  It also FREEZES very well, so make a big batch!!
Will definitely make again.

My entire family loved this chili and I will definitely be making it again! I used all ground turkey, didn't add any cinnamon and used more of the savory spices and it was perfect! Anyone that likes spicy chili, then you just have to add some hot sauce or red pepper flakes and that helped. Definitely takes at least an hour or two hours less than the suggested cooking time in the crock pot on high and I ended up switching it to low. I definitely recommend making this though since it was a hit!

The picture does not do I?t justice - so good! I made I?t vegetarian this time and think the consistency is a bit better without the meat or I would add more tomato sauce if I add meat the next time.

Love this chili! I used a chicken bone broth powder to add to water before adding. Added diced red bell pepper just because it needed to be used up. Didn't really measure seasonings, because I believe in seasoning to taste, but they were probably close. Added a bit of Italian herbs blend and omitted cayenne for the kids. Great use for a variety of sweet potatoes I had that needed to be finished off (purple, white, orange). Will be bringing to a church dinner.

Perfect combination of spicy and sweet!  Did not have enough time to use the slow cooker; just steamed the sweet potatoes prior to adding   potatoes right at the very end to the diced tomato sauce spice mixture w/ the sauted onions & ground turkey.  Spices are a perfect combination with just enough cayenne to  make it somewhat  spicy hot.

Misread the directions and didn't realize needed the slow cooker. Made it on the stove top and it came out great. Used 1tsp chili powder and dash of cayenne pepper so not to spicy for kids. Followed the recipe for the rest. Cooked on stovetop for about 1 hr. Came out great.

This was delicious! I knew I wasn't going to be able to cook it in two steps so I put all the ingredients in the crockpot together the night before with a  little extra water. I also used a whole pound of browned turkey, rather than 1/2 turkey 1/2 beef. I took it out of the fridge in the morning, turned it on low and let it cook all day while I worked (10+ hours). As suggested, I garnished with chopped avocado and  green onions ~ beautiful as well as tasty!

The only changes I made was to double the meat. 1 lb burger, 1 lb ground pork. 
Add a can of chili beans with the black beans and a second can of stewed tomatoes  (mexicsn style). 
I  ate two bowls the first night.

Easy to make and very tasty.  I cooked the sweet potatoes, cinnamon and cumin together for 5 minutes to develop the flavor of the spices.  I then sweated the onions with the chili powder.  I added a pinch of sugar to cut down on the acid of the tomatoes  and tomato sauce.  I don't like ground turkey so I used ground bison instead.  
Cooked on high for 3 hours and the potatoes were tender, dropped it to low, added the final ingredients & cooked for another hour.  
Served with corn bread and topped with green onions and cheese.

This recipe is an ok tasting twist on homemade chili. I made it exactly as the recipe suggested. I forgot the cayenne pepper, but I think I made up for it by adding jalapeño peppers at the end. In addition to the jalapeños, I topped it with sour cream and shredded cheese. I'm not sure if I'd make this again. If I do, I'll add a little more salt.

This was pretty tasty. I did add additional enhancements, though. I added half a chicken bouillon and a bay leaf. I was a little nervous about adding cinnamon, but it was actually a nice touch. I only had ground turkey. The sweet potato wasn't too bad, but I may make it again without it.

This chili is fabulous.  I love the sweet potatoes in it.  I couldn't find stewed diced tomatoes with chili seasoning in my supermarket, so I bought diced tomatoes with zesty jalapenos instead.   I also forgot to put the tomato sauce on my shopping list, so I used some Newman's Marinara that I had on hand in its place.  The only change I deliberately made was to use a full pound of ground turkey because my husband doesn't eat beef.  I didn't bother to drain the turkey as it was 93% fat free.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  I didn't find any of the spices overpowering and the final result was nice and thick.  

I was worried when I was cooking the veggies and spices for the first 5 hours because it tasted too hot.  After adding the turkey , corn, and beans, and letting it cook for another 2 hours, I found that it mellowed out and had just enough heat.  This is my go-to chili recipe from now on!                                                                                                                                                                                              


UPDATED December 2017:  I've made this chili a bunch of times since my earlier review.  I have a very old crockpot, which takes extra time to soften the sweet potatoes.  In order to be finished in time for dinner, I wrapped the sweet potatoes in wet paper towels and microwaved for 3 minutes, which made them much easier to peel and cut.  Then I put the diced sweet potatoes ba

This is a keeper!!!. I have a brother who is vegetarian and we are always looking for new meal ideas to serve when he visits. We saw this and decided to try it without the meat. Very good. Can't wait to try it with meat. May also try adding some brown sugar.

This will be our new chili recipe!  We skipped the water and only used ground beef which worked fine.  We cut back a little on the cinnamon because of other reviews, but decided the recipe amount would have been fine for our tastes.

This is delicious!!! The only changes I made were to omit the onion powder (didn't have) and replaced the garlic powder with fresh pressed garlic. The chopped avocado adds even more yum - don't leave it out. I served it with rice and Chef John's Farinata. Definitely a keeper!

Outstanding. I followed the recipe but added more of each of the seasonings and used all turkey. The best chili I have ever had. I served it with yogurt, shredded cheddar cheese, chopped scallions and avocados

I made some changes: no meat and no added water. Used a whole onion, a lot of celery and 3 cans of beans; kidney, black and garbanzo. This made at least 9 servings. It seems this would be a great Weight Watchers meal! 1 point at most! (probably more like 1 point for 9 bowls, but check the labels yourself, I'm on maintenance!)

Made this for my husband and myself this week. I followed the recipe as laid out.   I must say the first day we tasted it neither of us really cared for it.   To us it tasted like there was too much cumin in it  and putting the cooked ground turkey in it so late in the cooking process did not allow the meat to absorb much of the seasoning process.  However, since there was quite a bit made we had leftovers for the next day and then some.  Tasting this chili the second day, the seasonings had had time to blend and it certainly tasted much better.  My husband was still not a fan of this dish but I will make it again if only for myself - but with a little less cumin.

Such good flavor I did the recipe as it was originally written but replaced water with chicken broth.  I personally would like a Lil more spice so I'll have to use bigger pinches and add a lil heat on the next batch

Delicious. I ended up using 6 cubes of frozen mashed sweet potato that I use for baby food instead of fresh and it was great. I love cinnamon but my husband could have done without it. I didn't tell anyone who ate it the sweet potatoes were in there and no one even noticed. I will make again.

I love sweet potatos and I love chili so this recipe with all it's great reviews had my hopes high.   The fact is, the flavors here didn't really do it for me.   Had a hard time eating it and the leftovers are just sitting.   Not enough seasoning in general, so the spices could probably be done a little more heavy handed.   And after 5 hours in the crock pot, the sweet potatoes have been completely taken over by the tomato sauce, so the flavor of those was lost in the course of the cooking process.    It's probably personal taste on whether you like this one or not since it is pretty unique.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The only change I made was to use 1 lb. of ground beef, omitting the ground turkey.  The sweet potatoes made it too sweet, my guest did not eat more than one bite.  If you make this, make a half recipe to test it out.

This was very good.  I made it as described.  Next time I think I will adjust the heat on it a little higher, add more tomatoes, and maybe more beans less meat.  Just a personal preference.  I liked the hint of cinnamon.  Made it a little unusual & different and went well with the sweet potatoes.

My husband I absolutely loved this.  I don't think it takes as long in the slow cooker as the recipe states.  I'd say at least an hour less but it was really good and very easy.  I thought the spices were spot on.  Not sure why someone thought 1/2 t of a teaspoon of cinnamon was too much?  I would highly recommend this recipe and I think you can add any veggies that you want.  I added carrots just because I had them.

This recipe is surprisingly very tasty.  I made some small changes that worked well for me.  I couldn't find stewed tomatoes with chili seasoning so I just used two cans of diced tomatoes and added a small packet of chili powder (about 3 tablespoons). Instead of black beans I used chili beans (hot) and left out the pepper sauce.  I used all Turkey because that's just my preference for meat.  However, I did brown the turkey and mixed all of the ingredients together at the same time instead of waiting five hours to add the meat.  Another reviewer suggested microwaving the sweet potatoes for a little bit in order to cut down on the cooking time and it really was helpful.  I added a whole can of corn and chicken broth to make it a little soupy. I will definitely make this again.

Family loved it!  My wife pronounced it her new favorite.   I added another 1 and a half Tbs. of chili powder.  I had no cinnamon so I added a bit of Allspice instead.  The main difference was water. I needed about 2 and a half cups to keep it from getting too thick. I will definitely make this one again!

I made this for the 1st time and it was very delicious and satisfying.  I pretty much followed the recipe except that I used canned yams (what I had on hand) and all beef.  I think this would be just as great as a vegetarian dish.  Very tasty.  I also put sour cream out as a garnish for anyone who wanted it - was a great compliment to the flavors.

I kicked it up to Texas style with a dash of German 
3 tablespoons ground red chili
1 tablespoon cumin
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle 
1/4 cup Riesling wine
Everyone loved it! The cinnamon and wine compliments the sweet potato without overwhelming the savory and warm overall flavor! Folks went for seconds!

I added a bit more garlic powder (on accident, I swear...) than a pinch, substituted turkey sausage for turkey meat (I loves a good sale), but it turned out fantastic! On my own, I would have happily eaten it as-is, but the boyfriend is a metabolic freak who needs a lot  of caloric action to be happy and I was making it for him. First I told him it was vegetarian, enjoyed the look of horror on his face, then added a little bit of goat cheese, cream cheese ( like a sliver of each, just enough to give it some creaminess) plus a bit of cheese tortellini as a base and then finally reassured him of animal protein content. It was a hit, and we will find delicious ways to use the leftovers with breakfast eggs and lunch wraps. I don't think it would be difficult to make this a delicious vegetarian dish, that sweet potato really carries it's weight. Either way. Easy to make, seriously, a lot of bang for your buck.

My husband and I love this recipe and look forward to making it. I only cook it on high for 4 hours, putting the beans and corn in at 2 hours, and the sweet potatoes were fully cooked. We are vegetarian- it is still delicious without the meat! We also add sour cream to it before serving, because well, we love sour cream!

Made this for a chili cook off. It did not win because I live in Texas and everyone likes more traditional chili. But everyone was intrigued and tried it and commented on how they thought it would be weird but was really good. Several people had multiple bowls. I think it is delicious and I admit I was skeptical too but just make it! You will not be disappointed.

I've made this probably 5 or 6 times now. It's awesome and super easy. I use just ground beef (and whatever kind of beans I have) but other than that I follow the recipe exactly. Deelish every time!

So good!  Add a touch of Agave and turn up the salt and heat for an epic meal.

I was really skeptical about this but it looked delicious and had great reviews so i decided to give it a shot. I am so happy I did! this made my whole house smell like cinnamon! I did add an extra pinch of cayenne, a pinch of minced garlic and an extra pinch of salt about an hour before it was done because i was worried about the cinnamon overpowering it. My husband hates sweet potatoe and i'm pretty sire that rven he is going to fall in love with this. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! will definitely be making it again

I was looking for a good turkey chili recipe and was happy to have found this one! The sweet potato and cinnamon added a great smell and it was very flavorful.  I used this as a guide and made a few changes just based on what ingredients I had available (cannellini beans, no corn, chicken broth instead of water). Great base recipe!

I don't know why, but I was expecting a different flavour.  Something sweeter, I suppose.  This more or less tastes like a traditional chili, and it's quite good.  My husband and I both added Caribbean-style pepper sauce to our portions, and that really made the dish amazing.  I will definitely make this again, it's easy and relatively healthy!

I replace the celery with 2 bell peppers chopped.  I do probably add a bit more than a pinch of cayenne pepper ;)  and last time I threw some chopped jalapenos in it.  Instead of beef & ground turkey I use chicken.  I have tried it with all ground turkey and no beef but felt that it was too bland.  I cooked the chicken in a skillet with a small amount of olive oil with some salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.  I threw the cooked chicken into the soup when it had a few hours left.  I like to pair this with my favorite cornbread and sometimes some sour cream.  Yummy alternative to regular ol chili. =)

REALLY good and very easy to make! Followed all directions except I browned a pound of ground beef with the onions and a clove of minced garlic (about 1/2tsp), drained the oil and then added everything into the slow cooker at the same time. Cooked on low for about 8-12hrs, stirring a couple times during that period (as other reviewers mentioned that the sweet potatoes didn’t cook all the way through). Mine turned out wonderfully and was very tasty! The cinnamon really does make the difference and you will be glad you added it. Freezing it to see how well it tastes when thawed so I will let you all know but I suspect it will be just as good :)

Delicious! I sauteed the onion and celery in olive oil, added the ground beef and turkey along with salt and pepper. When the meat was close to done I added a heaping tsp. of chopped garlic. I transferred the meat mixture to the crock pot and added the rest of the ingredients. I did add black beans w/chili seasoning, stewed tomato w/onion celery and bell pepper. The chopped tomatoes had jalapeno so I omitted the cayenne. I also left out the water. I don't think you could go too wrong with any given tomato combination. I served it with a little grated cheddar, sour cream and avocado.

Great recipe.  I doubled this recipe but omitted the cinnamon and corn due to my families dislikes.  Also because I had ground beef on hand that is what I used and fried with onion before putting in crockpot.   Very hearty, delicious comfort food.  My suggestion is to cook on low for 8 hours.  After 4 our potatoes still weren't soft so had to turn to high.

I love this recipe. It's great for someone like me who doesn't enjoy cooking but wants to make healthy meals for the family. It is easy and delicious! Plenty of left overs too. I left out the celery and ground beef. The sweet potatoes really make this recipe! I topped it with fresh cilantro and avocado.

Great recipe ! I had to substitute a few things just based on what ingredients I had on hand. I didn't have celery, corn or ground beef. I used half each red and yellow bell pepper diced and turkey only. The only other revision I made was to use fresh minced garlic not powder. Excellent flavor. Very earthy stick to your ribs type of dish. Will make again. Thanks for sharing !

It was so good! I do like tons of seasoning in my food so I added quite a bit more of all the seasonings besides the chili powder, cinnamon, and cayenne. I also used all ground turkey and no ground beef. It was amazing! I did notice the sweet potatoes never softened 100% so I might cook them for a while next time before starting the recipe. I topped it with shredded cheese, green onions and a little sour cream. Yum :)

1 lb turkey breakfast sausage, 1 medium onion, 3 ribs celery, seasoned, browned together. Add 2 medium sweet potatoes, then spices: chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper, Cajun seasoning, squirt of garlic in a tube.  Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, 16 oz can of black beans, drained and well-rinsed, and 1 cup frozen corn. (I've never seen a 12 oz can of beans?) (Used Hunt's Seasoned Diced Tomatoes in Sauce Green Chile Spices for Medium Chili, a new product to me, and they are plenty spicy...for me.) Added another cup of water as the chili was so thick I could hardly stir...probably because I'm not using the crockpot as per the recipe.  So far, so good. Looks and tastes yummy. A little spicy right now but hoping the sweet potatoes will mellow the spice. Prolly not too spicy for a normal person : ) ...

Easy weeknight meal. I had to make some changes based on what I had on hand (dice tomatoes sub for stewed tomatoes and chili beans sub for black beans). My husband doesn't like cinnamon so I only added a pinch and he could still taste it! I won't add it next time but that's just personal preference.

I made this stove top because I had ground turkey and sweet potatoes I needed to use. I cooked the turkey (whole pound didn't use any beef), onion, celery and spices for about 10 minutes or until meat fully cooked. Then added tomatoes, sauce, and water. After a few more minutes added the beans and corn to serve.

This is a family favorite. I have tried it as listed, but my family prefers it with the following changes:
1) leave out the corn (corn does not belong in chili)
2) we use all ground turkey (you can taste the seasonings more)
3) I add a couple tablespoons of canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. It adds a kick.
4) I use Vietnamese cinnamon which has a much deeper flavor. The cinnamon with the chipotle really works well together.

This recipe also freezes pretty well.

This was a big win! However, just a little bland. So, we made just a couple of mods... 1- I added diced bell peppers(orange and yellow), 2- we added half a stick of butter and 3 table spoons of Light Brown sugar(to give it a sweet and savory touch), 3- we didn't have 6 hours so we boiled the sweet potatoes for fifteen minutes, browned the meat, and cooked EVERYTHING in a roasting pan (well covered) for just 3 hours. Stirred every 20 minutes to half hour to ensure everything was properly breaking down into a sauce. It turned out fantastic. I should also note we decided to skip the beef and only used Turkey.

Loved it! We were a bit skeptical about putting sweet potatoes in chili, but it was just the right amount of sweetness. Not overpowering at all! After reading other reviews, I didn't add water and cut back a little on the cinnamon. We also left out the cayenne (but added it in the adult bowls individually).  I added some green bell pepper but totally forgot about the corn! Next time, I'll definitely add it. We had ours with sour cream, but could have passed without. Next time, I might add another kind of bean as well as topping with cheese.  I also won't forget the corn!

Made with 1 lb ground beef and cooked on the stove top by browning the beef with the sweet potatos, onion, celery and one clove of crushed garlic, drained the grease, added the spices and let them heat up, then added turkey stock in place of water along with the tomatos and beans. Added the corn after it had simmered for about an hour, then simmered for another hour, taking the lid off for the last 30 mins.  EXCELLENT chili and definitely a keeper.

This was so different and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't really need any changes. I usually top my chili with sour cream and cheese, but this one tasted weird with the sour cream, so I just top it with cheese.

This was awesome.  Substituted veggie "ground beef" as I am a vegetarian and still tasted great!

Modifications:

I didn't have enough chili powder (only had 1/3 Tblspoon), so added some pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg and ground chipotle powder in addition to the spices specified. Also lessened the cumin but increased the garlic powder and onion powder.

I also didn't have corn, so added a pink lady Apple instead (cubed). Also browned the meat with salt, pepper, pumpkin pie spice (just a dash), and onion powder plus garlic powder. I cooked everything in high for 5 hours, adding only about 1/5 cup water instead of 1/2 cup. Served with cornbread and homemade maple butter - it was fabulous. Friends and family all raved.

This was a win for my family. I will definitely be making this again. The only thing I did differently was throw the whole can of corn in instead of just the cup.

Used a can of what I thought were mild tomatoes and chiles, but was a little too spicey for us.  A dollop of sour cream on top quiets the heat nicely.

My husband loved this!  I only had ground turkey when we were snowed in, so I will try the half turkey/half ground beef next time. After adding the beans and corn, the chili was thick, so I added 11 oz. of V8 juice to stretch it a little.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was great! I got a late start do I only cooked on high for two hours then added the meats, corn, and beans and cooked an additional 2 hours.  I accidentally put in a whole teaspoon of cinnamon but it was still great.  I also used a whole pound of organic, grass fed beef and 1/2 lb turkey.

that was really good. we feel it was missing something, some kind of spice/seasoning, couldn't put our fingers on it, but it was still good. even my 11 year old who turned his nose up at it at first said i should enter it into a chili contest....guess he liked it after all.

I used all ground turkey for this recipe and thought it turned out great (albeit, a bit drier).  Really hearty and robust meal, and the sweet potato is a nice twist.  I didn't cook for as long as the recipe indicated - maybe half an hour on the stove for the vegetables and spices, and then an hour once I added the meat. Still good.

Nice having a chili that differs from the traditional chili.  Pleasantly surprised how good the sweet potatoes tasted and gave a wonderfully flavored chili.  As a side note, I used dry beans after soaking overnight and put them in the beginning. Didn't work well, they didn't cook all the way through.  I will only use canned blk beans for now on.  I only used gr beef and cooked till most of pink gone and then added at the beginning, was fine this way.

I loved this recipe and now it replaces my normal chili. I used all super lean ground beef but otherwise followed the recipe and it smells delicious, is so easy and tastes fabulous. Stores well for future meals either in fridge or freezer. Like to top w/avocados.

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! The fact that this recipe uses sweet potatoes caught my interest  since they are so good for the body. Used a pound of lean ground turkey- no beef. Browned turkey w/some of the onions (used 2 Med onions because we like lots of onions) added zucchini instead of corn. Other than those 2 changes followed the recipe exactly. My husband ate 2 large bowls of this chili and gave it 2 thumbs up  :-) .

Excellent!!!!!  The best chili I have ever made or ate!! Used all turkey and only 1 of the cans of tomatos had chili seasonings so overall it was tasty w/o being too spicy for the kids. They are normally picky but ate this.  I served green Tabasco on the side for the adults who needed more of a kick. Very Yummy!  Just be sure to start it well ahead of time.

This is a fantastic recipe--a wonderful and most nutritious "comfort food."  My two little boys enjoyed it, also, with a sprinkling of grated cheddar (to offset the heat a bit).  Thanks for a great recipe, salt&light!

This is so delish! It has become one of my favorite winter staples.  The addition of cinnamon with the sweet potatoes makes this spicy sweet perfection.  I generally use all (extra lean) beef, a whole can of drained corn and cook it stovetop, cooking the onions and celery with the beef. No complaints. A hit with the whole family.

I made this recipe. The store didn't have any tomatoes with chili seasoning, so I used chili beans that have the seasoning. Not sure if that was a problem, but both my husband and I thought this tasted strange. The sweet potatoes and cinnamon clashed with the traditional chili seasonings in the recipe. I won't make this again.

I made the recipe as directed and it turned out okay. The chopped up the sweet potatoes small and they were very tender. The chili came out soupy but that might be fixed if I had kept it on longer. Over all it was a bit too sweet and not really like chili. There was not enough heat. While I will eat the rest of what I made I probably won't make this again.

A hit with everyone. My wife loves sweet potatoes and tells me this is her favorite chili of the ones I make.  I did only put half the called for sweet potatoes. Used only ground turkey - and put everything into the crock pot at the same time.  Turned out great.

This was great. I followed it almost exactly, but didn't have chili powder so added a little paprika, a tad bit more cayenne, a little more water, and used all turkey instead of adding 1/2 beef. It was wonderful on a cold rainy day. My young college student roommate loved it. The sweet potatoes do get a bit mushy, but it still tastes great. Recommended.!!!

This is awesome!  Had ground ham in the freezer to use up so used that instead of the ground turkey/beef.  FANTASTIC!  Will be making again soon!

mmm, so good. No celery, so I opted out. Browned meat and onions. Also added some brown sugar, chicken bouillon, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a can of tomato soup to round out the flavours. Yummy!

This recipe is awesome!  I love sweet potatoes and not the rest of my does, so as I was preparing this I was cringing because it does make a large batch and what if no one else liked it?  My two boys 19 and 20 loved it and my husband did too! We prefer more juice though so I would add more tomato sauce and a larger can of corn.  I also agree with the other reviews about cutting back or eliminating the cinnamon.  It was just a little too much, which surprised me because I love cinnamon!  Will make again for sure!!

I made this tonight and didn't have stewed tomatoes with chili seasoning, so instead I used a can of rotel, a can of diced petite tomatoes and a can of chili beans in addition to the rest of the ingredients.  It was DELICIOUS!  I probably used more celery than the recipe called for, chopped really fine, because I had some leftover in the house already.  I also used 2 BIG sweet potatoes and it turned out great.  Not thin at all.  My husband ate 3 bowl of this!!

so good! and easy. It has that salty sweet thing happening and a lot of flaveor. I didnt use the beef or corn only because I am just not that into it.  It was great but I am sure it is good with it as well.

Recipe Group selection of 10/6/12.  I halved the recipe and had to make a few tweaks. What I thought was a can of black beans turned out to be red beans, so I used them and I doubt it makes too much difference.  I also did not make this in a slow cooker.  I browned my meat and sauted my onion and some fresh garlic in my cast iron Dutch oven then added everything else and brought it to a boil then put it in a 350 oven for about an hour.  I liked this and will make it again, but I will probably leave the cinnamon out or cut it back to just a pinch.  This would be really good on a cold snowy night.  Thanks salt&light.

This was absolutely amazing! The first time I did it, I didn't have any black beans, so I sort of tossed the "chili" part of it and instead added some raisins. It was really sweet (but not overly so) and decadent as a main dish, a big hit. The next time I did it with the black beans and it was also great, although we missed some of the sweetness from the time before. This will be a regular dish in our rotation.

I thought this recipe was good, however I did not read the instructions carefully and didn't realize it was a slow cooker recipe. So I made it on the stove and it was very good. I used all pork for the meat. On the side I made pilsbury crescents, really good combination.
