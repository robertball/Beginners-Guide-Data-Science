I used my own homemade taco seasoning and I upped the cilantro. I had some red peppers I needed to use so I sauteed those with some sliced onion and fresh minced garlic and threw all that in the crockpot with everything else. This is off the charts delicious. The cream cheese makes it just creamy enough without going overboard. One of the best soups I've had in a long time--nevermind it's incredibly simple to make. This recipe's a keeper.

Hubby really enjoyed this.  I used an 8 oz. block of cream cheese and substituted boneless thighs for the breasts and frozen (thawed) corn instead of canned.  Next time I will add even more cilantro. I shredded the chicken before serving. The day it was made I thought it was good, but it definitely tasted better the next day. It filled my crockpot to the brim.

Very good! Took to a potluck and EVERYONE loved it. I de-boned a cooked rotisserie chicken and added it to all the other ingredients except the cream cheese. I added 2 cups of chicken broth since the chicken was already cooked. Put it in the refridge overnight. Cook on high for 3 hours then added cream cheese which thickened it up a bit and cooked another 20 mins. It was wonderful.

Excellent stew; could also be called a chili. The only change I felt compelled to make was to add about a 1/2 cup onion; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. While putting it together, I felt that 3 cans of tomatoes were too many, but it ended up being the right amount.  I also considered not adding the cream cheese, but it gave a really nice creaminess to the stew.  Next time I will actually add less chicken - I think half will be enough.  The recipe didn't state to shred the chicken, but I did.  You need a large crock pot for this recipe!  Thanks, Mshellz2u!  I will have some yummy leftovers for awhile!

husband said "if it's easy, it's a keeper".  It was!  This coming from a guy who's not a fan of Hispanic dishes!  Yum!  Thanks!  We did take out some of the liquid and served over rice.

Fantastic!! Elected to use 3-3/4 lbs. of skinless, boneless chicken thighs rather than chicken breasts. For the diced tomatoes, used 4, 10 oz. cans of Rotel Hot Diced Tomatoes w/ Habaneros. For Taco Seasoning, used 6 tsp. of Taco Seasoning I by B. Echols from this site. We choose to make this as a soup, leaving the extra flavorful liquid (if making as a stew, reserve the liquid for use in other dishes). The addition of cream cheese is a nice twist, but this soup can easily stand on its own. The habanero peppers definitely ramped up the heat, but perfect for us. We used a 6 qt. slow cooker, and it was full to within an inch of overfilling {and we probably used at least a pound less of chicken}. Our cooking time was 4 hrs. on low, and followed by 2 hrs. on high. MSHELLZ2U, your roommate did you right, and thankfully you cleaned out your cookbook.

Very good recipe!  Followed the recipe, except for not reading that the beans needed to be drained.  Made for a good soup.  We added rice to the soup and topped with crushed Fritos.  Next time, we'll also top with some sour cream, shredded cheese, and chopped onion.  It's the kind of recipe that makes for a good starting point to add stuff to and be creative with.

I read through a lot of slow cooker stew type recipes on the site and landed on this one for a few reasons. The flavor sounded great and the recipe seemed quick to put together- boy was I right! I made only 2 changes to the recipe which was to use boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast and low fat cream cheese at the end.

This recipe really was SO easy. If you can operate a can opener you are pretty much done. After 10 hours on low the chicken essentially shred itself. The key is definitely using good quality pantry items. I used a Salsa Verde that is my absolute favorite from Trader Joes and a higher quality can of diced tomatoes which I think helped with the depth of flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

This sounds like it would be really good if you are pressed for time. I think frozen corn and using uncooked beans would be so much healthier. 
I haven't made this yet and when I do, I will come back and let you know how it turns out!

Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!  I made this recipe just as specified except I used the tomatoes with green chiles instead of just diced tomatoes and I added half of a yellow onion, diced.  For some reason, I just have to put onions in everything.  Even without them, this stew would be excellent.  I didn't have to remove any of the liquid as recommended to end up with a nice stew texture, however mine did cook in the slow cooker for nearly twelve hours.  I tasted it when I was rushing out the door after about 10 hours and was really skeptical of adding the cream cheese because it tasted so good without it, however, the cream cheese really does add a different dimension to the flavor profile.  I like that I can omit that if necessary next time I make it, as all of the other ingredients I usually have on hand.  This is a quick and easy stew and is definitely a keeper.  My husband calls it "spicy Brunswick stew" and I find that name rather fitting.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty.  I added about 2/3 cup of dry rice for the last hour and it thickened up very nice.  Nice recipe to start in the morning.

So easy to make and so flavourful.  I made some rice with lime and cilantro and also increased the cream cheese to 8 oz.for a creamier sauce and added frozen corn instead of the canned.  My family loved it!!!

Love this recipe! I found it just recently and have made it 3 times already. The only alteration I made to the original recipe is to omit the cilantro since we're not big fans of it.  We've topped it with a dollop of sour cream and hubby also has to have tortilla chips with it. I'm making it to take to a church dinner this month too...Amazing flavors!

Ah-mazing.  Used the recommendation of other reviewers to use 8oz cream cheese but you don't need it!  I used fat free (which tends to have a bit of a twang.)  I didn't mind it but my bf did.   If I made it again I would only use 4oz of cream cheese.  I think the extra cream cheese also muted some of the spices.  I like it spicy!  Was concerned about an overly salty dish with the package of taco seasoning so I used no salt tomatoes and no salt black beans.  Added extra cilantro at the end.  Such an easy dish with lots of leftovers!  I froze the leftovers but took them out within a day to eat the rest.  Try it!

Pros: Very good and filling. Relatively inexpensive and super easy to make. 

Cons: Might be a little spicy for some people- but not us!

Changes I made:
I used half the red pepper and substituted one can of tomatoes with a can of regular Rotel. I put a little meat tenderizer on the chicken. I used the whole block of cream cheese, too. Served with shredded cheddar and pepperjack cheeses and mini cornbread muffins.

Next time I make this:
I will serve with sour cream next time to help ease the heat for those that don't care for too much heat. I'll probably add another can or two of beans just because I like them.

This is amazing. We call it Mexican chicken chili. In place of the diced tomatoes, I took other reviewers suggestions and used hot rotel. I never say this but it actually was too spicy! Next time I'll stick to the regular diced tomatoes. I also used a half bag of frozen corn because that's what I had on hand. Add some sour cream, shredded cheddar, avocados & more cilantro on top and it makes an amazingly easy & delicious dinner!

Super easy meets super tasty!!  This is absolutely delicious!  I followed it as closely as possible - substituting regular salsa for green salsa (I couldn't find green salsa at the grocery store) and I make my own taco seasonings.  I use the Taco Seasonings 1 recipe from this website because it tastes 100 times better than the packaged stuff, plus I .  The chicken fell apart on it's own after cooking for 4 hours on high in the slow cooker.

I threw this together in the morning and went off to work.  Came home to my home smelling delicious with my family patiently waiting for me to add the cream cheese and serve it on up.  I used low fat cream cheese.  This recipe is awesome and everyone loved it.

This was relatively easy to make and both my husband and I like it very much.  I did make a few changes based on what I read in other reviews but, I believe, kept to the recipe for the most part.  I used 2 cans of Rotel Mild and 2 cans of Rotel Original, I added 1/2 chopped onion, I used reduced sodium beans (both types), a mild salsa verde, only 1 tsp of chili pepper, about 1/2 extra tsp of cumin (we really like cumin!)frozen corn, and 8 oz of lo fat cream cheese.  Even with those changes it was quite spicy but I added toppings of lo fat sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, cilantro, green onion, avocado, and rolled tortilla chips and this definitely reduced the spiciness to a level that we could enjoy.  My husband had seconds but couldn't eat it all as this is a very filling stew.  Tomorrow I think I will add 2 cups of lo Na chicken broth to make it a bit more soupy and possibly might add another block of lo fat cream cheese.  
2nd review: I did add 2 16 oz. cans of lo Na chicken broth instead of 2 cups to make this more soupy and also added another 8 oz block of lo fat cream cheese.  It was so delicious and was still plenty spicy.  My husband and I loved this!  He wanted more and I told him I would make another batch in two weeks because I don't want to get tired of it.

Very good chicken stew.  I cut the recipe in half, used 1 (1 lb) frozen chicken breast, 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can Rotel. I used 1 can of undrained pinto beans, 1 cup frozen corn and some chopped onions.  I substituted Neufchâtel cheese for cream cheese, using 1/2 cup.  I served it topped with Mexican cheese blend, sliced avocado and a dollop of sour cream.  Enjoyed by everyone.

I used this recipe for a chili cook-off at work and I won!  For the diced tomatoes I used three cans of original rotel.  Instead of using store bought taco seasoning I made my own (the recipe is on this site at Taco Seasoning I).  I used about 2lbs of chicken and there was no need to remove any of the liquid.  I like heat so I used a "hot" green salsa.  Since I was making this for my co-workers I did add 3/4 cup of cream cheese vs. 1/2 cup to mellow out the heat a touch.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and it was still delicious.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Excellent. I was already way into this before I realized I didn't have any green salsa.  It was wonderful without though. I'll be sure and add it next time which I'm sure will improve it.

This was sooo good. I cooked it on the stove and put in cooked chicken that I baked and then I poured in the "chicken broth" that was left over in the pan. I also never use taco seasoning anymore. I just season with cumin, chilli powder, cayenne, onion powder, garlic pepper, salt, etc. to taste. It was sooo good. I also added onions. This will be a weekly rotation. The cream cheese really kicks it up a notch!

Very tasty and easy. My SO thought that this was just so/so but I really enjoyed it so we'll call it 4 stars. I was a bit worried after putting everything in the crockpot that this was not going to have enough liquid but after cooking a while it was fine. This does REALLY fill up your crockpot! I did up the cilantro and added it at the end because it keeps it's flavor better that way. Yum, thanks for the recipe:)

This was very delicious.  I really liked the black bean and pinto bean combination.  I wasn't sure about what she meant by the ground red chile pepper, which could be cayenne, but 2 teaspoons of that would probably be way too spicy.  Instead I used 1 1/2 teas. of Chipotle Chile Powder which made it perfectly flavorful without being too spicy (though next time I may increase it).  Other reviewers were right, this fills your crockpot to the brim!  I wish I had used my larger crock for I had to leave out some of the corn (I used frozen) because it would have spilled over.  Used frozen chicken breast right out of the freezer.  First day I served with cheese and crushed chips and the second day (there's a tone here) I served over rice with a dollop of sour cream... so good both ways!

Very good recipe! I loved that you make it in the slow cooker :) We topped our soup with a spoonful of sour cream and some shredded cheddar cheese, served with some corn chips! It made a TON for just two people so I froze half of it for another dinner. Thanks for sharing!

LOVED this recipe. Reminds me of a tortilla soup. We put cheese and tortilla chips on the top, it was fantastic. We only used black beans, and used frozen corn instead. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

This was excellent.  The only thing I changed was I substituted 1 can of tomatoes with a can of Rotel tomatoes, canned corn with frozen and added a few Hatch Chillies I had in my freezer.  Will make this again and again...
Poured this over crushed tortilla's and topped with sour cream and shredded cheddar...everyone had seconds...very good!

Second time making it, based on some of the reviews, I used tomatoes with green chiles, homemade taco seasoning, the whole cream cheese block, and extra cilantro.  Very satisfied with this - it is so quick and easy and it makes a lot!

I am so glad everyone is enjoying this recipe! It's been awhile since I originally posted this. I use Rotel tomatoes mild and 1 actually use a whole block of cream cheese when I make. I know that's not for everyone, but as I have seen some of you add that also. Obviously we all try to cook health and I enjoy seeing everyone's additions and substitutions.  I wanted to say that if you want to save time- I also will buy a whole rotisserie chicken and debone and flake the meat instead of chicken breasts! Just another helpful addition to this recipe. This is a great starter and you can be super creative with it! Enjoy

I absolutely love this recipe. The flavor and colors are wonderful. It's quite spicy so I top with a little sour cream. I made mine with chicken thighs (thats what I had). I also used 1 can less tomatoes and cooked on high for 5 hours.

This recipe was outstanding! The only changes I made were that  I lowered the red pepper to 1 tsp instead of 2 because we have children and I only used 1 can of tomatoes. Let me tell you that my husband is hispanic and he raved about this meal. I would dare say this was the best meal I have made and I've cooked for a long time!

I have made this recipe multiple of times .. however, I add an extra chicken breast, an extra can of the diced tomatoes (all low-sodium), an extra can of corn (will be switching to frozen corn after this however), an extra can of bean (Low-sodium, as well, however, depending upon whether my daughter is included pinto or black beans as she is allergic to black beans), up the taco seasoning to 1.5 packages .. (plan on making my own after I run out of the packages I have on hand, although I use low-sodium). 1.5 Tablesppons of fresh cilantro and 1.5 packages (12 oz) of cream cheese. It serves 10 easily this way ... seems like the magic number over here .. would probably serve 12 if some are small children. Serve with Sour cream, green onions, tortilla chips, & greated cheese .... recipe is always requested ... that makes it a hit in my book!

This is a great, easy recipe.  I loved it so much I made another batch two days later.  I used my own homemade taco seasoning (1T.chili powder, 1t.seasoned salt, 1/2t. garlic powder, 1/4 t. cumin, dash of Tabasco, 2 T chopped pimentos -optional)upped the cilantro and added frozen mixed veggies, as that is all I had.  It was SO GOOD!  This time I added chipotle chilis to see how that comes out. It's cooking now!

This was really wonderful.  I used 2 T of Taco Seasoning I from this website (with reduced salt and pepper and pepper flakes eliminated), omitted the chile pepper and cumin and used 4 large chicken breasts.  Also used full 8 oz. brick of cream cheese and all black beans instead of a bean combination.

This has been on my want-to-try list for a long time ... Today was the day, and it did not disappoint.  I used Old el Paso extra-spicy taco seasoning and doubled the amount of ground red chile pepper (used ancho chile), so it had a little extra kick.  The chicken breasts I had were huge (almost 1 lb. each!), so I used just three and still got 10 generous servings out of this.  Also, I cut the chicken into chunks first, so the stew took only about 5 hours to cook.  Next time I'll add an onion or two and use the whole 8-oz. block of cream cheese.  But definitely still a 5-star recipe as is.

I really enjoyed the fact that this was both spicy and creamy and certainly more stew than soup.  It's not  a combination you often find with a latin-inspired flavor profile.  I loved the brightness provided by the tomatillo salsa and the pop from the corn.

Absolutely delicious. Followed recipe exactly but used two cans of diced tomatoes and two cans of Rotel. Added a whole brick (8 oz) of cream cheese about a half hour before serving. Served with two boxes of Rice-a-Roni Mexican Rice as a side and chunks of fresh Avocado as a topping. The whole family raved about it and even though it makes a lot, it was all gone by morning. Super recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I loved how easy this was to make, but it was missing something and we couldn't figure out what.  Spicier salsa?  More cumin? More Cayenne?  I used diced tomatoes with green chilis, added chopped onion, and used frozen corn instead of canned, but other than that, followed recipe exactly. We served this over brown jasmine rice, but if I make it again, will probably serve it with flour tortillas or tortilla chips.

Really good, but I have noticed lately that when a recipe calls for a quantity of chicken breasts the results can vary.  I think 2lbs would be the right amount.

Really easy to make. I have to make half at a time as the full list of ingredients won't fit in my slow cooker. And I have a pretty big slow cooker. I couldn't find green salsa so had to use red. And I couldn't find pinto beans so substituted for kidney beans. I think maybe some of these ingredients are harder to find in the UK. Made the house smell amazing.

I've made this twice now since my kids love it and it is so easy. The first time it was a bit too spicy for my heat-sensitive child, so the second time I completely omitted the red chili pepper, and she went back for seconds.  I subbed fresh diced tomatoes (that I needed to use)  for 1 of the cans of tomatoes without any issues. I do find that I like it to be a bit juicier so add in a can of chicken broth, otherwise it has a thick gravy once the cheese is added. It fills the crockpot for those nights when you have company.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, and adding the cream cheese at the end right before serving was a really nice touch that just added some extra flavour and made the dish creamy. However, 3 cans of diced tomatoes is WAY too much. 1 can is plenty. Next time, I would drain the liquid from the can of tomatoes first before adding to the crockpot. I found that with the tomato liquid, combined with the chicken broth, the liquid was on the verge of overflowing the crockpot. Aside from using 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of 3, I followed the recipe exactly, and I ended up having to remove 1/2-1 cup tomato/chicken broth liquid, so it wouldn't overflow. Aside from these minor changes, the dish turned out fantastic and full of flavour. I will be making this recipe again, but with those minor adjustments.

We loved this recipe! It is fairly spicy and really flavorful. It is so easy to make, I put it together the day before and put it in the fridge for the next morning to cook.
I did add 1 extra can of pinto beans and extra 1/2 cup corn to make it a little more chunky.

Loved this! We didn't add any cream cheese and it was still great as a thinner soup. So easy to make and so good!

Very easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it.  A lot of comments said to double the cream cheese but I personally think that would be way too creamy.  It was perfect the way it was!

I think it was my fault this turned out just ok. First, 8-10 hours would be far too long. At about six hours, I decided to add a cup of brown rice. I think this was the mistake, and I ended up with a crockpot mush! It was flavorful, but not what I wanted. I will give it another try when I want a stick to your ribs cool weather dish. However, I will cook the rice separately, leave the chicken stew a bit soupy and serve on top of the rice. Or, perhaps, just serve with sour cream and tortilla chips on top. Like others, I used a combination of chicken breasts and chicken thighs. I am not sure the cream cheese is necessary; will make that decision next time.

I made this as submitted except - I used only 1 tsp cayenne. Thank goodness, because even that was quite spicy and I ended up adding the other half of an 8oz block of cream cheese to try to calm it down a bit. I served it over rice. Very, very good.

This was awesome!! Very delicious, creamy soup  that filled my crockpot to the brim! I used only 2 cans of diced tomatoes (so it wasn't overly tomato-ey) I also added a small can of diced green chiles, and added another can of corn (because I love corn:)) I make my own taco packet seasoning. My chicken was already thawed so I halved it and put it in the bottom if the crockpot and then put everything else on top and cooked it in high for just about 3 hours and shredded the chicken and all done (definitely did not take 8 hours) top with some sour cream and voila! Awesome recipe!

This was amazing! It was so simple to make and yet so good! My guy called it a masterpiece, and I have to agree.  Had to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand, like garbonzo beans instead of pinto beans, but that is the beauty of this recipe, it is adaptable. Served it over Jasmine rice, sprinkled cheese, fresh cilantro and avocado on top.

Very tasty but I would definitely serve in corn and/or flour tortillas as opposed to over rice.  Hot sauce and guacamoli would be a plus too.  Spicier green hot sauce would be a plus too.

Delicious! I made this dish just as called for on the recipe except for only putting in 1/4 tsp of ground red chile pepper and I only had 5 pieces of chicken. Everyone in my family loved it, even my two year old neice! This recipe makes a ton of food, so leftovers all week. mmmmmm!

Loved it! I made it for me and my boyfriend tonight and it was great! I added half of a large yellow onion, a teaspoon of minced garlic, and had to replace the fresh cilantro with dried. I also used diced tomatoes with green chilies for extra heat. I topped it with low fat shredded cheddar cheese and fresh scallions.

That was wonderful! I used only 1 can of diced tomatooes, 1 can of rotel,  a bit less chicken and low sodium taco seasoning.  Fantastic!  Everyone loved this one.  Served with a dollop of sour cream, as it did have a bit of a kick.  Also, this makes a lot!  Can't wait to make it again.

Have made this numerous times, family favorite.  So easy and tasty. Have followed recipe exactly and over the years tweaked.  Will add spices vs taco seasoning, sliced or diced green chilies and jalapeños if handy.  Like to garnish dish with chopped avocado. Will make large pot for left overs as flavor just keeps getting better.  Towards end of pot will use leftovers as stuffing for enchiladas.  Thanks for great recipe!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except that I shredded the chicken at the end and then put the cream cheese in andt cooked it until it melted.  I couldn't find fresh cilantro so I used dried-I'm sure the fresh would have made it even more amazing.***Update-made a second time-added some garlic because I had it already cut-still amazing!

I made the recipe exactly as it was written and it turned out pretty acidic.  I guess I should have anticipated that with so many canned tomatoes, but anyway, it wasn't horrible...just a little too acidic for me.

I have never reviewed a recipe before but I've been making this for a while now and it is the best slow cooker recipe I've ever found. I have changed things over time depending on how many and who I'm feeding. The biggest changes I've made are using regular salsa, normally medium but easy to adjust. I also use a creole spice mix that I mix myself so I can adjust salt level. I've made this ahead, put in aluminum trays and brought to boat for weekend trips. Reheat on grill- offer up shredded cheese and serve as a chile with rice if you can. So simple, so easy, so easy to adjust! What's not to love. Thank you for this recipe, it's probably the only reason I still have my slow cooker:)

SUPER-DELICIOUS!  I cut the recipe in half, which was plenty for our family of 4, and added 1/2 brick of cream cheese without removing any cooking liquid.  It was a great, stew-like consistency.  I substituted my own spices for the taco seasoning (cumin, paprika, chile powder, coriander).  I served it over a bed of rice with diced avocados and queso cotija for topping, but it would also make a great filling for burritos!  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again--SO QUICK AND EASY!!  Thanks!

YUM!  I only adjusted one thing, due to the spice level.  I used 1/2 tsp. of cayenne (red chile pepper) and 1 1/2 tsp. chili powder, instead of all cayenne.  This recipe was DELICIOUS, and topping it with chopped avocado is a must.  We served with tortilla chips.  Definitely putting this in our dinner rotation.

This is very much like chili in flavor, probably the overabundance of tomato. Family enjoyed it. It was not for me. Followed recipe straight up as written, with exception of adding 1 chopped medium onion and cooking for 11 hours. The chicken fell apart nicely, but it didn't pick up any character from the rest of the mix.  Pretty expensive ingredient list for a mediocre chili taste. Tons of it left over and that promises to add to the disappointment for days to come since I take leftovers to work for my lunch. Bet the wife and kids won't touch it again, either...

It was very good and well-liked, but my chicken chili is such a better way to go.  I call this South American chicken chili.  Definitely serve with avocado.
