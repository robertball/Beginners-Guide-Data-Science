This is delicious. I followed the recipe as written and it's the best horseradish sauce that I have ever had. I made it to go with Christmas prime rib and the next day it was even better. In the fridge overnight it thickened up, and I'm using it as a spread for leftover prime rib sandwiches. I will use this for other sandwiches throughout the year. It would also make a great veggie dip for an appetizer platter.

I made this to serve with beef tenderloin tonight.  Sorry, didn't wait 2 hours before serving and didn't have the chives - but it was delicious and exactly what the tenderloin needed.  Definitely a keeper recipe.......

Great recipe. I have made it twice, and both times increased the amount of horseradish. HOWEVER, the amount needed depends greatly on the quality of the horseradish used. The first time i made it I tripled the amount, the second time I used a higher quality product and only added 1/2 tbs more. I let it set for three hours. Delicious

Yum! I don't like horseradish, never had horseradish on my prime rib before, but I made this sauce for my husband and sister. It turns out, this stuff is delicious! I made it a day before and I could not stop tasting it, then I smothered my prime rib with it and am now a Chef John Horseradish Sauce addict!

This stuff is so easy and perfect for my roast beef! I did, however, add about 3 times the amount of horseradish and left out the ever so controversial lemon juice.

Easy to make and excellent.  Seemed very hot when I first mixed it, but it mellowed to just right after a couple of hours in the fridge.  

I do like it much better than store-bought sauce.

This is exactly what I wanted it to taste like. The right amount of horseradish to sour cream. I didn't change a thing. When I served it with the prime rib, my guests wanted to know what restaurant I got it from. Enjoy!

My market only had one option of prepared horseradish. It was not the "EXTRA HOT" Chef John recommended.  I was too lazy to make my own so used it anyway.  Let it sit overnight in the frig and then tasted. Too mild. No kick at all. I added another 2 tbsp of horseradish and a pinch more of cayene pepper. Much better!  The next day I whipped in some Best Foods Mayo to make left over roast beef sandwiches. OMG, so good!

This recipe has the perfect balance of heat from the horseradish and cool from the sour cream. I make my own prepared horseradish from fresh root so it tends to be extremely hot! It worked perfect in this recipe. I served it with a Cabernet wine jelly so I omitted the chives but other than that the I follow the recipe exact. I also increased the recipe to 50 servings and the ratios held up. 

Great Recipe!

I really liked this, but needed to add more horseradish for my taste. It doesn't get a 5 though, because I am in love with another horseradish sauce. But this one is super easy, and uses ingredients usually around. I certainly do like it-I'm cleaning out the bowl right now with little bits of roast beef that I wouldn't have been interested in otherwise.

I followed the recipe and found it delicious.  I can't buy horseradish in any way, shape or form and have to wait until I go to Thailand.  I can buy an American brand - Morehouse.  It says Prepared Horseradish, so I hope it's what Chef J means.  I ate it with a succulent pork chop andboiled potatoes fried up.  This sauce will go with anything.

No changes...it was perfect- served with prime rib. 
We were between the “mustard based” horseradish and this creamy one- has the perfect flavor. Made it ahead of time so it could sit in the fridge.

This simple sauce was delicious with our roast beef.  It makes about 2/3 C which is the perfect amount.  I loved that is was ingredients I almost always have on hand.

You did it again!  I baked a beef brisket and used this sauce.   The only thing I changed was adding a teaspoon  of orange blossom honey and definitely let it set for awhile before using.  Thank You again Chef John.

This recipe was great! Made two whole tenderloins and needed something quick and easy with ingredients on hand.  Followed recipe exactly and refrigerated for 3 hours so sauce could thicken. Sprinkled chives on top for garnish.

Easy and quick and quite forgiving. I made your homemade horseradish as a base with no sugar and added a pinch of Keen's dry mustard the second time. Amounts can be altered as preferred. By the way it tasted better the more days it sat in the fridge.

Made this to go with our "Christmas Prime RIb" and it was delicious, had a really good kick to it.  Really quick and easy to make and followed the recipe as is.  This will be a staple with any future Prime Rib we make.

The only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars is because I modified it.  I doubled the horseradish and added about 1/2 t of lemon juice.  I couldn't find chives so I used scallions.  We loved this and I really loved this on a baked potato!

Didn't make any changes, it was my first time makeing this recipe.. I added a litte bit less Horseradish, maybe a teaspoon less.. It looks really pretty with the fresh chopped chives & a bit ''hot'' with the cayenne pepper, adjusted for taste!  Will make this EVERY YEAR for Prime Rib Dinner on Christmas Eve.!

Perfect. I put a wee bit more horseradish b/c I didn't have the "extra hot" kind. I left out the cayenne b/c hubby doesn't like it - tasted great. I garnished it with some more chives and a bit of ground mixed peppercorns.

I wanted to try a recipe without mayonnaise.. So I basically used my own fresh horseradish soaking in vinegar. I spooned out about 5 big tablespoons,and added approx 3/4 cup of sour cream,and added a few tablespoons of lemon... I  follow my own path! Lol! It was GREAT  no other ingredients needed!

Nice flavor; a little thick for my purposes (part of another recipe).  Definitely and better tasting than pre-prepared store bought.

FANTASTIC sauce! I used it on Firecracker Scallops on this site (separate review there). I used Chef John’s homemade creme fraiche from this site instead of sour cream, but all else was as written. Yum! I love me some Chef John.

I think it needs fresh grated horse radish.  This tasted more like sour cream.  Good base. Needs more horse radish.

Pretty good,  and I'll make it again.  I like it hot, so I used a little extra horseradish.  Maybe it could also use just a touch of sweetness?  I might try a little sugar or Splenda next time.

This was a really great recipe.  I make my own horseradish and I like to serve it as is and then also offer a 'creamed' version for the fainter of heart.  This one did the trick and everyone loved.
The lemon was the special touch.
Thanks!

Good Basic Sauce for Roast Beef.  I could not find the Extra Hot Horseradish, so I did deviate from the recipe by using just Hot Horseradish.  Everyone Liked the sauce, no complaints. Perhaps with the Extra Hot Horseradish the recipe will go over the top. I will make again.

I made this for my Christmas Prime Rib Roast.  It was easy and complimented my prime roast wonderfully.  Will make it again.
