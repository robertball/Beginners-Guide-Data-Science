This is a great recipe!!  I made a few minor changes and substituted the 1 cup of whole milk with evaporated milk and used sweetened condensed milk instead of the heavy cream.  This is the closest I have come to finding a recipe that tastes like my Grandma's!! Thanks!

SMOOTH & CREAMY!  This is not overly sweet.  I thought I had made it wrong because it wasn't thick like other rice puddings.  I researched Arroz con Leche and found it is "soupier" than American rice puddings.  I cooked it a little longer to thicken to my preference, and once it cooled, it was perfect.  SMOOTH & CREAMY!  Thank you crys7422 for sharing your recipe.  I learned something new tonight!

I did as one reviewer and used sweetened condensed milk to replace that 2nd cup of milk.  It was very good and made it more rich.  If you do this, remember, do not add that 1/3 cup sugar.  Try it first.

It's a nice rice pudding, but nothing spectacular. I made it for a crowd and it did not all get eaten. It's good, but not amazing.

This is a great recipe!  Very creamy!  I didn't change a thing and it thickened up just right.  My husband said it wasn't sweet enough and added more sugar but I love it as is.  As for those who say they loved this recipe but changed ingredients, you do realize don't you, that if you change an ingredient, add an ingredient or delete an ingredient then it is no longer this recipe.  Just one of my petpeeves about many of the reviews on this site.  But, enjoy this recipe as is or with alterations.  bg

I've noticed a lot of reviews stating the rice is really soup-y or watery. I've made this plenty of times and it's always pretty thick. So, I'm thinking it could be that some people are following package directions for cooking the rice and then adding the water to the cooked rice? If that is not the problem, omit the 1 cup of milk added after the sweet rice is made, which will make it more custard-like. I hope this helps!

I have made this recipe a couple of times now.  Like others when I followed it exactly it was a little too runny and not sweet enough.  Each time I "doctored" it up a bit and I've finally got it the way my gramma used to make it.  I had a happy accident and added two eggs instead of one.  Two make my two cups of Milk I added a whole can of sweetened condensed and topped it off with 2%.  I left that third cup of milk out completely.  No added sugar.  Thosone were my only changes.  It came out thicker and richer.

This recipe was very good, I did take some advise from other reviews and used evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk.  I loved this recipe as a child and remember my mother boiling her water with a few sticks of cinnamon before adding the rice and ommiting  the 1/2tsp of ground cinnamon.  Overall this is a great Arroz con Leche.  Thanks for sharing

This recipe should have included instructions to serve with a straw.  I made it to take to a pot luck and was so disappointed.  If the measurements are correct on the ingredients, then something else is wrong or omitted.  A waste of good ingredients.

This is the best I've ever had.  I substituted half Splenda in the recipe and it still came out awesome.  Although I didn't add the raisins as my wife doesn't care for raisins in her Arroz con Leche.  It's well worth the time it takes to make it.

The ingredients were good but too much made it kind of runny when its supposed to be creamy, and I even combined the right amount and didn't even use it all and it still came out runny. next time I make I will make a few small changes. only reason why it didn't get 5 stars Good recipe though.

This was a big hit at my potluck at work. I substituted 1% milk for whole milk and egg substitute for the egg and it was still great. I would try to cut down on the calories and fat further next time by using the other users suggestions as well.

This recipe is the closest thing to my grandmas arroz con leche that’s I’ve found! The only thing I changed is I added a cinnamon stick in as well! That made it taste just like my grandmas! Just a side note to everyone talking about the consistency, this is a Spanish version of rice pudding, it is not meant to be thick. It’s meant to be soupy. The consistency is exactly what it’s supposed to be!

It did not have enough water and then not enough milk when cooking.  When it was done it didn't have the custard texture and it was not sweet enough or have enough flavor.  I won't make it again.

Sweet Rice and Raisins. I added additional real vanilla extract and additional raisins (my husband likes it this way). Doing this gave pudding a bit darker color. I also add the raisins earlier into the simmering rice to plump raisins up a bit (if you do this add a bit more water when boiling rice to account for raisins to swell). Like this reciepe a great deal, easy to make. Use whole milk and cream to make it very rich and pudding like.

Next time I would cut down on sugar.  But very please with this recipe. I made it for Potluck and they were scrapping the bowl.

This was a great recipe. Like so many others before me, I also used the sweetened condensed milk and omitted the sugar and heavy cream. The second time I made this, I made a little change to the raisins to give it a little more flavor. I boiled a half of a cup of brandy and added the raisins to reconstitute them. Removed them from the brandy then mixed them into the pudding.

My family loves this recipe. I've tweaked it over all the times I've made it based on the available milks and creams in my fridge. I made it again the past weekend with leftover par boiled rice (I know I know, not the right rice but it still works) and it came out great. I usually add some cardamom and nutmeg because they add amazing flavour. Additionally I simmer it until it's slightly thick and then allow it to cool in a container with plastic wrap right on the surface to avoid the film. I use dried currants that plump up nicely in the pudding.

I was only able to take a few bites before I had to throw it away. It came out tasting like mushy rice covered in sugar.

It's good, but more bland than I expected. Only tried it warm so far, and this is my first attempt at rice pudding. The raisins tie everything else together in my opinion-- I wouldn't leave them out .

Delicious way to use up rice leftovers!  I only used 1 tsp butter, maybe a total of 1 cup whole milk, 1/4 cup sugar. Turned out thick and creamy, just sweet enough. Yum- will make again the next time I have rice sitting in my fridge.
