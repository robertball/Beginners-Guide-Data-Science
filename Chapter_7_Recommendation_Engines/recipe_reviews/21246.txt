My personal favorite is use a 2 gallon bugsprayer that was recently used with Sevin or Malathion, dump out the pesticide, put in (2) 12oz cans of frozen Lime aide, a little green food coloring, 1/2 fifth of 190 proof grain alcohol and fill with water....pump up the sprayer and inject all the fellow vanners you can find!  Bonus it makes them bug free for at least 2 weeks

We found this to be too strong for our taste, even after we diluted it by using twice the amount of non-alcholic liquids. Maybe a partial recipe could be used to spike a bowl of punch.
