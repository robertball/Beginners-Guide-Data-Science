Disappointing. A huge batch of pretty bland brownies. I wish we'd made a partial batch.

My family loved this recipe!! I only did two things differently: first I used raspberry extract instead of the vanilla extract and second I added 2/3 cup Hershey's chocolate sauce ((for added chocolaty flavor)). Next time I will use Priscilla Weaver's Hot Fudge Sauce instead of the hershey's. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Hot-Fudge-Sauce/Detail.aspx This does make a HUGE batch though, so if making it for a family of four I would suggest cutting the recipe in half. Thanks so much Amy!! These are our new favorite brownies!!! ((I will never buy store bought again!))

I "fourthed" the recipe because it sounded like so much! The batter had such a great flavor. After they baked and cooled, I dusted lightly with powdered sugar. They were awesome!

I made these in a 13 x 9 pan, baked about 55 min, and I added a squirt of Hershey's syrup (maybe 1/4 cup, maybe less) because I didn't think the batter tasted chocalatly enough, incresing the cocoa would have worked too, I just happened to have the syrup. They are very deep, over 1 1/2" thick. These are very tasty, although not as fudgy as I would expect. I just had one warm from the oven, the family will give me more info later. I have chickens and many eggs, so the idea of a recipe that uses 8 eggs is a good thing to me. Cutting the recipe in half would make nice deep dish brownies in a "brownie pan" (11x9). I will make these again!

I made a couple of adjustments - but love this recipe!  I added an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa - changed the sugar amount to 2 1/2 cups and then added 3/4 cup of splenda for baking.  I also baked it in a 9x13 pan - so almost a cakelike brownie.  Great texture and taste!

100% the greatest brownie recipe I have used yet! I skipped the icing step (trust me, they're sweet & gooey enough!) and poured on a cup of halved walnuts before popping the pan in the oven. They were amazing. Every last crumb.
