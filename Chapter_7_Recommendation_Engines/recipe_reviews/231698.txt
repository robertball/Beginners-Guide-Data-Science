A lovely quick and easy recipe with room for small changes anyone can add their own twist.
Instead of seasoning the chicken with the dry ingredients on the top I mixed them into the liquid. I had fairly thick chicken breasts so I cut them in half to make four thinner strips. I then dunked the chicken in the liquid spice mixture making sure to cover all of the chicken. I didn't have fresh lemons so I used 1/4 cup lemon juice. I think next time I would use a little more lemon juice and more of all the spices. I also didn't use bread crumbs and I'm glad I didn't because there was so much liquid they would have gotten soggy.

LOVED it!!  I tweaked it a a bit , using much less oil than Called for in the spirit of being healthy.  I put the ingredients in the bowl and whisked together and then poured it on the breasts.  I added 1 tsp of salt and pepper each and  then sprinkled abit more once it was in the dish.  even my picky daughter who almost hates chicken liked it !! Yay.!!!  Lol. Oh, and I a added  a quarter cup of lime juice instead of lemon juice.

This is an easy recipe that tastes delicious! It has a light lemon flavor and is very moist. Goes well with rice and a salad. The family loved it! :)

I just tried this for my husband and I. I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice and added lemon pepper as well and it was very bland lemon wise. Next time I will add at least a cup maybe a cup and a half of lemon juice. I omitted the bread crumbs as suggested in other reviews as there wasn't anything else to keep them from getting soggy. Also I mixed all of the ingredients together and after dipping the chicken in the mix I poured it on top of the chicken which helped to boil it and keep it from drying out.

This came out SO moist!  I used some odd spices...a tiny sprinkle of cinnamon, rubbed, and some curry (and crushed black peppercorns, of course).  Served it with steamed broccoli to which I added chopped Roma tomatoes after turning off heat and throwing on butter and a few red pepper flakes.  Nice comforting combination

4 out of 5 people in our family loved it so I gave it 4 stars. It was super easy to make, just had to make small changes due to the ingredients I had available, but nothing major. Also, didn't realize that this app adjusts the recipe to the amount of servings you add to it, and since I doubled the ingredients on my own for 8 breasts, the chicken seemed to be swimming in its cooking liquids. Next time, I will be more faithful to the original recipe and then maybe all 5 of us will love it!

We found this came out too lemony (strange since I love lemon flavour) and much too garlicky.  We also weren't keen on the texture created by the pile of breadcrumb mixture on top of the chicken.

I must have done something horribly wrong, because mine was a disaster ! Though the chicken was moist and tender, I had way too much breadcrumbs.  The only alterations I made were to cut way back on the olive oil, and use 4 smaller breast pieces in lieu of 3 halves. They came out with piles of completely dry breadcrumbs! Ugh! I felt compelled to use the full 1/2 cup requirement, as I had pre-mixed all the dry ingredients. Maybe I'll give it another shot, but I doubt it. :(

I took the advise from other reviewers and  I mixed the liquid with the spices and then put it on the chicken. I did put the bread crumbs on but they got soggy so I put some on at the near the end of cooking and I took the aluminum paper off and it crisped up. 

I would make this recipe again,  it's quick and easy and the chicken is super moist. I might add more flavour. I found the chicken to mostly taste like lemon.

I think this could be good... without the breadcrumbs. I've never had lemon chicken with breadcrumbs on top, and had my doubts, and I was correct. The amount of breadcrumbs seems off first of all - the chicken breast I used was a little smaller than average, but even still the breadcrumb mixture would have been far more than was needed unless I dumped it into the liquid as well as on top of the chicken. I ended up using about half the breadcrumbs, and they ended up soggy and unpleasant. The liquid/sauce had a good flavour and was nice on the pasta I served the chicken with, the lemon flavour was a *little* more intense than I would want for a sauce, but I don't think I'd want to reduce it or the chicken wouldn't pick up enough of it. I'll try the recipe again, but next time I think I'll remove the foil for the last 10 or 15 minutes to see if the bread crumbs get crispy, and if that doesn't work I'll leave out the breadcrumbs completely

This was very easy. Chicken was moist. Other than the water, olive oil, and lemon, you can finagle your own spices.  It was a good recipe.

Did what others said: blend all spices & liquids together; only used 1 TBSP of oil, and left out bread crumbs.  Still needed some salt after cooking.

So I took out the bread crumbs and added 1/4 cup soy sauce, and whisked the liquid together before pouring on the pork. I also salted with kosher salt  and pepper on both sides of each chop before adding the liquid. We have a hot oven so I’m cooking it less than directed.

I followed others by not using bread crumbs. I also whisked the dry with the wet ingredients, dunked chicken, then poured over. When it got to the table, my husband put honey on his pieces. When I did, it really made it sweet and tangy. Really easy to make.

I reset to 2 servings and used Lemon olive oil, still too much liquid. Next time I’ll add another breast but keep the recipe to 2 servings. I also broiled for 5 minutes after the initial cook time. Very lemony, loved it.

This lemon chicken was delicious and so easy to make.  I only had two good sized chicken breasts on hand, so I sliced them in half.  I  used 1/4 cup of pure lemon juice and mixed all spices in with the liquid ingredients.  I then dipped the chicken slices  in that mixture pouring the remaining over the chicken slices when they were in dish and then sprinkled bread crumbs on top.  It  made a great crunchy texture.  Will definitely make it again.  YUM

I used 4 thinly cut chicken breasts instead of 3 large ones and it turned out so moist and delicious. I gave it 4 stars because the proportions made it to where it was swimming in oil and lemon juice. This also made the final result way too lemony for me and greasy. I'll definitely adjust the the amounts for next time because aside from that it was super easy to make and pretty good.

This was so easy and delicious and much less labor intensive than breaded chicken breasts, but same flavor. I also mixed all the ingredients together beforehand. Served with roasted Greek potatoes and roasted broccoli. Next time I'll add Parmesan cheese for an Italian twist. A winner!

I did change the recipe (no bread crumbs, less lemon juice, more lemon pepper, no salt) so I will only take one star off, but the amount of olive oil was unnecessary. The meat has oil and baking it draws that oil out. I would have rather done a couple tablespoons than a 1/2 cup. The taste was fine, and the meat was tender, but the oil  changed the texture and distracted from those positive.

Good flavor but 45 minutes is way to long. Chicken is way to dry.  More like 30 minutes because you have to add in the carryover cooking time! Shorten the time and it will be great

I enjoyed this recipe very much especially since it is all done in one dish!  I had Italian style  bread crumbs so I used those and left off the parsley and paprika. I baked my without the foil as it was suggested and halfway through the baking I spooned some drippings on the chicken. It turned out very good. I served it with rice.

Really easy weeknight meal. Made it with fettuccine alfredo. Put it in a freezer bag with 2 tbls of garlic, 3 tbls of  lemon juice and 2 tbls of  olive oil and marinated it for 1 hour. Baked for 35 mins at 350 and broiled for 10 mins after I sprinkled with bread crumbs. Really good.

Amazing recipe! A delicious and juicy way to cook chicken breast. I did use less oil than called for, and it turned out excellent.
