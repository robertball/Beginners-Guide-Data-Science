Overall this was good. I liked the combo of fruits, making it not need too much sugar. I used a combo of frozen blueberries and diced apples in place of the goji berries. I used quick cook steel cut oats, so I cut back on the water a bit, and it only took 20 minutes to cook. I wasn't a big fan of the chia seeds in this; it made it a little too slimy for me. I think I'll add some walnuts to my next bowl to give it some crunch.
