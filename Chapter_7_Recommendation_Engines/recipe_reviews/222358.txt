I didn't want to grill these lovely mushrooms, so I doubled the sauce ingredients and smothered the tops in the sauce and baked them at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes! They were just scrumptious, a favorite with my teenagers, and they keep asking me to make more!

I made this recipe tonight for dinner, and my wife loved it.  I wish that the flavor of the dijon came through a little bit more - but it was so tasty and grilled perfectly

Flavor-wise the recipe is spot on.  Time wise it is WAY off and hence the lower rating for this recipe and mine burned badly in 5 minutes. I should have known better because medium high heat on my grill is very hot, so know your grill.  Will try again on a much lower heat because the fourth of one mushroom that I saved was very tasty.

Excellent! Even our non-vegetarian family loved it. Great recipe for vegans, too. We melted some provolone on top for the meat-eaters. Everyone loved the marinade.

So easy and delicious! I wouldn’t change a thing! I couldn’t grill because it was pouring so I baked for 20 minutes at 400 as another reviewer suggested. They were so good! We didn’t even eat them with buns. My new favorite portobello dish!

Delicious ! May marinate mushrooms a bit longer for additional flavor. Cooked in the oven at 400 degrees for twenty minutes. Served with fresh red onion slices, lettuce and provolone cheese. Will definitely have again. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

My FAVORITE Portobello Burger on this website.  It's even better than the Portobello Mushroom Burger recipe; my favorite for two years!!  The Worcestershire sauce is not an optional ingredient and I used French's Dijon mustard with Chardonnay.  After removing the center stem, I poured the marinade on two mushrooms, put in a gallon Ziploc bag and let it refrigerate overnight.  Cooked on the grill, 3 minutes on each side.  Everyone thought the Worcestershire sauce and Dijon added more taste and was less vinegary than the Portobello Mushroom Burger recipe.

I didn't think this recipe had as much flavor as I was hoping for. My husband, a meat lover, was impressed though. I will probably try it again. Using a dense bread is best (i.e. hoagie bun) because the juices soak into the bread quite a bit.

This is my favorite go-to healthy recipe!  I started making this last summer on the grill and moved it in to the broiler over the winter.  Timing is all going to depend on your mushrooms, though.  The thicker they are, the longer they take to cook, but that's a given.  If you aren't keeping a close eye on them you can end up with charred mushrooms.  I recommend going by the suggested times in the recipe and flipping again and cooking for 3 min per side, if they still aren't tender in the center.

Awesome! I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.  Worcestershire is a must.  Topped with grilled red onions and used spicy ranch dressing instead of ketchup / mustard.  DE-lish!

Enjoyed these as written, but enjoyed them more with soy sauce added to the sauce mixture.  Next time would definitely try to roasted red pepper/goat cheese suggestion!

Wonderful flavor and texture. I'm a die hard burger girl and was prepared to hate this. One bite and I was a complete convert! Followed recipe exactly, but brushed them with marinade 2 hrs before. Used hamburger thins rather than rolls, and topped them with roasted red peppers and Tex-Mex cheese.

i made this for bf's daughter as a vegan alternative for the turkey burgers i made for bf and myself.. i broiled instead of grilling these.. 2 1/2 min's, flipped, then for another 3 min's and they were money.. bf's daughter said she really liked them.. she ate two when she said she was only going to have one.. i only made a couple of changes:  left out the worcestershire and subbed garlic salt for the fresh garlic and salt.. this is such an easy go-to for mushroom burgers in future.. ty for the recipe

Totally 5 stars, but could be even more.  I did exactly as recipe was written.  Used my panini grill and they are perfect.  Was very careful and stood at the grill b/c they can get done quickly.  Mine were juicy and scrumptious.   Two confirmed male meat lovers just raved.  Go for it.

This is one of those recipes that, if I could give it 10 stars, I would.  The first 5 for the recipe as printed, with the portabella mushrooms.  The next 5 for the marinade/dressing.  
I first followed the recipe as written, except that I baked the mushrooms as another reviewer suggested: 400 degrees, about 15 minutes.  They were wonderful; I can only imagine how good they would be grilled.  Then I used the dressing on a spinach/tomato salad, Equally wonderful.  Then I modified it a bit:  used stone ground mustard, added about 2 tablespoons of finely grated parmesan cheese, and used THAT on the mushrooms. Again, fantastic.
It's just the right combination of oil/vinegar/mustard to form a lovely consistency and balance of flavors. Even though the worchestershire  sauce is labeled as "optional", I really think it adds a complexity of flavor. All in all a great recipe. Definitely saved...

I've never had a Portabello Mushroom before and wasn't sure what to expect.  I have to say, Wonderful!  I loved it.  It really tasted like a burger.  The seasoning was great.  I will say I didn't grill but pan fried.  After the mushroom was cooked I put it on the bun with a couple of slices of mozzarella and used spinach leaves instead of lettuce with a little mayo.  Left off the ketchup and mustard as not to take away the taste of the burger.  Excellent, the cheese and spinach went perfect with the mushroom!

I didn't make any changes and added the optional Worcestershire sauce.  I made 2, one for now and one for later but somehow, the second burger ended up in my mouth well ahead of schedule.  I'm eating them now and had to stop to write this review.  Thanks a bunch Kerri!!!

I don't cook portobello mushrooms often, but this recipe makes me want to change that! Marinated for those 10 minutes really brings an awesome flavor. I used my convectional oven on medium and cooked them about 8 minutes and they were perfect. Would give 5 stars, no questions asked. Changed nothing!

I didn’t have Worcestershire sauce in the house, so made it without it. Delicious! I liked it better than a beef burger! Most of the family agreed, too. Will marinate longer next time as the thickest part of the portobello, by the stem, did not have as much flavor. So excited to have a healthier burger night!

The biggest change I made was that I didn't have mustard, so I used dark miso paste instead. I included the worcestershire, garlic powder (instead of fresh), onion powder and oregano. I brushed the mushrooms with the marinade about an hour before grilling, then again about 15 minutes before grilling. That mushroom was incredible!

We are new to eating vegetarian and my husband loved this. We used a whole wheat bun.

This was AMAZING!!!  My hubby passed up a cheeseburger at work today, so I made this for him and he LOVED it.  He said it totally satisfied the craving that he was having since turning the earlier beef burger down.  I will definitely be making this again!!!

Love these, even for us meat eaters! My husband now just loves to marinate the mushrooms, grill them and eat them as a side.
