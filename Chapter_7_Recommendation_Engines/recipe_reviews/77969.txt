I served this for our Thanksgiving dessert.  It was great.  Tastes just like pumpkiin pie without the crust.  Since I'm not good at pumpkin pie crusts (usually soggy)and I like the filling best anyway, it was a prefect dessert.  With fat free whipped topping, nobody missed the ususal pie.

I enjoyed the taste of this dessert...and glad that it is "legal" on South Beach.  However, it took longer to cook than the recipe states.  I saw that someone else had the same experience, so I had increased the oven temp to 325 and it still took longer.  Just keep testing with a knife every few minutes after the stated cook time.

Creates a bland dish that is not a souffle.  Cooking temp is too low and time is too long.  The result will be part custard, part semi-risen souffle.

Awesome...my husband's favorite dessert. We've been on the South Beach diet for almost a year now. I've lost 110lbs and he's lost 50. The dessert is the best.
