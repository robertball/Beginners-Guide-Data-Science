Not bad for being a 'shortcut' style. I added some minced garlic for extra flavor but overall this is a pretty good recipe when your in a hurry. Nice job!

It is a great starting point, but with 3 teenage boys had to double recipe. I used zesty italian dressing instead of vegetable oil (gives meat more flavor).  I also added extra veggies (corn, peas, petite diced tomatoes, and green beans), because my boys love veggies! next itme I'll have to triple the recipe, because they ate what I planned on taking for lunch.

Good stuff but I would also double the recipe. Also, for those who don't enjoy the sweetness that the tomato soup gives then just use tomato base mixed with water instead and boil so it thickens. You can also add whatever veggies you like (they don't have to be frozen)! I Added celery to the mix and turned out great! Otherwise, tastes as good as chunky! Hubby approved!
