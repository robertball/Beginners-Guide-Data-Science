I usually only try recipes that have high ratings but after having a pumpkin scone at the local bakery I looked for a recipe that sounded like the one  I had. No one had rated this one yet so I took a chance. This was absolutely amazing! Possible better than the bakery. I didn't have half and half but milk seemed to work fine. Half of the batch I made just like the recipe and the other half I added chocolate chips to... both were great! I make my own fresh pumpkin and it tastes so much better than canned. I can't wait to make more and share them with family!

We all really enjoyed this recipe, with two changes: less sugar and no topping. "Coffee Shop" scones are much too sweet for me; I knew this before trying the recipe so changed it accordingly. I've made it twice now, and both times the dough has been really, really wet. I added just enough flour to keep my hands from sticking, so it was still pretty wet going into the oven. But, man, do they come out delicious and with a great, biscuit-y texture.

Delicious. Not grey like the picture. I subbed a cup of whole wheat flour and added chocolate chips and almonds to the second batch. I used the food processor for this whole recipe. and FYI, 3/4 c pumpkin is half of a 15 oz can so a double batch is easy. A keeper recipe for sure.

This recipe was delicious!! Just like the pumpkin scones you'd find at Starbucks. I baked for 10 minutes. I followed the recipe with two exceptions:
 
1. I didn't have any shortening so I used 6 tbsp butter. To offset this change, since sometimes my baked goods spread or are flat when using all butter, I added about 1/4 cup flour. It turned out fantastic and I don't think made any difference.

2. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract to the wet ingredients. 

I had some leftover cinnamon icing (1 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp milk or to preferred consistency) I drizzled on top while it was still warm. So yummy!! This will be my go-to fall recipe!

I made this with pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon etc..and used almost a tablespoonful. I didn't want to waste my leftover canned pumpkin so I added the rest which was closer to a whole cup total. Used a scone pan I was wanting to try so I greased it with butter and baked for  about 25 mins at 400 degrees.  Made 1/2 the glaze and they were fabulous! Great recipe!

Came out fantastic, only regret was not making a second batch. Moist, delicious with just a touch of butter served warm were gone in no time. Would recommend to anyone, good level of spice but not out of control

This was an awesome recipe!  So the things that I did or did not do are:  (1)  I added 1-cup of sugar [not just 3/4C; (2) I used a rounded tablespoon of cinnamon [not just 1tsp]; (3) I used 6 tbls of butter and skipped the shortening; and (4) I used a healthy cup of pumpkin [not just 3/4C.  I added mini choc chips (about 1 cup) and baked on 425 for for 12 minutes.  They came out perfect!  Because I added choc chips, I also skipped doing the glaze.  Highly recommend!

This was easy to make and turned out delicious! Will make again. My changes were: I used 6 Tbsp butter, no shortening. Patted the dough into a circle shape and cut the dough into pie shape wedges, keeping the round shape while baking Baked for 15 minutes. For the glaze, I didn’t have pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon, nutmeg, dash of cloves.

This is the second pumpkin scone recipe I've tried since I wasn't impressed with the first recipe. It was a hit because my husband is having it for breakfast and his dessert after lunch and my son likes it as well. I'm an experienced baker and this is easy to follow. I will add I had to incorporate the last bit of dry ingredients in the dough by hand and knead about 3 times (don't overwork it however) and I rolled to about 3/4 inch thickness. The glaze is what ups the yum factor for my guys. I used only a generous 1/4 tsp of cinnamon but am thinking I might try maple syrup as an addition next time. This is a keeper

Followed the recipe exactly as written and these were fantastic. I did use my food processor to mix dry ingredients with fat. The second batch I added cinnamon chips. I have also added mini chocolate chips. These always turn out perfectly.

I wouldn't say these taste like the Big Chain Coffee Shop scones, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  They're moister, and taste more of pumpkin (I find BCCS version to be too clove-y).  I did find that the dough is ridiculously wet--cutting it into wedges was near-impossible, and transferring it to the baking sheet laughable.  I ended up scooping up a hunk of dough with a pie server, flipping it onto the baking sheet, and then shaping it with my fingers.  However, this may be because I used home-roasted  pumpkin that wasn't as well drained as it ought to have been.   I also did a double-batch of glaze, drizzling the first batch on while the scones were hot, and then after they had cooled adding a plain vanilla on top of the first.  All in all, this is a quick and tasty scone, even if it's not BCCS :-)

I started these before I realized I didn't have any eggs, so I just added some extra cream and they turned out perfect.  I did have to bake them for a total of 20 minutes at 425, but my oven tends to be a bit slow.  These garnered great reviews and I will absolutely make again, they were so quick and easy and yummy.

Made as directed but baked them approximately 20-25 minutes so wouldn’t be so moist. They are delicious.

These are great scones--everyone loved them. I will be making these often when "pumpkin spice season" rolls around. I used my fingers to cut it the butter and lard (I do not use shortening to avoid hydrogenated oils) because I think I obtain better results than with a pastry cutter or knives. If you really enjoy the spice flavor try using rounded instead of level measuring spoons of spices. Enjoy!

These are delicious and so worth the time and ingredients! I didn't have nutmeg so used pumpkin spice. We also don't have shortening so I used coconut oil and just milk for the half and half. Keeper recipe!!!

I followed the directions exactly.  The dough was very wet & my icing did not look like the picture and was very runny.  I think I would use more pumpkin as for me they did not have enough pumpkin flavor.

No changes to this wonderful recipe.  I had just about given up on making Pumpkin Scones until I read the reviews for these.  A flash to make using a food processor and just a few pulses.  Thanks, so much, for sharing your recipe.

Great recipe.  I did use 3/4 c whole wheat flour in place of part of the white, but for the most part, I followed the recipe.  I am a huge fan of browned butter in combination with pumpkin though, so I used a browned butter glaze instead of the glaze given here. This one is definitely a keeper.

Really top notch recipe.  I had run out of cloves so ended up using the cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and then added two tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the batter.  YUM!  I received rave reviews from my coworkers.  My son even fell in love with them after turning his nose up on anything pumpkin previously.  :)   Best scones ever!

I made these yesterday and they turned out perfectly.  I subbed out the spices for 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (being lazy).

Easy to make and so yummy. I reduced the sugar a bit and added an extra 1/4 cup of pumpkin because I didn't want to waste it. They were moist and not too sweet. I brought them to work and had rave reviews from my co-workers. I will make these again.

I have made many batches of scones. This recipe is the very best ever. I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup all the spices each a bit more than was called for. The glaze was perfect. I topped each scone with homemade Devonshire cream with a couple tablespoons of my homemade red plum jam on top of the cream. Delicious is hardly good enough to sum up this recipe. YUM!

Really delicious, even without the icing (but the icing is a nice addition!). Would certainly make these again. I did decrease the sugar to only 1/2 cup and they turned out great!

I followed the recipe to a 'T' except I forgot the shortening! ?? They were still really good, but probably would have been be more moist with the shortening. I won't forget the next time ?? The only not great thing about this is the icing. I feel it is too runny. I ended up using store bought cream cheese frosting I had and added the pumpkin spice and ground cinnamon to it. I just softened the icing up in the microwave for 20 seconds at 30%power and it was perfect. The frosting set up nicely. I plan on playi g around with a homemade icing with the powdered sugar, I just didn't have time.

These scones taste EXACTLY like the ones at Starbucks. But they're fresh out of my own oven and now I have a dozen instead of 1. Delicious, perfect texture, and so easy to make. Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

These are amazing!  I used my homemade pumpkin puree after straining it through cheesecloth.  I will definitely make these again.
The photo makes them look a bit gray in color.  They are  a lovely pumpkin color.  Photo has been updated.  I am making them again!
