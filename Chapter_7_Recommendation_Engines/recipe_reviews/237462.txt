This was the first time I made salsa. I made some adjustments by adding red peppers and seasonings, and omitting the jalapeño peppers. I mixed it together in a food processor. Delicious!!

This is just the recipe I was looking for. I wanted all fresh ingredients and I wanted it to taste as closely as possible like the salsa from a Mexican restaurant I used to frequent many years ago.  I think softening the onions is key in this recipe. I was a little concerned that it might be hot with that many jalapeños, so I used the smallest ones I could find.  Not to worry!  I ended up adding 3 more and the heat was perfect.  I also doubled the salt.  PERFECT!

this is a great salsa. you can adjust the heat by the peppers. stealing from another recipe I added 1.5 tbls brown sugar. I like a little sweet with my heat!

Yummy!  I added corn and black beans and I did not peal the tomatoes.  I diced some smaller chunks and some a bit larger.    It is good I will make it again.

Lovely salsa to hot for my taste buds but my hubby and friends just love it.. I make a similar milder one for myself and I added a dash of 1/4 tsp  instead of the heat.. Little extra flavour without the heat.. Oh love the tip about the onions most never say to do that.. I didn't  understand the thing about the cilantro so I didn't do it.. Tasted great, the question still remains could it taste better if I do that.....

Salsa is always good, and this is no exception.  I ran out of tomatoes so I use this in my grilled cheese sandwich instead.  It makes a great addition to a grilled cheese sandwich too.
