The cake portion of this was very good, moist and with a light chocolate flavor.  I would not call it fudgy - the flavor reminds me more of red velvet cake than of a traditional chocolate cake.  I used Dr. Pepper, and cut the amount of butter by half; otherwise made as written.  (Don't use diet soda - the artificial sweetener is not heat stable!)  I did not care for the topping though (which is more of a glaze, not a frosting) - it was WAY too sweet.  I made a 9x9 cake and 12 cupcakes; the cake got the topping and the cupcakes were frosted with a "flour icing" recipe, which was much less sweet and complemented the cake better.  All in all, pretty good recipe.

Unbelievable!!  I have had this cake before and wanted to find the recipe.  I'm sooooo glad I did.  The cake is yummy moist and the marshmellows add such a great consistency.  This one's a keeper!!

This cake reminds me a lot of Texas Sheet Cake...I think the only true difference is that this one adds coca-cola & marshmallows. I used Saco powdered buttermilk as I only rarely use buttermilk. I just added a couple of tbp. in w/ the dry ingredients & added a 1/2 cup of water when I added the eggs. I didn't much care for the frosting until I had it on the cake & then it was superb. Other than using the Saco buttermilk blend, I made no changes to this recipe. It's a keeper as is!

Fantastic cake. Not your same old same old chocolate cake at all. This was rich, fudgy, and delicious. This was moist and chocolatey. The cake was really good, but the icing was really fudgy and even sweeter. I didn't have nuts so I proceeded without them. This reminded me of Texas Sheet cake. My husband called it brownie cake and had 2 pieces. I added just a pinch of salt to the icing as my butter was unsalted. I didn't have buttermilk so I used the sweet milk/vinegar method to make a substitute. All I had was a British malt vinegar, but it worked and the flavor was not affected. I had to bake this just a few minutes longer as the center was still jiggly at 35 minutes. I will make this again, it was really easy and tasty and was just as I remembered from my youth. Thanks for the great recipe!

Easy recipe, no changes or substitutions baked for 30 minutes.  There is enough chocolate for my taste.  The cake is moist and the icing is really yummy, together they are awesome.  Will make again.

Fudgey and delicious!  I cut the butter a couple tablespoons for the cake and frosting.  I didn't use walnuts, used a cup less powdered sugar and poked holes in the cake for the frosting to run in.  Moist!  I used the new black cherry coke and I tasted a very subtle hint of it overall.  It was a fun cake.  Presentation isn't perfect because of the fragile moist nature but once you taste it....it's a sure keeper.

This was pretty good - I ended up leaving out the marshmallows, as I did not have enough, but the cake was still very sweet and moist.  I baked it in a bundt pan and it held up quite well - just needed an extra 10 minutes baking time.  It was not as chocolatey as I was expecting, but then again I had never had coca cola cake before so maybe that's how it was supposed to be.  Not my favorite, but glad I tried it!

This is very similar in flavor to texas sheet cake. My marshmallows floated to the top during baking. Not very pretty. Maybe a step was left out to heat the marshmallows through and let melt before pouring into pan.

This was more a sticky mess of pudding-y goo than a cake.  It was far too sweet.

This was okay, but not the recipe I was looking for.  I followed it exactly.  When you cut a slice, the top (close to the frosting) was fudgy-like, and the bottom was more cake like.  I think this has to do with pouring the warm frosting on the cake before it cools.  Also, the frosting was very sweet.  I would have preferred more cola-cocoa flavor and less sugar.  The sweetness overpowered it.  I had this cake many years ago and it was not this sweet.  I will look for another recipe but I may keep this and just tweak it.  As is, 3 stars and still very edible (especially if you like it really sweet).

This was surprisingly good.  It was quite moist and almost more like a brownie than cake.

Robin~Thanks so much for the great recipe.  My daughter wanted something for the County Fair that reflected her personality and coke, chocolate and marshmallows fit the bill.  It was an easy recipe for her to follow (she's 10) and she won a blue ribbon.  Thanks again.

This recipe is so so.  I love coke and cake I thought it would be perfect.  But it wasn't because of the mini marshmallows.  It was just so so.  I had the same problem with the marshmallows floated on top and not a pretty sight.   I will make this recipe, but the next time I will try it with marshmallow fluff.  Instead of the nuts can you substitute with flaked coconuts.  Respectfully sylvia

This is a recipe my mom made since the 60’s.  It’s everyone’s favorite in our family.  It freezes well too.  We use pecans instead of walnuts.  And since my kids don’t like nuts, I just lightly spread and press 1/2 c chopped pecans on top of half of the cake immediately after icing it while the icing is still warm.

This is pretty tasty.   I baked it for an exra ten minutes though and it was still pretty gooey.  My marshmallows all floated to the top, too.  Perhaps because they were old?  I'll try this again with a longer baking time and fresher marshmallows.

This cake is great... but, be forewarned, when making the frosting,  you must add the liquid to the powdered sugar - not the other way around as stated in this recipe  - or it will form clumps and destroy your cake!  I guess this is really cooking 101, but I thought the hot liquid would melt the sugar - it didn't!

Followed recipe exactly and it was SO GOOD. My boys and husband (and MYSELF) had it gone in no time. The icing is like chocolate fudge instead of just icing. Plan on making another really soon. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe (almost exactly) has been in my family for decades. The cake part is wonderful, but the the topping is waaaay too sweet. My family won't eat it. I would love to find another topping/frosting that goes well with this.

I thought it was very average. I found it to be sort of bland, the only real flavor being "sweet." It wasn't horrible, but I probably won't make it again.

It definately turned out better than I thought, was a little to sweet, would be good with vanilla icecream.

Good, but I'd go for something moister and with some more variety in flavor.

The cake part of this recipe was delicious. It was very moist and cooked very well in my "too-hot" oven. It made a great presentation, even in a plain pan. My only complaint is that the icing was a little sweet, and too thin. The powdered sugar also clumped together and took about 10 minutes to mix (on low heat with the other ingredients to get it to blend better). Other than that, this recipe is still a five-star keeper!

Everyone loved this cake! I didn't use walnuts. My fiancé doesn't like sweets or chocolate and he devoured a piece of cake with vanilla ice cream. Took some to work and everyone said it was great! Thanks for the great recipe.

I lost my recipe for this and was so glad to find this one! The cake turned out just like my old recipe - moist, chocolatey and delicious!
