The only change was a 4 oz can of green chilies into the  corn bread. Didn't add much that I could tell .Didn't hurt it either. I will never add the honey again. It was way too sweet for my taste. I may just take corn tortillas and layer them several deep in the dish and then add the meat/bean mix. I might try adding some cheese to the meat mix too,  basically it was good ,just needs tweaking in my opinion.

I will definitely make this again. I left the honey out of the corn bread as Jiffy mix is already plenty sweet. I also used a whole can of black beans rather than half. The result was delicious and very filling.

Only made 2 changes due to diet. Used ground turkey and gluten-free cornbread mix. But other than that followed exactly and it was amazing. Topped it with shredded lettuce and sour cream.  Will make this again at husbands request. Thank you for the recipe

We loved it!  I recommend keeping the honey in the recipe.  It actually helps the cornbread get a fine, crispy edge that is delicious.  The cornbread is already sweet but adding the honey doesn’t really add any more sweetness and is worth the added texture. The only thing I changed was I added a little more heat. I chopped a few canned jalapeños and added them to the meat mixture. Yum!

This is a nice thing to do with left over taco meat. I've made it a couple times now and it goes over really well. This last time I was out of tortilla chips, so to substitute for that I brushed a couple corn tortillas with butter, cut them into strips, and sprinkled them over the cheese. Definitely plan to keep making this!

This was really good! I went with the suggestions and did not include the honey, and it was plenty sweet.

This was pretty good and my entire family liked it. I used homemade taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning I) and omitted the honey and corn oil. I used a sweet gf cornbread mix and the honey was unnecessary and there was no need for the oil. I did use corn in my cornbread layer. I will be making this again.

The corn bread was too sweet and I didn't even add the honey. I found it very unappealing, but my husband and daughter LOVED it. He even had seconds which he normally does not do. He is more of a dessert person. I added a half can of chili beans to the filling and I added the optional corn to the corn bread. I will make it again because the family liked it, but I may add some chopped jalapeno to the corn bread mix to cut some of the sweetness. I served with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and additional salsa.

This is delicious.  I made as written except I didn't have corn chips.  Do add the honey as it adds a delicious component without making it too sweet.

Not bad...made it per the recipe (I had all ingredients as listed and didn't substitute anything...omitted the honey because the Jiffy cornbread mix is already sweet--glad I did, otherwise, it would've been mega sweet and I might've only given this a two-star rating) although I thought it was a close to being  dry.  I rinsed and drained the beans...I thnk the next time I'll try not rinsing or draining the beans).

Loved the taste but it was a little dry.  Wondering how to add a little more moisture with drowning the dish.  Any suggestions?
