Great recipe!
Easy to make and tasted good.
I used frozen cod and i took about 25 minutes to cook though! So if you are using frozen fish I'd suggest defrosting it first.

Good recipe as is but I followed another review and added more spice.  Would be a 5 with the added spice.  Included 1 clove finely chopped garlic to the veggies in the pan and seasoned the fish with dry mustard, paprika and cayenne before cooking.  Was amazing over rice.  Not too spicey, just a nice flavour to the sole fillets.  Will definitley make again.

very good,but I would recommend starting off with some margarine spread (I use Smart Balance), add onions, garlic, carrots, and broccoli ( i did not have celery) then after five minutes, add 1/2 cup of water, a bullion cube, and a cup of wine (sounds crazy but it really adds flavor). Then after five minutes, I added some fish (cod) and cream of mushroom soup. I let that simmer for over an hour to cook down and served over brown seasoned rice. Never had more praise about fish.

Excellent recipe. It was very quick and easy to make. I made the recipe exactly as instructed. I will be using this again but will try with chicken or beef instead of fish.

This was very good, and the vegetables cut like matchsticks made the dish very pretty.  I would sugest using more veggies than the recipe calls for, they were the best part.  I also cooked them a little longer, because I like my veggies more well done than many people.

Super super delicious. I chopped the carrots and celery instead of cutting them into matchsticks. I also seasoned the fish with ground mustard and paprika & chili powder to give it a kick. Truly amazing.

This was just okay.  I am not a big fish person and this dish did not really satisfy me.  Easy to make however.

Love this!  The only change I made was I used all white wine instead of wine and water.  It added a little more flavor.

Pretty good, and very easy. We'll probably make it again, but not every week. It's a nice, quick meal for fish night.
