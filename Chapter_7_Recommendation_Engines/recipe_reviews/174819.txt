This was really fun to make & decorate. I only made one change. I used green sprinkles (the crystals kind) to make the watermelon stripes on the sides instead of using jelly beans. It looked just like someone cut a watermelon in half.

I made this cake for work one day at the end of summer.  I skipped the jelly beans, but followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  It turned out great, people didn't want to cut it because they said it was too pretty.  I spent much time perfectly placing the chocolate chips to look like seed.  Thanks for sharing.

Looks really good, but way to sweet.
