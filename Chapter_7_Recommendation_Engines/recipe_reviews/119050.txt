This is a great recipe, and I have made this twice before, with the following changes: I quarter 4 medium sized sweet onions, about 8-10 small potatoes, and add a 1 lb bag of baby carrots.  Then I pour the sauce over the whole thing and bake in a covered roasting pan for about 90 minutes.  It is spectacular and gets rave reviews!

The sauce for this recipe is great!  Since I like a lot of spice, I doubled the dry rub recipe and it was still okay.  I took the advice of others and used a little less ketchup (about 3/4 C) and I'm glad I did.  I didn't quite have a full cup of Apple jelly so I put in about a tablespoon of apple juice to supplement the flavor which didn't really affect the recipe.  I overcooked the roast because I used a timer and went the full 1 1/2 hrs; after that time, the roast was about 180 but I let it sit for the full 15 minutes so it didn't dry out too bad.  Kids loved it and I will make again!

WOW!  Really?  Who would of thought that this sauce would be so good!  My hubby and kids really liked it.  My hubby compared it to an asian sweet and sour sauce.  he wants me to make some asian food with the rest of this sauce.  I ALWAYS double my sauce in any recipe I do but his one you for sure don't need to!  TIP ON COOKING PORK ROAST :  You really should never depend on time when cooking a pork roast as there are too many variables and more likely then not it will come out overcooked and dry.  If you don't have a meat therm. it is well worth the money to buy one.  Ever since I bought mine I have NEVER overcooked a port roast. They always come out moist and perfect!!! I always pull my pork roast out at 155 cus it will continue to cook a little after you pull it out of the oven....  There is nothing worse then having a great recipe and having the meat come out dry and tough...I will for sure make this again!!

This was AHHHmazing!  Followed the recipe (reducing the ketchup just a tad) brushed some sauce on the pork, wrapped it in bacon, then poured the rest of the sauce over it and baked it. WOW! Great recipe!!!

This was really wonderful!  The only thing I did differently was to decrease the ketchup to 3/4 of a cup as others suggested.  Will definitely make this again, very good!

yum! we are not big pork fans but my husband won a pork roast at a meat raffle so I thought I'd give this a whirl and I'm glad i did! I used a little less ketchup, I overcooked the roast and glaze, didn't bother to mix in pan drippings, but it still tasted great! I might have to buy a pork roast just to make this again! its also very easy which is important w/a baby in the house, not quite a one handed operation but pretty close! served w/au gratin potatoes from a box and a can of green beans.. better than i expected!

Excellent.  This is definitely worth keeping in my recipe box.  I made this for friends and they all enjoyed it very much.  The heat and sweet really went well with the pork.

Definitely one of the best pork roast recipes I have ever tried.  The entire family loved the sauce (I followed the recipe mostly to the "t," except I added a bit more chili powder.  Also, the apple preserves that I used had apple chunks, which added a burst of flavor and a little texture.  Served with white rice and vegetables...certainly a keeper!!

This roast was awesome!  The flavor of the sauce was so tasty.  The ingredients sounded interesting so I thought I would try it.  Per other reviewers, I also used 3/4 cup of ketchup.  My roast was only 2 1/2 lbs, so I used a meat thermometer to tell when it was done.  It reached around 160 degrees and I took it out of the oven and let it sit for 15 mins.  Will definitely make again.

Did not have Chili powder, garlic salt or apple jelly. Decreased Chili powder by 1/2 and replaced with red pepper Replaced garlic salt with powder and real minced garlic Replaced apple jelly with apricot  jam. My son loved the sauce (prefer brown gravy).  The cook time not long enough, it was not fully cooked in the middle and it was not fork tender.

Really good! I used apricot preserves instead of apple jelly (couldn't find it), and it made a great sweet & sour sauce. Yum! My husband loved it.

scott gave this a 5 star, I don't care for Pork roasts so I gave it a 2.5.  As far as roasts go though it was extremely tender and cooked perfectly.

Yummy!  This recipe was fantastic!  The whole family loved it, including my picky 5 year old.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I couldn't find any apple jelly at my local grocery store, so I substitued apple butter.  It was fantastic!!

I thought it was O K, but perhaps I should have read other reviews before I made the sauce, and reduced the ketchup.  I like ketchup, but the flavor was a bit overwhelming for my taste.

Wonderful. Made this with a 2 pound pork sirloin roast, and made just half the sauce. It worked out perfectly. Though I probably could have cut the cooking time a little, as it was already over 170 degrees when I took it out at 90 minutes, it still came out tender and delicious.

I usually don't deviate from the original ingredients because it wouldn't be fair to rate the recipe, however, this time I didn't have the apple jelly and I had a pork roast to cook.  New Englanders always have maple syrup on hand, so I replaced the apple jelly with maple syrup.....IT WAS delicious!!    I used apple cider vinegar also. I will try the apple jelly also, but now this option will be used many times in the future!!

This is the second pork loin recipe I've tried and it is the best one so far.  LOVED the sauce with this one and the flavor was good.   Still not as moist as I would have liked but it could be that I'm must not used to cooking pork but I'll definitely try this one again.. maybe in the crock pot.  It was a good Sunday dinner.

This meal is fantastic!  My fiance loved it and this is the second time in two weeks I'm cooking it and he's happy to be eating it again!  We had leftover sauce from the first batch, so this time around it'll be a piece of cake to make!  I accidentally put ALL the chili powder as a rub...lol.  Gave it an extra kick and I'm glad I did that.  I didn't put any salt on it b/c we're not salt lovers and it was perfect.  Loved it loved it loved it...in fact I better get to cooking round two right now!  :)  Thanks!

Awesome! I am not a huge pork fan, but my hubby is and this was great! I did use apricot preserves, bbq sauce (1/4 cup) and 1/2 tsp of ketchup. Turned out great!

My fiancee and I just made this for dinner and it was DELICIOUS!  We put on a little more rub than the recipe instructed, and also poured more of the sauce over the roast to bake than was suggested.  We loved it and will definitely be making it again!  By the way, it smells HEAVENLY!

I'm always a little dismayed when reviewers say how incredible the recipe is after they've altered it however with his particular recipe I found myself without apple jelly so I substituted Apricot jelly and a dash of apple juice. It turned out absolutely amazing! Everyone of my kids gobbled it up and were craving more and we have three very picky eaters. I will definitely be doing this one again, thanks to the original recipe.

Great every time!  The sauce isn't written in stone, ate least in my book.  I add BBQ sauce, but just a little..about 1/4 cup.  I have 1lb roasts I got on sale..so I halved the recipe.  I added brown sugar to the rub on this one (my 3rd roast).  I add just a TAD of ketchup, about 1/2 teaspoon.  What you want is that tang to balance the sweet. I am using apricot preserves.  The sauce tastes great as I'm cooking it up.  It has a taste all it's own, whatever preserves you us. Love this recipe. It's so EAZY..and comes out just GOURmet.

Delicious! I didn't have apple jelly but I did have cherry jelly and it was so good.  I found that the "rub" wasn't nearly enough to cover the roast I had, so I doubled it.  And my roast was only 3 lb. Don't rely on the 90 minutes in this recipe. Monitor the temperature of your piece of meat so you don't overcook it and dry it out. Also, my roast didn't have any "drippings" for some reason, but the glaze was still awesome.

Everyone loved the zippy sauce on this roast! Since I didn't have garlic salt on hand I put thin slivers of fresh garlic all over the roast. Yummy!

Yummy!!! I cooked potatoes with the pork loin, so I would suggest covering the dish with part of the sauce after about 30-45 minutes of cooking, so that they are marinated.  This was an excellent dish and even better the next day.  We will make it again!

Other than cutting back a tad on the jelly/ketchup combo, upping the vinegar [apple-cider] by another Tablespoon, adding one more teaspoon of chili powder along with several garlic slivers stuck inside the roast, I pretty much followed this recipe to a T...[LOL - that almost Never happens!!].  The sauce was aMAZing, the meat, tender, juicy & Gone - my guests nearly Licked their dishes clean!!!  This is Definitely a keeper recipe - Thanks for sharing!

One acronym sums up how I feel about this dish. OMG! So good! I used a .81lb pork tenderloin (recalculate the servings to 3) Came out so tender and the flavor was awesome! Saving it in my recipe box!

This was ok we weren't crazy about it. I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce was more of a glorified ketchup than anything. Don't think I will use again.

I also reduced the ketchup to 3/4 cup and used grape jelly, and made the following changes in the rub:  I replaced the salt with seasoning salt, and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I also added pepper and onion powder. I put the roast on a cookie sheet and baked it in the oven on 250 for about an hour, then transferred it (cookie sheet and all) to the BBQ and smoked it until it was done (about 90 mins).  About 15 mins before it came off of the BBQ, I brushed it with the sauce.  It had a terrific smoky flavor that was hard to beat!!

I like this recipe, but even after decreasing the ketchup to 3/4 cup, the sauce still tastes like a sweet ketchup sauce.  I added 1/4 tsp. each of celery seed, onion powder, and black pepper to give it a little more of a barbecue sauce flavor.   I would also recommend lining the pan with aluminum foil because after the glaze is brushed on the pork, it drips and burns on the pan.

YUM!  I didn't change a thing.  My 6 and 7 1/2 year olds loved it too!  I whipped up some mashed potatoes to go with it, and spooned the sauce over the potatoes and meat!  Yum!  Reeealy nice tasting sauce!

Made this for a big Christmas dinner and it was a resounding success. The only thing we did different was cut the ketchup to 3/4 cup as other reviewers had suggested.

I make this using equal parts jelly to barbeque (instead of ketchup and vinegar).  We love it.  The chili powder is subtle.

Mmm, really good.  I ended up with way more sauce than needed, though.  I will probably half the sauce ingredients next time around.

I couldn't find apple jelly in my grocery store.  I used apricot jelly instead, and it seemed to work out OK.

nice moist roast.I prefer traditional gravy to this one though.I kind of see where you're going with it but its not quite right.Maybe brown sugar instead of the jelly would be less "sweety/ketchupy"tasting.A little saltiness (perhaps soy sauce) could help as well.

I used this sauce on pork chops. (browned them 5 mins on each side and covered them with the sauce and baked covered at 375 for half an hour) This is an awesome recipe!

Fabulous!  I didn't have apple jelly on hand so I sustituted apricot preserves.  I also used a little less ketchup and added two or three tablespoons of apple juice.  I poured all the sauce over the roast, golden potatoes, baby carrots and green beans and baked.  The whole family loved it.  It was 100% complain free recipe.  (that's a rarity in my house!)

I had to use reduced sugar jelly (I have blood sugar issues) and the only kind I could find at the store was grape, so I used that.  Also, I started basting the pork roast with glaze right away because I love that gooey, browned taste of glaze that it gets from the roasting process.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly except to add a little cayenne to the rub.  I thought this was really good, but DH didn't care for the taste of the glaze.  Thank you for the recipe.

Yummy!  I was skeptical but man this was good.  My husband went on and on about how great it was.  Will make this again because it is so easy and such a nice change.  You should definitely serve this with mashed potatoes, but what isn't good with mashed potatoes?  I doubled the rub as I had a pretty big roast, but didn't need to double the sauce. Thanks for this recipe!!! Love it!

This may be the only way I ever do a Pork Roast again....oh my God was this incredible. More flavor than may be allowed by law. A tossed salad and baked potato and you have a wonderful meal....the only thing better was the leftovers..... Simple to prepare...and hard to stop eating...I only gave it five stars, because the web site won't allow me to give it ten !!!

The roast turned out great and my wife loved the sauce. I used half a cup of ketchup (just ran out) and substituted barbq sauce.

Very good! Cut down ketchup slightly, but other than that followed exactly.

Phenominal. I also cut back on the ketchup (used ~3/4 cup) and doubled the rub. This is a great, great recipe.

Very easy, very good.  My company asked for the recipe.  Please note that I doubled the "rub".

This roast was great. My husband and I loved it. I used less ketchup, like in the other reviews. I also used grape jelly because I didn't have any apple jelly on hand, and the result was delicious!

Excellent recipe.  Could not find apple jelly in my small town, but I had on-hand home made pomegranate jelly and substituted it.  A wonderful change and look forward to trying it again with apple jelly!

Excellant!  I did cut back to 1 1/2 tsp chilli powder; I wasn't sure.  Next time, I will add full amount.  The roast was perfect.

This was DELICIOUS!!! I did reduce ketchup to 3/4 cup and sauce was still plenty sweet.  Added 1/2 tspn cayenne pepper to rub.  Roast took about 1 hour LONGER in my oven (about 2 1/2 hrs or so).  Will definitely make again!

This is hands down one of my family's favorites.  We just double the amount of sauce for the mashed potatoes.  The kids lick the plate clean.

Best pork roast recipe! I changed the sauce by using 1/2 c ketchup and white wine vinegar (as others had) but I also used red pepper jelly instead of apple jelly.
