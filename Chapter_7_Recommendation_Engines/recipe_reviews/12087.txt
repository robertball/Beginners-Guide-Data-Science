I love this pie.  In fact, I brought this to a friend's potluck and everyone loved it just as much.  All 8 of us agreed it would be worth it to diet all week just to have a big slice of this pie for dessert!  Thanks for this one.

Tried this and the family loved it!  You may want to decrease the nut measurement to 1 cup, though.

I made this pie for Mother's Day dinner, and everyone absolutely loved it :)  My husband made a point to tell me 3 different times that it was his favorite pie ever!  I guess I'll be making this recipe many more times.  Only change I made was I doubled the coconut so that I would have a thicker coating on the bottom.  I read that some people thought less nuts, but I completely disagree.  It's an amazing recipe.  Thank you Linda for sharing.

This is the first pie I ever made (we don't have them in Europe) and it was excellent - I happen to like that it was not overly sweet, yet full of flavor.  Just one thing: it took 15-20 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said it would. A little confusing for a first-time pie baker like me, but it all turned out well in the end and everyone else liked it too. Try hazelnuts as a replacement for the macadamia - also great!

This was an interesting recipe.  I love macadamia nuts, but this pie needed more sugar.  I think I was expecting something as rich as my pecan pie.  I also would reduce the amount of nuts to 1 1/2 cups and increase the coconut to 1/2 cup.

This was ok. The topping needs some more flavor, and my crust burned a little. Everyone else loved it though. I also substituted different nuts, using what I had on hand.

This was very good, and pretty easy to make. I did everything exactly as written, only I added about 1/4 cup confectioners sugar to the whipped cream to make it a tad sweeter. I also just added the whole topping of whipped cream to the pie, instead of just adding it to individual pieces. It was a very delicious and unique pie! YUM! Thanks!
