Spence's Pesto Chicken Pasta Haiku: "This IS elegant. Flavorful, vibrant colors. A couple small tweaks." I was doubtful of putting that many "special" veggies all together, thinking their flavors would compete w/ one another, but it turned out to be a lovely dish. I didn't have quite as many mushrooms, and I had to sub hearts of palm for the artichoke hearts (close enough); I also added a handful of diced onion to the initial saute. Otherwise I was completely faithful to the recipe and was pleasantly surprised w/ the end result. When I make this again, I plan to increase the spinach, and stir a bit of the pasta water into the chick/vegg mixture for additional moisture b/c it was a bit dry. (Or instead of just tossing the linguine w/ the pesto, split the pesto into the chicken/vegg too.)

This was wonderful! I had to make changes because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used frozen spinach instead of fresh - still yummy - and I used broccoli and fresh red bell pepper. This will be one of our regulars. Thanks!!

Awesome! instead of peppers I did sundried tomatoes and I actually forgot the spinach but it was better because there was already a lot going on flavor wise! Oh, and instead of whole cloves of garlic I sliced them so as to disperse the garlic flavor! VERY VERY good! *****

I am confused: at the top it says 4 servings (?only one chicken breast) and at the bottom it says divide pasta onto 2 plates.  Which is correct?

The reviews helped me to tweak this recipe to make it really zing. I used skinless, boneless thighs instead of breasts so that the chicken had more flavor and moisture. When cooking, I started out by browning the mushrooms to give them added flavor. Then I tossed them into a bowl with the chopped garlic, peppers, and artichokes and added them altogether with the chicken after it had browned for five minutes. Later, I added 1/2 cup of dry white wine and half the pesto to the simmering vegetables. It turned out very well!

I've been making something very similar to this for years - my recipe came from Food & Wine.  To give it a little kick I add chopped sun-dried tomatoes and sun-dried tomato pesto instead of the basil pesto, but both are good.  This is one yummy dish!

My husband and I loved this recipe!! I tweeked it a little because of the ingredients I had on hand. I didnt have any roasted peppers or artichoke hearts. I added finely diced red bell peppers, diced tomatoes, and mushrooms in with the same pan I had cooked the chicken and garlic in, and fried it for a few minutes, until fragrant. I wanted the excess water of the tomatoes out so I kept the stove on high until all the water evaporated and stirred occasionally. I added the spinach at the end and it turned out to be amazing! Also I took one cup of heavy cream and heated it on the stove until it was reduced to half, and then mixed it with the pesto, it was the perfect pesto cream sauce! I mixed the pesto cream sauce with the linguini and topped it off with the chicken mixture, it looked and tasted absolutley amazing!!

Delicious and so colorful. Left out the artichokes, added minced onion, sliced portobello mushrooms caps, chopped proscuitto and white wine to the chicken, garlic and red pepper sautee before adding loads of spinach. Tossed with the linguine and pesto, then sprinkled with pecorino romano cheese.  Thank you for great recipe - will definitely make again.

This was good but could have been better. I used the exact ingredients but felt the cooking time for the chicken pieces was way too long. Came out dry. Next time I would shorten the chicken cooking time to 3-4 min. then toss in the balance of ingredients for a total of 10 min.
It lacked some acidity or oomph. Next time I will broil some lemon halves and allow each diner to squeeze to their taste. Will make again but with adjustments.

Great taste and very easy.  Tried sun-dried tomatoes instead of the roasted red peppers... was a great compliment to the basil.

I made this recipe as a salad, turned out really good! I used Fusilli pasta and made the Pesto myself. I browned the chicken breast (whole) in a frying pan and put it in the oven for 15 minutes til done, that made it really juicy. Then I cut it into bite size pieces. I also used less garlic.

I LOVED this recipe, which I served to my husband and dinner guests last night. My guests arrived one full hour early :( so I literally cooked while we visited. I doubled the recipe so that we'd have leftovers for hubbies lunch. Followed recipe, but cut back on artichokes a little (not hubbies favorite :) and minced three large cloves of garlic - less than called for. Next time I'll add more mushrooms, called for amount of artichokes and garlic, and add extra spinach - maybe 50% more. I used FOUR chicken breast halves. Sauteed them in HOT olive oil/butter mix until well browned. Then removed from pan while sauteeing mushrooms (and I added red onion). Then sliced chicken breasts and let everything simmer on lowest heat while I cooked pasta. Then added spinach and pesto. Chicken was slightly undercooked when I sliced; perfectly cooked and tender after simmering. Even my slightly picky, older guests loved this and asked for seconds. Definitely a keeper - Thank you ChezCristy!!

This recipe is AMAZING!!!!! The only thing I found, although I may have used too large of garlic cloves, but I would at least chop the garlic up. Everything else? It flew into my recipe box. Definitely a keeper and definitely something I will look forward to preparing for guests. Thanks so much~

This was delicious! I made it for my boyfriend and his family and they loved it. I did a couple things differently, I used more mushrooms and pesto and used bow tie pasta instead and it was delicious. I've done this recipe a couple times now and I think it's divine.

Instead of whole cloves of garlic- crushed 3-4 cloves. Added a little pasta water to the mixture so it wouldn't be too dry.

Excellent! I doubled the chicken and spinach. Had I doubled the pasta this could easily serve 4 as an entree. I think as written it would only serve two. I may add sliced black olives next time. Thanks for sharing this!!

This was a great and easy dish to make! I impressed my guest with this dish more than I was expecting. I'm not a fan of mushrooms and couldnt find red peppers, so I instead used some sliced cherry tomatoes, sweet onions, and added some cayenne pepper seasoning to the chicken and it was great! I suggest, as it is in the picture I posted, to add a veggie like green beans or brussel sprouts as a side dish to bring it all together.

Great dish! I made this for my pre-teen daughters thinking they weren't going to like the spinach but it turns out they loved the dish so much that There was no left overs and I made a whole box of the pasta. I had to make the whole dish again two days later. Great for large families.

I enjoyed this recipe but I'd say that you must love pesto to enjoy it.  I added extra pesto since I though it was a bit bland at first.

This was good, all the ingredients worked really well together but it lacked flavor.  I marinated my chicken in olive oil, garlic and parmessn cheese all day but I wish I had allowed more time for the mushroom, artichokes and peppers to really bring out there flavor while cooking but since the pasta was done I couldn't hold off any longer.

This is fantastic! I have always made it with chicken, pesto and leek, but this version has got style!! The plain version has always been a hit with my kids, but hubby and I love the additions. Next time I make it, I will leave out the mushrooms, not because I don't like them, but my kids complain too much :) 5 out of 5!

DELICIOUS!  Hard to believe something so yummy could be so easy to prepare. Great dish for family or guests.  Easily can be doubled to serve larger group (or to have leftovers). The only changes I made was to season the chicken with salt, pepper AND garlic powder.  I added kalamata olives and sundried tomoates. No doubt, this would be excellent just as is. Thanks, Spence, for a super good, super easy recipe.

Made this recipe for dinner last night, I had to tweak this recipe a lttle because it is too dry. I ended up adding1.5 cups of water since my family always prefer gravy on the pasta. Here's what I did:
Added 1.5 cups water (chicken broth), more S/P, more spinach, 1 .5 cups of pesto and 2 cubes of chicken bouillion. I sude angel hair pasta on this one. I skip the artichokes because i ddn't have it on hand. I also breaded the Thin sliced, cut up chicken breast only because we don't like our meat thick. This is better than  chicken scampi.

This is the best dish I have made in a long time.  I added a splash of white wine.  Made this last week and again today to take to a friends house.  Perfect dish for company.

I followed the recipe to the letter. IT was fantastic. I was of the opinion before I made it that there would be too many flavors but I was wrong on this. It was perfect!

This was pretty good, but didn't stand out as amazing. I did not have the roasted red peppers so I left that out. Also, I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh, using the liquid from it to cook the chicken. I think it worked out well so the dish wasn't dry. I was happy the kids liked it even though it had lots of interesting vegetables.

Really tasty and colorful for a nice presentation.  The whole family loved it! I used homemade garlic scape pesto that I freeze for the winter months and used a few less garlic cloves to compensate. I might increase the amount of spinach by a bit next time.

This recipe was easy to make, simple ingredients and tasted fantastic. The 3 things I really like about a dish!
I recommend it highly. If you like Italian/Greek this dish is for you. second time we made it I added some black olives, sundried tomato and dusted it with feta instead of parm

This was tasty. Unfortunately, we didn't have mushrooms or artichokes and we think it would be delish with those added ingredients! Subbed red leaf lettuce for the spinach and it was good. I did slice the garlic and added some onion. 
Doubled the recipe for the family.

Good recipe!  I omitted the mushrooms and added an additional chicken breast.  I will definitely make again, only next time I will cut down on the garlic I added to the chicken.  I used a homemade pesto that had a lot of garlic.  So, the 2 together were a tad overpowering.  I will also add more spinach and maybe at bit more liquid to the chicken mixture.  But a very good and simple recipe.

Would've been better with mushrooms (my husband won't eat them) and more chicken.  Also kind of dry.  Next time I may add some chicken broth to reduce and scrap up the bits of yummies from the pan.

Did everything as stated except added some onion and cooked the chicken for only three minutes or so before adding other ingredients.  It was a lot more mellow than I expected.  Hubby loved it.  A little too greasy/olive oily for me, but I still enjoyed it.  I think the parmesan cheese was the star ingredient though as far as flavor is concerned.

Great flavor from all the ingredients. I would have added more artichokes (cuz I love em) and more basil pesto to the pasta. You could use chicken thighs instead and maybe squeeze some lemon juice on top. Will make again but tweek to my liking.

This recipe was excellent! I'm not a fan of red peppers so I substituted a 6.5 oz jar of sun dried tomatoes, and it was awesome!  I'm sure its good with the red peppers too.  You really can use any kind of pasta (I only had elbows on hand) and to make it even quicker you can get the pre cooked chicken strips like Perdue Carved Chicken Breast. Good stuff, and I even had a picky eater try it and like it!

This dish was yummy!  I did have to add a tad of butter to get the chicken to brown a bit.  It does make 4 servings but the instructions at the end about dividing between two plates was a bit confusing.  I also think the garlic should be chopped or minced -don't care to bite into a whole garlic clove.  Otherwise wonderful - I'm passing it along!

Very tasty but too dry. Not sure what to do to make it more saucy so will probably not make again.  Maybe not serve it on pasta but with potatoes and make as chicken breasts. Not sure.

This was intensely flavorful and delicious!   I used homemade pesto (that I had in the freezer) withfreshly boiled  penne but followed the vegetable mixture as per recipe.  I will make this again and again and it’s the perfect dish for company!  Great way to use homemade pesto.

This is a great base recipe that can be altered to include whatever veggies you have on hand. I've added broccoli, fresh red pepper, frozen and fresh spinach, etc. I sometimes add more chicken and less pasta for a low-carb version.

Great recipe foundation! I adjusted it based on what I had on hand and family preferences.  1st, I seasoned the chicken using Newman's Own Vinaigrette salad dressing, homemade pesto, and crushed chili piquin, letting it marinate about 10 hours. 2nd, I substituted fresh red bell pepper for roasted, added zucchini, porcini mushrooms, and cauliflower and used orrechiette instead of linguine.  I also skipped the marinated artichokes and cheese and cut the garlic back to 2 cloves due to food sensitivities. It came out great! Even works well as a cold salad if you add some fresh spinach or romaine lettuce. Use EVOO and balsamic or more pesto for the dressing.

Your boyfriend is an awesome chef!!!  I made this the first time for a family gathering, and it was a hit.  I doubled the recipe and fed 16-18 adults (along with salad, bread and dessert).  My variations were as follows:
1.  substituted two small size (8 oz I think) packs of sliced baby portobellos for the mushrooms;
2.  Used 1 and 1/2 lbs linguini);
3.  Used Tyson Italian Herb & Tomato Grilled & Ready Frozen Chicken tenders (1 and 2/3's bags - bags were about 22 oz each);
4. Used 3/4 Cup of Freshly made pesto;
5.  Doubled or slightly more than doubled the roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts and spinach
I will definitely cook this again and am thinking of more variations to try.   Thank you Spence

Made this twice and love the recipe!  Only thing I add is 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes at the end.  I notice several reviews think it's dry but I didn't experience that at all - I leave the lid on the skillet to keep moisture in.  Thanks for sharing!

Will make again. I was out of spinach, so I used kale instead and it turned out great. The artichokes really make it unique, so don't skip those.

We absolutely loved this recipe!  I was skeptical about adding artichoke hearts to a pasta recipe, but to my surprise it totally made the dish. Thanks for sharing.

It's really good. The only thing that I will change next time is - I will use sundried tomatoes instead of the roasted red peppers. I liked it.

I only added about 3 tablespoons of Amish butter to the spinach after it wilted and before adding all of the ingredients to the linguine. A suggestion might be to save some of the oil marinade from the artichokes/hearts of palm and roasted red peppers to add to the linguine in the event it seems too dry.   This was an amazing meal, and I will definitely make it again!

Thanks for the idea because I add my on twist to this recipe. I grilled lots of veggies with my chicken and added 3/4 cup of pesto. Also, I added Italian blended cheese to it

Okay I made this dish and it was phenomenal. I made a few changes  according to my taste. I tasted a dish Similar at a restaurant and wanted to make it my own. Add asparagus, bean sprouts, and no mushrooms. I also, used extra spinach , and extra oil because I like more saucy pastas. I've also used salmon and chicken, both taste delicious.  Great dish husband and friends love it!

I feed two daughters.  I was apprehensive,  they often dislike meals where the food is mixed together.  They took small servings but went back for seconds. Second servings were bigger than first. I took it as high compliment.

This MAY be my favorite meal I've made on this website.  It takes some time to make (basil pesto from scratch with pine nuts and all), but it is SO worth it!  Everytime I make this, I have to make extra to freeze for leftovers.  We LOVE this meal.  
Thank you for sharing!!

My whole family loved this!  It was so easy to prepare, but felt like it was "going out to eat" worthy.  Some minor changes I made to this recipe were that I used a whole pound of chicken instead of 1/2 (just thought with a family of 4 it needed more) but I used the same amount of everything else and we ended up with no leftovers.  I also used diced garlic instead of whole cloves as I didn't have any fresh garlic on me and since my teenagers don't like artichokes that much, I coarsely chopped them so they wouldn't notice them and they both said this recipe was "a keeper"!

Very good, even without the pasta/pesto mix.  I ate the chicken mix leftover by itself for lunch.  There are several powerful tastes present yet they all mix well and don't take over each other.  I would say double the artichokes.  The pesto/pasta mixture will only be as good as the pesto you purchase- so get the good stuff (I've had very bad pesto before).

I really liked this recipe because it was simple and quick. I doubled the recipe and added more garlic and sautéed onions. Oh and I also cooked two slices of turkey bacon until crispy (bacon makes everything better) to flavor the spinach. And I made a whole packet of pesto sauce. I think this recipe is open to variations of any vegetables you have on hand.

I always make the recipes the first time as written; but part way into it I realized this dish needed saving fast. I read that others had deglazed the pan with wine, and this did add needed moisture; I also needed to add about 1/4 cup chicken broth. Cooking the chicken whole and then cutting at an angle after searing helped keep it moist; starting out with chicken pieces would have made it dried out. Will not be making this again!

This was a very easy to prepare and tasty dish. 
I made a few modifications:  
-doubled the recipe by adding a pound a 
 shrimp and extra pasta.  
-added sliced red onions 
-left out the spinach and artichokes. 
 (I would have used both if I had it on  
  hand)  
-used whole wheat pasta
-added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the 
 meat mixture
I will definitely be making this again with all of the ingredients!

This tastes great! I agree that the chicken cook time is too long and makes it tough. Also, I used artichoke bottoms instead of hearts b/c the leaves on hearts can sometimes be tough. Otherwise, it was a fantastic dish!

Excellent!  The only changes I made were to omit the mushrooms (I don't like) and add some onion. I'm surprised by the reviewer who stated that it lacked flavor, as I found it to be VERY tasty!

This was a great and easy recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the artichokes since I'm not a huge fan. My dinner guest was also very impressed. Next time I might try adding some sliced prosciutto or white wine for a little extra kick. Will definitely make this again.
