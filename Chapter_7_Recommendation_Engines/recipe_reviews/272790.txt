I used egg noodles instead of bow-tie and instead of fresh dill I used dill weed seasoning and regular mustard instead dejon mustard. And added a tish of half and half by cutting down mayo by a tish it helped sweetened it up too.

We decided this would be delicious with chopped apples and topped with chow mein noodles on top. This is definitely a salad we will have all Summer!

Like Nel did, we added a handful of  pre-cooked salad shrimp then made as directed in the recipe.  If you use shrimp, toss with a pinch of red pepper and let sit while the pasta is cooking.

Made this for my mother and she loved it! It has just the right amount of mayo. I really liked it too  and I don't even like peas...LOL Will make again for sure.
