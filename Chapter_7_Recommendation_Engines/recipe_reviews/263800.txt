I made Sticky NECTARINE Chicken instead. I have some very ripe nectarines that I pitted and boiled in enough water to cover them. I added some non-sugar sugar. Pur√©ed the nectarines and skin with an immersion blender. Then added the rest of the sauce ingredients. We are not folks who like it really hot so I halved the pepper sauce. It was still more heat than we wanted. I added some more nectarine juice which helped.
