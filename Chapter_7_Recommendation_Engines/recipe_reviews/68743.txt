This icing is wonderful!! Very light and not too sweet! I think the trick is to beat the egg/sugar/cream of tartar mixture first before adding the boiling water. Then add the vanilla. We had no problem getting it fluffy as did the last review. Extra icing also stores well in the frig for later use.

FANTASTIC! I didnt have any cream of tartar so I used salt and it came out fantastically.  I had to beat it for about 3 minutes longer but WOW! It was gobbled up with requests for more. (I used it on deep dish brownies.)
A keeper!

This is yummy! Very easy, too! I was a little worried when I put all the ingredients in the bowl and saw a brownish colored mess, but was more than pleased to discover that after some faithful beating, it turned into a beautiful, fluffy white icing! Thanks!

this turned out so wonderful! 
right at the end of beating i added just about 1/4 package of lime jello mix. it gave the icing perfect amount of a lime flavor and a beautiful light green color. 
you can mix and match different colors and flavors to get some really great tastes!
i am not a fan of frosting, so this was perfect for me on cupcakes!

This took forever!  I had to beat it for 35 minutes to get it anywhere stiff enough to frost a cake.  Stiff peaks never did come into the picture.  Absolute thumbs down.

i made this icing for angel food cake.  very good!!  would suggest storing iced cake in the fridge, as the icing "sweats" the sugar into a syrup on the bottom of the plate, when left out on counter.

Wonderful! Very easy.  I blended the sugar, egg white and creme of tartar together first, then added the boiling water.  I had doubled the recipe, but there was no need as it made plenty.  I was skeptical at first b/c it took a while.  It took about 12 minutes with the stand mixer and turned out lovely.  Make sure to serve the same day it's prepared.  Will definitely use again!:)

This is just like my Grandma used to make and I have been searching for this recipe for years. I halved this recipe and put 2 tablespoons of Marshmallow creme into the mixture. Turned out perfect and plenty for my Angel food cake. This is definitely a keeper.

I just made this icing and it turned out beautifully! I'm not sure if it matters or not but I had my ingredients (egg white) at room temperature (I put all the ingredients except water in a bowl while the cake was baking and cooling). 

I added a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients (1/8 tsp?), mixed the ingredients and then added the boiling water. I found it took about 5-6 minutes on medium / med-high speed (I started on medium for a few minutes and finished on med-high).

This icing was beautiful and very easy to make.  I would highly recommend a stand mixer to get the egg whites to peak.  Need to use the icing the same day since the icing will "weep" if stored.  Definately a keeper!!

i found this one too weak to pair with chocolate cupcakes. It is tasty and light though. Overnight it turned much more foamy and I didn't have too much success keeping in the fridge - it seperated.

I was skeptical because it took so long of beating to get this to a somewhat thick consistency.  I probably beat for 15 minutes.  The frosting was still too thin for decorations, but ok for spreading on a cake.  It was light and fluffy and tasted ok.  I wouldn't make again.

Nice, easy recipe with impressive looking results.  Stand mixer is a must.  I can't imagine standing there that long with a hand-held.  Probably what happened to the batch that didn't turn out.  I substituted 1/4 tsp salt for cream of tartar and it seems fine.  I think the creme of tarter helps it to keep its shape for longer...

Loved it!!  Perfectly not too sweet...it did take a long time for me to beat it to the right state but that may have been the little extra vanilla extract that go in there.

Had zero problems making this icing. I decided to try it because I was out of confectioner's sugar. It pipes very nicely with easy cleanup of the bags. Did not like the taste of this icing. The next day the raw egg whites in it made it impossible for me to eat. A stronghold in my mind about the raw eggs I suppose but still did not enjoy this icing. Don't care for storing cupcakes in the refrigerator but with the raw eggs in the icing it had to be so. Won't make this again.

I thought it tasted absolutely delicious but didn't fluff up as much as it was supposed to which is why I gave it 4 stars.  Everyone loved it though! I will be making it again this week for my mom because she loved it when I made it last week!

I did not care for this recipe. I beat this on high for 15 minutes in my kitchen aid mixer w/ the wisk attachment & it never turned into anything but a brown stick mess.

Very easy.  This was my first time making an icing with cream of tarter... and despite any worries, this came out fabulous, light and fluffy. I heeded the advice of others and mixed everything first in my standup mixer then added the boiling water.  Took about 7 minutes on med-high speed.  Light and pretty for my peach coconut cake.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Wow - so easy and tastes just like boiled icing, without all the work! Light, fluffy and delicious! Thanks for posting it!  By the way, the whisk attachment made it whip up very quickly.

Very yummy tasting! But more a meringue than frosting. I was afraid of using raw egg, so I opted for powdered egg white. I also did not have cream of tartar, but looked up an alternative online (1/4 teaspoon lemon juice for every 1/8 teaspoon of cream of tartar).

It worked fine, using a stand mixer, taking about 10 minutes of beating. I could have eaten the whole bowl, right there in the kitchen, and not even spread it on the cake :)

The day after, the liquid in the egg white seeped into the cake (good thing, as it needed it). However, the meringue was a bit dry.

I would make this for an 'on-the-day' cake that will get eaten entirely (like a picnic or party). On the second day, I drizzled a bit of soft jam over it, and that helped. I would not make it for a keeper cake, as it quickly deteriorates.

Thank you, though, for providing an alternative cake frosting! I can envisage other uses for it, and will make it again for these.

I was pretty dissapointed with this recipe. I beat the icing with an electric hand mixer for more than twenty minutes before I gave up. While I am sure that the icing would have tasted great, I just don't have enough time to beat an icing for half an hour.

it tasted realy good but for the life of me i could not get it to whip up. I think that the recipy calls for to much water. but you can make it pretty much any flavor by ading a different extract i used peppermint.

Loved this recipe. I like frosting but it was a hot day out and I didn't feel like heavy butter icing so this was a nice change. I will defiantly make this again!
I added a little jello powder for extra taste and food coloring for color, however it did take alot of food color to make a noticeable difference.

Ok, there is apparently some kind of trick with this recipe. Half of the reviews state that is unbelievably fantastic and the other half say it is terrible and didn't even make icing. I am, unfortunately, one of the latter half! I have been at it for half an hour, followed the directions to a T, and still have nothing but milky liquid!  What's the trick here people??

This worked perfectly! I dipped cupcakes into the frosting, twisted them a little, then pulled them out. It made a very cute curly-Q on top. The kids especially loved this frosting and I will definately make it again.

This never thickened.  I beat it over 1/2 hour and it never thickened.  Disappointed!

I doubled this, added one extra egg white and left out the cream of tartar (that is really only needed when you are going to have the cake on hand for more than a day or two) I used on tsp of vanilla and one of maple flavoring (I wish I could find the alcohol free flavors) as it was for a butter pecan cake.  I have enough icing for a 10 inch layer cake and a bunt cake PLUS some left over.  I have a Kitchen Aid mixer and using the whip it took about 12 minutes to get the soft peaks but it spread very nicely and did not tear up the cake.  It has been about an hour now, the peaks are still on the cake so it did not "soften slide and fall" and seems to be holding it's form very well.  I am not sure if it will get the harder, sticky texture of boiled frosting and if it does I do not mind.  Right now I am very very happy with this and will use it often!

Excellent!   The important thing is to mix it at the highest speed possible without splattering, increasing the speed as it becomes thicker and thicker. It took me about 7 to 8 minutes.  Makes a huge amount.

I tried this twice to make sure it wasn't me, this frosting just doesn't wanna whip! I eventually had to add 1/2 c of powdered sugar and 3 tbsps of cornstarch to get it stiff enough to frost. And even then it took my KitchenAid mixer a good 15 minutes to produce anything fluffy.

I followed another user's advice and used ingredients at room temperature, and also added 1/8 tsp. salt. It took 25 minutes to reach peaks on my standard non-standing mixer. But I love the light fluffiness of texture, and the marshmallow flavor! This recipe I will use again, possibly altering the ingredients to try to get a thicker consistency.

It was easy to make, tasted wonderful. I also added dye to it to make it orange for a cupcake. It kinda scared me that it was brown at first but then I beat it for about 3 minutes and it turned white so after about 5 or 6 minutes it was done and complete. I will make this again and will tell friends and family about this recipe. It is wonderful.

Oh my goodness----I finally found it!  I have been looking for the icing that my grandmother used on her angel food cake, and I never knew what it was called, or even what it was. I always thought it had marshmallows in it. It was so good and I finally came across a recipe that sounded right, but it was awfully complicated, and just before I tried it, I saw this recipe, and hallelujah--it was perfect.  It was so easy,  just a little time consuming since I used a hand mixer, but well worth it. It set up really well after I iced the cake and put it in the fridge for a few hours.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I am so excited to have found this easy and delicious recipe!

I made this and it turned out amazing!  I think the trick that worked for me was to blend the sugar, egg white and cream of tartar first on a low speed using the whisk attachment.  Then added the boiling water.   I turned up the speed on my mixer to the highest setting, and let it mix for seven minutes, added some vanilla and a few drops of coconut extract. It was super light and fluffy, not overly sweet at all. I frosted my cupcakes once they were completely cooled.  Incredibly easy to make!

I have made this icing twice and both times it looks great  when you make it but give it a few hours and it starts breaking down into a sugary syrup.  I don't know what I am doing wrong.  Made sure the water was boiling and made sure I beat it long enough.  This time I used my Christmas present Kitchen Aid mixer with the whisk and it turned syrupy even faster than the first time.   It still tastes good but you have to eat it fast.  What am I doing wrong?

What a great recipe! I added the boiling water after beating the   other ingredients. It was so soupy at that point that I thought it was a failure. But I let the whisk attachment do it's work for a few minutes ( I didn't time it) and it thickened up beautifully. Sweet but not heavy. This just became a favorite.

This was FANTASTIC. I don’t normally go out of my way to rate anything,  but I had to.

I followed as some other ratings suggested by mixing the sugar, egg white and cream of t first, then adding the boiling water then vanilla as I mixed (whisk attachment on a stand mixer). Good medium speed for about 5 mins and it came out perfect! So easy and light on the angel food cake I’d made.

I love this frosting! Light, fluffy. Peaks are holding well, plenty for 2-layer cake.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar and had no vanilla. Used hand mixer starting on low to blend sugar, egg white and cream of tartar, then slowly drizzled boiling water, increasing speed. It took about 8 minutes to come to nice peaks, and I added 2 Tblsp of orange jello at the end for a beautiful light orange color and hint of taste for my spice cake.
Will definitely make more often.

I will make this again and again! I followed the directions using a suggestion to mix everything before adding boiling water, also tempered mix prior to adding all the water. I simply could not be happier, finally an icing that tastes as good as it looks and doesn’t require refrigeration. This is just like my Mom’s special cake icing recipe I’ve been searching for it over 25 years.

This is a really great recipe!!! I followed the recommendation of mixing the egg white, sugar and cream of tartar first before adding the boiled water and vanilla and the recipe was FLAWLESS!!! Great flavor, not too sweet...JUST RIGHT!

This was an excellent way to make icing for an angel food cake.  Icing doesn't keep but I seldom have leftovers of an angel food cake.

Took 16 min to get any kind of peaks. I had made it before with lemon juice instead of tartar and it actually tasted better and was thicker. Probably won’t make it again.

if i could give this recipe a minus i would. I tried to make this and all i got was a sticky liquid mess and the only place to spread was down the drain. I bake on a daily basis and this is the first recipe that i have had a problem. i thought i maybe made a mistake so i tried it again and got the same mess. i wouldn't recommend this recipe to even my worst enemy. Don't egg whites stand themselves why boiling water? It just doesn't work. Sorry to the one this recipe belongs to but ........just sorry.

Tried it today and loved the results. Had to whip it longer than suggested for the proper thickness, but as with most icing, patience is the key.

When I first started mixing the ingredients in my mixer I was really concerned because it looked like water and I couldn't imagine it thickening.  However, after about 7 or 8 minutes on high speed I had a beautiful, fluffy frosting that was more than enough to cover a tall angel food cake.  I also added 4 packets of True Lemon and yellow food coloring.  Great recipe and so much easier than boiled frosting.

So simple to make and delicious! I used my kitchenaid mixer with the whip beater and it was thick fluffy frosting in about seven minutes. This frosting tastes like the seven minute frosting but so much easier to make. I haven’t tried it yet, but I bet this frosting would be delicious on chocolate ice cream as it tastes like marshmallow cream topping. Yummy!

This was delightful. It's like a fluffy candy coating. Everyone loved it. Be patient because it does take a bit to whip up. I used my Kitchenaid. If you do it by hand it will be a challenge. This is now my go to. I asked my family today what they wanted on the cake and everyone chose this icing. Thank you!

this recipe is AMAZING, I don't know why it's not rated better. But boy am I glad I read the comments before making this. I took someone's tip and mixed the boiling water in LAST.  I had no need to be nervous because after 10 minutes of high power beating, the icing formed into white fluffy goodness. I did however add about a tablespoon of corn syrup to thicken it a little more. I made this for frosting a single layer Angel food cake. It was delicious and there is still some frosting left over!!

Wow! This is amazing icing. I followed the recipe and affirm the other five-star reviewers. The key to this icing is the beating. It looks brown and awful when you start, but it ends up white-white, and shines and handles with ease. I like it so much better than traditional confectioner’s sugar icing. Less sweet and much whiter when you want white icing. Followed the recipe exactly. I used a stand mixer with the whisk attachment as recommended by another reviewer, and beat it a long time until the peaks formed. Then, it spread beautifully.

Is a great and easy recipe. Put on a 9x13 cake icing was decent next day. Had some left put in freezer, had a few extra cupcakes that had been in freezer, pulled icing out took a few minuets to thaw and was just as good as when I made in early July.

So good! If you made it and it wasn't good...try again! Most likely if it was not good it was you and not the recipe. I have made this numerous times and always get compliments. SO GOOD! I do not like most icing because it is too sweet and thick. This is like a cloud!

This whipped up nicely and the flavor is good, but the sugar didn't dissolve so there are crunchy bits in it.  I hope that was just a fluke, so I shall try it again.  I added a tsp of Toasted Marshmallow flavored Torani syrup and used this to frost a banana cake.

Love this recipe. I realized after making it that it is the same frosting my gma used to put on her Angel Food cake.  
I just put all the ingredients in my Kitchenaid stand mixer on high with the whisk and beat it for about 10 minutes. It came out amazing!!!!

It wasn't getting thick at all, even after long mixing. I think it calls for too much water. I fixed mine buy adding two more egg whites and bam! It thicken and it was good. I will use less sugar next time , as it tasted too sweet for my liking.

Put everything in bowl of stand mixer including boiling water-must be bubbling hot water- cut a hole out of paper plate for a shield for bowl to prevent splatter, set on high walked away for 8 minutes.  Came back to perfect icing.  Wonderful recipe.  Makes a big bowl.

I really liked this frosting. This is a nice change from the super sweet butter and confectioners sugar recipes. I used egg white powder (mixed with water per the directions on the can) and 1/2 tsp of lemon juice instead of cream of tartar. It took about 5 minutes (in the stand mixer with the whisk attachment) to get nice and fluffy. The leftover cake has been covered on the counter for over 24 hours with no change in texture. For those who had trouble with this recipe: be sure to use clean beaters or whisk and metal or glass bowl ( not plastic ). Be careful separating the egg whites. Even a tiny bit of fat or yoke in the whites will make it impossible to whip them to their fluffy best. Try this! It's a really good frosting!

This is an excellent frosting.   The instructions lead you to believe you mix all ingredients then whip. This won't work! I treated this recipie just like I was making merengue.  Whip the egg white on high speed until they begin to stiffen then add the cream of tarter and then the sugar one tablespoon at a time. Whip until you have stiff peaks, then add the vanilla and finally the boiling water.  Once the water has been added it breaks the consistency back down to a thick soup. Don't panic, just keep whipping on high speed. It takes a few minuets but it will stiffen up.  Being a skeptic I made a double batch thinking the original recipie wouldn't cover a cake. Uh... yeah it's plenty. Not one to be wasteful, my daughter took the extra, dropped spoonfuls on a cookie sheet and baked for 45 min at 250 degree. It makes a pretty good cookie.

I made it as is and added food coloring. Not sure but it tasted weird. In the South, we'd call it wangy. Maybe the food coloring? Consistency was nice though.

It tasted good, but the sugar didn't melt completely so it crunched a bit. 
I used this for a dozen cupcakes and had tones of leftovers (I made 1 batch).

The instructions are WAY off. It was complete liquid even after beating it for about 10 minutes. And the taste wasn't even good.

I made a strawberry cake then discovered that I didn't have enough powdered sugar to make my icing so I thought that I would look on All Recipes to see what other icing recipes were out there. I decided to try this one since I had all the ingredients (except the cream of tartar).  This was very easy to make.  I mixed the sugar, egg white, and 1/4 tsp. salt together and then added the hot water and 1 tsp. almond extract.  I had to beat it for 35 minutes! The recipe made a lot of icing but I put it all on my cake because it is so delicious!!!  Would definitely use this recipe again despite having to beat it for so long.

I don't know whether it was the egg white in a carton that I used or the cream of tartar, but it has a very artificial taste to it, and it took absolutely forever to whip this up. Still it did not have the very stiff peaks that I knew it was supposed to have. My granny made boiled icing with a hand cranked mixer and I can't imagine her whipping for so long!
Also adding chocolate does not work - had to throw the first batch out, since it would not stiffen.
This is for a birthday cake - have a feeling I may scrap it off and go with a butter cream. Very disappointing.

Just made it today for my daughters birthday cake.  It was simple to do with my new Kitchenaid stand mixer.  I used their recipe last night to make the cake.  Only took a few minutes from start to finish to make the peaks.  I mixed the sugar, egg and cream of tartar sauce first like someone else mentioned then added the hot water, (Heated in the microwave then let sit for a bit)and vanilla.  Tastes nice.  I sprinkled a little cocoa poweder on top because it looked just way too white for me. :)

I tried this recipe and it did not work out for me very well. I used a standing mixer and mixed for about 8 minutes. I didnt see peaks. It was very difficult to see a thick consistansy. I was dissapointed in this recipe.

This frosting is so fluffy and creamy that my whole family eats it from the bowl I frost banana cake with it and it is amazing. I get tired of the buttercream frostings. This is nice and light--perfect for a summer cake!

didn't care for this at all. I had it in the stand mixer for over half an hour and it was still runny and gritty. I even added more cream of tartar and an extra egg white and it still didn't thicken. finally i added a whole bag of icing sugar to it and now it's thick enough to ice the cupcakes. won't use it again.

I made this (no cream of tartar, just salt), I accidentally doubled the water, and didn't realize it for a while, so then I just added the rest of the ingredients to make it a double batch.  It whipped up nicely (in my stand mixer, no way I would want to do it any other way) but I put it in a Ziploc so that I could ice my cake the next morning at school, and by the next day a lot of liquid had separated.  It was still delicious, but the texture was lost.  So I would say that if you're going to be able to make the icing and serve the cake shortly thereafter, this is great, but if you have to make it ahead of time, find another recipe...

Wow, I had an extremely hard time with this recipe, I followed another reviewer that also didn't have cream of tartar and used salt....big mistake my husband and I were whipping this by hand for over 2 hours, I was determined to make it work. I admit I didn't have the proper ingredients but I am unsure how this recipe worked for others without all the ingredients as well. I did substitute, finally lemon juice and it worked great, had a hint of lemon flavor but nice! The cream of tartar is actually very important because it supports the egg whites, which I did not know. So, hopefully you won't make the same mistake I made and use salt and hours of time! I recommend a hand mixer or stand mixer unless you want a true workout! The icing is very light and fluffy but doesn't hold well in room temp. I put mine in the freezer to keep from running off the cookies.  I will attempt again with the full ingredients!

To be honest  I could not get this icing to set. I tried the icing twice. First time following the instructions exactly and it would not set. I dumped it and tried again adding the sugar, egg white, vanilla, tartar and water first. I started to beat using my mixer and it started thicken, added the vanilla slowly and could not get the more than half the bowl to form a soft whipped cream texture.

This frosting tastes amazing- it tastes like marshmallows! It took me awhile to get it fluffy, and it never did get stiff. It got goopy, but it does taste excellent!

I made this recipe with a container of egg whites (rather than an actual egg white) and splenda it was awful and fake tasting. I can't comment on the actual recipe but don't make the substitutions that I did cause they were bad.

This didn't come to peaks for me either. I added the boiling water last. 30 minutes with the mixer/whisk.  Three stars are for (1) it did turn beautiful white (in case you're worried about the brown mess), (2) it tasted nice, light and vanilla-y, and (3) it probably would have been perfect as a glaze drizzled over a bundt cake or something similar. It would have been usable if we weren't trying to ice cookies. :)

This would be a nice glaze for angel food cake. It is a lite marshmallow taste. It was not fluffy at all. I beat it and whipped it for 1/2 hour!! with a heavy duty kitchen aid. I used it and put cake in the refrigerator in hopes it sets. I will keep searching for the perfect icing....

Great frosting.  We used it on a lemon cake.  Next time I would cut back on the vanilla.  I use real vanilla and the flavor was a bit strong.

Wonderful!  I used mint with the vanilla.  I used 1 tsp mint but it was way too much.  Next time I'll just use 1/4 tsp.  I plan to use it for a Chocolate cake.  I used my kitchen aid with the wire whisk.  I also used two egg whites because I have small farm eggs.  I added everything but the water mixed for a minute full speed then poured in the water and returned to full speed for 10-15 minutes.  Turned out really creamy and fluffy.  Thanks!

My family and I didn't care for this - not what we're used to for frosting.  This tasted more like a cross between meringue and marshmallows.
