This was a huge hit! -- It was demolished in minutes.  The preparation was very easy, but stuffing the bread was very messy -- I sent many guests home with this recipe!

Very disappointed. Made for a small get together. We were all trying out new recipes, all snack or appetizers. I pick this as it sounded really good and had a 5 star rating. Very blah, needs something. The bread became very soggy from the mixture.

This was good, right from the oven.  Was not as appealing later, as it got soggy.

This was delicious and very easy to make.  My family just loved it.  Will definitely make this one again...soon.
