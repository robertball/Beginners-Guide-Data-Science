Maybe I did something wrong or perhaps its my taste, but 8 cups of liquid just did not make it...at least with a whole 12 oz package of noodles.  Once I added the noodles, the liquid was basically all gone...and I ended up adding chicken broth I had on hand to at least keep it simmerable for two hours.  Tasted great though and very easy, ingredients are usually ones you have on hand and with two kids with the flu, I was happy to have found it.  I think its a great simple recipe to try but I wouldn't add ALL the noodles at once till you're comfortable with the amount of liquid in the soup.

I used half chicken broth and half water.  I let the veggies cook 15 min then added raw chopped up chicken breats to make it's own broth.  Let that cook about 20 min then tossed in the noodles for the last ten minutes.  It was wonderful.  Added some parsley and salt and pepper too.

I have only made chicken noodle soup a couple of times.  I saw this recipe and read the reviews and decided to make it.  I had to make so many changes, I should have wrote my own recipe.  First of all there isn't enough liquid for the amount of ingredients.  I used 12 cups of liquid and the amount of chicken bouillon accordingly.  I cooked the vegetables in the broth.  I cooked the chicken seperately.  It was bland to say the least.  I then added a few bay leaves, some dried oregano and basil, poultry seasoning and lots of black pepper.  I added the chicken back and simmered for about 15 minutes.  I cooked only 6 ounces of the egg noodles, which was more than enough. I added the noodles at the end to keep them from being mushy.  My soup at this point was delicious and got rave reviews.  Just a note... it doesn't take 2 hours of simmering to be done.  Mine was done in half the time.

I gave it four stars because it needed some modification. Use 8c chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cubes, the taste is MUCH better that way. Also, I added some parsley, salt and pepper. 
I also do this in the crock pot. I add everything but the noodles and cook it on low all day. Makes the house smell WONDERFUL! Then I switch the crock pot to high and add the noodles (half what the recipe calls for, 12oz is waaay too much)about an hour before serving.

Very good, but I agree that it needs a little more seasoning.  Chicken broth instead of water helps boost the flavor, and I added some parsley, salt and pepper.  NOTE:  I always cook my noodles separately and add them to soup--keeps the starch from affecting the flavor.  All in all, a good soup for the winter season.

Recipes was great but needed to add Broth/water to my soup after 30 minutes of cooking.The noodles soaked up all my juice. Recommend adding the noodles in the last 20 minutes of cooking. Tasted great though. Thanks.

This was an easy recipe.  There was way to many noodles for the amount of water.  I would cut the noodles in half next time.

Nice recipe for a single guy like me.
After adjusting the water and noodles, I freeze in 2 cup portions.  Reheat frozen portions for a quick, cheap and tasty meal.  Oh yea, add white pepper! yum.

The soup tasted great, but I had to add about 4 more cups of water and more chicken broth, and I didn't even put in all the noodles that the recipie called for.  But it turned out fine, and it was really easy to make!!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because as it is presented it is lacking liquid and spices.  However, I liked the idea of using boneless chicken breasts instead of having to remove chicken from the bone.  I altered the following ingredients for an excellent result: I used 1 addt'l chicken breast half, substituted the water and bouillon for 16 cups chicken broth, decreased the egg noodles to only 8 oz, and added 2 bay leaves, 2 tsp oregano, 2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, and a 1/4 tsp pepper.  I also did not add the egg noodles until 20 minutes before serving.

I would put in white rice, mushrooms, and celery to add more flavor. Sea salt and pepper adds a certain spice to it that I personally like.

As others have mentioned, this recipe is a great starting point.  I used kitchen shears to cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces, then I boiled those (to help it cook more quickly).  I added 1 tsp poultry seasoning, 1 tsp parsley, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a little bit of black pepper.  I used 6 ounces of noodles, and that was almost too much.  I used the small shell pasta, because that is what I had on hand.  It still turned out fantastically!  My two toddlers gobbled it all up.

This recipe was pretty good.  I ended up having to add 1 1/2 cups water as it was cooking.  The noodles just seemed to suck up all the liquid.  And a word to the wise....this does not freeze well.  I would prepare this soup again.

I like this recipe because it is much easier to cook chicken breasts than to cook the whole bird! Then I only simmered for about 45 minutes. And as other suggested added a reduced amount of noodles with about 15 minutes left to cook. I also added corn. Perfect for a cold winter night!

This was very easy to make, but 2 hours was way too long to simmer!  The noodles were so mushy they fell apart.  I used seasoned bouillon granules for a little extra flavor, and only simmered for an hour, and it was perfect!

WOW!!  Way, way, way too many noodles. I removed at least half and there were still too many. I added a lot of salt, pepper, spices.  Once I doctored it up it tasted okay.

Drain the chicken juice?? You mean throw it out?? Oh my NO!! That should be used as stock for the soup. I boil my chicken in water with onion, salt and pepper then strain the juice into your soup kettle. Pick out the chicken,dice up and save until the soup is ready. Go ahead and add the carrots, celery more onion, etc. The chicken won't become tough and stringy if you add it back later.

I love this recipe.  It's quick, it's something I can throw on the stove after work and jump in the shower.  It does require a few modifications.  For instance, always plan on adding two extra cups of water and two extra chicken cubes.  However, I've found that if you put your onion, celery, and carrots into a food processor, you need to add very little extra seasoning.  I also make sure to use a white onion.  I've found this way even my little brother, who hates cooked carrots and onions, will eat it.

I had this crazy idea of inviting my family over for chicken soup instead of having a normal house warming party.  Decided to try this recipe it really is simple and easy to make. I also changed the recipe a little though.  I used raw diced up chicken for the extra flavor and the richness from the little bit of fat in it. I also threw a bay leaf (mom said so) and some fresh parsley in.  I used the classic lipton style noodles for the soup. I had to triple the recipe since i have a large family and noticed i didn't need as much carrot and celery as stated but with alot of extra water it turned out great. I ended up with 2 army sized pots full of soup and it was definatly a hit because there is not a single bowl leftover.

This is a good start recipe.  Instead of boneless breasts I used boned and boiled the meat off and skin it helps to add that chicken flavor and about 2 teaspoons of chicken flavor.  After the chicken is cooked and deboned then I added the extras.  It isn't too hard to see the water level is low and simply added a bit as needed.  I found adding a bit after the noodles cooked stopped the soggyness.  It's a good start recipe.  It doens't hurt to salt and pepper the chicken as it's boilling down.

It definetly was the recipe i was looking for in regards to ease.

Added 1 tablespoon of thyme salt and pepper. Noodles were mushy had to add 2 more cups of water.
 Good flavor next time I will cook the noodles for 20 min. then add before serving

I made this soup with pheasant and quail. I added a little fresh nutmeg to go with the wild taste. With the fresh veggies, garlic and onion a slow simmer hid or deleted the gamey taste of the meat. Very good.

Easy to make but lacking in some flavor. Needed pepper and garlic. I also added dill and some of the celery leaves from the top of the stalks while it simmered (old tricks from my grandmother) OK but I think I will stick with my Grandma's way.

This recipe is for someone who likes a lot of 'stuff' in their soup and not a lot of broth.  Since I have broth lovers I had to supplement a LOT with some homemade chicken stock and white wine.  It is mild (i.e. bland) but nothing that a little bit of garlic and parsley wouldn't fix.  Solid basic recipe to build off of to adjust to family tastes.

Made this recipe an was so happy with the taste an smell of soup . I changed one little thing an that was in noodles , I used cooked egg noodles . Cooked the noodles just to Al'dente so that when you added the noodles to the soup they would finish cooking with the rest of soup an soak up the flavor of the soup .

This is a good basic soup especially for when I am feeling sick -- it is easy to prepare, and easy to eat.  READ THE REVIEWS FIRST for ideas to make this really great. Excellent for a first time making home made soup, if you take tips from others. Cook noodles in a separate pot of water or broth. Then you can add them to each bowl of soup when you serve, or put them all into the soup when ready to serve. That way you can decide how much noodle to add.  If you are not comfortable playing around with ingredients, just start with what is given (omitting  two carrots and two celery stalks, and add cooked noodles to serve). It's pretty good and very easy.

I tweaked the recipe as well after reading reviews. This was my first time making Chicken soup and I think it turned out well. Use chicken broth instead, with 2 cup water. 5 carrots, 5 stalks celery, 3/4 whole onion and a little less than 1/2 Pkg of noodles. Since I didn't have bouillon cubes I used poultry seasons, pepper to taste. Not bad for my first time. Think if I had of follow like the recipe it would have been too much. My husband doesn't care for carrots to begin with, we both were sick and I heard chicken soup is good for you when you have a cold.
