I added this recipe to my Christmas cookie list.  I made them early though and they are wonderful.  Very moist.  Thanks for sharing.  This one is a keeper.

I hate leaving low stars but this recipe leaves one wanting.  The potential for a delicious cookie is there, given the ingredients, but the result misses the boat.  The cookies turned out surprisingly bland; the spices definitely need to be upped, or perhaps an addition of finely diced apples or ginger would give a kick.  Also, the texture is a bit too spongy for my liking.  This recipe pales in comparison to other autumn spice cookies and is not a keeper.

Will definitely make it again....my 3  little  grandsons ( 5,6, &9) all loved them...the 6 yr old asked if I could give recipe to " mommy".  Easy to make...I used homemade applesauce in mine. Made about 2 1/2 dozen.

These cookies were a hit at Christmas! They stayed fluffy, moist and delicious. My two year old loved them along with my 90 year old grandparents. They are almost guilt free!

These don't spread and you end up with round little cookies.  Perhaps if you used butter they would spread.  I used my large cookie scoop and ended up with round little cookies and about 4 3/4 dozen of them (I increased the recipe by half).  They aren't bad--a sweet, basic cookie.  I used dried cranberries and a dried fruit mixture since I'm out of raisins.  Thanks for the recipe!

When I first printed this recipe it stated that the yield was 60 cookies.  I got 28 cookies that are 1 1/2 inches wide.  The directions don't tell you when to add the raisins or walnuts.  Recipes should be complete and accurate if they are posted
