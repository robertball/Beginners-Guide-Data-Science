I served this on New Year's Eve and my family loved it.  I did take the advice of one reviewer and heated the filling in a saucepan before putting in the bread bowl.  I then baked the filled bread for about 30-35 minutes.

I have made this recipes several times.  I followed the recipe this first time after that I decided that it needed a "little more spice" so I added some diced jalapeno peppers to it and everyone loved it.  Must be careful to not add to many!!!  I also put it a small crock pot so that it stays hot for the night.

This dip is addictive. It did take much longer than an hour to heat up though. Next time, might try to heat up dip first then put in bread bowl. Also used olive oil instead of vegetable to toast bread. Mmm Mmm good.

Everyone loved this recipe. I did substitute 1/2 lb. of bacon for the ham. Also, it seemed to take a very long time to bake but I will just have to remember that for next time (because there will definitely be a next time). I used the bread from 2 round loaves and still didn't have enough for all of the dip so I would suggest having crackers on hand also or else a LOT of bread. You won't have any leftovers here!

This was pretty good!  We followed the directions, except leaving out the ham and using a 1 1/2 pound oval loaf of bread.  It is NOT like a fondu however, as the name states.  It is pretty thick, even after 90 minutes in the oven almost like a cheese spread.  So don't expect it to be the same as a fondu.  We could not finish it in one day and it heats just as well the second day.  Also dipped some carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower in it.

This was really easy & yummy but a little inconvenient if you're making this with other appetizers as it requires first nuking the ingredients,then baking in the oven as baking alone will not heat/melt the dip.The toasted bread cubes were awesome7 a great idea to serve with any dip.

Wow. I can't believe this hasn't been tried and adored by more folks.

I made this for Christmas Day. I doubled the recipe and put the rest in an oven safe dish. It was devoured VERY quickly by my family. A Sure Fire Hit!!!

I skipped the ham and peppers, and put in shrimp (the small salad size).  I had SO many raves about this, I'm REQUIRED to make a minimum of 2 bread bowls per family gathering!!

I made this in the microwave and then served it in a mini-crockpot to avoid the stated problem of it taking too long in the oven.  People stood around the crockpot dipping the toasted bread and tortilla chips in it, ignoring most of the other offerings at the party.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Definitely takes longer than an hour to cook, but it's worth it. Next time I make this, I'm preheating the filling. But there WILL be a next time, my girlfriend went nuts over this! I also substituted bacon for ham, just because bacon tastes soooo much better than ham in everything.
We dipped bread and little chunks of salami into this, delicious!

I loved this! I actually can't say enough good things about it.  I made my own loaf of bread to use as a bread bowl for a party and served this in it.  I substituted chopped up jalapenos for the green chiles.  I used a canned ham because I didn't have a real ham around.  It was amazing.  Everyone loved it.  I think I'm going to make this for every party we have from now on.

I make this recipe at every gathering and am aksed for the recipie every time! The only changes I make are to omit the green onions and I don't toast the bread.  Taking a tip from other reviewers, I recently started making it in the crock pot instead of the bread bowl so it would stay hot all night.

This was quite good.....i left out the ham because i'm not a fan of it, and it was still delicious. Next time i make it however, i'm going to use less of the onion and add some more cheese, and maybe a but less cream cheese so its not as thick. Definately on the rich side....but I thought it was great!!! Will DEFINATELY make again!!! (my boyfriend loved it)

It's very good, I love the combination of all the ingredients.  It did take longer to cook; about 1 hour 30 minutes to get all of the cheese to melt, but once done, it was a hit.  We have it regularly.

Made 2 of these for the holidays, one with ham and the other with shrimp.  They were definitely a hit with the family.  Did find that it took forever for the dip to melt, but was well worth the wait.  Thanks!

This is delicious. I had to bake mine a little longer, though. It was still kind of cold in the center after one hour. I used the one pound Hawaiian Sweet Loaf. Excellent recipe!

My guests loved this.  However, I didn't put it in a bread bowl, and it was a little greasy.  I think it needs to be in a bread bowl to soak up the extra oil and butter, otherwise, I'd leave those ingredients out.

Made this for New Year's Eve with left over ham.  It was wonderful!  I used a crusty bread and forgot about the cubes in the oven - thought they were going to be too crunchy, but they were perfect.  Two thumbs up for this one

We did this as part of our Fondue meal at Christmas and it was a hit.  I have to say, we did cook it longer per the other reviews.  My husband has been requesting this since, so I'm doing it for a Super Bowl party!  Go Bucs!!

I made this for Christmas day, and it went over fantastic with kids and adults. Its easy, hearty, very tasty and not messy, and no dishes to bring home. I mixed it by hand rather than with a spoon etc. I did cook it for about an hour and a half. Very southwesterny flavour. Would also be good with bacon instead of ham. A definate hit!! Making it again for new years.

This got rave reviews at our Christmas party.  I took an earlier suggestion and pre-cooked the dip a bit on the stove before baking it(just to melt everything), and it seemed to do the trick.  After an hour it was perfect.
I also bought a second loaf just for dipping pieces and I'm glad I did.  One loaf just doesn't ever offer enough pieces.  Toasting the bread is key.

It was very tasty, but it had to stay in the oven a lot longer that 60-70 mins. So put in oven if expecting guests to arrive within ah hour ..ready to eat.

I just made this for New Years Eve and it was great with a couple of tweaks. I added extra cheddar cheese and sour cream. I also added 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes, juice and all. This made a great difference in taste. It made the consistency more like a dip than a spread and it added some needed flavor. I used a pound of bacon instead of the ham. The toasted bread was a great addition! My kids also ate it with tortilla chips.

I have made a version of this for years.  No ham or meat at all.  I use low fat sour cream and cream cheese.  And instead of diced chili peppers and Worcestershire, I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup or more of my favorite salsa.  I make additional toasted bread cubes using an additional french loaf.  Also, if you make ahead and in the frig, it nees longer than one hour to cook.

Very good, I halved the recipe and it still made tons.  I also heated everything on the stovetop before adding it to my bread bowl.

I cooked this in a casserole dish and added to bread bowl afterwards. I toasted the cut up bread chunks in the oven after I sprayed them with spray-magerine and sprinkle them with seasoned salt. Yummmmmm! Everyone LOVE it!! :o)

This is incredible!!!  First off - its a dip/spread NOT fondue.  I reduced the sour cream and cream cheese and added Velveeta but I did not have "fondue-type" consistency.  However, it was delicious!!!  We used everything - bread, tortilla chips, pretzels... the chiles gave it a great spice and we even put a little garlic salt on our bread pieces while they were in the oven.  YUM!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Oh my goodness!!!!  This was awesome.  I was short on time so I melted everything on the stove in a saucepan, but it was still awesome.  I can't even imagine how great it would have been if I had the time to do it as directions ask.

This is a great appetizer.  I have made it several times and it is always gone.  It's not the consistency of a traditional fondue and it is more like a hot spread.  I may try it in my small crockpot next time.

It was ok tasting,my big problem with it was there was too much cream cheese so it was never really a dipping consistancy.It's more like a hot spread.
I'll try this again with much less cream cheese and see how it turns out.

This was just OK.  I like quality, restaraunt style cheesy fondue.  This had too much cream cheese and sour cream, not enough cheese.  It was OK, but not a high quality dish.  I wasn't impressed.

This is an AWESOME recipe. I made it for a party a few days ago. I have a couple of picky eaters in my family and believe it or not.. they were the ones who asked me for the recipe. I did omit the chilie peppers and put in just a FEW jalapeno peppers...(that is what I had on hand.) I used the hawaiian bread because I couldn't find regular round loaf bread. It still came out great!! I will  definately make it again..

This is wonderful.  This is a great recipe and is widely enjoyed.  I've also eaten it with crumbled bacon and with both ham and bacon.  I've always found that it takes considerably longer to heat throroughly in my oven (which admittedly cooks a little slower).  This is great -- if you haven't tried it yet, you must give it a chance.

I HAVE MADE THIS NOW THREE TIMES AND IT IS WONDERFUL! I HATE ANYTHING SPICY AND I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS SPICY AT ALL. MY KIDS LOVE IT. I DID HAVE TO BAKE IT LONGER THAN 1 HOUR. I JUST STUCK IT IN THE MICROWAVE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND IT WAS WONDERFUL.

This was a pretty good recipe (sorry for the terrible photo - I tried, I really did but its a hard one to capture).  You do have to heat the filling before baking it or it would never heat all the way thru before the bread would dry out.  I don't think this is a "company recipe".  Its kind of hard to eat gracefully (kind of like BBQ ribs), but the flavors were good.  Next time, I might skip the bread bowl baking concept and just heat it in a crock pot or fondue pot.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

SOOOO YUMMY!  A favorite for SuperBowl Sunday.  Check center of dip to make sure it is warm, before serving.  I have to cook it longer than recommended to get the center warm.  Definetly better warm than cold, but really good still good cold.

Let me start off by saying that I omitted the ham and worschestire sauce to make this vegetarian. As per other reviewers I melted the dip ingredients in a saucepan for 30 min. before filling the bread and putting it in the oven. This was pretty good...I think some changes would help make it even better though. Less cream cheese and more cheddar is where I would start...it is VERY rich if you follow the recipe as written. Second, I am not sure about the green chiles. They give it a great spicy flavour...but I found it ended up tasting like that cheese salsa you buy in a jar to dip nacho chips in. Good, but not what I was expecting. Even though I have some critiques I still really enjoyed this recipe and I look forward to tweaking it in the future.

To earn a recognition as Cadette Girl Scouts, my troop had to create a meal for the four of us for a Thanksgiving dinner. I made one of these as an appetizer and it was devoured by all. I reccommend doubling the filling be cause with a lot of people(or just four Girl Scouts) it just disappears.

Very rich, this is a good thing. I added a little garlic. It still tasted a little bland. Overall I would make it again.

I took this to a shower, no one tried it. It sounds great but very bland. It could be improved but it was missing something. I would definitely recommend trying at home if you plan on taking it to a party.

Everyone liked this recipe.  I left out the ham because I had another appetizer with ham.  I also added more green chili peppers and a can of drained Rotel tomatoes.

I was really excited about this recipe. It has great potential. I omitted one pkg of cream cheese and the peppers. I felt it was still really rich. I tried warming the filling first and baking for 1hr 20mins didnt do it. Maybe it needed to be warmer? I would add more real cheese next time. But we found the bread bowl to be plenty of bread for dipping.

This was really good.  Made it for New Years Eve and we just loved it.  I followed the directions completely, although I did not toast the reserved bread.  We did need extra bread for dipping as suggested by many others.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Made no changes to ingredients and it was YUMMY!  A chef asked for my recipe!  It did take considerably more time to heat up, and I bought an extra loaf of bread for dipping.  I'll make again and again... we'll worth the wait!

This recipe is delicious! I doubled the recipe to take to a fondue party and it was all gone! Wonderfully creamy and very cheesy, I used a combination of colby, monterey jack, and cheddar. I was a bit nervous because it definitely doesn't resemble your traditional fondue but it got rave reviews. Makes a wonderful dip for any occasion.

I made this with Hawiian round bread in the orange wrapper & baked it for 2 hours or more in foil.  It smelled better than it tastes-too rich & too heavy.

I had some friends over recently and had a buffet table set up with plenty of appetizers, this one was gone in no time flat. They all loved it and asked for the recipe to share with thier families.

I have made this many times and it is the hit of the party.  Don't knock yourself out though...I use a jar of dried beef instead of the ham, and if you are pressed for time, my husband likes to dip fritos in it.  Also, leave out the chilies to make it kid friendly....just as good!

None of the kids liked it, but the adults liked the extra "kick" the green chiles gave.
