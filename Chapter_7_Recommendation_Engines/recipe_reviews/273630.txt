I really loved the flavor combo in these. They were not spicy at all so don't let that scare you off. My chops were thick and still got a little overdone so I recommend checking that after 20 minutes. This is a great recipe for chops and one I will use again.

This was good although there wasn’t nearly enough spice for me. Next time I’ll try to add some additional spice to it. It was also difficult to cook it without the cheese sticking to the pan.

It was good. I had relatively thin pork chops, about an inch thick, and by 25 minutes in the oven they were overdone. I would recommend 20 minutes baking next time. I was surprised that the "breading" had a good lime and cheese flavor. Easy to make.

Very nice. I made adjustments to cooking time since my chops weren’t so thick. I also didn’t add the cheese until after the chips were fried and baked. I added some diced jalapeños before baking. We like them!
