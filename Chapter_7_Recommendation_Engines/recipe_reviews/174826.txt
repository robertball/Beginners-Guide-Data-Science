Our family loves tres leches cake.  This is a quick way to make one.  This is not a very "wet" cake if you like it really soaked in milks.  And I agree with others...tres leches cake needs to be topped with real whipped cream (not cool whip, not frosting).  Buy 1 pint of whipping cream, use 1 cup for the recipe and whip the rest.  Add a touch of vanilla and a sprinkle of powdered sugar and frost.  A pint will be exact amount for recipe ingredients plus whipping.  My husband is Mexican and says it is as delicious as his family's favorite bakery, if not better.

MMMMMMMMM, is all I can say about this cake!!  I made the cake part as written, but changed up the 'milks' a bit to get a more "wet" cake.  I used one whole can of evaporated milk, plus one can of sweetened condensed milk plus 1 cup of half and half, plus one tsp vanilla.  I also frosted the cake with sweetened whipped cream (1 1/2 Cups whipping cream plus 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and about 3 or 4 Tbs conf sugar)   This is quite possibly one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  And really quick and easy too!

Using the frosting overwhelmed the tres leche flavor.

This is a very simple recipe and quite tasty too! However, I do prefer the cake to be topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit rather than the suggested whipped frosting. All in all it's a great recipe sure to be enjoyed.

I used to buy an authentic tres leches cake from a girl I worked with in a mexican restaurant. My family just loved it. When my daughters birthday came around she wanted one so I thought I'd give it a try myself. I found this easy recipe and will forever make my own. The only differeces I made were: instead of using "heavy whipping cream" I used regular milk; instead of using "ready made frosting" I used a ready made whipped cream (like cool whip). I cooked the cake (mix) using the round pan option, then I soaked the bottem layer and spread whipped cream and layered fresh strawberries on top, after that I put the second layer on and poured the rest of the milk mixture on. I let the whole thing soak overnight. Before serving I "frosted" with whipped cream and decorated it with fresh/sliced strawberries (check out my pic! It's the one with the "18") Everyone ate it and complained they only got one piece!

This recipe is slightly wrong.  The topping should be freshly whipped cream.  I always add fruit such as peaches, strawberries, or pineapple inside the cake and a few on top.  When making it for kids I use marschino cherries.

This cake is AMAZING.  The fact that you can use cake mix is a huge time saver as well.  I made this for new years and got rave reviews from friends.  The cake is so moist and delicious and so easy to make-it's even good without the frosting.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a latino girl's birthday celebration and she thought that it was good...not quite as nice as the kind she gets in her home country but it hit the spot.

This cake turned out FANTASTIC! I can't see any reason not to use the suggested yellow cake mix rather than make one from scratch. We have been buying them from our local mexican bakery and this is easily as good. I agree that the whipped cream must be substituted for a canned frosting, thats the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars. I made the cake the evening before the party, poured in the liquid and refrigerated it until ready to serve, thats when we topped it with the lightly sweetened whipped cream and halved strawberries. I didn't find this recipe to be too dry, just right in our opinion. Wonderful!

This was very good,even my boyfriend thought so and he is mexican! The only thing I would do differently is double the milk. I used 2 round cake pans and my 3 year old ate half of one before they cooled so I used all the milk the recipe called for on half the cake and it was just right so I think it would be to dry if I had made the whole cake.

I really like this recipe. I like that it uses a cake mix for two reasons: 1. I love the taste of yellow cake mix 2. It's so much easier to make. I added extra milk so it was more moist, and I made the whipping cream from scratch. I also like to add flavor to the whipping cream (i.e. jello strawberry mix, etc.).

This recipe was a hit.  Delicious, I tripled this recipe since the cake was gonna be for a party and I needed to make enough cake.  Will make it again but next time try it with strawberries.

Very good recipe.  Extremely easy for those of us who don't want to spend a lot of time.  I never add the frosting, it would be WAY to rich!

When I made this I used the whole small carton of whipping cream, and cans of both evaporated milk and condensed milk.  Also added strawberries to to the top after it was frosted.  Delicious, I won't buy it premade ever again.

I've made this several times for parties and it is a BIG hit.  It's delicious.  I use Cool Whip for the frosting as other readers have recommended although one of these days I will try real whip cream.

I had never made a cake before and came across this recipe when I decided to make one spur of the moment for my boyfriend's birthday. It tasted great and was easy to make. I didn't use the frosting though. Instead I made a raspberry and strawberry sauce. It went well! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My family loves this so much we've tried several variations.  My family likes a thin layer of frosting rather than the authentic whipped cream.  My fiance likes to add a little different flavor by using a flavored cake.  I took the advice of adding a little more milk as another reviewer suggested.  But all in all this is a really easy, delicious cake.

I am going to try this recipe but I usually boil my milks...I was asked to make a 3 tier wedding cake of Tres Leche..so I am going to have to do some trial and error of the milk consistency. I am open to any suggestions.

This is just a great, easy to make recipe. I definetly agree that frosting would be too much for this sweet cake and a light whipped topping with fruit is the way to go. Very delicious!
