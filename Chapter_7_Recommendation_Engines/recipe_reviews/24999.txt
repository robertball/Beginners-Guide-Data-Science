Very easy to make, but just not a very good cake.  Pre-packaged store-bought cake mixes are twice as good.

This was a pretty good cake. I read the reviews before I made it and I added 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder to avoid the runny batter that several others mentioned. The cake was very moist and dense with a great flavor. It made a lovely cake for my sons birthday.

Yes, this cake was easy but did not taste so great.  It IS moist; however, the salt (1 tsp!) can be tasted in cake and cake does not have much rich cake flavor. The batter is runny and my son was bummed he could not lick the beaters. All in all, recipe is "ok." Will not make again though.

I didn't actually make the cake, I used a box mix, but the frosting was very good. We thought it tasted like the glaze on a chocolate krispey creme doughnut.

This is MUCH better than a box cake, by far.  The batter is a bit runny, but the moistness of the cake cannot be beat.  I used this recipe to make cupcakes for work and everybody devoured them.  This recipe will definitely be my number one goto from now on for cakes/cupcakes...

We followed the recipe but I found it was definitely a “lazy daisy”! It was a very thin and crepe like cake. But when I frost it hopefully it’ll be better. The flavor is a little on the eggy side. Idk we’ll see.

This was a hit in our house.  The cake was beautifully moist and had a wonderful texture.  The only change I made was to use 1 1/4 cup flour.  Be sure to boil the sugar, butter and milk before adding the chocolate so you don't get a gritty frosting as I did because I was in a rush.  It was a stupid rookie mistake.

I made this cake per the recipe and my family loves it, everyone always wants me to bring one for family events. I also add 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. It's lights out.  I do however use my own vanilla fudge buttercream frosting.
