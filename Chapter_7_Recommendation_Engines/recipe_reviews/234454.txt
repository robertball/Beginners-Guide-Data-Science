I have made this recipe several time now. I also make them as sandwich buns without the garlic & dill.  I've found that Betty Crocker's gluten free flour works the best. It is more of a batter than a dough, so I use a large spoon to place on the baking sheet. My husband likes these better than store bought gluten free bread.  This isn't as crumbly & has better flavor. This recipe is a keeper!

We are gluten free and have been having a hard time making bread that isn't sticky.  This bread was definitely not sticky and even the gluten eaters loved them!  I left out the dill and just added the garlic--perfection!

I didn't have any dill, so I left it out, but they turned out so good!  My brother, who didn't know they were gluten free, had 2. Thanks so much for the recipe.  I think next time I'm going to try and add cheese for some yummy garlic cheddar biscuits.  These made my thanksgiving even better.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. The consistency was like cake batter so i added another 1/2 cup of bobs redmill gluten free flour. The dough still wouldn't stick together so i turned it into a loaf rather then buns.

The dough ended up being very similar to cake batter, much like some of the others in the comment section. However, I abstained from adding additional flour/xantham gum and added it into both small and large muffin tins. I let the mixture proof for around an hour to an hour and a half. This ended up making nice and fluffy rolls that both I and my family were satisfied with.

Very tasty.  Smelled amazing!  I may let it rise a little longer next time, but overall delicious and filling.  One is enough in one sitting.

Horible - tasted chalky and the ingredients must be off.   Way too much liquid.  After i mixed it, it was like a cake batter.
Added more flour,  still lacked flavor and the right consistency.
Served for a dinner and no one would eat it.

Kind of blah, have to put a lot of butter on 'em. I think they should have been let to rise after forming the biscuits in the pan as mine look like round nuggets, not biscuits. I baked them another 20 minutes and they were still raw in the middle and crusty on the outside. Could be my failure but I think it's because they didn't have a second rise. Don't think I'll try again.

I gave 4 stars because in the end it turned out okay, but it did not work out according to the recipe. I omitted the dill because I didn't have any, but I don't think that impacted the outcome. 

I had to add quite a bit of flour and I still couldn't get it to a stage where it was able to be handle to make biscuits. This also diluted the garlic flavor quite a bit, even though I added more garlic than the recipe called for.

I ended up pouring the "dough" into a loaf pan and it turned out very well, aside from the lack of strong garlic taste. I whipped up some garlic butter to put on it and it was DELICIOUS! 

I'm not sure what went wrong as far as being able to work the dough into biscuits, but I'm going to try this again because it was VERY good in the end. I will add even more garlic and possibly try adding more xanthum gum? to see if that helps without spoiling the flavor.

I made it and also found that it never got to a doughy consistency.  So, I greased muffin tins and poured the batter into the tins.  Turned out just fine!  Looked liked muffins, but tasted like a bread.  Next time I'll increase the flour to 3 or more cups to see if that makes a difference.

These are tasty! I made mine into a loaf,and the slices are a solid surface for cheesy or nutty spreads.
