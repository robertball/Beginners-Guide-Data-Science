I don't like a stiff drink and bartending is  not my expertise. I really liked this fairly sweet cocktail.    The recipe calls for passion fruit.  I used passion fruit juice. I was thinking it might be a typo, but looking close up at the photo it might not be.

I made this awhile back from thebar.  I rated it a 7/10 and thought it was pretty good.  Honestly it didnt taste like an original hurricane.  It was more like a mango hurricane for me.  Seeing it on here reminds me that I need to make it again!

Excellent, easy, and quick - the only thing you'll need to get used to is that it's NOT Red, like the picture, or other processed Hurricanes you'll encounter.  Having said that, it's Delish, and 100% of my samplers have given big thumbs up.  If you're uncomfortable with the "no red" thing, you can add a pinch (like a half cup) of fruit juice. Highly recommended.
