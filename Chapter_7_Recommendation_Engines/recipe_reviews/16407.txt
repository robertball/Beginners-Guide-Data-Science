This sauce was very popular in Alabama. A well known restaurant used it on chicken, and then used the chicken shredded in stuffed baked potatoes! They also served extra sauce on the side to put on top of the baked potatoes.(I used plain vinegar in place of cider vinegar, and marinated the chicken for several hours and then basted the chicken on the grill.)For a quick sandwich or stuffed potato topping put cooked shredded chicken and sauce in a pan,cover and cook down till sauce is almost evaporated.

Following the directions "as-is" yields a very thin sauce.  Since I was planning to use this as a topping to turkey meatloaf, I thickened the mixture up on the stove: I dissolved 2 T flour in 1/4 c milk, then slowly whisked into the sauce at a boil.  It worked well, really had great flavor, and wasn't overpowering as I feared it might be.

I've tried many recipes from this site and were pleased at the results, however this recipe was awful. I followed the recipe to a tee and used it on chicken breasts but the taste was terrible.  The taste of the vinegar was way too strong.  I will not be making this again.

I was skeptical to try this at first, it didn't look very appealing, but I decided to give it a try- and it was good! I gave it 4 stars only because it doesn't smell good, but it TASTES good!

I followed this recipe exact, but nobody wanted it.  My brother in law tried a very little but would not go near it again and said it was bland.  Nobody else would try it.    I'm disappointed.   :o(

The vinegar was way too much; that's all you taste.  I added more mayo (next time I'll reduce vinegar to 1/4 c) and seasonings (seasoning salt, Montreal Chicken seasoning, garlic powder).

I liked this sauce. I used rice vinegar instead and it was nice. I also heated it up and added a little cornstarch to thicken it up. I had it with meatballs and egg noodles. Yummy

This was really good stuff!  It is very simple.  My ten year old wasn't going to try any, because he thought it looked weird.  But I grilled pork chops, and it was quite tasty. 

I figured he would like it, because he likes sweet and sour.  It just sounded strange.

I may substitute olive oil for the mayonnaise next time to make it a little healthier.

I hate to say that this recipe was awful.  I'm from Alabama and love white sauce on grilled chicken, but this just wasn't good.  Way too much vinegar....way to thin.

I tried this recipe last night to a tee cause I've always wanted to try white bbq sauce, anyways, the sause came out really watery and runny, but I tried it on two chicken breast and baked it at 350. The chicken came out really moist, but the taste was bland and there was no real bbq flavor! I was very dissapointed.

Very easy sauce, but this recipe does yield a VERY thin consistency.  As is, the consistency is more like a marinade.  I followed MOMMYMEGGY's recommendation for 2T of flour and 1/4C of milk.  Worked like a charm!  My wife wasn't too keen on the vinegar flavor, so we added 1T of sugar.  Gave it a really nice sweet and sour taste.

I made this recipe exactly. And well, let's say I haven't made anything in a little while that got quite the same mmm noises as this did. I will definitely make more! I roasted chicken with this sauce. I also made garden stuffed baked potatoes and used this sauce in the filling and on top. Worked wonderfully. Thank you for posting.
