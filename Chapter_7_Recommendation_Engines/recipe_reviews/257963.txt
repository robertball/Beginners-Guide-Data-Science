Made this for a pot luck and it worked well.  Easy to make, baking instructions were perfect.  I added black pepper and 4 chopped green onions to the mixture before baking - I think it may have been a tad bland without.

I chose this recipe because it asked for baking mix instead of flour which I had on hand.  I also added sharp cheddar and a little Swiss to the cheeses it called for in the recipe, as well as a few sliced green onions.  This was D Lish!

This is the same recipe I used during the 1980's. I lost it and looked  everywhere for it. It finally showed up on ALLRECIPES.

Super easy to make.  I really like the flavor the green chilis add . However, it still tasted like it was missing something. Next time I will add salt and pepper when mixing . Another thought was to add a half can of rotel and omit the can of green chilis to give it more zest!

This was the perfect meatless dish for us. I halved the recipe and we will eat the leftovers wrapped up in a tortilla. I only had one fresh green chili so I added some green chili salsa. I also had 2 leftover baked potatoes, so I chopped them up and put them in as well.  We can hardly wait for the rest of our Chilies  to come on so we can enjoy it again.

While making this, I also added in some rotel and chopped ham.  I forgot the milk, realized too late and got a little panicky. But it still turned out great. I made these for my folks and they said it was really good. I liked it as well. Maybe next time I make this, I might also try adding in some chopped onions too.
