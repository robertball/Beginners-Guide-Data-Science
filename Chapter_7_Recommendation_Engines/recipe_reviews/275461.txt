9.3.19  Used this today on some steamed carrots with chopped fresh tarragon, and although it tasted pretty good, I didn’t find it remarkably better than preparing stovetop.  In my opinion, the down side to this is having to wash the big Instant Pot® liner, the lid, and the ring for 1 stick of butter.  This certainly did provide browned butter, but I’lll probably stick with doing this stovetop in a small pan with an easy cleanup.

I made this for cheese filled tortellini this evening.  It was perfect! The flavor and smell are amazing!  I was using the crock pot brand pressure cooker with non stick pot and got an error and it didn’t come to pressure, but it was still perfect!  Thanks for figuring this out!

This came out pretty well considering I used an 8 qt  Fagor multicooker. I should have taken the insert out immediately because I think it kept cooking. I may try 1 /2 minutes next time. But all in all, a great success.
