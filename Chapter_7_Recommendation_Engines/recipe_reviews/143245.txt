I really loved this recipe!  However, I did make a few simple changes.  I added about 2 cups of cherries and baked the cake in an 8x8 glass dish which had to be greased and floured.  The cake was beautiful~it was moist and had a slight crunch to the outside.  I mixed up a little milk and confectioners' sugar to make a quick glaze to pour over the top for additional sweetness!  The cake disappeared~we will make this cake again!  Thank you for the recipe!!

A very moist coffe cake bursting with fresh cherries!  I used 2 cups like most of the others suggested.  Instead of oil I used 1/2 c. Land O lakes light butter that I creamed together with the 1 c. of white sugar until light and fluffy.  Then I added each egg one at a time to that mixture followed by the vanilla, and milk and an addition of 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.  I baked mine in a prepared 8x8 glass baking dish (used Pam for baking) and baked it at 350 for 55 minutes.  I topped it with a glaze made from 1 c. of confectioners sugar and 2 Tbsp. of milk.  Next time I might top this with sliced almonds - it's a keeper for cherry season.

Great recipe! I actually made muffins out of the batter instead of making the whole cake. They were a hit...YUM!

I really enjoyed this coffee cake.  I did make it fat free by using applesauce instead of the oil.  I also used egg substitute and it came out almost like a bread pudding consistancy.  Not a whole lot of cherry flavor, maybe next time I'll use some cherry extract instead of the vanilla.  All in all, I'll make this again since the ingredients are readily in my pantry.  Thank you.

The only problem I found with this recipe is that the oven needs to be at 350 degrees rather than 325. I had the cake in for nearly an hour and twenty minutes and it still came out too moist, and fell apart in the middle as soon as we took it out of the pan. A very delicious and simple cake. It took me only about ten-fifteen minutes to put it together and I didn't even have to go to the store to buy any of the ingredients like with many recipes.

I'm probably going to write a novel here, so please bear with me. I made quite a few changes to the recipe. You might want to say I "healthed it up". I used white whole wheat flour, which is a somewhat obscure kind of flour but it is wholegrain without feeling like you're eating a brick. I also used granulated brown sugar and decreased it to 2/3 cup, but the cake was still sweet enough. I replaced the oil completely with unsweetened applesauce. I used only 1 very large egg, and used ricemilk for the milk. Ended up also sprinkling 2 tablespoons of chopped walnuts over the top of the batter before baking, which was really the bottom once I turned the cake out because I used a bundt pan. I kept the cherries at 1 1/2 cups. If you want a cake WITH cherries, follow the recipe guidelines. If you want a cake OF cherries, add more. This was SO moist and flavorful. I might add a streusel topping next time I make it. thanks!

Lovely recipe. We had left over cherries which weren't great eating on its own, so thought we might try putting them into a cake instead. Made a few changes to make recipe a bit healthier: 1. substituted oil with applesauce 2. reduced sugar to 2/3 cup. 3. Used 1/2 cup skim milk and 1/2 cup yoghurt (didn't have enough milk). Used about 1 3/4 cup cherries, and had 1/4 of an apple so chopped that up and added in too. The result was a lovely, moist cake which wasn't too sweet.

I also increased the cherries to two cups and it turned out great. It was a delicious way to use up cherries from our local farmers market. We will definitely make this again.

Made this this morning to use up some sweet cherries I had. Made exactly as written, except I reduced the cherries to 1 cup (all I had). I baked mine at 325 and for 55 minutes, and that was probably 3 or 4 minutes too long in my oven. I'll reduce cook time next time. Also added a simple sugar glaze. It tastes excellent. My whole family loved this!

I have a difficult time baking things without adding chocolate to them, and this one was no exception.  In doing so, I confirmed that I don't like the combination of cinnamon and chocolate. So, the second time I made the recipe I made the following changes: 1. Removed all cinnamon 2. Added half cup semi-sweet choc chips 3. Reduced vanilla to half teaspoon 4. Added half teaspoon almond extract I also used frozen cherries instead of fresh (cut them in half and added them frozen to the batter).  I think this turned out better than the original recipe (though I imagine fresh cherries would be better).  Next time I may try with milk chocolate chips/chunks.

Everyone loved this! It was simple to make, and most of the ingredients are ones most would have already on hand. I did increase the cherries to 2 cups, which I think was perfect. When the cake cooled, I drizzled with conf sugar/milk mixture and sprinkled sliced almonds on top. It was not too sweet and goes great with coffee. I believe the cake may even be better the next day ~ seemed to be more moist the day after. Thanks for the easy, delicious recipe!

This cake is wonderful -  very moist and easy to make!  I'm going to let it cool and drizzle a confectioner's sugar glaze over it.  A wonderful way to use ripe, fresh cherries!  The most important part of the recipe is to flour the cherries.  This prevents them from going to the bottom of the cake!

This is a good recipe!  I made a few modifications:
2 cups fresh tart cherries,
1 1/2 teas. almond extract (no vanilla),
2 cups spelt flour,
3/4 cup honey,
2/3 cup olive oil,
1/2 milk.

I made muffins, not a cake, at 325 degrees for around 35 minutes.  Even when the toothpick came out clean, they still weren't completely done in the center.  I had to put them back in the oven for more baking.  These would be delicious with a topping or glaze, but I wanted to keep them semi-healthy.  :)

Tried this recipe since I had some white cherries that needed used. Had two cups of halved cherries. Used butter instead of oil. Added about a 1/4 tsp of almond extract since I like that flavor with cherries.  Made muffins instead and two small loaves.  Flavor was very nice. Nice crumb. Will make again if I have some fresh cherries to use up.

This was yummy! Simple, not fancy. We love cinnamon and had so many cherries (Queen Anne) from our tree I needed to do something with them and found this. I made it with lots of cherries --over 2 cups, and was also generous with the cinnamon. Baked it at 350 and checked it to make sure it didn't get dry near the end. Made a simple, quick brown sugar glaze (water, brown sugar, vanilla) and threw it on top, served with vanilla ice cream. Nice find, easy and fast! Didn't add much cherry juice --may have been too runny that way.

This coffee cake is so yummy, especially right out of the oven. I was looking for a recipe that used fresh cherries since I had some that were getting pretty ripe and this was the perfect recipe for it.  With the exception of slicing and pitting the cherries, the recipe was pretty easy and no fuss.  The cinnamon and cherries gives the cake a nice sweet flavor that is not overpowering.  Overall, great recipe for those who need a quick way of getting rid of some very ripe fruit.

This cake was fantastic.  Very moist!  I added a little almond extract instead of the cinnamon.  My two teenage girls ate half of it the day I made it!  Also upped the cherries to 2 cups.

Very tender, moist cake.  I made it in a 9 inch glass cake pan, perfectly done in 1 hr.  I used organic coconut oil (it was a gift, never used, saw it in another cherry recipe) and subbed half the white sugar for brown.  I did the glaze, but a streusel topping would probably make this 5 stars.  Yes, I'll make it again, and probably add streusel topping.

Hideous cake recipe! Those that rate it 4-5 stars have all changed it to make it edible. Bland! And I have discovered that cinnamon and cherries do not go well together!

This cake is so moist and delicious! I used more cherries like others have done, whole wheat flour, and canola oil. Also, I put a glaze on top. Quick and easy!
