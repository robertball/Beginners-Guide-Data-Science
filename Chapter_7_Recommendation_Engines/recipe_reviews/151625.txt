After cooking the meatballs, I opened the sub bread, put the meatballs and cheese on top and broiled the sandwich openfaced to make bread nice and crunchy and to melt the cheese.  Very good.

My husband really liked this.  I didn't, but perhaps it was the meatballs that we bought.  It was super easy.

This was so easy and tasted great.  It does make more than enough food for 2 people, but I just made enough for my husband and I and put the rest of the meatballs away.  The sandwiches are really filling.  I would recommend this to someone that wants to make a quick meal with little effort.

This sandwich was delicious and so easy with the store bought meatballs. I used italian style turkey meatballs. My husband's only complaint was that it was too much food.

If you are going to use frozen meatballs, you might as well just buy sub rolls and make a sub. If you want a meatball parmigiano hero, you need to use real, crusty Italian bread and make the meatballs.
