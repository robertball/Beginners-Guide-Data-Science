I can truly call this one a disaster.  It was totally dry and tasteless and I checked my recipe over and over to make sure I added everything in the correct amount.

After reading the reviews, I decided to change the amount of bread crumbs from 4 cups to 2 cups... It worked great! Especially if you are into something with not enough sugar

Per reviews I just put in 2 cups of bread crumbs, extra apple sauce, and in place of milk I used double the amount of a cream liqueur. So it was just moist enough, though not as sweet as I would have liked, but that could've just been the liqueur. Putting coolwhip on top helped. And I think if I ever used this recipe again, I'd want to use more banana, to taste it more.

Wanted this recipe to work because I have several allergies and this helped.  I used 2 cups of bread crust crumbled (white rice)  Read review and doubled milk, used three banannas, no eggs or apples.  Doubled honey and brown sugar.  Left other spices the same.  May sub some pear sause for a bananna next time.  Cooked at 350 took out 5 mins early.  This was bannana bread pudding.  If more banannas were added you could add more bread crumbs up your milk a bit and it would be a bit taller.  I served with choice of cream or ice cream.  Wonderful

I thought this recipe was great!  I made it for my grandma and mom and they loved it.  They did not think it was too dry.

I really did not enjoy this.  The taste of the cloves was overpowering ans I could barely taste the banana.  I would not make this again.

Sorry to say, I agree with past reviewers on the dryness. Even as I was putting the bread crumbs in I thought it wasn't going to turn out right. Just on sight it's far too much. Perhaps 2 cups, or better yet, instead of bread crumbs using cubed, toast bread. It did make the house smell good, but I'm afraid most of this will find it's way to the trash.

DISASTER! I even tried it twice, as I thought I must have mixed something wrong the first time.
