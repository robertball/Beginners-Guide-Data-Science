I've made this at times that I've run out of ginger. And It's a great recipe if you want something cheap, easy, and quick! But I prefer using fresh ginger root. All you really have to do is boil the milk first (if the milk is too cold, when you add the ginger it'll turn into cheese) and then add the ginger. Add your sweetener and let it cook on medium to low heat for about 5 minutes. And if you want, you can always strain the ginger, but if you like to eat it, you can just leave it in! Lol. :D

Delicious! For cow's milk, this only needed 1.5 minutes over medium heat. For a kidney friendly drink, I used rice milk and that only needed about 1 minute over medium heat. This helps in reducing nausea when used with non-dairy milks. I used sugar in one cup and chose to use honey in the other. Both were equally delightful. Thank you Candice S for your recipe.

When I saw this recipe I knew exactly what it would taste like. Why have I not thought of this already? I used the processed refrigerated ginger that comes in a tube. In a few months, when winter arrives, I will be making this a lot! Thanks for something so simple.

It was very good a little to much ginger I think but it was still tasty

I used  fresh ground ginger root but I substituted the sugar with turbinado sugar. Also I didn’t use a strainer Because I wanted as much benefit from the root as possible. Very delicious I loved it. I had a friend from Lebanon suggest using honey instead of sugar so I will try that next time.

I heated the milk and ginger, but omitted the sugar. Since milk has natural sugar called lactose, it doesn’t need more. It is delicious, and it helps me fall asleep.
