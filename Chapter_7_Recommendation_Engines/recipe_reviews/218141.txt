I needed to make some comfort food for some friends and this did the trick.
Followed the recipe with the reduced fat soups and could not tell the difference. It was amazing. Served with a green salad and some warm Italian bread.  It was great!  This has become one of our favorites!

This was a great recipe. I have to admit that I did use full fat soups, but the end result was amazing.

Made this for dinner and it was outstanding.  Nice to have left over filling for toast, biscuits or the next pie.

Have to give this recipe 5 stars.  Finally, my kids ate vegetables and wanted seconds!!! Used 1 fat free and 1 regular can of soup, all I had on hand.  Also, did not have portabella mushrooms so used button mushrooms which was fine.  It was truly excellent.  Love the left over filling which has endless possibilities for the upcoming weekâ€™s menu.

The family and I agreed that this recipe was good, but not fantastic.  It was certainly easy to prepare and smelled wonderful while cooking.  The crust wouldn't brown with the aluminum foil over it, so I removed it and put it back in the oven for about 10 minutes to get it brown and flaky.  I followed the recipe exactly and it made quite a bit of extra filling.  I think I will serve it over biscuits for dinner tomorrow.

We really enjoyed this. Made a few minor changes based off what we had by using golden mushroom soup and cream of celery. Also used canned mushrooms vs fresh. Used red pepper even tho it says optional. Didn't thaw the frozen veggie blend (peas and corn). Used low fat soups and cream cheese. And lastly used two cups of rotisserie chicken we had a few nights prior. Absolutely love this recipe and will make again!!

I've made this recipe several times. I altered it slightly, leaving out the tomato and red pepper. It is awesome!!! This time around I am making one for dinner tonight and I will be freezing the other. Hopefully in a few weeks I will have a homemade frozen dinner.

Had a little spill out but my family loved it!!! Added chopped garlic cloves, chopped celery and left out the tomatoes. Added old bay and onion powder to the seasoning mix. Definitely going to be a family favorite!!

My family loves this pot pie. I double the recipe and bake it in a large clay baking dish . The only changes I make to this recipe are that I use  tomatoes with green chilies and add fresh sliced mushrooms and fresh broccoli .
