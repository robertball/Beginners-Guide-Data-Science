Yum! Actually used leftover rotisserie chicken and came out delicious.  Super simple.  Left off crushed croutons.

Hubby said this was really good and both kids ate the chicken with the tomatoes taken off.  I liked that it was quick and I had the ingredients.

I made this using tenderized chicken breast and my son and I both loved it. I did season my chicken with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning though. I also baked my chicken in the reserved tomato juice instead of cooking it on the stovetop. It took a little longer, but it gave the flavors time to penetrate the chicken.

My family and I really loved this recipe. We mixed in some cooked spaghetti at the end. We will definitely be making this again

This was very good! I guess it will depend on your breast size but this did have to cook much longer than directed (finished mine in the oven). I did season the chicken with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning before browning them which added a lot of flavor.

Yum! I had 2.2 lbs of chicken in my fridge so I doubled the recipe. I had to cook my chicken a bit longer due to breast size, so next time I intend to cut the breasts into tenders. I also added one cut up zucchini for color and more veggies. If you're worried about this tasting bland, consider the croutons you're adding. We used cheesy garlic croutons and it was delicious. I also added the croutons to each individual plate because I wanted to be sure my four year old would eat hers. She ate half a breast herself and will enjoy the rest with more veggies and croutons for lunch tomorrow!
