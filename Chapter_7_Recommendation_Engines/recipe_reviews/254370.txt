I have an oat sensitivity so I was excited to find these! Im trying to stay away from refined sugars (including honey) so I replaced the honey by taking a cup of chopped dates and a cup of water & simmering until it was a paste (used an emersion blender to help it along).  I also added a dash of cardamom and used raw pumpkin seeds in place of sunflower seeds.  These basically taste like a really healthy dessert and I keep them in my freezer!  So excited to find these and will continue to change up the recipe :)

I like the idea of an oat-free granola, seeing that I'm allergic to oats. This recipe won't let you down as far as taste goes. There is a bit too much oil and cinnamon for us, so next time I will certainly reduce those amounts. It makes a very large batch, keep that in mind. After two hours on the counter it had hardened into a loose granola. I ate that with a banana and some milk, like a cereal, and loved the taste. and crunch. After freezing it, I was able to cut it into bars, but they melt quickly. It is summer, so it is ok. A nice cool, healthy treat is not a problem. I don't know how well this will travel; but on top of cereal, ice cream, yogurt, etc., this is very good. Read the notes first for some good tips. I used dried cranberries instead of apricots. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious frozen treat! I wasn't sure about the taste at first but once they were completely frozen, I became addicted! These are great when you are craving something sweet but want a to stick with a clean and healthy snack.
The only change I will make for my next batch will be to reduce  the coconut oil by about 1/4 cup . 
Thanks for the great recipe princessgertie!
