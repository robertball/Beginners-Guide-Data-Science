Yum!!  I was attracted by the rave reviews by males (husbands, fiances) :)  My husband likes spice and it wasn't too sweet for him like other sweet potatoe dishes.  I took the suggestions to add a teaspoon of Cinnamon and a tablespoon of Brown Sugar.  I only used 1 teaspoon of Paprika rather than 1 1/2 Tablespoons (?) and also left out the poultry seasoning.  I used Olive Oil, adding only enough to cover the amount of potatoes I had so not quite 3T.  I also oiled the glass dish I cooked them in so altogether, there was plenty of oil to not burn to the dish yet not too much.  I look forward to making this again and using some of the other tips to create different flavors, like using fajita seasoning or steak seasoning instead of poultry seasoning.  This recipe has opened my mind to the options of flavors (not to mention healthier dishes)for Sweet Potatoes, other than the typical super sweet, marshmallows, maple syrup, etc.

This was FANTASTIC!!!! It was sooo delicious! I will definitely make this again. I used 2 tbsp. of brown sugar instead of the suggested 2 tsp. I did not have poultry powder, so I used McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning. I used fresh garlic instead of powdered. I used the suggestion of a previous reviewer -"Adrienne" and added some cinnamon. Thanks for the great delicious recipe!

This was a great recipe. I altered it slightly to fit the spices I had. Plus we don't like things that are too spicy. I omitted the cayenne pepper, the poultry seasoning, and the onion powder, and added 1/2 tsp of seasoning salt. I believe my sweet potatoes were on the smaller side. Instead of baking in the oven, I put the whole mixture in the crockpot for 3 hours and had a lovely side dish. Will be making this recipe again for Thanksgiving this year!

Awesome recipe! We followed the recipe exactly omitting the poultry seasoning (we have none) and am having them again tonight. If you take the time to chop the potatoes a little smaller...then every bite gets more crispy and tasteful. We mix everything in a large ziploc bag and dump them on our baking sheet. Bake them at 425 for 20 - 25 mins flipping halfway through. Easy and delicious! One of our favs!

First time making sweet potatoes.  Created my own spice mixture - 1 tbs. cumin, 1/2 tsp. chili powder, 1/4 tsp. curry powder, and salt.  Cut the sweet potatoes into thin slices, along with garlic cloves.  Would definitely make again!!

I had been looking for an alternative for sweet potatoes, because most of them really should be considered dessert recipes.  This one worked nicely.  I didn't have any sweet potatoes, so I used beets instead, and I didn't have the spices called for, so I used my own mix, and instead of baking it, I boiled it.   Just kidding!  What's up with people who review a recipe like that, having completely changed it?!  I made it exactly as written, although next time, I will be tempted to try some of the spice variations suggested.   After it was done, and after I tasted it, I mixed in some chopped walnuts, because my wife wanted "sweet potatoes with nuts".   It was good that way, although I'm sure pecans would be better.

Used 1 tbsp brown suger and 1 tsp cinnamon as suggested.   Didn't have any poultry seasoning.  Had almost a full bowl of cubed potatoes.  Used just over half of the spices that were all mixed together in a small bowl, seemed like a lot of spice on the potatoes without using the remaining spices. Will save for next time.  Everyone liked them.

This was a delicious recipe! It tasted just like the title suggests - sweet and spicy. The only changes I made were to accidentally double the black pepper, and to omit the poultry seasoning because I didn't have any. This is a recipe I would gladly make again and again!

This is a great side dish! I omitted the poultry seasoning and did not have onion powder, but I did have some fresh red and sweet onions. I cut a little of each chunky like the cuts of the potato, mixed in, and baked. I also sprinkled some Kosher salt before placing in the oven.  Came out great!

Delicious. To make sure the spices get distributed evenly, I like to mix all of them together first, and then mix it in with the sweet potatoes.

My roommate made these last night and we loved them!  No poultry seasoning, but a bit of cinnamon was added.  Great as a side for dinner, but works very well as a snack.  We just ate them out of the bowl with our fingers!

This was so good, and exactly what I was craving. I followed what the previous reviewers suggested about adding cinnamon, and I didn't have paprika or cayenne pepper but I love spicy things so I threw in fajita seasoning. I also didn't have poultry seasoning, but I had this mexican chicken/steak spicy seasoning, and it turned out SO GOOD! I also doubled the brown sugar. I will make this again and again

First off, since I had just medium sz sweet potatoes, I thought I could lessen some of the spice, specially the tablespoon n 1/2 of paprika (used 1/2 of this amount of sweet paprika).  Since we like spicy, I really should have used the whole amount and even more of some.  Let me say this has excellent flavors and cooks really quickly!  After tasting, thought even a cajun blend would taste pretty good with the rest.  This will be a regular for us here in sweet potato country of NC!  Thanks, Erin for the great post!

Loved this recipe!  I made just a few changes, mostly for health.  I subbed out half the olive oil for apple juice concentrate, which provided moisture and flavor for much fewer calories (I'm a big fan of olive oil but it's very fattening so half was great).  I also omitted poultry seasoning but equally subbed with cinnamon (helps metabolize those sugars) and I stuck with the original sugar level but did add 1/2 tsp of pure stevia extract for sweetness.  I also had to cut down the paprika some because I was using a Spanish hot smoked paprika and though I love hot, I thought with the cayenne, it may be a little too hot.  I kept the ratios the same for all the toppings except swapping the poultry for cinnamon and cutting the paprika in half.  Then I coated the tatos in the olive oil/apple juice concentrate and spread a layer and sprayed with a natural butter flavor topping and sprinkled the topping on that layer and added another layer and did the same until I had them all coated (I made for 16 servings so it was a few layers).  I also used a few Russet potatoes with all the sweet potatoes as I had three little ones that were going to go soft.  The end result was a slightly sweet, spicy and very healthy tato dish.  Fairly low calorie, quite respectable as a main dish and quite filling with a giant spinach salad.  I also diced the potatoes and left all skins on as they are necessary for the fiber and nutrients and I roasted for 15 minutes, stirred and roasted another 10 and they

My family loved these! I also omitted the poultry seasoning, but kept everything else the same. Next time I probably would increase the cayenne because DH and our 2 sons really love heat. Thanks for a great recipe Erin!

What a wonderful recipe!!My husband LOVES it and even asked to make them on Thanksgiving instead of the candied ones I make(I think I will change it up a bit:)  They were so delish and not too spicy at all. Very easy to make ahead and keep warm, which was what I did and they came out great! I used 2 small/medium potatoes and the seasoning was perfect. Will keep this around for a long time...

Pretty good! I'm experimenting with sweet potatoes to find what I like best and this is a keeper. I made into fries (the seasoning would be amazing on regular homeade fries, but I'm trying to go the more healthy route!). Definitely use a ziplock bag to mix and foil on the pan. Microwaved in casserole dish with teaspon water for 5 mins, then cut them - much easier! Thanks for the recipe!!

These were delicious!! I omitted the paprika, Onion & Garlic powder, but, I added some cinnamon. These were a big hit around the dinner table. The little ones even gobbled them up. :) Not too sweet, or too spicy.  YUM!!

I made this without the poultry seasoning and thought it was a delicious combination of sweet and spicy.  I made another batch of the spice mix without the poultry seasoning and brown sugar to use on the sweet potato fries that I get from Sam's Club.  It really livened them up!

These are terrific!  Guests who weren't big fans of sweet potatoes devoured them.  I added fresh, chopped Rosemary, and I wasn't very careful with measuring the spices, so I know I added more than called for.  The red pepper and sugar are key and really give the dish a great sweet kick.  I plan to make them for a dinner party.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

The hot spices were a little too overpowering and did not balance with the sweet. Otherwise, this would've been 5 stars for us. After tasting, felt it needed a sprinkle of salt and some melted butter to enhance the flavors. I will definitely tweak it to our taste buds. Thanks for posting the recipe.

We LOVED these! Usually when a recipe is described as "spicy" I don't expect much; I can handle quite a bit. So I was pleased that these had a good balance between sweet and spicy. There is definitely heat here! Will make again for sure!
UPDATE: The first time I made these I did not have the poultry seasoning. I tried them again with it included and thought it was way too strong. We def. prefer it without it!

2011- I made this mix and gave as gifts for xmas,  with the 2 potatoes and recipe... it was a big hit. 

I have made and passed this recipes onto so many people because it is fantastic... I make many batches when company is coming because 2 potatoes will not cover it.  I eat a single recipe by myself. Great job.

It would be helpful to list the approximate weight of "two large sweet potatoes" as size can vary a lot. I found the amount of powdered spice excessive for my "two large potatoes". In addition, the spice does not easily blend in with the oil and potatoes when prepared as directed. Combining the oil and spices in a bag or bowl BEFORE adding the potatoes would allow a more even distribution of spice. The paprika can definitely be reduced to a teaspoon or two as others have suggested--it does not add much flavor, only a lot of powder.  The spice mixture is primarily spicy (not sweet and spicy) and we prefer other roasted potato recipes and spice combinations to this one. I will not make this recipe again.

These were awesome!!  Great flavor combination with the sweet and spicey.  I may even try adding some cumin next time.  We always have sweet potatoes in the house so I am always looking for a different way to cook them.  My only complaint was that the potatoes never got a "roasted" type of crispiness to them.  I may take the broiler to them in the last few minutes of cook time the next time.

With all of the rave reviews, I expected more from this recipe. Based on a some of the prior feedback, I cut the paprika back to 1 tablespoon and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, but instead of spreading the potatoes on a baking sheet, I put them in a covered casserole dish to bake. I was concerned the brown sugar might burn before the potatoes were cooked otherwise. I was just surprised the seasonings did not come through more, especially the cayenne. I would probably do a simpler approach next time - garlic powder, brown sugar, cinnamon and definitely more cayenne/red pepper.

I used smoked paprika and it was amazing! Definitely use all the seasoning, even though it looks like a ton. A lot of the flavour is lost somehow with the baking process so you'll be glad to have it.

We hate marshmellow sweet potatoes, and were looking for something different from mom's "Pone". This is a GREAT way to prepare sweet potatoes. My Family LOVED it. Yumola.

I made these potatoes for family in town with high hopes they would be amazing...how disappointing.  Won't make them again, the spices smelled good all mixed together, but tasting it all put together wasn't good.

This is delicious. I've roasted these in the oven and also sauteed them on the stovetop, working with small amounts of chicken stock until they were done. The "sauce" that's created this way is savory and sweet and just delicious.   Works both ways, although roasting always brings out the flavor more.  Either way, a hit.  :)

WOW! So good! I increased the amt of olive oil, afraid they would be too dry. However this was unnecessary, and mine ended up too oily. I also doubled the amount of brown sugar and I'm glad I did, they were perfectly sweet!! So happy I found this recipe!

Yum! This is really good. I used honey instead of brown sugar just because I ran out of brown sugar. I left the skins on to retain all the nutrients. Also, they took a lot longer to cook than stated in the directions.

Man, this was good! My husband and I ate a whole pan for dinner one night lol. I didn't add the brown sugar because the sweet potatoes don't need added sugar; and I didn't use poultry seasoning because I don't buy it. To save a step, I put the diced sweet potatoes directly on the baking sheet, sprinkled them with oil and tossed them, then added the spice mixture and tossed again. No need to get an extra bowl dirty. These spicy sweet potatoes are so delicious, and so easy! Will be making this again and again! Thank you for the recipe!

I liked the idea but not the taste. I omitted the cayenne pepper so it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids and the end result was still too spicy. :( I think sweet and salty (rather than spicy) would be good. I will probably try around with my own spices next time but thanks for the idea! :)

We loved this! I didn't have paprika, so I used cumin instead (and only used half as much as was called for). It was very yummy! I also added a little more brown sugar. :) Can't wait to make it again with paprika!

I don't usually write reviews for recipes but this was so easy and so delicious!  I used a spice blend as I didn't have any paprika or poultry seasoning and I cut back on the chili powder and pepper.   I also added some sea salt and did not totally peel the potatoes as the skin is so healthy for you.  I wanted to eat all 4 servings!

I always double everything--especially the sugar. We make it at least six times a year. Sometimes I add whole cloves of garlic (skins still on) for people to squish out and spread on to their bread or crackers. Excellent.

LOVED THESE POTATOES! Delicious and perfect. Will definitely make again! If you like condiments (like I do) add a dollop of sour cream to accompany the hot potatoes fresh from the oven.

Very good!  Made this for my Thanksgiving table and liked it quite a bit.  I made as stated with the exception of poultry seasoning.  Many of the reviewers didn't seem to care for it and I didn't have time to test run this recipe before serving it to the large Thanksgiving group so I figured better safe than sorry.

AMAZING! I made these for my pregnant wife (as well as myself) and she loved them! I didn't have onion powder but i don't think they suffered for it. I was asked to make them again, even considering trying them on the grill....

Great flavor. I had to cook about 15 min longer than suggested but final product was delicious. I could see this blend also being used on broccoli, regular potatoes, even zucchini. 5 stars.

I've made these sweet potatoes twice now and they are delicious! My son, who does not think a vegetable should be sweet, LOVES these. Perfectly spicy. The potatoes get all carmelized on the edges! Yum!

Great recipe.  Next time I will just drizzle about half as much olive oil in my pan, toss the cubed sweet potatoes right in the pan, then sprinkle with already mixed together dry ingredients.  My husband loved these.

Excellent! Reducing the olive oil to 1 T is the only modification, although some of the other suggested spices (cumin, cinnamon, curry) may make in to future editions in my kitchen.

Served to rave reviews at Thanksgiving. The very small amount of leftovers were incorporated into slow cooker beef stew and added a great flavor.

These are WONDERFUL!  I find if I don't follow the recipe, though, they either get too sweet or much too spicy.  As written, it's the perfect balance.

Very good, but I prefered the Cajun Style Baked Sweet Potato recipe a little bit more. This also needed salt (I didn't use the poultry seasoning, maybe that's why?).

So, so good. It's hard to find a good sweet potato recipe that isn't sickly sweet or a little bit bland. This recipe was perfect, and had just the right amount of spice.

This recipe sounded really good to me, not sure about the rest of the family, but I was willing to give it a try.  OMG, my Husband and Son were fighting over who was getting the last ones!  It is very good and we all really liked it.  A nice 'something different' for sweet potatoes.  I'll be making this one again.

I cut down on the olive oil and increased the brown sugar to 2 tbsp. The spice mixture is so good! I'd love to try it as a rub on pork or chicken.

I made the spice mix without poultry seasoning and tossed it with some boiled sweet potato cubes instead of roasting them. I used a pretty big pinch of cayenne because I wanted them nice and spicy, and also used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. They were great.

Awesome recipe! I made it for my parents a while ago as the normal one and I just made a less spicy version for Christmas dinner with my grandparents. All I did was cut down the paprika to about half, only used a sprinkle of chili powder and left out the cayenne completely. 
They loved it!

These weren’t bad but they weren’t quite as sweet or spicy as I had hoped for. I upped the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. and used 3 tsp. of brown sugar. Even with the adjustments I still wish they had been sweeter. Also, I don’t think they need to cook quite as long. 10 minutes per side should prevent the sauce from burning onto the potatoes as well. I may try this again with some big adjustments.

These were not that great to me. I followed the recipe and the potatoes just weren't anhything special. I guess they need some sort of glaze or something. I dunno, just weren't for me.

I made this dish when we were expecting people from Spain to stay at our house.  They loves it and so did my husband and I!  The only change I made was not putting the Cayenne pepper in because I am very sensitive to spicy foods.

Was delicious! Just the right amount of spice; Myself, husband and kids love it spicy! Next time I may add just a lil more sweet by adding a bit more brown sugar. Thanks for the yummy recipe. I will be making this again.

I coated potatoes well with oil first then mixed all spices together before sprinkling on potatoes.  I too doubled batch. Cut potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes. Added an extra 10 minutes to get them to brown nicely.  Agree that a little salt would be good, but they are good without too.

For years I have been trying to duplicate a sweet potato side dish that came with scollops I ordered in a restaurant. This one sounded so close, I had to try it. The only thing different was the side in the restaurant was mashed, so I baked the taters for 30 minutes, mashed them then added the dry ingredients as listed, replacing the olive oil with butter and no poultry seasoning or chilli powder(I didn't have either). I added the cumin as per the other rated suggestions. I put it back in the oven for about 15 minutes...this plus grilled shrimp, scollops and mushrooms along with roasted brussels sprouts was a VERY tasty way to begin the summer grilling season. Thanks for posting this! I will make it again!

A little too spicey and too little sweet. I followed the recipe exactly and found the spice overpowered the sweetness. Otherwise it was a nice change up from my typical baked sweet potatoe.

Great recipe! It's a good base for lots of variations. I made it with sweet potatoes, Russet potatoes and even with carrots. The three mixed up is great. I put less oil or put more potatoes to coat them slightly. That gives them a crunchy texture once out of the oven. Love it and I make it all the time.

These were really good in spite of the fact that I over-seasoned them. Thought I had two sweet potatoes, but one turned out to be a little on the rotten side. But when assembling the ingredients, I forgot to halve them. Tho I did only use a small amount of olive oil. Didn't use poultry seasoning as I have none, but did take other reviewers' advice and use only 1 TBSP of the brown sugar and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon. Delish. Served along side Easy & Elegant Pork Tenderloin and Quinoa with Peas, both from this site. Great meal.

The flavors explode in your mouth. I followed the recipe for 5 medium potatoes. I also added 1tsp cinnamon and no cayenne. I will be doing these again soon. I have a couple servings for tomorrow and can't wait.

This is my favorite new recipe! Everyone in my family loves this treat. It is so simple to make and easy to adapt to what you have on hand. I no longer add any brown sugar because I think the potatoes add enough sweetness. I have never added poultry seasoning but I do add crushed fennel seeds.

Delicious. Followed reviews and used 3 large sweet potatoes, increased brown sugar to 1 tablespoon, reduced paprika to 1 teaspoon. My family LOVED it. Said it was like a savory, spicy dessert. :)

This recipe is phenomenal solo, but also makes a good addition to chili or other entrees in need of a kick. I accidentally overdid the chili powder when making these yesterday, and managed to hide it by breaking up some baked cornbread. Yum!

Super yummy. Use food processor slicer. Once sliced as rounds, turn them over and run thru food processor again - makes a perfect Julianne cut!

The flavor was great, but these do not travel well, they got a bit too soft.  It also seemed like a lot of oil...I'll try it with less next time.  Used less paprika, less brown sugar, no onion powder.  Will add onion and garlic next time, too.

This is a keeper! I had been looking for the perfect sweet potatoes recipe for Thanksgiving dinner. Over the past couple of years, I've found a few that were okay, but not great. This recipe is easy AND delicious. I skipped the poultry seasoning, because I didn't have any. Also, I didn't realize I was low on olive oil, so I used mostly canola oil. Others suggesting adding cinnamon, and I will try that next time.

I followed the directions exactly, and mine burned.  Not really sure what I did wrong, I put them on a dark colored cookie sheet, so maybe that made a difference.  Still, 5 stars for the taste, they tasted almost like awesome seasoned french fries.

I'm hooked! This is my favorite snack!! I eat this so much that I increase the recipe by 7 times so I always have some on hand to pull-out when I want a snack. I think kids would probably love this too but the chili might be a little spicy for them. Here's what I do: Using the food processor, slice the potatoes as thin as possible, toss in melted butter, and then toss in the spice mixture as provided in this recipe; spread potatoes out to a single layer on the baking sheet; bake for 10 minutes, flip, and then bake for 5-10 more minutes. The trick is to bake them until all the liquid is removed from the potatoes without burning them. When they are done, allow them to rest for about 5 minutes, place them on a plate, and sprinkle with a very little bit of brown sugar (but it's not really even needed). When cooked this way, the potatoes turn out more like a chewy potato chip .... they are so addicting! Even my boyfriend, who doesn't enjoy vegetables, can't stop eating them.

We made these to go with our honey glazed Easter ham. They were very nice change from just regular sweet potatoes. I followed the recipe exactly, but we cooked them on the outside grill along with the ham. Went very well with honey ham. Very easy and will make these again. Thanks Erin.

Well received by the family. Next time will add a bit less sugar (to make it more savory) and cut into fries. A great everyday side dish.

I followed the review by Patti L on this almost verbatim. I added 1 tbls brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, left out the poultry seasoning, only 2 tsp of paprika, olive oil to coat (and also in the baking dish). Very good. The right balance of sweet and spicy. It was nice to have a more savory sweet potato dish. A definite keeper!

This is the perfect recipe for sweet potatoes if you don't like them candied.  They were just spicy enough to give it a full flavor.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon instead of the poultry seasoning.

Im a sucker for sweet potatoes and made this as a side dish. Turned out prefectly.  We all liked the sweet flavor from the brown sugar mixed with the spicyness from the chili powder.  This was a very EASY side dish that looked nice on the plate.

I left the skin on, using 3 very large potatoes, and wrapped the pan in foil. I cooked them at 400 degrees for 45 min's turning them every fifteen minutes. I doctored the spice mixtures as follows: 5 tsps brown sugar, 1 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp chai spice mix, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp white pepper, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp cumin. I let them cook until they were starting to turn black and they were AMAZING! I will definitely make these again, they really spiced up left-over night!

I was really excited about this recipe but found it to be terribly disappointing.  I must admit I didn't have any poultry seasoning so I subbed a chicken grilling seasoning and I also used a garlic powder mix instead of plain garlic powder.  I also skipped the cayenne.  But otherwise, I followed all the amounts exactly!   I'm actually a big fan of sweet potatoes in many forms.  There was something about this spice blend that really didn't work for me though.  The texture was ok.  I like the idea of tossing cubes with oil and seasoning.  But, this combo was a big no win for me.  Sorry!

AMAZING!  Absolutely delicious.  My husband, myself, and 10 mo old really loved it; the 4 year old and 6 year old weren't as keen, but that just left more for the rest of us.  :-)

These were very good, though I would have given 4.5 stars If I could have because I thought that 3 T of olive oil was too much.  My two sweet potatoes were huge, and just didn't crisp up enough because of too much oil. BUT, they were delicious anyway! Next time, and there will be a next time...I will just drizzle 1 tablespoon of the oil over the cubes AFTER I have tossed them together with the seasonings and then give it all a shimmy-shake!  I used a steak seasoning as well as a spice grinder combo of garlic and onion INSTEAD of the poultry seasoning, black pepper and chili powder. Everything else called for went into the mix and I went quite a bit heavier with the brown sugar....maybe because I had a ton of sweet potato cubes!  Everyone enjoyed these, and they are a much healthier alternative to the mashed white potatoes I would have served with the pot roast dinner we had tonight.

I had a bunch of sweet potatoes that I wasn't sure what to do with. This recipe sounded different and great. I loved the combo of the sweet and spicy but not too spicy mixture of flavors. My kids even ate this and they have never eaten sweet potatoes! I will use this recipe again! Next time instead of cubing the potatoes, I will make them in to fries and pair them with turkey burgers.

I just finished making these and HAD to review them right now!  They smelled so good in the oven that I couldn't resist picking at a few when they came out, and they are AMAZING!  I used 2 Tbl of brown sugar, rounded up on the chili powder and cayenne (I like spicy food), and also added some cinnamon.  But the thing that really made these great--I sprinkled liberally with sea salt as soon as they came out of the oven.  The salt provides the perfect contrast to the sweet and spicy and rounds out the flavors amazingly.  I'm bringing these to a potluck at work tomorrow, and I sure hope that no one likes them so that I can bring all the leftovers home with me!!!

I made these last week with a couple of small changes: I left out the poultry seasoning because I didn't have any and also the brown sugar because I think the potatoes have enough sugar in them.  I added some kosher salt as well.  They were great!  I'll definitely make these again and again.  Thanks!

These were awesome!  I did a "taste test" using half a sweet potato and cut down the amounts of the other ingredients.  I used Pam spray (olive oil) rather than actual olive oil.  These are an awesome side for burgers that are much healthier than french fries and I loved the zippiness to them.  I'm trying to decide between making these or Sweet Potato Pineapple Casserole for my family on Thanksgiving.  Excellent blend of seasoning!!

Perfect!   I see a lot of people have omitted the poultry seasoning from this recipe, however I say keep it in. I doubled the sugar and spices (except for the cayenne - hubby doesn't like too much heat) to coat the potatoes even more. I'll definitely make this again, and again, and again, and...   Just a tip to mix the spices and potatoes - it comes out cleaner than using a mixing bowl (which means less dishes to wash!). Get a large Ziploc bag and put the cubed potatoes in there. Add in the spices and oil, then seal the bag. Shake, shake, shake! Dump everything into the pan and throw out the bag.   Thanks so much, Erin, for posting this! Can't wait to try it on tofu pieces (instead of chicken - we're vegetarian) and see what else this can be used with.

I love sweet potatoes and I love this recipe.  My two young kids love them, too.  Although, they might be a bit too spicy for some kids (mine are used to spicy). I have made a batch with less heat for company with kids and they were good, too, but I love the original recipe. Thanks

Love this! I added more cayenne and homemade poultry seasoning. If you don't have poultry seasoning use fresh or dried herbs. For instance; rosemary, sage, thyme or blends (Italian). Go for it!

I’m one of the few who doesn’t love sweet potatoes but when my trainer added it to my nutrition plan I had to find a way to prepare them... this is my answer!  I LOVE THIS RECIPE! It takes no time to make, I already had the spices, and my family loves it!

These were very tasty, though finding that fine line where the outsides are nice and crispy and the insides remain soft is the challenge.

This dish is delicious. I served it with Grilled T bone Steaks, and salad. It is a bit spicy, but, the sweetness of the potato balanced it all perfectly.

I've made this recipe about 5-6 times - usually the same ingredients, but different prep.  If you toss the potato cubes in olive oil; toss again in the spices (I do all of this in a large ziploc bag); spread on parchment paper lined cookie sheet and roast.  I find that this distributes the spice evenly and allows for a crispy finish - otherwise I tend to get big clumps of spices randomly on the potatoes, which is not as good. I also use a reduced amount of garlic salt instead of garlic powder and cut back on the cayenne a bit.  Good with pork tenderloin or roast turkey - Yum!

I know it's supposed to be "sweet and spicy" but I felt like sweet potatoes are naturally sweet so I didn't add any sugar. I also like it  spicy so I added an entire teaspoon but might add even more next time.  So did I tweak it? Yes.  but it was delicious!

Very good! I'm not a sweet potato fan but my son is and he loved them.  Added the Montreal steak seasoning, cinnamon, 4 tsp brown sugar, and real garlic plus all the other ingredients in the recipe, minus the poultry seasoning!  Would have liked them a little more crisp but they were burning instead of crisping up so they were a bit on the soft side but still a keeper!  Will make again.

Delicious.  I sprinkled fresh chopped rosemary after a final toss in the last minutes.

I made this for our family Thanksgiving meal and everyone loved it! I had been looking for a change in the way I normally roasted sweet potatoes, and I think I found a new favorite.

I pan fried the potatoes in a cast iron skillet instead of baking them, at medium for a minute or two, then covering and lowering the heat to medium low, stirring occasionally until done. Delicious overall.

This has been my go-to sweet potato recipe for years now, so I'm finally reviewing it! I've done it several times roasting(always a classic), but I also used the spice blend the other day on sweet potatoes which I pressure-cooked and then blended in the food processor with the spice mix and a dollop of sour cream. These are like my ultimate comfort food. I've made it exactly as written, until I attempted the pressure cooker route with the spices the other day, and I love it. My only critique, for my own tastes, is that I always forget it's not really "spicy" at all as written. The amount of cayenne doesn't do it for me. But that's a personal preference and I love it all the same.

This was delicious!  We made a few changes based on the reviews, but mostly stayed  true to the recipe. We changed the amounts of some of the ingredients, left out the cayenne pepper and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.

Absolutely delicious, and I don't usually like sweet potatoes. It was not incredibly spicy, and was somewhat sweet. My dad thought it was too spicy, but he's a wimp when it comes to his spicy tolerance. If you are like my dad, I suggest cutting the amounts of cheyanne pepper and peprika in half. A great way to use up sweet potatoes though.

So far, this is the only way I can stand to eat sweet potatoes. I made a couple minor changes. I cut the potatoes into fries rather than a dice. I reduced the pepper by half as I don't like black pepper or spicy foods. I don't buy poultry seasoning, so I used 1/2 t. rubbed sage and added 1/4 t. salt as this had none.

This was really good and my guests loved it.  The only changes I made was to reduce the amount of paprika by half and eliminate the poultry seasoning.  I just don't like poultry seasoning in anything except stuffing.  As one other reviewer suggested I increased the brown sugar to 1 tbsp.  Great recipe.

I followed the recipe as posted.  Seems to me that the paprika was way out of balance.  Is 1 1/2 tbsp. paprika correct?

At Thanksgiving, it's nice to put a twist on a few traditional items . At the same time, they need to be near enough to what's expected to be enjoyed. This recipe hit both areas.

i got great reviews for Thanksgiving. I parboiled chunked Sweet potatoes (peeled) did the brown sugar with the spices.  Instead of Cayenne i used sprinking of Cajun seasoning. Baked at recommended Temp but increased to 475 last 10 min to brown and make a little chewier outer layer. Thats it! very easy.

Made it exactly as written, so I am reviewing the actual recipe and not omitting or changing anything, as I think we are suppose to do when reviewing recipes...love the spicy to go with the sweet. We have these once a week we love them so much.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This recipe is amazing! The only things I did differently was to reduce the brown sugar,added some diced red onion ( wanted to use up a leftover piece) and added more cayenne pepper. Would have liked the end result to be a little more crispy, but I blame myself for this because I crowded my baking sheet. Very delicious! Will definitely make again.

These were soooo yummy!  I am only a fan of sweet potatoes made certain ways (hate mashed or pie or souffles), but these definitely made the cut!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the poultry seasoning (didn't have any), and I made mine in a 13x9 glass pan in which I stirred every 10 minutes or so for a total baking time of 45 minutes (I used 3 large sweet potatoes and slightly larger chunks).  Ohhhh yum yum yum.  We LOVED these and will definitely make again and again!  Thank you SO much!  Delish!

It wasn't for us. The flavors were strange together and the powder burned.

I thought this was fantastic.  Next time I may make them a little spicier because we love hot food.  But they were really fantastic as written.

I am not a sweet potato lover, but loved this dish.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same, put all ingredients except potatoes in plastic bag and mixed together, added potatoes and shook until well coated and emptied on to cookie sheet.  We cut our chunks  quite small and it did not take 40 min. to get them done.  Keep an eye on them--you do not want to overdo them.

This was incredible!  We have tried many sweet potato recipes, and love, love, love this one!  The texture was just right, with some soft and some crunchy spots.  This is a keeper!

I'm not terribly good in the kitchen or with recipes, but this was easy and amazing. My husband and teenage stepson loved it.  My 8 year old daughter wasn't a huge fan but she doesn't care for sweet potatoes. I mixed all spices and put in a bag to coat potatoes. Will definitely make often.  Served it with Goya adobo pork loin recipe from this site and green beans.

Delicious! Converted members of my family who didn't care for sweet potatoes. I left off the chili powder and poultry seasoning because I thought that it might be a bit too overpowering, otherwise followed the rest of the recipe. Try this you won't be disappointed!

I made this into fries. We liked the kick without it being too sweet. I added some cayenne to fit our preference, so they were pretty spicy.

Made these when I was asked to bring a side dish to a Thanksgiving dinner to make a change from basic mashed sweet potatoes and they were a big hit, with many people going back for seconds. I didn't have poultry seasoning so I replaced it with ground sage. Nice blend of flavours and only mildly spicy. Easy to make and would definitely make again.

We loved this!  It's the perfect blend of sweet and spicy!  Like many reviewers, I omitted the poultry seasoning simply because I don't have any.  Will definitely be making the potatoes this way again.

Our family has never been a fan of sweet potatoes. Someone gave us a bag of sweet potatoes as a 'gag gift' for Christmas.  I felt guilty just throwing them away, so I randomly looked and found this recipe ... it was a hit with everyone!!

This recipe is incredible! I've never had sweet potatoes like this before. I used three sweet potatoes and there was more than enough spice mixture. Next time I'll either halve it, or use four sweet potatoes. A really easy way to get the yam cubes coated is to put them in a gallon ziplock bag. Add the oil, seal the bag, and shake until they're coated. Then add the spice mixture and do the same thing. I can't wait to make these again!

This was a fabulous recipe to make for my husband while he recovered from oral surgery. He was so sick of sweet foods and craved something spicy. I mashed the potatoes for that purpose. Now this recipe is part of our regular weeknight meal options.

These potatoes were delish! I didn't have garlic powder or paprika at the time and I also used stevia instead of brown sugar but they were still delish! My family loved them.

Pretty good. I wasn't sure whether the amount of paprika was a typo or not (does anyone know?), so I only added about a teaspoon of it. I followed the rest of the recipe and also added a couple of Tablespoons of dry sherry along with chopped onions and garlic (instead of powder because I didn't have any). I added some dried thyme, but didn't have any poultry seasoning. I let the whole mixture sit a mixing bowl until I was ready to put it in the oven (I like to get everything ready at once if I can earlier on in the day so dinner-time isn't as hectic). Took it out while the oven was preheating, then baked at 425 for 20 mins, flipped potatoes, and baked for another 20 mins. Came out really good, just not as sweet or as spicy as I'd expected. Next time I will use a Tablespoon of brown sugar as other reviewers did, and add a little more cayenne and chili powder (I did use hot chili powder).

This is a "keeper" as my wife and I say when we find a good recipe. The flavors in this dish are great and very addictive. I used a one gallon Ziploc bag to toss the spices on the potatoes and it really worked well. I have already shared it with friends and family and will be making it again. Easy and great!

LOVED these sweet potatoes!!!  I actually just cut the sweet potatoes into round slices probably 3 or 4 millimeters wide.  In the mixture, the changes I included were:
   3 Tbls of brown sugar
   Instead of poultry seasoning, I used a little cajun and all purpose
   1 Tsp of cinnamon.
I baked at 425 degrees for closer to 35 minutes.  WONDERFUL!

This is great!! Something new to do with sweet potatoes..sweet and spicy - very easy to make. I tossed everything into a gallon size ziploc bag so that everything was evenly coated..I changed it to one Tablespoon of brown sugar - omitted the poultry seasoning and added one teaspoon of cinnamon..will make this again..perfect!

From the smell of these I was afraid it'd be too spicy but it was a great balance of spice to off-set the sweetness.  Everyone liked them, even the boys.

A delicious way to fix sweet potatoes! I used only 1 tsp. paprika and omitted the poultry seasoning because another dish I was serving had poultry seasoning in it and I didn't want two dishes with the same flavor.

These were easy and good with our turkey breast. I used a Tbsp of brown sugar and cut way back on the paprika. I wouldn't like them with the whole amount of paprika- ugh. We like spicy, so I used several good hearty shakes of cayenne. I  found them to be a bit too dry for our taste, so I squeezed a nice amount of honey over the whole bowl--making them sweet, spicy, sticky sweet potatoes. I'll probably try something like this again, but won't use this recipe.

I didn't have poultry seasoning - next time I will make sure I do. Even so, these were very tasty. I added a bit more garlic powder just because I love garlic and I salted them some at the end.

Made these this weekend and everyone loved them. I usually don't like sweet potatoes because they're just too sweet but the spices in this balanced it out nice. I would give it a 5 but the taste needed a bit more of a kick to it. I think adding 2 tsp salt and increasing the cayenne pepper to 1tbsp would do the trick.

Not a huge fan.  Spices were too spicy and overpowered the sweet potato.  No salt at all, which was a disappointment in the final product.  I like the mixture of sweet and salty, which this recipe didn't have any.  This recipe was like licking a spice pepper spoon.  They also turned my fries soggy.  I will not be making this again.

Like others, I adjusted the spice amounts. That much on 2 potatoes would have been too spicy hot for us.  The brown sugar I upped to 1T, the paprika became 1t, and the rest was at 1/4 teaspoons.

Added 1/2  tsp white pepper and used adobo instead of poultry seasoning.... was excellent... then I used the leftovers along with zuchinni and onions to make a great brunch fritatta garnished with cheddar cheese and peppedews.  I will add this to my staple recipes for sweet potatoes

I really like the gist of the recipe, but like most of the people that have made this before I also changed the ingredients. I only used 2 tablespoons of olive oil, only 1 teaspoon of paprika, I omitted the poultry seasoning and added 2 more tablespoons of brown sugar. It was wonderful, the sweet hits your mouth first and then the spicy sneaks up on you.

Absolutely delicious! I've made it just as directed as well as cut back on some of the spices - mostly out of laziness and not wanting to get them all out of the cupboard. The 2nd time I just used brown sugar, onion & garlic powders, cayenne and black pepper. I admit I liked the 2nd version best as the flavors didn't overpower the remainder of the meal however both ways were fantastic. This is going to be a staple in our house.

I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed these very much.  They did come out a bit dry though, so I think next time I will try covering them for the 1st 15 min and see if that helps.

This was OK. I really like sweet potato so this recipe was fine for me but for others, it may seem flavorless (which is odd because there are so many seasonings). I felt like the seasonings didn't give all that much flavor and the amount made the sweet potato feel almost powdery. Maybe if there were salt added, the flavor of the other seasonings would have been brought out more? The brown sugar was the best seasoning in this. If I were to make it again, I'd add more brown sugar, more poultry seasoning and way less paprika.

I was also looking for a sweet potato recipe that was not like a dessert, and this fit the bill. I pretty much made it by the recipe, with a few little substitutions - but basically followed the gist of it. I also added chunks of onion, which came out delightfully crispy and yummy. Everything was a bit charred, which is why I'm giving it only four stars. Could it be the sugar? Anyway, like other reviewers have suggested, I think you could adapt this recipe to any number of herb/spice combinations, depending on your taste.

Even better; has anybody tried "Red Yams" yet?
Better than sweet potato with a more intense flavor and color.
Excellent any way you cook them.
Love this recipe....It leaves you wide open to get creative with whatever you have and/or feel like.
I added Tumeric/Paprika/Coriander seed(crushed)/salt/cayenne.
Also mixed in cubed red onions as per a reviewer recommendation.
Next time I'm cubing up a turnip and mixing that in also.

Excellent - I cooked in foil packet on a grill - they came out perfectly cooked along side Christine's Turkey Tenderloins from this site.
1/2 recipe, with one large garnet yam, fed 3 adults as a side dish.  Add something green (we did steamed green beans) and you have a great look for an early spring BBQ.

Absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it many, many times in the oven as directed and it always gets rave reviews.  Well tonight we made the recipe on the grill! Turned out fabulous without having to heat up the kitchen. 2 large sweet potatoes made 5 individual packets.  Here's what I did: 1) Tear off 5 sheets of tinfoil (approx 10 inches long).  2) Spray each piece of tinfoil with cooking spray.  3) Place cubed potatoes on foil. 4) Sprinkle with spices (I use all the listed ingredients with the exception of substituting red pepper flakes for the cayenne pepper and adding some Old Bay. 5) Sprinkle with brown sugar (about 1/2 tbs per package).  6)Drizzle with olive oil.  7) Make a seam down the center of the foil, pinching together tightly and rolling over.  Roll the ends up and seal tightly.  8) Grill on low over direct heat for 45 minutes, turning them over every approx every 15 minutes.  The potatoes are probably done at this point, but we left them on the grill with no heat on them while we cooked the meat and veggies, in this case marinated pork chops and corn on the cob (still in the husk).  So the sweet potatoes spent another 15 minutes on the grill over just ambient heat.  I absolutely LOVE this.  I will still make this recipe in the oven during the winter, but will DEFINITELY use this method in the spring / summer when most of our weekend cooking is done on the gas grill :)

Used Orange Infused Olive Oil instead of plain olive oil to put it over the top!  Also, didn't measure spices, because I was in a hurry, just sprinkled (to lightly cover) with garlic powder, paprika, cinnamon, salt, black pepper, cayenne and at least 3 tablespoons brown sugar. Tossed to be sure evenly coated and baked as directed.  Yum, yum, yum!

I wanted to try it at 1st "as it is", just went light on the onion-garlic taste I'm not fond of and replaced with ras-el-hanout mix. It was very good, spicy enough but not too much. Everybody loved it. I'm giving a 4 stars though for they were not really crispy (after 20mn oven). Shall surely try again but with 2 changes to suit better my French taste : a little less oil (2 spoons enough)and far less sugar - if ever some...

Tried this at Thanksgiving and had to have it again for Christmas dinner. So much better than all the gooey, sweet recipes. This recipe is a keeper!

Enjoyed this recipe and will make again.  I was looking for something different. Followed some reviewer suggestions.  Used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 cinnamon and fresh garlic.  Did not have paprika or poultry seasoning just used season salt.  Loved it!!

Tried this recipe almost to a T (didn't have onion powder) and it didn't turn out. Think It needs a bit more oil and time....and spices.

We are big sweet potato fans and I have made these sweet potatoes several times. WeLOVE them cooked this way.  The ONLY thing I change is reduce the paprika to 1 tablespoon.  Thank you Erin!

The only sweet potato recipe that my whole family liked.  And they really liked them!  Yae!  I added the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon that others suggested and did the 1-1/2 TEASPOONS of paprika, instead of Tablespoons.  I cooked it all in an oiled 9x13 Pyrex.

mmmmhmmm. delish. i had one ginormous sweet potato, halved the paprika and used more brown sugar. i also sprinkled some salt and cinnamon  right before i put them in the oven.  i baked them for the full 30 min w the flip, plus some to get a crunch; but i think when i eye balled the olive oil i used too much so they didn't crunch well. i really liked how they came out though. the perfect amount of kick for me and i am not a huge spice fan. my hubby didn't eat them because he thought they were too spicey ( he is not a spice fan at all though).  i was planning to use this dish as a side but it ended up a delicious snack. i will definitely make this again.

These are delicious.  I always omit the poultry seasoning since I don't typically have it on hand and it definitely isn't needed with all the other flavors.  For crispier potatoes increase the cooking time by a few minutes on each side.

I omitted the poultry seasoning and onion powder completely. For those who don't like spicy,  omit the cayenne pepper & chili power; it's still a great recipe!!

I did this in microwave since I needed it soft for
My husband's dental surgery. 
I also added a very small amt. of cranberry juice, some butter and cinnamon.
It was great this way and I will use the original method once he can eat regular food again.

This is not even out of the oven and I know its good from tasting it!
Although I should be honest, I used the recipe as an "idea" didn't measure anything and used what I had, which was pretty much the same flavors the recipe called for.  I'm still giving it a five because I didn't go completely opposite of the recipe or anything.  Thanks for a good idea! This super large sweet potato has been on the table for a month!

Delightful change to the more traditional ways of serving sweet potatoes.  The natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes contrasts nicely with the tang of paprika.

The only minor change I made was to fry them like breakfast home-fries after they were done baking.  But only long enough to give them a bit of that home-fry crunch.  

The entire family loved the dish.  Easy recipe to add to ones portfolio of dinner time options.

I normally don't like sweet potatoes.  I especially dislike sweet potato casserole.  So when my brother requested sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner this year, I was so glad that I came across this recipe.  It was fantastic.  The balance of spices was perfect so that it wasn't too spicy.  Great recipe, this is definitely a keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I didn't have garlic powder but just added some vegetable seasoning.  These were great and easy to make!  I used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar rather than 2 teaspoons.

This recipe is great!  I reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons to cut down on fat and did not have poultry seasoning.  Even with the omission it was great.

This was great! I made this for the family last night and doubled the recipe. There were no leftovers! However, we didn't have olive oil, paprika, or onion powder. I used vegetable oil instead and omitted the paprika and onion powder. Still turned out great! Will definitely make this again! I am interested in putting it on chicken or on ham!

I LOVE these! I read the other reviews and used some of their ideas as well. Especially the cinnamon. I don't have poultry seasoning or cayenne pepper, but just kind of made it up as i went along. Easy and delicious!

A nice change from the candied and backed sweet potatoes everyone makes.  My family who say they don't like sweet potatoes will eat these.

So tasty, I love that sweet and spicy flavor combo. Normally I just bake sweet potatoes so this was a welcome change. didn't have poultry seasoning so I left that out but kept the other ingredients the same.  This is a nice side dish for a dinner party.  Thanks for sharing!

It was Thanksgiving when I tried this recipe and I had no oven room so I partially boiled the potatoes and then put spices on it and threw it in the crockpot on high for a little over an hour they turned out GREAT!My husband loves sweet potatoes, and I was a little nervous about trying this recipe instead of the traditional marshmellow topping, but he said he loved this recipe even better!

We had it last night with "Marinated Flank Steak w/ Horseradish Sauce" from this site and salad.  Very good!  Guests asked for recipe.  I will make this regularly. Good to use up extra sweet potatoes that I didn't use at Thanksgiving -- plus they're pretty cheap this time of year.  Oh, I used yams - sweet potatoes are icky in the NW, no pretty color and not as much flavor as our yams.

Just a suggestion - if you completely change the recipe then it's not THIS recipe anymore. Post it and don't rate the original one well - very misleading....

Simple and excellent recipe! I hand measured the spices and it still tasted wonderful.  My husband who loathes sweet potatoes ate it all up.  Definitely no leftovers.

I think I'd rather have these sweet OR spicy.  I like the blend of spices but I'll probably omit the brown sugar next time.  Overall, great recipe and a nice change from the sweet recipes associated with sweet potatoes.

Did not care for the poultry seasoning. I will try  again without it, because I think the other flavors were good. I liked the spicy sweet aspect.

It's funny how everyone rates this recipe, then changes the whole thing. If you follow it exactly, don't skip the paprika or the poultry seasoning, you have 5 star perfection! I've made this several times making extra to have on hand because it's perfect on roasted chicken, or beer but chicken as well!

Expected a lot more after reading the reviews.  Tasted like the flavors did not blend and was bland.  I tried to mash them then put some butter on them but that didn't help.  Threw them out.

I thought these were OK. Maybe I was looking for a different texture. Surprisingly, hubby didn't like them, so I probably won't make them again.

I made this as directed but with fresh garlic and omitted the onion and it was still great! It has some bite and it's not too sweet- but it definately seemed like a nice balance of sweet(from the sweet potato) and spicy.  Better yet is how healthy this is and I thought it reheated quite well as leftovers.  I'll definately be making this again- thanks for posting it!

Cut them a little longer to have a more "fry" appearance.  Delicious, but I'd like them to be a little less sweet and a little more savory (maybe more chili powder and less sugar next time?).  Added ground cloves which I liked.  Maybe a little less olive oil - would have liked them a little crispier.  Overall delicious and had the crowd coming back for seconds.

This is a great way to cook sweet potatoes, especially since my family is not a fan of the traditional marshmallow type you usually find. I used 3 potatoes and still thought 3 TBSP of oil was a little much. Also, I would decrease the sugar by 1/2 since the potatoes are already so sweet. As others have posted, this is a very flexible recipe and very forgiving if you don't have all of the listed ingredients. I used 1/4 of a finely chopped onion instead of onion powder because I didn't have any and garlic salt instead of garlic powder. If you like things spicy, make sure your pinch of cayenne pepper is a healthy one!

So good! Especially with smoked paprika and/or chipotle powder in place of the cayenne.

This was not my favorite recipe.  Admittedly we aren't huge sweet potato fans in our family, but the spices didn't hardly add any flavor at all.  I was expecting a powerful punch of spice, and it wasn't.  It was an easy and quick way to cook sweet potatoes though.  Just might want to find a different or more flavorful way of spicing.

This was positively delicious and the texture was great--nice and soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I only hoped that I'd made more because they went down so easily!

Way too spicy for us, and I left out the cayenne, reduced the chili powder and increased the brown sugar.  I love sweet potatoes, but the sweet potato flavor didn't come through at all.

I admit that I am already partial to sweet potatoes, so that might be part of the 5 star rating.  ;)  The only alteration I made to this recipe was to omit the paprika because I didn't have any (oops).  Next time I will make sure to make my cubes a bit smaller so that I get a bit more of the crunch I like with oven potatoes.  I also might omit the brown sugar too since I don't think they really need it all that much and I am trying to watch what I eat.  I like the  addition of poultry seasoning, it gives the taters a little extra "something".  Thanks for sharing this extremely easy & pretty healthy recipe!

Just what I was looking for! Something different to do with sweet potatoes and this was perfect! I added a little extra brown sugar and didn't have poultry seasoning, but they were easy and delicious!

SO GOOD !!!  Great flavor, cooked them in a skillet within minutes while chicken was cooking in separate pan.  Paired with Frank's Red Hot buffalo chicken over white rice.

Delicious.  I think you can go with a bit less oil.. or just 3T on maybe 3 sweet potatoes.  I upped the sugar a bit (unintentionally) and used sweet paprika.  Doubled the garlic & onion powder and used Allepo chili powder & Chipotle powder instead of chili powder & cayenne (about 1t each).

Very good.  I'm not always very accurate on the measurements, but the seasoning was about perfect.  I think I may have used too much olive oil, and so the tators weren't as crisp as I would have liked.  I made a "sauce" for dunking:  ranch dressing, yogurt, sour cream, cilantro.  I would give it a 4-1/2 s5tarts, but given there is no 1/2 starts, I'm giving it 5 stars.  And I'll use less oil next time.  Very tasty.  :)

Delicious!  Omitted brown sugar and poultry seasoning.  Substituted fresh chopped garlic cloves for garlic powder and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  Will definitely make again!

This was a great way to serve sweet potatoes (although the little folk found it overly spicy). I used half the oil and paprika, seasoned salt instead of poultry seasoning and added 1/2 t. cinnamon. Excellent with meat dishes.

I really wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was! The poultry seasoning really made it taste more complete and we loved the cayenne! I sliced my potatoes into thin rounds (easier to control the coating) and it only took 15 minutes total to bake. Don't peel them, the oil and sugar make  the outside nice and crunchy. They're much much better right out of the oven than if you let them sit. Thanks for the recipe!!

We eat sweet potato fries alot but my husband liked these much better.  They cooked more evenly and faster for that matter.  My daughter prefers the taste of the fries that I had made with brown sugar, nutmeg, etc.  but these were a hit nonetheless.

Loved them! The blend of spices is perfect. The only change I made was leaving skins on the potatoes. It cuts way down on the prep time that way and it doesn't take away from the taste at all. This is going to be a regular side dish in our house.

This was really good! Next time I would halve the paprika as that was a little overpowering, and I might try adding some curry powder. I doubled the sauce and it really helped crisp up the potatoes. Definitely will make again, thanks!

I went by a recommendation from one of the reviewers to increase the amount of brown sugar... DONT DO IT! The extra sweetness just wasn't right. Everything else was good... keep the brown sugar as written the recipe

Would have liked a bit more spice, so I'll have to experiment a bit! Even so, this was a great recipe, and I agree with another reviewer that it's a nice alternative to the sweet syrup/brown sugar topping. Thanks!

I loved them... I used a roasting pan so the sides were a little bit burned but it added a nice crunch to them.. I'll try them next time on glass... I used 3 ts brown sugar but next time I'll use 2 like the recipe said... and I didn't have chili powder or poultry seasoning so I had to omit them.. they still tasted great

I did not care for these.  I made them for thanksgiving according to the recipe and they were quite bland.  The spices didn't seem to stick well to the potatos.  No one else really cared for them either.

i baked this in a covered casserole dish. i followed the recipe except did not have chili powder, so used 2 pinches of cayenne instead of 1. once the sweet potatoes were cooked, i drizzled maple syrup over the top and topped with mini marshmallows. Then baked for 5 more minutes to melt marshmallows. YUM! a keeper.

Spicy and sweet was a great combination!  I also added the cinnamon as many of the other reviewers have and it added just that extra little bit of something.  Wow!  I'll make these again and again and again.

we loved this recipe.  i used white sweet potatoes.  i didn't have any poultry seasoning so i used 1/4 tsp ground sage and 1/2 tsp thyme leaves which i ground up.  i used 2 tbs of dark brown sugar and only used 1/2 tsp of sweet paprika because that's what i had on hand.

I love sweet potatoes, but I never thought to spice them up. I left out the garlic as I had a lot of garlic in my main dish, but they were still perfect. I believe the TBS for paprika is correct as it gave the dish a beautiful warm orange glow.

This was great. I used the combination of spices i had in my house and just threw stuff on the potatoes until it seemed like enough. I thought they were too sweet and not spicy enough. But i love the concept and it is a great base to play with this sweet and spicy combo.

Wow, after all the great reviews I thought I would love this. But the taste of this blend of spices was strange to my whole family.  Ended up throwing half of it out.  Will not make again.

Very good recipe.  My only suggestion is to add more brown sugar or pour a little pure maple syrup to potatoes once cooked.  It just needs to be a little sweeter.

I had my husband make this for dinner since I am stuck working overtime. It was easy enough for him to follow it and the results were delicious ! We will add more of the spices since we both love very savory food.

These were actually really good, although too hot for my son. I dipped them in ketchup and could've eaten the whole recipe by myself! Yum!

I left the chili and cayenne off cause these are for my daughter.  She loved them!  If I made them for adults I would add the spice and I'm sure they would be fantastic!

Oh Wow! Can I say this will be my new favorite way to eat sweet potatoes. My kids who do not care for sweet potatoes with the ususal marshmallows and other wet stuff as my daughter says, really enjoyed this recipe. We didnt have poultry seasoning and it still came out with great flavor, in fact I didnt make enough, they asked for more. Great recipe!!

I was looking for a way to use up some leftover sweet potatoes, and this recipe was a delicious way to do it!  I didn't have any onion powder, so I left that out, but other than that, I made them exactly as directed.  I will definitely be making these again!  Thank you!

Very tasty! I've used this recipe twice now: one time with sweet potatoes and one time with yellow-skinned potatoes (skins on). The latter instance I substituted smoked paprika, which was just awesome. Thanks!

So yummy!  Loved the substitution of Montreal Seasoning for poultry season, increasing brown sugar to 2 Tbsp, and adding cinnamon.  So good, will definitely make again.

One of the Thanksgiving hits!! I doubled the recipie so I think the "spread" on the cookie sheet was a little thick.. I expected them to be a little more crispy, but I still liked them and got quite a few compliments. My whipped sweet potatoes were still the favorite, but I'll make these again. Thanks for the unique idea!!!

This recipie is very nice. I tend to like a smokey pepper taste, so I used a smoke jalepeno and omitted the cayenne pepper and chili powder--this is also great mashed.

Delicious! Surprisingly soft, a sweet and spicy snack. Good on a cold day, they'll warm you up!
