This classic French recipe needs an extra cup of flour to work. I took the photo pictured and had to add an extra cup of flour to make it workable. I checked several similar recipes and all used 2 cups of flour. Also, patting the dough in the pie plate works much better than trying to roll it out.

This is an excellent recipe but you must be careful.  If you refrigerate it too long or if you are even a little off on the amounts of the ingredients you can have problems such as it being stiff and unworkable.  However, it is very authentic and if you are willing to practice well worth following.

This dough is just fine, but do not over chill. Use fresh eggs. Not Pate Sablee ( sandy pastry- much more crumbly) Not really pate sucree either, but close enough

The recipe is okay but there is a huge difference between pate sucree and pate sablee. With sucree the butter is cut in before the other ingredients are added and with sablee the butter is creamed before adding it to dry ingredients. So this dough really isn't either. The dough is okay, just named wrong.
