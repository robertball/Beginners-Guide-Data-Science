This is one of my favorite drinks! My friend and I like the original Kahlua with Absolute Vanilla vodka and cream (or milk). Yum!

This reminds me of iced coffee with a kick, and that's a good thing! Great for an after dinner or dessert drink. :)

Love this.  I use skim milk...and sometimes, for an extra kick, I'll use Kahlua especial.  It's 70 proof...so be careful!

Love this!  I just purchased the Kahlua coffee cream flavor.  It is wonderful!!  The only bad thing is that it is only available through the holidays.

i like this much better than the traditional white russian that used more vodka than kahlua.  Since it's Christmastime, I used eggnog instead of cream for that "holiday" vibe!

to REALLY make this better instead of an oz of 1/2 and 1/2 use half of that and add an oz of yoo-hoo and shake the #*!! out of it *note that yoo-hoo is cholesterol free and fat-free
