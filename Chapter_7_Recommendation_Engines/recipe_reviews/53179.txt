I really like this and I really didn't have to watch it too much. I have two litle ones and they require a lot of attention so it was nice to be able to leave this one on the stove for a few and be able to walk away from it. I really liked the blend of spices and ingredients.

Delicious! My husband loved this dish - the sauce was tasty. I did find that the consomme dried up before the time was up for the simmering...so you may want to watch it closely. Overall very good.

It would not have been a terrible thing if this dish had stayed dormant. The sauce was overbearing and seemed to be missing something. It was worth a shot but I won't be making this again.

I dislike the idea of writing a "negative" review especially since everyone's tastes vary. Although I liked the breaded chicken and the tenderness of the finished product I have to say that the sauce appealed to neither me nor my husband.

Intense flavor! Excellent even before adding the sour cream/mustard "sauce". Quite rich though. Next time I won't add quite so much sour cream. And there will be a next time.........

The sauce from this recipe is quite similar to that of the great Chicken Dijon recipe at Julio's a great chain of Mexican restaurants in Omaha Nebraska. I served this with Lemon Green Beans with Walnuts another allrecipes recipe which was an awesome side dish. Next time I will whip up some rice to go with the beans and chicken which is how it's served at Julio's. If you trend towards being a picky eater--fussy about something that taste a little exotic or different maybe this isn't for you; but for everyone else you can't go wrong! This will be in my regular rotation.

I thought that this chicken was good but I made some changes to the recipe. I added a tsp of Paula Deen's seasoning salt recipe to the flour (it is 1 cup salt 1/4 cup garlic powder 1/4 cup black pepper - keep it in a ziplock bag I use it all the time) which imparted more flavor to the chicken itself. I added a can of sliced mushrooms which complemented the chicken. I also cut back the dijon mustard to two spoonfuls which was plenty for my tastes. I found this to be pleasantly salty which comes from someone that hates anything to be too salty. If you're afraid everything will taste too salty I would limit the amount of parmesan cheese but do use some because it added an added something compared to other dijon cream sauce dishes I have prepared. The whole thing was very easy and used a lot of ingredients I usually have on hand.

If you are tired of fixing chicken the same old ways then try this dish! Even my two little boys loved it. It's definitely a keeper.

This chicken should be left dormant. I did not like the sauce at all. It took over and hour to prepare and cook. I was disappointed and I don't think I'll be trying this dish again.

I think this recipe is easy and delicious. I have made it twice with great results both times. Next time I will omit or reduce the butter and just brown it in my non-stick skillet. I am forwarding this recipe on to my friends.

Not bad the dijon flavor is a nice change for chicken. I think it is a must to be served over rice (or noodles) for it to be enjoyed the most. The chicken comes out prety juicy and tender...

I seasoned the flour with a few spices (onion powder garlic powder seasoning salt fresh ground pepper) before coating the chicken with it. I also sauteed half of a sliced onion in with the garlic and when I made the gravy I added a good amount of fresh ground pepper. I served this with steamed brown rice and roasted vegetables. Serving it with the rice gave us an outlet to soak up all that tasty gravy. The gravy reminded me of the sauce for stroganoff. NO leftovers. Husband says next time I make this to double it so he has extra for his lunch the next day.

This was pretty good-the chicken was very tender after simmering for so long.
