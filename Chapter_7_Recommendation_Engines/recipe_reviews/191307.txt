My husband LOVED this sauce! I did tweak it a bit because it tasted bland.  I tripled the amount of lemon juice and doubled the salt.  I also added a few dashes of tobasco.  Do NOT leave out the fresh ginger. It makes the recipe! I served blackened salmon on wilted spinach and poured this on top.  It was so good! It tastes like Greek Tsatsiki.  I will definitely make it again.

Great sauce! I made this exactly as written and used it on lemon-steamed salmon. The flavors are BOLD, so this recipe is not for the meek. Really different and delicious. Thanks!
