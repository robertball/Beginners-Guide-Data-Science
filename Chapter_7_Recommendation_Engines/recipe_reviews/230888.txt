This worked well, I should have started dinner sooner but that was my fault for not looking at the cooking time when I read the recipe earlier in the day. The rice came out perfectly done the meat tender and juicy and the flavor was banging. Good enough that I was forgiven for missing the 6 Oclock dinner bell :)

Incredibly simple and succulent.  beef stock 500ml (2cups) and a generous dash of dry white wine (approx 1/4 cup) worked well as an alternative to the consommé

Easy and tasty.  I used three roma tomatoes and Penzey's Bavarian Seasoning instead of the marjoram and thyme the recipe calls for.

It worked well, but add one step for more flavour: after searing the chops, drain off extra fat and deglaze the pan with some or all of the broth. You will also speed up the cooking if you heat all the broth, so adjust cooking time as well.

This was easy to make and tasted great. Add a little hot sauce or red chili peppers to spice this dish up a bit if you like that kind of thing.

Tasty and attractive, but make the dish look nicer by layering the veggies on top of the pork rather than vice versa.  I put salt and pepper on the pork chops before searing to lock in more flavor, but otherwise, a lovely dish.

I think it was a good base recipe. I used a 9x13 glass baking dish and I didn't layer it as instructed in the recipe. I used about half of a large bell pepper, added approximately half a cup of fresh broccoli florets, and approximately half a cup of mushrooms. I also substituted the marjarim and thyme with approximately a tablespoon of Italian seasoning. I was a little concerned that the rice wouldn't cook thoroughly with the additional veggies. However, as mentioned previously, the pork chops were too dry and the rice was mushy. The pork chops were also bland. I didn't even leave it in the oven for the full hour and 45 minutes; cooked apx 1 hr and 15 minutes. I will use the recipe again but next time I plan to use thicker, bone in, pork chops (after marinating them) and cook for maybe 45 minutes to an hour.

Very good and easy. Could probably use chicken for this recipe too.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of Beef Broth. Made for 2 so only used two pork chops.

I made this for New Year's Eve dinner. I followed the recipe mostly, only substituted Campbell's beef broth with red wine for the consommé. Baking it at a lower temperature for a longer time made the rice turn out nice and moist, and the flavours were great. The onion came out almost cartelized, but without the greasiness from using oil. I will definitely make it again, a great casserole for company, as you can prep it and leave it to bake beforehand. I might add a cup of salsa next time for an added kick.

Not enough flavor as written.  Would try the base recipe again, with extra onion and some additional seasoning.

I used bone in pork chops that were about 1 1/2" thick. I also used a fancier rice blend which gave it a nice flavor.  The timing was a bit too long and the chops a bit overcooked,  but overall it was amazing!

The rice was fine, but the pork chop was way too dry.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was edible but not great.  The rice was mushy and the whole dish was bland and lacked seasoning.  I will not make it again.

My family enjoyed it. I mostly followed the recipe but I used thin bone-in chops (our preference). Seasoned a little differently for a sodium restricted diet. I couldn't find unsalted beef bouillon so I used unsalted beef stock. I do think the bouillon would make a better flavor. I also cut the veggies smaller for a little picky eater. Will definitely make again.

Mixed feelings about this one. The pork chops themselves came out very dry and not as flavorable as I'd hoped, but the rice was full of flavor. I've taken to making the rice, tomatoes, onions, etc as a side, covering and baking until the rice is cooked. I wouldn't recommend the pork chops, but this is great for a rice side dish.
