I loved the recipe but I did modify it quite a bit.  I marinated the chicken with balsamic vinegar, fresh ginger, cilantro, and a little olive oil.  this made the chicken really juicy and tender after grilling.  I also added some tomato to the salsa.

This is one of the best recipes I've tried so far and one that I can't wait to make again. I marinated the chicken overnight in my own blend of OJ, lemon and lime juice with red onion, ginger, cilantro, garlic and jalapeno to compliment the mango salsa. I grilled the breasts on my barbeqque and they came out tender and very juicy and the mango salsa played off the flavors very well. Overall, a simple and easy way to serve otherwise a routine chicken dinner.

This was an excellent recipe!  We used bone in chicken breasts and added red pepper flakes, a little brown sugar and EXTRA GINGER to the recipe.  At least, I think it was extra ginger.  The amount isn't really clear in the directions.  We used the remaining salsa (it makes a lot!) on shrimp a couple days later.  It was truly wonderful!  Thanks, Rimi!

Good recipe.  Go easy on the ginger root, though. I added papaya just for chunks - mango was stringy.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was adding the juice of half a lime to the salsa.  I used the other half of the lime to juice the chicken breast after it was done grilling.  I found that this helped balance the strong taste of the ginger root.  Thanks for the recipe; we will definitely make this again!

This recipe was o.k.  It needed something more...I added orange juice.  It needs a zest of something.  I kept tasting the vinegar.

Unusual yet tasty. We really like ginger, so I used a lot of it, which gave it a lot of zing. Complemented the barbecued chicken very well.

This mango chicken was great!  I ommitted the white whine and added the juice of 1 lime instead and it was amazing. I served it with a lime-cilantro rice.  This meal is impressive with its bold taste and it looks beautiful on the plate.   ALSO-because it was snowing outside. instead of using a grill, I cooked the chicken in a frying pan with a lid on it and it was still fantastic!

This has terrific potential with just a bit of tweaking. the chicken seems under seasoned for our taste so I marinated bone in chicken breast  in orange muscat wine vinegar and a little oil and ginger. I also used the orange muscat vinegar for the salsa. Very tasty and healthy dinner.  Thanks so much for sharing this tasty recipe.

This was insanely awesome.  Someone here had mentioned marinating the chicken in some balsamic vinegar, olive oil, ginger, and cilantro.  I did the same and I've never, EVER had chicken as juicy and delicious as this.  Thanks for the recipe :)  I'll be making this again.....and again and again :D

I tweaked this a little based on what I had in the pantry - I used ground ginger instead, and added it to the chicken before baking. I also had to use frozen mango pieces and white vinegar instead of cider (I don't know if I'd even be able to tell a difference anyway). I added chopped white onion, too. I thought this recipe was really fresh and tasty, but my husband didn't like it much... he only ate the chicken, and he loves mango!. He thinks it would be better if the fruit was chilled instead, and it did seem to me that the the flavors developed more after it had cooled on my plate. When I try this again, I will probably dice the mango into little pieces and chill it before serving. I would like to try this with fish next!

Added balsamic vinegar and olive oil as a marinade; instead of white wine (didn't have any).

This was really good! I had a ripe mango from the tree and wanted to have it with chicken. This was a very tasty compliment to grilled chicken. Will make again!
