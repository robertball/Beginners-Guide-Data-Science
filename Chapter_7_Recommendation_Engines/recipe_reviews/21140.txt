This was the first recipe I've tried from this site that was not a 5 star recipe.  It looked like a no fail recipe and absolutely was!  My husband said several times, "this is a winner".  I doubled the stuffing and split and stuffed the pork chops with about half the stuffing before browning them.  My husband said next time I should triple the stuffing and double the gravy.  What a quick and wonderful meal that is definitely company worthy!

This was delicious with a couple of minor changes.  I added a little extra onion and celery to the stuffing and also some grated apple and chopped mushroom. Day old French bread worked well for the stuffing, but I may use a more flavorful bread next time.  As suggested by another reviewer, I cooked on 325 degrees for 2 hours and the chops were tender as could be.  The cream of mushroom soup and milk (I used milk instead of water) makes a flavorful pork gravy that is wonderful!  We put the gravy over mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Righteous!

This is a delicious recipe! I also made a few minor adjustments. I doubled up on the stuffing, adding more onions and celery as well. I sauteed the onions and celery in a little butter to soften. I had bought thick chops, so I cut a cavity in them and stuffed the stuffing inside, then I browned the chops in a sautee pan. I spread the extra stuffing on the bottom of the pan and put the chops on top of it, put the soup over them, covered it with foil and baked at 325 for about 2 hours. It was awesome!

I modified the recipe slightly by using a pork-flavored box stuffing as suggested by another reviewer.  I also added a little more more chicken broth to the stuffing mixture for more moisture and used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom.  The last modification I made was to cut pockets into the chops and actually stuff them!  Leftover stuffing went on top as suggested.  It was wonderful!  Even my in-laws thought so!  Thanks!

this recipe is very good & similar to the way my mother makes her stuffed pork chops. i enjoy cooking with aromatics so i increased the chopped onion & celery to about 1/4 cup each plus sprinkled in a bit more poultry seasoning. one more adjustment was to bake these (covered) at 325 degrees for 2 hours. the slower cooking process makes the pork so tender it falls off the bone. thanks tina!

I loved this recipe. However I did fine tune it a bit. First I used dry sherry instead of chicken stock or water. While browning the chops I added garlic then deglazed with wine. On top of the soup I added finely chopped carrots which not only gave the plate color but a nice crunch. My wife requested that this dish be placed into the rotation.

This was so good.  I couldn't wait for the bread to be a day old so I cut up the pieces and put them on a cookie sheet and put it in the oven at 200 degrees for about 30 minutes until it was hard and dried out.  It came out perfect!  My husband and my son loved it.

I made these for dinner tonight. I was tired of the cooking pork chops the same tow ways - fried or bbq'd - so I tried this recipe. They were delicious! I'm not a fan of stuffing, so I made one just with the stuffing on top for myself. For the rest, I butterflied the chops and stuffed them before I browned them. I sauteed the onion and used celery salt because I didn't have any celery. I used a mix of white and wheat bread and added a little of the soup to the stuffing mix. To me, the chops were just a tad dry (I usually brine them before I cook them to keep them moist), but otherwise they were excellent. I will absolutely make these again soon.

This is a very good recipe that my family really enjoyed. Don't let the 4 stars scare you away; it really is worthy of your selection - it just quite isn't the spectacular 5 that you would serve to company. I used Pepperidge Farm dressing in place of the bread cubes but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I did season the pork with s/p and powdered garlic before I browned it. The stuffing was very moist, so much so that I think I would cut the water down next time and probably use white wine in its place. This was quick and easy and inexpensive - good deal!

After every meal - I always ask my husband and girls "would you order it again?".... This one - I got 3 loud YES'S!  They loved this.  Perfect for a quick meal - minimal prepping and easy.  My 11 yr old participated and she enjoyed it more because she helped.  First, we lightly sauteed cut up celery, onions and fresh grated garlic in olive oil. Setting the sauteed veggies aside in another bowl, we browned 4 boneless pork chops in the remaining olive oil for about 2 min each side.  My chops were semi thick, not your average thick cut.  Then, my daughter put the onions, celery & garlic in the breading mix (beleive it or not, I had her use a box of Stove Top for Pork) and stirred in a can of Swanson's chicken broth (low sodium).  I placed the pork chops in a deep sided baking dish, put large spoonfuls of breading mix onto each pork chop and she poured the condensed cream of mushroom soup over the breading mix, we covered and baked.  OMG!  It was SO DELICIOUS.  We should have used two boxes of Stove Top... It was great.  Perfect amount for a family of 4.  Enjoy this tasty and quick meal!

This recipe is awesome.  I seasoned my chops before searing, took them out of the pan and sauted onion, celery and about 1/2 cup mushrooms in alittle butter and evoo. Instead of bread I used 3 cups peppridge farm seasoned stuffing mix.   I used about 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Cooked at 325 for 2 hours and it was delish.  What a great way to make chops.  Served with silver queen corn and grands!!!!

I tweaked the recipe quite a bit--doubled the stuffing, added more butter and chicken broth to stuffing--too much chicken broth actually, and it was way too soupy.  I thought I'd ruined it, but it solidified quite a bit as it cooled.  The idea was great--pork chops and stuffing.  It was even better when rewarmed, as the stuffing had firmed up quite a bit by then.  Actually turned out quite good.  Next time I would still add more liquid to stuffing, as I don't like it dry, but not quite as much.  Baked it at 325 degrees for two hours as others had suggested and worked well.  Will make it again.

Cooked this recipe tonight and it was a real hit! The family said it is a keeper!! I doubled the dressing, and used one can of garlic cream of mushroom soup, and one regular. The flavors are very good! I didn't measure the seasonings, just went by instinct using Italian seasonings also etc, and added just enough water to the soup to make it slightly fluid so it stayed on the dressing. Tasted divine! :)

Hubs and I are in the midst of a kitchen remodel we planned to be away from  for most of the process. We've traveled to and thru many states (road trip too) and have eaten more restaurant food than I care to think about.  Fine dining or fast food, it doesn't matter - neither is home cooking and we  have been craving it. I can only cook when we're at our second home in Naples, and now that we're here (briefly) I've finally had the opportunity. We're leaving again today, however, so we decided we wanted our "last supper" to be good old-fashioned comfort food.  These pork chops (with buttered noodles and green beans), I'm SURE, were designed to satisfy our cravings!  Pretty much a perfect recipe in my mind, on all counts - ingredients as well as cooking directions. And how clever but still common sense is it to just pile the stuffing on top of the pork chops rather than to try to stuff them neatly - and get enough of the good stuffing?  I was lucky enough to have good, homemade bread in the freezer  so I just cut it up into cubes and dried it out in a 200* oven for about a half hour.  Rather than the  water directed for the gravy I used white wine (Chardonnay), a little Worcestershire, and  fresh, sautéed mushrooms. To ensure the vegetables in the stuffing were cooked through,  I sweated them in the butter, adding mushrooms here too,  before combining  them  with the bread cubes. One full recipe was just right for our two large bone-in chops. And we cleaned up every bit of it.

I am rating this a 5, but I did shortcut this by using Stove Top stuffing prepared according to the box and then put on the pork chops and topped with the mushroom gravy.  They were delicious, easy and tender.  Thanks!

Absolutely 10 stars!  Best recipe I have tried on this site yet...I did a few changes per other reviews suggestions.  I cooked at 325 for 2 hours.  Uncovered during last 15 mins.  I seasoned chops with garlic powder, salt & pepper before browning.  I used 2" pork chops and cut a pocket to add some of the stuffing mix. Put the remaining of stuffing on the top of the chops and added sauce to the top.  I also used Pepperidge Farms small cubed bread crumbs and milk instead of water.  They were not soggy nor were they dry.  These were the BEST I have ever had!  You have to try it....

The correct temperature to cook pork to is actually 145 degrees. If you don't overcook it (to 170 degrees) these turn out very good and moist.

This recipe was awesome!  I followed the directions almost exactly except I added salt and pepper to the pork chops when I seared them and used the cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup.  The stuffing is so simple but so delicious at the same time.  Thanks!

My family loved this, i cut pockets and stuffed my chops then put the extra stuffing on top as the recipe calls for  (I used boxed stuffing) I also par boiled small to med. potatoes, i arranged my chops all around the sides of a large roaster (as i made 8 instead of 4) and arranged the potatoes in the middle and poured 2 cans of soup over all and baked as directed.  Big hit. Thanks!!

Tried this recipe last night for dinner.  Awesome is all I can say, my guys just couldn't stop complimenting the dinner enough.  We are total foodies and it takes a really outstanding recipe to impress.  So thanks for the recipe was a last minute rescue for me!  I added a few crunchy fried onions at the end just finished it off perfectly. Thanks again!

OH MY this recipe knocked our socks off! Thank you.. I used a package of cornbread stuffing, because I couldn't find bread cubes at the store (nor had time to dry out bread), still added fresh chopped celery, onion, poultry seasoning..Also used roasted garlic cream of mushroom, and added milk to it instead of water.. And, WOW. What a tasty dinner! We also used thin cut chops.. I baked some acorn squash to go along with it, and look forward to having this again! My Husband and I had one chop each, since it was soooo filling, and saved the rest for lunch the next day! Still as good as made fresh ^_~

Like many others, I also enjoyed this recipe VERY much.  I took some of the other suggestions, and doubled the stuffing portion, cut a slit in and stuffed the pork rather than put the stuffing on top, and since I'm not a mushroom fan, I used cream of chicken soup.  If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would!

This was pretty good.  I had butterflied, boneless pork chops so I just layed them open after they were browned, spread the stuffing over them and followed the directions pretty closely except I added more poultry seasoning, and some garlic powder.  Served with mashed potatoes and saute'd zucchini and onion it made a nice weeknight dinner.  Tina thanks for a nice recipe.

Very good dish! I made my basic Thanksgiving stuffing using apples, onions, celery and chix stock. But I followed everything else. Very good. I had some thick cut chops, so I did braise them well before putting in the oven dish. I did test the internal temp at 30 mins, but it needed a bit more time, so I uncovered them and baked for about 22 minutes longer.  They were juicy, the stuffing wasn't over-done, and the gravy was great. OH, I did double the cr of mush soup and used milk instead of water as so many of the other reviewers suggested.  There are left-overs for tomorrow, and we are happy about that!!

Very yummy!  Slight changes:  Used cornbread Stove Top stuffing, stuffed the chops & put rest of stuffing on top, doubled cream of mushroom soup for more gravy.  Only thing I would have changed otherwise, cooked at lower heat & a little bit longer.  Added to my favs!!

Oh, Goodness!!!! I have to say thank you for this wonderful recipe. I had given up on being able to cook a tasty pork chop but this recipe saved the day. I would not change a thing (except make more stuffing). I loved it, my mom loved it, and it mixed well for my autistic son!

Well I can now make Stove Top Stuffing! I used 1 and 1/2 inch  thick pork loin chops. I used other people's suggestions to sauteed the onions and celery.  I cut white bread iinto cubes and put them on a cookie sheet at 200 degrees for 20 minutes to make my bread crumbs. I mixed milk and ckn broth in the soup. It came out a little too thick.  I cooked them for 2 hours and they were very good. I will make them again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my brother's Birthday party. I browned the porkchops with butter, onions, garlic and fresh sliced mushrooms. I stuffed the pork chops and covered with the the mushroom and onions along with the soup mixture- used golden mushroom soup instead and it was very good. I followed another review and cooked for 2hrs. at 325. A very nice comfort food.

I was impressed with this recipe it was really good.I didn't stuff b/c pork chops that I had were not thick enough. I also used herb seasoned croutons (that all I had on hand). Mix the soup with milk not water and added a little garlic powder to the mix. Saute the celery and onions and added a lot more than 2 Tbsps.Everyone loved it,even my teen who hates pork chops.

I wish that I could give this 10 stars! the best stuffed pork chops I ever had were at the county fair and we have to stand in line for 3 hours to get one. I NO LONGER HAVE TO DO THIS! I made this recipe last night and now THIS is the best stuffed pork chop that I've ever had! I went on about how great these are to my mother, so now she is going to try the recipe. This recipe is a keeper! you HAVE to try them!

This was easy & WILDLY popular.
Used boneless pork sirloin cutlets (thick & on sale!), Kroger generic Stove-Top-type dressing (already had it at hand), added the 1/4 C. diced onion, 1/4 C. diced celery, 1 tiny tub of Knorr Homestyle chicken stock concentrate+fresh water and butter. Seasoned the cutlets w/black pepper, onion salt, poultry seasoning,and garlic salt w/parsley, before pan-browning both sides. Assembled all in a 9" x 13" glass baking dish and baked (covered) @ 325 degrees Fahrenheit for 1&1/2 hours. The "Welcome home!!!" aroma this dish generated while baking was wonderful beyond belief...totally disarmed Mr. Grumpy!! Thank you, Tina! This dish has become my "Most Requested" of all time! My family thinks I can cook, now! LOL!

This is an excellent recipe.  If I could rate it 10 stars I would because I have a tough crowd to please!  Using the market family pkg of assorted chops worked great for us along with doubling the sauce using whatever "cream of soups" I have available....delish!!!  I season my chops before searing just as a personal preference....these chops Rock!!!  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!!!!!

I have been wanting to do something different with pork chops lately and found this! I tweeked it a little. I used garlic instead of onions, I added a little extra broth, and an extra can of soup. I cooked it for about 40 min covered and another 10 uncovered. It turned out AMAZING!!! My husband is a very picky eater and when I can get him to eat something I know it's good!!! Thanks for the recipe! I will most definitely be making it again!

I am pretty new to cooking and made a couple of substitutions.  I used Turkey flavored Stove Top Stuffing instead of making homemade stuffing and for the gravy, I added a package of onion soup mix, sour cream and white cooking wine.  I loved it!

I didn't wait for day old bread or buy croutons-I used prepared boxed stuffing(Peppridge Farms) that I had on hand. The chops were juicy/moist and the flavor was excellent. DON'T SKIP browning the chops first! It not only adds flavor(above some other pork and stuffing recipes)it also helps seal in the juices to keep moist.I will definitely make again-MAYBE even use the recipe's stuffing recipe!It wouldn't be as quick-but it probably is even better!

5 Stars!! Awesome!!  I used Stove Top pork stuffing.  I browned up the pork chops and put them in the bottom of my 9 x 13 pan.  While the stuffing was cooking in the microwave, I chopped up some 1/4" pieces of a baking apple that I then mixed into the warm stuffing.  I put the stuffing over the pork chops and poored the mushroom soup/water mix over the stuffing.  YUMMY!!  This was my fast and easy version that I will make again and again!!!!

Was very good.  Instead of piling the stuffing on top of the chops though, I butterflied them and put the stuffing inside, keeping the chops closed with a toothpick on each side.

This is good.  It turned out that my bread had gone off, so I used some dried stuffing.  In the future I'll probably choose to use more soup for gravy, but it all turned out good.

we really liked this one a lot. I tried it with butterfly cut pork chops I got marked down at the meat counter and it was really good. I tried it later with two thin ones sandwiched together and it was also good, but don't overcook or they'll get tough if you use thin ones.

We thought it was delicious.....The chops were tender, as I had tenderized them a little bit while browning them in the skillet....Also, I added a few extra spices to the chops while they were browning. I went with Stove Top stuffing mix...So I was able to eliminate most of the ingredients. Still, tasted wonderful...I will make this dish again, and again..

Great pork chops, Tina. Perhaps a bit salty, but next time I will use reduced sodium soups. I, too, doubled the soups (using Crm Mushrm and Crm Chicken since I didn't have two the same) Used white wine in place of the water. Yummy. My husband is already requesting a rerun of this dinner. Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious!  As others did, I prepared a full bag of Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix (herb) with apples, sausage, celery and onion.  I stuffed the chops, browned them and then layered them on top of the stuffing that was left over. Pour over the soup mixture and bake for an hour, (have to add a little extra time because the chops are stuffed too) and your good to go! Excellent recipe!

Holy cow, these were good.  I made an extra batch of the stuffing, slit the pork chops, stuffed them and then put the rest on top.  Awesome, the family loved it

I've made this several times now and my husband and I absolutely love this dish.  We both like lots of "gravy" so I added a can of Golden Mushroom soup along with the Cream of Mushroom soup.  I've also made this in the crockpot and it has turned out beautifully.  I use milk instead of the water and if fresh mushrooms are on sale I add sliced fresh mushrooms as well.  This is our favorite recipe for pork chops.

I, too, did my own version.  I had a pork tenderloin I sliced into 2-inch pieces and then pounded each piece only a few times each, seasoned each and then a light dusting of flour before browning.  I had forgotten celery, so used celery seed.  I increased the recipe as I had about ten pieces of tenderloin so used Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Onion, thinned with the remaining chicken broth.  I sauteed the onion and mushroom before adding to the stuffing and seasoned the stuffing with fresh herbs from my garden.  Lastly, I had a few fingerling potatoes so I quartered them and added them to the pan before the soups.  Two hours at 325 did the trick.  This is a great option for pork.  Very delish!

Yum!! As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the stuffing and used plenty of onions & celery. Since I used the Pepperidge Farms seasoned bread cubes, I didn't double the poultry seasoning, thought it might get a little strong. I slit my boneless chops, stuffed them and browned one side in olive oil. I spread a little stuffing in the bottom of a 9x13 and put the chops on browned side up - looks nicer. Two hours, 325 degrees - perfect and delicious!

I have to give this one 5 stars, it was so amazing! 6 slices of bread it took for 3 cups.  I covered it and convection oven at 325 for 50 minutes, I slow cooked, didn't uncover it and the meat was falling off the bone.  Used thick pork chops and green onions.  My husband was amazed a pork chop could be so tender.  Definately a keeper this one! Thanks for sharing it

The recipe came out very good, I used sherry instead of broth, and it had excellent flavor. Next time I think I'll thin down the soup a little more, it was a little thick.

This was very good.  I used pepperidge farm cornbread stuffing mix and it turned out very moist.  The pork chops were also moist enough to cut with a fork.

Awesome meal... I cheated and used a packaged corn bread stuffing mix, and
then added the cream of mushroom soup with water.  IT WAS WONDERFUL!!

Made this as written except for doubling the stuffing and the gravy. I baked at 325° for 2 hours. It came out so tender and delicious.Worth more than just 5 stars. I would give it at least 7 to 8. And I will make this a regular meal. Thanks for the recipe.

I am always looking for tasty pork recipes as my husband is really picky when it comes to pork. I hit a homerun with this recipe, however! I used boxed cornbread stuffing mix that I had on hand and sauteed some garlic,chopped onion and Apple (1 Apple diced) and added to the prepared stuffing. delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious recipe but next time I will use thinner pork chops.  The real thick ones were a bit tough but tasted good. It could be I didn't cook  them long enough. I cooked at 350 for 1hr so so.  The stuffing with mushroom gravy over the pork chops was just delicious. I did add a little more celery and onion to the stuffing. Also I will mix milk instead of water to the can of cream of mushroom soup. Will definitly make it again...

I am certain that this recipe is spectacular as written. Any recipe is intended as a starting base and is open for adjustments according to one’s taste. I tenderized the pork chops with a needle type of meat tenderizing tool on both sides of the meat. I seasoned the pork chops with sea salt, freshly cracked black pepper and garlic powder before searing them in a skillet. I increased the sliced celery and the chopped onions to ¼ cup each and added a ½ cup of sliced white mushrooms. I sautéed the veggies in the skillet that the pork chops were seared in over low heat. I substituted 3 cups of herb seasoned Pepperidge Farms® bread cubes for the homemade bread cubes and heated the broth before mixing the stuffing. I used half of a soup can of milk instead of the water to blend into the soup.

This recipe was very good, first time that I have tried stuffed porkchops. Instead of using the bread cubes I used cornbread stuffing and but followed the rest of the directions and it turned out really good. My two young children that can be picky enjoyed it, especially the stuffing part!

I cut a pocket in the chops & stuffed them. It turned out well but next time I'll probably save myself the trouble & time & just bake the stuffing on top as directed. I added chopped apples & craisins to my stuffing mix. And, as others said, baked covered 325 1 1/2 hours.

My go to pork chop recipe is breading them with breadcrumbs & pecorino romano cheese.  And it's a good recipe.  But I was looking for something different and came across this recipe.  AWESOME!!!!!  I never really had bread stuffing growing up.  My family always made cheese stuffing.  But this stuffing is off the hook!  Make this recipe you will not be disappointed.

Yummy, easy, and fail proof.    I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used whole wheat toast.  Also I had to substitute cream of onion soup for mushroom.  I didn't have celery, so I threw in a little celery seed.    Dang!  If I can make that many changes and still have it turn out good, I'm impressed!  Just make sure there is enough liquid in the mix so the pork chops are bound to come out juicy.

I have been making stuffed pork chops for years and was pleased with the addition of the mushroom soup. It adds a lot of flavor. I'm not sure the searing of the chops is necessary however and may have slightly dried them out. Will definately make again without the searing.

So Never ask the hubby to shop for the items you need. LOL. I asked for cr. of mush I got golden mush. Asked for french bread got sourdough. I had to use them. IT WAS STILL SO GOOOOOD. I can not believe how tender the porkchops were. The stuffing was outta this world. Awesome dish!! Next time I will do the shopping though. Then we can see if it is as good with the written ingredients. I bet it will be!!!!!

Not really that great.  I used the advice of another reviewer and slit the chops and stuffed with cornbread dressing, secured with toothpicks, seared on both sides and then put them in the baking dish and poured the soup on top.  Just wasnt all that great.  Definatley not worth all the stars its getting.

Well Ms. Tina, what an absolutely delightful recipe.  I made a couple changes; brined chops for 2 hours, slit chops and stuffed them with pork dressing, put remainder on top.  A keeper and a repeat at out table for sure! Thank you for sharing.

Great dish, made it last week and my husband has requested it again this week. I didn't have any celery so I just used cream of celery soup and chopped mushrooms instead. I would recommend a little less broth or soup as the stuffing was a little too mushy for my taste, but the flavor was delicious!

Fantastic!  I've used recipes from this site many times, but this is simply the best one we've found.  The recipe is simple, easy to make and a real crowd-pleaser.    If you're entertaining, this one is sure to get rave reviews and look like you're a star chef!  Take the author's advise and double the stuffing mix.. you'll be glad you did.  We served garlic sauteed mushrooms and brussel sprouts for good color balance and flavor.

These were the most moist pork chops I have ever eaten! A few changes though... Despite being advised not to use sour dough bread in the intro, I did use it because it is what I had on hand.  It was wonderful!  We had to leave for my daughter's 2nd grade music program when these were done, so I shut off the oven and left them in to keep hot, which may be part of the reason they were so moist and tender.  My seasonings were slightly different because I didn't have poultry seasoning (used sage, thyme, salt and pepper) and I use more celery and onions.  I also added a can of mushrooms to the stuffing.  This is a keeper.

Made these the other night. I am not a pork eater, but DH liked them. There was to much liquid so will cut back on it next time. 
Here are the changes I made. Used boneless sirlion chops, sauted 1/2c each celery and onion in 1/2 cup butter then added to 6 cups dried stuffing. Also added 2 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 tsp sage to stuffing along with poultry seasoning (1/2tsp). Used 2 cans cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic 1/3c water and 1/3 c sherry. Will probably cut it back to just the sherry w/soup and 1/4c broth w/stuffing.
Thanks for the recipe!

Although this recipe rated 5 stars for ease of preparation, the taste was only 3 stars.  Recipes using canned cream of (anything) soup just never taste as good as recipes made with fresh ingredients.  Based on all the terrific reviews, I was hoping this would be the exception.  :-(

Sorry, but this one ended up in the trash.  Used Sam's thick cut pork chops and cooked entire meal according to direction.  Pork chops were way over cooked and the whole meal tasted like cardboard topped with stuffing and mushroom soup.  Even if this was not over-done I would never make it again.

Everybody liked this - I used boxed stuffing mix.  It was a little salty with the chicken broth, soups and boxed dressing - but overall a hit.

Very delicious and comforting recipe and something different to do with chops. The only change I made was using milk in lieu of the water. My truly wonderful hubby and children, who fortunately will try anything I make, really loved this meal. Thanks Tina!

Very good and very filling recipe.  Since cream of mushroom is an icky thing in my household, I subtituted cream of chicken and that worked just fine.  The porkchops were very tender and very yummy.

I didn't exactly follow this recipe - I used stuffing mix, and added in some scoops of apple butter along with the chicken broth. 

After browning the pork chops on both sides, I sliced them open in the pan and put the stuffing inside. 

Then I baked them at 400 for 10 minutes (probably 6-7 minutes would have been plenty).

It was AMAZING - the apple butter made it over the top. Next time, I'll add some chopped up apples, too!

Yum! I used a box of Stove Top and then added the other stuffing ingredients.  Turned out so juicy & flavorful!  Oh, also I used celery soup instead of mushroom.

Very yummy and quick. I couldn't wait for my bread to be day-old so I cut it into cubes and toasted it in the oven. With mashed potatoes and green beans, it was such a comfort meal.

This was way better than expected!  I am normally not a huge fan of pork, but this was amazing!  I used brownberry herb seasoned stuffing instead of breadcrumbs and seasoned the pork chops and the cr. mush soup with rosemary, garlic, and a little lawrys.  After getting over the initial shock of how good it was, I realized that it was a little on the salty side.  Next time I may use water for the stuffing and lay off the lawrys a little so it tames it down a little bit.  Otherwise it was very good.  I served it with steamed green beans with olive oil and garlic.  Mmm.

My husband and I thought this was fantastic! I used thick pork chops, split and stuffed with 'Stove Top Stuffing' before browning, then baked with additional stuffing like the recipe says. It was so good! It took a little longer to cook, about 10 extra minutes, but was truly moist and delicious! Umm, I will make again, thanks!

Really good, warm, comfort food.  I think they key is to make certain to brown the pork chops and the beginning to develop the flavor.  Instead of bread cubes, I used seasoned bread cubes.  For quick flavor, I used celery & onion flakes instead of chopped.  I also replaced the water with additional chicken broth.  Make certain to brown the tops in your last ten minutes.  :o)

Great recipe! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the pork chops were a little dry.  I browned pork chops with onion, celery and minced garlic.  I used box stuffing and added the onion, celery, etc. to stuffing mixture.  I stuffed the pork chops and laid them on top of the stuffing and spooned about 3/4 of the cream of mushroom soup on top.  Turned out great, anymore of the soup I think would have maid the stuffing to mushy.  Next time I will cook the at a lower temp for longer.

I too, was tired of the same old recipes with pork chops. I tried this last night and it is now one of my favorite. I did not change a thing to the recipe except to double it. My husband and mother-in-law loved it also. It is a keeper!

This is a great recipe to use for company.  It tastes like you fussed without having to.  Cube the meat before browning to allow for easier serving.  For the stuffing don't forget rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper and some chicken broth.

I made this for my boyfriend even though he said he didn't like porkchops and he loved it! I added dried cranberries to the stuffing which went really well with the pork and I just used stove top which came out great and was quick and easy! Love the recipe, will use it again!

Wonderful comfort food!  I needed the comfort and didn't really feel like doing a lot of cooking, so I used boxed stuffing.  I wanted lots of gravy so I used a can of mushroom soup and a can of chicken gravy.  I added a bit of beef bovril to adjust the color of the gravy.  This turned out to be a great family dinner, served with mashed potatoes and a veg. Thanks.

We love this recipe! I use whole wheat bread, so I have to increase the poultry seasoning to 1/2 tsp. before I can really taste it. Also, I don't brown the pork chops separately anymore -- I just skip straight to the oven and I can't tell the difference.

I made a couple small changes to the recipe, thanks to the suggestions of other reviewers - and this was fantastic! To save time, I used stuffing mix from a box instead of the bread cube mix.  It did make it too salty, so I'll likely try the bread cube mix next time.  I also followed someone's suggestion to slice pockets inside the thick pork chops and stuff them before browning in the skillet. It wasn't nearly as messy as I thought they would be.  This was the best comfort food we'd had in a long time! It took everything in me to keep from eating two chops myself!

I used Sage & Onion cubed stuffing rather than the day old bread cubes. We also prefer boneless meat, so used just regular thickness pork chops. There were 8 in the pkg, so doubled the stuffing part and also the soup on top I doubled. I also increase the covered cooking time by 15 minutes, and the uncovered cooking time by 5 minutes. It was very good, everyone liked a lot!!

Good but I agree with the reviewer that said it is no different than pork chops and stove top.

As with most pork chop recipes, these came out very dry.  I followed some of the suggestions such as cutting down on the water and using cream of chicken soup, and although the stuffing was very tasty, the chops overcooked.  And I used extra thick ones!  Would probably cut down on the cooking time on my next try.

Wonderful.  I used thick butterfly chops and stove top.  The end-result was a bit salty, so next time I'll have to figure out a way to tone that taste down a bit.

After cutting a pocket in the chops, I seasoned them to my liking and seared them on both sides.  I sautéed the vegetables in butter with a little of sherry.  After stuffing the chops, I made pork gravy to pour over them instead of the soup.  I just didn't care for the soup.  I think I might try the soup again with 1/2 cup of sour cream and some seasonings that I like that goes well with pork.  Probably will just heat the soup, sour cream, and water in the pan I sear the chops.

This was so good and so easy, great recipe.  I used a box of StoveTop Pork instead of the the bread crumbs, worked great and added a little more flavor.

The flavor of this recipe is really good.  I loved the stuffing on top of the chops.  I made this for my inlaws, they really liked it, as did my husband.  My kids didn't like it.   I thought the porkchops were a bit dry, but I had to use the thin boneless pork loin chops...so I had to cut the time of cooking down...and perhaps I didn't enough?  I will try again with thicker chops or chicken.  Leftovers were not good.  Stuffing got soggy and chops got dry.  Good thing there wasn't much leftover.

My family loved this!  Since my husband is gluten-intolerant, I used Rudi's gluten-free bread and Progresso's Creamy Mushroom soup.  I added extra onion and celery and Italian seasoning in the bread mixture.  I served this with roasted asparagus and everyone thought it was such a special dinner.  Thank you, Tina!

I made these chops for dinner last night and we thought they were just ok. I used a box of cornbread stuffing and cut a pocket in my thick chops and stuffed them as well as put stuffing on top. I had to use cream of celery soup because that's what I had on hand. The end result was alright, not offensive, but no wow factor.

This was really good. Even though I toasted the bread crumbs first, the stuffing got pretty soggy.It still had a great flavor though. Next time, I think I'll try cutting down on the mushroom soup and water mixture.

This recipe was ok I guess but I wasn't impressed. Based off of what others had said I thought this was goin to be the best pork chop dish but it wasn't. I might have made a mistake somewhere but I don't think so.

This was very good.  I made extra stuffing for additional side dish and the cream soup over the top was great.

I love this and so did the kids,I didnt stuff them.I browned the pork chops in olive oil and garlic, then I used pepperridge farms sage and onion stuffing mix.I melted butter and added onions and celery,for about 2 mins then poured on dressing in a bowl anded a cup of chicken broth and added scallions and poured on top of pork chops, and added a can of cream chicken on top and baked for 60 mins.HMMM Good the chops were juicy and the stuffing was so flavorful and I sauted some french green beans on the side excellent

This is a really good recipe. I never thought the cream of mushroom soup would make the stuffing so good! I thought it was odd that they are called "stuffed" pork chops even though you do not stuff them. I was looking for a traditional stuffed pork chop recipe but I'm glad that I came across this one. I'm making it for the second time tonight. I did not make any changes. Tonight I make extra stuffing, put it in a separate pan and we'll have it tomorrow with our ham.

Add a dollop of Orange Marmalade (more or less depending on your tastebuds!) to the stuffing. I added a little more salt to compensate. Apple Butter would taste wonderful, too! I mixed Pork Gravy with the C of M soup. Baked @ 325 for 1 1/2 hrs. YUMMY!!!!!!!

I made this this evening.My wife and kids say it is the best! I agree! Due to lack of ingredients I used a box of stuffing w/sage.I added one bullion cube /pork flavor to water.After stuffing chops,I sprinkled a rosemary/garlic spice on both side's and browned. Placed in baking pan,put remaining stuffing on top of each chop.Next I poured mushroom soup in pan.covered and baked till done.Uncovered and baked additional 10 mins. 
And watch the family devour it!

This received cheers from my husband and 5 children.  I added mushrooms and spinach to the stuffing mixture and used day old French bread that I put in the food processor.  I also had bought seasoned pork chops and put in flour, the browned in the skillet......served with asparagus...mm mm mm mm great dinner!

This recipe is a keeper.  Hubby told me it was "tasty" and I should make it again.  It made a very good gravy and I took the advise of other posters and made more stuffing. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy-yummy in the tummy! Didn't have everything to make the stuffing myself, so I used a fresh bag of Brownberry stuffing leftover from Thanksgiving. But it's close enough to a basic stuffing recipe that I've had before. Mom and Dad loved it!! Next time I'll make the stuffing.

Delicous.  A family fav.  I substitute chicken OXO for the chicken broth so I add a little extra water.  I also normally double the stuffing because it is so good! I add garlic powder to the toasted bread cubes as well.  This is a great recipe for chicken breasts as well.

Did this recipe with only 2 chops, same amount of stuffing, (doubled the onion, skipped the celery, double the seasoning) and I found I had to cook it for an extra 20 min. (1 inch chop) and the stuffing was a bit watery.  I'd still make it again my boyfriend loved it.

This recipe is good although a bit runny. I would omit the water and just top with the mushroom soup alone. Made the stuffing very soggy.

I don't understand the people that didn't like this recipe - they must have done something wrong.  This recipe was a winner with my family - I did alter it a bit though.  Instead of putting the stuffing on top I sliced the thick chops along the side with a small opening and stuffed it.  It was absolutely wonderful - my family wants me to make it again.  Thank you Tina...

My family did not like this one, but I did.  It had a little too much stuffing and was a bit rich for the qty of stuffing that it called for.  I will definately make this one again but will use less bread crumbs for the stuffing mixture.

Although extremely simple to make, it was quite bland.  I did add almost double the chicken broth because the cubed bread still appeared pretty dry when all was mixed together.  I probably will not make again.

My husband and I don't normally care much for pork, but this pork was the most tender we've ever had! I browned some garlic with the pork, omitted the water, and used cream of celery instead of mushroom. I put the meat in the middle of the pan with the stuffing on either side and covered just the meat with the soup. I would recommend using a little less butter, toasting the bread first, and adding parsley. Overall, will make again!

Sprinkled salt, pepper, and garlic on pork chops before frying since one of the reviews stated it was bland.  I didn't have any old bread so I used Stove Top stuffing.    My husband didn't think it tasted any different than cooking the pork chops and stuffing separately.  It was also more work than cooking them separately.

This was very good.  I used my own stuffing recipe that makes quite a large amount of stuffing.   I let the chops cook for about 20 minutes alone in the pan with the cream of mushroom soup mixture on them. Then, added my stuffing and cooked for about 30 minutes uncovered.  The chops were very tender, no need for a knife.  And the stuffing absorbed the mushroom soup on the bottom of the pan. It was very good!

This was a wonderful recipe, however i did add and change things up a bit. I used 2lbs thin boneless center cut porkchops (as i browned them i put a dash of salt, pepper and garlic powder), 21/2 cups seasoned packaged breadcrumbs with 1/2 cup of cubed bread, instead of mixing the water and soup together i mixed 1/2 cup of chicken broth with 1 can of cream of chicken soup. Before i baked it all i spikeled 1/4 cup of chicken broth over the dish so that the stuffing does not dry out.  i also left out the celery and onions because the packaged bread crumbs i used were already wonderfully flavored.  Again this was very tasty!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes!  I use bread crumbs (about 1 cup) instead of old bread, but leave everything else the same.  It's great!

YUM! I didn't have poultry seasoning so I just threw in a bunch of spices that I had on hand.  This dish is great-even better as leftovers the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

This tasted too much like stovetop stuffing. My family did not care for it. I will try it again, using cornbread crumbs instead of the bread cubes. I will add more onions, celery and poultry seasoning. I think this will help this recipe tremondously.

This recipe was OK. I found the pork to be somewhat bland, even with the homemade stuffing on top.  I am still searching for the perfect pork chop recipe.

Even with the changes I had to make it was excellent!!!!  I had to use fresh bread & would recommend deleting the chicken broth if you have to do this.  I increased the poultry spice, onion & celery, used white wine for the water & cream of chicken soup. I doubled the dressing & seasoned the chops with salt, pepper & garlic powder before sauteing.  Turned out wonderful & will definitely be made often at our house.

Oh, my goodness did my husband love this recipe.  He is usually very picky with how his pork chops are prepared, but he definately wants this recipe prepared again.

It was so easy to prepare and smelled great while it was cooking.

Anyone looking for a different way to prepare their chops needs to have this recipe.

I used a stick of French bread, sliced into half inch slices, and sliced those into 1/2" pieces. I put the bread pieces on cookie sheets and baked them for 20 minutes at 350 Deg.  Used 1/2 Cup Melted Butter, and 1/2 Cup of Chicken Broth. 1/2 Tsp of Poultry seasoning. I sauteed the onions and celery in butter to soften. Mixed the bread, seasoning, and wet ingredients slightly. I used thick cut chops, so I made a cavity in them, and added the stuffing mixture. after stuffing, I browned the pork chops on both sides and on the edges a bit. I sprayed cooking spray on the bottom of a glass baking dish, and added the remainder of the stuffing to the bottom of the pan. I placed my stuffed, browned chops onto the stuffing, and I used Milk to cut the Cream of Mushroom instead of water. I poured that all over the chops. Covered it with foil, and baked for and hour and 30 minutes at 325 Deg. Pork was fork tender and absolutely delicious. My wife says I can definitely make this again. Served with sweet potatoes, and steamed broccoli. Yum!

This is fantastic!  I added the celery and onion to the pan after browning chops, then deglaze with stock.  I needed more moisture and will add a bit more water to ensure the bread mounds over the chops!  Family wants this again this week.

This was SUCH  a deeeeelish surprise.  I was looking for something different to make for dinner and this did NOT disappoint.   I used some butter herb seasoned bread cubes (for the bread requirements),  I had bought it for turkey stuffing.  DOUBLE the bread cube /mushroom soup part of the recipe because everyone will want seconds on that!

I made this recently for some friends, and it was delicious! I too was looking for something different to do with pork chops, since I tend to do the same thing over and over. LOL I must say they thoroughly enjoyed it and raved so much that I made it for my family a couple days later. I did adjust it slightly, as I keep dried celery on hand, and I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the cubes. Thank you for sharing this!

I have to make a few adjustments. After you brown, bake at 325 degrees for 30 min, otherwise chops will be too dry.  As a really good chef told me once,' if you think your pork looks done, you have waited too long'!  These also need to be seasoned first before browned.  I made more dressing and stuffed them and closed w/ toothpicks I then topped w/ remaining.

Fabulous!!  I used the Pepperidge Farm bread stuffing & accidentally mixed the soup in with the bread mixture instead of pouring it over the stuffing.  It still was delicious.

Very tasty and I will make this again. But the chops were not tender and the stuffing mix suggested by other reviewers was too crunchy for me. Next time, I'll probably use two cans of soup, add a little more water, and cook longer at a lower temperature.

This was just OK for us.  I prefer my dressing without a can of soup dumped over it.  There were left overs which usually does not happen at our house and no one wanted to finish it off the next day.

Funny, I've made this for 40 years and thought I made it up.  LOL LOL  Yes, the stuffing can get soggy so I found it works better if you bake the chops and stuffing together, remove from pan when done,
then add the mushroom soup to the drippings.  Since the soup does not thicken enough for gravy, I add a small amount of flour to slightly thicken.  This has an great flavor and is perfect poured over the stuffing.  For added flavor add fresh oysters to the stuffing which provides another wonderful level of flavor(no fishy taste here).

Really enjoyed this recipe. Made it exactly as stated in recipe. The pork was moist and my family really enjoyed the soup part as it tasted like gravy..
I made this again tonight and did make a few changes due to what I had on hand this time I used butterfly pork chops and only had cream of chicken soup on hand and I preferred to have chicken over the mushroom soup (personal taste) this time around I also added salt and pepper for taste before putting the soup mixture on the pork chops. This is a great recipe and will continue to make this for my family. Its a keeper.

Guilty - I was short on time SO I have to say that I cheated and used Stove Top Corn Bread stuffing.  I also used extra thick chops which I slit and stuffed after browning with minced garlic and fresh ground pepper.  I added a red delicious apple, sliced thin on top of the stuffing and chunked around the pork.  As the pork was thicker, I needed to cook it longer.  It was very good.

LOVE this recipe! I wanted to try something new for me & my honey's anniversary! HE LOVED IT!!! So easy to make & SOOOO delicious! I had to change the recipe to use stuffing mix cause I didn't realize & needed day old bread. I sauteed the onions & celery. Once softened I added the stuffing mix, broth, a lil salt & cumin & BAM....DELISH! I am definitely making this again!

This was outstanding, we loved it!  I followed the recipe except for one thing.  I seasoned my pork with garlic salt and pepper before browning.  The only reason it didn't give it a 5 star is because the next time I'm adding more celery and onion.  Could barely taste them.  Otherwise, awesome.  My chops were extra thick so I did have to cook them an extra 10 mins to get the temp to 145.****Cooked again and this time I doubled the onions and celery....Yes, that did it.  Yummy!

used this recipe as a base to two huge stuffed (boned)pork chops I bought. I had to cook mine longer because of the size and the amount of gravy was perfect. I'd definitely use this again whenever I have stuffed chops

Me and my boyfriend loved this dish! I did make a few changes........i used boneless pork chops. I also used boxed pork flavor stove top instead of the day old bread mix. Instead of boiling the stove top in water I used chicken broth. Also i set my oven to 365 instead of 350 to cutdown some of the cooking time. The pork chops came out juicy and moist! He can't wait for me to make this again! Thank you for sharing ths wonderful dish with us!

I sauteed onion, garlic and mushrooms in a little olive oil, then added some stuffing mix and seasoned with a little sage.  Added a can of cream of chicken soup and then homemade chicken broth until I got it to the right consistency.  Topped the pork, which had already been seared off, with a generous portion of the mixture and then baked for about 30 minutes.  It was really delicious served with some mixed veggies.  Thanks!
Update:  Tonight I made the sauce by deglazing the pan with chicken stock and then adding the soup.  Delicious!

This recipe rocked!  I baked two large trays of chops, I had plenty to share with friends, and still have left overs for lunch and dinner the next day.  This one is a keeper.  The chops tasted better the next day.  Thank you for sharing!!

I used the store-bought stuffing and baked it for 2 hrs at 325 as suggested by so many others, but I was not happy with the outcome. The meat was moist on the outside, but dry towards the center. It could've used more stuffing, and maybe the home-made version would've been better, too.  I won't be trying this again though, sorry.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  We're not huge pork fans so that was part of the problem.  We thought it tasted okay but the appearance was awful.  Certainly won't make again.

This was really good.  I've never thought to make stuffed pork chops without actually "stuffing" them!  I was in a rush on a weeknight, so I just made a box of stuffing and it was still great.  Preparing it that way makes this a real easy weeknight meal.  Next time I will make it with my own stuffing and I'm sure it will be even better.  This one is a keeper!

What an outstandingly delicious dish.The stuffing was the best I ever tasted. The chops turned out succulent and moist. I wouls add that you must eityher buy Butterflyed Chops or suggest the chef butterfly the chops before stuffing. That partr was a little confusing to me til I figured it out.

These were great!  I used more a little more celery and onions, milk instead of water for the soup mix, and added dried cranberries to the stuffing for some sweetness and color.  Me and my boyfriend enjoyed it and we sure were full!

We thought this was OK.  (Husband would give 1/2 more of a star if he could!)  Easy to make.  Rubbed chops with seasoning before browning, but still found recipe to be bland overall.  Topping was nice.  Probably wont make again.

Picky kids didn't like the stuffing but that's not unusual. My husband loved it, so did I- definitely a keeper. Doubled the stuffing but not the mushroom soup, which was good because it was a tad mushy which was why it lost a star.

Tina, this was the first time I have ever made stuffed pork chops....this is a FANTASTIC recipe....Thank you!  I used thick pork chops, made a pocket in them then stuffed with filling.  I did make a few adjustments because I didn't have chcken broth but it worked great.

I appreciate reading all the previous comments. I did season the pork before browning with garlic and black pepper.  I also preheated the chicken/mushroom soup with sour cream and sherry in the hot fry pan.  Fortunately I had some holiday stuffing (the ONLY kind we like, I always make extra) in a FoodSaver in the freezer, so no stuffing prep! (I'm accepting bribes for THAT recipe LOL!)  I had 2 small boneless pork tritips that I flattened and simply made a sandwich with the stuffing in the middle.  Baked covered 25 minutes, uncovered 10 minutes and turned to broil for a couple more.  I heated some of the soup mix separately so as not to drown (and sog) the stuffing, mixing it back in the casserole dish and stirring before serving.  Next time my DH wants to add stuffing on top too (He does LOVE my stuffing!) This is a keeper, thanks Tina!

My hubby says this is the best stuffing he has ever had. I cut up bread cubes and toast them in the oven with garlic salt and parsley as a previous poster had suggested.  I also use chicken oxo rather then broth and I omit the poultry seasoning.  This is great with pork chops or chicken it really flavors the meat.

Very good recipe. In order to make the dish more true to it's name, I sliced a pocket into the pork chops and stuffed them as well as putting the stuffing on top. My husband who is not a huge fan of pork chops enjoyed this dish.

loved it and so did boyfriend. did not have poultry seasoning so added sage, rosemary and thyme. Had to be careful to not let stuffing into sause, or it became way too mushy.  So easy, just add some mashed potatoes and you'll have the perfect comfort food meal.

One of my favorite recipes growing up was Pork Chops in Cream Gravy.  This simpler recipe reminds me of the one my Mom used to make.  I will definitely make this again, but probably saute the onion & celery first.

This was really good.  I used apple juice instead of the chicken broth because I didn't have only a 1/4c of broth hanging around.  I was afraid the 30 minutes was going to not be long enough but they were perfectly done.  These were really thick also.

Very easy and the flavor of the dressing was perfect.  I did have a problem with the very wet consistency of the dressing...perhaps the bread cubes were not dry enough(?)

My family liked this dish.  I added rosemary and fresh portabella mushrooms to the stuffing mix.  Also, as I did not have cr. of mushroom soup, I poured some apple sauce on top of the pork chops. Something seemed to still bemissing. Maybe some white wime or vermouth?

Good, very tasty, but not much different than the good old fashioned ones with a can of soup.  I think I'll stick to the easier ones, and not miss these.

This recipe was so simple (and I scare easily in the kitchen) and it was SO good!  I made it for my boyfriend, who is super picky about food and he absolutely loved it!  I used the cream of chicken and the Stovetop pork stuffing as several people suggested and it was wonderful.  Thanks!

Made with Stove Top Stuffing and added celery and onion.  Makes a lot of stuffing but that is what Hubby likes.  Used milk instead of water and added 1/2 cup of milk to make more gravy.  
Delicious as original recipe or with adjustments.

Baked one large/thick PC already stuffed and added about a half portion of stuffing as spelled out in recipe. I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper and a little garlic powder. I had no poultry seasoning, so added salt/pepper with some herbes de provence. The mushroom soup I got did not require diluting with milk or water, so I used about half can as is for my reduced portion. It was actually easy and had great flavor, and will make it again with full recipe..

I made it using the Pepperidge Farms traditional stuffing recipe. Even easier! It was really nice, but I would say to add seasoning and/or salt and pepper to the chops before cooking. A bit bland, so had to add it after.

Yum! I used more celery, and included chopped parsley and mushrooms to the stuffing as well. In addition, when browning the chops, I used garlic powder, salt and pepper, and a bit of sage. Finally, instead of water, I used some some dry white wine with the soup for the sauce.

Meal is in the oven now. I would just like to know why the recipe called for 3 cups of bread stuffing if you're only going to use a  1/2 C of stuffing on top of each pork chop ??? What am I supposed to do with the other 1  1/2  cups ??? My pork chops were thicker so I will add some more time to compensate. Didn't know what to do with the extra stuffing ??? so I piled it on top and am hoping for the best.

Followed  another revierer,s suggestion and baked for 2 hrs. stillwere not done. added some orange juice and water and cooked  it on top of stove for another hour. finally edible but probably won,t make again, alto taste was very good.

I made this today.  I had boneless thick cut chops.  I stuffed the chops and surrounded them with additional stuffing, with gravy on top.  Baked 2 hours at 325.  They were so delicious and tender.  I will make them again.  So yummy, thanks for a great recipe.

I actually love this. I did add in a few spices such as rosemary, thyme, garlic powder when making the stuffing.  We'll definitely have it again but I need to cut the sodium down. I had to use mashed potatoes smothering it to diffuse it a bit.

Will probably use half of the mushroom soup or add in a plain gravy. We'll see how it comes out next round but I'm not giving up on this because it was so good.

I used Stove Top but doctored it up with celery, onions & chicken broth.  I also used cream of celery instead of mushroom soup because hubby doesn’t care for mushrooms.  Cut the recipe in half because there are only two of us.  Two thumbs up for this recipe.

Substitutes - white wine for water, Pepperidge Farms Herb dressing for day-old bread cubes and cream of celery soup for cream of mushroom. Added - apple, mushrooms and walnuts, plus minced garlic when browning pork chops. Served it with Allrecipes.com fantastic Creamy Mashed Potatoes II and asparagus with hollandaise sauce. I started cooking about six months ago because I work from home and my wife works at the Alzheimers Association. I almost always use Allrecipes.com and make additions from favorable reviews. Thanks to everyone that comments. Jack K. from St. Louis.

Wow!  We love these pork chops.  I used very thick bone in pork loin chops and they came out so moist and tender they practically melted in our mouths.  The flavor of these chops is heavenly.  I didn't have any croutons on hand so I simply made some from day old bread.  No big deal and well worth the little extra time it took.  You can bet we will be making this dish again and again in the coming years.  Thanks for sharing with the rest of us who never knew how good stuffed pork chops could be.  Also love the fact you can bake it instead of standing over a hot skillet.

I made the stuffing using leftover biscuits and cornbread from a breakfast and supper a few days prior.  Next time I'd double the stuffing. I used a prior reviewer's suggestion to bake at 325 for 2 hours but should have cut that to an hour or so, because my chops were boneless and ended up a little dry for my liking.

Delicious! We will make this one again, for sure. Someone suggested sauteing the onions and celery first, Great advice. Also sauteed garlic with the pork chops. My husband deglazed the pan with wine and poured the mixture on top of the pork chops. Perfect!  We also used Pepperidge Farm Herb stuffing mix left over from Thanksgiving instead of the

Made this pretty much exact to the recipe.  Followed the advice of others and made extra sauce with milk instead of water. Also added a piece of Swiss cheese on top of the chop, and under the dressing.

Wife has asked for it to be made again :)

The pork chops were tender but we felt the flavor was lacking something.  It had 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning in it, maybe it needs to be increased or add some sage.  Truly not sure.

This is a winner! I am always looking for something different to do with pork chops and this didn't disappoint!  I followed the recipe, except I used Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Bread Crumbs, and instead of water mixed with the soup, I mixed chicken stock. The pork chops came out moist and tender, which is my biggest complaint with pork. Really good recipe, and not hard or time consuming.

pretty yummy recipe, super easy to prepare . I had some left over stuffing mix in the freezer, so I used that. Didn't have the soup, but had some turkey gravy mix, so used that. I love recipes that you can improvise on.

It wasn't bad but the chops were a tad bland even with salt and pepper. Next time I believe I will try seasoning salt or Tony Chachere's.

Delicious!  My kids hate gravy, one hates stuffing, yet this meal was definitely a family favorite!  I followed directions exactly, but I took a few reviewers' advice and used white wine I had on-hand with the mushroom soup and it kicked up the flavor just perfectly.  We all loved this meal, served with Brussels Sprouts to get us all set for Fall's arrival!

This was easy and just great!  I used unsalted butter, since the soup had a lot of salt.  Also I cut 1 inch chops off a pork loin and used them.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  This is quick, easy and quite tasty!

this is was horrible.  It needs to be in a crock pot.  Meat is tough as dog hind.  Anyone who cook thick pork and make it tender in 30 minutes is crazy.  Worst dish I ever made.

Tastes like thanksgiving.  (I used flavoured bread crumbs, bc that's what I had).  You can use more of the same spices to make it more flavourful.  I would make this recipe again.

Used onion soup mix as my gravy base (thickened w/flour).  Did not sear off chops first, just baked for 40mins at 355 covered with foil, then flipped and cooked for another 20mins at 325. Turned out very moist!  Didn't use gravy while cooking, just as finisher/topping for the chop & mashed potatoes.   Husband and father in law LOVED it! (I don't eat pork, but they def want me to make it again).  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My picky husband says this can go on the repeat list. I used the boxed stuffing and used Golden Mushroom soup (Campbells) because I like it better. Chops were very moist and tender. Very pleased with the results.

Delicious! Made this for dinner tonight and my husband and daughter loved it!! I doubled the recipe because I had 8 pork chops and have to confess used box stuffing so omitted poultry seasoning. Came out wonderful. Daughter asked if I'd always make pork chops this way. Will add this to my dinner rotation. Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good. Next time I will try a boneless thick chop instead. My butcher was out and I had a difficult time making a pocket in the chops, as I wanted them "stuffed" and not just on top of the chops

Pork chops were very tender and moist, flavors were very good. Dressing was good and we ate it all. I need to do a little tweeking to get the dressing to our taste. Will make again.

We really enjoyed this. I find pork bland so I am always looking for ways to jazz it up. I added two tablespoons of small diced apple to the stuffing to give it a little sweetness. I also used the chicken stock instead of water for the stuffing.

A great recipe!  I used Stovetop Cornbread Stuffing instead of bread cubes and it turned out great.  I will definitely be adding this to my regular sunday dinner rotation. 

 Watch the cooking times with this recipe, depending on the thickness of your meat you may have to add 10-15 additional cook time to make sure your meat thoroughly cooks as I did.

Great Fall meal.  I use Pepperidge Farms Traditional stuffing mix, using sauteed celery and onion, then adding chopped fresh parsley and a chopped raw apple.  I also put the soup mixture over the browned chops and then put the stuffing on top of that.  This keeps the stuffing from getting soggy and allows it to brown up  a little when you remove the foil.

This is an excellent recipe! My family loves it. I do however hate canned creamed soups so I make my own. I have a very simple recipe. 2 tablespoons butter melted in a sauce pan. 3 tablespoons flour whisked in and browned. Slowly add 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Then slowly add 1/2 cup of milk. Salt-and-pepper and thicken.  I also used my cast iron skillet which makes everything better!

Made this tonight. I was being extra lazy so I just made up some stove top savory herbs stuffing and used that instead. I seasoned my chops with garlic, onion powder, greek seasoning, and seasoning salt then browned them. Afterwards i did as the directions said minus the cheat stuffing and uncovering  for 19 minutes so the stuffing could get crispy. This is so delicious!

I made this tonight and my husband even had seconds! I used a stovetop dressing just adding extra celery and onions. Since I don't like too much mess, I cooked onions and celery in my cast iron fry pan, and then added to stuffing in a bowl. Frying pork chops in the cast iron, putting stuffing on top of each chop, then mushroom mixture over all. Covered with foil in 350 degree oven for 1 hour made them really tender. making this a 1 pot meaty meal I just added salad. This is a DEFINITE repeater!

I used stove top stuffing instead of bread cubes, was easy and delicious. We loved them! They also reheat nicely in the microwave so you can go ahead and make more even if there is only 2 of you.

I changed the method to make the pork chops "stuffed". I cut a pouch into each pork chop, seasoned them with poultry seasoning, pepper and salt free Emeril's Essence, filled the pouches with stuffing, browned both sides of the pork chops, combined the soup and water in the pan with a whisk, I needed 1/2 cup of water, added pepper and garlic, covered and baked for about 20 minutes. Hit with the family!

My family loved this. It was excellent comfort food. I made exactly as described except used packaged seasoned stuffing mix with added onions and celery. It was remarkably easy and a great crowd pleaser. Cooking for 40 minutes did overcook my chops a bit so I'll shorten the time or use a lower temp  next time. Mmmmmmm! Family dinner keeper! Thank you!

I only had thin chops that where boneless so I used those and only cooked them covered for 20min and uncovered for 10. Fantastic taste! I also  pre seasoned w/a bit of garlic and pepper and used store bought stuffing. This had fantastic taste and my 8 yr old gave it 2 thumbs up.

I made this for dinner tonight. I usually split the pork chops and place the stuffing inside, but the pork chops end up dry and the stuffing hard. This was a completely didn't result. Not only was the pork chop moist and tender, the stuffing was soft and the flavor was great. I made mashed potatoes to go with it and will make this again. Thank you for the recipe!

Wow! This recipe is awesome! I used Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix instead of making stuffing from scratch. It was quicker and just as delicious! I made 6 pork chops so 1 bag of the stuffing mix was perfect. For 6 chops I used 2 cans of the mushroom soup. So excited to have found this recipe!

This was amazing! And so easy to prepare. I did substitute a box of seasoned cornbread stuffing for the mixture made by scratch in the recipe. It didn't take away anything from the flavor. And the gravy! Delicious. Try this recipe. You won't regret it.

My company really enjoyed this dish.  I had to bake the cubed bread to make it stale because I didn't have time to let it sit.  My family is not a fan of mushrooms so I was nervous using the cream of mushroom soup but, no guts, no glory, I used it and they never knew what it was.  I would make this again but next time I would bake at a lower heat and for a longer time to make the pork chops more tender.

I followed this recipe as is (except I used 3 chops instead of 4 as we only needed a chop each for dinner and one left over for his lunch) and were wonderfully delighted.  Both my husband and I loved it! No changes needed as far as we were both concerned.  Very simple to make.  This will definitely be in our cold weather hearty meal rotation.  Thanks for the share!!!

Mine did not taste too good & looked disgusting. I think a simpler recipe would have been better for my family.

Very good, except I adjusted the recipe - Added salt, pepper and garlic powder to chops before browning.  Used regular cut pork chops instead of thick - should have cooked less time. Used "Herb" Pepperidge Farm stuffing.  Sauteed chopped onion and about the same amount of chopped bell pepper, but not the celery. (celery was still a bit crisp and it was really good.)  Used "Roasted Garlic" cream of mush. soup.

I was looking for something simple and easy.......boy did I hit the right thing with this!  Thank You!  I only had two pork hops, so what I did was thaw four chicken tenderloins and divided everything between two dishes.  Since it's just the two of us, it worked out great.  I didn't have to cook on another day.  :-).  I did add extra mushrooms to it, I also added chia & flax seeds to the bread mixture for that little extra fiber.   IT was fantastic!  Both dishes!   Thanks again!

After combining suggestions and ideas from other reviewers of this recipe, this is now one of the best recipes I have in my arsenal.  My family loves these chops.  I butterfly thick pork chops and fill them with the stuffing before I brown them in a pan.  I have used the 'from scratch' stuffing and on busy/lazy days I have used Stove Top.  Either way it is good.  What bit stuffing does not fit inside the chops I squeeze in around the chops in the baking dish before pouring the soup mixture over the top.  This is an excellent recipe.  Thank you Tina. :)

I doubled the soup and mixed it with some chicken broth, but beef would work too. Used left over stuffing frozen from Christmas and seasoned the chops with salt free seasoning, garlic powder and thyme. Delish served with jasmine rice, apple sauce on the side. Yummy, easy, and fed 5 people with enough for 3 more servings!!

I really enjoyed this! Our chops were so thick, I butterflied them and put the stuffing in the middle instead. And I baked at 375 for 30 and then 15 minutes instead. Delicious!

We cheated and used Stovetop stuffing (my husband and I both work 11-hour days so making things homemade/from scratch is a challenge!), but otherwise, this was a great idea and made a delicious meal!

This ended up being fantastic. I was missing celery and had to substitute bread crumbs for a stuffing mix but what a great recipe. I also added bacon to the stuffing mix. This is going to be a go to meal for us for a long time!

I only changed a few things used stove top stuffing because it was quicker & added a packet of Lipton onion mushroom soup mix w 1/2 can of water instead of milk. Gravy had a very good taste.

This was very good and easy.  I bought my bread 3 days earlier and I just chopped it up when I was ready to use it.  I seasoned my pork chops and added sage to the bread mixture.  I will make this again

Basically, I think this is.a great recipe, but it definitely needs adjustment to the seasonings to avoid the bland label. Unless you are on a strict salt free diet, pork needs salt to bring out its flavour.   Not only did I salt and papper the pork, but  i added both to the stuffing as well..    The 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning looked like an error to me.  I sprinkled  in dired savoury, rosemary, sage and thyme, probably 3/4 tsp total.  it was very flavourful and not bland.

The recipe lends itself well to adjustments.    I have made it three times now.  First with pork chops, then with medallions of pork tenderloin (much better). Adding sauteed onions and mushrooms on top of the browned pork  is a great addition as is adding sherry or wine to the mushroom soup.   Next time I will make it with chicken breast... Not whole,  but cut in pieces, dredged with flour, salt and pepper and browned.  I think it will be delicious!

I followed the recipe verbatum (although I doubled the stuffing).  Next time I make this I will cover the pork chops with the cream of mushroom "gravy" THEN put the stuffing over that.  The pork chops had absolutely no flavor (and I seasoned them with salt, pepper, and some garlic powder while browning).  The bland pork really ruined this recipe for me (the stuffing was delicious though!)

Very tasty... A little salty but that may be my bad because I season the chops as well as season the gravy/soup concoction.  Green beans for the side also next time I'll leave a little gravy aside to drizzle on them when there done because the gravy you use to bake them ends up  thinning  out  due to the steam

This was great.  Of course, I added more poultry seasoning as I love the flavour of stuffing.  The chops were in the over for about 65 minutes in total.  This would be great with chicken breasts as well.  Will try that next time.

I fixed this tonight for dinner and we loved it! The only change I made was using bagged prepared stuffing mix because I had some. I always have to look for some without MSG and I used the Sage flavored. So good! I think I could even make this in the crock pot. Next time I will try it. Thanks Tina!

Delicious pork chop recipe. I placed the stuffing between two thinner boneless pork chops and tied them together with kitchen string, browned them on both sides and continued with the recipe. I reduced the salt due to dietary restrictions and substituted potato water (from making mashed potatoes) for the water. Added to my favorite recipe binder. Thank you for posting.

Normally I wouldn't post a review if I made changes to the recipe, but this time the changes were inadvertent, and it turned out good.  Turns out my chops were the thin kind, so I put the stuffing on top and broiled them after the foil came off.  Also, I thought I had mushroom soup, but I didn't, so I just made gravy from the floured and browned chops.  Turned out good!

Delicious!! I used bread crumb instead of bread cubes and a bit more onion and celery. It was fantastic, and so easy to make.

This is a great base recipe. I made it for dinner last night and everyone loved it! Being from louisiana, everyone I cooked for liked spicier food so I tweaked it just a little. Before browning my pork chops, I seasoned them by rubbing steak rub on both sides. For the dressing, I used Italian bread crumbs then added garlic and Italian seasoning and Tony's Chachere.  All I had was vegetable broth and I can't Believe it's not butter and both of those worked out great. Will definitely be added to my meal planner!

I made this a few days ago for the family. I read many of the reviews and added more celery and onions. Then I really felt creative and stuck in a bunch of baby carrots. The whole family really liked it although I found the stuffing a little too wet--but no one else thought so!

This one of my favorite recipes.  I always make much more stuffing than will fit and put it around the chops in the baking dish because it's my favorite part.

I made some of the recommended changes; browned seasoned chops first, sauteed onion and mushrooms.  I wish I'd had time to let it bake longer to get more tender chops, but it was still quite tasty.  Served with mashed potatoes and sucotash.
