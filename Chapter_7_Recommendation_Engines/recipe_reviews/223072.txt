These were awesome!!! They had just the right amount of seasoning, so it wasn't too salty (which is what I was afraid of). My husband said we are never ordering popcorn shrimp from a restaurant again lol.

Very tasty fried shrimp from a very nice recipe I will save. I followed this recipe with one change to technique only. Instead of adding the seasonings to the final breading, I mixed the seasonings together in a little dish and tossed it with the raw shrimp before I started breading them. That way non of the dried herbs get "burned" by the frying process. The seasonings are hydrated by the moist shrimp and protected by the coating. The seasonings cook from the inside instead of getting fried from the outside which results in richer flavor.

Great stuff! I substituted Panko for the bread crumbs. Gives it a wonderful crunch. Also put them on a wire rack with paper towels under it. That way they stay nice and crunchy.

This is so good! My husband and I made a few changes. We mixed the flour, bread crumbs and spices all in one bowl. We didn't have any eggs, so we dipped the shrimp in Pesto Parmesan Salad dressing, and then in the flour mixture and deep fried. They turned out so well! A new favourite and so easy!

Made this recipe for a Christmas party and everyone loved it!!!! I followed the recipe exactly as it says above and it was a huge hit! If possible - buy the shrimp already peeled to speed up the process!

Excellent! A little time consuming but worth it. I didn't use the 4 cups of oil it called for. I only used 2 and it turned out great. Watch closely for it can burn easily. My 3 year old even liked it!

Excellent! Better than any restaurant! I cut up some big shrimp we had to make popcorn style. I made bread crumbs using left over hot dog buns. I toasted them on a 200 degree oven for about an hour and then ground them in the blender. Very kid friendly recipe too!

So delicious! The only thing I did differently was adding lemon to the milk and egg mixture.

These were really good!  I accidently tweaked the recipe by forgetting to add the milk to the egg mixture which didn't hurt a bit. I did have really big shrimp so I cut them into pieces made for the perfect bite.  Definitely a keeper recipe here!!

Absolutely perfect popcorn shrimp! Follow the recipe to a tee and you won't be disappointed.
The seasonings are the perfect balance and the crunchy breading makes it over the top.
My wife says I will be making this meal frequently.

Used larger shrimp and panko.  Not sure I would use the panko again.  But they came out delisous anyway.  And cooked to perfection.

My husband and love love this batter - I have used it for shrimp several times but I would also use it for scallops or maybe even some fish fillets - the only change I make is that I use panic crumbs in instead of plain bread crumbs - I am sure it would be great mixed half and half as well

Simple and easy recipe to dress up your shrimp, used Italian and Parmesan  bread crumbs. Great as an appetizer, street tacos and mixed with scallops dressed up the same way in burritos and over pasta. Thanks a bunch.

Tasty little critters! I had to make a second batch so I think everyone enjoyed them.  Next time I think I will bread the shrimp, cover and put in refrigerator for couple of hours to let the breading set a little better

I used panko bread crumbs for some extra crunch.  I Will definitely make this again, but next time I will omit the salt...it didn't need it.  I served it with a sweet and spicy sauce made with orange marmalade and siracha.  My family loved it!

This is very easy and turned out great. I used panko for some shrimp and bread comes for some and both ways were fantastic. My 5 year old helped by tossing the shrimp into the flour and then into the egg while i did the rest.

Ok, so I had to improvise a bit. I only had panko bread crumbs, so I used those. I didn't do parsley and only a small amount of basil, because my kids don't like flecks of green. I decided at the last minute to make it more interesting for my husband and myself to put over rice and drizzle with soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce. Added some edamame and toasted sesame seeds.   This made the whole family happy, which is hard in my house!

I used panko and the shrimp were nice and crispy  and looked beautiful. However; I found them to be quite salty.  To be fair, it may not be the recipe's fault - when I read the ingredient list on the shrimp package, they had added salt so that may be why.
