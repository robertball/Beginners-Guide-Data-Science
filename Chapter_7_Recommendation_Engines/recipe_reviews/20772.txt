This was ok on it's own, but true Mexican tamale meat has a few more ingredients in it. I used this basic recipe but added 3cl. garlic, cumin, oregano, chile colorado, and I used chicken broth instead of water. It was pretty good, but next time I'll throw in a chipotle chile with mole for a little smokey flavor. This is a great basic recipe to build upon!

I cooked this for use with tamales, but my children were so enticed by the smell, they kept eating it and wouldn't leave it alone!  They just LOVED it, plain.

This recipe is as close as you can get to authentic...without flying to San Antonio. The recipe works very well with beef.

This tastes really good.  I preferred the pork to beef in tamales when I made both.

What a great recipe! This is easy to make and good in corn or flour tortillas with a little hot sauce. My family loved it!

Very nice, very simple.  Just ate it in wraps with mesclun and tomatoes.  I cut up the onion, not even realizing the recipe didn't call for chopped onion.  Will leave the onion in one piece next time!

This is pretty much how we usually make our pork for tamales but then the pork is mixed with chili sauce, green chiles and cheese so the pork itself doesn't need to be highly seasoned.   I question the amount of pork for 16 servings.  Is this supposed to be 16 tamales?  You might be able to get 16 tamales out of this 1 pound of meat but I doubt it. I usually do 10 lbs at a time.  When we are making tamales we don't just make a few.

I have never embarked on the task of making "authentic" Mexican tamales.  Although I am Puerto Rican, I want to try my hand at making these to expand my culinary skills and experiences.  Based on other comments here, I will give this, untried-as-of-yet recipe a 4-star rating.  The comments seem quite reasonable and since I've known my way about a kitchen, seem perfectly valid and justifiable at a 4-star rating at this time.  I hope to someday soon, add my photos of my first tamale attempt.  Wish me luck!

This recipe was so easy to make. I added cumin and chicken bullion and used my Insta Pot to cook this. I made Tamales with the shredded pork. OMG it was so yummy.
