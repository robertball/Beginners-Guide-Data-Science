This recipe turned out really well. After adding the 10 oz. of broth and the 1/2 cup of water, there wasn't enough liquid to cover the potatoes while simmering. I added half a carton of chicken broth, along with some extra cinnamon and red pepper flake. My boyfriend and I liked it, but we agreed that it was a little bland. Next time, I'll add salt, pepper, and more garlic. The sweet potatoes were perfectly cooked, tender without being squishy. Yum!

YUM! although this recipe sounded a little odd, it was absolutely delicious. I added about a tsp of brown sugar and a whole tsp of cinnamon, as well as a little extra pepper and nutmeg to boost the sweet potato's flavor. cherry tomatoes work just as well as one large tomato, just make sure to use a heaping handful. I also substituted low sodium organic vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make this vegan friendly. i'm going to make it again for Thanksgiving!

I had all of the appropriate veggies at home and wanted something new to do with them. This fit the bill perfectly! The only modification was to use 1 1/2 cups of Organic Vegetable broth as the liquid. Thank you for a unique and wonderful stew that will be made often!

It was a cold, rainy night and my husband was coming home wet and miserable. As soon as he hit the front door and got a wiff of what's cooking, his demeanor changed. He took time to email the recipe to his vegetarian friends after wolfing down half his plate. (They'll work out the chicken broth.) I had to sub petit cut canned tomatoes and frozen spinach and it turned out fine. It's a great meal and we can't wait to have it again.

Excellent recipe.  Used dried chick peas and black beans that I soaked.  Placed all ingredients in crock pot for the day.  Also omitted the chicken broth (to avoid msg) added some more salt and cinnamon.  Used swiss chard only because I didn't have spinach.

Very good, especially considering how nutritious it is!  I didn't have red pepper, so I used paprika - as I made it, I thought it could use a little more umphf.  Perhaps the pepper would have helped; I may experiment with other spices in the future.

I loved this recipe! Unique flavors, I was able to use up the 1 1/2 sweet potatoes and fresh spinach I had in the refrigerator. Also, we love vegetables in general. I added diced chicken when sauteing the onions and garlic--I omitted the water and just used the broth. Sweet and spicy--a nice combination of both! You can "up" either one according to your taste!

I put a four sliced chicken breasts into this stew along with the given recipe. 

This stew is ok.  The broth is relatively bland but if you add some spices (sweet basil, cumin, coriander), heat (habenero or serrano, I could barely notice the crushed red pepper), and salt (so important, as I cannot stress enough how the broth tasted like water).

Note that I increased the amount of red pepper by 50 percent and used the specific campbell's 10.5 oz chicken broth.  This stew must be infused with intense spices and sensations.  Even when done, the character of the stew is ambiguous.  A blank slate for your inventive or conservative spicing!

I recommend cooking this stew as given in the recipe (the cinnamon and vegetables makes your house smell amazing) and then spicing afterwards to taste.

A keeper! One of the best recipes I have even found on this site. I veered slightly off the recipe and added more raisins, used canned tomatoes and frozen spinach as that was what I had (I'm sure fresh is better but this was a great dish for a rainy night.)  Absolutely delicious with short grain brown rice -- and very healthy as well. Yummy and filling. Can't wait to make it again!

I substituted "no chicken" broth for campbell's as well. It turned out great. So easy! Very flavorful too, I didn't add any salt or extra seasonings.

This was delicious. I made it vegan by using veggie broth instead of chicken. I also omitted the oil, increased the broth to about 24 oz, omitted the tomato (didn't have one), increased cinnamon and red pepper to 1 tsp each, and used frozen spinach instead of fresh (that was all I had on hand). We loved it. A great and unique flavor combination.

It was very good and filling!  I served it over sticky rice.  Dearest hubby doesn't like exotic stuff like raisins in anything but cereal so I had it all to myself (the rest is in the freezer for future lunches). I was missing spinach; substituted one large tomato for a large handful of cherry tomatoes; used my own chicken stock and didn't use any water; and I also used almost a tsp of cinnamon and pepper flakes.  I agree that nuts could be good in it too.   Thanks for the recipe!

Stew eaters had mixed views. No one disliked it but no one loved it. It does have a unique flavor but triggered more of a ho-hum reaction rather than wow. Will not make again.

I have made this recipe over and over again.  Change the broth to veggie (or just use water) and it is a one of my favorite plant strong meals.  Freezes well, too.

I made this without the spinach (didn't have any on hand) and it came out well, though I do think that the spices could be increased by half. Served it on top of couscous, delicious!

I LOVED this recipe.  I am a vegetarian so I used Vegetable broth.  I use Better than Boulion paste.  I did 1 Tablespoon to 10 ounces of water to make it condensed and then added the extra half cup water as the recipe called for.   I also am not a fan of raisins so I used Craisins instead.  The flavor was OUTSTANDING!

super yum. diced onions, cubed sweet potato, doubled cinnamon, add salt and pepper, and used 2 cans of chicken broth. I was worried about the raisins, but it really added a great flavor, so definitely add them!

I love this recipe. I have made it several times. I usually substitute butternut squash for the sweet potato and use canned tomatoes instead of fresh. I have substituted swiss chard and kale for the spinach depending on what I have on hand. I leave out the red pepper because I do not like spicy foods. I also frequently add some cooked chicken or pork to increase the protein. It is very flexible recipe and delicious every time I make it. So healthy and low calorie.

This was amazing!  I and my family loved it. I added some salt and a bit more crushed red pepper and twice the amount of garlic. I also added 2 smoked hocks and some leftover turkey. There was tons of flavor. This is a definate keeper.

I rarely rate recipes but am making an exception on this one.  Simply delicious! I made it as written except added a bit more crushed pepper and salt/ ground black pepper to taste. The broth after cooking was heavenly. I love that it's so healthy too!

This was extremely unique and really quite tasty.  The only big change I made was that I added black beans as well since I had some left over from another recipe.  I have to admit that I was really unsure about adding the raisins, but they were such a great addition, I'm glad I didn't skip them.  Thanks for posting!

I though I was going to meet resistance with this meal. My 4 year old walked into the kitchen saying, "Dinner smells delicious!". Everyone, including my 1 year old gobbled up their entire meal. The only thing missing was the perfect side dish.

Yum! I love all the healthy veggies in this.  Such a great way to get lots of nutrients! I subbed garlic powder to taste because i didn't have any fresh garlic on hand, and I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato because they were expensive and small at the market. Last, I added some simple pork meatballs because my DH claims he "won't feel full" if there's not meat in a dish--ugh. BUT, this stew recipe can stand on its own, as-is. I gave it 5 stars because I was so impressed that such a small amount of seasoning could produce such flavorful results. The flavors of the spinach & sweet potato really shine, with the raisins as delicious little treats sprinkled throughout. We ate this over white rice, and it made a great winter meal :-)

My husband liked this. I liked it too, but for me, it was not one of those soups that you can keep in the fridge for long. The potatoes become too mushy, and the raisins plump up too much.

This recipe is DELICIOUS. I used 2 cups of boxed "non-chicken" chicken broth instead of the Campbell's condensed, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.

Made this last night and it was great! Not too labor intensive in terms of cutting veggies, etc., but still very fresh and tasty! The reviews said that it could be kind of bland, so I used all chicken stock (instead of adding 1/2 cup water). I also used a can of diced tomatoes (with juice and all) and one small fresh tomatoes, and I added salt and pepper for taste. It was great! And they are right, it does add a great fragrance throughout your house!

I think I may have overcooked the sweet potatoes a little, because they were definitely on the soft side, especially the leftovers. But the taste was there still. It was an interesting flavor, for sure, but it was good. Unique blend of ingredients. Would probably make it as a side dish in the future, as opposed to the main.

Very tasty and colorful!  My substitutions (just because I had them): I used a can of tomato sauce instead of the fresh tomato, a can of black beans instead of the chick peas, and red pepper flakes instead of crushed.  I added salt and pepper and an extra clove of garlic.  Totally not bland.

The flavors in this are wonderful!  I made it as stated but next time will at least double the broth, add another tomato or 2 and up the spices accordingly.  I simmered it for at least 30 mins to make sure the sweet potatoes were nice and tender.  Awesome over couscous or rice!

This stew fit perfectly with all of the produce I had that needed to be used, but I was a bit unsure at first because of the unusual combination of flavors.  Now that I've eaten it, I think it is absolutely delicious.  I halved the recipe but used an entire can of chicken broth and no water.  I also simmered much longer than stated.  This would be great with a bowl of white rice on the side for an "ethnic" potluck or dinner party.

to make it truly vegetarian, I too used all vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth/water combination.  The fragrance while cooking is delicious.  A perfect cold weather dinner over rice.

This was totally delish. A very fresh-tasting dish with a unique flavor profile - a good *savory* sweet potato dish. I doubled the red pepper flakes and the cinnamon - creative cooks could vary seasonings for even more interesting flavor. Served over couscous. I agree with other reviewers, it turns sad in the fridge (sorry, spinach!) but I ate the leftovers happily over the next few days.

Delicious!!! This is a favorite in our home. It has an amazing blend of taste and texture, and is very healthy. It's filling and has a nice amount of heat. I made the whole meal for about $4.00 so it's great for cooking on a budget.

This recipe was very very interesting. Seriously, almost perfect flavor. When you had the sweet potato, chickpea, tomato, onion and spinach altogether in one bite, my taste buds went nuts.

Recommendations:
1. use a bit more water, my rice was a little dry
2. Double the cinnamon and red pepper, I actually used paprika and cayenne, and it was the perfect level of spicyness
3. use a bit more tomato, it seemed like it needed that

But honestly, I am so glad I found this, so weirdly delicious.

This recipe was wonderful! It was easy to follow .I made a few changes. I used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth, and I used cherry tomatoes instead of roughly chopping  a large tomato. We had International Day at church, and this dish was a big hit.  I served with couscous. this is definitely a dish I will serve again, both for my family and for a crowd.

This is good but needs more cinnamon, as well as salt and black pepper.  Nutmeg is nice too.  It would be better with a fat, I think - peanuts? Peanut butter?

I really enjoyed this simple and hearty stew.  I added a single chicken breast to the recipe for more protein, as this was going a once dish meal.  My family enjoyed it as well.  I'll be making this one again.  Maybe switch up the greens? Kale, collards, mustard greens would all work.

Excellent and flavorful. Based on other reviews I added a bit more water but found all the other ingredients balanced well. I like spicy and I think if someone didn't care for heat it would be a bit much. I didn't think the 1/4" sliced sweet potatoes would cook thoroughly given the directions but they were perfect. I loved this and it will return!

I have made this recipe many, many times over the past year and it is always a super hit! Wonderful to throw together after work when I want something nourishing without alot of work or pots to clean up. I've always used a 14 oz can of petite diced tomatoes because I never seem to have fresh ones when I need them.  The cinnamon and red pepper are what make this.  Leftovers are wonderful for lunch next day when flavors have mellowed - my teenage daughter and I fight over who gets to take it as there's never much left.  Love it over quick cooking bulghur.

DELICIOUS! I wasn't sure what to expect with all these odd ingredients together, but this was really really good.  The cinnamon and raisins with the sweet potatoes sweeten it up.  And the red pepper flakes give it some nice spice! This is a keeper!!!

Nothing makes Hubby happier than coming home to the smell of onions frying -- he knows dinner isn't far behind and asks "is it West African stew?" --his favorite dish that starts with frying onions.  

I always hold off and add crushed fresh garlic when the onions are almost translucent since it's so easy to burn garlic.  I triple the amount of cinnamon and crushed red pepper, adding them while the onion cooks.  

We are Americans living in Thailand and this dish uses local ingredients.  Fresh tomatoes can sometimes be "iffy", so I use a local brand of canned tomatoes with great tomato sauce.  If I can't find sweet potatoes, I use cassava (which is more "authentic" West African anyway).  But, I steam the sliced cassava first until it's almost done with cinnamon and nutmeg because cassava takes longer to cook than sweet potatoes.

To keep this vegetarian, I use a chicken-flavored vegetarian bullion cube, don't drain the can of garbano beans and add water used to steam the cassava if the stew needs to be thinned.  

I add slices of fresh mango, if in season, just before serving.  

As mentioned by others, this recipe doesn't "keep well" -- the raisins swell and the potatoes/cassava get soft.  Fresh mangos really go soft quickly.  But, it doesn't matter, this recipe disappears within 24 hrs -- we quickly share it with friends, who are delighted.
