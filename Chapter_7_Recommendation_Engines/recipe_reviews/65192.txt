I needed something simple--this fit me well for both time and money. I cut this recipe in half. Because I don't use Miracle Whip, I substituted in Hellman's mayonnaise. Besides a few seasonings (onion powder, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, little hot sauce), I kept to the recipe. Out of the whole bowl, only one serving remains. My husband ate three helpings. My son did say that this would be perfect if you added in pickles--I think he's right. NOTE: From start to finish, this recipe took me less than a half hour to make.

This is exactly what my mother made during the 50's and to the present. Make sure your potatoes are fork tender, I boil them with the skins on and use brand name Miracle whip, regular yellow mustard, and sweet Vidalia - or dry minced onion and plenty of salt and pepper makes this taste good. Best when made the day before you plan to serve it so the flavors really meld together.

I LOVE this recipe.  I've been looking high and low for a perfect tater salad recipe and this one is absolutely perfect.  My family prefers dill potato salad, my husband prefers sweet salad.  I modified this for my husband and added sweet gherkins, 1/4 C sugar and some celery seed.  For my family, I added garlic salt and dill pickles.  Both batches were devoured.  This is an absolutely perfect base recipe.

This is good back lacking something, so I added al little bit of sweet pickle relish and paprika and tasted better. I also put a little chopped celery.

easy way to get some decent potato salad without cracking any eggs.
I added celery, relish and some minced garlic. Its plain otherwise.
Might want to half this one unless you want a gallon of potato salad.

I've made this recipe for years but with my own twist.  I add diced onion & celery and mix the Miracle Whip with Ranch Dressing.  Everyone loves this and its great for get-togethers!

I chose this recipe because it is very similar to the one my mom makes and everyone raves about. She just eyeballs the measurements of everything and I have a hard time with that. The only difference is I didn't use onion and I chopped dill pickles to go in it. I also russett instead of red potatoes. I'll try the red next time. It was so creamy. It was delicious! My hubby said it's the best potato salad he's had. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!

We had been invited to a cook out at a friends house and I was looking for a great potato salad to take with me.  As I live in North Arkansas, I saw this recipe and thought it would be perfect!  I added some garlic powder and paprika as suggested in other reviews and I used mayonnaise rather than miracle whip, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  It was very easy to make and didn't take too long.  I made it the day before as recommended by someone else, and it was delicious.  It was a hit at the cook out and my daughter has pleaded with me to make another batch.  It was lovely and creamy with a very nice flavor, not overpowering at all.  I will definitely be making this regularly, much to my daughter's delight....

I really enjoyed this potato salad, such a different flavor. I do love Miracle Whip, only with certain foods, never thought of potatoes though. Only change I made was to add an extra egg, otherwise made as written. This is a very nice change from the basic mayo based salad. It's sweet yet savory and is really nice. Thanks, I will use this again :)

This was a pretty good basic potato salad. As is, it's pretty bland...I added garlic powder and onion powder and it still was a bit short on flavor. However, would be easy to remedy. We enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

I've been making this recipe for years.  My husband wasn't fussy on the 'store bought' version so I looked at it and said hey, I can do that.  I add a grated carrot and 2 stalks of chopped celery to mine and peel my potatoes prior to boiling them.  I also use chopped green onions but have made it with a regular cooking onion as well when I didn't have any green ones on hand. I haven't tried adding the prepared mustard but will the next time I make it.

My husband loved this potato salad. When I first read the recipe he was spun over the miracle whip but once he tasted it, not only did he have 3 servings, he asked me to take it to a get together. I added 2 more eggs and paprika...so yummy.

I love this recipe and the only changes I make is adding 1-2 tbsps of apple cider vinegar. That adds that yummy zesty flavor my hubby and I love. I also add chopped celery sometimes which like the onions gives it that yummy crunchy texture. Super easy, usual have the ingredients always on hand and is a wonderful base recipe to add your own flare to!

This is the best potato salad recipe ever!! The only changes I made was instead of yellow mustard I used spicy brown mustard and used Hellmans mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip and a splash of pickle juice. This recipe is a keeper.Anne Collins

I was looking for a not too complicated recipe to throw together quickly, and this was it! Turned out great. I did make some adjustments according to the other reviews. First thing is I cut it down since there was only 4 of us. I did not need that much salad. I did add just a tablespoon or so of chopped dill pickle. And, instead of miracle whip I used mayonnaise and ranch dressing. (1/2 of each) I also did not have red potatoes, so I used russet. I made sure to cook them just to tender then took them off to cool in the water. When I took them off they were done. I peeled off the skins and cut into chunks. I added pepper to taste. Salt was not necessary with the ranch dressing and the pickles. I went easy on the mustard as my husband is not a big fan. This was a hit. My husband, daughter and father-in law each had seconds and then thirds. I could probably have used less mayo but it was creamy and seemed to add nice flavor. I will use this again.

This is how my mother taught me to make potato salad (minus the onion, I just use a little powder), and it wasn't until I was well into my adulthood I even knew there could be another way! To all those who substituted Hellman's for the Miracle Whip, well... you've made a completely different dish. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Hellman's, but to get the taste this potato salad promises it needs the Miracle Whip. To brandica8 and others who like pickles, I agree -- which is why I add a generous helping of dill pickle relish, much easier than all that chopping. You can also put in a couple more eggs, and there's no need to chop those either. I just put them in an egg slicer and then dump them right in the bowl. I have also used russet potatoes with no problem, but I peel AND cut them beforehand. They take much less time to boil when they're already in pieces, and then you don't have to handle hot potatoes. Everyone who grew up on a dill-style, egg-less, mayo potato salad just LOVES this as soon as they try it, and it is a favorite request at every barbeque I attend. I recommend you try this recipe as written as least once, and see if you don't love it too. Sorry for the LOOOONG review, but I really wanted to share this info!

recipe  is good.  I added one cucumber chopped and one finely chopped radish.  To the dressing I added one tsp. white vinegar and one tsp. white sugar.  this gives it more flavoring.  I omit salt all together as it makes it bitter.

This was the first time I made potato salad and it turned out perfect. I followed the recipe exactly except I used Hellman's instead of Miracle Whip. Everyone loved it. Although it took me much longer than what is stated to make this. It took a long time to peel and dice all those potatoes & eggs! But it turned out great.
