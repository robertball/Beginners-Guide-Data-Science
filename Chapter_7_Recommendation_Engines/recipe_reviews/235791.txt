I tried the recipe with both cheddar and mozzarella shredded cheese. My family loved it! It was so easy to make.

I followed the recipe as best I could. I'm a new cooker. I didn't know what magic baking powder was, so I just used the regular stuff from Kroger. Also, I couldn't find the double cheddar cheese, or what ever it's called, so I used Kraft extra sharp cheddar. I loved them. My wife didn't though. Albeit she's not a biscuit person. My mother, who is a southern Bell, loved them. They were fluffy, and Cheesy and  soft in the middle. Thanks for sharing this. I'll make them again for sure!

Delicious and very moist, but. . .I added 3tbsp. fresh parsley, 1/2 tsp. salt, &  3 onion dip mix (fromVictorian Epicure Inc.) that I often use. I used the pastry blade in the food processor for the entire process.  Diane

I used 2 c Bisquick, 1 pkg Neufchatel (crumbed with a fork), mixed in 1 c shredded cheddar, then 1/2 c (almond) milk.  Rather than roll it out, I just did drop biscuits.  Makes 24.  Served with butter.  Pretty tasty!

when making this I had no block cream cheese so I had to add 3/4 tub that is all I had, I did find that I had to put more milk in as it was so dry , added about 1/4 cup more,On the whole good but needs salt and herbs.Will Make again . oh the taste of the seasonings could be because I have a bad cold, the rest of the family gave it 5 stars so it must be really tasty
