Very nice blend of flavors.  I also added about 2 tbsp of the ginger pickling juice to make it more gingerly.

it was a bit mild for my taste but perhaps it's becos i used distilled white vinegar instead of rice vinegar and also omitted the mirin. I added 1/2 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1/2 cup of sugar and a sprinkling of sesame seeds as well..(inspired by  another recipe found in this website, "Hallejulah noodles"). The end result tasted uncannily like a raw fish salad ("Yu Sheng") that the Chinese people in Singapore have during the Lunar New Year...next time, i will add smoked salmon!

Fresh, quick and easy!  I used a Chardonnay instead of the mirin and added some wasabi to give it a kick.  It turned out great.

This was good but very sweet. I left out the peanuts, and the salad definitely seemed to be lacking, so next time I'll use cashews (I don't eat peanuts). I added half of a red pepper, and I crumbled nori over each serving, and that gave it more flavor and cut some of the sweetness. It was a very good accompaniment to sashimi. Bonus points for quickness and ease of preparation.

Wow!  It's just like my favorite mongolian resaurant "Kahn's".  So yummy and so easy.  I used the prechopped coleslaw mix, the prejulienned  carrots.  I made my own pickeled ginger using this recipe from the site Homemade Pickled Ginger (Gari). Didn't have Mirin so I used plum wine, and it awas delish!  Next time I will just speinkled the nuts on top to keep it even healthier.  I thought it would make too much, but my hubby and I split the whole batch and I wanted more!  Will Definitely make again!

This is that recipe that I make anytime I have to come up with something that is simple, elegant, and delicious. The only thing I've modified is that I chop the pickled ginger to make it flow on a fork easier.  The blend of flavors in this salad is what makes it my all-time favorite.

This salad is pretty good, if you follow the other reviewers' suggestions. I made it as-is, and found it quite bland. Then I added 1/4c olive oil, 1/4c soy sauce, and 1/4c sugar, and the result was much better. It tastes like those Asian-ramen noodle salads, just without the fat and sodium added by the ramen noodles!

I made as is, plus sprinkled generously Roland  brand Ginger Oil (found in the International section of some supermarkets) over the final product. This made it so much better, as it balanced out the rice wine/mirin/chardonnay(if u don't have mirin on hand). The nuts are a must.

I used red cabbage and was very pleased with how colorful this dish turned out. I recommend adding a sprinkling of lime/lemon juice to the dressing before tossing.

I have to agree with "iloveonions" I will have to try it again as she suggested. The recipe as is was not to my liking at all. I ended up just throwing a bunch of mayo in it and calling it gingered cole-slaw.

I keep forgetting the scallions, but finely chopped white onions works fine.  The combination of half green cabbage and half red cabbage is our favorite mixture, otherwise everything else remains as written. Oh, and by the way, we make the pickled ginger found on this web site and it's easy and delicious.
