I love salmon and am always looking for a new way to make it.  My daughter & I made this together. This came out awesome.  The salmon was very flavorful and the asparagus was done perfectly (not too hard or too soft).  Really nice presentation if you have company over!!

I loved the concept of this recipe.  I made the sauce as directed. Before putting it on the fish, I added more mayo because I found the dijon too overpowering.  I also increased the amount of tarragon and dill.  My salmon filets were 8 oz and I kept them in the oven for 20 minutes.  Because I needed to increase the cooking time, I steamed the asparagus separately from the salmon packets.  Wonderful.  I may just make it for Easter Dinner.  I am hosting this year and my brother in law is a chef!  This may be my chef worthy meal!

Excellent way to cook salmon (or any type of fish really) as it stays moist from being steamed in the parchment packet.  After reading reviews, I made 2 separate packets and cooked the fish in one and the asparagus in the other, totally divine and both were done to perfection.  The only thing I left out of in the ingredient list was the soy sauce as I do not keep any in the house (never use it, too much sodium), and I can not see the difference a 1/2 tsp would be in the overall recipe anyway.  Definitely a nice way to serve salmon, albiet with the mayo, one that shouldn't be served too often as the fat content is high...but a nice treat once in a while :) Thanks for the recipe Lizzie!

This recipe was one that I used for a dinner party a few months ago and it was a huge hit.  Everyone raved about how moist the salmon was and how tasty it was.  My husband later requested it as his birthday dinner, he liked it that much.      The first time I made it, I used regular mustard and a small amount of Tabasco for the hot sauce, but found it a bit vinegary.  I also, personally, found the asparagus to be a bit undercooked (as did several of the guests).  The second time around, I used Sriracha hot sauce and it was the perfect flavor for the mayo filling.  I also cooked the asparagus separately and wrapped the fillets in phyllo instead of parchment (I was out of paper and had the phyllo on hand).  That was a brilliant idea.  It worked much the same way as the parchment paper, but was edible and provided a nice crunchy texture to the salmon.  Definitely something I will do again.

This was very good.  I'm not normally a fan of fish, but the flavor of this dish was great.  I didn't quite understand why you'd cut the parchment into a heart first, so I just used it as a square that I rolled/folded into a packet.

Fresh herbs and asparagus made this salmon dish healthy and delicious. We used frozen salmon fillets with great results.

This was really good.  Altho I will not put asparagus in it next time.  It tasted fine but it went soggy.  The skin from the salmon also stuck to the asparagus, making it hard to eat.  I dont know if people usually eat the skin on fish but I definitly do not.  I also had to cook mine a little longer then stated.  I had to make my own pockets with parchment paper because I did not understand the "heart" technique.  Dispite all my complaints, I will be making this again, and again. Very good.  Thanks.

This turned out Fantastique! I Lived in France for a dozen years, so cooking in papillote (parchemin paper) was not new to me. I used to have a similar recipe, but lost it. This is as fine, if not  a better replacement I think I'll ever find. It was simple, and delicious. Everyone raved and were happy. Thank you.

This turned out well!  Only issue was the mayo, the taste of it seemed somewhat off with everything else.  Might try experimenting with a replacement.

Good dish. Would be five stars if the portion to sauce was more accurate. Even halving the sauce I had too much left over.

The salmon was so moist and juicy.  The asparagus was slighty crisp...just the way I like it and the sauce was very good.  Although I didn't use fresh herbs, it was still very good.

The fish turned out really nicely, but the asparagus was still too raw and the veggies turned the entire bottom of the parchment packet into a soggy wet mess. I'd say it was a mixed result with good flavors and a great method for cooking fish, but the veggies should be done separately.

Enjoyed.  Delicious.  Bake time needs to be longer than ten minutes.  Pan fry fish would be ten minutes, baking is longer.  Definitely use a thermometer and I cooked mine to 140f.  About 30 minutes in a Oster counter top convection oven at 400.

I used skinless salmon and put two lemon slices on top of the salmon after I salted and peppered each side.  I cooked it without the asparagus per other people's suggestions.  I baked it for about 16 minutes.  The mayonnaise sauce is the main reason I gave this recipe 5 stars.  It was awesome!!!

Pretty great.  Easy to make and fast.  It's even faster if you cook it in the microwave for about 4 minutes (my microwave is 1100 watts.  If your microwave is less powerful, you'll have to cook it for longer.  Greater than 1100 watts = less time).

Small Changes Made it Wonderful:  used sliced zucchini and scallions instead of the asparagus. Added a bit of brown sugar to the sauce. Served with zucchini and angel hair pasta.  The extra sauce inside the salmon was a perfect accompaniment to the pasta.  DH loved it -- said it tasted like something we'd order in a nice restaurant. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very good salmon dish...we enjoyed it a lot and we are not big 
salmon lovers.  My husband, the beefeater, said it was delicious.

This is one dish which brought out the flavors of tarragon and dill in a way that was delectable.  From my experiene, tarragon ruins the overall flavor but not in this case.  Also, the general taste of the dish was delectable!

This is a delicious and easy recipe that I will make again and again.  I followed it exactly and the only change I will make next time is to use a little less tarragon, but that's just a personal taste.  The fish came out beautifully - moist and flavorful.  The asparagus was delicious also.  And using the parchment was fun to do and made the presentation of this, frankly easy, meal really seem like something special and exciting.  Thanks so much for posting it!

Made this w/ fresh and frozen salmon and they both turned out great. I made couscous to go with which was delish! The couscous only takes 5 minutes to make so you can't go wrong.

I also made teeny potatoes (they look like fingerling potatoes but smaller), which I put in the oven first while I was prepping everything else. I drizzled the potatoes w/ olive oil, S&P, garlic powder, and onion powder on a baking dish - into the oven at 400F.
