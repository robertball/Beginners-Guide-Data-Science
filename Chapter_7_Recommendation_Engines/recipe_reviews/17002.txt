I made this so quick  Ididn't even add to recipe box right away.  I used this sauce over the memorial weekend and the chefs put it on the ribs,hamburgers, crab cakes,shrimp and chicken.  I was asked to bring it to the family's fourth of July picnic and and outdoor wedding. Thank the heavens I was able to add it and print it or I would have been exiled. THANK YOU THANK YOU for your recipe and web site

GREAT SAUCE ESPECIALLY ON RIBS, ADD ALITTLE HOT SAUCE TO GIVE IT AN EXTRA ZING.

Yummy!  I knew my fiance would not touch this if it was chunky at all, so I threw all the ingredients in the blender and whirred it up!  I added a little more soy sauce and garlic than called for.  Delicious!

Gosh this was good.  A nice change-up from the usual bottled BBQ sauce (although we like Sweet Baby Ray's so much I did use it as the base in this recipe).  Great marinade!

I was unsure about the mixture of barbeque sauce, salsa and soy, but it worked really well!  I cut back on the soy, but I should have used the whole thing.  I used mild salsa, but this would be great using hot sauce and honey barbeque sauce for a sweet/hot kick.  Will be using this sauce again! Thanks!
