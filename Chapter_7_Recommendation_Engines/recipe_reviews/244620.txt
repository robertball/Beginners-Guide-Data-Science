Cake was delicious! I frosted it with white frosting that I mixed about a tablespoon of coconut milk and a teaspoon of coconut extract and covered the entire cake in sweetened coconut flakes.

It was so light and moist. I brought in to my coworkers and it was all gone before lunchtime! Cake is a breakfast food, right??
