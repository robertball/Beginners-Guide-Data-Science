A simple and tasty sandwich. When I made it, I couldn't find any maple-glazed chicken, so I did use the optional red onion for a little more kick. I also mixed the mayo with Dijon mustard. Very good!

Always a great sandwich for lunch. Sometimes I don't use all the extras, just the meat bread and cheese and it's still good.

This was super yummy. I shared half a sandwich with my child, who inhaled it. I used Dave's Killer Bread, regular "deli" sliced turkey breast, just put the onion on my slice and I used reduced fat provolone, because that was all I had. I also added sprouts to mine. I used a lowfat olive oil mayonnaise and dijon mustard. This was quite filling with a cup of homemade soup.
