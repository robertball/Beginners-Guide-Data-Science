Really pretty, soft cookie with a just right taste of refreshing lime. The dough is very soft, so I chilled it until it became firm enough to work with. Made these for hubby's staff for St. Patrick's Day so I tinted the glaze green (made with powdered sugar and lime juice), and sprinkled them with green decorator sugar. They look as good as bakery cookies but taste SO much better!

These cookies are amazingly light and fluffy! I have not met any one who does not like them.

Be careful when cooking them, they do not change color much. Thankfully, I have not managed to overcook them yet.

For best results, let the glaze (lime juice and sugar) harden a little before storing the cookies. They stick together less, and the glaze is able to form a thin shell on top. One trick to apply the glaze is to dip the cookie into the glaze instead of dripping the glaze on the cookies.

A great cookie for when your in the mood for a nice light treat with a cup of tea. Not an overly sweet cookie so it really allows the lime flavour to shine. Served mine without the glaze to save on calories ;) Would recommend using icing sugar to make the glaze with because it will disolved better than the granulated sugar will and also wait until the cookies are almost completely cooled before you glaze.

I didn't have a fresh lime on hand so I used bottled lime juice plus the zest of an orange with a little fresh orange juice. The taste is still predominantly lime but has a nice orange background, especially when you bite into the zest. I was a bit hesitant about using granulated sugar so I just made an icing of powdered sugar and lime juice. YUMMY! VERY limey. will definately make again.

I made these cookies for St. Patrick's day. I made the glaze two different ways--one with powdered sugar and lime juice, the other with white sugar and lime juice(as the recipe states).  My family preferred using the white sugar glaze over the powdered sugar.  Fresh citrus cookie--yummy!

I made these to serve on Cinco de Mayo along with a Sangria beverage for a girls night and was begged for the recipe!! I even had to promise to take some into work for one of the girls that couldn't make it. I used key lime juice as that is my preference over reg..They are perfect for anytime of the year. YUM !!! YUM !!! YUM!!!

The cookies tasted pretty good, but the glaze never really set.  The cookies were almost soggy the second day.  Perhaps using a glaze made with powdered sugar and lime juice instead of granulated sugar may help.

These were tasty cookies. Definitely best served the same day as they are baked. I agree with the previous reviewer who thought they lost flavor the second day. Quite good overall.

A delightful little tea cookie perfect for a tea party. I heated the glaze to make a simple syrup before brushing on the cookies. Nice recipe, thanks.

Really great lime flavour, the only change I made was to use Splenda in place of the sugar in the cookie (I used 1/3 cup Splena in place of 3/4 cup sugar), I fin Splenda has an unpleasant 'metallic' after-taste if you use the same ratio as what the recipe calls for and since Splenda is sweeter than sugar, I always use about a 1/3 of what is called for in a recipe, aside from that, the cookies are good, the dough is soft and needed to be refrigerated for about 20 minutes to make it easier to handle, I rolled the dough into balls about 1 1/4" in diameter and then baked.  I used my convection feature in the oven (as I do with all my cookies) and this makes them take longer to be done, but you have to watch them or they do burn on the bottoms quickly.  I made a glaze from lime juice and powdered sugar and this really sets off the cookie. Definitely will keep this recipe on hand! Thanks for a nice change in a cookie recipe!

Freakin' stellar cookies! They're soft, cakelike, delicately citrus flavored and sweet. Portioned dough out with a tbsp measuring spoon onto a parchment-lined sheet, stuck them in the freezer for a minute to firm up, and rolled into perfect spheres. This gave me uniform, round cookies that didn't spread. Baking time specified was fine for me - cooked on top rack for 8.5 minutes. This depends heavily on how big your cookies are - if they are bigger, they will take longer. I used a little over 1/2 c of icing sugar, 2 tbsp juice and some zest for the glaze - and I STRONGLY recommend glazing. It was easy to paint on with a silicone brush, and it gave an otherwise plain cookie a sugary tang. (A microplane would have made finer zest.) I cannot WAIT to try these in a lemon poppyseed variation. Thank you for my new favorite cookie!

These were pretty good cookies-really something different than what you'd expect. The lime flavor was pretty mild in the cookie, but the glaze really tasted great. These were really soft as dough, so I ended up chilling them for a few hours. They came out very soft and cake-like, but quite tasty.

I took off a star because this needs way more lime juice in the batter.  I used the juice of 1 and 1/2 limes.  I used coconut milk because I don't like regular.   Mine needed about 1/2 cup more flour, and it was still a very soft dough. I should have added more.   I think you should chill this dough first.   I am eating one now!!  they are big and soft.   With the glaze, they are wonderful!!!  I followed the recipe with white sugar and lime juice.    I will make again for sure!!    I made these to go with some lime green tea :)   **Edited about a week or so later..    This time I added less milk and mostly lime juice.  I also added some nutmeg, per another reviewer and it highlights the lime nicely! I chilled the dough this time and it made it so much easier to roll attractive balls rather than gooey blobs.  These need longer than 10 minutes (for me)..  more like 15-20.   So delicious!  This time I also used half coconut oil and half butter cause I ran out of butter.  I think it made them softer!

These were so light and really tasty.  The glaze added that nice sweet/sour pop BUT like someone else posted it was super runny and never set and only made for soggy cookies.  :(  I was really bummed on that part.  What a mess.  Next time I will def bake them a bit longer so they aren't quite so so soft and try powdered sugar with the lime juice for the top.

I think these cookies were so-so. I followed the directions exactly and found them to be bland. However, I loved how thick and soft they are. With a little more lime flavor, they were perfect, but I also tried a thick, creamy frosting with them the second time I made them, and it made all the difference int he world.

These are great! Very soft and easy to make. Because some of the reviews said that these lose flavor after a day or so, I added lime zest to the glaze as well. I also made the glaze with confectioner's sugar instead of granulated, just because I had some on hand. I served these at a June baby shower, and the guests LOVED them. Their refreshing flavor was a hit, and there were none left at the end of the party :-)

Delicious, light, cake-like cookie that would be perfect for a special occasion.  We all enjoyed these.  I made a double batch which made about 62 cookies.  As soon as the glaze was hardened, I refrigerated half of the cookies with wax paper in between the layers...they stored well and tasted great later.  A plain cookie is very mildly flavored, so I added a tsp of lime zest to the doubled amt of glaze which turned out to be the right amount of zing.  I did add a little green food color to the dough and glaze just so they wouldn't look like a plain sugar cookie, and I also used powdered sugar in the glaze.  I will try this again with orange zest and undiluted orange juice concentrate in place of orange juice in the dough.  Very nice recipe for a dessert that is lightly sweet, not sickening sweet.

so good!  Fabulous lime flavor.  Although the cookies stayed soft, they seemed to have less flavor the second day, so in the future I will make sure they get eaten the day I make them.  Not too hard!

Great simple cookie.  I followed some other reviews and put the dough in the fridge for about an hour before I baked them.  They came out great.  This is one recipe I will make over and over.

A wonderfully sweet and tangy summertime dessert!  Very easy to make; the quick prep and bake time allowed me to complete a batch before the heat of the summer day kicked it.  I will definitely make these again!

Overall a fantastic base recipe for any citrus light cake-like cookies!  Go wild!  Lemon, orange, lime, and all the different types and extracts! I opted for a more wintery orange cookie.  I used a Cara Cara orange for the juice and rind.  Seemed like a mellowy orange flavor. My alterations, I reduced the sugar like always, this time to a 1/2 c, increased the zest to 1 T, increased the baking soda to 1/2 t, subbed 1/2 c wheat flour for a little texture, added 1/2 t salt. For the glaze, I increased the juice a tad, added 1 T zest to it as well.  I don't know if my glaze was more runny or not, but I prefered a looser glaze.  I used a spoon to apply the glaze, put about a teaspoon in the spoon, then slowly circled it around the top of the cookie, allowing the glaze to slightly slide off the spoon onto the top of the cookie, continually moving the spoon in a circular motion.  Be sure to let the cookies cool first before you put it on otherwise, depending on your glaze consistency, it will slide right off.  If you want your glaze to harden sooner, pop the cookies into the fridge for a few minutes right after you put the glaze on.  Otherwise allow them to harden slighly, naturally on the counter (unless your kitchen is really hot or your house it). Go forth and BAKE!

Oh my goodness what a nice treat! Not too sweet, not too tangy, and a wonderful soft texture. I only needed 1 lime. Delicious as they are with no icing.

Wish I could give this 5+ stars! Made recipe exactly as instructed, and I was surprised by the super-soft, airy texture of these citrusy delights. One suggestion: be sure to chill dough before baking! I was intially skeptical of the white-sugar dissolving in the lime juice, but it gels together in a nice sticky glaze. To prevent sticking together, I topped them off with powdered sugar. Next time I will probably add a wee bit more lime juice as I love extra tang. These are DEFINITELY keepers!

These are EXCELLENT!!! DO NOT CHANGE THIS RECIPE, with one exception. I love lime..however I love all citrus. Try substituting the lime ingredients with lemon or orange. My families favorites were orange...my hard to please dad, lemon. Me? All of them!! I also added just a tad more of zest as I love the color and texture it adds to the cookie. Thanks so much for this new easter favorite, everyone is getting their favorites in their basket.

Using the ingredients I had on hand, I used oranges as suggested by an earlier reviewer.  It is difficult to wait for the glaze before tucking into the cookies which have a cake-like texture.  Different from the cookies I usually make, I look forward to using limes next time.

I had to add at least an extra cup of flour, the dough was very sticky.  Also I sifted all the dry ingredients.  these cookies were very good and I will make them again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Super yummy cookies. I added 1T. zest  and 1/3 cup more of flour to the batter which made it a bit thicker so I could drop them immediately. I heated the glaze 20 seconds in the microwave and let it cool so it was easy to brush on the cooled cookies because the sugar was dissolved. I also added 1 1/2 tsp grated zest to the glaze. Perfection

These are INCREDIBLE!! I made them for my wedding (we're from Pittsburgh and we had an enormous cookie table), and they were some of the best cookies there.  I kept the batter in the fridge until I was ready to put it on the cookie sheets, and used a melon baller to scoop it out so I could have perfectly round cookies. I didn't use quite enough lime zest, so they weren't super lime-y, but they were perfect nonetheless.  You do have to keep an eye on them just to be sure that they don't brown too much.

The instructions for this recipe were perfect. Cookies turned out nicely. I was a little scared about dropping by spoonfulls because I had cratered mountains on the pan but they melted down into nicely shaped cookies. Unfortunately for me, the flavor wasn't great. I could taste the lime but for me, they could have used a little more sugar and even more lime flavor.

The perfect tea cookie:  lovely texture, not too sweet and so refreshing and light.  I wanted more citrus flavor so I used equal amounts of lime and lemon zest, lime and lemon juice and added a packet of unsweetend "True Lemon" water enhancer crystals to the dough.  I let the dough chill in the fridge for about an hour before dropping the batter with a tablespoon measure onto parchment-lined baking sheets.  They took exactly 14 minutes to bake to the perfect doneness, still holding their shape with slightest browning on the bottoms.  I didn't even need to let them rest on the sheet pans for 5 minutes before removing to cooling racks.  I wanted a thicker glaze, so I used confectioner's sugar, lime and lemon juice, and 1/4 tsp. lemon extract.  I dipped the tops of the completely-cooled cookies in the glaze, tipping them to let the excess drip off.  Garnished with a bit of additional lemon-lime zest.  This recipe is a keeper.  I can foresee myself making these often, and not just for my family.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

Light, cakey...refreshing! Not something I normally look for (I prefer a chewy, chocolatey cookie) but I wanted to use up a couple limes I had on hand. They are pretty and a perfect summery treat to share with coworkers. I had some toasted coconut leftover from a different recipe, so I added a sprinkling of it to some of the cookies. What a beauty! I love the extra texture and flavor... these won't last long!

Absolutely LOVED these cookies!  Six of us girls ate the whole batch in one sitting - they're that good :-)  The glaze almost makes them too sweet (I took a few other reviews recommendation to use powdered sugar instead of regular) but I have a huge sweet tooth - just be aware the glaze makes them really sweet.  Great recipe if you like lime!  Oh, I also added some lemon juice because I didn't have enough lime - so good!

If you have trouble with the glaze, just brush the glaze on the cookies 3-5 minutes before they are done in the oven. You will get a crunchy limony-sugary glaze over top. The cookies are delicious right out of the oven.

These are sweet, dainty little cookies with a sweet-tart lime glaze. I love the zest in the glaze. My sister and I made the cookies and everybody begged for more. I suggest a double batch. Put enough glazing on to cover the whole cookie, we couldn't get enough. I suggest making the cookie with a bigger circumference - - say, three inches or more. These "Monster" cookies can hold more glaze. (And, who doesn't want a big cookie?)

A little too sweet and soft for my taste, but they are a nice little treat with some strong tea. Very simple to make, and definitely the right treat for somebody who likes soft cookies. They do turn a little soggy due to the glazing though.

This is a great recipe BUT it doesn't specify salted or unsalted butter.  If you use salted butter, it's great, but if you bake with unsalted butter, you need to add 1/4 tsp of salt to the cookie batter to bring out all the flavor.   For the glaze I used 1 1/2 c powdered sugar, 1 tbsp softened cream cheese, and 3 tbsp lime juice.  Whisk till smooth.  Makes a wonderful glaze with a little substance, and it sets up really nice.  For a garnish, sprinkle a little toasted coconut on top of the freshly glazed cookies.

First let me say, these were really really good!  An excellent change of pace from the standard lemon cookie.  I skipped the glaze, and consequently wished I would have put more lime juice in the cookies.  So, if you are not going to glaze these, I would up the lime juice/and or zest, but thats just my opinion.  For sure, though, TRY THESE!  GREAT SPRING COOKIE!

These little cookies were delicious!  Made exactly as written, but found they took a little longer to bake.  Per other reviewers suggestion I used confectioner's sugar for the glaze.  A nice little treat, thanks Christina!

These were really good nice and light. Really fresh. I ran out of lime and lemon for the icing so I didn't use icing and my picky 5yr old still loved them. I did need to cook them about 3 minutes more than the recipe called for. I used key limes.

These are good cookies. For a smoother texture I substituted 1/2 cup flour with 1/2 cup corn starch. I also made the glaze with icing sugar instead.

These cookies were such a surprise hit that half were gone before they were cool enough to apply the glaze.  I made one batch lime and then other orange by substituting orange rind and juice accordingly.  Great light (and somewhat fragile) cookie.  I definitely will make these again!  thanks for the recipe.

Very good.  Light and delicious -- not too sweet, slightly spongy in the middle (kind of like light madeleines near the center), looks pretty.  I recommend using about a full teaspoon's worth of batter for each cookie.  Leaving the batter in the fridge for 15-30 minutes made it easier to spoon out.

My batch had some extra zest (a little under 3 tsp total), and it came out to be just about the right amount of lime flavor.  The icing is not necessary but good if you want more tartness from the lime and/or sweetness.

My daughter's church requests that the previous years confirmation canidates families provide cookies for the current years reception. So this year I was asked to bake three dozen cookie since my daughter was confirmed last year. So Even though I am not Catholic I cheerfuly started looking for recipies for cookies. I was determined to make something nice and interesting and that tasted like spring. I had Fresh Strawberries and Limes so with those ingredients in mind I went looking. Low and behold I found this! I read the reviews and I was impressed so I tried it and I was not dissapointed. the reception only got a dozen my daughter and I ate the rest and sent the others to the reception. I made more about a week later only the second time I doubled the lime the second time and it was even better and I also recommend heating the lime juice for the glaze before you add the sugar so it melts completely, making a simple syrup it sets up nicer and isn't gritty. I then sprinkled colored sugar on it which was very pretty!

These cookies are fantastic!!!  Nice and soft and lots of flavor.  I had to bake them for 12 minutes, however, which might be a fault in the recipe or an inaccuracy of my oven temperature.  I made these for hospitality at church, and I loved how people would bite into their first one, then take another to make sure they got a second before they were gone.  Definitely keeping this recipe in my "special" stash.

Followed recipe for cookie as is. Very cakey, light flavor - tasty! I added some more lime zest and a tablespoon of coconut oil into the glaze.

I baked these for my special Christmas tins to give out for special people. They were awful. No taste of lime, no zest, They were a dull plain sugar like cookie. Texture was okay. But everything else was blah. Lime extract might have been better. We all were very disappointed.

I made these for a tea party with friends, and they loved them!  People were actually raving about these cookies after the party, maybe because the lime flavor is so unique in cookies.  I would definitely make them again.  One tip: use powdered sugar for the glaze.

Hubby ate the whole batch in one day! He absolutely loved them and complained when I tried to put them away... will definitely be making this one again.
Also - the glaze MAKES the cookie, don't skip out on it! And as one reviewer suggested, dipping the cooled cookies in the glaze works beautifully.

These were really yummy.  I would call them Limonade cookies.  I made increasing the lime juice by a teaspoon for the batter and used powdered sugar for the icing.  Turned out awesome, except a little bit sticky to the touch, even after the glaze dried.  These are soft cookies, won't brown much so watch them and do yourself a great big favor and buy parchment paper to bake on.  They come off so easily.  I had leftover limes (you'll only need two) so I prepped for the next time by zesting the rest and storing them in a tiny tupperware in the freezer and freezing the juice in an ice cube tray so I can pop out just what I need.  Will make this recipe again and again!

These had so much potential, but just didn't turn out the way I had hoped. I expected the cake consistency, by the lime flavor is subtle...as in not really there. I also had an issue with the glaze making the cookies almost soggy. If I make these again, I will add more lime juice/zest, and will use powdered sugar for the glaze.

Cookies came out a little too soft, making it more like cakes than cookies. They were also messy to eat with because they're so sticky from the glaze. I thought the lime will really make the cookies shine but there wasn't much lime flavor to begin with. Will not make again.

These cookies were phenomenal!  Like many others, I also made the powdered sugar glaze to try on some of the cookies.  On the others, I used the glaze from the recipe.  Both were good.  It's all in preference.  My husband ate five of these as soon as I glazed them!  This will be a spring/summer tradition for my kids from now on!

I made these but instead of using lime I used lemon juice and they were really good!  They were definitely light and fluffy.  I like a strong lemon taste so I added a little more juice to the glaze but they are perfect, next time I will try the lime and see how I like them.

These were so very perfect for a summer day. They're very light and buttery and I loved the fluffy texture. Plus they were fairly simple. My only change: Def. use powdered sugar for the icing, that way it sets up and looks very pretty. Company loved these. Thanks!

I am not a fan of recipe reviews which change the recipe and I truly believe that this is a great recipe as is.  I did not use the glaze, which is where the disclaimer comes from.  Instead, I made a drizzle out of powdered sugar and lime juice.  We left some of the cookies without any topping, and they were still fantastic!!

These are the right cookies for cookies-and-milk! They're tasty, the lime flavor's there but doesn't knock you down, and 24 hrs later the texture is just as good as fresh out of the oven. I used the ingredients as written. I used my small (#100) "ice-cream" scoop to put the cookies on the sheets, and it made me 4 dozen 2-bite cookies. I set the cup of glaze down in very hot water and stirred it since the sugar wasn't dissolving completely, and it worked. You can be generous with brushing the glaze on - it makes a lot.  ...  These would be equally good using lemon zest and juice; and I think they'd also be good with no zest or juice using just water for the glaze, plus a couple drops peppermint flavor (to taste).

these cookies have a delightfully soft texture, and an excellent lime taste.  they taste so fresh and vivacious, especially with a cuppa sweet mint tea (i recommend mint papaya!).  also, since they are so low in sugar, my diabetic friends can eat them without having to worry too much about their sugar levels.

*if you don't like soft, cakey cookies, you probably won't like these.

First of all I made mine lemon as I didn't have any lime zest, but I cannot wait to make these little cookies with key lime juice and zest.  

They are light and fluffy. I simply dusted them with powdered sugar withing 5 mins of coming out of the oven.  I would like a little more lemon flavor to them so I will add more zest next time I make these.

Thanks for sharing.  I love these cookies.

These certainly aren't bad, but I wasn't wowed either. I probably will not make these again. For those who do make these, you should chill your dough. It is a tad on the soft side. I would also probably prefer a confectioner's sugar glaze rather than regular sugar.

absolutely delicious! these cookies are so soft and puffy, i like to sneak one before the whole batch has finished cooling. i'm a poor college student and don't have a zester or the skill to peel my own without getting some bitter pith too, so i made the cookies without the zest and just added some extra juice. i was worried they'd taste too bland but they're still limey; they taste more like a sweet candy-lime than a tangy fresh lime. one day i'll make them the right way and i bet they'll be even better. :)

i also made them with ener-g egg replacer instead of real egg because my boyfriend has food allergies. the cookies didn't hold their shape as well but when the taste is all that matters, it works just fine!

This cookie was more like a cake in consistency. There wasn't enough lime flavor in the cookie either. However, the glaze added to the flavor. I added lime zest and ONE small drop of green food coloring to the glaze.

Coconut lime modification :)
Was making these for someone who is allergic to milk.
Substituted coconut oil  (is white and solid at room temp)  for butter and almond milk for regular milk.  Only managed to get 1 tsp of lime rind off one large lime. Used 3 tsps of lime juice.   Did not make the glaze, felt they were sweet enough.  Did dust with powdered sugar but could skip that too. - BUT Hubby requested I add glaze :)
Love these cookies.  So delicately flavored!  Perfect.  Second time making them.  Will try using coconut milk instead of regular milk next time for a more lime/coconut flavour!
3/30/18  reducing the coconut oil makes the cookie more cake like - prefer the light airy crunchy wafer with full amount of oil.  Using full fat coconut milk does impart a more coconut flavor, albeit it's still pretty subtle.

This recipe was a hit and miss. I gotten a little worried when it requested to mix milk and lime juice, which can curdle the milk. It made the egg mixture a little unpleasant but it gotten better when I added dry ingredients. I had to slightly alter the recipe by adding a little more lime, salt, and some lemon to lift the lime flavor a bit. After I baked it and cooled, the cookie was more of a cake texture. It was spongey and somewhat a little too soft. I had to bake it almost 10 minutes longer because it could fall apart easily. It was a lot better when I baked it longer. Then when I sampled a bite, it had a very thin crunch then a soft center. It was pleasant but it was missing something. I topped it which two coats of lime glaze. I replaced sugar with icing sugar just to give it a better consistency. The glaze is pretty much the important part of the recipe, can't really do without it. I feel this cookie was more of a 'melt-in-your-mouth margarita cookie'.
 I don't think I would make this cookie again because it took more time out of my hands than listed and I had to alter the recipe to make it better. The cookie was a little too light like a cake, as I prefer it to be a little more dense like a real cookie.

The lime glaze on top provided the only flavor for a cookie that otherwise lacked any distinguishing flavor. It's more a texture than a taste -- super soft and fluffy and beautiful.

I made these cookies for  a family  gathering,  everyone really enjoyed them . The family said they were light and taste hard to just eat  one . The only thing I changed to the recipe was on the glaze , I added powdered sugar instead of white sugar.

My mom loved loved loved this recipe which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 3, but she thought there should be a stronger lime flavor.

I thought the cookie was average. There was probably too much butter (I followed the recipe exactly, except for when making the glaze). I can't point out an exact reason but these cookies weren't amazing, and lacked a distinctive lime flavor However, when I made the glaze I was sooo surprised how good it was. I started out following the recipe but ended up adding a lot more sugar (I used powdered sugar) until the color was almost opaque white. The lime flavor was still there though. The glaze really completed the cookie, so if you are looking to cut calories do it somewhere on the cookie, not on the glaze.

I don't have much experience with glaze so I wasn't sure if this one would harden but in the end it did, and I stacked them and wrapped them up for a bake sale. I think I would be okay to use granulated sugar instead of powdered since the sugar would dissolve anyways but I can't be sure since like I said I don't have much experience with glaze.

Light, pillow-like cookies that were more like muffin tops.  10 min cooking time was perfect...  Refrigerated dough for 30 min before baking.  Used the sugar glaze listed in the recipe.  Good way to use up leftover limes...

These cookies have the perfect "tea cookie" texture.  I did use two tablespoons of lime juice and decreased the milk to one fourth cup.  I added 1/4 teaspoon salt.  I made the glaze with powdered sugar and lime juice.  This is just a very tasty cookie.  I'm glad I tried this recipe and will surely make them again.  Thank you Christina Pierson for sharing your recipe.

These cookies are lovely! I was surprised to discover I had no all purpose flour, so I used whole wheat, and everyone loved them anyway! I gave them 4/5 since in the photo they seem perfectly formed, while in fact they turn out lumpy - my children were reluctant to try them because they looked like 'mini fish cakes'. I don't think this was a result of the whole wheat flour. They do have a wonderful texture and taste, and I can't wait to try them with the proper flour! Thanks for the recipe!

The cookie was very bland and not very stable. It said it would burst with lime flavor, but the flavor was very small and it only came from the glaze. The glaze tasted good, but never settled on the cookie and made the cookie slightly soggy. The only good part of this cookie was the flavor of the glaze, which was very good but the recipe didn't call for enough glaze so the cookies were very bland.

Really good cookies.  I did not have lime zest but that did not seem to matter.  Also, instead of the glaze, I made a light frosting with confectioners sugar and lime juice.  I like this cookie so much, I am going to try this recipe with lemon juice and orange juice instead of the lime juice.

These were absolutely delicious.  I was worried because the dough, and then the cooked tea cookies, didn't have a lot of lime flavor at first. It really needs the glaze to pull the whole cookie together.

These cookies came out great! I made them for a picnic with some friends that got rained out so I brought them into work the next day. They got rave reviews! One thing I noticed is that the glaze (used regular sugar) on top did not create as much of a hardened crust as I would have thought. Just made them slightly sticky ontop.

Excellent cookies! Soft, fluffy, and bursting with fresh lime flavor! These were easy to put together. The dough was soft and slightly sticky but dropped them by rounded spoonsful onto an ungreased baking sheet. They form a nice circular shape while baking up-all in 8 minutes. They are very pretty and I could see the fresh zested lime specks throughout the cookies. I used the sugar and lime glaze to brush over the cookies when they were cooled. I also added a neon green tint color to make it pop a little more. They tastes so fresh and light. I love the buttery flavors as well. The ingredients, measurements, baking time and servings were spot on! I had 24 delicious perfect tea cookies.

Nice light texture; good for after a heavy meal.  Note this only makes about 30 cookies, so double it if you need more.  I removed the cookies from the baking sheet after about 2 minutes; when I waited 5 minutes, they stuck.  Be careful when removing them or they will tear.  For the glaze I used confectioner's sugar with the lime juice and added lime zest for more tang.  The cookies by themselves don't have as much of a lime taste as I expected, but with the zesty glaze they were perfect.

Super yummy!! I tasted the cookies without the icing and they are super yummy. I'm thinking of not making the icing because they are so gosh darn delicious!! Will make this recipe over & over & over. Can't wait to try this with some orange zest as one reviewer mentioned. Make these - you will LOVE them!!

I don't even use lime zest, just lime juice.  I have used orange zest before and that was also great.  They cookies are perfect, soft and cakey and refreshingly lime-y.

I made these cookies since I had extra limes left over from a party. I didn't have all-purpose flour, but used wheat flour and added 1 tsp. of vanilla. In order to have that stronger lime taste, I brushed the lime sauce 3 times and then when it dried, I sprinkled powdered sugar to give it some color. It was a cake like texture. But overall most of the people at my husband's work liked them.

These cookies did NOT turn out like cookies.. they were more like a cookie texture on top but bread otherwise.. They were more like flattened bisquits! Although, they had a good taste. I used Lemon Extract, because I had no Lime.

Very pleased with these cookies.  Because my oven cooks cool and I'm always nervous with "ungreased cookie sheets" I cooked mine for 10-12 minutes using a rubber mat on the cookie sheet.  They turned out great!  Also, as with most butter-cookies, remember to put small spoonfuls on the sheet.  Too big and they spread quite far.  Thanks for a light yummy cookie!

Oh my goodness were these delicious! I made them for Easter weekend for a house full of chocoholics, and they didn't last long at all! Even the kids liked them. ^_^ I did have a few mishaps while making them, but they still turned out delicious, proving that this is a forgiving recipe. I didn't have AP flour, so I had to substitute self-rising and omit the baking powder and soda. Instead of the white sugar for the glaze, I used powered sugar. I thought it came out fine, but I'll probably try the white next time. One of the reviews mentioned that these didn't change color while baking, and they were right! Keep an eye on them!  I highly recommend this recipe.

Made these this afternoon - delicious! The only change I made was to the glaze. I took the lime juice I had remaining after juicing 2 limes for the recipe and added powdered sugar to it until the right consistency (about 2 cups-ish). Yum!

Made these tonight, very easy to do, and super tasty WITH the glaze/icing.  I made the icing with powdered sugar and it was great.  If you make these for a group, plan to double or triple the recipe, as a single recipe doesn't make a lot.  Definitely will make again!

I'm giving this five stars because it won me first place in a cookie exchange.  I made it as specified, except I substituted powdered sugar for the granulated in the icing.  Contrary to other reviews, I would actually reccomend making these a day ahead.  When I first made these, they tasted very flour-y.  I wouldn't have brought them to the exchange if it weren't very late at night when I finished making them, with no time to make something else.  However, they were quite good the next day.  Also, it took me a LOT longer than 20 minutes to make, mostly due to the time it took to zest the limes.

I really love how light and fluffy these turned out. I think they're best with the glaze, it gives the cookies a nice kick. Without the glaze it's more subtle, gentle, in flavor though. Which is nice too.

My cookies didn't look like the picture at all. They weren't round, they weren't fluffy, they ran all over the plate like a puddle and sort of cooked together, and as a final insult, they didn't want to let go of the pan. The little bits I managed to hack off tasted great, but the rest just stuck to the pan, staring at me. For a more patient cook, this must have been lovely.

This cookies are easy to make and delicious! I used yogurt since I didn't have milk. I reduce the sugar at 2/3 of a cup. Because I made a thicker glaze with 1/2 a cup of sugar powder and about 3 tbsp of lime juice.

SO GOOD! As I write Im eating one of these light and fluffy cookies. I made the recipe exactly as stated and wow, the only thing I did not enjoy was the glaze. Thanks to my hubby, he said maybe I shhould only glaze a few and see how they taste, they were a hit! I will be making these again and soon, in a triple batch!

Decent, but not exactly my cup of tea (no pun intended). Though I like soft cookies, these were virtually falling apart. I had made a double batch, so I baked the first 2 trays as directed, but on the rest I baked longer by 3 to 4 minutes. They were more sturdy, and still maintained the softness. Good flavor though. Mixed some lime with cream cheese and powder sugar to ice some.

Very nice texture and delicate flavor, I'll make these again. Be sure to space well on the cookie sheet, as they double in size. I also melted chocolate chips in a double boiler and added about 1 tablespoon of lime zest to it. I half dipped the cookies in this, it turned out very nicely.

Good cookie recipe, but I preferred it after I changed it a little. I omitted the glaze. Increased the lime juice to about half a shot glass of fresh strained lime juice. When the cookies were baked, I sifted a little powdered sugar on top. My family was pleased with the softness of these cookies.

It tasted better with the lime sugar glaze. I added lime peels in the sugar glaze for emphasizing the flavor. The texture of the cookie was interesting. It was very soft and moist almost like a cake.

These cookies are amazing! I did not have white sugar so I used raw sugar instead and they came out fine. Next time I am going to see if they come out good using unbleached or whole wheat flour.

Yummy and a little different.  I used lots of lime zest in the batter.  I also made the glaze using powdered sugar, lime juice and corn syrup for shine.  I dipped the cookies in this.  Will make again!

So, so good!! The texture is light and delicate and the buttery flavour is not overpowering. I use this recipe as a base and add other flavours in the same manner (ie. coffee, lemon, chocolate).  Thanks for posting!

Very light and fluffy but I found them too light on taste.  I think next time I make them I will add at least 1 extra tsp. of lime zest.

Yum! My husband said these are addictive.  He loves citrus flavors.  I know I will be asked quite often to make these.  The reason for 4 stars and not 5 are I had to double the lime peel(and may add more next time) and a little more lime juice.  Next time I will try what another reviewer suggested and use powdered sugar glaze, but I haven't done this as of yet.  These are wonderful cookies.  Thanks for sharing.  I'll surely think of these come Spring every year.

This cookie is AMAZING . I decided to make them lemon instead of lime today and rather than brushing on the glaze i made it a touch thicker and dipped the tops of the cookies in it , and then sprinkled the tops with yellow coarse sugar .

These cookies are light and fluffy, almost like a tiny little cake.  I plan on trying them with Grapefruit, Lime, and orange, but the lemon is irresistable! ( I made them at 2pm and by 5 pm they are GONE)
LOVEE these!

A nice, light and tasty cookie. These are perfect for Spring time. I have made these several times now and I'm sure I'll make them again and again.

the taste was great but my batter was a little runny. i refridgerated the dough and the cookies held their shape.  i used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar for the glaze.  my kids loved them.

The cookies tasted great, but they didn't hold their shape well.  The first half of the batch came out ok, but with the second half of the cookies, the dough seemed a little runny (maybe it should have been chilled).  Other than that, they tasted great.

Very tasty, light, and fluffy.  The cookie itself tastes like a sugar cookie (but not quite as sweet) with maybe a hint of lime.  The glaze is what gives it the extra zing that I liked.  Almost too fluffy in that it crumbles easily.  The basic recipe is good, but I would prefer the cookie crisper, and will try to modify it some next time to do so.

Very delicious.  Not too sweet and just enough sour.  I made these for a church meeting and everyone enjoyed them immensely.  I added a tiny bit of green and yellow food coloring to the glaze to make it look very "limey" and it was a nice touch.

I made these for one of the dessert nights that I hosted and the ladies gave these rave reviews.  I was a little skeptical since you add granulated sugar (and not powdered) to the juice, however they really like it.

So so so good! I made this for my birthday, and I tripled the recipe and ate dozens of it! My suggestion is, instead of using lime zest, use orange zest. Its much more sweeter and savory. The lime zest makes it sour.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! Our family’s favorite cookie since the first batch I made.  Always chill the dough. We do substitute powdered sugar for granulated sugar with the glaze.  It sets on the cookie better. I recommend making a double batch every time cause they won’t last long.

I wish the expected number of cookies were included in this recipe,  also, I made more than the mentioned amount of glaze, stepping up to 1 cup of sugar, (I used confectioners sugar with the recipe did not specify) and as much lime juice as needed to make it work.  I also added some lime zest to the glaze.  Easy recipe, great cookies.

I thought they were great! They aren't very sweet, but that's what I liked about them. I did make an icing out of powdered sugar and lime juice as suggested by other reviewers.

I did not get that WOW lime , despite using juice from 2 fresh limes and their zest. Also not very sweet, and too soft. It was difficult to judge doneness as they really don’t brown except bottoms, which you can’t see.

Mine needed more time in oven - probably 15 mins - and stuck badly to the pan. Hadn't read enough reviews and may try again, refrigerating dough beforehand and trying parchment lined pan. I made glaze with powdered sugar and it definitely helped flavor. Don't know how they'd hold up overnight however. These are definitely more cake than cookie like. A guest added fresh blueberry jam on top and that was a winning combination! Flavor of these is nice but do think they're a bit doughy.

I made a couple adjustments. Added 2 tsp rose water along with the lime juice. I had some organic dried rose petals on hand so I added some to the cookie dough. Put more crumbled rose petals, and lime zest, into the glaze. It made them look quite festive!

Followed the recipe to a T and they came out terrible.  The very first time ever making a cookie and they were like soup.  Very disappointed since I wanted to make these for someone who like lime.  Didn't even bother with a glaze.  And I even put in a little extra flour since I thought it was too soft.  Maybe should have added a lot more.  Not making these again.

I made these cookies twice, first as written, and then with changes.  My rating is based upon the recipe as written. I found several issues - the lime flavor in the dough was not strong enough for our liking,  the dough was too sticky even after chilling, the white sugar (vs confectioners sugar) glaze soaked the cookie, etc. Then I made the recipe with several changes - adding more zest to the batter, adding more flour to the batter, chilling the dough and then rolling the cookie balls in white sugar, chilling on the baking sheets before baking, using confectioners sugar in the glaze. I love lime and think that the idea of a sugar cookie with lime is a great idea, but these cookies fell a bit short for me.

I followed this recipe exactly as is, and these cookies turned out beautifully!!  They were a hit at my daughter's birthday party, and they were light and delicious!

For the glaze,  I used the granulated sugar, and it turned out nicely - just right.  I really did not feel like "brushing" on the glaze, so I just took each cookie and dipped it upside into the glaze.  Perfect! :)

I just made this recipe today- turned out great :)  really fast and tasty . I used lemon zest and juice instead of lime-and the cookies turned out really nice and fluffy-light inside .  The dough as one of the reviewer mentioned is hard to work with -it is quite sticky...so a bit challenging to make nice shaped cookies- will try next time to cool the dough a bit and see if any easier to manage -as i would like to have a nicer -round shaped cookies :)  will post photos shortly ... this is a keeper recipe .  I also like to add - that the glaze on the recipe picture is definately not with white sure but powder sugar!  It is not right to post a photo with a recipe that is not going to look like that -when following this recipe!  also not sure how it is so perfectly round-make it twice now and it is no way that you can make a perfect round cookie from this recipe -dough .... the photo on this recipe is very very deceiving - even though the taste of the cookie is great -it will not look like the picture !

This is a very good cookie to have with afternoon tea! I found they were a little bit dense and also cakes but they were so good. Next time I may add a bit more lime because I found the taste was too mild, but everyone else thought they were fantastic. Cooked for 9 minutes in my oven.

Soft and delicious. I halved the recipe because there are only two of us and others mentioned that these don't keep very well. I don't think they're going to last long enough for me to find out whether that's true!

These were quite good. I used lemon instead of lime as that's what I had and failed to add the lemon zest to the cookie. I thought it was for the icing, my fault for not reading the recipe clearly. So I did add the zest to the icing as I thought the cookie would need more flavour due to my previous error. End result was simply delicious so no worries. Very easy recipe to make, even for dunderheads like me.

Cake like cookie.  The glaze is tasty but leaves the cookie sticky. Used wax paper between the layers

Light and delicious! Perfect for tea or coffee! The only change I made was to use confectionary sugar for the lime glaze.

It was probably my fault they didn't turn out right, but they kinda turned into one massive cookie.  I didn't follow the directions perfectly...

These were cakey yet almost melted in your mouth.  I loved the way the glaze gave you a mouthful of flavor.  It's not often that something so good is so easy... the hardest part is zesting the lime.

Loved the fresh key lime flavor. Added some extra zest to light confectioners sugar/milk icing. Easy and a very refreshing light cookie.

Followed recipe to a "T" and almost threw out but had no time to bake something else.  Problem with crumbly, cake texture, anemic looks, poor release from cookie sheet, and not that great of taste.  Decided to take time to submit this review ( I hardly ever review recipes or products).  Perplexed at 5 star ratings. Bakers beware!

Loved these! I enjoyed lemonade cookies when I was growing up... these reminded me very much of those, but I like that these are made "clean" with fresh limes. I made the recipe as written except that I used coconut oil instead of butter to make it dairy-free. That coconut flavor paired nicely with the lime. I will definitely make these again.

I followed the recipe for the cookies, but used confectioners sugar for the glaze. These were very light, but had a very cake like texture and softness. I think I prefer a firmer cookie so I might add more flour if I made these again. Nice flavor but I would also think about adding a lime extract or oil to the batter to intensify the flavor, they were a tad bland.

I followed this recipe exactly,except I lightly greased the pan because I was  afraid they would burn to the pan.I started by cooking then for nine minutes,I took them out and they were still incredibly soft and not even slightly golden brown on the edges.So I put them back in the oven,after about thirty-five minutes I thought they were done.I took them out and let them sit for five minutes.When I checked on them the outside was only slightly cooked and the inside was still doughy. The next day the lime flavor wasn't really there anymore,they just tasted like bad sugar cookies. I don't know what went wrong,I can see that a lot of people have had very good success using this recipe.

These cookies are AMAZINGLY!! They are soft and the lime isn't too powerful. I've made two batches now. I added some powdered sugar to the icing recipe, like the reviews suggested, because it was very soupy and helped thicken it. I also dipped the cookies into the icing like others suggested and it worked out beautifully. I received many compliments on these cookies.

I just made these cookies earlier today and I followed the directions as listed.  I loved the flavor of the cookies and they turned out very soft.  At the end of the 10 minutes of baking, I had to bake for an extra 5-7 minutes because cookies did not brown around the edges.  Also, the glaze was so runny, the cookie basically absorbed it.  Overall, the cookie had tasted great!

Very good but a little too soft and crumbly! As a disclaimer I added a bit more lime juice to the dough and I eyeballed the ingredients for the icing to my taste and used powder sugar. I left them out overnight and the icing seemed to set ok but I live in a dry climate and that may have helped. Next time I will add a bit more zest to the dough and use a full 2 cups of flour.

They definitely weren't as lime-ey as I predicted them to be. The cookies just tasted like butter cookies, which were fine, but they weren't lime cookies. I don't know, maybe I didn't put enough lime zest...? :) and the "glaze" was awkward. It was the consistency of a dry-ish lip scrub, and I don't think it was supposed to be like that. Anyway, the cookie was alright...

Made these cookies and we enjoyed them very much.    I did not change anything.   They're great just as per recipe.   Will be making again.  Thanks. I am always looking for new cookie recipes.

Totally awesome soft cookies.  I was making a heavy, spicy meal and just wanted a light bite of something fresh for dessert.  I stumbled over these cookies and decided to give them a try.  I read earlier reviews and used half milk/half whipping cream.  I used two TABLESPOONS of lime juice in the batter.  On a whim, to add some texture, I added a half cup finely chopped, toasted pecans.  I chilled the dough before dropping teaspoonfuls onto parchment papered cookie sheets.  A 10 minute cook time was perfect.  I added 1 tablespoon of cream cheese to the lime juice and powdered sugar glaze to give it some body.  The taste was great but the consistency was just too thin.  Next time I am going to try using a light lime flavored icing.  These were still a hit for a fresh, light dessert.

I couldn't get any limes, so I used lemons and they turned out great!
The lemon syrup/glaze made it even better!!!

The cookies came out ok, but there wasn't very much citrus zing or strong flavor to them.  I would enjoy more zip in them.  Perhaps next time I will add more zest to the dough.

These cookies were good however, they are not crisp cookies. They are musch more cake-like. The icing should not be omitted. It has the most flavor and finishes off the cookie nicely. I will make these again.

These were so good I wish I could've given them 6 stars. The only thing I added was 2 drops of green food coloring. They are definitely going in my recipe box!

These are nice, but nothing special. I made them and my guests said that they liked them, but didn't have seconds. I found them to be more cakey in texture and therefore wasn't too fond of them. I like more of a crunchy chewy cookie. Anyhow, the taste was nice, but the texture was very unsatisfying for me as a cookie.

These are the perfect sweet/tart combination.  I followed the recipe except used powdered sugar in the icing to make it creamer and stand out on top of the cookie a little more.  Nice creamy batter, baked up nice and round.  The lime is not overpowering, but just gives it a little more flavor than a plain sugar cookie.  Will definitely use this recipe a lot, especially when limes go on sale.

Wow. Amazingly yummy! I substituted 1/4 cp Alouette for the 1/3 cp milk to give a smoother consistency. I think sour cream would do the same trick. I also didn't have an egg, but had egg whites. I used 1/4 cp egg whites and 1 tsp oil. Also instead of white sugar I made the glaze with powdered sugar, 1 Tbl of light corn syrup, and added lime juice until I got the consistency I wanted (approx 3 Tbl). I love this recipe!!

Awesome cookies!!! Best way to use up limes. Super easy to make. I did discover, however, that if you are using a baking stone.... it takes twice as long to cook! Yummy!!!!

Thank you- thank you- thank you!!!!  I've been looking for these cookies for years!  My grandma use to make these for me when I was a child and I remember eating these by the handfull with a glass of lemonade!  They are just the same!  PERFECT!  Thank you so much for posting this one!  Whole family is eating them right out of the oven!  I'd give more stars if the sit would allow me!  10 stars!

Nice and spongey! I had limited ingredients and used the same substitutes as Emily DB (orange zest, and powdered sugar in the glaze). The results were a little sticky, but good.

Needs the glaze for sure. I used the zest from the entire lime & I still don't think it is enough. My husband thought these were a 4, but agreed they needed the glaze (tried some without also). Don't know for sure if I'll make again because I want more lime taste.  They do "stick" to the inside of your mouth.

Good recipe. My oven is very slow so I ended up baking the first batch for 18 minutes to get results like the picture. I found the first batch too soft and cake-like for my liking. I ended up baking the rest for  25-30 minutes and was happy with that consistency. The glaze was fantastic.

These are delicious! I didn't change a thing. I love the taste of lime and these came out great. I made them a little big not realizing how much they would spread out on the pan, so next time I'll try making them a little smaller.

These are absolutely wonderful.  I added a little extra lime juice to the cookie and I used powdered sugar for the frosting.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and they are so delicious.  I can't wait to share them at work.  I know they are going to be well received.

I've made this a few times and it's always turned out delicious.  It also keeps well.  Very cakey, but that actually compliments the taste well.  I added about a teaspoon of ginger and upped the lime zest slightly.  One of the times it looked a bit dry so I added about half another egg and it turned out fine.

These didn't have much flavor. The recipe is very similar to the buttermilk cookies from epicurious (more butter and flour), but that recipe produced much tender and flavorful cookies. These were OK, but I won't make them again.

My cookies came out nicely brown on the outside but way too soft on the inside. More like a crumbly mini cake than a cookie. Also, the lime zest was a bit overpowering, made the taste too bitter. And there wasn't enough lime taste! In fact, you could only smell the lime but not actually taste it. Not a recipe I'll be a trying again.

I wasn't very impressed with these. I gave some to several friends, and none of them called me to rave how delicious they were (like they usually do when I give them homemade yummies). They were ok, but not special in any way. I won't make them again.

These cookies are excellent.  Soft and cake-like.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were great.  Would love to try them with a lime frosting on top rather than the sugar/lime glaze, but the glaze was great too!  Will be making these again!

My neighbor gave me a bunch of limes off of her tree. I was looking for a great recipe to use them.  This is way more than I hoped for!  I used splenda for the cookie recipe and real sugar for the glaze. This is a definite keeper!  Thank you for sharing.

Delightfull fluffy cookies. My only complaint would be that the glaze that goes on top is a little sticky and causes the tops of the cookies to become slightly mushy. I made 36 cookies and still had to bake them more around 12 minutes to get that nice golden crust on the bottom.

So good!  I read the other reviews and decided to go with confectioner's sugar for the glaze and it worked out great.  I also increased the amounts for the glaze.  I used shortening because I happened to be out of butter, but it didn't seem to make a difference.  I also baked them on a parchment lined baking sheet for eight minutes (though the second batch didn't look quite done after eight, so I left them in for another minute).  These cookies were delicious and everyone who tried one agrees!

Light and tasty. I used granulated sugar for the glaze and thought it was fine.

Delicious tender cookie. Perfect for a wedding cookie. (I have to make 24 dozen). And the lime also matches the brides color scheme! Thanks for sharing! Yummy! I make a powdered sugar lime glaze and grated fresh lime zest on top. Extra flavor and visual appeal!

These were quite good.  Making them smaller (1t) & baking on parchment paper helped.  Definately more of a cake like cookie, not a 'melt-in-your-mouth' butter cookie--but, still good.  Perfect for a tea...but, my kids & hubby actually loved them too.

JUST made these and..mehh. They're like a mellow sugar cookie, not exactly bursting with flavor for me. Not sure why that is..Thanks tho!! ADD:: Went to the grocery store the other day and as we pass the limes she says, "I don't think you should make lime cookies again". At least they got eaten!! I agreed, not again

Very good! Also, we shook ours in powdered sugar instead of the glaze. Next time if I skip the glaze, I will add more lime to the dough.

these came out really tasty! I followed one of the previous reviewers and made the glaze with confectioner's sugar & lime juice. I also used key limes for the zest and that made them really good.

I just finished my "test" batch and these get an A++! Plan to serve these with a mix of fresh fruit to finish off lunch at our church's womens meeting. I did follow the advice of others and use icing sugar to make the glaze, and added just a drop of green coloring. These are SO refreshing!!! Can't wait to see how they go with my favorite blackberry tea!

This is a great recipe!!! I did not have lime but I did have a sweet grapefruit on hand.  It worked perfectly.  Thank you.  I did take the advise from one of the other reviews and let it cook for 2-3 minutes than the recipe required.  Lovely recipe, thank you.

What a delightful little treat! The texture resembles cake. I tripled the amount of lime in the batter because I love citrus. I piped the batter onto the pan using a pastry bag and a large star tip. Cons: the cookies spread out during baking, and they lost their pretty shape. Pros: it was less messy, and the cookies were uniformly shaped. Line the pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking. I microwaved the glaze for one minute to melt the sugar, then brushed it onto the cookies with a silicone pastry brush. The glaze makes this cookie special!

Not bad, but the cookies themselves had very little lime flavor.  I added about 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the cookie dough because it was a little thin and then used powdered sugar instead of white sugar for the glaze.  Very good when glazed!!

Love this recipe.

Easy to make. Pretty much followed the recipe, but I added more lime juice [based on other comments] and had to use orange zest instead of lime.

Really tasty--they went so quickly that this time I have to double the batch.

I personally add a tiny bit more lemon zest, and substitute about a table spoon more of the milk for lime juice. It makes the flavor stronger, for when you have them with out tea. Other wise, these are perfect for tea.

Delicious!  I am a huge fan of lime anything, and these really hit the spot.  The only change I made to the recipe was that the sugar in the cookies themselves (not the glaze), I replaced with 1-1/2 tablespoons stevia powder, which took out the sugar calories without adding toxic synthetic sweeteners, though didn't taste any less sweet or delicious!  I enjoy them as a low-sugar sweet kick to cut the craving! :)

Absolutely perfect.
I'm a little on the crazy side, so just for fun, I subbed out half the milk for Malibu rum, and in the icing I did half lime/Malibu instead.
Don't overbake cookie. 8-10 is perfect, and you will love this! Perfectly light and fluffy.

These cookies are some of the best I've ever made. Soft, moist, and very limey. They had a unique flavor and were a hit with everyone in my family. I used key limes instead of regular and added extra zest and the flavor was absolutely delicious.
It is worth it to make the glaze.  It adds an extra something special. Let the glaze harden and the cookies won't stick together.

I love these cookies! I usually try to watch my weight but I just couldn't help eating one cookie after the other. They're soft on the inside and crispy at the ends. Also, I didn't make the glaze because I thought they were perfect on their own. They're basically sugar cookies with a great lime flavor.

I veganized this by using a nondairy margarine and replaced the egg with 2T H20 + 1T oil + 2tsp baking powder . I also added shredded coconut to the batter. For the glaze, I heated it up in the microwave for about 2 seconds and added some arrowroot powder to thicken it up. Then I added some more shredded coconut on top. I gave them to my mom for Mother's Day and she loved them! I sampled a few and thought they were absolutely amazing as well. I'll definitely be making these again.

these were very easy to make and tasted good too, my family ate them before I had time to make the glaze I imagine they would even better with the glaze I added a touch of green food coloring to give the cookies a "minty" color

These are awesome cookies!  I didn't change a thing.  They have a wonderful citrus flavor, and are very refreshing.  Definitely a keeper.

These were soggy and dough-ey tasting. They didn't seem to want to come off the cookie sheet either, so I was left with a  crumbly mess of soggy cookies.

Very cakelike and a bit too fragile; would prefer something with more crisp, but the flavor was wonderful.

Very yummy! I did half lemon and half lime in place of all lime. I think it would be better to grease the cookie sheet, though. The cookies stuck a little bit and left little crumby round circles when I took them off.

These were okay, but I am not a huge lime fan , so I probably won't make them again.

I really liked these cookies!  However, be forewarned, if you do not like a lime flavor, these probably aren't the cookies for you.  If you do like just a *hint* of lime, leave off the icing.  These cookies are perfect for a party -- people are taken aback by their taste!
