you forgot one thing, after the shaping , and before the baking , your unbaked pretzels must be poached in baking soda water to get the that pretzel shell and taste

I found the recipe to be very easy and very good, although the prep time was at least 1 hour not the 15 minutes the recipe said.

For a basic, easy recipe this one is really good! The texture turned out excellent even though I just used all purpose flour (not bread flour). Would be a great pretzel/bread stick recipe to do with kids as it doesn't have any extra steps (like boiling before baking) and yields a yummy result. Good dipped in salsa...mmm...

Excellent recipe! However, we found that by only making 6 pretzels they were much bigger and kids seemed to like that better. NOTE: If you are having a hard time finding Kosher salt, go to the liquor department and get a container of margarita salt. It works just perfect as a substitute for the kosher salt.

I did pretzel sticks because there wasn't really a whole lot of dough. Tasted alright but not what I was expecting really.

I thought these were very good, but I did dip into baking soda water before cooking.  I don't know how it would be possible to get 12 pretzels from this recipe.  I was able to get 2 small pretzels and 2 breadsticks.  I also thought 12-15 minutes was too long to cook.  I cooked for 10 minutes and they were still rather crunchy on the outside.

This recipe makes the best breadsticks. I spread butter on them and then top with garlic salt or cinnamon before baking. My kids ask for them almost everyday!

I like to substitute half of the flour for whole wheat flour and use 1 tsp brown sugar instead of white.  Try dipping the pretzels in a baking soda bath (2 c hot water, 2 TB baking soda, then drain) before salting and baking.  It helps give it an all-over browning.  It definitely is a more "bready" pretzel than the traditional mall style.

I can't believe my tastebuds are that outta line with the other reviewers. These had no flavor at all.  They didn't taste a bit like the big pretzels at the mall. Will not be making these again.

The dough didn't rise as much as I thought and it wasn't that easy to work with but will try again.  I think it might be easier to work with a dough gun to get the correct size roll and and shape.

These were quick and easy to make.  I found that they don't have a lot of taste, but are a decent snack if you eat them the same day you make them.  I also brushed mine with butter, and added garlic salt with the butter on half of them, and that extra flavor helped a lot!

Was looking for a kid-friendly recipe where I could bring all the ingredients to school and we'd be successful. Did not want to bother with the boiling, as we didn't have time or facility to do so. Very pleased with results - several parents at our event requested the recipe. Definitely better when making only 6 pretzels per recipe. We made 7 recipes for 50-60 people, and all enjoyed the experience.

These are very good.  I love pretzels but my husband is not so keen on them, so I made half in a pretzel shape with salt and the other half I made into bread sticks.  We both loved them.  One thing I did do differently though, is I brushed them with butter instead of egg.  These are so much easier than most recipes and just as good.

Tried it and I need to work with the yeast and possibly add more and let it rise longer.  My first batch was okay.
