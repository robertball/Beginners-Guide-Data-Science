I've run into issues with the tenderloins drying out before, so I soaked the tenderloins in buttermilk this time, then took them out and breaded them with sourcream and cheddar baked Lays.  This is so good!!!  I wish I had seasoned the chicken first, but the baking time was perfect and I dipped it in ranch dressing.  Awesome recipe!

Drumnwrite- I tried this recipe because I loved your Sweet Potato Fries.  Well, we loved this too!  Instead of potato chips, I used Bugles, and they came out great.  Fun to eat also. 
Now I have to try your other recipes.  Thanks again.

These were a fun dinner for the kids, they loved the whole chicken on stick idea. I used nacho chips and a ranch dressing for dipping. I thought that the dish was too bland. i will make these again, but next time i will be sure to doctor up the chicken with sasoning before rolling in chips.

You weren't kidding!  My boys ate this so fast that I missed them even eating it!  I did not make the whole recipe, and I wish I would have.  I used BBQ chips and followed the recipe exactly.  I used bamboo skewers and put 4 chunks on each skewer.  It was really easy to make. I  served them up with 3 little sauce dishes containing Ranch Dressing, Ketchup, and BBQ sauce.  They felt so important!

I've made these several times, using various flavors of chips. The biggest hits were doritos and tonights winner, CHEETOES! They were awesome! The cooking time is a lot longer than stated, but my oven is on crack, so 5 stars anyway!

We just finished eating this dish for dinner and it went over extremely well with the whole family!  My two "5-and-unders" quickly polished them off and begged for more. I used a mixture of sour cream & cheddar with plain chips - very cheesy and delicious!  The recipe says it makes 10 servings, and maybe if you're serving them as appetizers that's true, but if it's being served as a main dish, don't plan on it feeding 10 people - they're just too good! I followed the advice of another reviewer and served this with buttered green beans (and carrots)-a perfect combo! THANK YOU! This treat will be returning to our table soon!

I gave this recipe a try at a cocktail party, believe it or not. I used Kettle cooked potato chips and served with ranch dressing mixed with 1 tsp of chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and a spribkle of scallion on top...What a rich indulgence!  to reference the woman who referenced McDonalds...Rest assured if you make it with chicken breasts...you could roll it in crisco and it would still be healthier than McDonalds!! Will use again!

I highly recommend this one for anyone with kids!  I used my kids' favorite flavored potato chips and followed the recipes to a tee.  The chicken was so moist and had a great flavor to them.  My kids like to dip theirs in Ranch dressing.  Thanks

Made these for lunch today.  All of my kiddos (all 10) said they were delicious.  We followed the recipe and dipped them in ranch dressing.  We will definitely have them again.

Great idea!  After reading the reviews, I made the following adjustments and these turned out perfect.  I cut up chicken tenderloins into nugget sized piece and soaked them in buttermilk for a few hours.  I filled half of my food processor with chips (BBQ potato chips, Chili Cheese corn chips and Sour Cream and Onion potato chips turned out the best - tortilla type chips did not get crispy), and processed them until they could not get any smaller.  I then added 1/4 cup - 1/2 cup of flour to the processed chips until you could just see the flour mixed in (add flour a little at a time).  With the remaining whole chips I crushed them with a rolling pin but not too fine so they retained some texture.  We used toothpicks to skewer each chicken piece, coated it in the processed chip/flour blend, then dipped in beaten egg and then covered it in the crushed chips.  We set them on a greased cooling rack on a cookie sheet and baked for 15-20 minutes at 375 degrees.  No need to flip.  Chicken was moist, chips were still crunchy and the flavors of the chip were there without adding any extra seasoning.  Thanks for a fun way to make dinner with my kids!  They had a blast.

This was good with some doctoring. First of all i didnt have lollipop sticks so i used kabob sticks, and made chicken into "strips" on the sticks.  I seasoned the chicken WELL, because a lot of reviews stated they were bland. So i seasoned with salt, garlic powder and pepper.  I floured the pieces first to allow the egg to stick. Then dipped into the crushed lays BBQ potato chips.  They were wonderful.  And we used bbq sauce to dip them in.  The BBQ chips worked as a good breading because it had a mild bbq flavor.  Hubby was impressed and my son loved it!

I have 5 little ones, all with such different tastes, so this recipe was perfect for our family. It was one I could have all of them involved in. We started by letting each child choose their own kind of chips.... salt & vineger, flammin hot cheetos, ranch doritos, barbecue, & sun-dried tomato. They loved their dinner. They cleaned their plates & even shared with their siblings.

This was ok, but I was expecting better considering the rating. I even dipped it in italian dressing before coating it and although it helped add flavor, the chicken wasn't crispy which turned us off a bit. If I'm going to eat something that obviously not healthy, I want it to be worth my while. ;) sorry!

Very tasty and easy! I agree with other reviewers that the chicken itself needs some seasoning. To maintain the crispy outer coating an eliminate turning them half way through, I baked the nuggets on a wire cooling rack that I sprayed with nonstick spray and set on top of a jelly roll pan. It allows the air to circulate all around the nuggets.

I gave this recipe to my brother, who is nearly useless in the kitchen, for my niece's birthday party. If he can make this, anybody can, tho i did go over to supervise ;). they turned out nice and crunchy and juicy, and they were nice since the kids were so hyper we could just stick one in their hands and not worry about a mess. the favorite flavor at the party was bbq chips with ranch sauce, tho the parents seemed to like the plain chips better. we tried cheddar and sour cream chips too, but those turned out a little funky and tasted like burnt cheese. and be careful the type of chips you buy, kettle-cooked chips didnt work as well for us, they were a little too hard.

Love it! I was fun to make and very different. I added worcestershire sauce and garlic powder to egg and milk mixture,plus salt and peppered chicken. I used BBQ chips. There are countless ways you can make this recipe. Most important is to season your chicken. I followed anothers review by baking on wire racks on a cookie sheet so you don't have to turn after 10 minutes.

I made these for my very picky children and they loved it.  They always ask for it now.  I used chicken thighs instead of breast and they came out very juicy.  I also found out that if you use pringles they come out crisp and not oily like regular chips.

These were a huge hit with the kids.  I read through all the comments and made them with crushed Cheetos rather than chips.  I cut the chicken breast into strips, threaded them on bamboo skewers, and dipped them in flour first to hold more of the flavor.  (Of course I thought about making them someday for adults with jalapeno or Old Bay flavored chips and adding seasonings to the flour first.)  This will definitely become a permanent part of my repertoire when feeding picky children something other than frozen chicken nuggets!

I made this for my husband once and he thought it was delicious, but then again, he's 130 lbs. I would NEVER feed this to my kids. Way too unhealthy. Potato chips are a once in a blue moon treat, not something to roll my chicken in. But he liked it, and his metabolism can take it.

These turned out really yummy!  After trying BBQ, Sour cream and cheddar and salt n vinegar, we all agreed the salt and vinegar was the best!  As per other reviews that these were bland, I dumped a bunch of salt, pepper, onion, garlic and paprika into the egg mixture to give the chicken a little more flavor and it worked perfectly!

I hate giving a bad review, but I found this very bland as written. I am going to have to experiment with spices, etc. Also the chips took a bit of work to stick to the chicken. I like the idea though.

This was a big hit with our family!  I cut the 4 chicken breasts in four strips each, dredged them each in flour, the egg mixture then the chips.  Baked on a cooling rack set on a baking sheet, so they got crisp on both sides without having to turn.  Served with honey mustard sauce (a mix of dijon mustard, mayo, honey, vinegar and sugar) and bbq sauce.  We will be making this again...great kid friendly entree!

these were easy to make and my hubby loved them.  I used bbq chips and regular.   Next time I wont use ripple as they were harder to crush and roll.

Just made this for dinner. It was ok, nothing special.  We used Doritos, since my four year old daughter loves them.  She only gets them as a special treat, so I thought letting her use them to prepare a meal would entice her to eat it.  Not so much.  We'll try this again with Sour Cream & Onion...

How easy is this??  My boys will be well-prepared to cook for themselves when they are on their own and I think this will be a staple recipe I send with them.  It's a great way to use up almost-old potato chips.

The CONCEPT of this recipe is great... My 8-year-old son loved helping to make them, and all 3 kids couldn't wait to try them, as they were made with  potato chips....  But all greatness stops there.  All the flavor from the potato chips completely bakes out. (I even tried 2 different flavors of chips, to see which we liked better, but we could not taste the difference in the final product.)  They were bland, but we ate them just dipping them in sauces.  I tried to serve the left-overs later, but they dried out too much on reheating.  Fun idea, but using corn flakes for breading then adding your own spices works MUCH better!

These ended up actually being better than I thought they would be!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used 1 egg, 2 Tbs. of milk, and 1 Tbs. of Miracle whip; whisked it all together and rolled in the chips (to which I had added some pepper and salt).  I used both BBQ and sour cream and onion potato chips to see which we liked better.  I also combined both chips just for the heck of it.  Cooking time is just right the meat was tender.  Definitely turn them over after the first 10 minutes.  Good, quick and kid-friendly!  Thanks!

These were pretty tasty, the kids loved them, the husband and I thought they were just pretty good.  I used boneless, skinless thighs cut into strips, then put them on skewers.  I used sour cream and onion chips.  Overall, I felt they could use some more flavor.  They were very moist and I will probably make they again for the kiddos!

Really high on the kid fun-factor!  We used sour cream and onion flavored chips and it was super tasty.  It also works with my wheat allergy -- no wheat involved!  We'll definitely be making this again, the kid gives it two thumbs up.

We had this for dinner two nights ago. I did a few things different.  First, I strung the chicken strips on skewers before I baked it, so the chicken would stay on the skewer better.   Second, I used three different kinds of chips: Cool Ranch Doritos, BBQ Lays Potato Chips, and Fritos (which I mix taco seasoning into).  Third, rather than using egg as a binder, I used BBQ sauce for the BBQ chips, Ranch for the Cool ranch Doritos, and Taco Sauce for the Taco Seasoned Fritos.  Of all these variations, the Fritos with seasoning and taco sauce was the best tasting, but they all went down with absolutely no problem, and my husband finished the rest off for lunch the next day.  Do make sure to grease the cookie sheet down like crazy, or the chips try to fall off, and grease it again, if possible, when you flip.

Not that great.  I expected crunchy but it really wasn't.  Not much flavor from the chip came through; I used Lays BBQ.  It's so easy to make I'll probably give it another try with a different chip, maybe Jay's HOT BBQ.   Here's a tip - squeeze the chips on to the chicken it helps more chips stick to the chicken and that means more chip flavor.

This was a fun recipe to try. I could see it being a hit at a party.  I think next time, to make the chips go farther I might try doing 1/2 crunched chips with 1/2 breadcrumbs. It seemed like I needed a lot more of the crunched chips than the recipe called for in order to cover my chicken.

I'm sorry but this was totally tasteless even using barbecue chips.  I had to slather on the ranch dressing just to get some sort of taste.  This is the first thing in my fridge as far as leftovers that has actually gone to waste.

Wonderful! Crunchy baked chicken is a hit.  I used full chicken tenders and followed the recipe except I seasoned my chicken first.  10 minutes each side was perfect timing in oven.  THanks for the recipe.

These were a huge hit with my meat hating kids...lol. I got them involved by picking the chips (cool ranch doritos and plain tostitos) and letting them reduce the chips to powder with hammers. A great recipe for everyone. I skewered my cubes instead which turned out great.

Ok, maybe I somehow did something wrong, but this came out really, REALLY bland.  I should've added more seasoning to the actual chicken--that's my fault.  Of course, it also doesn't say to do that, so technically I did follow the recipe almost exactly as written, and it turned out so tasteless we didn't even eat it.  I saved the cooked chicken for another dish.  It was so bland that when I peeled away the batter, it went great in some quesadillas (with more and different seasoning, of course).

Honestly, I don't know how everyone else is getting theirs to turn out well.  I picked cheddar cheese and sour cream ruffles.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm sorry, but it's pretty bad when you can't even SERVE it.  Not a good recipe (for me, anyway).

Made this tonight and it is a fantastic recipe! A huge hit with all 3 of my kids (aged 7,3 & 1) My 3 year old loved to help make it! We used multigrain tortilla chips (because that is all we had) and crushed some in the blender and some with our hands to get different textures.  Also, i skewered the chicken and grilled it on the BBQ rather than baking it in the oven. Will definately be making this one again!

We all really enjoyed these.  I used plain chips and sour cream and onion and a few I used corn chips on, because I ran out of chips.  They were all equally delicious.  It was a great recipe to make with my son, because he was able to help by crushing the chips for me.  I served it with honey mustard and ranch.   A definite keeper in my house.

These were really delicious.  Because my family was super hungry when I made them, I didn't bake them.  I instead pan fried them up really fast as little chicken nuggets.  They were on the table in about 15 minutes and my fam. loved them.  Thank you for this super easy recipe!  (Oh, I used Light Ruffles.)

This is great! I really enjoyed the change of pace with the "breading" for these nuggets. I used Lays White Cheddar flavour potato chips to coat my nuggets and I did pre-marinate the nuggets in my personal marinade before dipping and coating. I had no problem with the baking time and while these did not turn out crunchy for me, I thoroughly enjoyed them and can't wait to have them again. I also didn't bother to skewer them and just ate as chicken nuggets alongside macaroni and cheese.

This is a great recipe for chicken when you want something different other than just fried chicken. I left out the skewer sticks and just put the chicken on a cookie sheet and cooked them. They turned out great with a great taste.

I made several versions on skewers using the little lunch-sized bags of chips - cheetos, doritos, ranch doritos and club crackers!  My 9-yr old loved them all.  Next time will try with baked chips to cut the fat, and just make them chicken-finger style and skip the sticks.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for using cheddar & sour cream chips, except that I used chicken tenders. While the chicken wasn't bad, it was bland.

Some of the reviews were saying these were bland, I was saying they must be crazy, with all the flavor in the chips,(I used cool ranch doritos)why would you need to add seasoning to the chicken? but you do!!  next time I will use some salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder to season the chicken before I put on the chip coating.

My picky 8 and 3 year old LOVE this recipe.  I made it with cheese flavored pringles and it actually melts a bit and makes a crispy cheesy crust.  Much healthier than frying with all the flavor!

I made these last night.  I followed a couple suggestions such as adding a little seasoning to the chicken before hand and I used Sour cream and onion, chile and lemon, and goldfish crackers as coatings because we all have different favorites for chips.  I was not really impressed with the flavor of the sour cream and onion ones (kinda blah), but my husband liked the chile and lemon ones and my 3 yr old loved the goldfish ones...that could have been because they were pretty since I used colored goldfish.  Overall the recipe was okay, but not something I will probably make again.

I have to give this a five just for how much my kids loved this; what's not to love chips and chicken.  It is a yummy recipe.  I baked the chicken and served with some different dips; bbque, honey mustard and ranch.

WOW, what a great recipe. Made chicken piccita for the grownups and had this for the kids. Made lollipops up first & baked while I cooked piccita. Served piccita with angle hair, so the kids had theirs with jar sauce. Toss a salad, add garlic bread & you have a great meal for everyone. 2 quick hints, break the sharp tip off the skewer 'cause they will want to eat them off the stick and save your extra sauces from the fast food restaurants so you will have them if you want to pack for a school lunch. Thanks for such a simple but great idea!

wow! I added some salt-free garlic herb spices to the egg mixture and put these on a rack instead of flipping them, as suggested by others also I skewered chicken breast 1/4s before dipping them in the egg and chips . dill pickle, suprisingly good; ketchup good; sweet chili heat doritos by far the best.
everyone enjoyed these and even my usually well behaved dog is begging for one!

These were nice and simple to make. I used half BBQ potato chips and half plain, and added a bit of black pepper and garlic powder. I didn't use the lollipop sticks, but the kids still ate them up!

These were bland. Made exactly as written.  I think they would be better to be marinated in something first. They were also dry, so I'll have to mess with timing to not over-bake. Also they didn't crisp up so I'll try baking them on a wire rack next time.

Made this last night and I have to say we truly loved the coating. It came out of the oven crispy like fried chicken. I used thin cut chicken breasts and used kettle cooked original potato chips. I put the potato chips in a small food processor to crush the chips which is a lot easier than trying to crush them on a plate. I sprayed the pan well with pam and baked for 10 min then flipped and then another 10 min. The coating stayed on the chicken perfect. We really enjoyed this chicken.

Don't overcook, otherwise the chk gets dry.
BBQ, Ranch is good.  Best if crumbs are crushed in food processor.

These taste better when you leave them in long enough to get crunchy. Very easy recipe and we skipped the sticks and just made them into small strips/cubes. Used sour cream & Onion chips will try BBQ chips next.Great recipe!Thanks!

Didn't care too much for the recipe. The chips didn't quite stick to the chicken resulting in the end product not being much different than the usual chicken nuggets.

These were pretty good, but I seem to agree with others when I say they were a little bland.  I even seasoned the egg/milk mixture with salt, pepper and onion powder first and used sour cream and onion chips.  I also think the oven maybe could be higher, because the chips weren't really that crispy.  Had I cooked them longer, I would have overcooked the chicken as the tenders I used were juicy and perfect!

I just tried this last night.  I used baked bbq Lays chips.  Something about the baked Lays has a funky taste.  They were really good but I would never use that type of chip.  We were thinking of trying baked Cheetos next time.  Love those!! VERY EASY and a great way of making nuggets!!

This is my first time to ever rate anything!!I had to do it!! They were a hit! Very rarely do I cook something and both of my young children and my husband applaud!! They were delicious. I tried a few different spices for doctoring the chicken and some different types of chips. I used sunchips for the whole grains in ranch and harvest cheddar. Both flavors were great with all the spices (garlic on some, season salt on another, & s&p) garlic and lawry season salt tasted the best but all of the cruncy chip coatings tasted good. I also used a plain baked potato chip. wonderful!! those were my kids favorite. I am going to make these over and over. i am going to make a huge batch for a school picnic this weeked. my only question, the recipe says to cut chicken into small chunks but the pictures look like strips. we made it work. wonderful recipe, thanks so much. anyone who does not enjoy them maybe should try again because you probably did something wrong! i dont see any child or adult not loving these chicken pops!

We really did not like these...seasoned the chicken as a few reviewers suggested...made 1/2 bbq chip and 1/2 doritoe..was really looking forward to them. We were really disappointed! Not worth the effort!

I have done a similar one by stringing chicken breast strips on wooden skewers, brushing with egg wash and rolling them in the chips and baking them. Great for kid's parties! They love anything they can pick up with their fingers. Even my "tween" granddaughter loves it.

I was really excited to try this recipe, although a little skeptical. After reading all of the reviews I decided to go for it and it came out fantastic! I did follow the advice of others and I seasoned the chicken before dipping them in the egg mixture and chips. Make sure you crunch up the chips into really small pieces so they stick to the chicken. I put mine on a plate and covered it with a tea towel and used a meat cleaver to do the smashing! I also made mine into strips and let out the skewers. I can't wait to try different chip flavours! Cape Cod Originals are good for a basic!

My kids liked these but I couldn't seem to get them crispy.  I cooked them on a rack over a cookie sheet so they would brown evenly but it didn't quite work.

I was very surprised that my kids didn't like these.  I think that the chips needed to be crushed more, but that wasn't the recipes fault.  I used regular potato chips, so if I do try it again it will be with some flavored chips.

Kids loved it-crushed sour cream and onion chips, but made it a little healthier by using egg beaters to dip it in instead of eggs, kids couldn't get enough!

My family loved them. I just used skewers, and snipped them to fit after the chicken was on. And I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, dipped them in Italian dressing, then coated them with the potatoe chips with a little bit of bread crumbs mixed in. Great recipe. Fun finger food.

Delicious, I will definitely make this again!  I used regular potato chips and the only change I made to the recipe was seasoning the egg mixture before I dipped the chicken in.

This was just ok.  I used Lay's cheddar & sour cream and bbq chips since that's all I had on hand.  It turned out crispy and the chicken was juicy but it was quite bland on flavor.  Husband said that it was just ok and that we shouldn't make it again, I agree.  Thanks for the recipe though.  It was super easy! I think it would be a great recipe for kids.

Not very impressive- I made with BBQ chips, kind of bland.  I wouldn't make it again.  Probably fun for kids at a party, though.

A most excellent snack food!!!  My husband and I loved these and they are so quick & easy to make.  Good for Super Bowl parties and impromptu movie premieres (just kidding about the movie premieres).  I did make one change.  We crushed up Town House whole wheat crackers for a little bit healthier twist.

It was a lot of work for something that didn't even taste good. My four-yr-old only ate a little bit and only because they were on sticks.  I'd rather just bake chicken with seasoning and put it on a stick than do the chip mess again.

What a great way to use up leftover chips! I had two chicken breasts in the fridge that I needed to get rid of, so this was a great solution for a pre-dinner snack for hubby and my daughter. I only had plain potato chips, but I added garlic and onion powders and a bit of black pepper to help flavor. Hubs dipped in catsup and Tyler used barbeque sauce. Didn't make them into pops but they enjoyed them just the same. Thanks!

Personally, I did not care for these. I used BBQ chips and dipped in my favorite BBQ sauce. But as I ate them, I remembered being a kid and thought that I would have loved these when I was 10! I think this is a fabulous recipe for the kids...which is hard to do. 5 stars!

This recipe rocks!  My 9 year old daughter and her friends loved this one at her birthday party and I have not stopped making them since! I like them as they are, but if you find them bland try dipping in ranch or my daughters favorite, ketchup!

Made this for my son for lunch.  Daddy had to work and I was off this week because of Christmas.  He loved it (2 yrs almost).  I will admit that it was a little bland with the plain chips but the bbq chips tasted much better.  Son dipped it into ketchup so he didn't mind.  Thanks for a fun way to treat my kid to lunch.

I'm rating these for the audience they were intended for...my grandsons. They were a major hit w/ the grands...I have neevr seen them eat so much! They ate at least 1/2 this recipe by themselves! I used sour cream & onion chips & I made them  fry sauce & ranch dressing for dipping. From a grown-ups point of view, I'd think they'd rate 3 1/2*s. I served buttered green beans & a salad w/ this.  Thanks DRUMNWRITE!

Food on a stick... how fun.  I made this for my son using the bottom-of-the-bag crumbs from lo-fat ridge-y potato chips.  Dipped in milk mixed with a bit of ranch dressing (out of eggs...) before rolling in the crumbs.  When done, I inserted long hors d'oeuvre skewers and... voila -- chicky pops.  Thanks for a novel dinnertime idea!

These are the best! Made them for a bookclub potluck and they were the first item to go!!  I do soak the cubed chicken in buttermilk overnight, then let drain in a colander while I crush the chips.  For fun, I've crushed several types of chips to roll them in -  1/3 in potato chips, 1/3 cubes rolled in Doritos, 1/3 rolled in Cheetos. It's a personal preference, but my favorite are the cheetos :)

We don't chop the chicken or use skewers, but we DO cut the chicken into strips (if we are using breasts). This is such a kid-friendly recipe! This is one recipe I want my children to learn before they leave home. It's easy to make and would be perfect for college students or newlyweds. :)

My husband, whose tastebuds stopped maturing at age 7, LOVED these! He likes simple straightforward foods, and thought these were fun and delicious. They're a fun and easy meal to make for a game day. It's also fun to get creative with different dipping sauces (bbq sauce, honey mustard, ranch, ketchup, etc) paired with different chips (doritos, bbq lays, sour cream and onion, etc). Personally, I think they turn out bland no matter what. Even when seasoned before dredged in the chips. But I like spicy complex flavors. Overall, they're an easy fun recipe that you can get creative with. Just don't expect an explosion of flavor.

These are mediocre.  I used regular Cape Cod chips and it was definitely too plain, but I wouldn't hesitate to make them again with seasoning.  The chips do give a nice crunch.

Hey these were good! Kids liked the chip aspect and I did too (I used a baked BBQ chip).  Actually crunchier than our regular recipe. Great Recipe!

Great!  I'm a teacher and never knew the sticks were banned.  You can also throw in Ranch packets, too.  Some schools don't allow H2) bottles because high schoolers have been known to fill them with Vodka (I know-strange!)  I just put a frozen juice box in.  This is a great alternative to PBand J and having to run by Subway the night before :)

This is the second time we made this.  It was definitely better when you remember to flip them!  We did not use the lollipop sticks.  We made 1/3 with potato chips, 1/3 with cheese nips and 1/3 with seasoned bread crumbs.  I also switched the eggs to egg beaters to make it a little healthier.  All 4 of us loved them although I only had the bread crumbs version.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight an my 5 year old said "that was awesome!" Him and my 3 yr old fought over the last one. I also wanted it, but decided to be adult about it :) Followed recipe, used sour cream & onion chips, but added 1/3 of a ranch packet to the egg & milk Mixture and also salt and peppered the chicken before dipping. They were crisp and delicious. Served on a plate with 3 dipping sauces. I am a hero tonight. Thanks!

My kids liked this, my husband and I didn't care for it. I used Terra EVOO/garlic/parmesan chips and added just a little italian seasoning. The kids ate most of the chicken. I'd make it again for a kids birthday party but for family dinner, this recipe just wasn't for us adults.

I didn't like the way these tasted. They were somewhat plain. I think I would add a lot more seasoning to counter act the bread crumbs, but overall, the chicken was moist. It just needed something extra

Everyone loved this recipe when made with BBQ chips.  I also tried with Sourcream and Onion and All Dressed but did not tast as good.  I cut the chicken into smaller chunck and lowered the cooking time.  Kids loved them as a quick snack.

These were good.  I tried suggestions from others and seasoned the chicken before coating. I also fried one batch and baked one batch.  The baked chicken was much better tasting and healthier. My picky 4 year old actually finished his dinner.

I found the chicken very bland.  I used doritos, cheetos, and salt and vin chips.  The S/V chips were ok and the flavor came through somewhat but the doritos and cheetos were very dull.  I didnt have any problems with tenderness the chicken was very moist but was dissapointed with the lack of flavor from the chips.

Yummy! I thought this sounded like a kid- friendly dinner..and something different for us as well..It was so good!  I used sour cream and onion ruffled chips & plain classic chips w/ranch seasoning (would recommend the original style over ruffled..they seem to stick a lot better) and I sprinkled a little Hidden Valley ranch seasoning/dip packet over the top of the chicken for added flavor..served with uncooked broccoli and carrots with ranch for dipping, and a simple pasta salad..we all loved it! Will make this again and again! It was a big hit!

I served these to a large group of kids and they were a huge hit.  I didn't bother with the lollipop sticks, just cut the chicken into "nugget sizes".  I took advice from previous reviews and used parmesan garlic potato chips.  Also, I needed more chips than the recipe asks for - I wanted them to be nice and crispy.  Another bonus - my husband loved the leftovers!

This was a simple, easy dish.  I did marinate the chicken with seasoned salt, garlic, and ranch overnight to give the chicken more flavor.  Paired with seasoned sweet potato fries this was an instant hit with my two-year old!

I didn't use the skewers because giving pointy sticks to my 2 boys, ages 4 and 6 is just begging for a trip to the ER. I used plain curvy Lay's on chicken strips for my eldest, and Spicy Nacho Doritos on strips for my youngest. My 6 year announced that this was "The Best Chicken Ever" and "better than McNuggets".

This was nice, however Iwould recommend seasoning the chicken before you slather on the egg and chips. I used Pringles Bacon and Ranch chips and the flavor of these chips helped a lot

Thank you DRUMNWRITE for this recipe.  I have been searching for a chicken recipe that my 3 year old son will eat and he totally loves it!  My husband likes it as well.  I did exactly as the instructions said and it turned out great!  I used kettle chips.  Thanks again!

These were a huge hit in our house!  I made them with sour cream and onion chips -- our fav and everyone loved them!  My 19 month old twins ate them better than any other chicken nugget type food they've ever had!  I was so flattered they enjoyed my baked chicken better than chick fil'a's fried chicken!

It's all that and more! Kids loved it, and even carb-averse husband wants me to make it for him too. I didn't even thread them on skewers or sticks. Just served them in little chunks. Excellent and easy. Thanks!

We used low fat Sour Cream and Onion Pringles and the kids loved every bite.  Three days later they are still asking when I will make the recipe again.

As I didn't have any potato chips, I made them from a recipe on this site.  I pounded the chicken to make the pieces long and thin so they could be skewered.   I made a honey mustard dipping sauce to serve with them.  (Equal parts honey and brown mustard).  It gave it just the touch it neeed.  Thank you DRUMNWRITE for sharing!

We did not like these and the kids wouldn't eat them which surprised me.  My son LOVES chips!  My husband and I were able to eat them but it's not something we would make again.  They were a bit too greasy (from the chips) for our liking; however, they looked great and the texture was perfect.  Thanks for sharing the recipe though because I do like to try new ones!

Unfortunately I have to agree with most of the others. The flavor was just not there-they were very bland. I "saved" them by dipping them in buffalo sauce and serving them with ranch. I will not be making this one again as is, although I truly think it has potential with flavorings, different coatings, etc..

My 13 year old son and my husband absolutely loved this recipe.  I left the sticks off of the chicken and made it as chicken nuggets.  We will be having this on a regular basis at our house.  So so easy!

This is just ok, not out of this world amazing but edible.  I also had to season the chicken with salt, pepper and some garlic powder for flavor but they still came out a bit bland since plain potato chips are not seasoned at all.  I also rolled the chicken pieces in flower so the egg mixture would stick better and that worked great.  I may make these again some day.

Very good! I used BBQ and Sour Cream and Cheddar chips, and cornered some friends into chip-smashing duty. Made a great snack, will definitely make again some day for a party or hang-out. Forewent the skewers, someone would have lost an eye.

Great idea and the kids loved it.  I used the lower salt/fat lays and added paprika.  I cooked them on my pizza stone.  No oil or spray even necessary.  Thanks for the great idea.

My whole family loved this, even my finicky 5 year old!  I used Lay's potato chips and Nacho Cheese Doritos, and wished I hadn't skimped on the chicken (only made 1 1/2 breasts).  Dorito ones didn't need to cook as long as chip ones, they actually got a bit dry.  We used Frank's Buffalo Hot Sauce and served with Blue Cheese Dip for the adults and honey mustard or plain for the kids.  LOVED THESE

I have made this several times and it was a bit with EVERYONE. I have used bbq, plain, doritos, and sour cream and onion. They all taste great! Make sure to crunch the chips really really well so it sticks better! I use my meat tenderizer and crunch the hec out of them!

tried this tonight with bbq chips and it was pretty good.  my 2 boys loved it and my husband said it wasn't bad.  i had problems with the chips sticking to the chicken.  i think i may have put in a bit too much milk or i didn't crush up the chips enough.  all in all, i will try again and with another flavor.

I think this recipe is a really neat idea and it has a high "fun factor", but the taste was just ok.  I used sour cream and Cheddar chips the first time.  I will probably make again, but I will try to find a more flavorful chip or I'll season my own chips.

Uhm..Ihate to be a party pooper, but these were not that great.  I thought it was a great idea and my kids would love it but that wasn't the case.  I did season the chicken and roll it in a sour cream and ceasar mixture then rolled it in Doritos.  Smelled great but tasted just o.k.  Will stick with slouvaki I think.

These were very good.  The first time I made them I used plain potato chips.  The second time I used ranch potato chips.  This recipe is much better using a chip with some flavor to it. Overall my family liked them.  I liked how easy they were to make and it does not require too much in the way of ingredients.

Yummy! Great idea. I found that the chips adhere very well with just sour cream .

These are very good.  I used plain chips and added garlic powder to them.  I also did some in BBQ chips.  I did them as strips on sticks also.  I also did some plain chips with added lemon pepper to the mix of chips.  I did not have to turn mine and they were nicely crunchy.. thanks for a way to use up the end of the bag of chips.

[[UPDATE 4/08 - i tried this recipe with doritos and regular breadcrumbs. i liked that much better, and dipped in mustard. i think the doritos would be good with shredded cheddar melted on top.]] i used sour cream and onion chips, and the breading became soggy and fell off. i think it may have been my technique so i'm going to try this again.

I've made these a couple of times now, and they were a big hit each time.  This last time I marinated them for 30 minutes in an Italian dressing, this gave the chicken a little more flavor, without taking anything away from the flavor of the potato chips (sour cream & onion is our favorite, bbq- not so good) Not as good once they've been refrigerated, so make them right before you serve them.

It was really great, but definitely needs BBQ sauce, when using BBQ chips.

We had bite-sized potato chip chicken as an appetizer at a neighborhood party the other night.  My friend served them with toothpicks instead of the lollipop sticks.  She used sour cream and onion flavored chips, and you can use BBQ flavored chips too.  Make sure you have dipping sauces for the chicken:  BBQ sauce, dijon mustard, ranch dressing.  So clever and easy to make.  They were a hit with everyone!

Very good! My kids and husband liked them alot. I tried with BBQ potato chips. The only thing I will change next time is to add a little seasoning to the egg.

All the kids and adults at my son's fourth birthday loved these! As far as kids are concerned these are the best food they can eat.. chips, chicken nuggets, doesn't really get much better!  I thought they were actually a little bland though, but good with bbq sauce.
