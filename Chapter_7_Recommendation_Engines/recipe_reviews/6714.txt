I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, two egg whites for the egg, and 1/4 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup Splenda for the white sugar.  They were DELICIOUS and so moist!  I've been trying to adapt a muffin recipe for awhile now and this is the first time I've tasted success.  With my substitutions, each muffin has only 0.5 grams of fat and 110 calories!

These are the best!  I did as some suggested by using half whole wheat flour and half white flour, also half white sugar and half brown sugar (plus an additional 1 Tbl of sugar), and added chocolate chips to the batter.  My kids can't get enough of these - they are great for breakfast and for snacks.  I have made this recipe at least half a dozen times and it is fool proof.  Great texture and taste.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Karen!

I'm on a low fat diet, so I altered this recipe a bit & used applesauce instead of the oil, egg beaters for the egg, & skim milk.(If you are using paper liners in your pan, be sure to spray them with non-stick spray before filling) I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips & 1/2 cup of chopped nuts. I can't keep these muffins around! I have made 4 batches since last Friday!

I used all whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup white sugar, two eggs, and three over-ripe bananas. I did add a half teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg at the last minute. Super moist and really just.....good. It really does need that extra egg. Next time, I'll use applesauce instead of oil.

This is a great recipe. The muffins have a really good texture - not too heavy, not too crumbly. I substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil and used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Great flavor - the taste of banana really comes through, not too sweet.

This recipe was great, although it does need nuts in it.  Quick and easy.  I made mini muffins (bake 10-12 min.) and they turned out beautifully!

I made this recipe with my 1st graders in Taiwan after we read a story about goats that make oat muffins (long 'o' sound).  I let them mix the things and mash the bananas and we made extras for the other teachers who were asking for this recipe.

Great muffins!  Very moist and delicious.  I added a mashed up apple and decreased oil to 1/4 cup.  They were wonderful.

Excellent muffins!  Substituted the oil with applesauce and half the white sugar with brown sugar.  Great chewy texture with the oats, just the right amount of sweetness, and they freeze well too.  Made these a second time, but had no applesauce, so I just used an extra banana instead of the oil- still good but a little heavier.

Great recipe. To make them healthier I used 3/4 all-purpose AND 3/4 whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup BROWN sugar instead of white, 3/4 cup BUTTERmilk instead of regular, 1/3 cup COCONUT oil instead of vegetable oil. Additions I made: 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and I used 3 med bananas (which I processed in our BlendTec because I don't always like biting into big squishy chunks of banana). I also topped these with a crushed/processed almond, brown sugar, salt and flour mixture  to give them a sweet & (mildly) salty flavor. Since I eat muffins with a smoothie or coffee pretty much every morning without fail, I bake all my muffins ahead of time (along with a couple other recipes for variety), wrap each one individually, and freeze them. They'll stay good for about a month frozen. In the mornings I warm them in the microwave for about 30 seconds and they're perfect.  And since I usually have these ingredients on hand, this makes it a keeper muffin recipe. Thank you!

These muffins are fabulous – even my three year old loves them!  I’ve been making them for about six months now – I bake up a batch just about every weekend, because they make for a quick, healthy and delicious breakfast during the week (if you put them in a tightly sealed container and place them in the refrigerator, they should last about 4-5 days).  To make it a bit healthier (but still yummy), I use ¾ cup Whole Wheat Flour and ¾ cup White Flour.

In addition, I add ¼ cup Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips and ¼ cup Dark Chocolate Chips to the batter.  I found that baking them at 400 degrees was too high, as the outside would cook faster then the inside.  So I bake them at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, and they always come out just right.  Enjoy!

I added in 1 c. frozen blueberries for a little something extra and baked as 2 loaves at 350 for 50 min.  Even my husband who does not normally compliment things told me how good the banana bread was.  Extremely moist and yummy!

Excellent! I made these yesterday between getting up and getting kids ready for school.  Did not want to waste milk, so I used 1.5% milkfat fermented milk (like liquid yogurt - no buttermilk where I live).  I used a full cup and ended with a runny batter, which I saved using 3 tbsp all bran cereal.  The result: extremely light and delicate muffins, full of flavor and aroma! Great recipe!

Used applesauce in place of oil and added @ 1/2 cup of peanut butter, cinnamin and a full tsp of vanilla, but it still tasted like nothing, very weird hhhmmm I am baffled maybe the lack of sugar.

Update: Weird...tried it again used half oil/applesauce and added blueberries tasted great lol its always worth trying a recipe twice :)
Made a third time with pumpkin...DEFINITELY NEEDS BLUEBERRIES!!!! Was great with them but bland without

Oooo, wow these are good!  I couldn't resist adding walnuts, cinnamon, and nutmeg to make them resemble the flavor of my grandma's banana oatmeal cookies. I also only put in about 1/3 cup of sugar and substituted applesauce for the oil.  SO good!  I will definitely be making these again very soon!

If you're looking for a sweet muffin (think banana bread), this is not for you.  However, if you're looking for a hearty breakfast muffin or snack, then these are great!  I took the advice of others and substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the vegetable oil.  I also halved the recipe and used 2 small-medium bananas, giving 8 muffins.  I would definitely make these again.

These muffins are awesome!!! Used 3 bananas, which was probably more than the 1 cup that was called for, and added some cinnamon and nutmeg but didn't change anything else. I seriously love these muffins!!!!

Just when I thought these couldn't get any better . . . Try this. Add blueberries (dusted with flour so they won't sink to the bottom) to the batter. Then sprinkle the tops with cinnamon sugar before baking.

Yum!  I made a couple of changes: used about 1/3 cup of maple syrup instead of sugar and substituted Lighter Bake (prune/apple puree) for oil and soymilk for milk.  Delicious!

I picked this recipe because I wanted to try a banana muffin with vanilla and everyone who reviewed it seemed to love it.  I usually use a banana wheat muffin recipe on this site that uses mayonnaise.  My original recipe is much better with less ingredients.  The only substitution was 1/2 cup wheat flour.  I didn't care for the spongy density of this recipe.  I won't make again.

thank you for this recipe.  i am on a very low sugar diet and this is the best muffin recipe that i have found.  i used whole wheat flour and i also added cinnamon and in addition to the vanilla extract i added black walnut extract.  i also only added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of sugar instead of the 1/2 cup called for.  these are the absolute best muffins around.  and my kids ages 5 and 7 loved them.  angela

I exchanged the oil for applesauce, added 2 1/2 bananas and half the flour with whole wheat flour. I also added chocolate chips. Maybe peanutbutter next time too. I think next time I will cusinart the rolled oats to course flour and ad the oats that way. I liked the texture and that they were not too moist or sweet. Thanks, this will be a regular.

Like other reviewers, I used applesauce instead of veggie oil.  1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar instead of 1/2 c white sugar.  I also added chocolate chips.  I found this made 24 muffins and about 18 minutes to bake.  Very good recipe!

These muffins tasted healthy, but I'm not used to making healthy ones. I followed other user's suggestions and "healthified" them even more: used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar (plus 1 tbsp. white), and subbed applesauce for the oil. A little bland, but I made them for my 1 1/2 yr old toddler who LOVES muffins for bfast, and she loved them!

There's no better word for me to describe these than "boring". I even added cinnamon, nutmeg, and almond extract to the mix and I still think they are pretty hard to choke down. Though, they have a nice rounded top, despite what other reviews stated. I got 12 regular muffins and 10 mini muffins from the batter.

Great muffins!  I had extra banana so I doubled the recipe.  I also substituted half wheat flour and half brown sugar.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1 cup mixed walnuts and pecans (extra ingredient amounts for the double recipe).  I recommend watching the baking time as they were done in my oven 1-2 minutes early.

I make these all the time, they are so easy and yummy. 
I often use whole wheat flour, brown sugar or honey, and replace the oil with applesauce. I also like to add a handful of dried cranberries.

Added note: 7 7ears later and I am still baking this recipe all the time! There are some in the oven right now. Must be a good one!

Delicious!  I made them vegan and a bit healthier: I replaced the egg with 1/2 mashed banana; used more oats and less flour (1 1/2 C oats, 1 C flour); less sugar (1/4 C); soy milk instead of regular milk.  Nice and moist on the inside, nice and brown on the outside.  I used a very lightly oiled non-stick muffin pan and no paper cups; I let them cool in the pan on a wire rack before gently removing them.

Did you know that Dunkin Donuts muffins have more calories than their donuts?  I made this recipe with apple sauce instead of oil, half whole wheat flour,  and half sugar/half Splenda.  They were good, but next time I'm going to add cinnamon and maybe raisins. By the way, 1 cup of mashed bananas equals 3 medium sized bananas.

These are fabulous! Substitute orange juice for the milk, and use only 1/2 cup of sugar.  In place of white flour i used whole wheat.  Wonderful recipe :)

A good, healthy snack!  Subbed in 1/2 flour as whole wheat, 1/2 of the sugar as brown sugar and used applesauce instead of oil.  Kids love them, especially for breakfast!!

Now that's a muffin! A little crisp on top, moist in the center, and a hint of banana. The only substitution I made was using brown sugar instead of white. I just like the way brown sugar and bananas taste. Mmmm. Thanks!

An excellent, healthy use for overripe bananas! In addition to using half whole wheat and half white flour, I added about 1/4 cup of milled flax seed. I also used about 1.5 cups mashed bananas. This made enough for 12 large muffins and 12 mini-muffins. They did cook more quickly than indicated in the recipe -- mine were ready at 15 minutes. Very moist and delicious.

I've definately had better banana muffins before! These weren't horrible, but they were not great either. Adding  chocolate chips or chopped nuts would definately add to the flavor of these very plain tasting muffins. I wouldn't make these again.

I doubled this recipe and used a cup of buttermilk and 1/2 cup skim milk instead of just milk.  We also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over the tops of the muffins when they came out.  The kids and my neighbors devoured them. Thanks for the great recipe.  It's a keeper!

A nice breakfast muffin, not overly sweet. I didn't have any white flour so I made it with freshly ground wheat flour, and it was moist and fluffy, not heavy at all! I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg out of habit, but I think it may not have needed it. I also substituted brown sugar in for the white. Loved the oats in it!

Yummy Yummy Yummy. I've used applesauce instead oil and 1/3 whole wheat and they were still moist, chewy, yummy and with a slightly crisp muffin top. If I didn't say it enough I'll say it again--yummy yummy yummy.

nice colour and texture.  a nice change from regular banana muffins.  i added chocolate chips but i think it needed a bit more sugar.  i'll make them again with 1 cup of sugar and will bake them at 375F so i can bake a bit longer without browning the top too much... maybe its just my oven though.

I'll make these again as I loved the idea of banana/oats.  The texture is fabulous... but they need to be a tad sweeter. Will keep trying with brown sugar or honey or applesauce.  Nuts would be a great addition, but didn't have them.  Used 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat. Again, loved the texture.  It is a keeper but needs to be tweaked!

I just love this recipe! I've made it as is, and substituted the banana to make several lower calorie types (apple-raisin, and a savory sausage and cheese muffin--my favorite right now!) and they come out awesome! The oatmeal gives it a wonderful texture, very nice and I just love them. My 2 year old nephew does, too. Thanks!

I substituted apple sauce for the oil, and this recipe was out of this world! I blinked and they were gone. Also sprinkled the top with oats for some personality.

I ground the oats in a coffee grinder, and used whole wheat flour. I also added 1 tbsp vital gluten flour to help them rise. My 4 y.o. son also insisted on adding raisins. A great healthy muffin. And because he made them, he eats them like crazy!

Excellent muffins!!! I can't stop eating them!  The oats give them a really nice texture.  The recipe calls for "rolled oats" which I interpret to mean the long cooking type.  I used quick oats instead.  I've not yet tried these with the long cooking type but other recipes I've tried usually come out lighter and more moist with the quick-cooking type oats. I did made a few changes.  I added 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans.  The only other change I made was to use a generously greased muffin pan in lieu of paper liners (didn't have any).  I was worried they might stick but I had no trouble at all.  I baked for the minimum time and took them out and let them sit for 5 minutes in the pan before I removed them to a cooling rack.  They popped right out easily.  I will definately make these again exactly the same way I made them today.

Used 3/4 c whole wheat, 3/4 c unbleached, raw sugar and almond milk.  Added chocolate chips.  Refrigerated overnight in muffin tins. Placed in cold oven while preheating. Once oven reached 400, baked 20 minutes.  Perfect and moist!!

This is a great recipe to use up old bananas. I've made these twice and would recommend adding a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. Very yummy in the morning with coffee for a breakfast on the go!

These were good.  To give them a little more flavor, the next time I made these I added some cinnamon, netmeg, and cloves.  I also used 1/2 white flour, 1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, and substituted most of the oil with applesauce.  I made several batches of these for my daughters snack day at school and the kids loved them.

Good muffins!  I did make them with gluten free flours and oats and they were very tasty and held up well for a couple of days.  I will add more banana next time for flavor and moistness, but that's not the recipe it's just a help for gluten free taste and texture.  Thanks! Karen!

These muffins were pretty good, but not as moist as I had hoped they'd be. I think the addition of the oats added to the dryness, so next time I'd either cut the amount of oats in half or omit them completely. I added some chocolate chips, which I thought were a great addition. Walnuts would be nice too!

I've been baking these muffins for months as a tasty alternative breakfast.  The only addition to the recipe has been 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  These muffins are wonderful, and even better with cinnamon.

Delicious!
The only think I changed was that I used 1 cup all purpose flour plus 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Other than that, I followed the whole recipe.
I may have to add more vanilla next time because I barely noticed it in the recipe.

My kids LOVE these muffins.  Plus, with only 1/2 cup of sugar in the whole recipe, and using rolled oats, it's much healthier than store bought muffins or pastries.  I also like how EASY this recipe is - no need to get out a mixer!

I make these dairy and egg free for my toddler son. I use 1/4 cup applesauce/cinnamon applesauce to replace the egg and soy milk for the milk. I have also used almond milk. I also add cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.  They always turn out delicious. My whole family loves them

Very moist and delicious! Nobody who ate these guessed that oats were in them...the oats just blended in perfectly to add a great texture and more chewiness. I even put less sugar and oil and it still turned out nice! Very filling and satifying treat - is great as part of a healthy breakfast!

Delicious! I use a combination of whole wheat flour, white flour, and Red Mill soy protein powder, and less sugar and oil; with more banana to make up for it. I add 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts and sometimes 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips.  We like to freeze the extra. Zap a frozen one for 30 secs. and it's like a freshly baked muffin.

I used half whole wheat and half white wheat flours, steel cut oats, brown suagr instead of white, unsweet almond milk, and 2 T canola oil...these turned out fantastic..I took them to my running group and everyone raved about how good they were...and good for them. Thanks for a recipe that is great the way it is and can also be changed easily for preference.

If 3 1/2 stars was available I would vote that. They are decent muffins, not too time consuming to make, and not too dry. However, that said, I didn't think they were anything too special. They are quite dense and lacking in flavour. Granted, I did make a few substitutions: 1/2 cup WW flour + 1 cup white instead of 1 1/2 cups white; Ener-G egg replacer instead of the egg; and applesauce instead of oil. I really don't think those changes should have made a huge difference in flavour and texture, though. I think the recipe would be greatly improved even by adding a tsp or 2 of cinnamon in the mix, and maybe a little nutmeg or a pinch of cayenne. They are just a little too bland for my liking. Thanks, though! Oh, I also baked for only 15-16 minutes and they were done.

We usually make a family banana bread recipe with our overly ripe bananas, but yesterday  I made these instead for/with my toddler, and she loved them--both the baking and the eating!  I left out the oats, increased the flour to 2 cups and used half whole wheat/half unbleached white.  Also used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar; 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup veg oil, and decreased the milk to 1/2 cup.  Made 20 mini muffins for her, and leftover batter for 5 big muffins for us.  Lovely warm out of the oven, but my husband and I both thought they were just a bit bland, so would definitely include some spice (cinnamon & nutmeg) next time.  We will definitely be making them again!

Good but not great - there are definitely better banana muffin recipes out there!

I added chocolate chips but otherwise stuck exactly to the recipe.  I cooked them for less time than directed based on other reviews and they were nice and soft, not overdone.

These are delicious! Thank you for your recipe. I make them often for my children. Rather than make large muffins, I use the mini-muffin tray and make 36-40 of them. They go over great with the picky kids and look wonderful in a teeny tiny size.

Great muffins and very healthy! I substituted the oil for applesauce and used half all purpose & half whole wheat flour. I added a handful each of flax seed (ground) and wheat germ and about a cup of chopped walnuts, YUM!!

Very yummy muffins!  I used 1c white flour and 1/2c wheat flour, used applesauce instead of oil and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Also added some mini chocolate chips and used a mini muffin tin (10-11min) - made about 54 muffins.  They are perfect and my 2 year old loves them!

For a lighter version, I replaced all but 2 tablespoons of the oil with unsweetened applesauce. I also only used 1/3 cup of sugar and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. This makes 180 cals/3.8 fat per muffin. I also used quick oats with no problem.

I liked these pretty well, and my husband loved them.  The original recipe is good- but I prefer the alterations that I made the next time around.
I substituted the white sugar with 1/4c plus a bit of brown sugar
I used 1/4c yogurt and 1/4c apple sauce instead of the veggie oil
Double the vanilla
Threw in some mini chocolate chips

Nice and hearty tasting. Added chocolate chips for the kids. Next time will try to half the sugar to brown sugar and use applesauce like others. Overall, nice muffin.

These muffins are fabulous. They are possibly my favourite type of muffin to make. Filling and full of fibre, they are also sweet with the chocolate and tasty thanks to the bananas. Don't overmix or overcook otherwise they come out quite dense!

These are delicious! I made them today for the first time to have on hand for breakfast during the work week. I am used to larger muffins from Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts etc, so I laughed a little at the size, but really, that's the size I should be eating!  The texture is nice and chewy and they are not too sweet, but they are sweet enough. My house smells heavenly even now, hours after the are done baking. I will definitely make these again.

C-. Not the best banada muffin recipe on this site. Muffins turned out very heavy, brick-like. Not sure the if ratio of baking soda/powder listed is correct? Tasted good though but the muffins literally felt like rocks on the bottom of my stomach. Had to take tums. Most likely will not make this recipe again. Thankfully just made it on a Sunday afternoon for family snack. Would be too embarrassed to bring this to an event/potluck/work treat.

Just made these and I followed some of the suggestions. I did half brown and half white sugar, added a full tsp vanilla and added about 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips. They turned out nice, made 12 muffins as indicated. I left out the baking soda just cause it didn't seem like it needed it and some people complained that it tasted like baking soda.                                                   Just a little tip for those who said there muffins turned out to dry, you can't over mix muffins, just mix till its just mixed in, over mixing over works the dough making them hard and dry.

Excellent recipe. These muffins are very moist. I made a healthier version by substituting whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the flour, using stevia in the raw instead of sugar, and adding a bit more banana while cutting back on the oil. And they still tasted great!!

Very easy recipe.  I used less oil and added 1/2 cup walnuts.  Next time, I plan to use applesauce instead of oil. My husband loved them and especially preferred them from the small muffin tin rather than the large!

I've tried several banana oat muffin recipes now.  This one is lighter, non-greasy and not too sweet.  The oats add a nice texture. I added chopped walnuts. This recipe is a keeper.

I've tried dozens of muffin recipes, but this was the absolute BEST!  I will definitely recommend to everyone and have already made 3 batches within 1 week!  Can't seem to keep them in the house.  They're so fluffy, light and moist.  I added chocolate chips to them and that added sweetness, and I found the oatmeal to be the secret ingredient to these muffins.

Very nice and fluffy, not too sweet, not too fat. 
I made it with whole wheat flour and it turned out really nicely. 
My kids (18 months) loved them and I felt good feeding these muffins to them!
I'll definitely be making more!!!

These were not great.  I've made great oatmeal cake, but you have to cook the oatmeal before you mix it into the batter.  I think that would have made these better. Didn't have any brown sugar on hand, but I think that would have also made these better.

I'm giving it a 5 star, because its an excellent basic recipe that can me changed a bit, like other reviewers have noted. I did not make any changes this first time, and my boyfriend loved them just as they are. I will make them with peanut butter chips in the  next batch, a suggestion from my boyfriend.

After reading a bunch of reviews I decided to give it a try.Well I just finished baking these and I'm very disappointed with how they turned out. Maybe it was because my bananas weren't as over ripe as they could have been, but they don't really taste like banana. They rose beautifully and appear to be a tasty muffin but my taste buds weren't  'dancing.' The muffins turned out moist but like others have said, they stick to the paper cups.
I did add 2 tsps of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ground clove. I used half the oil and have strawberry apple sauce and the flavor is still bland.
I am still in search of a better recipe ...

I made the substitutions that others recommended: half brown sugar, half whole wheat flour. I substituted the oil for 1/4 cup applesauce and 1 1/2 tbsp oil. Also added 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chipits and 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. I substituted 1/2 cup of the milk with sour cream and adjusted both the baking soda and baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp. They turned out well. Baked a little faster than I thought. Could use more banana taste, perhaps more bananas next time.

Muffins are nice and light, good banana flavor.  The only modification I made was to use applesauce for half the oil.  The texture and density of the muffins would likely allow for add-ins such as nuts, chips, or flavoring spices.

I substituted 2 TBSP ground flax seed for 2 TBSP of the oil. Gave it a nice nutty flavor and made it healthier. Next time I will substitute the rest of the oil for applesauce.

Alright taste.  A little bland.  I added some butterscotch chips to a few muffins and some dark chocolate chips to others which helped give them a little more flavor.  I did substitute 1/2 the sugar for splenda and NF greek yogurt for the oil.  Okay for a subtle morning muffin, but I think I like my banana bread recipe better.

This is a good muffin recipe. I made it almost exactly as specified, with only a few additions.  I like a little spice in my muffins so I added powdered ginger and cinnamon, the same way I would for my oatmeal cookies.  I also like nuts so I added chopped pecans.  I only had 2 percent milk on hand and used that and it still turned out fine.  Oh I also substituted 1/3 cup of oat bran for the rolled oats. So I did 1/3 oat bran and 2/3 rolled oats.  Even with all that they still turned out good. So I have to say its a solid recipe.

Really good. Followed previous suggestions to use applesauce in place of oil and half whole wheat flower. Meant to use half brown sugar, but forgot. I think that would make these even better.

I used 1 1/4 cup oatmeal and 1 1/4 cup gluten free baking mix from Arrowhead.   I subbed light brown sugar for the white sugar.   I also added walnuts and raisins and cinnamon.  It tasted good but fell apart too easily, probably due to the small egg and the gluten free mix.

I quickly mixed this up to use up an old banana, and it turned out really well with modifications to make it slightly healthier (for my half batch I used just an egg white, also substituted whole wheat flour and applesauce).  I threw in a small handful of chocolate chips, yum.  Perfect texture, not too crumbly or dry at all.

Very delic! I make this recipe every week and my husband and I eat them for breakfast:) It's better how the recipe calls it with just white sugar though instead of doing half brown half white. We do substitute apple sauce for oil though and they turn out amazing!

I made this recipe with oil first...then tried it substituting applesauce for the oil.  I really did not notice a difference.  Very moist!!  So nice to not have to drag out the mixer.  Mine baked for 18 mins. Thanks.

These turned out okay, but I did change the recipe a bit.  I doubled the banana (I like more of a banana flavour) and added blueberries.  I also substituted agave nectar for the sugar and then reduced the milk and oil (since agave nectar adds more liquid).  These were very moist, but tasted like something was missing.

These were really delicious. I did the following substitutions: I substituted 3/4 cup of the all-purpose flour with 3/4 of oat flour, I substituted 1/3 honey for the white sugar and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and a heaping cup of frozen blueberries. I also sprinkled the tops with more rolled oats. The walnuts gave it a bit of crunch and the blueberries little juicy bursts. The honey instead of the white sugar and the addition of the blueberries kept the moisture content right  with the oat flour. I will be making these often:)

Tried this for the first time, and it's a hit with my 1 year old, 4 year old, 7 year old and husband! I added ground flax seed and cooked quinoa and the taste blended well together.

SO delicious!  Moist, great texture, and just the right amount of banana flavor!  I subbed whole wheat flour for half of the flour, as well and it turned out great!

These were great. Unlike others, I kept the oil the same (it's only 1/3 c for 12 muffins). However I roasted about 1/2 c almonds and added them to the muffins and used brown sugar instead of white. They only took 15 minutes to cook and they were SUPER moist!

We loved these - they were ever so slighly chewy (which I love cos you can really sink your teath into them!) and thus most satisfying! Per other suggestions, we used apple sauce instead of oil, brown sugar instead of white. Recipe actually makes 12 large cup cakes. Serve hot, sliced open and buttered! Yum!

Pretty good. I used 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat, applesauce instead of oil, extra 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. I added 2 soup spoons of extra applesauce as the batter seemed too dry. I baked them at 375, 400 seems too high. I put chocolate chips in half the batch and those muffins were MUCH better! Even with the addition of spices and extra vanilla these were rather bland. The chocolate really helped! Not the best banana muffin recipe.

Great muffins, even more healthy if you substitute applesauce for the oil. I always add cinnamon and sometimes walnuts too. Great breakfast and snack.

This left a little to be desired, my husband wouldn't eat them. The main problem was that at 15 min they were on the verge of being burnt. Also I didn't get a lot of banana flavor. If I made these again I'd add a banana, use butter instead of oil, and set the timer for 12 min.

I made these exactly as written in the recipe and the were pretty good.  My kids ate them but weren't super excited about them.  I felt they tasted a bit like flour and not enough banana flavor.

I liked the idea of the oatmeal but read some of the reviews these were a bit bland. SO... like the previous posters I did part wheat flour (1 white/ half wheat flour) and subsituted brown for white sugar. Also added more vanilla (1 tsp instead of 1/2) and some spice....1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 each nutmeg and allspice. I used the 3 ripe bananas I had on the counter...that is probably a bit over a cup/did not measure it.

A good and tasty muffin but was missing just a little something.  Next time I would soak the oats in the milk prior to mixing and add an extra banana to increase the banana flavor.

These are so good! I'm about to make them for the third time. I also made a few healthy substitutions - I used whole wheat flour for half of the total flour, plain applesauce (no sugar added) instead of oil, and opted for brown sugar over white. 18 mins in the oven was a little too long the first time, but 15 mins was perfect last time I made them.

Fantastic recipe. I make these once a week for breakfast. I serve approximately 35 people per day. Everyone loves these. I add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and use a crisp topping 1 to 1 ration of brown sugar, flour and oats and 1/2 c butter. Wonderful muffins!!!

Turned out great, but I took one star off because the temp. was slightly too high & I made a couple changes. I would make them again at 375. I also added chopped pecans, coconut, a couple dashes on cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I substituted applesauce for the oil as others have. Really yummy.

Delicious!
I substituted the white sugar for Splenda (same amount). and the oil for apple sauce (same amount).

I added 1/4 cup of wheat germ (it could have been bran), 1/4 cup of raisins and 1/4 cup of coconut flakes. A tablespoon of oil as well, to compensate for all the extra dry ingredients added. It yielded 14 muffin cups.

This has been the best banana muffin recipe I have made. Deeeeelicious! My kids loved it. Will make it again.

These are great! I added cinnamon. Next time I will put applesauce in for about half of the oil because they were a little greasy for me.

A lot of people said these weren't sweet enough, but I like them this way.

I made these with egg replacer, since my son has a severe egg allergy. They turned out perfect! Delicious, attractive, and perfectly cooked at 18 minutes. I will definitely be making these again, since they are not going to last 24 hours before being eaten!

These are ok.  Not very sweet even with the addition of chocolate chips.  A word of advice....don't use paper liners if you sub applesauce for the oil.  They stick like crazy.

This has to be the best recipe for banana muffins that I have ever tried...and I have tried many!!!! I added chocolate chips, cinnanmon and vanilla to the mix, used whole wheat flour and replaced the oil with applesauce.I also decreased the baking time to 16 minutes. I will definitely be making these again!!!

I followed the recipe exacting and although they tasted great they were quite dry.  Maybe using applesauce as others have done will make them a little more moist.  Worth trying again.

Excellent Recipe.  The muffins smell wonderful when baking!  I put the oatmeal in a food processor to make it a fine texture.  These were gone in one day! With requests for more.  I made a double batch and froze some for quick breakfasts on the go.  Enjoy!

My main complaint is that they stuck to the paper baking cups.  Definitely spray your paper cups before making this recipe.  These were not too sweet and tasted strongly of banana.  I followed the recipe, except I added some chopped dates and Craisins.  I personally thought they were a little bland even with the dates and Craisins.

Loved this recipe! My 3 1/2 year old helped from start to finish and it was quick and easy. We modified a bit and made a less "healthy" version that was very kid-pleasing: subbed in melted butter for the oil, cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Yum!

I used store-bought moist yellow cake mix as a convenient replacement for all of the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and vanilla extract. So I only had to add the oats, bananas, egg (whites) and skim milk. I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil. The muffins came out extremely tasty even with all of the substitutions that made it more healthy as well as convenient. Use Karen's suggestions for liquid and egg instead of the cake mix's suggestions (or else the muffin batter will be too runny due to the extra mashed bananas).

Love this recipe! I made a few changes, but mostly stayed true to the original.   I added 1/2 cup Craisins, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1 tblsp ground flax, 1 apple (minced in the food processor), and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup. Delicious!

I replaced the oil by applesauce and I can't believe how good they are for healthy muffins! They're actually better than most full fat - full sugar - no fibers muffins I've tried!

Wow!!! What a great muffin. I did change a few things due to family diatary restrictions.
I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, used all whole wheat flour, substituted canned pumpkin (equal parts) for the milk and threw in a handful of dried cranberries.
I will absolutly be making these muffins again.

My kids loved these muffins.  I, as others did, used half whole wheat flour, half white, and used applesauce instead of oil.  I also added chocolate chips.  I had enough batter to make 18-24 muffins.  Instead, I filled up 12 very full tins and threw the rest away.  I thought they might overflow but they were perfect, so don't be afraid to fill the tins 3/4 to 4/5 full.

Very good muffins.  The only things I did differently was replaced 1/2 c of regular flour with wheat and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  My 20 month old loved these.  Thank you for the recipe!

These are the most beautiful muffins I've ever made!  They had beautiful peaks on them when they came out of the oven and made my house smell wonderful.  Then I got to eat one and man, oh man!  Sweet and light with lots of banana flavor.  The oatmeal adds a great texture too.  I added some spices as did others.  Will definitely make these again.

I kind of altered the recipe, which is what I do to practically everything I make. I tried soymilk so my mother could also eat these muffins, they turned out excellent! The first time I made these, I only had honey, so I substituted 1/3 cup of that instead of the sugar. I also added some spices: 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, 2 tsp. of cinnamon, 1 tsp. ginger and 1 tsp. cloves. I'm one of those people who use butter for all of their homecooking, so I substituted 4 tbsp. butter for the oil. Great recipe! I'll continue to make it!

This recipe is great!!!  I make it often for me and my children.  Sometimes I substitute whole wheat flour for part of the white flour and I think its a little better that way.  Next time I might try applesauce in place of the oil.

Delicious! I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose. I didn't have quite enough banana so I added applesauce to complete the 1 cup. I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and flaxseed. Muffins were moist and fluffy yet filling. Will definitely make again!

DELICIOUS!!!  My favorite banana muffin recipe so far.  Because of what I had on hand, I used coconut oil vs vegetable oil, 2/3 of the flour was whole wheat, and 1/2 of the oats was oat bran. I added 1 diced apple and a dash of cinnamon, as I had apples that needed to be used.  I also was told by a wise cook to always double the vanilla in any recipe, so I did.  I took them out when they looked and felt best.  They were the perfect constancy!  They were thick, yet moist and soft.  And so yummy.  I was being cautious about over filling and ended up making 14 muffins.  I realized I could have fit all of the batter in 12 muffin cups because I filled the last two muffins much more generously and they rose perfectly, and were big and fluffy.  I'm certain this recipe as written would have been just as good, seeing as I made exchanges for the same type of ingredient.  PS:  I just realized, when deciding to make these again, that I accidentally used only baking soda the first time.  And they were perfect. I'll find out if there's a difference.

I really liked this recipe.  I've made it as is several times for office functions, snacks for road trips or for my family's morning breaks at work or school.  It's good recipe, high fiber and relatively healthy.  After my 4th or 5th go around with the recipe as written, I made changes based on what was in my cupboard.  My favorite change is to add cinnamon,  1/4 cup white sugar and a 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I've also added raisins, or linseed, or nuts and at one time, I added all three.  It works well every time.  I'm inclined to try the applesauce and/or the whole wheat flour as other reviewers have suggested.  The trick is to not overbeat the batter.  It should be well mixed but not lumpy.  And the best way?  Don't use an electric mixer.  Do it by hand!

I didn't have any rolled oats, so I used instant cinnamon roll flavored oatmeal and I used Splenda instead of sugar. My family loved them....as you can see they started eating them as soon as they came out of the oven.

Great muffins.  A good change-up from banana bread.  I like to sprinkle a pinch of rolled oats on the batter before baking them to emphasize the fact that there are oats in them, and cause they're prettier like that.

I added 1  teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground clove, and 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg.  I added a couple handfuls of raisins to half of the batter, and I preferred the raisins being added.  I baked them at 350 F for 25 minutes.

Meh.  They were OK, but not nearly as good as I thought they would be.  Not much flavor to them at all, and I even added cinnamon and blueberries, as reviewers suggested.  The only flavor in these puppies was when I bit into a blueberry.  I might try again trying to add something that might amp up the taste.  WARNING - Mine stuck to the muffin papers, big time.

Yummers.  Okay made a couple tweaks and they turned out great! One thing I find to be important with muffins are the tops, this tweaked version resulted in beautiful perfectly risen tops!  #1 used 1/4 c sour cream then adjusted the milk to 1/2 c. #2 Used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 Brown...which I think may have resulted in a slightly less sweet muffin but with my #3 change ADDING CHOCOLATE CHIPS the sweet factor was perfect! Not too sweet, perfect for breakfast, yet sweet enough to satisfy a dessert craving! My BF loved the oatmeal in them he said the texture was great, and I agree!

These were pretty good. Even more so, considering they are a healthier than normal muffin. I did do 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar like others mentioned doing. The bananas ended up coming to about 2 1/2 bananas. The oatmeal didn't say old-fashioned or quick oats, so I went with the old-fashioned style. I also sprinkled some on top, like others did. It gave them a finished appearance and a nice lite crunch texture. I would definitely do that. I was surprised but the filling came to the top of the cupcake liners. It didn't over-flow at all while baking though. I also used 2 wrappers per muffin, giving it a little more stability. They are a little sweet, but made a nice and easy breakfast with some coffee today.

Great foundation recipe!  I substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil and use 1 cup whole wheat flour & 1/2 cup all-purpose flour.  I also add 1 cup walnuts & add 1/4 cup flaxseeds for some crunch --- delish!

Love this recipe, try substituting half brown sugar, add a teasp. of cinnamon , if you don't have bananas, use applesauce! This is delicious as a muffin, or bread. I did find I needed to  bake at 350 instead of 375. Every time I make them they disapear fast.

Lol what an idi@t I am, I forgot to add sugar! I was going to add half white sugar, half brown sugar. It still turned out very moist but I was glad that I added streusel topping prior to baking. I'm okay with it that the batter was sugarless but I knew it wouldn't pass with my daughter so what I did was slice it half, spread it with banana chocolate spread and sandwiched them....mmm yum. Thought that worked out well. I will definetly be adding this to my recipe folder...of course with the sugar next time!

Doubled the batch and ended up tasting a little bland and had a bit of a baking soda after taste.
Next time will try a little less b/s and adding a little more banana or maybe choc chips or something.

Not great-  would not make again. Even added chopped walnuts and cinnamon and they still lacked flavor. I baked for 15 min and they came out great, just bland.

I'm eating my second one right now--so delicious and light! Made the recipe pretty much as written, except for a couple subs for things I don't have(Silk instead of milk, brown sugar instead of white etc.) and they're awesome. The batter seemed a little runny when I was done mixing, but I didn't add anything and I'm glad! They're very moist and fluffy!

Yum! I used 2 whole bananas, 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour as well as a whole tsp of vanilla. I also had to add an additional 1/2 cup of oatmeal because it was so runny and a tsp of cinnamon.

Excellent muffins. I add frozen blueberries, and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal for even more moisture and an added health boost. My husband and daughter request these muffins on a regular basis. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved it! Followed others' advice and used applesauce instead of oil, brown sugar instead of white, and 1 c whole wheat flour + 1 half cup flax meal instead of AP. I also soaked the oatmeal in milk while I was getting the rest of the ingredients ready, as I used extra-thick rolled oats. They were a little sweet, you could probably get away with less sugar, but they're certainly not going to last very long in this house!

I'd make these again. I used half wheat flour and half applesauce/half oil--the texture was still good. The flavor is not as strong as I like; maybe next time I'll add cinnamon or orange zest or something to kick it up a bit. But overall, these are quite good.

very nice texture, mild and delicate flavor; I topped them with turbinado sugar which gave them a great crusty top.  I will make these again.

These muffins were OK but not great. They were low on flavor. I don't like sweet things and these were not sweet enough for me. I do like the idea of oatmeal in my muffin.

Good, quick & easy - I subbed applesauce for about half the oil.  They were very moist, but stuck to the paper cups due to the lack of oil.  I like that this recipe has the addition of oats instead of all white flour.

Very nice muffin!  I doubled it to make use of many bananas in my freezer!  Made a few small changes per my norm to cut back a bit on calories and fat.  Used both all purpose and whole wheat flour, swapped out the oil and used all unsweetened applesauce and cut back sugar, used about 1/3 cup each white and brown.  Baked mine for 13 minutes or so at 375.  Yummy!

they were.......delicious! just made them. to make them more healthy, i added whole-wheat flour, brown sugar instead of white and  olive oil instead of vegetable. i also added 1 cup cocoa powder, and, it turned out even better! just a tip: if you're making them for the whole family, you might want to double the recipe. hope i helped!

This recipe is spot on for a nice, basic muffin. A  light (but not too light) texture with just the right amount of moisture, sweetness and banana flavor, and a crust that browns up really nicely. The oats add a pleasant element to the texture. I increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and took out 1/4 cup of flour for 1/4 cup of wheat germ which was simply personal preference, not changes the recipe needed. Thanks for sharing a great recipe, and one I will refer back to often.

These were wonderful!!  Exactly what I was looking for!  I loved the oats!  I used 3 bananas.  The only thing I did different was add 1/2 cup mini choco chips.  My kids call them Chunky Monkey Muffins!

I made these just as written and they are awesome!  I'll might try applesauce next time instead of oil just to make them more healthy.  This is a nice alternative to banana bread because they are out of the oven much more quickly!

These were okay, they had a rather funky texture to them and not a ton of flavor.  I added cinnamon.  They looked real nice, but not the best.

Great recipe.  The muffins were delicious, and my husband approved. Normally he won't eat banana bread because it is too refined and sweet. I used 1/4 cup turbinado sugar (instead of 1/2 cup white sugar). I also replaced half of the oil with applesauce.  I replace half of the white flour with wheat flour. Finally, since I don't eat eggs, I left the egg out.  To make everything bind together, I just mixed the wet and dry without the oil, and then added the oil after letting the mixture sit for a couple of minutes. This lets the wheat gluten activate and bind everything together. I'm keeping this recipe!

This recipe is fabulous & I've lost track of how many times I've made it. You simply can't mess it up, no matter what you add or in what form you bake it. I've made muffins, loaves, & cakes. I've added carrots, apples, raisins, nuts, pineapple & flaxseed in various combinations & this recipe still works to perfection. My dog even likes it so much that I make mini muffins without the sugar for her! Very healthy, very flexible, & very much loved at my house. Thanks so much for a great recipe:o)

These muffins tasted like baking soda to me.  There's nothing very acidic in the recipe to react with the soda, so I wonder if it is even necessary.  I will try this again without the baking soda.

I couldn't have been happier for a first bake on a new recipe!  I did substitute applesauce for the oil, and I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and a dash more vanilla.  They baked up beautifully, tender, moist, and delicious, full of flavor.  THANK YOU!  :D

Delicious and healthy!  While these muffins do have sugar and oil in them, it is a small amount compared to other recipes.  The addition and oats and substituting 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour makes them even healthier.  Per hubby's request, I added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  They turned out great!

1 cup mashed banana = 2 regular bananas. I made some alterations to this recipe per other reviewers suggestions and I still think it needed something more.  I used half white sugar/half brown sugar, added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chip. Next time I will add more cinnamon and vanilla.  The banana, oatmeal and chocolate chips added good texture variety to the muffins, although I may add walnuts or pecans for more.

Made some changes 
1. Used whole wheat flour
2. Substituted vanilla yogurt for the milk.
3. Chucked a handful of chocolate chips into the batter. 

The net result was a moist bread, gently flavored and perfect for breakfast or snacking. It is not cloyingly sweet nor does it go overboard with the banana flavor. If you'd like it sweeter, top with honey. Delicous! Perfect accompaniment to coffee for an afternoon pick-me-up.

After reading many of the reviews, I did make a couple of changes, not something I normally do before I have made the recipe at least once. I substituted applesauce for the oil (cup for cup), I topped these with the topping recipe for the banana oat muffins from Kimberly on this site and I baked them as others suggested - 350 for 25 minutes.
These muffins had a wonderful flavor, great texture and were very moist. I am glad I did substitute the applesauce for the oil (a single serve cup =1/3c). The topping was great, sweet  & crunchy (note to self: try this topping on other muffin recipes!). The only complaint would be that they muffins stuck to the paper liners I used. My co-workers didn't think that was a problem at all - they were just trying to decide if they were better at room temperature or warmed up in the microwave!
Thanks Karen for a great recipe!

As other reviewers suggested, I made a few changes.  I used 1/3 cup applesauce instead of the oil, and used a mixture of white and whole wheat flour (1 cup white/1/2 cup whole wheat.)  I also added raisins and chopped pecans.  Great recipe that freezes well.

Very good recipe though I altered it some.  I changed the oil to cinnamin apple sauce, reduced the temperature to 375 for 20 minutes and made it with 1/4 cup walnuts and a mix of wheat and white flour.  Very tasty.

I'm sorry to say that I found these tasteless.  I added cinnamon, substituted applesauce for the oil, included brown sugar, and used a very ripe banana and the muffins still didn't have enough flavor for my family's tastes.

Pretty tasty but not my favorite. Needs some spices. I added cinnamon and a splash of banana extract for more banana flavor. I also added more banana than called for (make sure to use the darkest bananas you can find...the browner the better. These have the best flavor. Will make again. I am going to try half whole wheat flour next time.

I love these muffins for breakfast.  Like others, I substituted applesauce for the oil.  If you use a non-stick muffin pan, like me, just don't bother with the muffin cups at all.  I add 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. allspice for extra flavor.  The potential add-ins are endless.  I like walnuts, or even chopped apple, slice almonds, coconut... YUM!

These are heaven when they are warm, like your favorite banana bread only fluffier and with a nice "bite" from the oatmeal.  They are also good cold, but the banana flavour is less pronounced.  Very good and not too sweet.

Great muffins - I like that they're not too sweet. It makes me feel better when all my 2-year-old wants to eat in a day is muffins! I also substituted applesauce for the oil, as I often do in breads and muffins. I got 12 regular sized muffins and still had enough batter for 8 minis. Thanks for sharing, Karen!

Absolutely delicious!  I try to rate original recipes and not make changes before rating them but I really wanted a healthy muffin so did the following:  Used applesauce i/o oil and brown i/o white sugar (1:1 exchange), soy i/o cow milk (only drink soy), added 1/2 C.+ chopped nuts and an extra banana (1 C = abt 2 large bananas, mashed).  Wonderful!.  I ran out of muffin liners so did some without and found they were better than the ones w/the liners.  This one will be a regular feature in our household!

This makes a really good muffin - I made it exactly as written, except used half whole wheat, half all-purpose flour.  The texture is really good with the oats, slightly chewy, and it is not too sweet like a lot of muffin recipes.  The only thing lacking, I was thinking, was some spice so next time I make these I will try either cinnamon or cardamom.  With some tweaking, this may become my go-to banana muffin recipe.

This was the worst muffin I have ever made. I followed the advice of some writers and used applesauce instead of oil, so there was a slight change to the recipe. Other than that, I followed the recipe, yet the muffin was bland and had a really bad texture.

These are wonderful! I exchanged the oil for applesauce, added cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, kept the white sugar. The original recipe is a little bland so I added the spices the second time and it is much better. This time I am adding chocolate chips to half and butterscotch chips to half. The hubby thinks they need more texture to them. I will continue to make these because they are so good!

Delicious.  I changed the sugar for Stevia (diabetics) and added some Splenda brown sugar.  Added some cinnamon and frozen blueberries.  Very yummy

Made these as per the recipe. Did not come out very big or rise very much. Kids did not like them...found them a bit dry. I added chocolate chips and they still did not like them. Husband ate them up. Probably will not make again. I found the taste good. Wish they were less dense.

Excellent! I used ERINKR82's advice and substituted egg whites, 1/2 brown sugar and applesauce (for oil). I also added chocolate chips because I was cooking for a crowd. I came home with an empty muffin container and found my recipe to have 
135 calories, 22 Carb, 5 cholesterol each.

Easy to make and quite good, with the addition of 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. The batter actually yielded 18 muffins. I would make this again.

These were pretty good - I make a similar one with blueberries from this site. I used half wheat flour, split the white sugar with some brown but may switch to all brown next time. I also added some yogurt and a little less milk. And of course, to make it less healthy...some chocolate chips.

Good recipe. I substituted applesauce for oil as well, and reduced the sugar just a bit. Used half whole-wheat, and added 1/2 C of diced apples, and 1/2 C of chopped walnuts. Made for tasty, healthy muffins!

Not a super moist muffin but not dried out either.  I made no changes and thought it was pretty good.  Next time I will add nuts or choc chips.

I made this as written for half of the muffins and altered to suit my tastes for the other half (that way I could rate this fairly).  As written this is a very tasty muffin.  I added some chopped pecans to the batter and then topped the muffins with dried banana chips.  My wife (who begged me not to try my hand at what has been historically her domain, baking) loved them.   The real test was the kids, who also loved them (the plain ones).  I also made another batch with some of the recommendations (1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white, 3/4 tsp Baking Powder) and they were great as well.  Foolproof baking if I can make them :o)

These were very good. I did substitute applesauce for the oil. I just don't like that they stick to the paper cups. I was going to just put them in a pan sprayed with cooking spray.  really wish I had done that.

OK, Yum! Even with "healthy" changes (applesauce instead of oil, half white whole wheat flour, half AP flour) these were delish. Added some leftover butterscotch morsels I had on hand and they made them awesome. Actually made more than 12 muffins for me - I had to put some leftover batter in a mini loaf pan.

My preschooler announced that he wanted to make muffins this evening.  Searching through my fridge, I had very few ingredients - but I DID have bananas!  I was initially attracted to this recipe because it called for rolled oats, which makes for a healthier version of a muffin.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than using 1c whole wheat flour and 1/2c ap.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/3 c.  Thanks so much for this recipe - it was quick, easy, healthy, and our whole family loved the end result!!

I have nothing bad to say about this new favorite of mine. It was extremely easy to prepare and baked up beautifully. I just enjoyed one toped with a little strawberry jam and I feel so satisfied. There's no need to change a thing with this recipe. It's perfect! In case anyone wants to know I calculated the calories to be aprox 180 calories per muffin. Worth it! :)

My family loves these muffins.  I usually add chocolate chips and use unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil.  The last time I made these, I made a double batch and froze half of them.  I take a few out of the freezer the night before and have a quick and easy breakfast the next morning for the kids and myself. My 5 year old loves them so much that he takes them for his school snack...of course, I'm sure the addition of the chocolate chips is a big reason for this...

Delicious! I changed just a little bit. I used only 1/2 cup all purpose flour and then 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also added a dash of cinnamon, walnuts and chocolate chips. My 2 year old is gobbling them up, and so am I! They came out perfectly moist. This is a hit in my house!

Great muffins!  I was expecting something more hearty, but these baked up really light and fluffy.  I stuffed mine with nuts, chopped strawberries, and raisins.  They turned out moist and delicious.

These were okay but needed more banana taste and to be a bit sweeter too. I didn't care for the texture the oats gave it, but hubby didn't mention it. Easy to mix up.

These muffins were absolutely perfect! The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white. My kids thought they were delicious, and I love that the oats and banana pack in the nutrition!

These are ten times better than any banana bread I have ever tasted. I did make some adjustments to increase the health factor, and trust me - there was no compromise in taste. I used all WW flour, brown sugar instead of white, unsweetened applesauce in place of oil, and added a dash of cinnamon. Topped them off with a walnut half, and they disappeared from the kitchen.

Excellent!  A muffin that's a true muffin and not a cake.  I like to add a 2/3 Cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  My picky little boy loves them too.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummy muffin!  I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and used 3 bananas (I think it works out to a little bit more than a cup).  I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and dusted the tops with Splenda and cinnamon before baking.  I also added about 1 TBSP of cinnamon to the mix.  20 minutes was perfect and they came out golden and moist.  I am trying to eat low fat and cut some sugar and found that by doing these mild changes the muffins didn't loose their texture.  They were mildly sweet and moist.

This recipe was AWESOME. I loved the texture, moist but light. Many banana muffins I've made come out too wet or dense. I baked these for exactly 20 mins and they're nicely crispy on top--not hard. Only thing I added is walnuts, which I think is a must.

These are fantastic! I used 1/2 whole wheat and half white flour, almond milk instead of regular milk and a handful of chopped almonds. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent.  The only reason I didn't rate these 5 stars is I made minor adjustments:  I used less oil and added 2 tablespoons of applesauce.  And I used 3 bananas, which is probably more than a cup.  Other than that, followed the recipe.  The results were beautiful, nutritious, and DELICIOUS muffins.

I tweet this a little...but it was still delicious! 1) I sifted the rolled oats and added walnuts...2) I used 2 cups of All-Bran cereal and let that soak in the milk...3) I used 3 med. sized bananas and 2 eggs...4) I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar...5) to not have that baking soda taste...sift all the dry ingredients together and add to wet ingredients..6) added tsp. vanilla, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg (Love the spices!)and last but not least...I sprayed the muffin pans/paper cups and then sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon. I made 24 mid-sized muffins. Next time I'll use granny smith apple chunks and cinnamon applesauce instead of bananas and oil. Delicious!

I added 1 1/4 cups oats. I added some brown sugar and pecans on top of some.  Others I put just a little brown sugar on top.  Some I made plain (no topping).

Great recipe! I made it just as the recipe says but in a mini muffin pan (aprox 12 minsto cook) also I added a liberal amount of cinnamon, a sprinkle of ginger and about 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips. My 3 year old loves them & so does our teen! Oh yes, I also used Paneriso egg replacer because my 3 year old is allergic to eggs. They turned out great.

YUMM!!! I made these extra healthy to meet the dietary needs of a friend. Replaced oil with equal amount of unsweetened apple sauce. Used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. white flour, and replaced honey with about 1/4 c. honey. I also added about 1/3 c. golden raisins These were not very sweet muffins (obviously) but were delicious, and VERY healthy!

I was looking for a healthier recipe to use up some ripe bananas and decided to go for one with oats. I modified some of the ingredients based on reviewer comments (substituted Splenda brown sugar for half of the sugar called for; used applesauce instead of veg. oil; halved the salt). I also made some additions, stirring in some chia seeds with the flour mix for omega-3 and folding in chopped dates at the end. I ended up with 17 muffins. Great as an afternoon snack, evening sweet or quick breakfast.

These were great! I will definitely be making them again. As suggested by others, I subbed apple sauce for oil, used whole wheat flour and half brown sugar. I added chopped walnuts and spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. I also put a dried banana chip on the top of each muffin half way through the baking.

These are really good muffins. The only changes I made were that I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour and brown sugar in place of white sugar.  I also added blueberries.  Will definitely make again.

These are moist and flavourful muffins.  I added 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Instead of all white flour, I used 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.

Mmm... Moist, delicious. I added half the banana last so I had some nice banana blobs, otherwise followed directions exactly. I always freeze over-ripe bananas for banana bread but this may be all arround better and easier! Except maybe if I am craving a toasted banana bread. Did you know that the smell of banana bread is the number one aphrodisiac for women? My house still smells wonderful! Oh I also got 20 muffins out of this recipe, but they weren't overflowing the cups.

Great muffins, easy recipe. My family loves them, thanks! :) PS: They taste even better after a couple of days, that is, if they last that long. Update: This is a great base recipe for fruit and oatmeal muffins, I tried using this with 1cup grated apple instead of the banana, and added some cinnamon to compliment the apple (about 1/2 tsp, maybe more) and they came out great!

Perfect hearty breakfast muffin, with just one change- whole wheat flour.  I debated leaving in a bit of the all-purpose flour, but then decided to make these muffins completely whole-grain.  They were delicious; moist and yummy!  Great healthy breakfast muffin!

These muffins are quite tasty. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup because the bananas I had were quite ripe and I didn't want it to be too sweet. Right before popping these into the oven, I added a crumb topping consisiting of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon and butter. This made the presentation and the taste of the muffin great! My only concern was that it tasted too much like the baking soda, but I probably just overdid it with that. Overall, great recipe to keep when you want to make banana muffins from scratch.

These are good.  I am giving them a 5 because of their nutrition in comparison to taste.  They taste sort of nutty because of the oats.  I usually feel that when you supplement ingredients for healthier ones, the taste suffers.  I supplemented applesauce for the oil and used part wheat flour instead of regular. I don't know how these would have tasted but they still tasted good...(but obviously healthier.) I added cinnamon and nutmeg and made these into mini muffins and they were great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent muffins...DS really enjoyed them.  A bit too moist (oily?), thus the 4 stars.  Next time, I'll reduce the oil and add applesauce.

Finally...a banana muffin that's perfect !!!  I made a couple of modifications.  I only had one banana so I made up for it with adding applesause.  I substituted applesauce for the oil.  I also added some chopped walnuts and coconut.  Extremely wonderful muffins that baked up perfectly !!!

These muffins were very moist and good.  I changed the recipe just a little to make them more heart healthy. I used 1/3 cup applesauce instead of the oil,reduced sugar to 1/4 cup and used 1% milk. I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 2oz. pkg of chopped walnuts for extra flavor.  These are good warm with a little butter and some honey drizzled on them.

These were very good. They weren't too sweet, which I like, and they are lower on fat than some. I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat for 1 cup of the flour and they turned out great. I baked them at 350 for about 15-18 minutes.

I think these muffins are delicious. I like oatmeal but sometimes find its taste can overpower a muffin, honestly it doesn't here. These are easily the best oatmeal type muffins I have ever had. I add an extra banana because I love that banana flavour. Thanks for sharing karen.

I loved these muffins.  They turned out really light and fluffy.  I baked these before reading the reviews and did have to turn my oven down because they got done on the outside before the inside. I thought it was just my oven. But otherwise the recipe was really good!

I really liked these muffins. I made them just the way the recipe said and when they were done, I just spread a tiny bit of margarine on one of them and it tasted great. I would eat them without the margarine also because they had a wonderful banana flavor. I can't wait to eat more!!

I make these on a regular basis to have on hand in the freezer for an on-the-go breakfast.  To make them a bit healthier, I use whole wheat pastry flour (more fiber) and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (omega 3.)  Next time I'll substitute half of the oil with applesauce to lower the fat content a bit (since I've increased the fat calories because of the walnuts.) Thanks for a great recipe, Karen.

These muffins were great with just a few variations.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  Substituted applesauce for the oil, also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2tsp of almond extract. I will definitely make these muffins again!!!

Nice texture, but bland.  Subs:  1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of 1/2 cup all-purpose & applesauce in place of oil.  Those shouldn't have really altered the taste.  Next time I may add some nuts and cinnamon.

Its a great breakfast muffin except I made a few healthy changes.  Exchanged 1/2 cup wheat flour for the white, 1/2 C splenda and 1/2 C brown sugar instead of sugar .  Applesauce for oil.  Sprinkled with cinn. & splenda.  Very good and only about 110 cals per muffin.

'Doubled the recipe with these amounts:  3c flour, 1/2t cinnamon, 2c oats, 2/3c sugar, 4tsp powder, 2tsp soda, 1tsp salt, 2 eggs, 1 1/2c milk, 1/2c oil, 1tsp vanilla, 2c banana.  They were good, but I think brown sugar would improve the flavor. 3/13 Trying (double still) w 3T melted butter then adding remaining oil to equal 1/2.  4 bananas were 1 1/2c so added 1/2c applesauce.  Used 1c wheat flour, 2 white.  1/3c white, 1/3c brown sugars.  Forgot the cinnamon so put 1/2t in 1T white sugar & sprinkled on top before baking.  Downside: These are one of the muff recipes that you have to wait until cooled to have, if you use liners.  They stick until cooled.  Sigh!  ;D Good, moist, 'think you need 3/4c sugar or the full 2c bananas (not 1/2c applesauce filler) to have them sweet enough.  2/3 isn't unedible, but that little extra sweetness they'll be eaten.

I'm not the biggest banana/nut fan but had the
ripe bananas and the reviews sounded good.  Glad
I tried these!  I followed the suggestions to use
l/2 whole wheat flour, l/2 brown sugar, applesauce instead of oil, soy milk, l t. cinnamon, l/2 t. nutmeg, and walnuts.  Used a 
topping of brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, Benecol
spread,  and wheat germ for some extra crunch.  If my family finds out how healthy these are, they will never touch them:-)  Will go great with
a smoothie in the morning!

These are excellent!  I love the texture and the sweetness level was perfect, imo.  I made them as written except used quick oats instead of rolled (all I had).  I added some chocolate chips at the Hubs request.  I will definitely make these again.

8-22-2018 ~These muffins are tender, sweet and moist, with the added rustic taste and texture of the oatmeal.  You just can’t ask for a better banana muffin. Could it be… that oil rather than butter was at least partially responsible?  I found no sacrifice of flavor because of it! I “gilded the lily” with a streusel topping (King Arthur) which even added to their appeal.

This recipe was great and definitely fool(me)-proof!  I only had one banana so I added 1/2 contain (~3.5oz) plain full fat greek yogurt to the batter.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup as I prefer a less sweet muffin.  Followed the recipe for the rest of the ingredients.  The muffin came out with a crusty exterior and a bouncy moist interior.  I will definitely make again!

These were good but ONLY if I baked them for less than the recommended time. For me, 15 was plenty. Don't know if that's because of changes I made -- subbed in whole wheat flour for half of the flour and added a bit of ground flax.

These muffins have the perfect amount of sweetness. I also added a cup of chopped walnuts and they came out delicious! So quick and easy to make too!

I was looking for a banana anything recipe that called for oatmeal. I had a few Quaker Oats regular (plain) oatmeal packets that no one in my house eats (they were part of a variety pack). So I used them here! Made the recipe exactly as instructed with the exception of adding chocolate chips. They're deliciously moist and tasty.  Yum! Will definitely make them again!

I changed the recipe some to make it a bit healthier. I omitted 1/4 C of flour & used 1/4 C of flax seed meal instead. I also added frozen blueberries coated in flour. I accidentally forgot the baking soda but they came out fine. I got 12 medium & 12 mini muffins from the batch.

I  have made this recipe many times- following the recipe exactly as written and substituing flours, sugars & milk.  A favorite healthy version for us is 1/2 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup kamut flour - 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/4 cup applesauce.  Always comes out moist and delicious.

NO SUBSTITUTIONS. These are sweet, fluffy, and have a beautiful domed top! Even with the oatmeal they're not super dense, and you can definitely taste the banana all the way through.

I love these muffins.  I love nuts, so always add about a cup of chopped English walnuts.  Sometimes I use half regular flour and half whole wheat flour.  However I make them, they are great.  My favorite breakfast with coffee!!

I think these would benefit from some brown sugar, maybe half and half with white sugar?  Also some cinnamon wouldn't hurt.  I used two bananas.  The texture was good.

I really think these are a nice morning breaky substitue; they are substantial enough to make you feel like you are really eating a meal. I used 1/4 c brown sugar splenda instead of the white sugar....next time I'm using applesauce.

These are fantastic and moist.  I modified them to accommodate my son's dairy/milk and egg allergies, as well as make them a tad more healthy.  For those of you who are in the same boat, try this:   1 c regular flour + 1/2 cup wheat flour, 1/4 brown sugar + 1/4 c Splenda, (1.5 T oil+1.5T water+1tsp baking powder whisked together) - this is your 1 egg substitute; 3/4 c soy milk instead of milk, 1/3 c applesauce instead of oil, 1 tsp vanilla instead of 1/2 t, and a 1/2 cup dairy-free choc chips in addition to the bananas bc YUM!

Ok for breakfast - not too sweet. If you substitute applesauce for the oil like I did, be sure to spray your pan/cupcake papers. Mine were very difficult to peel away from the wrappers.

UPDATE: I froze about half of these after being less than excited about them. Pulled them out of the freezer the other day to try them again. TOASTED, AND TOPPED WITH NUTELLA, these were sooo much better! Granted, that probably takes away some of the "healthy" factor, but they were delicious.

Ok, these muffins are perfect! Like most others, I made slight adjustments. I swapped the flour and oat measurements, using more oats than flour.  I also used wheat flour instead of regular.  I cooked them for 20 minutes and they turned out perfectly.  Mama and kid approved!

I made a double batch of the mixture because I had a lot of bananas to use up. For the first 12 muffins, I followed the recipe exactly. I found them to be less flavorful than I prefer and a bit dry. I had some dried cranberries (about 3/4 c.) left over from the holidays and added that along with a tablespoon of butter to the second batch. They were fantastic! The cranberries added a lot of sweetness and the butter made them more savory.

Was a pretty good muffin! I followed the recipe exactly but used whole wheat flour bc I didn't have any white flour. Next time I'll try to cut out the oil by using applesauce or butter. Other than that the only changes I'll make is by adding fun things like chocolate chips, raisins and blueberries. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Everyone in my family loved these, even my very pick 11-year old.  In fact, he said that he gives them 4.99 stars - he would have given them 5 stars if I had made them bigger. :)

Really enjoyed these muffins. Not too sweet and nice texture. Also I like the yield, I got 12 standard size muffins that were just slightly larger than the cups, no giant muffin tops. I made the recipe as is except added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. I used 4 small bananas. The recipe is good as is and would be a great base recipe for many variations (ie adding spice, switching fruit) Will bake again soon... maybe with carrot instead of banana?

These are good! I substituted applesauce for the oil like many other reviewers and used half brown sugar half white sugar. I also added chocolate chips and Craisins for extra yum :) My one comment is DO NOT PUT IN PAPER LINERS! I used paper liners as the recipe suggested and half the muffin is still on the paper! I'd suggest just spraying your muffin pan with oil

Didn't use liners instead sprayed pan with baking spray and that gave the edges of the muffins a crispier texture. Used a browned butter glaze on top of the muffins and they turned out delicious. The whole family loves them.

Made these GF with 1/2 c each: corn flour, almond flour & coconut flour. Used Safflower oil, added additional banana & used raw honey in place of cane sugar. I also spiced this recipe up a little with the addition of cinnamon and ground cardamom. To some of the muffins, I also added chopped walnuts for crunch. Since my youngest is sensitive to tree nuts - I left a majority of the muffins tree nut free. Being moist was not an issue with my variation; just let them cool in the tins before removing them.

I really liked this recipe but I tweaked it quite a bit so I hesitate to give the original 5 stars.  I changed white flour to whole wheat for health benefits and used brown sugar instead of white and added an extra egg per other reviewers' suggestions.  I also added chocolate chips which makes it less healthy and more delicious.  With the eggs and chocolate added, the recipe made 18 muffins.   Will definitely make again.

Made it more healthy - Changed it up a bit due to a milk allergy - no milk but added 2 applesauce snack cups unsweetened, also added more oil - 1/2 cup in total. Whole wheat flour instead of white. and only 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of a 1/2 cup white. Turned out amazing, moist and sweet.

Made it the day before yesterday and didn't have baking soda so I doubled the baking powder....they came out sooo good! They got finished that night so I made a second batch yesterday (after buying the baking soda) just to realize we were out of eggs! I added an extra 1/2 cup of mashed banana to replace the egg and they still came out so delicious and moist. All in all, the best banana oat recipe I've ever had!

Made these EXACTLY as written and they were very good. It made 12 light and moist muffins that raised just right. What I really liked is that they don't call for anything you don't have on hand, and are SO fast and easy. They taste better if you let them cool several hours before enjoying-not as good right out of the oven, because we could taste the baking soda and baking powder when they were hot. We make these regularly, and you can add other things like nuts and raisins or CHOCOLATE CHIPS! Update June 2019 -Got a sectioned brownie pan ( like a muffin pan), and it yielded 16 little cakes. I baked them for less time 16-18 at same temp.

These were okay, but needed a bit of spice... Cinnamon and nutmeg.  Also the reviews were correct about needing to spray the paper liner, they stick quite a bit.

Great for breakfast. I did what everyone else did and subbed applesauce for oil, white whole wheat flour for white (half and half), threw in a half a cup of chopped walnuts, and 3 tbls of chia seeds and 2 tbl of flax meal for fiber and omega 3. Always perfect!

The muffins baked up beautifully and were moist, however,they were lacking in depth of flavor and the oats were a little  chewy.  I would not make this recipe again as is. I might try it again substituting buttermilk and soaking the oats first.

I could taste the baking powder in the final product, which I didn't like. I also would have liked a tad bit more sugar. I may frost what's left just to perk it up a bit.

This is good IF you add spices and/or nuts. I first made them as is, and they were very bland.  The next time I added 1.5 t cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, and pecans and they were good. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar as suggested in other reviews. Also as mentioned in other reviews- these bake much faster than recipe states.  Mine were done in 15 minutes, any longer and they would have been really dry.

came out pretty good, a little spongy but I'll probably make it again.  I followed some of the advice given and used applesauce instead of oil, added about 1/2 cup of chopped almonds, and I also used brown sugar instead of white.

Loved the golden brown color the muffins were when taking them out of the oven after 18 minutes. Just beautiful. They had good banana flavor and were moist. I even added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. Kids loved them!
Would make again.

This is a good recipe, with simple on hand ingredients.  I doubled the recipe since I had four bananas to put to good use (btw four medium bananas gave me two cups which worked perfectly).  The only thing  I did differently to alter the taste was was add about a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts since we like banana nut bread, and I baked it in a 9x13" pan for 43 minutes at 350 degrees  because I didn't want to bother with the tins.  Moist and hearty but not grainy like I expected (good thing with a teenager in the house).  I would make again, thanks for sharing!

I changed this to jack up the health factor. I switched flour for whole wheat flour, 1 c of white sugar for 1/4 c brown sugar, oil for applesauce, egg for 2 egg whites, milk for skim milk + one scoop of vanilla whey protein powder, vanilla for Mexican vanilla, and added 2 T of ground flaxseeds and 3/4 c chopped walnuts. You might think they'd be way off or gross right? Well they were mind blowingly good! I will make them again just that way! Oh yeah, I also couldn't find my muffin tin so I baked it in a 9x9 pyrex pan. Took about 22 mins and was golden brown and crunchy on top and soft and moist in the middle! YUM!

THIS IS DELICIOUS!!! I did make a couple changes...I added about a 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips as well as a 1/2 cup of sweetend coconut, so AMAZING. Love nuts but not so much in my food but could imagine adding them would be great also. Oh and instead of muffins I made a loaf baked at 350 for 45 mins. After slicing the loaf I sprinkled it lightly with powder sugar. Will be making this to send to my love over in Iraq. :-)

Da bomb!!  Picky kids gobbled them up, and had no idea that I used Greek vanilla yogurt instead of milk, and part applesauce for the oil.  To further the illusion of yummyness, I sprinkled mini chocolate chips on the top.

These are the best! They don't last long! I substitute half of the flour for whole wheat, and use an egg substitute. I also add cinnamon. I also let the batter sit for awhile to soften up the oatmeal. Yummy!!!

These were pretty good - I loved the texture of them, but thought they needed more sweetness and the banana flavor wasn't really there fresh out of the oven. I'm sure it will develop a little as they sit though. I would definitely add another 1/4 cup sugar next time, probably brown sugar.

I was very happy with these. I subbed applesauce and made 1/2 wheat flour as others suggested. They came out plenty moist and fluffy.  I also added a 1/2 tsp. almond extract and 2 T. ground flaxseed for fiber. (Next time I want to try all wheat flour and sour the milk to add some fluff.I'll update when I try it.)

These were a hit with our homeschool group. I modified the recipe to make it healthier. I wasn't sure if the kids would like them or not, but they loved them! I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour. I substituted applesauce for oil and almond milk for milk (dairy allergy in my house). I used half sugar and half Truvia. I also added walnuts.

Yummy!  I followed suggestions to use an extra egg which added some nice moisture since I used all whole wheat flour. I also added some cinnamon. Absolutely delicious. I'll make this recipe for years to come.

Great basic recipe! So easy to modify. I sub'd applesauce for oil, used an egg plus an egg white, a heaping cup of mashed bananas, white wheat flour, and added about a half a cup each of semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts. They were wonderful! I also didn't use baking cups, I just used a non-stick spray and a non-stick muffin pan. Will definitely be making these again!!

I changed a couple of things, I used 1 cup wholemeal flour, 0.5 cup of plain flour. I also used ~1/4 cup brown sugar and it came out plenty sweet and very moist.
Delicious, will make again.

Very good!  Easy to mix with ingredients on hand.  Threw in a handful of chopped walnuts and dark chocolate chips and a dash of cinnamon. Used 3 medium bananas.  Used potato mashed to mash bananas.  Will make again!

These are great. I am gluten free so I had to sub gluten-free flour (plus xantham gum) and gluten-free oats.  I made them mini muffins. And the non gluten-free fiancee liked 'em just fine, too.

Great, flavorful muffins. I split the flour into half bread flour and half wheat...turned out perfectly. The oats add a welcome bit of texture. My family loved these!

I found these muffins kind of bland, not too much flavour. They need more banana, maybe 1-1/2c. and some spices. Next time I will also try brown sugar to add another hit of flavour. I used half whole wheat flour as other reviews suggested. I think that with my modifications these muffins will be 4 or (do I dare say) 5 stars!

So good! My 4, 2 and almost 1 year loved these, and so did I. I used 3/4 C of King Arthur white whole wheat flour and 3/4C of King Arthur Unbleached White. Looking forward to making these yummy muffins again.

I would have given this 5 stars but it definitely has a baking soda aftertaste.  I made it again without the baking soda and it was fantastic! I also like to use 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour, as well as 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Fantastic recipe!

I used 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 all-purpose flour. I also substituted brown sugar for the white.  If I had some walnuts I would have thrown those in too. Thanks for a great recipe!  I will be making these again!

We had guests over and everyone loved them! They were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside! Will be making them often...yay!

Very good taste and texture.  I added walnuts to half of the muffins.  They all cooked in sprayed cupcake papers (bottom only) and did not stick.  I wonder if carrots and raisins could be added instead of bananas just to change it up?

This is a great base recipe to start with.  I used 1 cup AP flour and a 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup whit sugar and 1/4 cup brown, 3/4 cups fruit juice (instead of milk, I bought Fruitables juice and my kids didn't like it, so I snuck it into the muffins), and I left out the vanilla because I didn't have any left.  Other then that, the ingredients were the same.  Came out GREAT!!!!

Fantastic!  Very nice, very moist, very good.  Everyone loved them.  I mixed a little crumble topping of brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and flour and sprinkled on top, don't know that I would do that next time, they didn't need it and it sunk into the dough too much and cratered.  These are really good and I will definitely make these again and again.

Very nice and easy recipe. Great way to use thos over ripe bananas.  They kept fresh for almost 4 days (put them in a toaster over for a few minutes to get a crunchy top). Nice and not too sweet.

Per the suggestions of other reviewers, I made these with half whole-wheat flour and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, (2T white and 2T brown).  The muffins turned out great!  Will definitely make again.

These muffins are great! I used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour for some of the flour,  applesauce in place of the oil, and added some walnuts. Delicious.

Love them!  I used natural applesauce instead of oil, 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup white, added a sprinkle of flax seed and about 1/8 cup of wheat germ.  Oh, and I added about 1 1/2 cup of banana and a chocolate chips.  Baked at 375 for 18 minutes.  Yummy!

Good, basic recipe.  Only change I made was to add a little cinnamon.  If I make this again I think I'll use melted butter instead of oil, though, because it seemed to lack richness.  This made a lot of batter and I filled each cup to the rim, but they didn't rise too much so it wasn't a problem.

I just made this in order for my son to have something a little healthier for snack time. I followed the recipe exactly, other using a loaf pan because, well, I don't have muffin tins. The flavor was good but I do agree that it could use nuts. But it has a good banana flavor that isn't too sweet.  If you do use the cake pan I would cut the temp. back to 375 degrees and up the time to 25-35 minutes.

If you don't use the oil you definitely need to spray the muffin liners, mine are stuck to the paper! They are pretty good but I think I might add some chocolate chips next time to sweeten them up a bit.

Just what I was looking for - the oatmeal seems to add the needed texture for a "lighter" muffin. I used 1/4 plain nonfat yogurt and a couple tablespoons of softened butter. I had three bananas I needed use and I did take the suggestion to use brown sugar in place of the white. I also used 1/2c. whole wheat flour and 1c. all purpose flour.

I baked this into a breadpan for an hour, but I think that this recipe isn't phenomenal.  I recommend making both bread and muffins using the recipe Emily's Famous Banana Oat Muffins.  That recipe created more moist muffins and bread with a better taste.

I made alterations to this recipe. First, I used half white flour, half whole wheat. I added a little more than 1 cup mashed banana. Before I started the muffins, I chopped 1 cup fresh strawberries and tossed them with a pinch brown sugar. I stirred them in last. I also tossed some oatmeal and brown sugar together to sprinkle over muffins before baking.

These turned out really well. I put mostly applesauce and a little bit of oil too.  I also put 1 tsp. vanilla instead of 1/2 and put a lot of cinnamon (didn't measure...maybe like 1 or 2 tbsp?).  Also put 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar, and 2 bananas.  Will make again!

This recipe is a keeper.   I used mini muffin pans and sprayed them first, then baked at 400* for 10 minutes.  I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of ground nutmeg - they were great.

Followed the directions for the muffin batter exactly. Added a crumble topping (1 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 Tbsp white sugar, 1/2 Tbsp flour and 1 Tbsp butter mixed together and sprinkled over the top of the 12 muffins). They are absolutely delicious. Highly recommend!

These are so delicious and healthy!  I eat one for breakfast every day!  I use a mix of oats, barley, and rye. I also put 1/4 C white and 1/4 C brown sugar.  1/4 C of ground flax meal too.  I use cinnamon apple sauce in place of the oil.  I also add cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the batter. My favorite spices.  I'm going to try making it with pumpkin today in place of the bananas.  Thanks!

Very moist and delicious. I also made a few adjustments - 1 cup all purpose flour 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, the suggested 1/2 brown sugar, 2 tsp toasted wheat germ and they tasted great.  I agree these muffins could use nuts, so I will try that next time.

I'm auditioning muffins for Thanksgiving and these passed my test.  I substituted 1/2 cup ww flour for all-purpose and added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts.  Husband says they smelled better than they taste, but he wrong!  They are great.

Great muffin recipe.  Baked twice with minor changes, subbed half the AP flour with whole wheat, decreased the sugar slightly, added mini chocolate chips and some walnuts and baked in mini tins at 395 for 10 minutes.  I have two happy little girls!

Lovely, tender muffins!!  I loved the slight "hint" of oatmeal flavor and the oatmeal gave it a wonderful, light chew.  They were not overly sweet, which I really appreciate.  I could see substituting brown sugar for some or all of the white sugar called for; that would be a great taste.  Overall, excellent muffins that will stay in my muffin rotation!  Thank you for sharing, Karen

This muffins were great...with some modifications. I used 1 cup wheat and 1/2 cup AP flour. I also subbed the oil for unsweetened applesauce and added 1 full tsp of vanilla. Finally, I added an oat crumble topping (1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup oats, 1/2 cup AP flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon) to the top. These are healthy and great! Not too sweet either.

We loved these.  Like a lot of others, I used half whole wheat flour and half white and substituted applesauce for the oil.  They taste very yummy, have great texture, and look beautiful.

8/5/2010--I've made these a gazillion times (usually adding chocolate chips) and we just can't get enough.  Today I also added walnuts and the muffins taste so much like Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey ice cream that we are now calling these Chunky Monkey Muffins.  So tasty!

Very good, they aren't very sweet so if you like muffins that are sweeter you may want to add some sugar.  I added chocolate chips and walnuts and they tasted like and oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, muffin style.

great and easy. I doubled the recipe, used half white and half brown sugar, replaced some of the white flour with ground flax seeds, added a handful of raisins and a handful of 7grain cereal and finally I added a strawberry to the center of each one and a small piece on top.  Top notch!

Super delicious!!  I too used 1/2 whole wheat flower and 1/2 white flour, applesauce in place of oil, and next time will try the 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  These are scrumptious!

I thought these turned out great! I used a mini muffin pan which yielded about 30 muffins and adjusted the cooking time to about 10 minutes. I also added a little extra banana and flax, which helped me cut down the oil to only 1 Tablespoon. Still very moist that way.

These are awesome, and so much better (and healthier) than regular banana bread. We typically add mini chocolate chips, and substitute applesauce for the oil.

Awesome muffins! I used half white and half brown sugar, and added a tsp of cinnamon. The muffins turned out really good! I'll try using whole wheat flour next time. Thanks for recipe!

I'm giving this a 5 because even though I modified some of the recipe...I have never been able to make a decent muffin until now.  These are so good, moist and really flavorful.. I added cinnamon and used half wheat flour/half white and half brown/half white sugar. They rose nicely and did not stick to the pan at all.  Thanks so much for making me a muffin baker!

Wonderful great little muffins.  I also used applesauce instead of oil and I also added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. The only problem I had was the paper sticking to the muffin.

I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour; 1/4 cup unsalted butter with 2 tbsp. apple sauce INSTEAD of the oil (ran out of canola oil); added 1/2 cup of mini-chocolate chips; added 1/2 cup chopped pecan pieces -- which gave them the perfect touch of crunch -- these were simply the best!

Followed muffin recipe but used all whole wheat flour instead of white.  I also added a crumble topping (1 Tbsp butter cut into 1 Tbsp Whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon).  They were amazing!!!  I will make again with applesauce instead of oil to see if they turn out the same.

I added cinnamon and allspice and substituted half the sugar with honey.  They browned very fast in my oven, so I reduced the temperature to 325 for the same baking length.

Delicious muffins - subbed applesauce for the oil, used half whole wheat/half white flour, and half brown/half white sugar.  Sometimes I add 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.

Pretty good flavor and texture.  Not too sweet, which I appreciated.  A tiny bit of streusel topping helps these feel more like a treat.

These are going to be a staple here. I have made several batches already, varying things each time. I now use all whole wheat flour (reduce amount slightly if you do this) and reduced sugar and oil by half. I add ground flax seed, and increase the mashed banana or replace the missing oil with applesauce. Each batch is perfect, you can't mess them up! DO SPRAY MUFFIN LINERS first>

These are great! I did as some others did and made them a little healthier. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour. I split the sugar into half brown / half white. I split the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  I had the oven at 350 without realizing it and they came out just fine in about 22 minutes. Even with all the 'healthy stuff' I thought this recipe made were a very tasty and moist muffin. I will definitely be making these again.

Delicious, moist, and healthy muffins! Instead of the oil, I added an apple that I tossed into the blender. I also threw in a cup of dried blueberries. They were barely out of the oven and I was already halfway through them. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great base recipe. Used half whole wheat, half white flour. Used brown sugar instead of white. Used soy milk instead of cow's. I didn't have enough bananas, so I used apple sauce to get up to a cup of fruit. I then also tossed in a few other things I wanted my daughter to eat :), like some wheat germ and some quinoa cereal that had dried fruit in it. All worked like a charm - they were great! My husband and I ate way more than my daughter!

I add a scoop of vanilla protein powder to my flour cup and use the remainder of the cup for flour - it adds protein and doesn't not impact texture or flavor in any way

I have said it about banana muffins from this site before but these are my new favorite muffins! I believe its the addition of milk that makes them but they are fantastic. I made no real changes but I did add chocolate chips & shredded coconut (which is a tip from my other favorite receipe on this site). Next time I will make sure that I have applesauce to add for part of the oil but these are great as is... I plan to make these many more times.

I replaced the oil with applesauce. I had never tried that before but it changes the texture a little (a bit chewy/gummy), so next time I might use oil, depending on who I'm baking for. Otherwise it's not bad... I also put in a pinch of cinnamon. A good yet healthy muffin is hard to find - thanks!

I doubled the recipe.  The changes I made were in temperature and time, applesauce for oil, added cinnamon, brown sugar for white sugar, and added flaxseed.  The muffins were good but not as sweet as I would have liked.  Maybe if my bananas had been a bit more ripe they would have been more to my liking.  However my husband will love them just the way they are!

So yummy and SO easy! I was easily able to whip these up one morning before everyone was awake (a rarity). The thing we all loved about them was that they weren't overly sweet - but definitely sweet enough! Fantastic texture with the oats. Thank you!!!

Good and good for you.  I used way more banana than the recipe called for, maybe four big bananas.  I used brown sugar instead of white and nearly half of a cup of applesauce instead of oil.  I cut the baking powder to 1 1/2 t and increased the vanilla to 1 t.  I made this as muffins and mini muffins, just sprayed some Pam in the tins and filled the tins 3/4 full.  No spill over at all.  I hate to admit how many of these we've eaten.

Excellent recipe! I've made these now several times, and they just keep getting better and better. I also reduced the veg oil to 1/4 cup and added a 1/4 cup of applesauce - yummy!

I used whole wheat flour. 1/2 cup applesauce + 1 tbs of oil. 1/2 brn and white sugar. Only 1 tsp of baking powder could taste it when I used 2. This last time I added blueberries and talk about good! Very healthy and light snack for those who are trying to eat healthy.

The muffins turned out okay, but not fabulously. I think 400 degrees is too hot. I would do 375 or 350. Also, I think the recipe calls for too much baking powder/soda, leaving a bit of a bitter aftertaste.

These were delicious!I made a couple of modifications after read a few reviews. I added the crumb topping from the "Banana Crumb Muffins" recipe.I used 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 white flour, applesauce instead of oil, substituted brown sugar for white,  substituted vanilla yogurt for milk and and 3 tablespoon of chopped walnuts for extra flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!

Great balance of sweet and salty here!  I added the crumb topping from the "Banana Crumb Muffins" recipe.  In general, the banana flavor isn't overwhelming yet you can smell it in the muffins.  Actually, the whole house smelled pretty amazing.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Just made my second batch (doubled both times) and they look great!  I've done 1/2 oil/applesauce - you can tell, as always, but they're still good.  I've also fancied them up w/ ch. chips, raisins, shredded coconut.  This batch I filled the cups about 90% full; NO spilling over with the rise they're getting in my oven.  I’m using 375* ~20 min. with dark non-stick muffin tins.  By the way, these tins are SUPER (Calphalon Classic – Bed,Bath&Beyond)!  I never use paper liners.  After the muffins cool a bit, I shake the pans side to side w/ a little force to loosen the muffins from the walls of the cups.  They come right out easily once slightly warm, even w/ decreased oil.  Clean-up’s easy b/c of the non-stick.  Not having liners makes for a pretty presentation in a cloth-napkin-lined basket.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I added mini chocolate chips and a cinnamon sugar sprinkle on top.  I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and baked at 350 in my convection oven for 17 minutes and they came out great!

I made these a few days ago and I was skeptical when I first pulled them out of the oven. They seemed a little too dry, and fluffier than I like my muffins. But when I let them cool down, they were really good! The flavor was unique because of the rolled oats. And the texture was slightly chewy, and became nice and moist after cooling a bit. Great breakfast muffin! Hearty enough to be eaten alone, or if you're really hungry, served along with eggs, juice, fruit and the rest of your morning spread.

These are very good, make sure when you bake them, they turn nice and dark brown, that way they are really good.  Chopped nuts always give them a nice flavour as well!

i absolutely love this recipe.  all other banana muffins/breads come out dense and uncooked in the middle, but these muffins came out PERFECT.  i replaced most of the oil with applesauce and added 1/8 teaspoon ginger which made it taste "autumn-y."  this recipe is highly recommended!!

I used a mini muffin pan instead and got 27 tiny (but high-domed) muffins! they were delicious and moist! but i had to bake them for 18 min so maybe you have to bake them longer if you are using regular sized pans. or maybe its just my oven i dont know. ok i also substituted 1/3c unsweetened applesauce for the oil to make the muffins healthier, and used "no sugar added" soymilk which was pretty tasteless and yucky on its own but it worked well in the muffins i guess. i thought the oats were a little too overpowering though so i will cut it down to half a cup next time i make this. yes i will definitely be making this again! some thought the muffins were not sweet enough but i think it was just right for me :)

Good and easy!  I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar before baking.  I think next time I will use quick oats instead of rolled oats (a little too chewy).  But all in all, a great recipe.

Awesome recipe :)  Because I had to make these before my brother ate all the bananas, the ones I used weren't completely ripe, and I used brown granulated sugar instead of white sugar.  As a result, they weren't quite as sweet, but still very good.  Nice and healthy.

I'm afraid I'm a bit of a "tweaker" so made a few adjustments, & maybe upped the "healthiness"?? Used 1 1/4c whole wheat flour, 1/4c splenda, 3/4c low fat vanilla soy milk, 1/3c unsweetened applesauce for oil, & added 1 tsp cinnamon. Then used fiber powder, vanilla protein powder & ground flax to make up the 1/4c of flour I'd omitted. Thanks Karen, for an excellent health concious recipe, suitable to adjust as you please! The muffins were delicious, the perfect boost with my morning smoothie!:)
(One thing I'd love to know, if anyone can answer, does baking with protein powder really take all the goodness out of it? Some say yes, some say no, & I've yet to find a straight proven answer.) Thanks for any info!

Next time I'll make mini muffins. This muffin is way too dense and heavy for regular sized muffins. I think I'll add less oats and a tad more sugar. I added raisins andI think that's what rally made the muffins. I will try this recipe again with my changes.

These muffins were delicious.  I initially made them for my one-year-old son, but they smelled so good my husband and I had to try them ourselves.  I was so surprised how delicious they were with so little sugar!  Many of the other recipes I looked at had up to 2 cups!  I made the following changes:  used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 white, and used half oil, half applesauce. They also freeze really well - just pop in the microwave for an easy breakfast!

This is a great recipe.  I make them entirely with whole wheat, added 1-2 tsp of cinnamon, and sprinkled some chocolate chips on the tops of them to make them a little extra exciting for the kids.

They lasted one day at our house, and were gone - the whole family loved them.

Will definitely make again.

This recipe came out really yummy with a little tweeking.  I used brown sugar instead of white and I added 1/2 tbsp. cinnamon. I ommitted the vanilla because I ran out of it. I sprinkled the tops with brown sugar and cinnamon. I also baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  The came out perfectly.  They were moist and delicious. My two year old triplets loved them and kept yelling "MORE!"

These were good but as others stated a little bland. I used olive oil and added 2tsp. honey. I would make them again adjusting accordingly.

These turned out pretty good overall.  I changed some things up based off of the reviews.  I decreased the oil to 1/4 cup, added 1/2 cup of applesauce, & added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I sprinkled brown sugar on top of them before baking.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.
They were pretty tasty and the oats gave it a nice texture!  I'll make these again.

In my opinion, these muffins aren't sweet enough. In future I may add more banana or substitute a little brown sugar.

Also, I wouldn't suggest baking these muffins at 400. They were too dark on the outside, and nearly raw on the inside. 350 usually works well for banana muffins.

This is a wonderful recipe the entire family enjoyed.  I like the added oats for both texture as well as nutrition.  My kids enjoy crumb toppings on muffins, so I added that to these and it really added more flavor!  Can't go wrong with these muffins!

I wasn't particularly impressed with these muffins.  They were kind of chewy.  My 3 and 5-year old daughters usually love banana muffins but pretty much left all of these behind.
While they weren't awful, they weren't very inspiring.  I won't be making them again.

This is a great recipe to adapt to what you have on hand. I used 3/4 c. banana, about 1/4 c. oil and almost half a cup of applesauce. The result was intensely moist. I also threw in a dash of cinnamon but don't think it was necessary. Mine took only about 15 minutes to cook and were great right out of the oven.

I made this recipe pretty much as written and was pleased with the results (substituted brown sugar, part whole wheat flour, quick oats instead of rolled, and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg).  The muffins were nicely browned, moist and not too sweet.  I got 17 standard size muffins.  The oats give them a nice toothsome texture.

I didn't like this one too much since it wasn't sweet at all, but if that's what you're looking for, this might be good. I also thought the oatmeal made the texture too heavy and chewy. I probably won't make it again.

I thought these were great - just the right amount of banana flavor.  I used brown instead of white sugar, added 1 tsp cinnamon and a whole tsp of vanilla, then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  I got 12 regular sized muffins and 12 mini muffins out of the recipe!

Made these for the first time and my family really liked them.  My four year old is not a big breakfast eater and we are usually on the run in the morning.  I like these muffins because, they are just enough to fill his little belly up and they are quick.  After baking them, I threw the muffins into the freezer and then pull one out at a time and warm in the microwave.  I also like them because I feel like they are relatively healthy.  Even my 17 month old likes them.  Thanks for the recipe

This is a great basic recipe because you can do almost anything with it, depending on what you have on hand.  I used the applesauce instead of sugar option, added banana chips, cinammon, and a little maple syrup and chopped walnuts.  They were great.

We loved these muffins. I added 1/2 c. chocolate chips, as recommended. I used the miniature ones since that's all I had. My daughter loved them with the chocolate, my husband thought the chocolate was a distraction, so next time I will make 1/2 with, 1/2 without. Great either way. I also used 1/4 c. egg substitute instead of the egg and that made them even healthier without compromising the taste.

Sorry that I don't agree with most of the earlier reviews.  I found these rather dry and not as flavorful as I had expected. I added the cinnamon and walnuts but it still needed more.  The second half of the batch I added some more vanilla and sprinkled sugar on top of the muffins before baking which helped.  Don't think that I'll make them again.

These turned out perfect. The only thing I did differently is: I made 6 large size muffins, baked at 350, and didn't bother mashing bananas, just cut them up (2 med/lg to lg size bananas)

Very tasty recipe, I added almonds.  They didn't rise as much as I expected, so they're pretty dense but still good.  I'll probably make again because I love bananas and oatmeal.

Wow!  These are great!  I used half white flour and half whole-wheat flour, to make them a little more nutritious.  I also added some semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Definitely a keeper!

These were pretty good, especially if you want a healthy banana bread, but not as tasty as I'd hopped. I used applesauce instead of oil, and added a 1/2 cup more bananas.  Another downside is that these got moldy real fast.  I'll probably make them again, but simply because it's a good beakfast.

Very simple, very yummy!  These were well enjoyed by my family.  Fresh out of the oven, these muffins have a nice crunchy top and a "grainy" texture from the oatmeal.  After storage, both the tops and the texture soften up. I also used half whole wheat, half white flour for a bit more of a health kick.

Excellent recipe!  I've made numerous banana muffin recipes and these are definitely a winner!  They are lighter than most banana muffins and the oats are a great addition.  I used quick cooking oats instead of the rolled and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts, which my family loves.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

These are fantastic! The turned out perfect and were very high. I didn't scale the recipe however instead of using a 12 cup muffin tin I used an oversized 6 cup tin and they were nice and large. Flavour is wonderful! Thank you for sharing I will definately be making these again.

I did as some of the other reviewers suggested and used half white sugar and half brown sugar, I also added some semi sweet chocolate chips so that my kids would eat them, they were a hit!! So tasty, I will definitely be making these again :)

I used 1/3 cup of maple syrup instead of sugar, also added 1/4 teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon.
Tastes great!

Delicious!  Followed recipe with only a few small changes:  brown sugar, butter, doubled vanilla & added 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Wish I had had nuts to add - next time.  Thank you for the recipe!

These came out delicious. I made with whole wheat flour, a tablespoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a cup of chopped pecans and it came out delicious. I will definitely be making again.

I adjusted to 16 servings so I could use the  1 1/2 C banana I had,  adding 2 eggs (not 1 1/4!) and another 1/2 C flour.  Turned out great.

I added 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Other than that I made the recipe as stated.  Very moist, not too sweet.  I got 15 muffins  out of the batch.  I don't like the muffins to bake over onto the muffin tin so I only filled 3/4 of the way.  Baked for 18 minutes.  Came out perfect.

Great basic recipe.  We like a healthier muffin, so I used 1 c. White flour, and 1/2 c. Whole wheat flour.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 c. Brown sugar, reduced the oil to 1/4 c. (and used olive oil ).  Put in 2-1/2 large ripe bananas and some pecans.  Delicious!

I also add blueberries to this recipe and flaxseed meal to give it more fiber and omega.  It was delicious and my kids liked it which was a win.

Happy that there’s not a lot of sugar in the recipe.  Most of the sweetness comes from the bananas (and 1/2 cup chocolate chips I decided would be a hit with the kids). I also added a little cinnamon. Yum.

Used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour fand 1/2 cup white.  Subbed 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup Swerve for the sugar.  Subbed no-sugar-added applesauce for the vegetable oil.  Added about 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries.  Wow!  Delicious!

These were great! I used oat milk because it was all I had on hand and Splenda instead of sugar. I sprinkled a little cinnamon in as well. Baked for 20 mins on 375 in my convection oven.  Will definitely make these again!

Best Oatmeal banana muffin recipe ever!!! I made this recipe as instructed, except, I filled the muffin tins half full, put 1/2 TBS of homemade raspberry curd in the center of each muffin, then covered them with more batter. Perfection. Great crust (no paper liners). Great flavor - did add 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Baked at 400° for 20 minutes. 12 scrumptious muffins.

I used this recipe 3 times and have managed to bake it without it being dry. Here’s what I changed :

1 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup whole meal flour
1 cup rolled oats + 3/4 cup milk (soak the oats for 30 minutes) 
1/3 cup sugar 
1/3 cup melted butter 
3/4 cup chocolate chips 
3 regular sized bananas

Should have sprayed the paper liners, but these are delicious! I substituted applesauce for the oil and used whole milk because I didn’t have skim. I also used only 1/3 cup sugar. They’re great and I’ll make them again!

This is super easy and pretty quick. I did 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup light brown. You can also add chocolate chips on top or blueberries. Another substitute is 1/3 cup oil and 3 heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter which is my favorite. Love this recipe!!

You gotta get it in the oven quickly after mixing the batter because they start expanding fast, and will produce large fluffy muffins. Pretty good recipe although I skipped 1/2 cup sugar for a cup of brown and it was just sweet enough. Remember you want muffins not cupcakes lol Other than a few addons, like cinnamon and walnuts, I followed the recipe exactly and I like the results. 5 stars.

Yummy! Made them for my family one lazy morning and they smelled so good they couldn’t wait to eat them. I did add a half cup of brown sugar and used almond milk instead of regular milk, it still tasted delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

I needed a quick muffin recipe with bananas and oatmeal for my daughter to eat in the mornings when she is rushing out the door.  I made a double batch and put 1/2 in the refrigerator to bake up the following week.  The second batch was as delicious as the first.   Next time I will consider some of the healthier adjustments mentioned by others.   I will be making these again.

Haven't tasted them yet, just out of the oven but they smell so good! Substituted oat flour (and a little xanthan gum) for the all-purpose flour, to make them gluten free; also added a little cinnamon because I think cinnamon goes well with oats and with bananas. Took 25 minutes to bake, as the bananas were VERY ripe, so you may want to consider the ripeness of the bananas when making this recipe; I could have decreased the milk to compensate (next time!). Very easy to make, this would be a good recipe for kids learning to bake, or wanting to.

Yes,I will make it again,  the only difference is I didn't have eggs so I added an extra banana. I had to make 4 patches of it because I have a family of 7 and we had guests over so everyone had two to three each. We loved it and I will be making it again.

Overall, this recipe was promising coming out of the oven. It was easy to make and actually was full of different flavors as well as textures. Something that I did is I blended the oats to make the texture creamier and smoother. Personally, I think that blending the oats was a great idea. This was definitely a 5-star recipe.

Loved the recipe! Did tweak it - did not add baking soda as I dislike the taste, and used brown sugar. Did not seem to make a difference :) Made only 7 largish muffins. Nice and fluffy.

Followed the recipe except for using 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of the white sugar and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and these came out amazing!  I'll definitely be making these again, they're great for breakfast.

Since I live at an altitude of 8500 feet, I made changes for high-altitude. I added one extra tablespoon of flour, reduced baking powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons and reduced baking soda to a scant 1 teaspoon. They turned out perfect.

Delicious. I made it as is, exact quantities except I added one small packet of baby apple sauce and about 20 small choco chips (to entice the kids into eating this). Next time I plan to add one spoon of cocoa so I can claim they're chocolate muffins. They came out of the over extremely fluffy and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness (on the low side).

I made an eggless version by substituting 1/4 cup of yogurt for 1 egg. Also, I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour. It turned out quite moist and tasty. Next time, I will add some nuts and cinnamon.

I've tried at least a dozen different muffin recipes in my years & this one is hands down the best. I made an account just to post this review bc I feel compelled to let people know lol! I've been making a lot of banana oatmeal bars lately & decided to make muffins this time instead, but I didn't want to just use the same recipe, so I gave this one a shot. The only things I changed was swapping the 1 cup oats with 2 packets of microwavable fruit-flavored oats, & switching white sugar for brown sugar, to add more flavor. I made the recipe twice, once with banana flavor & once with blueberry flavor. The banana oatmeal trick is my secret trick to make banana bread extra flavorful so it worked great with the muffins, & the blueberry flavor tasted delicious as well. I cooked them for 18 min each & they came out perfect. The batter made enough for exactly 12 heaping muffins per recipe. I would suggest using an ice cream scooper to get the same amount of batter each time. Additionally, fill the tins up almost all the way if you want a nice muffin top. They will rise a bit, but not too much. Definitely saving this recipe to make again soon! :)

I substituted butter for oil and added a cup of mini chocolate chips. They came out delicious, but just a little too crispy on the top.

This is a great basic recipe. They are moist and tasty. Definitely not very sweet.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg and chopped pecans because I like a little more flavor.

I really liked these muffins. Moist and just enough for breakfast. The only thing negative that I might say is that the oats were a bit chewy and I expected them to be a bit softer. Maybe next time I’ll let it sit for a bit before baking.  I’ll definitely make these again though. My 2 y/o loves them!

I just pulled these out of the oven. They smelled amazing at the end of the baking period. I used 3 VERY ripe bananas and had less than half of the oil, so used that plus 1/3 cup (a small single serving container) of apple sauce that I had in my cupboard. They're very moist, but not too moist. You can definitely taste the oats, but because I have a lot of banana, I can still taste that too. Some bites are more oaty while others are more bananay. I'd make them again, but I would definitely stick to using 2-3 ripe bananas (I think it was 1.5 cups, maybe a bit more).

These are delicious! Even my kids that don't like banana bead/muffins gobbled these up. I substituted brown sugar for the white, and applesauce for the oil, and used half whole wheat and white flours. These substitutions were because I was trying to make them more nutritious as a quick breakfast before school. These would be perfect as the recipe is written, too! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

A good recipe, but can't say it would be my all time favorite.  Though in truth I did a few things that may have taken it from a 5 star to a 4 star....my fault.  I used grapeseed oil for the oil, 1 t. of vanilla instead of the 1/2, and a dash of cinnamon.  My muffins just did not have that nice muffin texture.  It was on the heavy side.  Will mention one thing though,  mine made 1 1/2 dozen instead of the 1 dozen.  I used a 1/3 cup measure to fill each paper lined cup and it was perfect.

One of my all-time favorite muffin recipes. I made it filling the recipe exactly except I substituted almond milk for the dairy milk. Absolutely delicious— my whole family loved them — kids too. Perfect breakfast for busy mornings.

Yum. These are super good. I followed others' advice and used two eggs, a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. Also, I read the feedback from others that the muffins seemed a tad dry. I lowered the heat to 375. I also used four bananas. Really good! Thank you!

Basic recipe is a good start but 5 star with my changes. Substituted my gluten free flour blend for all purpose flour, 1/4 cup applesauce + 1 Tblsp oil for the oil, added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, used 3 med size bananas, all brown sugar instead of white,  and topped with 6-7 blueberries poked down into batter of each muffin prior to baking. Made 15 muffins

Definitely a good recipe as far as they taste like classic peanut butter cookies. I’m not totally satisfied with the texture of mine, and I think it has to do with two things: I think the peanut butter I used wasn’t up to standard. I used creamy Jiff,  and honestly, Skippy would have been better but I bought the wrong brand. I feel Skippy has more peanut flavor, and I’m even wondering if one of the all natural peanut butters, thoroughly blended, of course, would have been better. The homogenized peanut butters I feel yield a result more like margarine, making the dough less workable. It tends to separate. (I used a KitchenAid mixer on low and medium). I don’t know if that had anything to do with my result, just for general info I’m stating it. The other thing was definitely take longer than an hour to chill the dough. I feel it would help keep the classic shape. Lastly, ovens vary so. I baked my first batch just as recipe states, but they were too soft. I put them back in. I like crispy. I think you could even go to 12 minutes without burning them, but at 10 minutes, just watch them and see. Once you see color going golden, take out as they will harden up on the rack.

I made these muffins to take on a camping trip and was somewhat disappointed by what I perceived as a lack of flavor.  I did substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil, but I don't think that would have made a big difference.  These muffins are OK - just not terrific.  I likely won't make them again.

Easy, adaptable muffin but if you are using paper liners be sure to spray the liners first; otherwise the paper is messy to peel off. These freeze well.

Amazing! Ok, so I accidentally used 1 cup skim milk so I reduced the oil to 2 Tbsp. I also reduced sugar to 1/3 cup brown sugar because 1/3 cup mini semi-sweet morsels found their way into the muffins. So tender and delish!

Very easy to make.  I have made this several times. Once I made 24 mini muffins with this recipe.  The muffins are moist and tasty.  My children love them.  
I prepare the dry ingredients at night then complete the recipe in the morning.  20 minutes tops, 18 of it is the baking.  I love this recipe!

I made these for on busy mornings and put them to freeze, I doubled the recipe and when I saw the batter it was really thick which would potentially make a dry muffin so I added an extra egg, a cup of water, cinnamon to the 2nd dozen , 4 oz of milk and 2 oz of oil and they came out perfect.

Like just about everyone else, I made changes.  I borrowed some from my favorite banana bread recipe.  I wasn't trying to make them more healthy, but instead wanted to make sure they didn't turn out dry.  I used 2/3 cup sugar and a half cup of oil.  I also added 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecans.   These additions make way more than just a dozen muffins, but my family loves them.  With the changes they are 5 stars.  Watch that you don't overcook them.  I'm at a somewhat high altitude, and I tend to pull them out at 15 minutes.

I did not like these.  I took the advice from other reviews and added some cinnamon but these were still bland tasting.  They also came out with a rubbery texture on the top of the muffin.

These taste very...healthy....like barely banana bread and more like just bread. That said, every once in a while you need a good muffin that you can eat at breakfast and say it’s healthy. Very neutral. You may wish to jazz it up with butter or jam when you eat it (read as you WILL want jam or butter)

I love how simple this recipe is! I swapped the flour/oat ratios , blended the oats for better texture, substituted brown instead of white sugar, and added 1 and a half cups of blueberries. It came out to 12 perfectly full and moist muffins. I will definitely be using this as a base for my muffin recipes.

This recipe has a lot of good reviews which is probably because it is a good basic banana muffin recipe. But since I make banana bread a lot and I always put cinnamon, dash of nutmeg and vanilla flavoring in my bread I of course wanted them in my muffin as well. I used half a teaspoon cinnamon, quarter teaspoon nutmeg and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Then used the rest of the basic recipe except my bananas came out to about 1 1/4 cups of mashed bananas and didn’t figure the extra would hurt. Then just before I was going to mix everything completely together I decided to add a half a cup of mini chocolate morsels to the dry ingredients before I mixed the dry and wet together. I have made chocolate chip banana bread before and it was delicious. Since I had the mini ones on hand, I felt like they  would be better for the muffins instead of the regular sized chocolate chips. Then because I love nuts with my banana bread and I didn’t want to put the nuts inside the batter, after I put the batter in the muffin tin I sprinkled chopped pecans on top of each muffin and pressed it down into the batter a little so they would stick. By putting them on top of the muffins the pecans got toasty and brown which gave the muffins a little extra crunch.  I went ahead and baked them the full 20 minutes since I had added the chocolate chips and a little extra banana and then the nuts on top, assuming they would need the extra couple of minutes to get the nuts brown on top.

This is a good basic recipe. They are not particular flavorful, but neither are saltines, and I can eat a whole box. They sort of have that same thing going for them. I used homemade coconut milk. They turned out nice and moist. The oatmeal gave them a nice nutty quality (maybe it was the coconut milk?). I was able to get 18 moderately sized muffins. I will make them again to keep around for a quick snack.

I have made a LOT of banana muffins and I have to say this is my favorite recipe yet! I used half whole wheat flour, half regular, replaced the sugar with maple syrup, and added half a cup each of walnuts and dark chocolate chips. Also coconut oil in place of vegetable oil and I used almond milk instead of regular milk. Absolutely delicious!

Good recipe.  I used a bit less sugar because I usually have very ripe bananas, and did half brown sugar, and half white sugar.  I also added cinnamon, nutmeg and a bit of cloves for added flavour.  I've also since added blueberries, nutella (which kind of worked), and chocolate chips.

Really yummy muffins and they turned out great even at high altitude. It is so nice to have a recipe that specifies the amount of mashed banana by a cup measurement rather than saying ‘two to three bananas ‘ because it is not like fruit is always the same size! I did a few adjustments to make these a tad healthier: applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour (1 cup & 2 Tbls is the conversion),  a tsp of cinnamon, and increased vanilla to 2 Tbls. The extra vanilla and cinnamon help sweeten and counter the wheat taste... I also sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top because why not! These have been my breakfast for a few days and the recipe is definitely a keeper.

The first time I made these muffins I added raisins.  They were delicious.  I have now altered the recipe and use maple syrup instead of the white sugar.  (I usually only use white sugar for hummingbird food!) Because it seemed a bit runny I added about another quarter up of flour. They are good with whatever fruit you have, blueberries, dates, pineapple pieces, dried cranberries. also delicious if you add some nuts, walnuts, pecans or almonds.  This is my go to muffin recipe now.  Oh and I only use silicone muffin bakers so no need for paper liners.

I tweaked the recipe and these muffins were so delicious.  Instead of  1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, I changed to 3/4 cup of white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup ground flaxseed.   I added 1/2 cup walnut pieces and baked at 375 degrees for 22 minutes.   Perfection!

This is a delicious and moist muffin. I don't understand why people change the recipe and then rate it. To me,  the rating then represents THEIR recipe, not the original. It can be fun to change up a recipe -- but please make the original first, then share your suggested changes.

These were a bit dry and flavorless.  People who like plain food will enjoy these but people with more refined palettes won't. It is probably the oats, which absorb liquid, which make them dry.  Definitely have to add more liquid (oil or milk).  If I made these again I would add plain greek yogurt in place of the milk (for moisture) and add some spices, like cinnamon, nutmeg and/or cloves.

I changed it up. Already made a 1 c rolled oats, blueberries, 2 tsp honey, 1 tsp vanilla and 2 c almond milk breakfast soak overnight.  I had drained most of the milk and used this mix in the recipe that I doubled up, added more oatmeal and used the 1/2 c brown and white sugars each.  Also substituted the oil for 1 c applesauce and also added a strussel on top before baking.  A really nice and light muffin recipe and great use of ingredients already half done!  Thank you.  I can't wait to suprise everyone at work!

These are really moist and delicious and this is indeed a foolproof recipe. I added 4 tablespoons of almond powder and flax and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Also used brown sugar (will use Splenda next time) instead of white. They were nutritious and satisfying. It's the best recipe here.

These are probably the best I’ve made—and I’m a good baker who’s made a lot of muffins! I will absolutely make these again. I substituted half brown sugar and half white, and I added a cup of dried cherries since I had some on hand. I love chocolate chips in banana muffins but went for a healthier add-in. These were moist, and wonderfully dense. I sprayed the paper liners with baking spray + flour which was a good tip and I lost less of the muffin to the paper. Delicious!

This was my first try at banana oat muffins. These were great! I followed a lot of other reviewers' suggestions. I used 3 ripe, mashed bananas, substituted homemade apple sauce for oil (and actually used 2/3 cup applesauce), used unsweetened almond milk in place of regular milk, 3/4 white and 3/4 whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup each of white and brown sugar and threw in some semi-sweet chocolate chips. I baked them at 375 degrees for approximately 25 mins. Hearty and tasty! I will definitely make these again!

These muffins are delicious! Will definitely make these again. I did as other reviewers suggested and did half AP flour and half WW flour. I used applesauce instead of oil. I also did half white sugar and half brown sugar. I added in cinnamon and nutmeg. I then topped the muffins before going in the oven with a mix of white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon.

It was very delicious! Doubled the recipe because we had two bananas available, and added chocolate chips to make it even better! For a stronger banana flavor, we might consider adding more banana, but thank you for this recipe!

My first successful muffins, simple and easy to make. My hubby loves it. Also tasted as good as fresh after defrosted(by microwave). So I baked a lot of it to have in in freezer then he can heat it up for breakfast daily.

I made a few changes...  I soaked the oats in the milk for about 1/2 hour.  Using melted butter instead of oil, I added that to the oat/milk mixture then added in the rest of the wet ingredients.  I also used 4 over-ripe mashed bananas, 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c light brown sugar. 

The muffins are moist and delicious. Perfect for breakfast because they are not too sweet and are hearty because of the oats.

I have tried so many banana muffin/bread recipes, this one is a winner!  I love it. Yes, I made a couple small changes. I didn't have milk on hand, I used my King Arthur Buttermilk  powder and water to substitute the milk.  I added a small amount of cinnamon and about  a third of a cup or so of walnuts. I don't ever use white sugar but evaporated cane sugar (which is a little sweeter than white sugar) I did see reviews about these being dry, that means too much flour or smaller eggs/bananas, I weigh my flour so I don't add too much. These muffins were not dry, a perfect texture. 

This is my new go to Banana muffin recipe. Awesome, Thanks!

Very good, not too sweet, not too much banana flavor. I thought just right. I used Vegetable Oil this time but will try to use the apple sauce next time.

My husband used almost all but a few drops of the bottle of vanilla and put it back on the shelf!! Since I was almost done making the recipe when I found out, I added what little vanilla was left and added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and crossed my fingers. Turned out pretty good! My teenagers  loved them, and so did the vanilla thief. (used applesauce instead of oil)

These muffins were really good. My husband is very picky and he loved them. 12 muffins  only lasted us (I gave away 2 of them) 2 days!

These turned out perfectly! I added a little bit of cinnamon and used sugar in the raw instead of white sugar. I also made these in a mini muffin tin and cooked for 13 minutes at 400 degrees. Perfect breakfast on the go for my kids!

Very good.  I saw in previous posts that they were a bit dry so we mashed up a little extra banana, and I baked them only 16 minutes.  It was perfect.  My girls loved them.

I love fiber rich foods such as oatmeal. But I didn't like it much for this baking. I used 100% wholegrain rolled oats. It didn't go well.

1/4 brown sugar 1/4 sugar in the raw, unsweetened vanilla almond milk and flax seed egg for a vegan option turns out wonderfully. Also added walnuts and mixed raisins 1/8 nutmeg and 1/8 cinnamon 2nd time around for a nice twist!

I made this recipe with white instead of unbleached flour. The muffins were delicious, chewy and soft! This is a great use of those overripe bananas as I work on my "waste no food" goal!

I used coconut sugar and substituted 1/2 cup of coconut flour for the regular a.p. flour.  I didn't have 1/3 cup of oil so use the tiny bit left in the bottle and melted Nutiva Organic Shortening to finish the 1/3 cup oil.  Wasn't very sweet, but just right. I cut up a few pecans and stuck in 4 of them, leaving 8 without pecans.   Delicious.

Fabulous recipe! I made the following changes: First, I doubled the recipe so I could have some freezer muffins readily available. I then added 1/2 cup toasted wheat germ, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, used 4 whole eggs, added an extra banana, and added some cinnamon and nutmeg. I made 24 standard muffins (no liners) with this base recipe and topped them with a streusel of wheat germ, oats, flour and brown sugar. For the remaining batter I added 1 cup of blueberries, dusted in flour. Next time I'll sub the oil for applesauce, I just didn't have any on hand for this round. This recipe is phenomenal and absolutely a keeper! It's not overly sweet, but doesn't taste like a 'healthy' recipe and my 3 and 5 year old devoured them!

Just made these for my 21 month old daughter for an easy, healthyish breakfast and was "more" and "mmmmmmmmm" as she gobbled them up. They were easy to make and I had all the ingredients at home.

I'm in Colorado and I baked these at 375 for 10 mins. They're very moist but a tad bland. Think I'll add chocolate chips next time for a little more sweetness.

This really was just okay.  I think it needs more sugar.  I tweaked the recipe a bit after reading some of the reviews; added a second egg, did 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar.  A little disappointed.  Won't make again

Good for a healthy option. But sweetness is less. Will try with more sugar next time.
Since sugar was less, I served dipped in Mango shake. The result was different and amazing!

Followed recipe exactly except didn't use the paper liners and greased my muffin tin well with butter (and they all fell out upon flipping the pan). 
I have zero complaints about this recipe, it was simple to make and turned out perfectly the way I hoped.  They don't taste "healthy" but I love that there's a good amount of oats in there. Also pleased with the shape, i don't like it when muffins are flat and these were nice and round on top, despite the dubious picture.

I used Almond Milk but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Loved it! Might try applesauce instead of oil next time (that's what I normally use) but, might not because I really liked how they turned out this time, applesauce would make them more moist.

I made a few changes as well based on reviews and trying to make this a little more moist;

3/4 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup + 1 tbsp white sugar 
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup applesauce (subbing for oil)
1 cup milk 
2 medium bananas 
1 cup chocolate chips 
Delicious!

I made no changes to this recipe and I will not make them again.  For the time and ingredients required after all was said and done they had no taste and were on the dry side.  Disappointing to say the least.

Love this recipe... made it exactly as described and it was perfect and moist, with nice golden-brown tops.  Mmm.  My kids loved them.  I can tell it's the kind of quick-bread recipe that stands up well to substitutions and tweaks, as many have described here, but I loved them as is, and will definitely make them again.

Delicious!  I used applesauce instead of oil, and nonfat milk.  I also added some pecans, a small amount, and a small amount of chocolate chips.  Was tempted to use two eggs, as one reviewer suggested, but stayed with one and I thought they were perfect. This made a dozen muffins. Will make again for sure!

You have to compensate for the saltiness of the oats. I would add more sugar or some brown sugar. They are good. Just not very sweet.

I made the first batch almost exactly as the recipe is written, only adding one more egg and 1/2 teasp cinnamon. Baked for 18 mins at 375 degrees because I have a convention oven. Delicious and moist. The batch yielded 14 large muffins. The second time I made it, I still added 1 more egg, one more banana, 1/3 cup fresh blueberries, 1/3 cup crushed cashew nuts, 1/2 teasp cinnamon. Baked @ 375 degrees convention oven for 17 mins. Boy, it was moist and delicious! This batch yielded 18 large muffins.

Great recipe and so much easier and less time consuming than banana bread. I used Vanilla Almond Milk instead of milk, and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and chopped walnuts.

I used large flake oats (what I had on hand), and the muffins came out a bit dry. Use regular oats, whenever possible. Also, I easily substituted the sugar with coconut sugar and the milk with almond milk due to food sensitivities in the household and the muffins are still very tasty. Easy to make for those with dairy and sugar intolerances.

I cannot comment on the original recipe because I made a few changes but I LOVED THE results. 
I used only 1 cup of white flour and added 1/4 cup each of milled flaxseed and chai seeds to add more nutritional value. I also added about 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. 

Also...because I made it more "nutritional" I didn't feel guilty adding some chocolate chips haha 

They didn't need to be baked as long as the recipe calls for. I also put them in the oven for about 11 minutes and they came out perfect.

This muffin recipe is fantastic! I did make the following changes: 
I used whole wheat flour instead of white, brown sugar in place of regular sugar, and 1% buttermilk. I sprinkled the tops with oats also before baking. Delicious! Will definitely be making these again!!

These were awesome, but I did a few things to make them a little healthier and less caloric, admittedly. I used half whole wheat flour, I split the egg and used half egg whites, replaced a little more than half of the oil with unsweetened apple sauce, used unsweetened almond milk, and used half brown sugar and a dash more vanilla (not that using brown sugar cuts calories but it does add flavor when you've used whole wheat flour that can be a little strong, and brown sugar helps with the moisture when using whole wheat flour too.).  These were fantastic, two teenage boys ate six in one sitting, and the smell drew them out of bed.  These changes work out to @153 calories per muffin if you get 12 muffins out of it, bigger would be more obviously. Plus a whole lot more fiber because of the whole wheat flour and applesauce. I could use an alternate sugar but I just hate the taste, so I change what I know we will still like. I only had so much applesauce so had to use some oil, but I think they'd be fine switching out all the oil with applesauce, and that would cut the calories and fat content even more.

You can easily double the bananas and then cut back on the sugar a tad. Turn out super moist this way. I also added cinnamon. With doubled banana this recipe easily makes 18 full muffins. Kiddos loved them. Keeping them in the freezer for quick grab and go breakfasts. Have already made 3 batches this way!

I didn't make any changes except I only had foil liners and a mini muffin pan. I kept an eye on them but they still came out a little dark. Taste wise i'm not a big fan they just aren't sweet enough. I should have trusted my gut. Next time I will add an additional 1/4 cup of brown sugar and see if that makes the difference.

In order to reduce sugar, I used 1/2 cup of granulated Splenda instead of white sugar.  These are so easy and delicious!  I have added chopped walnuts and/or various fresh fruits (blueberries, raspberries, etc.).  This may cause you to have more than 12 muffins but the cooking time did not needed to be adjusted.

Excellent. Easy to make. Moist. Will make again. I'm living overseas and don't have a muffin pan, so divided the batter and baked in two bread pans, lowering the temperature a bit and cooking a bit longer.

These are excellent muffins!  To make the texture a little lighter I put the oats in my mini chopper (small food processor)  and make an oat flour.  I also cut the sugar in 1/2 and add flax meal, hemp hearts and wheat germ, as I have small kids and trying to get some extra fiber into them.
Chopped pecans or walnuts and/or chocolate chips are a nice addition as well.

I forgot to add the sugar! I was baking in a hurry (spur of the moment muffins for breakfast before work! :D), missed the part about sugar, and the muffins were still yummy because the bananas were super ripe--a plus for me as someone who tries to limit sugar. Albeit, I did top them with chocolate chips and threw half a cup of chips in the batter, too, which is what I was going to do anyway for my fiancee's happiness. But it was only lightly sweet and quite moist because I added an extra banana  to limit food waste. It was too moist so I baked them longer, which still turned out fine; it was still a bit wet so make sure you modify the dry ingredients which I didn't. But I don't mind a little wetness when you're starving in the middle of traffic! Fat doesn't bother me--your brain needs it and low-fat diet isn't that healthy--so apple sauce substitution is a no-no for me, but I don't use vegetable oil anyway; instead, I used a high-grade olive oil which you cannot taste in the muffins.

Good and tasty for two days. Third day was already dried out...wonder why :-(. Maybe because I did not add sugar? Wasn't sweet enough for the kids. Will try again with the sugar next time.

Love these. I took some of the reviewers ideas and combined them. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup splenda for the sugar, 1/2 c egg beaters for egg, I added nuts and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 teasp. nutmeg. I also used original applesauce for oil. I didn't have natural or unsweetened applesauce.

They are moist.  They didn't rise as much as I would have liked.  I filled them 2/3 full and the muffins were flat.  The muffin cup really needs to be full in order to get a nice rounded muffin.  Will make again  adding some chopped nuts.

This is my "go to" recipe when I have over ripe bananas. I usually follow the recipe exactly but sometimes I add chocolate chips, or use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil,  or add peaches with the bananas,  etc. This is a great base recipe for muffins.

Always good, even better with coconut! I made this recipe several times following the recipe exactly, only using whole wheat flour and halving the sugar as I don't like muffins too sweet. But coconut is my secret new ingredient! One time when I didn't have milk I subbed half the oil and all milk for coconut milk. And I added an extra mashed banana, an extra egg and some shredded coconut instead of sugar...no need for extra sugar! If you don't like coconut, rest assured: coconut adds a light sweet creamy flavour, but it is totally a banana-oat muffin. Last time I added dried craisins and that was also good. The recipe is very versatile!

The first time I made these, I found them to be a bit too dry, so I made some changes that worked wonderfully.  Because I live at 9350 ft, I am also including the high altitude changes.
-substituted brown sugar for white
1/2 tsp baking powder (high altitude change)
1/4 tsp baking soda (high altitude change)
2 eggs
4 bananas
baked at 350 F 18 min.
I also added a cup of pecans and a cup of chocolate chips, because, you know, chocolate makes most everything taste better.

I used some whole grain flour instead of all  "all-purpose" flour for this and added some spices for extra flavour: nutmeg and cloves. I doubled it into two large batches, some with walnuts and dark chocolate chips and some with a crumb topping. They, turned out great! I will definitely make them again.

great base recipe I "doctored up"  by adding SOME brown sugar, almond oil, cream cheese, and finely chopped nuts. They came out moist enough and tasty, hearty without being dense.  I will make them again this way. The oats add nice unexpected texture. May try some sour cream instead of cream cheese next time.

As  others did I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, half brown sugar and half white, and added 1 cup fresh strawberries cut into small pieces and folded in. I agree with another who said need blueberries, it needs fruit as it's quite bland, but still ok as is.

These were so good. I never thought I would find a recipe as good as my old family but easier! I've always used overripe, frozen & thaw quickly for extra moistnest. I've never liked the 'feel' of oats  so next time i'm going to 'make' the oatmeal & add some cinnamon &  nutmeg while I'm at it. I'm definately using this recipe again and probably as my 'base' for all muffin varieties.

I loved how crisp and crunchy the muffin top was! I followed the recipe pretty much as written the only modifications I made was to add a tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp grated fresh nutmeg. I love the oats , it gives the muffin a nice texture, next batch I made a little topping with oats , butter and a little brown sugar, sort of a strussel topping just to change it up a little. The recipe made 18 muffins and not the 12 it stated, and it also cooked much faster than the recipe stated they were done in 15 minutes, so watch yours closely!

I have made this three times now. First time, exactly as recipe stated.  DELICIOUS!!! Second time, replaced 2 tablespoons of the white sugar for brown sugar (personal preference). Third time, same change with sugar and added 1 cup fresh blueberries. All 3 times they were devoured. Everyone loved them each time.

Loved this recipe.  Instead of using 1/2 cup of white sugar I used  most of it brown, a few tablespoons of white and a bit of honey to make the 1/2 cup.  Excellent muffin and I would make them again.

Made exactly as the recipe directed, except I didn't have oil so I used melted butter. Texture was great. It was moist without being dense. Not overly sweet and perfect for a grab and go breakfast that won't make me feel like I just ate a cupcake. But, overall the taste didn't have that banana taste I prefer. It wasn't bland per se, but it wasn't great either. I am going to make this again and increase the amount of banana included, and maybe switch to whole wheat flour since I'm low on white. If the banana flavor pops with out needing more sugar, this will be my go to summer muffin!

These were a bit hit with the family!  We had some out of town relatives come in to visit and I wanted to make something "popable" for breakfast.  I made these in my mini-muffin tins and they were delicious, even the kids loved them!  In doing it again, I'd probably bake them for 2-5 min less than what the recipe suggested.  (They made 48 mini-muffins)

This is my favorite  banana muffin recipe! For the flour, I use 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup all purpose flour. I also add 3/4 cup chocolate chips. They come out perfect every time.

Great, quick muffin recipe & exactly what i was looking for. Thank you!
I only had one banana so I grated some zucchini to add in. 
I did use 1 Tablespoon of butter accompanied with unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil. I made mini-muffins two ways with the batter. 
I added walnuts to one variation which i enjoy in most breads, but not so much my son.
The other one i added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of dark chocolate unsweetened cocoa powder.

I enjoyed both cery much and will make them again- i ate too many!!!

I made several changes.  I used almond milk instead of regular milk, unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, a cup of oat flour and a half cup of whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour, two egg whites instead of a whole egg, an eighth of a cup truvia and a quarter cup of truvia brown sugar instead of white sugar and I added three tablespoons of ground flaxseeds.  They turned out great!  I made as mini muffins and with the changes I made they are 38 calories and 7 carbs per mini muffin.

My husband and I loved these with my additions.  I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 3/4 cup dried blueberries, and used grape seed oil and old fashioned oats. I whizzed the oats in the food processor and let them soak in the milk while I measured the other ingredients. I listened to the other reviewers and sprayed the baking cups and baked at 350 degrees. Delish.

Great recipe.  I tweaked it a bit, adding a little more banana, some grated nutmeg, a touch of cinnamon,  and chopped walnuts.  I love the banana  flavor and the taste is not too sweet.

I made the recipe as shown and the muffins were excellent.  They did not require a 20 min bake time though.  I only had them in for 16 mins and they were perfect.  Perhaps that's why another reviewer said they were a bit dry.  Mine were exceptionally moist and delicious!!

Very delicious! I did alter the recipe to make it a bit healthier. I added 1 tbsp each flaxseeds, hemp seeds, chia seeds and wheat bran. I added 3 mashed ripe bananas and it turned out very moist.

Made them exactly as instructed and they are delicious!  A bit of crunch but also moist.  Definitely will be making these again.

I replaced the white flour with whole wheat and added 1 1/2 cups of blueberries. Had to add a few minutes cooking time because of the fruit but they were moist and delicious!  My kids said there were so many berries they didn't need jam.  Also made an oat crumble topping which I sprinkled before cooking.  4 TBSP oatmeal and 2 TBSP brown sugar.

Just wanted to make a breakfast muffin. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and added coconut.  If you prefer a sweeter muffin you should add chocolate chips or raisins. They were done in 15 minutes.

I too have made some substitutions.  Unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  Flaxseed meal instead of egg.  Plus I make mine into mini muffins.  My whole family loves them.  Great dessert for kids lunches!!

Just made these. Came out fluffy and expanded nicely. I mixed it in my blender to pour it out easier. Great recipe. I omitted the oil since it was a great liquid to flour consistency and used 2 ripe bananas. I also used brown sugar instead of the white and they fluffed right up. It only took about 15 min to bake in the middle rack at 400 degrees. Comes out to 150 cal per muffin and makes a dozen just right. Just fill the muffin tin 3/4 of a way. Delish!

I made this recipe according to directions and I think the muffins turned out perfectly.  These muffins are light and not too sweet, the rolled oats lend a slightly grainy texture and give them a healthy taste.  These could even be served as a side roll for dinner.

Just what I was looking for!  I used brown sugar and added nutmeg and cinnamon and increased the vanilla for more flavor. Excellent recipe that you can amp up with additional sugar and spice should you decide to do so.

Very good and moist.  I subbed applesauce for the oil, used half brown and half white sugar.  Added 1 tsp cinnamon.  Did not use paper baking cups.  Baked 20 min at 400 convection.

Made these as mini muffins which made 3 dozen exactly. Used 4oz unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and used half white, half brown sugar. Also used quick cooking oats and 3 large ripe bananas as that's what I had on hand. Next time I'll try half whole wheat flour and half all purpose and see if the kids notice :)

So yummy, soft and NOT dense!  I substituted the butter with oil.  I doubled the recipe and ONLY used a cup of sugar for health reasons.   I also added half a chopped apple because it was in the fridge.   Will make again!! Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe is great just as it is, and I make it often! As with all muffin recipes, don't mix or stir any more than you absolutely have to. 

I usually add a dash of cinnamon and fresh-grated nutmeg to give it a little kick. A few blueberries or chocolate chips make nice additions too. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

Love these!  I did use instant rolled oats as I like the smaller cut for baking (otherwise they are the same as rolled oats), and followed others' suggestions to use 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4  cup brown sugar (instead of 1/2 cup white sugar). Perfect texture and very tasty.

I loved this recipe!!! It was so yummy!!! My kids loved it even though I made it even healthier !!! Instead of white sugar I used 1/4 cup of Stevie and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I used two eggs instead of 1, three bananas mashed (they needed used up),  3/4 cup of almond milk, and 15 Tbsp. of Flax seed in replacement of the oil. I also used old fashioned oats instead of rolled oats. They turned out great!!!!

Made some changes.  We love blueberries so we added a 1 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries, used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp, used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  Not sweet at all.  Maybe if you like it sweeter add 2 tbsp white sugar.   Don't over bake it or it will be dry.  Not all oven Heat are the same so just keep an eye on it and remove it from the oven once it's a bit golden brown on the top.

Yummy! Tasty and moist.  I added some dried cranberries just because I had them around. Unfortunately, I didn't have the unbleached flour so I just used the white all purpose. Next time I will use wheat to make them healthier. Don't forget to spray the paper liners like I did!

Used coconut oil for the vegetable oil and added slightly more than a cup of mashed banana. Used morena sugar instead of plain white sugar. Also added a tablespoon of vanilla and a 1/2 teaspoonful of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoonful of ginger. Cooked about 22 minutes. Very yummy.

These were so delicious and i love the texture! The only changes I made were to use 1 cup of white flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour (only had 1 cup of white flour left), and i used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Everything else i left the same.  These weren't too sweet which i liked.  Perfect for breakfast!!

I just made these! Awesome recipe. I added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a handful of raisins for that extra punch. The whole house smells so good! Moist and hearty muffins! Definitely making these again! I am gonna add walnuts in the next time! Thanks for sharing this wonderful, no fail recipe!!

Instead of oats, I used ground walnuts. I only used 3/4 cup, though, because they are heavier. They were like walnut muffins.They looked slightly burnt, which perplexed me, I baked them just as the recipe said. Won't make again.

I followed the recipe exactly (except that I had a little more than 1 cup of mashed banan) and, unfortunately, it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.

Followed some other reviewers suggestions - Used brown sugar instead of white, 2 eggs instead of 1, used whole wheat flour and added a tablespoon of wheat germ and a tablespoon of ground flax for extra healthiness! Turned out light and moist, will make again the same way; have also added about 1/2 cup lightly toasted chopped pecans and thought they were even better!

Made this today with and for my kids for breakfast. I did revise and ended up with a slightly dry less sweet muffin. The girls loved it. We wanted less sugar. I put in three packets of trivia and some honey in place of the sugar. I ground up oatmeal and made an oatmeal flour. I used  1/2 oatmeal flour  1/2 all purpose flour. I sprinkled a little cinnamon in and used fresh vanilla bean. I crushed a few nuts and tossed them in and added a 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips. My girls (who don't get a lot of suga) loved them. I found them a little bland.

I modified the recipe by using applesauce instead of oil, homemade date paste instead of sugar and whole wheat pastry flour.  I soaked the oatmeal in warm milk to cook it a bit since my plan was to make waffles instead of muffins.  The waffles came out soft like pancakes but my kids like it and wasn't that sweet so I sprinkle powder sugar on top.

Very good. It doesn't even need a fancy topping to taste great. The only thing I did was use 1/4 brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar and it turned out wonderfully!

I chose to 1:1 substitute quick oats for the roalled oats, avocado oil for vegtable oil, and coconut sugar for white sugar. I also added 2 tbsp of golden flax seed meal for added omega 3s. I had some frozen bananas, I thawed/softened them in the microwave to use, next time I want to make sure I have some freshly ripe ones available. Baked at 400 for 18 minutes. 

Deliciousness. They are very moist. A reasonable baked good for breakfast, not very sweet with the low glycemic sugar substitute. I was worried they would have a strong vanilla due to the sugar choice as well, however the very much are balanced with the banana and oats. I will add more texture to these muffins next time with some chopped walnuts and perhaps even grated carrots. Otherwise, very happy with my experiment. 

I chose to make all the above subs due to the items  already being in my cupboard. I am glad did, these smell and taste delicious.

I used 3 overripe, spotted bananas,
I added 3/4 to 1 cup of dried :ranberries.
I didn't have milk, so I substituted 1/2 cup condensed milk and 1 single serving of cinnamon applesauce (measures approx. 1/3 cup).
I also didn't use paper cupcake liners -- I sprayed muffin pan with Pam Butter-flavored cooking spray instead to prevent sticking.
They came delicious!! Moist, not dry which can sometimes happen when using Oats.

like others i made some substitutions:  whole wheat instead of white flour, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil,  used 3 bananas, and used 1/2 cup granulated stevia + two tbsp of brown sugar instead of white sugar to reduce sugar content but make them taste a little sweeter.  added some cinnamon, also used egg replacer and almond milk to make this dairy free, and added an extra tsp of baking powder to retain rising in absence of the eggs.  Came out perfect!  Great base recipe that can be altered in such great successful variations as proven by the other reviewers.

We were happy with these. They rose well. Used 1 very ripe banana, and they taste a lot like banana. I did use 1/2 C of whole wheat flour as part of the flour.  Next time I'll use only all-purpose flour.  For baking soda, they only need 1/2 tsp.  Suggest adding crushed walnuts.

wonderful, made with 6 bananas, 2/3cup brown sugar (unpacked), 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup of raisins. so moist and not too sweet. I think 1/4 cup of raisins might be perfect for me, since I don't like too many raisins. thanks for the recipe ! I will try adding blueberries next time

I made this recipe for my Ornish diet in-laws and they LOVED it!!!  I did have to make just a few minor adjustments to recipe...  Use whole wheat flour, egg beaters, and applesauce instead of oil.  Then, I added some dried cranberries.  Even with these changes, they LOVED it!!!

These were really good. Substituted white flour for whole wheat, white sugar with brown and vegetable oil with olive oil. They tasted great. Will try using apple sauce next time and definitely will add some nuts.

Very moist. Did add 3 bananas, not sure if it was more than a cup.  Added walnuts and it was good.  I may reduce the heat next time as others suggested. I feel the outside cooked too fast compared to the middle.  Will save and make again!

These are really good. I did not change anything. I carefully doubled the recipe and made 24 muffins because I did had so many bananas. We really enjoyed them!! I also skipped the muffin papers and greased the pans with some butter.

I only gave it four stars because I did a few changes. Instead of oil, I used unsweetened apple sauce and I used half white and brown sugar. 
It was really good! 
The recipe did not say to preheat the oven, so I already did. The only thing is, I think 400 degrees is too high for muffins. I took it out in 15 minutes and they were already done. I lined a 12-muffin pan with paper cups (and did not spray the inside) and some of the muffin stuck to to the paper cups. I think next time I will check on it start at 9 minutes. 
Thank you

In 1 word: WOW! I loved these... they are so easy to make and come out perfect with only the recipe - as is.

I guess lower fat substitutions can work out well here. I added some walnuts because they are just so good with bananas :-)

These are bland and have a weird texture.  No flavor. Very dry too. I loaded it with salted butter after they cooked to see if even that would make them edible- it didn't.

This is my go-to banana muffin recipe! I always use raw sugar in my recipes and add cinnamon to this. Also, I prefer replacing the egg with 1/4 cup applesauce and using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I love all the variations I can make with it!

Wonderful! Very moist. I added dark chocolate chips and baked these in a mini muffin pan. Will definitely make again.

Edit: 

I made this recipe a second time, and I wanted to make it a little lower in calories so I used only 3 tbsp's oil, unsweetened almond milk, 1/3 cup sugar, and added half a cup blueberries. It turned out very well, still very moist with a great texture.

I just made this recipe with a few changes, and they taste and look great! I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 T. Truvia  for the sugar, skim milk for the milk, and 1/4 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  I also sprinkled about 1/2 t. of brown sugar splenda on top of each muffin.  I feel these changes made this recipe healthier, and the texture and taste is still great!!

I just made these muffins and I think they are great.  Not super moist but not dry either.  I filled the muffin cups 2/3 full and had enough batter to make 17 muffins.

Just made these, and taking into account the advice of other reviewers I used half white/half brown sugar and 2 eggs; at the very end I folded in a couple handfuls of fresh blueberries and dang y'all! These are quick to make and really tasty, not overly sweet and really flavorful!

Great taste but i substituted whole wheat flour for the regular and it got a little dense/chewy... might try 1/2 and 1/2 wheat and white.

While mixing this up I found it looked a little bit dry.  I then added a single serving size of cherry yogurt to the mix. They came out nicely. I also only had 1 banana so I thawed about a half cup of frozen raspberries and added them to make up the rest of the volume for fruit. I'll try them again using applesauce in place of the oil. Good but not my favorite. My kids gobbled them up :)

Modified healthier recipe

3/4 cup whole wheat flour
(1/4 cup almond flour +
1/2 cup all purpose flour) or ( 3/4 cup all purpose flour)
 1 cup rolled oats
 1/4 cup white sugar
1/4cup brown sugar
 2 teaspoons baking powder
 1 teaspoon baking soda
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1 egg
 3/4 cup milk
 1/3 cup applesauce
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
 1 cup mashed bananas (about 2 bananas)
2 tbsp flaxseed (optional)
1 tsp chia seeds (optional)
1/4 cup raisins

I use oil to coat the pans and make mini muffins without cupcake covers and bake for about 11-12 mins at 350. Then when the muffins cool down I store them in the fridge. When my kid is hungry I take one out and heat for 12 secs. I had a few other kids eat this up like it was candy.

Yummy muffins!  Only changes made, I used coconut sugar instead of white, 4 bananas which probably exceeded the cup required & added a dash of cinnamon.  I ended up with 18 muffins, cooked at 375 for 15 minutes & filled the empty muffin tins with water (I put both pans in at once each made 12 muffins).  They were incredibly moist, maybe because I added so much banana but if that cures the dryness others complain about then problem solved!

Fantastic. Easy. Tasty. I used brown sugar instead of white. I think I'll add apple sauce to it next time to kick up the sweetness a little. Also added blue and blackberries to the batter and the go well with the subtle banana flavour.

The muffins were still very good. They did not rise up over the tin, so maybe leaving out the soda was not a bad thing. My bananas were very ripe, so the muffins were very sweet. I could have cut back on the sugar. They were very moist. I did not use the topping. Honestly, I was not in the mood & it is easier to freeze them without a topping . The only substitution I made was whole wheat flour for the white flour & added some chia seeds. In most recipes, I find the flour interchangeable . The muffins were not greasy at all. The next batch, I will experiment with leaving more of the oats whole, less sugar, & add the soda!  My husband thought they were great!

A definite keeper.  Very banana bread-like.  Mostly made as is.  Upon the suggestion of another reviewer, did the 1/2 c. brown sugar & 1/2 c. white sugar + 1 TBS extra w. sugar, added a splash more vanilla & a couple of dashes of cinnamon.  Thought I'd overcooked them, but they were still moist and they rose nicely.  3 overripe bananas I had saved in the freezer did the trick (after defrosting).  I can see adding blueberries, nuts, raisins, zucchini, & cranberries in future batches and maybe adding some nutmeg as others have suggested.  I will try subbing applesauce for the oil, using part wheat flour, & egg whites for the eggs to see how that turns out to make things a little healthier.  I will DEFINITELY make these again as my picky 3 y/o really enjoys these and they make a good on-the-go breakfast muffin option.

Love the idea of oatmeal in the banana muffins. I made these per the original recipe. I found them a little bland and not quite sweet enough. Texture was good and so easy to throw together. Next time I might takeERINKER82's suggestion and use the Splenda and brown sugar and for the heck of it I'll try applesauce for part of the oil. I'll also add some cinnamon and pecans. I wanted a grab and go to have with my coffee as I run out the door in the morning. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is a great recipe. I've made this at least 6 times and changed something each time.  I always substitute the oil for applesauce. Used 1/4 pureed apples & 3/4 cup of mashed bananas. Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg, substituted 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of white, added 1/4 cup pecans or walnuts & 1/4 up chopped prunes, (didn't have cranberries at the time).  Today I used 1/2 cup of apple butter instead of oil. Can't wait to try them.

Made these today just like the recipe with one small addition - chopped walnuts - and they turned out perfectly.  I did get 12 regular size muffins and also 12 mini muffins though.  But, that's a good thing because they are really good.  Not dry or flavorless as some reviewers have stated.  Will keep this recipe and definitely make again.

I knew this would be good in the original form by the reviews but had a jar of apple butter for Christmas so I thought I would use it up instead of bananas. Additionally we are on this coconut oil kick. Everything else I used is  original as a base recipe.  came out fantastic. Moist, and delicious. Thank you for the base recipe! Next time it is the original.

I honestly love this recipe. I followed the recipe down to a T. These came out soft and moist although I do think it needs some nuts. And I would add a bit more flour. But they were amazing.

This has great flavor. I omitted the egg and just added more banana so it came out a little dry, but the flavor is awesome. Will try it again.

Heavy enough to fill you, light enough not to feel like you've eaten a brick.  My daughter added chocolate chips as well, which were too sweet for me, but she enjoyed them.

This recipe was so easy and yummy. I'm looking for healthier snacks and this is a good option. I also modified the recipe slightly. I doubled the vanilla and added about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts and substituted unsweetened almond milk instead of regular. I will try other whole wheat flour and applesauce next time.

I swapped in soured milk (real sour milk) and large flake oatmeal. I also used brown instead of white sugar.  The sour milk made the batter frothy and light and thus made more than 12 muffins.  The result is fabulous.  Light, fluffy and tasty muffins.  I was so excited by the bubbly results of combining the wet and dry ingredients, that I forgot to put walnuts in.  Next time I'll add them to the dry ingredients before adding the wet ingredients.

Great recipe. I used skim milk, coconut oil, and whole wheat pastry flour. I now realize I baked at 350 for 20 min by mistake but they were cooked through and very delicate.

These muffins turned out sweet and moist, and the top baked to a beautiful, nice dark brown! Like some of the reviews suggested, I changed the sugar to 1/4 of brown sugar and 1/4 of regular cane sugar. I also added 1/2 C of Chocolate chips. Love these, will absolutely be making them again!

Great recipe!  Used half cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white to make it "healthier" and then undid that by adding two large handfuls of semisweet chocolate chips.  Had a little extra and made 6 mini muffins in addition to the 12 muffins.  They turned out with high tops and a lovely brown color. Daughter rated it a keeper and I agree. Thanks!

These are wonderful breakfast muffins - light and not too sweet. They turn out beautifully fluffy and moist inside. The only change I made was to substitute white sugar with brown and I also added some chopped pecans. I do think the nuts are needed. Next time I will try these with whole wheat flour.

The muffins were delicious. I thought it would be a little dry after taking them off the muffin tin, but turns out it's moist after taking a bite! I topped the muffins with thin almond flakes, and thinking of adding chocolate chips for the next batch. Thanks for the simple recipe!

These weren't too big of a hit with my family, though I loaded them with semi-sweet chocolate. I feel like the oats give these muffins too bitter a taste. I would suggest some sweet/tangy dried fruit like dried cranberries or caramelized orange rinds.

Very Healthy, GLUTEN FREE and Delicious! Since I've completely cut out Gluten I substituted the Flour for Oat Flour. If you do not have Oat Flour on hand you can use regular Oats and blend them in a magic bullet or blender, (Doing that with the Oats makes Flour quite easily). I also substituted the vegetable oil for 1/3 cup of apple sauce and 1/4 cup of coconut oil. (I add the oil on top of the apple sauce because oat flour is a bit more drier than regular wheat flour so you need the moisture). I also substituted the white sugar for 1/4 cup of stevia and 1\4 cup of brown sugar and added 1/2 Tsp of Cinnamon and 1/2 - 3/4 cup of Chocolate Chips. Very Yummy! My Boyfriend loves them and cant tell they are Gluten Free.

I just made this recipe for my husband and I and it turned out fantastic! I made a few changes though - I added a tsp of cinnamon and I threw in what I had left of some chocolate chips (1/2 cup). I also used 1/4c brown and 1/4c white sugar.

A good trick to mash bananas with no mess it to put them into a large ziplock bag, seal it, then use the palm of your hand to mash them. When you're done, cut one of the corners off and squeeze out like a piping bag.

1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2, didn't have enough banana so added enough canned pumpkin to make 1 cup.  added raisins and chopped walnuts.  used applesauce and just a splash of oil for the oil.

texture was lovely, but they are salty.  too much leavening?  i don't know, they just leave a weird aftertaste - salty and metallic. would not make again.

These were good. I didn't think they were the best banana based muffins I've had, but my two year old loved them and she was the one I was cooking for, so in that sense they were a big hit. Overall I thought they were a little bland. Next time I will probably substitute applesauce for the oil and see if that adds some flavor.

Fantastic~! Only changes I made was to use one teaspoon Ginger instead of vanilla since I was out and my son loves ginger and to sprinkle some sugar on top of each muffin before baking. The sugar caramelized and was awesome! This will be a regular around our house from now on!

Added 1/2 dark rye flour and 1/2 white flour. Also used apple sauce instead of oil. Worked well except for the muffins got totally stuck to the liners. Guess I should have sprayed the liners with nonstick spray first? Will also try cinnamon, nutmeg and nuts and perhaps brown sugar in the future.

These taste great, but I have made them twice and they don't rise.  The topping "bleeds" over the muffin tin and then they are impossible to get out.  I also prefer them when the oats are whole.  They are more dense and hold together better.  When I put the oats in the food processor first, they muffins weren't dense enough to stay together.  I also agree that the sugar can be reduced by at least 1/4 c.  I will probably try a different recipe before I make these again.

I cut the oil in half, added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, tripled the vanilla, used half brown/half white sugar, added an extra banana and used almond milk. It came out delicious! very moist and flavorful but not overly so. It only needed 16 minutes to cook. 18+ minutes might burn or dry them out. Definitely will make again :)

These are so good.  I used all whole wheat flour and ground flax seed in place of the eggs.  This brought the muffins down to 146 cals per muffin, and the best part, the kids LOVED them!  a must have for your recipe book!

These are delicious.  I used all whole wheat flour, so they were a little heavy - I'm sure white and whole wheat would be perfect.  I used half the sugar and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil (equal measure). I then put a teensy bit of coconut oil in each muffin tin, popped those in the oven for 8-10 seconds to melt it and then spooned the muffin mixture into the tins. I just wish I had some walnuts to add.  Thank you.  Yummy!

Dry and  flavorless. I won't be making these again. I even added cinnamon and nutmeg! I substituted apple sauce for oil like other users said. I don't like the texture of the oats in the muffins..they are not cooked through but not chewy...just awful! I cook all the time and these are the worst muffins I've ever made :(

Like others, I made some changes to make these healthier. I used King Arthur white whole wheat flour, unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and coconut palm sugar instead of white sugar. I also added a little extra vanilla to finish off the bottle. I used quick oats and they worked well. I will probably cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup the next time because my bananas were very ripe (therefore sweet) and I found the muffins to be plenty sweet for myself and my toddler, who loves them! They were done cooking after about 16 min so watch the time.

Very good, but not sweet enough for me. I used light sour cream and some water instead of the milk to get a moister muffin. Recipe could also use some cinnamon.

this recipe was easy! i added in a small handful of chocolate chips, and maybe 1/2 cup or so of walnuts to the dry ingredients before adding them to the wet ingredients. I also added a bit of honey to each muffin before baking. It yielded 16 cupcake-sized muffins (only because i didnt have any muffin wrappers, so i used cupcake wrappers in a cupcake pan instead). really good recipe!

Loved this recipe.  I changed it up and substituted a container of carrot baby food for the oil, used spelt flour for 3/4 cup of the flour, and used almond milk instead of skim milk. The carrot baby food was a little shy of 1/3 cup, so I just filled the remaining space in my measuring cup with canola oil.  I used three bananas, which looked like it was a little over the 1 cup mark.

I followed the recommendation to switch unsweetened apple sauce for the oil. I used 3 mashed bananas, which was more than 1 cup but they turned out fine, maybe this is the difference to making them moist instead of dry - like some people said. Also, I added a few choco.chips and some walnuts :)

Turned out great for me. Loved them. I added chopped walnuts, used brown sugar instead of white, and considerably less soda and powder called for. Make sure your bananas are ripe enough as that will enhance your banana flavor.

We absolutely love these!!!  I made them per the recipe BUT I totally forgot to add sugar.  Next time I will add probably half of the sugar, they still have a natural sweetness from the banana so I don't anticipate that they need a lot.  I had some leftover cream cheese frosting from a carrot cake I made & my husband put some on these muffins -- now he wants me to make them again, without the sugar, just so he can eat more with the frosting...not necessarily the healthy version I was looking for :(  I will make these again, with and without the sugar!!!  GREAT recipe!

YUMMY! I used half white/half brown sugar, 4 bananas and a 1/2 cup of apple sauce as well to ensure that it would be very moist, and also added a TON of chocolate chips into it (not even joking the muffins are probably half chocolate!). Nice and moist and good banana flavour. I doubled the recipe but with the addition of the chocolate chips it made 3 dozen.

I made these muffins as the recipe called for, and was pleased with the over all effect. The muffins were soft, with a nice firm top, and a light flavor and texture. If I make these again, I'll likely add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to bump up the banana flavor, since the oatmeal is otherwise predominant. Ideal for breakfast muffins (filling without being heavy) or as a healthy subsitute for banana bread.

I replaced the oil with apple sauce and used 2 bananas. I thought they were good but slightly on the dry side.

This was a delicious twist on the traditional banana muffins. For a healthier version, use wheat flour instead of white, unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and two egg whites instead of one whole egg. You can actually do that with any muffin recipe. Good job, Karen and THANK YOU! This is our new favorite breakfast food.

I used half wheat flour and half all-purpose flour as some of the other reviewers suggested. I also added about 3/4 cup chocolate chips, and I used 2 bananas which is probably more than 1 cup because I like a lot of banana flavor in my breads and muffins. My spin on the recipe made about 7 jumbo muffins - enough for a whole week of on-the-go breakfasts! The muffins are really delicious and moist. I think without the chocolate chips (or some walnuts), they would probably taste a little bland for me, so I rated the recipe 4 stars.

This is my new favorite banana muffin recipe!  I make them a little lighter by using ErinKR82's suggestions.  I make mini muffins for my son, and I am able to get 36 minis and 6 regular size muffins from one batch!  My 2-year-old loves them as much as I do!

I followed other users' advice to make it a bit more healthy- 2 egg whites instead of one whole, applesauce instead of oil, and 1/2 brown sugar. I also added some chopped walnuts maybe 1/3 cup). Delicious!!! Will definitely make again.

I use 2/3 cup applesauce in place of the oil and cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup. I also use whole wheat flour. With the extra applesauce these muffins are super moist and super healthy. Great for breakfast or snacking and if I need a sweet treat I just add some cream cheese icing on top (store bought).

I've made these a few times now & did make a few changes, some from other reviewers.  I doubled the recipe, used whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour used, used quick cooking oats & apple sauce instead of oil.  We LOVED them!  this is going in our favorite recipes.

I substituted a few things....instead of all purpose flour and rolled oats I used Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten Free Baking Flour and Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Rolled Oats. I also used Flax milk (sweetened), since that's all we had. Everyone LOVED it, it was nice and moist and fluffy! Next time I would like to substitute the oil for applesauce.

I did some changes.  Made these for my 16 month old and she ate four mini muffins immediately.  I used Flax seed to replace the egg, applesauce instead of oil, used 1/4 c. brown and 1/4 c. white sugar, used 1/2 c. wheat flour (plus the regular 1 c. all-purpose), dash of cinnamon, some raisins.  I added a few mini choco chips to my batch and it was just sweet enough for me.  The plain ones needed just a bit more sweetness, but the young ones don't need all the extra sugar.  Will definitely make again for my kiddos!

Sadly this recipe lost out in a side by side comparison test with Banana Crumb Muffins (but that was by a bunch of college students what do they know)..... I thought this recipe gave the muffins a great oaty flavor and chewy texture which I rather enjoyed... the only thing I may change if I make again is adding walnut and possibly substituting applesauce for oil... great recipes though a little different texture from the fluffy muffin but great oat flavor.

The muffins turned out so fluffy and moist with lots of texture. I added some chocolate chips (if you like walnuts, etc. I'm sure they can be added too). I found this recipe had 1 1/2 cups flour compared to other recipes which had 2 cups, which I think made them lighter, they were amazing!

Tried these w/all whole wheat & raw sugar, but forgot Sarah Jo's suggestion to add a second egg if using all whole wheat. She was right as the muffins were a tad bit heavy (not much, but a noticeable tad). We didn't notice the raw sugar at all. When we noted the heaviness, I wondered out loud how raisins might impact these muffins. I didn't think I would notice the heaviness w/raisins. My son chimed in that w/raisins these would be *perfect*! Two eggs & raisins then, & a touch more spice! The banana oatmeal bread on this site might just need an egg too, but it was even a touch heavier w/whole wheat than these muffins. For now, we are excited about altering this recipe to suit our needs. It is true that the incredible 'confection' of the Banana Crumb Muffins from this site are more of a special treat in our home or a 'show-stopper' to share w/others. However, I can't eat them, which is why I fix whole wheat or spelt muffins when I share those so I'll have *food* to eat myself. As of today, these are my favorite muffins for *nutrition* & *nourishment.* These are good, & are ALL food: Banana! Whole wheat or spelt! Raisins! Oats! Milk of choice (soy next time)! Egg or egg substitute! Raw sugar too, which is filled with minerals that feed the muscles of people w/fibromyalgia like me, so even the sugar is *food* in my book. Oil can be food for some people & we use it some but applesauce is food for anyone; *&* these go great w/my green smoothie! Thanx for a great recipe, Karen!

I have made these muffins many times with no changes at all to the original recipe. The kids love them (me too)! Yesterday, I was making them for a friend who needed gluten-free and all I did was replace the flour with an all-purpose gluten free baking mix (and gluten free oats) and they still turned out great. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This simply delicious banana muffin recipe was great on it's own and an even better basic point to add your own favourite ingredients! I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the oil, 1/4 B. sugar + 1/4 Honey for the 1/2 cup of white sugar and used whole wheat flour, instead of all purpose flour. I also ended up adding: dried blueberries, coconut, chopped pecans, bran fiber & cinnamon! A great and quick breakfast on the go!

Just made the slightly healthier version of these using half whole wheat flour and half white flour, half brown sugar and half white, and unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. I also added 1/4 tsp both cinnamon and nutmeg. They turned out perfectly moist, light, and sweet enough for us, although next time I will use freshly grated nutmeg instead! Thanks for this great, healthy recipe.

This was very good.  I read a bunch of other reviews and substituted several things to make them healthier.  I ground the oats in a coffee grinder (a good idea) I used half and half of all purpose and whole wheat flour, plus one tablespoon for high altitude (it is NOT needed).  I also did half and half on white and brown sugar.  I followed the salt in the recipe and think that it could probably use a whole tsp, without they are a little too sweet.  I used 1%milk and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  I used 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and think that I would go for a whole tsp next time.  I used 3 medium bananas as suggested and that was a perfect amount.  One I had in the freezer and was black on the outside and the other 2 were just overripe on the counter.  It was really easy to defrost the frozen banana (I soaked in very warm water to defrost, don't microwave) but I made sure to drain the extra liquid before mixing with the other bananas.  The flavor of my muffins was really great.  I did add cinnamon at the end and would add more the next time.  My muffins needed a little more of something to make the muffins slightly more moist.  They weren't dry, but just didn't have the perfect consistency I was looking for.  I think I will use a whole cup of milk next time.  The recipe fills 12 muffin tins perfectly to end up with that beautiful height.

Very disappointing.  Very bland (and I added chocolate chips too) and a weird texture.  They kind of feel like they're not fully cooked but they are.  Sorry but won't make again.

I used all whole wheat flour, halved sugar to 1/4 cup, used 2 eggs, 2.5 ripe bananas and added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  These were done quickly (~14mins) so keep a close eye if subbing ingredients.  Very moist and tasty.  A good substantial muffin that not only tastes good but is pretty healthy.  I will definitely make again when I have bananas past their prime!

Very moist with good banana flavor. It had a little too much salt for our taste. I keep using this recipe for my over ripe bananas. Good, healthy snack. I also used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour as someone else suggested.

Wow! These muffins smell delicious. They fluffed up more than some other muffins I have tried and were super moist. I substituted oil for plain yoghourt and added 1 tsp of cardamon seeds. Yummy

These were a hit with the whole family! I used all whole wheat flour, and added 1/2 c. chopped pecans and a sprinkle of cinnamon. They were only a little crumbly, I assume, due to the flour substitution, but kept their moistness thru to the next day. They didn't last longer than that.

Tastey! Changed it up a little to my tastes. I used 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar. I used 1/3 cup melted butter and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Was moist and flavorful! Thanks for sharing your ideas everyone!

I like the idea of making the traditional banana muffin even healthier I just didn't find the taste had much of a punch to it.  You can taste that they are healthy!

This recipe made great muffins. I used half whole wheat flour, and half AP flour. I also used half brown and half white sugar. I added about 3/4 cup chocolate chips, and ended up with 18 small-ish muffins. I really enjoy the texture. Thanks for a keeper of a recipe.

Terrific recipe! After cleaning out my freezer and finding more than a dozen aged and frozen bananas I put this recipe together in no time and my kids love it!  The only changes I made were that I pureed my bananas, and used half white/half brown sugars, and threw in a handful of chocolate chips!   I will try with applesauce, when I have some in the house, though I didn't find them oily. This is a definite make-again!

The overall banana flavor was very good. I would have preferred without oats. If I make these again, I will use some chopped walnuts instead of oats (the oat is a pain to chew - I used steel cut, so it could be my mistake but I have baked with these before and they have been fine).   Also - these muffins were almost overdone for me in 15 mins (around the edges is a little dry). I would say to watch very closely!   All in all, good banana flavor, looked very good - just not a big fan of the oat situation and i feel the baking time was a bit.

Hmm, Well these were healthy, but definitely not particularly tasty. I suppose if you are counting calories, you can go for these.  If you are looking for flavor, try a different recipe.

Great! I like these more and more each day.  I added 1/2 cup flax seed to the batter for a health boost and some nuttiness.  These keep well in the fridge and freeze well, too.

These muffins were amazing! I did make a few changes though:  Instead of white flour I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour  I used more than 1 cup of mashed bananas (I mashed 3)  I added walnuts  Instead of white sugar I used splenda brown sugar and only 1/4 cup of it  I added cinnamon (to taste)  These were moist and delicious, the perfect snack! I will be making these again!

Good but they stick to the muffin papers like crazy. Definitely need a little cinnamon. But I like that they can be pretty healthy- w the applesauce & wheat flour substitutions.

Possibly better with less modifications.  Texture not at all like banana bread, moist but heavy & kinda chewy.  Needs flavor like cinnamon, but would be more bland & bitter without also adding sugar or blueberries, etc.  My mods: added applesauce vs oil per several good reviews, 1/3 of flour as baby wheat cereal (basically wheat flour), powdered milk.  Pretty bland alone, better with cinnamon sugar sprinkled atop before baking, much better with mini chocolate chips; kids loved this way, of course.  Have definately had yummier healthy muffins, bake a lot.

These are great muffins and fit into my healthy lifestyle quite nicely. I used egg beaters, applesauce and a glob of plain yogurt in the batter. I tried to eat one about an hour after I made them and it stuck to the paper liner pretty bad.  The next day however it came off just fine.

Good moist sugarless, very easy to prepare, don’t get tired of eating. They do get stuck to the paper liner (easier to remove once they are completely cool) I may try to spray the liner before pouring in the batter next time. Thank you Karen

I converted this recipe to gluten free by substituting Mama's Gluten Free Flour Almond Blend for the flour in the recipe.  I have made this several times and sometimes add walnuts or chocolate chips.  Always a hit with friends and family.

These were excellent! I substituted brown sugar for the sugar, applesauce for the oil, and I used 2 egg whites.  I used one ripe banana plus 2 frozen bananas that I defrosted enough to mash. Delish!!

These muffins are so good! Very moist and easy. I did add a little ground cinnamon (1/2 teaspoon). I made 6 large muffins and bake them for 23 mins.

very moist, and quick and easy to make.  I love that you can easily stir by hand and eliminate the need for massive cleanup after whipping out the kitchenaid.

Added chopped nuts and more banana. They were very good, but lacked moisture. Am I doing something wrong? Would make again though...

Loved these muffins!! I used fat free milk so I decided to use at least some oil. So I poured a "splash" of oil into the 1/3 cup measure and topped it off with apple sauce. I also used a quick streusel topping. THey came out moist and very tasty. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars was that the papers didn't peel away from the muffins very well and I lost a lot of muffin to the trash. Next time I'll just bake them in a greased pan.

I did use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and I also substituted apple sauce for the oil and baked them as mini muffins for about 12-15 minutes.  These were very good and my kids love them.  I made a large batch and stick them in the freezer and pull a few out to put in my kids lunches in the morning and by lunch time they are thawed.  My kids think that they are getting a treat and I know that they are extremely good for them!

These are very moist and flavorful.  I also like that they are not too dense.  These are definitely going to be a regular around here.

Very good for healthy muffins! I used almost all whole wheat flour and a mix of brown and white sugar. I also added some chocolate chips and pecans. The oats added a nice texture and the muffins were dense like banana bread but not heavy. I'll try replacing some of the oil with applesauce next time.

Good recipe but it did seem to call for alot of baking soda/powder so to avoid the after taste that some reviewers mentioned, I reduced the amount of baking soda to 3/4tspn only.  I added mini choc chips to half the batter but I felt that the chocolate over-rode the flavour of the bananas and oats and these muffins are better without the choc chips.  I'm not sure I liked the crunchy / chewy texture of the rolled oats against the soft texture of the rest of the muffin so maybe I will try using quick cooking oats next time

These are amazing! I followed the original recipe, but added 3/4 c. chocolate chips and cooked in a loaf pan for approx. 45 min. The texture, flavor, and density of these are the best, I can't stop eating them! Definitely recommend this recipe!

These muffins were very, very good.  I made pretty much the same modifications that everyone else has made.  They taste and look great, I just had a hard time peeling the muffin papers off.  I'd recommend spraying the papers first.

These are very tasty muffins.  I made a couple of changes.  I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil.  They turned out great!

One of the best banana muffin recipes I have ever tried (and I have tried a lot, since I ALWAYS have left over bananas). I followed the recipe exactly, except I used brown sugar instead of white, and I added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. Very moist and tasty muffins, I just ate 2 right out of the oven!!

The taste was missing a little something, I wanted to make the recipe as is but it needs a spice or something. I think next time if i make them I'll add some cinnamon or leave it out and add some chocolate chips.

Good one, but i felt it missed something. It was very easy to make. I did some alterations where i divided the sugar amount between white and brown sugar and add a pinch of cinnamon to the batter.  This reciepe yeilded me 18 medium sized cupcakes so i added some left over chocochips to the extra batter and it tasted great.  I think it needs more oats added, if i will do it again i will add 2 cups of oats so that i get a sense of its taste.

These were good muffins, but I thought they could have used a little more flavor.  I didn't have quite a full cup of bananas, so that may have been the problem.  To make up for it, and to get my sons to eat them, I threw in some chocolate chips.  I will make them again, though I'll probably tweak them to fit our tastebuds.

Yummy. I've made this twice. Once I subbed applesauce for the oil and they were fine. The second time, I used applesauce but also added one tablespoon of oil, and that made it easier to get the muffin papers off. FYI ... you'll need about two and a half small-medium bananas.

These are the perfect breakfast. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white, Applesauce instead of oil and 2 egg whites in place of the one egg and three mashed bananas. They have the prefect about of sweetness and are nice and hearty.

I love these muffins!  Like many reviewers I add walnuts and whatever's on hand--dates or raisins.  They are plenty sweet with less sugar than other recipes and I love the hearty texture of the oats.  I do really like popular banana crumb muffin recipe from this site but have prefered these and continue returning to this recipe.

I needed to use up 2 bananas, so I thought I would try this.  Good texture with the oats.  I made mini muffins and baked for 12 minutes at 350 degrees.  I also added mini chocolate chips and walnuts to half the batter. Pretty good.

Very good muffins! I used 3/4 c. each of white and whole wheat flour, and they came out excellent! When I made them again, I was 1/3 c. short on mashed bananas and improvised with 1/3 c. of mashed strawberries. They came out delicious!

Great recipe! Sometimes the most simple recipes turn out best. I made this with all whole wheat flour, two large bananas, skim milk, a half teaspoon of cinnamon and three tablespoons of golden flax seeds. The muffins were moist and delicious. The whole wheat flavor didn't overcrowd the cinnamon-spicy banana flavor. I'd make these again.

Very good. Added a little extra bannana, a half cup of choc. chips, a half cup of walnuts, and used a 1/2 multi grain breakfast cereal oat type mix in place of 1/2 of the oats. Worked great. I plan to use again, and once again add whatever turns up in the cupboards for supplemental material!

These are good. I just felt they were missing a little something. They are a bit bland. I followed the recipe exactly but these need some tweaking. With that they would get a higher rating but the recipe as written gives dull muffins.

Very good. I would have liked them a bit better if there were more bananas, but I really like bananas. I think I'll probably add another 1/2 cup next time I make them. I used whole wheat pastry  flour and thought it added a lot.

Great texture and taste. I also added wheat flour, brown sugar, aplesauce and cinnamon. I omitted the white flour, white sugar and oil. I will try mini chocolate chips next time.

Fantastic and moist.  I'm not a great baker and din't mess them up.  I did 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown.  I did mostly applesauce with a little oil because I didn't have enough applesauce.  I did 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat.  I didn't add nuts, but definitely will next time.  It will add to the great texture.

I followed some of the other suggestions.  I substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour and applesauce for the oil.  I did add ground flax seed, dried cranberries and chopped walnuts and I used skim milk.  I did not have a problem with sticking but I did not use muffin cup liners.  I thought these muffins were really good and I will be making these a lot.

These were great!  Very light and moist!  Very easy to make with my 5yo & 7yo darlings.  I did throw in 3/4 cup of very fresh, plump blueberries.  After reading the other reviews, I will try replacing some of the AP flour with whole wheat next time.  I'll bet a cup of toasted walnuts would also be excellent in these.

I prepared the recipe exactly as written with probably a tab bit more banana...I mean you can't just mash half a banana.  The muffins are really good.  I rate them a 4-star because I think some tweaks can make them better and more healthy.  I'm going to experiment from here, I just always like to go by the recipe the first time I make anything.  I'm going to try the whole wheat flour and substituting some applesauce for the oil and possibly half brown sugar and white sugar taking some of the suggestions from other reviews then they should be a little less fat and very tasty.  Thank you!

1) Used mini muffin tins w/o paper but oiled ~ should wait a few minutes after removing from oven before removing from pan so they don't stick as much. 2) Used about 3/4 c. brown sugar instead of white. 3) Used only applesauce instead of oil (same amount) 4) Used Coach's Oats instead of quick cooking oats. 5) Used Rice Milk instead of cow's milk as substitute for dairy allergies at our house.  Yum! Would definitely add some cinnamon and nutmeg next time ~ wish I had thought of that earlier!  This is a GREAT way to use up those yucko brown bananas!  :)

These muffins were AWESOME!!!The only problem I had was that they stuck to the paper, but that might have been because I used ERINKR82's modifications, I don't know. They tasted great, though, and I'm sure they will be if you follow the original recipe too!

These muffins we very good and healthier.  I made them with my 2 year old daughter and she had so much fun.  I used half brown and half white sugar, applesauce instead of oil, an extra banana and baked at 375 degrees for 12 mins for mini and 20mins for reg muffins.  They had a nice chewy texture, moist, and not too sweet.  The mixture made 12 mini muffins and 10 reg muffins.  I did find the muffins stuck to the paper muffin cups, maybe if I had used oil, it wouldn't have or next time I will not use the muffin cups.

Moist, not too sweet. Nice texture with the oats. Slightly dense like a bran muffin, not super light and cakey. I ran short on bananas, so I made these with 1/2 c. mashed banana and 1/2 c. peeled and chopped macintosh apple - yummy! They stayed moist for days, even when I put the extras in the refrigerator. With the amount of batter this recipe makes, it looks like the muffins will overflow the 3/4 filled paper-lined muffin tins and make a mess when they rise, but they don't. The finished size and shape was perfect. Although I didn't give the recipe four stars as the best ever, the muffins were better than average and I'd make these again.

very moist and yummy.  Made some substitutions.  Instead of rolled oats, I used steel cut oats.  I took a cup of steel cut oats and little more than a cup of cold water to a pot, brought to a boil then cooled.  I also added some flax seed and dried apricots and cranberries. Since I used steel cut oats, I let the batter sit for 15 minutes in my fridge to help soften up the oats. Really  dense and full of flavor.  Next time I might substitute sugar in the raw and try yogurt instead of the oil.

these were good--just need a bit more sweetness, so maybe a sprinkle of course sugar on top before baking would work. might make them again using the other suggestion of mixing brown & white sugar & see how that comes out. i also used the suggestion of using 1/2 wheat flour, as i love to use it whenever i can.  it was definitely an easy recipe, though, so i like it for that :)

These muffins are fabulous!  I followed some of the other suggestions and used half white, half whole wheat flour.  I also cut the oil in half and added applesauce for the other half.  I added dried cranberries and chocolate chips and my family says they're one of the best muffins they've ever had! Moist with a great texture, I'll make them often for breakfast, snacks, and school lunches.

If you follow this recipe (without making any changes) it really is excellent.  The first time I made them I tried substitions to make them lower fat, and they really weren't as good. This recipe is really pretty healthy as is, anyway.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very moist & wonderful!! We made these with low fat ingredients like applesauce, Splenda, & egg whites. Used a mini muffin pan with a walnut half placed on top. Made 4 24 minis & 4 regular. If my math was right, 2 mini muffins are 2.5 WW points.

Good muffin recipe. We like nuts and raisins, so I added a half cup of each. I also was out of oatmeal, so I used 3 packets of Simple Harvest Apple Cinnamon hot cereal mix.  It turned out great. I agree with the reviewer who said 18 minutes is the perfect time to bake. They really have a beautiful golden color.  I'll do this one again.

I tried this recipe and added 1/2 cup chopped nuts.  It tastes great, but, in other banana muffin recipes foil cups are a must!  They should be used with this recipe also so the muffins don't stick.

Terrific! What a fast and simple recipe. I add a modest amount of chocolate chips and some chopped walnuts, but other than that, I always follow the recipe to a 't'. Thanks for a great go-to recipe for those overripe bananas!

I really liked the addition of rolled oats and while the texture did not bother us, I think if I make them for guests, I would add nuts or dates or something that would distract from the occasional bits of oats. If you didn't know there were rolled oats in them, you might think that the batter was not mixed properly.  I did add an extra 1/4 cup of sugar to make 3/4 total.  The muffins freeze very well.  I will definitely make these often. Thank you for a very good recipe.

Really good and easy. I did 1/2 whole wheat flour butter instead of oil and used more bananas + nuts of course. Kids love 'em. I put banana liqour in all my banana recipes and it really throws some extra flavor to the mix.

This is the exactly what I was looking for! A healthier muffin that uses up my ripe bananas, made with less sugar, and healthy oats.  They baked up beautifully at exactly 18 minutes... were crispy on the outside and moist (but not wet) on the inside and delicious! I will say, that I felt they needed butter/butter spread on them to really enjoy, though. Will make again, maybe adding some cinnamon.

Delicious and easy! Recipe made 16 muffins. Used 1/3 whole wheat flour in place of white, half Splenda in place of sugar, half unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and added about a tablespoon of whiskey.

Marvelous!  To make them healthier, I reduced the oil a tad, replaced sugar with honey and added cinnamon & nutmeg.  They're so moist and light - a new favourite!

The muffins turned out perfect!!  They were not too dense, but not too light and we love the oats in them!  I subsituted applesauce for the oil, used whole wheat flour, added about 1/4 tsp extra vanilla, used dark brown sugar instead of white and I didn't measure out the banana's as I had 3 large ones that needed to be used up so I just used them all.   I run a daycare from home and it's always hard to find something that pleases everyone but this recipe  sure did!!

These muffins were very easy to prepare, and turned out quite delicious.  I liked to eat them warm with butter and cinnamon sugar on them.  I'm considering trying them sometime with a cinnamon streusel on top or maybe just cinnamon-sugaring the pan before baking.

These were wonderful!  Because I was out of white sugar, I used a combination of splenda and brown sugar in it's place.  I also replaced 1/2 cup of the milk with low-fat yogurt.  Oh... and I only used 1/4 cup of oil.  The results were a perfect muffin - very moist with great  flavor and texture!

These were good and I will definately save the recipe to make again.  
I did make several substitutions...1c whole wheat pastry flour for 1c white flour, 2 eggs instead of 1, replaced 1/2 of the oil with ground flax seed, used about  1 1/2 cups banana and cut the by about 2 Tbs.  Thanks!

These are great muffins.  I like that they remain moist and they make a good, quick breakfast on the go.  I make a few modifications to make them more healthy since we make them quite often.  For 12 muffins, I substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour & 1/2 cup ground almond flour (ground in the food processor) for 1 cup of the AP flour.  I also substitute 1/3 cup of applesauce for the oil, then bake at 375 for 20-24 minutes.

Could not improve on this recipe.  Moist, tasty muffins that came out great and were easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly other than that my two bananas made for just a teeny bit less than one cup.

Healthy, yet good... paradox? None of my co-workers could tell that this was the healthier version of the usual banana nut muffins. Thanks! I will be making this often. **UPDATE: Only use very ripe bananas, or it'll turn out yucky..

These came out really well! I used egg whites, skim milk, apple sauce, and organic wheat flour. In half of the batch I added blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries in the batch, and they came out great too.

These had a great texture and flavor, but they don't necessarily look too appealing.  They also were best the first or second day, they didn't keep well past that.

Wow, these are GREAT! A little too crumbly for my two-year-old to eat but they taste great, are moist and cakey, and came out of the oven perfectly timed and browned! Definitely a new favorite.

Now, I've been known to eat a whole loaf of banana bread in one sitting so I decided muffins might be a better idea this time around. These are so good! I used 1/4 cup slpenda, same amount of unsweetened applesauce for the oil, skim milk, 1tsp of cinnamon and one small red apple (forgot what kind) peeled, cored, and choped pretty small.  Mine turned out done after 18 min at 350.  Next time I think I will add 1/3 c walnuts and play around using some honey. Will make again!

This was a good base recipe.  I used half a cup of plain yogurt and a quarter cup of milk, 1/3 cup of butter instead of the oil, 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white and added 1/4 tsp orange rind, 1/8 tsp allspice and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to up the flavour impact.

Moist and fluffy!  I liked they weren't real sweet as well.  It seemed as though there was a little of a bitter after taste, like there was too much baking powder.  I will try it with less next time.

I made these muffins as a healthy snack for my son's preschool class.  The first thing he said to me as he ran out the doors of his school was "Mom, everyone loved your muffins!"  I thought they lacked a little flavor, but over all they were pretty good.

Good with raisins and a bit of cinnamon! I did them at 350 degrees rather than 400 and they turned out perfect.

I've tried many of the healthier/lower fat versions of banana muffins.  This being one of the best.  I did use half whole wheat and half non bleached white flour as well as large flake oats.  Great texture and just enough sweetness.  Will keep this one in the favorites file.

Very good base recipe. I also played with the basics. I pulsed the oats in my Cuisinart first, substituted 1/2 cup wheat flour for some of the white, scalded the milk and used brown sugar. Also, I put in a 1/2 cup of chopped hazel nuts  since I had them on hand. Very good!

This is a wonderful recipe & kids love it. Thanks so much for sharing it. I use melted butter instead of vegetable oil and add cinnamon. Because I ran out of rolled oats the first time I made it, I used 1/2 cup flaxseed meal & 1/2 cup oatmeal. Worked great. Also, I bake them at 325, not 400 degrees -- maybe my oven just runs hot.

These muffins are going in my recipe box for sure.  Used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose and only 1/4 cup oil.  Perfect.  Everyone loves them.

These were just ok..thought they could have been a little sweeter in my book. They took about 22-26 minutes to cook and they made 18 instead of 12. I wont make them again.

I followed the recipe on these and they turned out wonderful. The batter was a bit thin and it made 17 muffins instead of 12, but they are very moist and not overly sweet. This is a recipe that I will keep and make again.

I doubled the recipe, using 1 cup of whole wheat flour, a bit less vegetable oil than the recipe called for, and about 3/4 cup of sugar instead of one full cup. Came out deliciously!

These were very light and fluffy and I had used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purp. flour.  I had to substitute buttermilk out of necessity.  The only other thing I added was 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Very nice for breakfast, but my only complaint is that these are not sweet enough.  I had 3 black bananas which gave it a wonderful flavor.  I think the buttermilk helped in the fluffiness.  Very healthy but would want strictly for breakfast due to the lack of sweetness.

Definitely a hit!  These muffins taste great, and they are not to sweet, so they really do make a great breakfast muffin.  I made a few little changes to the second batch that I just made: added some cinnamon and substituted apple sauce for the oil. Thanks for a great recipe!

These muffins are amazing, and for the taste, amazingly healthy.  I can't believe  how good they are.  I modified the recipe by cooking the muffins at 325 degrees for about 20 minutes, which cooks the inside of the muffins better.  Also, instead of using  1 1/2 cups of white flour, I used one cup of white flour and 1/2 cup of oat flour, which just makes it healthier.  Thanks!

These muffins are really good! They baked up perfect in 18 minutes and were so moist on the inside but the out side was slightly cruchy, I topped them with a little oat and brown sugar stuesel, very tasty.

We thought these were really good, although not quite as sweet as we would have liked (next time I would add a touch more sugar, and maybe some honey for flavor as well as sweetness). I personally really liked the oaty texture - it gave the muffins a healthier, more nutricious feel. I thought that the amount of veg oil called for sounded a little excessive, so I just used a slosh of olive oil. Great recipe. Thanks, Karen!

These were nice and easy but didn't get gobbled up the way some other muffin recipes have. I didn't have the applesauce that was suggested by others so I added 1/2 a cup of pumpkin puree. They were moist but there was some flavour missing.

Overall, I really like these muffins, although they are a bit on the dry side (not much, so don't let that dissuade you).  I'm thinking if you added apple sauce in addition to the oil, that would help (and I am going to try that on the next batch).

Moist and chewy for a low-fat recipe, maybe just a little spongey at worst!  I added a teaspoon cinnamon and substituted the oil with cinnamon applesauce.  I think next time I'll add more banana in place of the applesauce/oil for more flavour.  Nice.

This was a great recipe. I substituted the milk with Silk Extreme Vanilla soymilk and used an Omega 3 egg. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and the bananas were almost still frozen when I mixed them together. I added 1 tsp. of ground golden flaxseed and I also added about 1/4 C of milk chocolate chips. Great snack for me and the kids. They were moist and delicious and made 2 dozen. Enjoy & thanks!

These are delicious! I even "doctored" them a bit by adding walnuts and chocolate chips. I made 6 huge muffins and they are fabulous!

Omygosh, I absolutely love these muffins!  They're so good, and moist and just all around yummy.  The oatmeal does make the muffins stick to the liners...but it's all worth it.  I added some cinnamon topping on top and it made it really good.

As soon as these were out of the oven and semi-cooled there were 4 missing.  My 15 year old son thought they were great.  They were light and fluffy, great texture and flavor.  The only change from the original recipe was maybe 1/2 cup chocolate chips and instead of vanilla i used almond flavoring, which gave it a traditional bannan bread flavor.  This is a definite keeper.

these were really yummy. i replaced the milk with yogurt, added extra banana (about an extra 1/2 cup), some cinnamon and nutmeg and brown sugar. they were the perfect sweetness and had a really good banana flavour. my only criticism is that i couldn't really taste the oatmeal at all. also, these muffins do not rise - when i took them out they appeared to have risen, but then sunk again! they still taste great though, and most importantly are very moist.

This recipe was ok but it wasent reaily what I was looking for. I did change it a little by adding cinamon and nutmeg and using applesauce in place of the oil.  I will keep looking.

Very good muffins!! They are moist and have a great banana flavor. I made some substitutions: stone ground whole wheat flour, brown sugar, soy milk, applesauce, and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top before baking. Made 36 mini muffins.

This is a good recipe that makes twelve good size muffins. Next time I will double the sugar and use quick cooking oats instead of regular. They were very moist and light.

I was not happy with how these turned out...I will probably not make them again, even with alterations.  My husband finished them all off (not that he liked them either, but we didn't want to waste them).

I like how large these muffins come out.  The oats give it a bit more texture but the taste remains nearly the same.  My 3 kids thought they were fantastic.  The only substitution I made was half wheat flour.  These were much better than the weight watcher version I tried the day before.

A nice banana muffin that isn't too sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly; they took the full time to bake for me (which is unusual in our oven).  If oats and banana sounds like a good combination to you, give this a try...otherwise, move along!

These muffins turned out really good.  I was very happy with this recipe.  I got 8 nice-sized muffins and they barely lasted 24 hours - and there was just my husband and myself eating them!

I enjoyed the texture of these muffins.  They were not that sweet in taste, but had a different taste for banana muffins that I and my whole family enjoyed....

I made these for a playgroup of toddlers and their mothers.  They ate them up!  I love the texture that is achieved with the oatmeal.
