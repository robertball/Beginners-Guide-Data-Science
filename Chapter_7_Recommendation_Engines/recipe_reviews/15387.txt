Try swapping the NDC for soy or rice milk.  5 stars if you do....You can up the creamy effect by boiling down 2-3 cups to 1 cup of soy milk.  Then add it to the recipe.  You can also add instant mashed potato flakes to make it creamy OR try using soy cream cheese and thin to your likeness with unsweetened soy milk.

Tried this recipe as is,did not like it.I found the potatoes mushy,and there really wasn't much taste.IMO it does not need 2 hours to cook.So i tried it again with a little tweeking.I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth on medium heat till not quite cooked about 10 min.Then i added 1/2cup peas, 1cup chopped celery,1 cup chopped carrots,1cup green onion,2cups corn and a bit of garlic.I added 1 cup of Silk Milk,fresh parsley,little salt and pepper,and simmered till cooked,all was done from chopping the veggies.till cooked in a little over 1 hour.By adding the Silk it gave the soup a bit more body,so i will make it again.

I liked it but hubby said it was okay. It's a great alternative since I can't have much dairy but I did end up putting in about 2 Tb of butter. I also used lactose free milk instead of non dairy creamer. I would it it again but I just want to know how to get more if the corn taste.

I have been vegan since July of 2012 and I look for great recipies that fit my vegan diet.  This one was great!  I changed out water in the potatoes for vegetable broth and non dairy creamer of plain almond milk with nothing added to the milk.  Good comments from my non vegan family.
