Not sure what happened, but this does NOT make 6 servings! This was my main dish, but barely enough for 2. I had to add sun dried tomatoes, and sliced toasted almonds, to try to stretch it out for my family.  
The flavor was good....next time lots more kale....it really shrinks down.

Very tasty even without the parmesan!  I cut back the amount of butter which I think helped but will definitely cook this again.

I really enjoyed this. My husband and kids weren't thrilled with it but I'm not really counting their opinion on this one. I did use almonds instead of pine nuts.

Very good. I added garlic and onions because I love those 2 ingredients. Kale was really tasty and a nice change of a veggie side dish. Thanks for a simple and tasty recipe!

i made no alterations to the ingredients. i liked it as is and will make it again. my only issue is that i did not get 6 servings. maybe kale bunches vary in size, but 2 of us ate this as a side dish and it was all gone. i might cover the pan while cooking the kale next time, my kale was still a little tough. also, i don't see the point of tossing the ingredients together in a separate bowl - i did it all in the skillet.

This was my first time cooking kale and this recipe was simple and let the kale shine.  I did use about half the butter called for in the recipe and omitted the parmesan (because we were also having macaroni and cheese).  Although my 7 year-old said it was "chewy," she liked it.

First time trying Kale.  I am not sure if I didn't cook it long enough (a bit tough).  Also, I didn't use 1/4 cup butter.  I used half butter and half "I can't believe it's not butter".  A bit salty too, forgot the parmesan cheese would add saltiness to the dish (so go easy with the salt).  I will try this again and will use only butter because, indeed, everything taste better with butter.  ;)

I cut out some of the butter as well and didn't add cheese (not a big fan of parmesan anyway) and, oh my... this was delicious! The smell got my mouth watering. I'll be making this for some friends next week and I'm sure they'll love it!

This is not 6 serving. Double the recipe if it is more than two people. Instead of butter I used a teaspoon of olive oil and chicken broth.

Healthy and tasty.  Be sure to stir the kale while cooking to avoid scorching.  Next time, I will sautee onion and garlic prior to adding the kale for a more robust side dish.

Did it according to the recipe. It's the best kale I have made based reviews from my family.

Probably my fault, but I used too much butter and they were pretty much gross. I'm going to try a different kale recipe.
