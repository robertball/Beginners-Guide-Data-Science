Tried every French Onion Soup on this site and this is the best.  I left out the wine and added 2 tsp beef boullion.  Other than that I made this exactly ad written and was thrilled with the results.  Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe. The only problem I had was I bought 5 regular size white onions and only needed 3 of them. That was plenty! I used sherry as the white wine. I really liked this because it was sweet, not salty. I used a mix of provolone, mozzarella, and fresh romano on the bread.

This soup was the best ever.  My husband has asked me to make it four more times since I've first tried it.  Its VERY easy. I added the wine to the onions as they were sauteing, it seemed to add more flavor. I used mozzarella cheese. My parents loved it also.  Better than any restaurant.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This was my first try at FOS... and it was fantabulous! I watched the video posted on this website before attempting it and I combined the two recipes. I heated up some olive oil and butter in a dutch oven, added the onions and sauteed until golden brown. Added wine and cooked until the alcohol burned off. Added sugar and tossed until well coated. Added beef broth, covered and simmered for 20 minutes. Added salt and pepper to taste and continued simmering for 10 more minutes. Poured soup into bowls, added bread and covered with 2 slices of swiss cheese. Broiled until cheese melted and served. YUM!

All I can say is YUM!!!!  I absolutely love French Onion soup, and never dreamed I could make it myself.  I discovered this about 2 months ago and have made it 4 times since.  I actually take french bread and tear it into pieces and put it in the bottom of the bowl before adding the soup.  Also, I use deli sliced provolone cheese on top.  Just thinking about this is making me want to go home and make it tonight (even though I just made it three nights ago!).

This recipe is fabulous!  I only added a clove of garlic while the onions were sauteing and a beef bullion cube to the broth!  Thanks Lance, I can't wait to make it again and again!

A nice recipe, but I don't use beef broth, so I wanted to find a deeper flavor while avoiding the beef.  I will try chicken broth next time, but this time I made a variation for a vegetarian friend with vegetable broth.  

I used only 1 1/2 large white onions, which was plenty of onion.  Upon tasting it, I both thought it was missing something and I did not think that the sugar was necessary, as the soup tasted a little sweeter than I would have liked it, so I added a pinch of dried thyme and a pinch of dried parsley along with the salt and pepper. In the future, I might leave the sugar out.

The wine was a very nice addition.  I added 1/2 cup to the onions after they were tender, let it mostly bubble away, and then also added 1/2 cup of wine to the broth at the step indicated in the recipe.

Finally, I made the French bread a few days in advance and toasted them in olive oil, butter, and garlic in a pan on the stove to make them into croutons before adding them to the soup.  

I grated swiss and smoked gouda together.  Yum.

Thanks for the recipe! This was a quick supper good for a late night movie with friends.

I tried this recipe tonight and was very pleasantly surprised at how easy and delicious it was. It's as good as any that I've had in any resturant. The only changes that I made was to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, no salt, only pepper and I used garlic powder. The wine that I used was Marsala. Excellent recipe, I will definately be making this again and again!

Delicious - I find myself making this just for me during the middle of the week... I do add a dash of worcestershire, and omit the white sugar, and I carmelize my onions with brown sugar and add the white wine to that.

This soup was great. I used a packaged grated cheese that included Parmasan, Provolone and Swiss, and placed a large handful on top of each bowl.

Overall I thought this was a very good recipe. I was looking for something a little more complex in flavor however it is a great place to start. I added thyme and dried parsley and used Gruyere rather than swiss.

Delicious! French onion soup is one of those things that I try everywhere I go in hopes of finding "the best" and this recipe is awesome! The only changes I made were to only use 3 onions, and used half Marsala wine and half Sherry in place of the white wine - I like my soup a little sweeter so this was perfect for me. I also didn't have swiss cheese so I used sliced provolone. It was ok, but I'm still in search of the perfect cheese topping. All in all this is a fantastic recipe and very easy to whip up at home when I have a craving for it.

Lance's French Onion Soup was great.  I made it for my son and his wife for lunch.  I guess my son really liked it.  He ate 3 bowls.  I added a bit of garlic and because I did not have any beef stock, I used bovril and added a bit more water.  It was delicious, and I will certainly make it again.  Colleen - Ontario Canada

My boyfriend loves French Onion Soup so I decided to make it for him.   This recipe was spot on.  The only change was adding four beef boiillon cubes and letting it cook in a slow cooker all afternoon.  He said it was the best he ever had and trust me, that is a huge compliment since he orders this all the time when we go out.  I saved this recipe to my Favorites!

Great recipe! I made a few adjustments: Since my beef broth was homemade, I added 2 sprigs of {fresh} Thyme and Parsley in the broth after the onion had been added. I also added 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup Marsala wine. My family liked that I used Gruyere cheese! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I loved the recipe, but did make a few changes. I used 64oz of beef broth, 2&1/2 tsp beef bouillon, and used a mixture of shredded Swiss, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. I also omitted the wine. I used a mixture of 3 sweet and 2 yellow onions. It was sweet enough that I could have left out the sugar. Yummy soup that had my husband going back for thirds!

Great soup! Only used three onions. Also, the beef broth cooked down, so I will add an additional two more cups next time. Easy and fantastic!

Great flavor, even the kids liked it.  It was a bit salty but I attribute that to the broth I used.  Will definitely make this again.

Let me start with the statement that my fiance doesn't like french onion soup. He agreed to try this version, and has actually asked me to make it again... I don't put the bread on top of the soup, but I do put in plenty of cheese and we have bread to dip on the side. I find it a bit sweet, even without the sugar, so may try to find a wine thats not so sweet the next time. But it is still a quick, easy meal that reheats well.

There is a particular way to make FO soup.   Why is no one caramelizing the onions?  That is where a lot of flavor comes from.  We use Better Than Bouillon Beef stock paste and it is the best (no MSG).   Look up how to caramelize onions because there is a particular way to do it for success.  I am giving 3 stars for effort and subtracting two for not performing due diligence.

I was looking for an easy not too many ingredients  recipe and found this one.  I tried it because of the star rating.   Wow!!!  This is so easy and the taste is amazing!!!   Before cooking, I read some of the other reviews for hints and tips.  One recommend adding the wine to the onions as they were cooking so I did that.  I used a pinot grigio(Barefoot actually) since the recipe only calls for half a cup that means I could drink the rest of the bottle! No wine goes to waste in my kitchen.  Anyway.....I'm not a fan of swiss cheese so I used an Italian blend of shredded cheeses.  I sliced a loaf herbed french bread, crisped that in the oven, sprinkled on the cheese and popped it under the broiler for a minute.  Laddled soup in bowls, added a bit of cheese, then placed a slice of the cheesy bread on top.  So delicious, quick,easy and best of all TASTY!!!  My family loved it!  I will definitely be making this again.

Very good - I would use less wine (personal taste) and use more onions next time. I used half butter and half olive oil to sautee the onions and it was still delicious.

We loved this soup! The only changes we made were using olive oil instead of vegetable oil and using gruyère cheese instead of swiss cheese. Both of those changes were personal preference. It is mild but you can taste all the different flavors. We make a lot since we have about 2 bowls each!

The best French onion soup - ever! This is so easy, so quick and so tasty. Wife is a french onion soup lover and does not crave restaurant FO soup anymore!  I only recommend half as much bread if you actually want to drink any soup.

Wow!!  This recipe was fab!  I added 2 cloves of garlic when satueeing the onions, as well as 1/2 pound of fresh mushrooms.  And, I used red white instead of white, as well as 2 Tbsp. of ground, dried basil. My husband RAVED about it!!!!  Will definitely make again!!

I used 3 1/2 onions, sauteed it in olive oil until it was close to transparent, then added the sugar. Added the wine (chardonnay) and when it was thoroughly clear, used a 32oz box of beef broth (that scaled it down to about 4 servings rather than 6). Then added salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne for some kick to it. I also toasted the bread before I put it into the soup and used deli sliced (reduced fat) provolone cheese as the topper. Garnished with sliced green onions on top of the cheese. Popped it in the microwave and voila! Looks wonderful and tastes SOOOO GOOODDD!!!! Thanks again!

So good! I added Fontina shredded cheese as well, but even without this would have been a 4 star. i just wish there was a way to keep the bread from turning SO soggy.

This is so yummy!!  And so incredibly easy to make!!  The only thing I added was some garlic because everything, in my humble opinion, tastes better with garlic!  Oh and I think I let the onions cook a bit longer than the translucent stage - some had a touch of carmelized color but I think that just adds to the overall flavor!!
Thanks Lance!

This is soup had excellent flavor. Both my husband and I loved it. The only changes I might make are using one less onion, or more broth. Also, I might use a different type of cheese on top. The swiss cheese got a little lumpy and was difficult to break apart to eat with the soup. Overall..awesome!

Right on!  I made this a few days ago... I omitted the sugar - and I added two beef bullion cubes to the beef broth for a ramped-up beef flavor.  I also used a shredded blend of Swiss and Gruyere found at T.J.'s, which was fabulous.  I've made several different recipes for French Onion Soup over the years - including some much more complicated & involved than this one - and this one is as good as it gets.  I will use this recipe again, with my slight modifications.  Thanks, Lance!

Excellent French onion soup.  I used less oil and butter to cut the fat calories and it still was great.  A little confused on the amount of onion, since the vary in size so much.  I used 5 cups sliced and it was just right for my tastes.  I also added 1/2 tsp thyme and a bay leaf and 1 clove crushed garlic.  Yum.

This is a simple, basic soup recipe that leaves itself open to all kinds of tweaking.  The sugar was unnecessary but a clove or two of garlic is a must-have.  My tweaks also included a bit of ground red pepper, celery seed, and white pepper.  A dash of Worcestershire or Maggi will be added next time I make this.  When I served it, I simply grated some fresh Parmesan on top (no bread, trying to cut carbs) and it was a pleasant, earthy taste to the sweet onions.

i know it's french onion, but it did seem to have too much onion if that's possible, i think i'd cut down on the number of onions i use or the size next time.

Fantastic! The only modifications I made were to use a gluten free broth and then broiled it with just the cheese to make it a gluten free recipe, fantastic flavor. Next time I wll try it with some homemade gluten free bread to see how it works out, but it is great with just the cheese.

I didn't follow it to the T - I didn't heat the broth on a separate pan, I just poured it right in. I also used butter instead of vegetable oil because that's what I had in hand. I used a normal drinking white wine that I had from my friends hanging out at my place. To be honest, I haven't had french onion soup for about 5 years I don't really remember what it's suppose to taste like. I was happy with what I got though! I didn't do the topping part, I just got bread and dipped it (cheese and butter was spread on the toasted wheat bread) like I used to back at a restaurant I used to goto. It was still really good. I'm glad I found another use for my wine!

The was so easy and tasted just as good as ANY restaurant's French Onion soup! I used a blend of asiago, mozzarella, and provolone cheeses for the bread but only because I am not a fan swiss cheese. I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again!

I used one less onion and some garlic artisan bread with deli sliced swiss cheese on top. I have to saw that my husband was in awe, and all his coworkers were jealous when he took it for lunch the next day!!! The aroma was all over the lunch room. This is one of the best french onion soups I have had, and I give this a 10 stars, because 5 just didn't complete how good this is!!!! Thanks again!! This is going into my Recipe rotation. :-)

I needed my daily soup fix to be quick and easy today - I've got a cold, and feel bleh - so when I saw this reviewed this morning, I thought I'd give it a go. I've tried a couple of way more complicated FOS recipes in the past, and they were nowhere near as good as this. The only thing I changed was to add a couple of bouillon cubes to beef it up a little, and I've just realized I forgot the sugar. Oopsie... Anyway, thanks so much, Lance!

My french onion soup connoisseur boyfriend gives this a 5 star rating.  So do I!  I did tweak the recipe somewhat.  I only used 3 large red onions, 3 (14.5 oz) cans beef broth, and used 2 teaspoons of sugar.  I sliced fresh French bread, toasted it first and then soaked both sides in the broth.  Instead of Swiss, I used deli sliced Muenser cheese.  The white wine really made the difference.  Thanks so much!  Will be making this for my parents at a family get together this weekend.

Awesome recipe... it the sweetness of the sugar and the wine really contrasted well with the broth and the onions... the cheese and the bread really went well with the wine. A+++ recipe

This was awesome!  The only change I made was to use sherry instead of white wine and I added a little more than called for.  I used a combination of sweet and yellow onions.  My family loved it and wondered why it took me so long to make it.  Thank you for the recipe.  Side note: It was cold here in Houston (30's) so it was the perfect night to have it.  Sharing with friends!

So easy to make. I used 1 super large sweet yellow onion and followed the rest of the direction exactly and it was delicious. I saved the recipe and will make it again!

Excellent quick fix.  Taste was great without the time it takes in other recipes.  I just had sliced white cheese in the fridge instead of shredded swiss.  I also added some parmesan cheese on the top before putting in the oven and it gave a tender golden look to the already pretty colored broth.

Delicious and not too salty! I didn't have bread but I had croutons that I would normally use for Caesar salad so I used those instead and it turned out great.

My poor husband had the flu and I decided to make Lance's French Onion Soup instead of my usual go to cold and flu soup, the Quick and Easy Chicken Noodle Soup, also from Allrecipes. The onion soup was a big hit with my husband  and me. My husband said it was the best onion soup he'd ever tasted and it's rich flavor helped ease his stuffy nose! I made the recipe almost as directed adding only a teaspoon of minced garlic to the onions. I will be making this recipe often,  and not just when someone has a cold.

I used this recipe in my cooking class. Everyone had a part to do. We omitted the sugar and used red wine instead of white .We also used mozzarella instead of swiss cheese as there is a big difference in cost. The flavour was amazing. I usually don't follow a recipe when I make my soup but needed one for the class. This turned out perfect with a few little changes.

This soup is the best onion soup in my opinion. The flavor is better than a restaurant's. I like that it requires red wine. So, I just add the amount needed in the recipe and then consume the rest while I am making the soup and Dinner. Amazing soup! A must try. I have been making it for years.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I made a double batch for a group of about  10 people.  It was more than enough.  The only thing I would change is if you do double the recipe, you could use about 7-8 medium size onions instead of 10 like I did!!

Very easy and pleases the most picky eater in my house. Anytime I can find something my wife likes I make it often. Omitted the wine just because I didn't have any but can't wait to add it in next time.

Very very good and quite easy.  Has a little more taste than the standard onion soup.  I followed it exactly.  The onions I used were quite large, so it had a LOT of onions, which didn't bother us at all.  Thank you for sharing!

We really enjoyed this soup. I made this in a casserole dish that is 9" X 9" since my smaller bowls were not broiler proof.  I toasted the French bread as someone else suggested, cut it into cubes and placed it in the bottom of the casserole. I also sauteed mushrooms with the onions. I like mushrooms in most dishes!  I used part mozzarella cheese and part Swiss cheese. I will make this recipe again.

French onion soup is my all time favorite soup. So, I've been searching everywhere for the perfect recipe and I must say this tastes just perfect! Sadly I'm not of the age to purchase the wine so I had to just go without, but it still turned out amazing. I can only imagine what it tastes like when you actually add it in. I also let it simmer for about 45 minutes instead of 20 so that the broth got more of the onion flavor that my family loves. And then I used sliced provolone cheese rather than shredded Swiss so that I got the perfect stringyness. My husband had 3 bowls to himself! We will definitely be making this more often!!

I made it exactly according to the recipe  - except because I'd use beef boulion cubes for the broth that are salty I added NO salt.
It was GREAT.   I will make it again and again...  EASY!

Use deep red wine instead of white. More robust flavor. I also add 3 T of worchestshire sauce.

I am a novice cook and this is the first time I've ever made French onion soup.  I'm pretty picky about this kind of soup and it turned out AMAZINGLY!! It was easy to make and full of flavor.   You can't get that taste out of a can!

Since I am avoiding bread and cheese, I  wanted more substance in my onion soup. I sauted 1 cup of sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup of  chopped green onion, 1 cup of sliced celery, and 1 sliced large white onion in the butter and oil. I added 1/2 a cup of sherry and a little worcestershire sauce to the vegetables. I cut the amount of sugar in half but still added the white wine to the soup. I call this drunken onion soup! My husband loved it. He said that it is better than the onion soup at a nice restaurant. I'm going to use the leftover soup as a starter for elk stew tomorrow evening.

Loved this recipe. I tried hard to find a recipe with brandy in it. I've been told french onion soup is not done right without a shot of brandy. After making this recipe twice, I very much have to disagree. The white wine in this recipe adds a lot of flavor. It's a very easy, simple recipe that cooks up fast and tastes delicious. I like a more brothy soup so only went with 3-4 onions which was plenty. Still tons of onion in each serving. And I use a slice of provolone cheese instead of swiss. Just personal preference. Great recipe! Will be making it over and over.

This was excellent! I had sweet onions, plus added the sugar called for in the recipe, so it was a tad too sweet. But my family loved it and I will definitely make it again.

My family loved this soup. Even my kids who normally won't touch onions, liked it. I did leave out the wine, but I don't know that it made much difference. I have made a couple of different versions of French Onion Soup including some with a combination of chicken and beef broth, but this is my favorite! Thanks for the great recipe.

I love this recipe! I used large thick pieces of buttered, toasted French bread, and Antonio Gelisi white wine. My bread stole all the broth and I was left with a huge soaked piece of bread, which some would love, but next time I will use a smaller piece, or serve it on the side. I pureed about half of the onions before adding the broth, just to thicken, and to hide the evidence from my grandkids, lol. I added too much broth, so I boiled it down, added some onion powder and lots of pepper. I melted provolone on top of the French bread and soup, like a restaurant I went to years ago. The provolone was a bit of a fight though. Will try the swiss and smoked gruyere like another rater. This recipe is superb, and so simple!

This is absolutely superb!  I try very hard to review the original recipe but didn't have white win and can't afford to go buy some so used red instead which gave it a great full-bodied taste.  Since the original recipe doesn't state what size of onions to use, I used large which gave a LOT of onions versus the amount of broth.  It was delicious as is but I'll likely adjust that a bit next time.  I made both the "Basic Beef Stock" recipe by Wolverine and "Italian Bread Using Bread Machine" by Destiny which were great as well.

So ridiculously simple yet SO GOOD!! Only two little changes - I added a bit of wine while cooking the onions (everything's better with more wine, right?), and I didn't add sugar to the onions. I used yellow onions and they ended being sweet enough on their own. Made some homemade croutons and added the cheese and OH MY GOD so good! I made this as an appetizer before a 9 hour pot roast... pot roast came out fine, but I would've been happy with just the soup :)

Yummy. I used a piece of texas toast instead of the french bread. The flavor of the broth was not as "beefy" in flavor as I would have liked. This can be related to the broth that I used.  This is still yummy and I will make it again.

Had left over french onion roast I had made the day before and never made french onion soup. I used the juice and onions left over from the roast and added beef stock and onions. This was quite easy and instead of wine I used beer. I will be making again love,love, love recipes that let me use my leftovers.

Best french onion soup I have ever had, and I've had a lot. I love french onion soup. I didn't have any bread when I made it, so I used seasoned croutons (the kind that come in a bag - the big ones - I think they were cheese flavored?). Anyway - it was AMAZING! I think I'll only use croutons from now on. I put them in and poured the onions and broth over them. Also, I loved that the croutons were perfect spoon-sized, so no need to cut up the bread. Used regular yellow onions and italian blend shredded cheese. It was unbelievable....serve with texas toast (with cheese of course), a glass of red wine and a roaring fire in the fireplace. Perfection!

Good, solid french soup recipe that is easy to customize to your family's liking.  I cut the fat in this recipe (I often do with a good non-stick pan).  I used 1 tablespoon each of EVOO and light butter.  It took about 45 minutes for my onions to caramelize and then I added the wine. Since I used a sweeter white, I did not add the sugar.  Once the wine reduced (about 10 minutes), I added the beef broth, salt and pepper.  After simmering for about 20 minutes I tasted.  The flavor was good, but not quite flavorful enough for me.  So I added about a tablespoon of resh thyme and a teaspoon of beef crystals.  Although this was tasty, I'll try another recipe next time.  Thanks for sharing.

It has been a long time since I have made French onion soup.  This recipe filled the bill, when I had many onions leftover from a luncheon.  One guest had never tried French onion soup.  He loved it.  Thanks.

It was good.  Hit the spot.  I made them in individual ramekins.  I burned the cheese on two of them because I started watching tv instead of the food.  Peeled it off and started over and they all came out great.  Thanks.

I made this two different ways, the original recipe for my carnivorous husband and with veggie stock for my herbivore daughter. They both loved it and said not to change a thing. Thanks Lance!

This recipe is very easy to make and has a wonderful taste.  We altered using provolone cheese instead of swiss and found it to add a little more flavor.  If you are a baked onion soup fan, this recipe is for you.

Excellent Recipe!  I always double the recipe using sweet vidalia onions...usually about 5 large ones.  I don't care much for the flavor of Swiss cheese, so I substitute  with shredded mozzarella.  My whole family loves this soup!

This was good. After I had sliced 4 onions I stopped as that seemed like plenty and it was. Next time I would add a little more beef broth to give a stronger beef flavor, but overall, this was very good and my husband loved it.

It came out good, but not as I'd hoped.  I used half red onions and half sweet onions because I wasn't sure what to use.  Seems like it's missing something, but it also could be because this was my first attempt to make this soup.

This is one of the best french onion soup recipes I've ever made!  I made it vegetarian with some veggie broth for my roommate and it came out really delicious.
