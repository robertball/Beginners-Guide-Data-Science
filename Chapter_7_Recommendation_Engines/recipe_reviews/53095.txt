This is incredibly easy to make. I've been making a variation of this for years. I like to add cooked cellophane noodles for an interesting texture.  Also I'll add some green onions, a dash of sugar, a little minced garlic, and a dash of soy sauce to make it extra tasty. This is a salty dish that balances well with jasmine rice.

This is an excellant recipe!  My kids love this dish!  It is great with a little Thai hot sauce on the side.  I serve it with a brothy soup and lots of white rice.  So delicious, you should try it.

I like this recipe because it's quick, easy, uses fish sauce, and tastes great!  It was VERY salty, though - I would reduce the fish sauce to 1.5 or 2 T - and definitely have something bland, like rice, to eat with it.

So easy and delicious!  I sauteed some sliced onions and garlic in the pan before I added the egg mixture.  Wonderful with chili sauce on the side.  I used about half the recommended amount of fish sauce so it wouldn't be too salty.

Agree with the others.. very salty and I am a salt fiend. I added shredded carrot and green onions to it. Will make again, but really cut back on fish sauce

Great Recipe!  

We've been using a recipe very similiar to this in my family for years.  And we'll be using it for many more years to come.

Thank you for sharing!  

If you like, you can also top it with cilantro as a garnish.. and eat it with the Siracha sauce.
