I do not know anyone who eats them for breakfast, and I live in Denmark, Scandinavia.  In the old days we came, a small piece of apple in the middle of the cake. Now uses many prunes.  Just for fun, here is the letter "Æ" in Æbleskiver.  Æble = apple

This recipe was everything I was looking for -- straight forward and fool-proof. For years I had been "threatening" to make aebleskiver using my Norwegian great grandmother's pan that hangs on our beach cabin's kitchen wall. I didn't really know anything more about them than their name, and was always too intimidated by the project to actually follow through. Laura's recipe changed all that! These are easier to make than I'd imagined, and delicious. Making them twice in one week gave me the opportunity to try different fillings. I used applesauce in some, and whole freshly picked berries (Boysen, Tay, and blueberries) in others. My family liked them best unstuffed and then dipped in syrup, applesauce or whipped cream. Whipping the egg whites is imperative for success, and I used butter in the wells of the cast iron pan. Photos coming up soon. Thanks, Laura!

I don't own one of those special pans (even though I am of Scandinavian decent..how sad) and normally, that would discourage me...but no! I used the batter and made muffins! It totally works. I only made four servings but I baked them at 350 degrees for 13-15 min with the cups 2/3 full of batter. If I could do it again, I would bake them closer to 13...they came out a tiny bit dry but I had to kind of make it up as I went. Delicious. I prepared them with vanilla pastry filling inside, topped off with homemade whipped cream. A great, easy to make recipe you can do anything with.

I used to work for a Scandinavian shop where we served aebleskivers and recently went on a quest to find the pan and the perfect recipe.  I found the pan on the discount end racks at Target and then found this recipe.  I made the recipe as stated except added vanilla and had to make the buttermilk.  I served them to guests with an assortment of toppings to choose from including butter, maple syrup, lingonberries, whipped cream, and of course applesauce, lavender!  They loved it!

I had aebleskiver when I went to a scandanavian breakfast house and I was instantly in love. I wanted to make these at home and thus started my search for a pan and a recipe. I have tried this recipe a variety of ways: using "homemade buttermilk" and trying to whip egg whites in a plastic bowl (it doesn't work that great). What I really love to do is put bits of ground sausage and cheese, blueberries, or lil smokies in the pan after I've added the batter. I have tried many fillings, but these are my faves.  Also, the recipe says to flip over once, but these should really be a round ball. These will be hard to make in a new pan, but the more butter and oil you use, the more seasoned it gets, the easier it will be.

These were delicious. Really cute, lovely texture, with a homey pancake flavor. Loved mine with fruit jam or syrup.

I had my doubts because this recipe just seemed too simple, but these turned out great!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1% milk and it worked well.  I filled the cups full and they were much prettier than only filling 2/3 full. 

* * I used my Aebleskiver pan on my flat cooktop and it worked well. * *

Made these for breakfast today and they were great!  My first time eating aebleskiver, but they turned out very well.  I followed the recipe exactly except found you got the nicest, roundest aebleskiver if you fill the pan almost to the top.  Put a teeny tiny piece of butter into each hole between pancakes so they don't stick.  You can keep them warm in the oven until they all finish cooking.  This recipe made more than 5 people could eat, including 2 young guys who can eat a ton.

if you eat them without jam, jelly, or some type of syrup to sweeten them, they are bland & boring.  Maybe I will try to use the pan with a better pancake recipe. The dogs enjoyed them greatly.

When I was a young girl, my friends Mom would make aebleskivers for us for breakfast when I spent the night. They were the most wonderful things I ever tasted. It's worth buying the special pan for! One thing is, she added applesauce in the middle of them when filling the cups. You've never tasted anything so warm and cozy! We just dipped them in sugar. Love it!

This is almost exactly the same recipe my mother makes for our special breakfast every Christmas season!  Love it!  Glad to see other people enjoying Æbleskiver as well.

I've used a variety of Aebble Skivver recipes over the years...can't say that any of them was better than this...

...these are a family favorite...now a traditional send-off meal...

We make them for breakfast...which today was a little after noon...they are so good that you can/should eat them any time....

I have made this recipe a couple of times for my in-laws who are Danish.  They all LOVED it.  That's a huge compliment because they are all very particular about traditional Danish foods.  I followed the recipe as it.

I use the common milk and lemon substitute for buttermilk (1cup milk 2 tbp lemon juice) and bake them in muffin tins (15 min at 375) since I don't have the pan. This works great! Wonderful recipe.

Delicious! I was super nervous making these for the first time, but they were way easier than I thought they would be! Perfect recipe! I didn’t have any buttermilk, so I used 2 cups of milk with 1 tablespoon +1 teaspoon lemon juice and let it sit for two minutes before adding it. My kids ate 4 batches of these before I took them away! Ha ha!

This was a great recipe. Love the "soft peaks" instructions on the egg whites. These were great. The only thing that I did differently, is that I added 1/4 cup of water to the batter, because it was very foamy, and the batter wouldn't fill-out, as I rotated these in their little round divots in the pan.

Use butter in the divots, and cook them on med-low. I let the pan warm up while I was making the batter. Also, you need to make sure that your cast iron pan is good and seasoned beforehand.

Really happy to have found this recipe.

UPDATE: I made these again, and forgot about my adding 1/4 cup of water comment. These were FABULOUS!
Everything else was the same. And, I use Buttermilk Powder and sift it in with the dry ingredients, because I don't usually have real buttermilk on-hand.
We got a total of 32 Aebleskivers out of this recipe.
