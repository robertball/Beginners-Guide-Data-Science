Delicious Thai Taste. My family thought it tasted just like they ordered it from their favorite Thai Restaurant. I served the chicken with Peanutty Noodles.

I was in a hurry to cook dinner and picked this recipe based on everyone else's great reviews.  We all loved the chicken, although my husband and I enjoyed it more than the kids. Will definetly make again.  Have been wondering why the recipe calls out for *breast halves, chopped*.  Why chopped?  Also, the directions call it *coriander paste* - where is the coriander in the ingredients??6/7/04-I made this recipe again last night and pleased to see recipe was corrected based on my input.  This time I used boneless chicken breasts and they were fantasic.  Also, instead of fish sauce - I use soy sauce.  Thank you again for a *10* recipe.

Excellent chicken! I thought the cilantro would be overpowering, but it wasn't. The taste was delicious and even my picky pre-teen children loved it. I used boneless chicken breasts, grilled about 7 minutes per side and they turned out moist and tender. I'd serve this to even the pickiest eaters because the taste is so flavorful.

Excellent recipe but DEFINITELY wear gloves while handling the peppers and the completed marinade.  I didn't and ended up soaking my hands in cold/ice water for hours!

I mixed the marinade in a ziplock bag and then added fresh chicken then put in deep freezer to take camping.  It took a day or so to thaw in the cooler and was great on the grill however I did use a disposable tin tray to cook on, the marinade has a bright yellow color and would be a mess to clean off the grill or anything like clothing. I served it with a sesame ginger pasta salad and it was a nice change from meat and potato's.

Wow!  We've made this a couple times and LOVE it!  Next time I'm going to put it on skewers to make grilling easier.  (The smaller pieces are tastier, but they're hard to grill.)

Wasn't sure what part of the cilantro to use, so I just used mostly leaves, and probably not quite enough.  I was a little concerned about an overwhelming cilantro flavor, but that was NOT a problem.  We couldn't find "red hot chile peppers", so I used one "hot cherry pepper" (small, red, shaped like a habanero).  They aren't too hot, but have a great flavor.  Used 3 b/s chicken breasts, and grilled over high heat for a total of about 20 minutes;  we kind of burned it, but wow, it was still really, really good!  Just a tiny amount of heat.  My husband suggested roasting the peppers next time, which would really increase the intensity of the peppers.  Also, we used powdered coconut milk, which is REALLY convenient, and tasted just a good as freshly made or canned.

Mixed reviews in our house- I thought this was much to sweet and didn't have the balance of sweet and spicy I so enjoy with Thai food.  I recommend making it hotter or adding garlic or something.

I made this for a family barbecue and was worried that I was going to have too much left over since there was so much food including other meat dishes.  It was the only dish that was cleaned right out.  I used chicken thighs (skin on) and ignored all the fuss about cilantro roots etc. and just used two bunches of cilantro with the heavier stems and roots cut off and discarded.  I used an entire can of good quality coconut milk for basting only because I didn't want to waste any and it created a wonderful coating.  There are lots of flare-ups on the BBQ but all the flipping is worth the reward at the end.  I will make this often.

My whole family LOVED this recipe.  I read a bunch of the reviews before I made it and still felt I would follow your recipe as stated.  It turned out perfect.  I'm not sure why some people decide to try a recipe when they know full well they don't like a major ingredient ... ie. the comment from the reviewer who thinks cilantro tastes like soap.  The major ingredient in this recipe is "cilantro".  Why would you even try this recipe?  I suggest follow the recipe as given, it's AMAZING!

Exotic! Incredibly flavorful and surprising, I have never tried anything like it before! I marinated sliced breasts overnight, and it was great with jasmine rice. Next time I will try adding a little thai chili garlic sauce...I am passing this recipe on to all of my friends.

This is delicious! My boyfriend dislikes fish sauce, so I used this soy sauce based stuff called Dragon Sauce, which I found at the grocery store. I will definitely make this again soon!

Excellent! This was a delicious and unusual chicken dish that we all enjoyed thoroughly. And then I had to scrub the counters to get the turmeric stains off. That stuff is stainy.

This is a very lovely and exotic-flavored dish.  The presentation is gorgeous with it's cilantro green and tumeric yellow.  (Note: it did stain my fingernails yellow.)  While easy enough for everyday cooking, it has an air of festivity and decadence that makes it worthy of serving it to company.  I served it with Thai sesame noodles, a mandarin/almond salad, Jamacian-style ginger ale and coconut cream pie.  The compliments didn't stop coming!  

Also, for those with children... While I may not any yet, my fiance tried this and he esentially has the palatte of a 10-year old.  He really enjoyed this dish.

I recently made this for my boyfriend and I who LOVE Thai food and it was a hit. I substituted soy sauce for the fish sauce because I didn't have any on hand, and also used the entire can of coconut milk because I didn't feel like it had a strong enough flavor. I also don't have a grill so I just poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it in the oven. The result was seriously amazing though...it tasted just like the chicken satay at our favorite restaurant. The only regret I have is that I didn't reserve some of the sauce to use as a dip!

The sauce had a nice, interesting flavor-a nice change of pace. The fish sauce is definitely an acquired taste-strong! My children did not enjoy.

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  Easy to prepare, easy to make, quick to go.  I also used just chicken breasts and they were moist and delicious.  I added a couple of cloves of garlic not because I thought it was needed but becuase I thought it said to in the recipe.  It was delicious!

We made this recipe on a beautiful Seattle summer day with a whole cut up chicken and it came out great! Highly recommended! (tip: put the chicken in a ziplock bag, pour in the marinade, squeeze out the air and seal the bag, finally squeeze the chicken around in the bag to coat with the marinade)

This was delicious! I cooked the chicken according to the instructions, except I used three pounds of split chicken breasts, rather than a whole chicken. I also cooked the chicken on an indoor grill, rather than an outdoor grill. I served it with the "Stir-Fried Mushrooms with Baby Corn" recipe as a side dish, and yellow rice.

This is AWESOME!!  I doubled the recipe for the marinade just to make sure it was enough and I only marinaded it for 3 hours (it was all the time I had).  I have a picky family and friends from the UK that I was worried that might not care for it.  They RAVED aboout it!!  Doing it again tonight.  Janice B. Colorado

I really liked this dish, but my picky husband did not.  I thought the flavours were very unusual and wonderful, but if you don't like "thai" flavours, you might not like this one. It was very easy to prepare, and would be great if having company since you can make it a day ahead.
I substituted real Thai peppers (about 7 of them) and it still wasn't too spicy.

We have updated this recipe for clarity regarding the cilantro (coriander) paste. The type of chicken used has also been changed to more accurately reflect the original submission.

This tasted just like my husband's favorite entree at the Thai restaurant we frequent.  The flavors are outstanding.  Used the leftover chicken to add to a salad.  Delicious!

My husband & I enjoyed it very much.  Our store didn't have red hot chili peppers so I used serrano peppers and it worked out fine.  The only thing I will change (because I AM making this again) is to use more cilantro but this is just a personal preference. I also did the noodle salad and a green salad with an oriental citrus dressing and it was perfect with this chicken.  Thanks so very much for sharing this recipe.  :)

YUM!  we only marinaded for 1.5 hours and it was still delicious!  I'm sure it will be better the longer it sits.  We like it hot so may add more spice next time (we used one seeded serrano) and maybe a little lime/lemon juice too. Also, we used bone-in, skin-on breasts and grilled on indirect heat for about 45 minutes.
Super delicious on shrimp too!

My husband and I did not enjoy this.  We love VERY flavorful and exotic dishes but this didn't do it for us.  I felt as if the cilantro was too overpowering.  I LOVE cilantro and I cannot believe I actually thought so.  It needed less cilantro and more curry powder and tumeric.  Maybe I had an extra large bunch of cilantro (didn't seem so, however).  Lastly, since it was raining, I baked it as others suggested.  I won't be making it again.

Delicious any easy! The coconut milk burnt quickly, so had to turn the chicken more often, though it still blackened badly. However, the taste made up for it! Very yummy, a hit with the family - will definitely make again!

I served this chicken over basmati rice at a dinner party and recieved rave reviews from everyone there!  I followed the recipe as written except I used chicken tenderloins and baked the chicken at 350 degrees F instead of grilling.  The fish sauce is key!!

This was relly good. Next time I think I may up some of the seasonings to make it a bit stronger. I did marinate this overnight. It sure was a pain in the behind to grill (cleaning the grill) so I may try baking it next time.

And I essentially follow the directions, which is rare for me. The only thing I don't bother with is separating parts of the cilantro - I just throw it all into the food processor. I marinate this at least overnight, and it's great under the broiler if you don't have the time to fire up the grill. It works with both coconut milk and coconut cream, and just throw the rest in with some jasmine rice. Heats up great for leftovers as well!

The chicken was decent. I did it with chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. Finding Tumeric was like trying to find soy margarine, so I doubled up on the curry powder. After tasting it, the chicken was rather bland and didnt really taste like what I thought it would. Maybe if I find tumeric, I'll try it again, but instead of BBQing them, I'll use the oven.

This was good. I omitted the fish sauce as I didn't have any. I felt the chicken could have done with some kind of dipping sauce as it was a little dry on it's own.

I did NOT like this recipe, but for some reason I think cilantro tastes like soap, and this had a LOT of cilantro! As well, the sauce is bright yellow and hard to get off of countertops.

Incredible!!  I've never had chicken with so much flavor!  A very easy recipe too.  I don't even have a grill (just did mine on the George Foreman).  I used more than the 1/4 cup of coconut milk....I just kept basting every now and then...probably used 3/4 cup.  I cooked it about 15 min? on the George Foreman.  I only marinated the 3 hrs...plenty of flavor.  If you're afraid of too much heat, you might cut back on the red pepper....I loved it though.  Doesn't leave your mouth burning, but you can tell this is not your grandma's chicken!

The taste is simply exotic. The spices of Asia have it a very flavourful taste. I did add on some things.

This was great. Next time, I would make some changes, such as leave out the curry and the tumeric. You don't need it. I used those tubes of minced herbs for this meal, "Thai" flavours. Hot chilli, coriander, and garlic. I used two 12g tubes of coriander and only one of chilli. Dh says there's something missing, but he's not sure what. I don't think there's anything missing, as such, but that the curry and tumeric confused the flavours so on one hand you had the thai spicy/sweet, then on the other something like a satay, with curry (dh asked if it was tandoori by the colour and taste)and tumeric. It probably felt like something was missing because it had added spices of a different nature that didn't hone on the coriander/chilli/garlic mix. I used 2 tblspn of oyster sauce (my secret ingredient in gravies - thanks Dad!) and 1 tblspn of soy sauce.

Simply Delicious. Loved it so much and will definitely make again. Tasted very authentic! My little sister loved it and she is usually a fusspot. If giving it to children - maybe use less chilli. I had this on top of a Thai rice salad recipe (from this site) and they went together superbly.

This was fantastic. I had leftover ingredients which this worked perfectly for. I don't have a grill, so I cubed the chicken, skewered it, and placed the skewers over a 9x9 covering with tinfoil and baking at 425F and 5 minutes uncovered. I added a little bit of coconut milk to the bottom of the 9x9 so the chicken didn't dry out. Served over rice, it was great!
