The list of ingredients for this recipe is very good and produces a very nice tasting quick bread  that we all enjoyed.  However , I would not  recommend following  the directions  by beating all the ingredients together in a bowl for 5 minutes with an electric mixer.  Excessive  mixing will cause the overdevelopment of gluten and make the bread tough instead of tender..  INSTEADâ€¦  Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ones (Only when each bowl of ingredients is mixed thoroughly )  and fold them together gently until just combined. Do this part by hand rather than with a mixer. The end result will be a nice sweet, tender quick bread. THX

The flavor was nice, but it was on the dry side.  I used 1/2 t. vanilla extract and 1/2 t. lemon extract instead of 1 full t. of vanilla.  I sure hope that didn't affect the moistness of the bread.

This recipe can be used for muffins - bake about 23 minutes.  They turned out very moist and so easy.  I just threw everything together, except poppy seeds, in a medium bowl and blended.  I added 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, reduced oil to 3/4 cup, and added 3/4 cup apple sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!!

The baking time for this is too long - I baked mine for a little less than 50 minutes and it was slightly overdone. Next time I'll shorten it to 40 - 45 minutes. But, other than that, this bread is very delicious, with or without spreading butter on it.

This was just heaven! my family used to go to a certain restaraunt when visiting our grandparents, and the thing we always looked forward to was the poppyseed bread they gave as an appetizer. THis tastes exactly the same, delicious, and i even had to use a regular glass pan as we didn't have the correct pans, and it still turned out perfect same cook time and everything.  But what hit me the most is how simple it is to make it.

I don't have a mixer, but it came out fine when I stirred it by hand.

This was a great recipe. easy to make and very tasty! I kept one bread and gave the other to a friend. The bread was much better about 5 hours after it cooled than right out of the oven. I will definitely make this one again.

Pretty average - the poppy seed III recipe or poppy seed with glaze is better. This could have used some richness from using part butter for flavor and almond flavoring wouldn't have hurt. So just OK.

I add 1 cup of pecans. Great frozen, Slice while frozen into thin slices and make a sandwich with cream cheese with crushed pineapple. A favorite with my children. They love to make it for their teacers.

Pretty good...I made one loaf, six giant muffins and seven regular sized muffins.  I substituted a half cup of applesauce for the oil.  I used Vanilla Glaze (from this website) for the tops of the muffins and bread.  Yum!

This went together very quickly.  I did use half the oil called for and the other half unsweetened applesauce. Used the tsp of vanilla but also added a half tsp of almond extract.  Next time might go for a full tsp as I really didn't discern an almond flavor. Just stirred it all by hand to moisten, not much longer.  Made 24 muffins, baked for about 25 minutes.  Very moist with a tender crumb.

Absolutely wonderful!  Very moist, received lots of compliments about that, as well as the amount of poppy seeds used.

i made 1 loaf of bread and the rest muffins.  I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup veg oil as one reviewer recommended.  Also, I used 1 3/4 cup sugar and they were plenty sweet.   I used paper muffin cups and baked for 22 minutes.  The loaf only  took about 50 minutes to bake.  thanks for the recipe.

Very good and moist. Played around and made two different breads, one with almond extract and one with lemon extract. Will definitely make again.
