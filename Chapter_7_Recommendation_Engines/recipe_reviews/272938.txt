Pork Chops came out so moist and the seasoning was great.  My family enjoyed them and wanted me to make more.  I also made Chef John's Nectarine Salsa.  The pairing of these two was so amazing.

I had a pack of thin sliced, boneless pork chops I had to use so I looked for some recipe that was better then ending up with pan fried pieces of shoe leather and this did the trick. The chops remained moist and tender and the resulting pan sauce was amazing. I will be making this again but with the proper bone in thicker chops.

I had seen a recipe similar to this year's ago, but couldn't find it, so I was very happy to see this in Allrecipes. I love how pork chops come out using this method.  I love the flavor of the rub.  I have made it now 3 times, and experimented with other spices the second and third time.

This recipe turned out excellent, although I ended up brining it for 24 hours instead of 2. I was concerned it might be too salty, but the chops were flavourful, moist and tender. The cooking time was perfect as well. The brown sugar caramelized the chops making the plate presentation appealing. I added a bit of mango salsa to the top of the chops which balanced the sweetness of the rub. Great recipe!
