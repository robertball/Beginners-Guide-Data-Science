My Great grandmother (also from Ireland) used a very similar recipe; this is the only other time that I have seen it calling for the 'X' on the top.  However, we use melted butter/margarine (1 cube melted) instead of the sour cream and we scale the raisins down to approximately 3/4 to 1 cup; we dip the knife into the flour and then make our 'X'. We don't put seeds in ours. This was the first recipe that my cousins and I were taught to make when we were young girls, or 'wee ones' as our Grandmother called us. For some strange reason, the best bonnets (Great grandma said that they weren't loaves but "bonnets of bread") seemed to come from my mother's oven...an old Wedgewood. Now they come from my kitchen...I have an 'old Wedgewood' now.

This recipe is so delicious,  I have made it twice in the last three weeks.  Instead of 3 cups of raisins used 1 cup raisins, 1 cup dried cranberries and 1 cup chopped dried apricots.  The most recent time, I substituted Splenda for the sugar without any real change in taste.  I also divide it into 16 servings rather than 8.  At that rate it's about 175 calories a slice and not bad for a mid-morning snack.

This bread is PHENOMENAL! I was a little nervous at its consistency as during the preparation phase, it doesn't resemble a typical bread loaf.  It was more like very loose chocolate chip cookie dough, but that's ok -- that's the way it should be.  This was delicious beyond words and is now a part of my permanent recipe collection.

As the daughter of an Irish immigrant I've had plenty of Irish bread in my lifetime.  This recipe was easy and delicious.  Good enough that I even made a loaf and sent it to my grandmother since she can't really cook anymore.  I made a loaf last night too and have eaten 1/2 of it already.  I did use only 2 cups of raisins (1/2 golden & 1/2 regular) and 1 tsp of caraway seeds.  I don't care for caraway seeds but had to have some for authenticity.

I tried all the Irish soda bread recipes I could find. This was by far the best -- not just easy, but beautiful, amazingly moist and flavorful. I've made it over and over at the requests of family and friends. Toasts beautifully too, and wonderful with marmalade.

1/2008 UPDATE:  I'm still making this bread with constant raves from friends and family.  I made French Toast with it on Sunday morning and my husband and I LOVED it!  You need to let the slices sit in the batter a bit to soak it in.  YUMMY.


I made this with my corned beef and cabbage St Patty's Day meal. It tasted good.  I used only 1 cup of raisins and it was enough for me but my boyfriend thought 2 would have been better.  3 cups would be way too much!!  We both agreed the flour on top was yucky.  I blew the excess off but you really don't need it.  Next time I'll just brush the top with egg to give a rich color.  I'll make again b/c it's yummy toasted w/ butter.

i used this for my first and only soda bread baking experience and it has gotten rave reviews the four subsequent times i've made it!  it is absolutely beautiful and completely delectable.  my irish boss says, "as good as my mom's."  !*HIGH PRAISE*!  my baking afficionado friend says, "give me your recipe.  now."  !*I AM THE ENVY OF MY PEERS*!

DETAILS:  i just eye-balled the raisin quotient (probably in the neighborhood of two cups, no need to quibble over the specific amount).  i made it once without raisins and it was still spot-on, but not as popular. i substituted lowfat sour cream all four times and it remained uncompromised.  orange marmalade is a nice compliment but not at all necessary.

This is an excellent recipe....I made it a bit "low fat" by using light sour cream and making buttermilk from skim milk and vinegar.  I also reduced the amount of raisens to about 1 cup and it was perfect.  I didn't even "knead" it in the bowl, just transferred the batter directly to the baking dish for shaping and baking.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Excellent toasted in the morning!

Fast, easy, delicious. What more could you want? I made four loaves of this bread in less than an hour last St. Paddy's day, and have made it several times since. If you have any leftovers it makes great French toast or bread pudding. I did leave out the raisins because we don't care for them, and it was definitely sweet enough without them (you can pull back the sugar to 1/3 cup). I also made some loaves without the caraway. I love caraway but many people don't.

We needed soda bread for a corned beef and cabbage dinner at the local firehouse.  This was the best.  My 15 year-old daughter made 12 loaves of this, and each loaf came out wonderful!  Because a 15 year-old made this, it had half the raisins and no caraway seeds.  We fed over 100 people and everyone raved!

I used this recipe because it had such high ratings, but it came out much stickier than I had imagined and I've been baking bread for a number of years. It was so sticky, in fact, that I couldn't really slit the top as directed in the recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter and was disappointed. I used all purpose flour (rather than bread flour) because the recipe didn't specify any particular type of flour. Suggestions?

This recipe is simply delicious.  I was asked to bake Irish Soda Bread for a family St. Patrick's dinner, and chose this recipe based on reviews and the fact that sour cream was one of the ingredients.  When I started to mix it up, I realized that I didn't have any raisins, so I substituted dried cranberries.  I used about 1 1/2 cups, which I thought was plenty.  I also did not add the caraway seeds.  I mixed the wet ingredients with the dry, using a spatula, in my KitchenAid stand mixer bowl.  Then, using the mixer kneading hook, kneaded for only about 30 - 45 seconds.  It was a very sticky dough.  I just scraped it into my greased cast iron skillet and spread it out smooth.  Before baking, I brushed on a little milk and sprinkled with sugar.  It was done in exactly 65 minutes, and a beautiful golden brown.  It is very moist, not at all dry and crumbly.  Everyone loved it, and I was asked for the recipe.  I'm going to make it again as soon as I buy some raisins.

Fantastic bread! My kids LOVED it toasted for breakfast and I love how well this recipe lends itself to versatility.  I omitted the raisins and caraway (one of the kiddos doesn't like them) and added 1/2 tbsp each of cinnamon and vanilla extract.  I also substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream as I didn't have any.  Halved the recipe and baked in a metal 9x5 loaf pan for about 50 min.  The center was a little gummy so next time I might bake it a little longer.  I followed another reviewer's advice and let the dough sit for about 15 min to let the baking soda/powder "work" but then later read why that was a bad idea.  I think this may be why the center of my loaf was gummy.  I also threw some ice cubes onto the oven floor while it was baking for a nice, crispy crust.   I think I will try making a savory loaf next...bye-bye store bought bread!  
P.S.- Another great tip is to buy powdered buttermilk (very inexpensive), add it to the dry ingredients and then add the appropriate amount of water to the liquid.  You will always have buttermilk on hand!

I made this last week for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  Came up nice and high, rich and flavorful.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and vinegar, 1 cup milk to 1 tbls vinegar and I only had fat free sour cream.  It was stil fabulous.  making it again for ST Patty's day.  Thanks PL.

This Irish Soda Bread beat out our family recipe that was used for decades.  When I made this bread this past St. Patrick’s Day, everyone gravitated towards it and the loaf just disappeared.  The crust is firm and flavorful, but not tough.  This bread had a wonderful texture and taste.  Note while reading the instructions though.  The Cook Time at the beginning of the recipe states 50 minutes, then the instructions state to bake 65-75 minutes.  I baked mine in a 9-inch cake pan and the bread fully baked in 50 minutes.  There are many raisins in this loaf of bread.  You could cut back by a cup and I think there would be enough through out the loaf.  Enjoy this bread!

Is it authentically Irish? Who cares? It's authentically delicious and very easy to make. I used currents instead of raisins because that's what I had, and baked it in a buttered cake pan lined on the bottom with parchment paper. Will I wait until next St. Patrick's Day to make this again? Heck, I'm not sure I can wait until next week!

Fantastic!  First bread I've ever made and everyone that's tried it so far has really liked it.  With a little practice it may end up being one of my tried and true recipes! I changed the recipe a bit though for eight servings: used two cups of raisins instead of three (next time may use one-and-a-half cups and mix golden with dark raisins), used only one-third cup sugar and almost double the caraway seeds.  I couldn't believe how easy this was to make and as other reviewers have said it looks beautiful once it's done! The dough will also be too wet to cut a slit into at the beginning, so as another reviewer suggested I waited fifteen minutes until the top hardened and then had no trouble making the slit.  Can't wait to make it again!

I love baking breads of all kinds, and this is one of the best ever! I tried this bread yesterday (St. Pat's Day) to accompany my traditional boiled dinner - fare that we grew up on in Massachusetts.
Followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I used a couple extra T. of flour, since my eggs were X-large and made the batter too sticky.  Used those lovely, extra plump raisins that Trader Joe's carries. I can't imagine making this bread without ALL of the raisins -- and ALL of the caraway!  A delightful combination of flavors.  Next time, I will try a  springform pan, because the cooled bread didn't want to wriggle out of the cast-iron skillet. My husband is still raving about this bread after polishing off 4 big pieces for dinner and a bedtime snack.
UPDATE 03/17/11:  I brought an impressive-looking loaf of Irish Soda Bread to work this morning, and my co-workers loved it.  I've had many requests for the recipe.  I now make this bread in a 9-inch springform pan for about 60-65 minutes, and it's a cinch to get out of the pan (which I grease and flour first).

Great recipe, it was the 4th recipe I've tried for Irish Soda bread and it is by far the best. Though its traditional to use caraway seed I'm not a fan, so I left them out, and I only had 2 1/2 cups of rasins.  The stickyness of the batter was concerning but I shouldn't have been as it cooked up great. After pouring, or should I say scooping the batter into my 9" cake pan, I floured my hands and patted it down slightly prior to cutting the cross in the middle.   It was fantastic warm with butter and it held its own over the two days it lasted.  It toasted up perfectly on the grill and even took to a warming in the microwave (10 sec @ 30% power) very nicely.  This is a keeper!!!

Wow this is delicious! I just made it today for St. Patrick's day! It makes a lot, the dough about doubles in size so don't worry about doubling unless you're having a big party. It is very dense as well. I would recommend adding about 2 cups of raisins instead of 3. I used about 1 & 3/4 cups and it came out perfect. I was skimming over the pictures first, and some looked over powered by raisins! Well enjoy! I would also recommend the Irish potato candy recipe from this site, i made them as well!

I loved this bread.  But whats more important my husband was crazy about it.  I changed the rasins to 2 cups and boiled them in OJ until they plummed up good and I left out the caraway seeds.  I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon sugar.  I will make this bread again and often.

Delicious! I made this tonight for the first time, along with corned beef and cabbage, and I am in love! I had never before even tasted Irish soda bread, and have been missing out. I have no idea if this recipe is consider authentic, but it is fantastic by any means. Before I put it in the oven, I brushed it with a mix of 1/4 melted butter and 1/4 cup buttermilk. I then glazed it 4 or 5 times while it was baking. It gave the bread a beautiful golden crust. I also omitted the raisins and caraway seeds, as I was looking for more of a basic bread. I will definitely be making this again!

Wonderful Irish soda bread recipe. This is more like a cake than the super dense scone-like bread you might be used to. The caraway seeds while authentic are overwhelming to me and I will eliminate them next time. I also plumped the raisins before using. Put raisins in hot water for 5 minutes. I used only 2 cups, 1 cup golden and 1 cup regular raisins. Then strain and dry slightly before adding to the dry ingredients. I didn't have a skillet so I made it in a Calphalon 9" cake pan. It came out perfect. I made a second recipe and put it in 4 smaller baking dishes so I could give them to neighbors. (4 bake for 45 minutes) They baked nicely but the crust did not come out as beautifully in a ceramic dish as it did in the Calphalon.

This is the greatest recipe!! Nobody thought to write down my grandmother's recipe, but this is the closest I've made it to hers - I compared all the pictures. I made a few alterations (used one less egg), but I would def recommend it. Thank you for sharing...

Marvelous, totally delicious. I will make this over and over. The dough was very sticky, like a loose cookie dough, but the bread/cake is absolutely perfect. I made the recipe as stated and wouldn't change a thing.

REALLY good recipe.  Only change I made was using 2 cups of raisins instead of 3, but that's just a matter of personal preference.  I love caraway seeds, but Mom wished I used less.  Thanks for sharing, Ellen; I'll use this recipe often!

A-MAZ-ING. Super easy, usually have most ingredients on hand (gotta remember to keep buttermilk in the fridge) and really tasty. Can't beat it for toasted breakfast bread although it is good as a side to a hearty soup or stew also. Here is how you deal with the sticky factor: scrape into your generously greased baking pan, spray entire top with cooking oil spray, lay a piece of plastic wrap over it and mold as needed. Remove plastic wrap, sprinkle with flour and make cut using a wetted sharp knife. Pop it in the oven. Return in an hour+ for mouthwatering goodness.

Loved this! So easy to make and turned out great. Definitely brush the top with buttermilk, but do not dust with flour. I omitted the caraway seeds as a personal preference and used 2 cups of raisins instead of 3. This recipe is a keeper for me.

This was wonderful and so easy - I couldn't believe how huge the loaf was! I'm going to try it again with dates and apricots and leave out the caraway (I think its an acquired taste).

Best Irish Soda Bread I have EVER had.  Better than my family recipe, better than restaurant versions, and better than bakery versions.  I don't add caraway and I add less raisins.  Great for dinner with St. Paddy's day, but I make two loaves just so I can have a buttered slice every day with my cup of coffee in the morning.

The best irish soda bread recipe I've tried. I substituted 1/2 the flour as pastry whole wheat, used 2 cups of raisins, used margarine on crust when hot instead of dusting with flour, and no caraway seeds.  I believe 3 cups of raisins would be too much to serve it along with corned beef.
This is a fine crumb cake like bread versus recipes with cut-in fat that have a more biscuit type texture.  Recommend not adding more flour than recipe calls for.  It will be too sticky to knead but  just stir with spatula 10 to 12 times.
I split the bread into two round loafs so that the bread would cook throughly before becoming too brown.  I recommend cooking until a toothpick is clean or an internal temperature of 180 .

I decided to try this recipe as I wanted a change from my usual one.Was surprised at how many ingredients there were compared to the one I normally make.Have to admit I have never heard of putting raisins in soda bread,here in Ireland I've never seen it with raisins.It turned out ok,but I think I'll stick to my old faithful recipe of flour,bicarb soda,caster sugar,salt and buttermilk.

we loved this bread.  Just a slight hint of sweetness.  I did not have any buttermilk and just used regular 1%.  There were no complaints.

I have been making soda bread for 50 years.  This is by far the best recipe.  To make a delicious Christmas bread, omit the caraway seeds, substitute 1 cup of glazed cherries, 1 cup of walnuts or pecans for two of the cups of raisins.  Use 1 cup of currants/raisins.  We like this bread better than Christmas Stollen, which is a sweeter bread.  Be sure to allow all ingredients to be at room temperature before combining.  This is a winner.  

I have adjusted the baking time downward to accommodate my high oven.  Superb.

Look no further for a great Irish Soda Bread recipe!  This is the recipe I reach for each St Patty's season.  It makes a moist and delicious bread.  My family loves it toasted for breakfast.  I make 2 smaller loaves rather than 1 large.  Try it you won't be disappointed...... Promise.

moist--flavorful yet not overly sweet--was very well liked by guests----I did modify slightly to reduce fat and sugar --I used 1/2 cup of lofat sour cream (not 1 cup whole fat sour cream)  and only 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup sugar--added 1/2 cup apple sauce---was super!

Yummo!

Made two. Used only 2 cups raisins for each loaf. Had one 15 oz box and one little snack size, for the two. 

1st one - when I put it in the pan it was really sticky. When baked was eaten when cooled off somewhat. (Still warm). Very moist. Everyone liked.

2nd one - Add more flour to make it less sticky but not too firm, when kneading.  (Little bit of stick). This one was eaten the next day. I like this one better. Was very good. 

Outcome, delicious and very, very easy. Make sure you mix the dry well. I forgot to mix when I dumped the liquid. LOL. (Was measuring for two loaves).  Makes a nice big loaf.  Enjoy!!! And yes I sprinkled the flour on top. (No caraway's sorry don't like.)

Yum!  Only change I made was used self-rising flour, and put it into 2 loaf pans rather than a 9" round.  I used golden raisins as it's our preference, and I sure am glad I didn't cut back on them.

Dietary ingredient changes: I used part soy milk instead of cow. I soured 1/2 cup digestible milk with 1 Tbsp of vinegar as I can't get buttermilk in Italy. I added the soured milk and mixed with the flour somewhat. Then I added the cup of soy milk as I had read you can sour it, but some complained that it made for a (too) strong taste the next day.  Mine did not suffer from this.  I used half white-half whole wheat, but I liked the white flour version only better that I made before.  I only used 2.5 cups raisins, and it was chock full. I'm going to try a raisin-date mix and maybe some nuts too.  Everything is better with nuts.  This was excellent.

I wish I could give this 10 stars.  I've never made Irish Soda Bread before and I am glad I tried THIS recipe.  It was absolutely delicious.  I mixed it up in a snap and put in the oven.  Too easy!!  Everyone raved about it.  I used all the caraway seeds called for and certainly was not too strong.  Next time I might use a little more, gives it a nice flavour.  I also only used two cups of raisins.  If you want Irish Soda bread look no further  -  this is it!!!

Wow!!!!!  Delicious.  This was truly the best Irish soda bread recipe I have ever tried and will never use a different one EVER. I too was concerned with the consistancy but for no reason.  I did change it just a little to lower the fat and calories.  I used egg sustitute, low fat sour cream and made my own sour milk using skim milk and lemon juice and omitted the raisins(I don't like them in bread).  It did nothing to lower the integrity of this recipe. I will be making this again for Easter brunch.

Best Irish Soda Bread I have ever had.  This recipe was moist and had just a perfect hint of sweetness. It was picture perfect and delicious with my St. Patrick's Day meal.  Definitely a keeper, and will be on my table much more than once a year.

Made this bread to go with Guiness Irish Beef stew.  I split dough up so we had mini-breads and they came out great. I didn't make any changes and my wife + son agreed it didn't need any. Crust had a good crunch to it and inside soaked up the stew! I'll definitely use this one again...

I actually really like this.  It was not the soda bread that I was expecting.  It was denser, more moist, and sweeter than what I was looking for.  Still, it was very good.  We had it with beef stew and the sweetness of the raisins was lovely.  I only used 1.5 cups of raisins and that was fine for me.  Also I thought I had sour cream and it turned out that I didn't, so I added another 3/4 cup buttermilk and 4 TB butter in a pinch.  I will make again for sure.  Couldn't do the x on top as I like because it was not elastic enough, but it did have a sufficiently crusty exterior. I baked in a 9 inch cake pan.  It took 60 minutes in my oven.

This is the closes recipe to the orthenic Irish soda bread.
My mother came from Ireland and the only differecne to the this recipe is that the caraway seeds were increased to 3 to 4 tablespoons. The seeds is what gives the bread is taste and not a flavor of cake.
Good recipe

I made it tonight without any caraway or raisins- and only half the sugar.  I was plenty sweet, smelled like cornbread cooking, and turned out dense, very moist and crispy brown on the top.  So very delicious. (I also sprinkled kosher salt, garlic powder and poppy seeds on top prior to baking).  I think next time I'll make cinnamon raisin bread from this dough and technique.

The best Irish Soda Bread ever!   I tried baking it with 2 cups of raisins and that was delicious.  Also baked it with 3 cups of raisins and I have to say it was even more delicious! (Make sure you use baking raisins - extra moist for baking).   Used  only 1/2 TB caraway seeds - for authenticity.   I have fussy eaters and they loved it.

Just took this from the oven.  It is wonderful.  Not as dense as others I have tried - nice crunchy crust.  The only thing I changed was i only used 2 cups of raisins as suggested by others.  This was so very easy I  will be making it again & again.

Easiest, best tasting bread ever!  I make various types of bread, but this was my first attempt at Irish Soda Bread. I omitted the caraway seeds because they were not in stock in my grocery store.  Other than that, I followed this recipe to the letter, and I'm happy to report that it was an unqualified success! I plan to make several loaves of it for my neighborhood St Patrick's Day dinner this Saturday, and I expect that it will become a regular bread served in my home year-round.  Thanks for sharing, Penguin Lady!

This is the closest recipe to the real thing I have encountered anywhere on the internet.   My mother taught me how to make this type of bread when I could barely reach the table.   Only difference being that she used all buttermilk (which came from our own dairy and that sure made a difference) and her own home made butter.  What can I say - those days are gone.

Excellent!  Used exact ingredients but found I didn't need to bake is as long as noted.  Time could be cut by 5 - 10 minutes.  This makes a really large loaf so I made it a second time and divided between 2 pans.  PERFECT!!!

I used about a half teaspoon of the caraway seeds and a cup of dried currents I can't imagine the full amount of either). Plenty of both for my taste, without losing the authenticity of the bread. I'd give it 5 stars but I changed the recipe.

I also had never made nor had this before and decided to make it to go with the corned beef and cabbage.

I didn't have any sour cream so substituted non-fat yogurt.  My buttermilk was also non-fat (all I could find!)     So while the bread was non-fat, we just HAD to slather it with butter while it was warm and it tasted awesome!

We celebrated St. Pat's day a day early - and the left-over bread (it was only by great willpower that there was any left over) toasted up great for breakfast.  I can picture it as French toast too.

We all liked the abundance of raisins - but I can see how there were quite a few - might try currants next time.

Definitely a new favorite thing to make and eat!

I have never had Irish Soda Bread, let alone made it before today...but seeing as it's St. Patricks Day I gave it a try to go along with my Corned Beef & Cabbage (the Guinness recipe from this site).  I am very happy I did!  I too was concerned about the texture after mixing but I had read this was the case so I crossed my fingers after cutting the cross into the top and hoped for the best.  The Luck o' the Irish was with me because it is absolutely delicious.  I did cut the raisins back to 1 cup and baked it in a 10" cast iron skillet for 55 mins (did not have a smaller iron to cook in) but after 55 mins the top was nicely browned.  Now the house is filled with the aromas of the corned beef slow roasting.  Can't wait for us to try them both together for dinner tonight.  Thank you Penguin Lady for this recipe.  This will be a keeper in my Recipe Box.

I made this for the first time last year on St. Patty's day and forgot to save the recipe. I was SO RELIEVED that I was able to find it again! It was amazing and I was so worried I wouldn't be able to have the same delicious Irish soda bread this year. The other top rated Irish soda breads may be faster to make, but this is the most authentic and delicious tasting bread! I think I only did a cup and a half or 2 cups of rasisins, but I can't remember exactly. All I know is that I can't wait to make it again this year :)

Cut raisins to a scant 2 cups. Don't worry about kneading or cutting a slit - it's way to soft to do that. Turns out great anyway. Especially good toasted.

Needs fewer raisins and caraway seeds. I used 2c raisins and half the amount of seeds and it was much better.

Sweet enough, but not too sweet.  Moist and dense, not dry and brittle.  There may be a bit too much raisins - I just reduced the amount.  It was a very delicious soda bread.

I made this to take to work for St. Patrick's Day. It was excellent.  I used about half dried currants and half raisins instead of all raisins--but no other changes.  It was devoured almost immediately, and one coworker said, "I could eat a whole loaf of this by myself!"  I found it was perfectly baked at 60 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.  Also:  baked it in my cast iron skillet--perfect!

This recipe is great and has been well received by my family for many years.  I do cut the raisins to 1.5-2 cups.  Why I am writing now is I have an old recipe with very similar ingredients but has you soak the raisins in 2 tbsp of Irish whiskey.  I have done it for years and it plumps the raisins and adds a nice flavor, yet mild.  Just a thought!

Easy and very good. Had to use 1 cup plain yogurt for the sour cream with no ill effects. Used about 1 cup each...raisins, dried cranberries, and dried apricots. Enjoyed this! Thank you!

Very moist bread - tasty! I cut down on the raisins just a little to 2 1/4 cups, and it was plenty. For those who are not a fan of caraway seeds, at the full recipe amount of 1 Tbs the flavor was still very mild.

Absolutely wonderful.  Great flavor, easy to make, looks very impressive when you pull it out of the oven.  As stated in the recipe, the dough is EXTREMELY sticky, but the bread turned out well.  I'll be making this year-round.

This was excellent! I just want to warn that the dough, for me, was extremely wet....beyond sticky! So wet, the X I tried slashing didn't quite work. However, the bread was totally awesome.....moist, fragrant, a lovely compliment to our corned beef dinner!

This was FANTASTIC!!!  I served it for a presentation on Irish food and everyone loved it, plus my Irish professor kept complimenting me on how much better it was than any soda bread she had ever had!!  I did not use carraway seeds, used extra raisins, and used fat free sour cream.  The bread rose WONDERFULLY--it was huge.  This truly was delicious--almost like a cake.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

I am not a bread baker, & had never made soda bread, but this recipe was so easy!  I reduced the amount of caraway seeds & raisins to my taste, and I kind of just patted the dough down into the pan because it was too sticky to knead.  But it came out beautifully.  I can't wait to make some more to impress my friends!  Just don't forget to use a pan with high sides as shown in the picture, or the dough will seep over the sides.

I followed this recipe exactly - right to the exact measurement shown here -  and it didn't come out well at all. Way overdone on the outside, and didn't taste like Irish Soda Bread.  Practically needed a chainsaw to cut it. This is the only time I've ever had a bread recipe go so wrong.

I'm debating 4 or 5 stars. The caraway seeds gave it a nice twist but still not sure if it's in a good way. Must ponder some more. Ok I give up. It is good.

This recipe is the best...not heavy like some Irish Bread.  I added only 1-1/2 cups white raisins instead of 3 cups....really delicious!  The caraway seeds add lots of flavor.

I made this recipe last night.  I did not change a thing, and this bread turned out WONDERFUL!  This is the exact taste, and texture i like.  Its a bit more "cakey" then "bready", which is the way I love my irish soda bread.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  This is the first time I ever tried making it, I am so happy I found this recipe, I have to look no further.

Absolutely wonderful and easy.  Made it for the first time today with a friend and thrilled with the results.  Crusty and chewy and delicious.  We made 2 loaves and used a 15 oz. box of raisins between us which was just perfect.  Would not change a thing

I've made this twice now and the first time I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, and it was Amazing!!!!! The second time I only had one cup of raisins and about half a cup sour cream, it was still really good, but better the first time.

I have tried various recipes, some better than others. This was perfect for me. Add raisins using your own discretion. I did use a 10" pan.

This is a simple and authentic recipe. Definitely use cast iron or ceramic to bake. You can mix this dough using a stand mixer, combine dry ingredients first, combine wet separately, low for 2 mins to combine wet and dry into a ball, scrape sides, 30 secs on low, scrape and turn dough, 30 secs more on low. Bread took 55 mins at 350. Let cool 5 mins then remove to wire rack, covered.

I made this bread for my second-grader's St. Patrick's Day celebration. I opted for this recipe over a traditional family one, and what an improvement! This won over the picky eaters in the classroom and left everyone asking for more! Crazy easy and crazy good. Serve it with Kerrygold Irish Butter, and you can't go wrong!

So easy and delish! I did modify the fruit(1 c raisin, 1/2 c chopped apricots, 1/2 cup craisins). not sure if the caraway seeds are necessary, but i did add them.  Got rave reviews at my cooking club.  A keeper recipe!

My first time making this recipe was for a St. Patrick's day potluck this year. I made the full recipe and split the dough into two greased pie pans. Suffice to say, there were no leftovers after the Irish boys realized there was soda bread around and I'm keeping this one as an alternate to scones from here on out!

It was my first try at this bread. I found a couple of others before my friend pointed me to this recipe. Being that I am Hungarian and we put sour cream into everything, I went with this recipe. I was happy and my potential future in-laws were very pleased as well. 
It did scare me how sticky the dough was and I did have to reduce the heat a bit, as the dough started to brown fast- after about 20 minutes. By adjusting the heat I felt I had better control and both versions (raisins+caraway seeds; currant) came out to perfection. THANK YOU for sharing!

Wonderful! I followed the recipe with the exception that I used currants instead of raisins, and just 1.5 cups. Loved how it baked in the old cast iron dutch oven, and slid right out when cooled a bit. THIS IS A WONDERFUL SODA BREAD RECIPE! I will make this a couple of times a year, not just on St. Patrick's Day. ;o) Everyone loved it! ***I used all of the liquid and it turned out fine; (this is a very sticky dough F.Y.I.), turns out great. Pinch more salt next time.

Made this yesterday and was so disappointed.  I am not an expert baker and I followed the measurements carefully.  What I ended up with was a "dough" that was so wet and sticky there was absolutely NO WAY to knead it.  I went ahead and put it into my baking dish.  Tried to cut a cross and was only somewhat successful after using more flour.  It did bake and rise about like the photo that is currently displayed so I was at least happy about that.  But, then after cooling, I tasted it and found that it's just bland and dense - not at all what I expected after having eaten delicious Irish Soda bread in the past.  I came back here and this time I sorted the reviews by rating from low to high and found out that I'm not the only one who had these issues.  After reading another review, I realized what I did wrong.  You are NOT supposed to add all of the wet ingredients.  Apparently, you are only supposed to add enough of the wet mixture to make the flour mixture moist.  So, even though I thought I was being careful, I wasn't.  I used ALL the ingredients listed, but shouldn't have - who knew?  I do think the instructions should have been more explicit, but, perhaps if you are an experienced bread baker, this is something you WOULD know from the reference it did give.  Have raised my rating from 1 to 3 stars.  Still, if you do decide to make this recipe, I wish you the best of luck AND I strongly suggest you add a bit more salt to this because, even with caraway & raisins, it's bland.

This is a very good cake/sweet bread.  It is NOT good Irish soda bread.  It is sweet and cakey and without the tang of soda.

This was amazing. I made it as it was written minus the caraway seeds (I didn't have them). My family loved the bread. I will be making it again soon.

Made for the first time today.  Very simple.  Actually it seemed too simple.  I didn't have a 9 inch skillet or baking pan, so I punted and made them in my Pampered Chef stoneware muffin pan.  WOW!  They were amazing.

Highly recommend parchment paper!  Because of the amount of buttermilk needed, and not having another use for it, I made 3 loaves.  One in a loaf pan, one in a 9" cake pan, and one simply shaped.  A spring loaded pan lined with parchment would be AWESOME here as it would make it nice and easy to remove after baking.

Super simple recipe! I'd cut back on the raisins a bit, because some pieces felt like they had more raisins than bread. About one cup should be sufficient. I was worried, because the batter was really wet and didn't resemble the yeast bread doughs I'm used to, but it turned out just fine. Thank you!

I originally made this for a traditional Irish dinner that I was hosting & it was such a hit that I've made it every week since. It's super versatile - try it plain, use cranberries instead of raisins (I only use 1 c - not 3), non fat yogurt for sour cream (to save a few calories), Gluten Free - it's all amazing. I love that it's fast and no bread machine necessary to yields warm homemade bread in just about an hour. 
Noteworthy: My inlaws just got back from Ireland and said this is the most authentic soda bread in the states.

This was GREAT and added it to my fav recipes.  Being of Irish decent, I have been searching for a great Irish Soda Bread recipe only to find, until now, dense and dry breads.  The only change to the recipe that I made was that I used 1/2 golden and 1/2 black raisins because I like the mixture.

I've only had Irish Soda Bread one time and have NEVER attempted making before, but thought I'd try and make some for St. Patty's day tomorrow.  I'm glad I did!  It's great!  I was REALLY nervous when I got done mixing in the wet ingredients because the dough was SO sticky.  I was SURE I'd missed a cup of flour.  But I remembered that the  reviews I read, said that the dough resembled a wet chocolate chip cookie dough and that's EXACTLY what it was.  I also got nervous towards the end of the baking because the outside was getting SO brown I thought for sure it was going to be burnt to a crisp by the time 65 minutes went by, but it was golden brown when the timer went off.  I sampled a small slice with some brummel & brown yogurt spread and it's FABULOUS!  I didn't use the caraway seed since we'll be having kids over for dinner.  I also used reduced fat buttermilk and light sour cream and it tastes just fine.  I did use 2 1/2 cups of raisins instead of 3, but feel that even 1 1/2 cups would be fine.  Some of the bites are overpowered by raisins.  All-in-all it's a great recipe and I plan on keeping it for EVERY St. Patty's day!

Super easy and a taste sensation!  Love it!  Lightly sweet and MOIST.  I used golden raisins and greek yogurt and didn't dust with flour.  If you just slightly under bake this, it stays moister.  I recommend NOT kneading the dough because it's just too sticky.  Instead I used a silicon spatula and folded the ingredients into each other. ( FYI - the buttermilk QTY is just under a pint.)

Turned out pretty good.  Was a little worried since I've never made soda bread before, but I got rave reviews from my family and co-workers.  One said it was just like what his grandmother used to make!  Definitely will become a regular in this family's St. Patrick's day meal.

Cut the serving ingredients to 4 (half of the original recipe), I only used 1 cup of raisins. I also brushed the top with an egg wash before going in the oven and again during baking.  Minimal caraway seeds were used and I did not dust the top with flour.

Absolutely wonderful!!  I used Splenda, light sour cream and reduced fat buttermilk.  I made mine in my Kitchenaid mixer and didn't knead it, just used a low setting.  It was perfect.  This will now be the only Irish Soda bread recipe I use.

Super super super! This is so quick and easy to make and it produces such a beautiful loaf! I don't recommend you dust the top with flour, although doing that would produce a traditional looking loaf, trust me it'll be a floury tasting one. The hubby can't stand raisins so I used dried blueberries, added a tsp of orange zest and brushed the top with melted butter and honey. We've only eaten half of it and he is already requesting more!

This recipe was passed on to me by a good friend and it was the best!!! I was in a hurry to make it due to excitement, and didn't have buttermilk on hand. Substitution options included yogurt, that I had. I sub'd vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk and dried cherries for the raisins. Decrease the sugar though a tad if you sub the yogurt.

It was the first time this Italian lady made Irish soda bread. It was amazing.  Many of the reviews I read kept stating that the dough was impossible to work with.  My solution: I took a pair of disposable thin rubber gloves, washed them with soap and water. Rinsed thoroughly and the dough was so easy to work with.

Started making this recipe five years ago, as written. I then adjusted to my own taste by cutting the caraway in half (1/2 Tbsp). I use two cups of raisins instead of three (1 cup dark and 1 cup golden raisins, I like the contrast). I make five of these every St Patty's Day. One for me, one for work, one for a friend and two for a coffee shop that sells it!  The loaves I make for the coffee shop are baked in giant sized EZ Foil loaf pans 11.75 X 5.5 inches. This recipe fits the loaf pan perfectly. Thank you so much for sharing.

My first attempt at bread, I made by hand and it turned out well.  Several changes: 1. rather than 3cup raisins, and instead did 1 cup pecan pieces, 1 cup golden raisins, and 1 cup cranberries (made a for a great colour) 2. rather than 4 cups white flour i did 3 cups and 1 cup whole wheat (ran out of white but it turned out fine)

This bread was delicious! I had needed to make something for a St. Patty's Day potluck, and an attempt at cookies failed so I needed something quick and easy. This was perfect! Couldn't have been simpler, and the end result was tasty. It was best toasted with butter, but was still good on it's own. The only difference I made was to omit the raisins, since I kept hearing that real soda bread doesn't have them, and I also omitted the caraway seeds, since I read that a lot of people don't like them. I split the batter between two 7x3 inch pans since that's all I had. End result was delicious... it disappeared! >>>>> UPDATE: This was so good I had to make more, and kept it around as a snack bread. It was so tasty toasted with butter! I had promised the second loaf to my mom, and was so sad to let it go! lol

This is an awesome recipe. It is so quick and easy. I did subsitute low fat light vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and omitted the caraway seeds. The first time I made it, it was gone in one day. This time I doubled the recipe and sprinkeled cinnamon & sugar on top and WOW that was even better. In the morning toasted with some butter....YUM. About half way through the baking I put foil over the top so it would not brown to much.

This is the best bread of any kind that I've ever had.  I'm ditching my old Soda Bread recipe for this one.  I followed the recipe exactly but I reduced the baking time.  I think my oven just runs hot.

This was awesome!!  I made this for the first time to accent my St. Patty's dinner and it was a hit!!  Follow th4e recipe!!  Next time I make it I will add the full 4 cups of raisins... I only used 2-1/2 c. due to previous review comments and thought the raisins rocked this bread, so the full 4c. would not be too much for me.  The caraway seeds and raisin combo really works well... interesting and tasty.  The bread was even better the second day... moistened up from all those raisins.  Tip - don't try putting all that batter into an 8" round... overflow and stinky oven will result.  I'm definately going to be making this every year for St. Patrick's and will probably make it occassionally thoughout the year as a yummy comfort food!!

Very tasty, but I had a HUGE mess in the oven trying to fit this in a 9" cake pan.  The second time I made it, I cut the recipe in HALF and it worked perfectly in the 9" pan.  Took about 45 minutes to bake.  Good even without the raisins and caraway.  A bit too sweet when I had it with corned beef, but perfect for breakfast.  Next time I make it to go with supper, I will cut the sugar.

Made this recipe today for St Paddy's Day and my family loved it! Very easy-only a couple changes-instead of raisins (not a family favorite)I used a cup Craisins and I baked mine in a buttered 9" loaf pan. I'm sure I will be making this again!

Made two loaves of this yesterday and it is wonderful. I'd give it more than five stars if I could. I've made several types of soda bread over the years and read lots of recipes for it, but this version sounded simple and the reviews were great so I thought I'd give it a try. I made it exactly as stated, baking for about 65 min. The only thing I will probably change the next time is to add more caraway seeds and reduce the amount of raisins, but that's a personal perference. I'll serve one loaf with corned beef and cabbage to our guests tonight at dinner. The other loaf we sliced and toasted. My family devoured half of it at breakfast!

Made this very easy bread today and it is delicious.  Substituted Splenda for sugar, used low fat sour cream, and baked in 2 - 8" x 4" loaf pans for 55 minutes.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly.  May try without the caraway next time, just for comparison.  Hubby loves it.  Taking a loaf to our son and daughter-in-law for dinner tomorrow.  Definitely a keeper!

Tried over the weekend and it came out great. As other suggested, I also cut down on the sugar to 1/3 C and raisins to 1 C. In addition, I did an egg wash after 30 minutes to give it a shine plus I pre-heated the cast iron skillet which seems to provide a uniform temp on the bottom and the heated skillet seems to release the bread easily

I tried this for St. Patrick's day, and everyone loved it! The whole loaf was gone in less than 6 hours.  The finished product looks like it came from a gourmet bread shop rather than homemade.Instead of raisins, I added dried cranberries.  This has become a favorite recipe.

EXCELLENT! Made it this afternoon for my St. Patty's day feast tonight.  Took a slice for myself as soon as it came out of the oven.  Left out the caraway (not sure my picky eater would like it) but left everything else as written and baked it for 65 minutes. The outside browned perfectly and the inside is dense, moist and chock full o' raisins.  A definite keeper!

I've made this receipe a number of times and love it.  It is quick to make and the bread is delicious.  It keeps well for a number of days.  Additionally, I have frozen part of the loaf and it always defrosts well.  

3 cups of raisins is quite a lot.  I typically use 2 cups instead of three (often to save money as raisins are expensive).  The amount of raisins really depends on personal taste, but I generally prefer no less than 2 cups.  

To make a healthier bread I sometimes subsitute in 2 or 2.5 cups of wheat floor for the same amount of white.  This brown bread version has a slightly different taste, but is equally delicious.  Depending on how much wheat floor you substitute you may want to add a little extra buttermilk as the wheat floor soaks up more of the wet ingredients than the white.

THIS RECIPE WAS TERRIBLE!  I will never make this again.  The dough was way too wet, and when baking, spilled over the sides of my pan and created the biggest mess in my oven.  I do not recommend this to anyone!

I do not bake much, so my prep time was longer than advertised but that is fine.  I may have forgotten the salt, I cooked it at 375 for the first 30 minutes because I misread the instructions, and even with my inexperience and those blunders in the mix it turned out great.

The dough is very sticky, I haven't figured out a way to do the kneading without getting it all over my hands (and then struggling to get it off). I highly recommend using wax paper to press it into the baking dish (that may be obvious, see "I do not bake much").

I loved this bread.  We are not raisin fans so I used 1 cup of dried currants.  That provided A LOT of fruit and I am glad I did not add anymore.  My husband said more is better so I guess it is just personal preference.  I also used just 1/2 TBSP of caraway seed.  That provided a subtle flavor so I am glad I did not add more.  My only complaint is the amount of flour added to the top before baking.  Next time I will try using less flour and sifting a very fine coat over the top.  Using a whole TBSP gave clumps of flour to some of the slices.  This bread rises quite well and since we have plenty left over I will probably use another reviewer's suggestion and make french toast with it.  I am sure it will taste great!

Excellent recipe!  Loved the bread.  Brought it to friends and they said it was the best they had ever tasted.  I agree.  Very easy to put together no mixer needed.  Dough was very sticky, but kneading it in the bowl was easy. The finished loaf was beautiful.  Needed almost the full 75 minutes to bake.  I didn't have enough raisins so put half raisins and half currents.  Loved the result. Perfect!

Perfect recipe!  I just made this yesterday morning.  The bread's crust softens a lot after a few hours.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to let bread cool about 30 minutes, then lightly wrap the warm bread in foil to trap some moisture.  This will be on my table every St. Patrick's Day to go with Guinnes stew.

Scrumptious! And oh so easy! I was nervous about the sticky dough, but I got rave reviews from my children and the teachers I shared with. When I mixed the dry ingredients, I made sure that the raisins all got individually separated (they tend to clump in the package). When I added the wet ingredients, I used a wooden spoon to gently stir everything just until well blended - no further kneading.

Loved this recipe.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used 2 cups of raisens instead of 3 and 1 tea. of caraway seeds instead of 1 tbsp., and it was perfect.   Really delicious!  My friends liked it so much that they asked if they could take some home for their husbands to try.   This was also an easy receipe to follow and make.   Will definitely make again.

Great easy and very versatile. I  used 1 cup raisins, 1 cup of :dried cranberries and a handful of slivered almonds. I never use caraway seeds, as I don't like the taste. Never lasts as everyone on the family loves it

I made three loaves of this bread, but the third loaf I added chopped apricots & some orange peel it gave a nice flavor.  I gave a loaf to my friend and she thought it was amazing.  This will have to go on my Facebook page.

This recipe is "Tried and True"  I used a scant 2 cups of "plumped in hot water" raisins.  I used 1 teaspoon of caraway.  Next time I will use either 1 1/2 teaspoons or 2 teaspoons caraway.  This batter was not like cookie dough but more like a thick cake batter.  I made it in my cast iron skillet but next time may use a spring-form pan.  It was delicious and got rave reviews!  Consider sprinkling the top with confectioners next time.

I tried this the other day because it was St. Patricks Day, and it turned out amazing! I was worried when I was making it because it was super sticky. But in the end it turned out amazing! I didn't add the caraway seeds and added dried cherries instead of raisins and my family loves it.

Really delicious.  Didn't have caraway seed so we didn't experience that flavor.  We love raisins and can't understand how anyone could think that there were too many raisins!  This replaces my old Irish Soda Bread recipe.  Thanks!

This is my go to for soda bread, it is flavorful, great crust and it is dead ringer for my grandmothers bread which we could never seem to re-create because she just mixed everything from experience and feel. Every year people start asking if I am going to make some.  They even plan to "cheat" on their diets for some.

This bread is so good! It was so easy to make and turned out to be one of the best breads I have made. My family all loved it. I will be making it again. It is a keeper!  I will say I added golden raisins and because I didn't have enough I also used Craisins.  I baked in a 9" round pan. Delicious:)

This was the absolute best soda bread that I've ever had. Makes a nice high loaf that is moist and sweet. Everyone loved it. This will be my new soda bread recipe from now on. I don't think it could get any better than this. Thanks Penguin Lady. You're a genius.

I've never been a big fan of Irish Soda Bread, but this recipe changed my mind! It was so moist, with an excellent texture.  I omitted the caraway and used a combo of raisins, dried cranberries, and dried apricots totaling 3 cups.

great-I veganized it by substituting equivalent wet volume of rice milk with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar for the egg and dairy products.  loved the caraway seeds, nice touch.

I have tried so many Irish Soda Bread recipes.  They all tasted good, but were dry and crumbly.  This one is the absolute best! Great taste and texture with just enough moisture.  I made it, as written, except eliminated the caraway seeds.  I will keep this one.

Great recipe I used a cup of golden raisins and a cup of dried cherries, the dough was quite sticky so I just stirred  in more flour a 1/4 cup at a time until it was manageable while turning in the bowl. Also brushed on the 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup buttermilk  a couple of times while baking from another recipe. I had to adjust the temp down to 325 because it was getting too done too fast but that could have been my oven. I just hope it will come out this good every time because I think it was perfect.

I have baked this twice now, once in a round pan and it was just ok. The last two times though I have baked it in a cast iron pan and I used butter flavor crisco to prepare my pan.  It baked up very nicely both times in the cast iron and had a better smell and flavor than in the aluminum cake pan.  I also found that although I could use two percent low fat milk, it was less sticky when I tried to knead it if I used evaporatedmilk ( do not use condensed milk).  It basically baked better in a cast iron no matter what milk I used.I rate it five stars

This was surprisingly easy to make. I think I either measured wrong on the flour or there's just too much but I had a ton of flour I was brushing off when the bread was done in the oven.

I was surprised to know there's sour cream in the recipe! haha

I'm not too big of a fan of irish soda bread, but I had to make it, you can't NOT have it. Everyone else absolutely loved it and it did taste right haha so that's a good thing!

Will make this again next year

This was such an easy bread! I could easily see adding different ingredients to vary the flavors a little. Minced onion, sharp cheddar, chives, lots of possibilities.

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE, BUT YOU NEED TO CUT THE AMOUNT OF RAISINS, OR IT COMES OUT LIKE RAISIN BREAD AND IS TOO SWEET.   I USED 2 CUPS, BUT WILL USE 1 1/2 CUPS NEXT TIME.  I ALSO CUT BACK SOME ON THE CARAWAY.  OTHERWISE IT IS MOIST AND BEAUTIFUL.  TRY IT !

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used ground caraway (all I had) in the same proportion. My only complaint was that the raisins were overwhelming. 3 cups is just entirely too much but I'm not sure what will happen to the recipe if I cut it down by half. Otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, especially the sweet, aromatic crust. mmmmm...

Loved it.  Made it just the way the recipe is listed.  Loved all the raisins and the taste of caraway seeds.  I did find that it was done at 60 minutes, probably because my oven runs a little hot?  So do start checking at 60 minutes.   I used a cake pan this time; might use a round casserole pan next time.

My 1st time making Soda bread, and this turned out fantastic. I only used 1 cup of raisins which I had plumped, omitted the caraway seeds, thought that we had some....didn't. Baked for 70 minutes, which was just right for my oven. Earlier I prepped the cast iron skillet and put it out of the way. I realized the error while I was kneading. Had to call my wife in to get the skillet for me she couldn't beleave that gooie mess was going to turn out into bread, and if I hadn't read the ratings here I too would have been adding more flour to make it "look right". Thanks for sharing, will be making this again and before St Pat Day.

I've never had this kind of bread before so I don't know how authentic it is, but I'm a believer that as long as it tastes good it doesn't matter.  I had to modify two things...I didn't have caraway seeds, and my hubby doesn't like raisins, so I left them both out.  I don't know if I would buy caraway just for this recipe, but next time I make it I'll add the raisins.  I can tell it would taste wonderful with them in it.

I forgot the eggs and used water instead of buttermilk! It tasted the same and had the same texture. It calls for 3 cups of raisins. Use 1 and a half cups. 3 is too many.

Very dense bread. I'm not sure if you're not supposed to add all the wet ingredients because my dough was very wet (like a batter), and not sticky. I could not make the cross on the top because of this. I only used 1 cup of raisins, and did not use caraway seeds (because I did not have them). I did like cooking it in my 9 inch cast-iron skillet. I have a recipe from my grandmother that I will stick to over this one.

This was a big hit! Moist with a crunchy dense bottom. The first time I made it I used 3/4 cup of additional buttermilk instead of sour cream. I think it came out denser which I liked, though there was no way to cut an x in the batter. I wish there was a way to get a lighter color and texture on top. Any hints?

This was my first time making Irish Soda Bread.  I made it for a St. Patrick's Day potluck at work.  Evidently, people in SC have never heard of it.  I love it with whipped butter.  I can't stand caraway seeds - I took them out, but didn't feel I could give 5 stars since I changed the recipe.  But with that slight change, I thought this was perfect!  Just as I remembered from my childhood.

The last time I attempted Irish Soda Bread it came out like a gigantic biscuit, so my husband was scared that I was trying it again.  We were both pleasantly surprised at how delicious this recipe was.  I didn't have a 9 inch baking dish, so just put it in a 9x13 pan after shaping it into a ball.  I was afraid it would spread too much, but it was actually perfect.  Love, love, love this....can't wait to try it again.  Incidentally, I thought I had caraway seeds, so didn't buy any at the store, but it turns out I didn't have any.  Next time I will definitely try the caraway seeds.  I also only used 2 cups of raisins.

This is very good & easy!!  I made this last night for St. Patrick's Day.  I threw it all together in literally 10 mins before heading out the door for my daughters softball practice.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used the vinegar/milk solution & used about 1 cup of raisins & 1 cup (or whatever I had left in the bag) of craisins.  LOVED BY ALL!

Very moist and tasty and it makes a large loaf.  I only had two cups of raisins so I added 1 cup of craisins to the raisins.  My husband and family raved about how good it was, not dry at all...

this bread is phenominal! i made it for work with the Irish Beef Stew recipe & my co-workers really enjoyed the combo.  personally, i'll leave out the caraway seeds next time as they have a black licorice taste.  otherwise it was a wonderful bread.  don't be worried abt the consistency of the dough - it's very gloopy like a wet cookie dough but bakes beautifully.

Made the bread this afternoon, 2 loaves, and it is AMAZING!!  I baked it for 55 minutes and it's perfect in the middle, as I know oven temps run different so the timing worked for me!  This deserves 10 stars!!  I just took the 2nd loaf over to a friends house, she just sent me a text and said: "send me the recipe ASAP!  So I did!!

I think I overcooked mine. I think that the 65 minutes may be too long, as my loaf came out a little dry. I would add 1/2 the raisins and skip the caraway seeds.

I had never made Irish soda bread before.  This was a really good recipe for it.  It is a smidge dry, but I think that is partly the nature of soda bread.  Really fun St. Patty's Day treat covered in some butter along with a good Irish dish!

Absolutely delicious. I really enjoyed this soda bread. Easily the nicest I've ever had. Lasted well for a few days too.  Recommended.   Only change I made was to add slightly more flour as I was making the dough, as was very sticky. I also wouldn't put the flour on top next time - don't think it was necessary.

This recipe is really easy to make and tastes great! Just make sure to cook it long enough to where the top and sides are a very golden brown! I've made it three times and had great results every time! However, I would recommend eating this bread right away, after a day or two it starts to change and takes on a different(and awful) taste and color!

Having never eaten or made Irish soda bread before, I was nervous baking this!  I used whole wheat flour instead of regular and cut the raisins down but a cup, but I got rave reviews at my St. Patrick's Day luncheon!  I thought it was best with some butter or margarine spread on top.  Yum!  Great recipe!

Our first try with Irish Soda Bread and we are converts!! I did not have regular buttermilk so used 5 Tbls of powdered buttermilk with 1 1/4 cups water.  That was the only change. This is so easy and so delicious.  Will be using leftovers for french toast this weekend.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I never liked Irish Soda Bread because of the caraway seeds, but after making this at home (and omitting the seeds due to preference) I'm so in love with this bread. Thank you for this simple, tasty recipe.  A keeper for sure.

I used 3/4 tsp. anise extract instead of caraway seeds and 2 cups raisins and 1 cup craisins, but 2 cups of fruit total would have been plenty. I only baked it for 60 minutes, and it was perfectly done. Very good taste and nice texture; tasted even better the next day. Good recipe!

This was really excellent. It is best on the first day only however.   I made as described except I omitted the raisins and caraway. I will probably add the raisins next time. As noted by other reviewers the very idea of kneading this is absurd. It is a sticky, gooey mess once mixed. I just plopped it into the prepared cake pan and hoped for the best. In the last 15 minutes I set a piece of tinfoil over the top to keep from browning too much. Otherwise super easy and great. I might cook it five fewer minutes next time. Thanks.

I thought it was pretty good, hubby loved it!  Looks impressive.  Didn't have a full 3 cups of raisins; used a mix of raisins and dried figs, apricots, cranberries, etc to equal ~2 cups and it seemed to be enough fruit.  Didn't have caraway seeds, but I put in some fennel seeds (or anise?) and it tasted good.

I have been eating soda bread since a little girl. This is by far, the best one I've had!  I like it a little sweet and this hit the spot. I have made the original recipe and have also done it with some changes....all were fantastic. If you aren't razy about raisins, try dried cranberry..I have also added a 4 Tbs. of butter to the dough after combining the wet/dry ingredients....this disappears in my house very fast!!

Very easy to make, the dough is quite wet, it should be. Makes a great loaf, wonderful crust and texture! It's also quite good toasted. Thanks for the great recipe, I will be making this again.

Delicious!  I left out the caraway seeds and used 2 cups of dried sweetened cranberries instead of raisins.  The dough is VERY gooey and sticky so I couldn't exactly knead it or cut the slit on top.  It seems almost like really thick waffle batter.  But it turned out fine - very moist inside with crunchy edges - just the way I like it!

P.S.  Half the recipe is a pretty good size loaf already but there's no such thing as too much bread.

I've made this several times, very easy & delicious.  Definitely use a cast iron skillet.  My Irish husband says it tastes like his mom's, she was born & raised in Ireland.  The dough gets a little difficult(very sticky)to deal with near the end but just place it in the skillet & you're done.

I didn't like this one.  It was too moist and raisin-y.  Only change was I put in 2 cups of raisins and it was too much.  My co-workers called it a moist raisin cake.  The 1T Caraway seeds were lost.  It looked great BTW, I cooked it in a cast iron skillet and it was HUGE and lovely to look at but I will keep searching.

Excellent flavor and beautiful appearance.  I did have a couple problems with the dough, however.  First, it was more like very thick batter when I was through mixing - definitely not kneadable, and I could see that I wasn't going to be able to score it with a knife.  So I added a couple more handfuls of flour, which helped a little... but still I couldn't knead or score.  I didn't want to add any more flour for fear of making it too heavy, so I just scraped it into a pan.  I used a greased springform cheesecake pan, which has higher sides to accommodate all that batter.  It baked up wonderfully, a beautiful brown loaf that smelled heavenly!  The raisins were perfectly distributed, although I would have used 2 cups instead of 3.  After it cooled, I cut it in half to freeze one half, and found that the middle was slightly gooey.  I was disappointed in this.  But I will try again and see if I can fix it, because the flavor was out of this world.  Next time I will use two regular 9-inch round cake pans and see if that helps them cook through.  I will reduce the baking time to around 45 minutes if I do this.

Awesome Irish Bread! Made it for St. Patrick's Day in a big cast iron skillet...I felt authentic! My only hang-up was that the cooktime in the summary says 50 minutes and the cooktime in the recipe says 65-75 minutes. I had never made soda bread before so went on color and it seemed done at about 60 minutes...I'd go with 65 next time. Other than that it was great!

The only soda bread recipe I have ever used that did not produce a doorstop - it was fabulous!  I had to remind everyone that dessert was waiting, or we would have polished it off in one sitting at dinner last night.  My only change: 1.5 c of raisins instead of 3, but will use more next time - this recipe can handle it.

Hot out the oven with some butter on top and I was in heaven...I am ashamed to admit that I scoffed down four pieces at once.  I skipped the caraway seeds for taste preference and you def only need like 1 1/2 to 2 cups of raisins which I did half regular and half golden.
This is a moist irish bread not dry. My dough wasn't too sticky but it was wet-thought I did something wrong but it cooked up beautiful in 60minutes.  I took another suggestion from a review and suppl the sour cream with a stick of melted butter and found that loaf to be drier.

I have made this soda bread for a couple of years now.  We always do a huge corned beef & cabbage dinner complete w/Irish coffees w/my husband's very Irish family.  Let's just say that I'm not allowed through the door to eat unless I prove the bread is with me.  Yes!  It's THAT good!

FANTASTIC!!!  The only thing I changed was the raisin amount.  I used one cup of raisins and one cup of craisins (dried cranberries) and everyone went crazy over it!

This bread is very good!  I gave it four stars instead of five because I only use one cup of raisins.  Three seems to be a bit much to me.  This is a dense, soft bread.  The dough is definitely very sticky, and I wasn't able to cut a slit in the top.  What I did was allow the bread to bake for about 10-15 minutes until it was slightly hardened on top, then cut the slit.  That worked well and the bread baked nicely all the way through.  I baked it in a stoneware loaf pan.

This bread is super.  I followed the recipe exactly and the results were wonderful.  I used a fluted removable bottom flan pan to bake the bread.  The dough was sticky but had no problem sneading it in the bowl.  I also used powdered caraway seed instead of the regular seed.  Seeds are a problem for our family.  I used 1 huge rounded tablespoon of the powdered seed.  Next time I am going to add some cranraisins to the raisins.  Wonderful recipe...Recommend it highly.....

Didn't use the raisins, my family won't eat them in baked goods.  But this was a huge hit, wonderful flavor and very moist.  Will make this more than just on St. Pat's!

Wonderful recipe!!!! The best tasting.  I used baking raisins ( they are moist) and decreased the amount (many people don't like raisins).  I baked in a stone loaf pan and took it out after 60 minutes.  FANTASTIC.  This will be my annual recipe on st pats day.  Thanks

I omitted the caraway seeds and mixed all ingredients in a bowl. I lined a 9 inch round pan with parchment on bottom and around the side. Instead of flour on top I brushed with egg. Still the best soda bread I’ve ever made. I make this recipe every year!!!

It was delicious.  It was also the consistency of porridge.  Needed extra flour and still took over an hour and a half to cook.  I don't know how this isn't a problem for everyone else.  I made no changes to the recipe except to add less raisins.

I've never made Irish Soda Bread before but this recipe is a keeper!  It's perfect and I didn't change a thing. Wasn't sure if it would turn out or not because it was so sticky but it's delicious.  No need to look further for the perfect recipe.

Every year I try a different recipe for Irish Soda Bread on St. Pat's Day.  This one is the best ever, and it will be the one I use from now on.  EVERYONE loved it! It is so moist and flavorful, I ate it without spreading butter on it.  I only used 2 cups of raisins as suggested by other reviewers and soaked them in hot water for about 5 minutes.  I mixed all the dry ingredients with my stand mixer. I mixed the wet ingredients in a separate bowl with a wire whisk.  Then I added the wet ingredients to the dry and mixed for about a minute with the stand mixer.  I didn't bother to cut the slit or dust with flour.  Absolutely wonderful!

I've been making bread for a long time but I've never made a soda bread. I tried this recipe and the bread turned out very well.  The bread had a slight sweetness to it--just right for me.  I used only two cups of raisins-- which was more than enough for me--and baked it in a cast iron skillet. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Wonderful recipe!  Discovered (after I had begun) only had 1/4 cup raisins,so added craisins, chopped apricots, and finally gogi berries in order to come up with 3 cups total.  It STILL came out very good and tasty!  I have ordered raisins (black and golden) in bulk, so won't run out again soon!  I will be making this recipe agin and again! I keep believing that I will read ALL the recipe directions, before starting, but I keep fooling myself!

I omitted the raisins and caraway, my goal was for this bread to accompany corned beef and cabbage. But followed the rest of recipe to the letter. It came out superb! There were many happy faces munching my bread at our feast and there was even an arm wrestling mach for the last slice, what a compliment!

I made this to go with our corned beef dinner and we ate it hot out of the oven. My dough was so soft and sticky I couldn't mark the 'X'on top and it rose up like a giant popover.  Crunchy golden crust.  Tender, yellow and slightly sweet inside.  Only had 1 cup of raisins and it was enough. I wouldn't recommend omitting them.

This earned for me many compliments from my co-workers , including one who said she does not normally like Irish soda bread!  It has a nice blend of flavors and just the right moistness.

I have nothing to compare this to as it's my first time having Irish Soda bread. That being said we loved it. I used all the raisins this time though I think as previous reviewers have mentioned 2 c would be plenty. I'm not normally a fan of caraway but together with the raisins it worked well in this. I feel like more reviewers should have noted that this dough is not the same consistency as one would normally think of bread. A few touched on it's "stickiness" but it's much more than that. I would say it is closer to the consistency of muffin or loaf bread mix. Finally, I baked it in a buttered deep dish pie pan for 65 minutes. It rose nicely and had a great crust. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this bread for our dinner on Sunday with Corned beef and cabbage. It was somewhat dry but very tasty warmed with butter spread onto it. My daughter took some thick slices home with her to use for French toast. It sounded so good I actually made some for breakfast this morning. Very Good! I definitely will make it again!

I've made a few Irish Soda bread recipes off the site. I tried this one today because it was made in a cast iron skillet. After measuring all of my pans I found the correct size and made a loaf. This bread is DELICIOUS! I used about 2 cups of golden raisins and opted to not use the caraway seeds. It came out crusty and delicious. After cooling it I put it into a plastic bag and it stayed softer and very moist and still yummy. Tonight I will feed it to my critics...my kids and grands. I'm sure they will agree with me. Try this, you won't be disappointed.

OMG! This is so easy and SO good!!  I followed the recipe exactly with two exceptions:  I didn't have any sour cream, so I used fat free Greek yogurt, and I used 3 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup white whole wheat flour.  I mixed it all in my stand mixer and baked it in my 10" cast iron skillet. It was done in 65 minutes.  It turned out beautifully and was absolutely delicious. We loved it and it will remail in my "keeper" recipe file!!!!

This is the best soda bread recipe for an American kitchen. Most buttermilk is skimmed - no fat. To replace the fat, sour cream is the trick. Let the bread rest for a day under a dish towel. To the reviewer, who wrote she had never heard of a cross cut in the top, there is always a cross (vent) on the top so that the fairies can escape. If you don't know what they are, you're not Irish

It was very good. I did cover the top with foil for the last 10 mins or so. Used the bread for maple turkey sandwiches two days later and was still yummy.

Made (and ate) this for the first time yesterday (St. Patty's). Though I ran short of (white) raisins -used ~2.25 cups- and pulled it out 5 minutes early (I was afraid it would be hard as a scone) it came out delicious, and with just enough softness. Even though it's just for me and the husband, I'm having to ration it out, otherwise he'd eat it all at once!

I made it for St. Patrick's Day, to go with our corned beef and cabbage. It turned out perfect and was a huge hit! I will keep this recipe, for sure, and will use it again. 
Couple things I did differently. I used milk, soured with vinegar, since I had no buttermilk. I used Greek Fage unflavored yogurt in place of the sour cream. Other than these minor changes I followed the recipe. Also, because I didn't start the recipe till one hour before our company arrived, I decided to divide the dough into two halves and bake for half the time. I baked the two loaves for 25  minutes, checked with a toothpick, still a tad bit doughy, and baked for another 5 minutes. Perfect!! Melts in your mouth with butter! I will note, that the recipe says "Dough will be sticky" and this is for sure. But don't be concerned; this, I think, is what makes the bread so delicious and moist after it's done baking. All in all, I would say this one is a keeper. Luck of the Irish to you :)

I made this recipe yesterday and we loved it! I made two loaves, but one at a time to see if anything needed tweaking. The ONLY thing I changed in the second loaf is that I only used 2 cups of raisins because 3 cups (in the first loaf) was way too many. It almost looked like there was as much raisin as there was bread. Other than that, it was delicious and well worth it!
By the way, I've seen quite a few reviews of this where people say they omitted the raisins and/or caraway seeds. Newsflash: that is not "adjusting" the recipe, it is making an entirely different recipe. Without the raisins and caraway seeds, it is NOT Irish Soda Bread. It's just bread (of some sort). It would be like following a recipe for Beef Stew and saying you made it without the beef. That's not BEEF stew!
Please keep your complete re-creations out of the reviews. Post your own recipe and call it something else.

I just made a loaf of this bread and we all love it.  I made it as the recipe was written with one exception.   Instead of 3 cups of raisins, I added only 2 cups and we are very happy with that amount.  I cannot imagine what it would be like with all three cups!  Other than that, it is a delicious quick bread that is easy to make and quick to enjoy!

I substituted  the sour cream(cottage cheese and vinegar)  also used less sugar an added Splenda, also only one and a half cups total raisins and cranberries.
It turned out absolutely delicious. 
Definitely needed 75 minutes in a loaf pan.
Oh by the way have to make 2 more this weekend!

Very good warm, slathered with butter. Nice crust and moist inside. Makes a nice size loaf, more like 16 servings. Will be sharing! Made in a 9.5 inch glass pie pan-done in 60 mins.

This was by far the best. The texture is not crumbly or dry. I did add more sugar and made my buttermilk with whole milk and lemon juice. Cooked 1 1/2 hours. Mm mm seven with honey butter.

I make this bread every March, and usually once in the fall when baking season starts up, just because I can't wait to snack on it again! Great for soaking up stew, delicious with a little coconut oil spread on top, and good even just by itself.

Very good but not sure if this tastes like Irish Soda Bread. The ones I have had were dry and crumbly and slightly salty with sweet raisins or currents. This is a very sweet bread and the raisins make it sweeter. STILL - the men loved it. I did NOT put in the seeds as they have an off-putting odor. This would make a great cinnamon bread with added cinnamon. I'll have to make this again as my husband and father loved it, but will ask a friend in Ireland for her ISB recipe. I'll post it if I get a good one! :)

Not a fan of this. I only used 2 cups of raisins (since that's all I had) and there were too many. I also wasn't able to use the sour cream (mine had expired) and the dough was still too sticky. The crumb on this was very moist, but I prefer a crumbly soda bread. The middle of this bread never fully cooked. It had excellent flavor, but I don't think I will make this again.

Made it yesterday-first attempt. Trying to use up sour cream and buttermilk.  Took advice of some reviewers and reduced raisins (had only golden in pantry) to (2) cups and added 1/2 cup chopped apricots.  Increased buttermilk slightly because I had only 1/2 cup sour cream.  Good thing I read reviews re stickiness of dough otherwise I probably would have added too much flour.  I did use a cast iron skillet and also followed a reviewer's comments -- cut the cross in on top after 15 minutes in oven.  The dough was so sticky.  Followed another reviewer's comments -- just plop it into a greased pan, spray back of spatula with Pam and smooth top.  Came out great.  

I don't digest butter easily and this recipe doesn't have it as an ingredient and so I hope it freezes well. I could consume the whole loaf -- had to get it out of sight.

I did enjoy the results but modified it slightly by (as many have said) reducing the raisins to 2 cups with hydrating them first before adding. I did not have a round pan (was at my bf's) so I used a bread loaf. I let the dough (which was very sticky) sit in the greased load pan 30 minutes to marry the moistness with the bread flour with the buttermilk as it common). The caraway seeds (like them in general) did ad a great flavor and I will do the same recipe next time I make this bread. I have made other ISBs on this site and this recipe will be added to those other recipes I will enjoy again and again.

I made this for my sons culture fair.  It was a big hit!  Super easy to make. I did use bread flour, because thats all I had, and it turned out great.  We received lots of great reviews at the fair. My son has all ready asked me to make it again.

I have been trying to make a good  Irish soda bread for over 20 years. Being of italian decent never knew about it until it was introduced by my born in Ireland mother in law.    Since my Irish mother in law passed 20 years ago taking her recipe to the grave, my husband tells me not as good as Mom's. never gave up.  Well I need to say this is it.  Finally my PITA husband agreed,  this is outstanding.  Follow exactly and it is fool proof.

I ate Irish Soda Bread for the first time last weekend and loved it.  Wanted to try making it myself.  This recipe was nothing like what I had tasted - not as sweet,more moist and heavy plus caraway seeds.  Dough was sticky so wasn't sure how to handle it.  Made it exactly by the receipe except used 1 cup of golden raisins.  Even though it wasn't what I expected, I loved the result.  Had to put part of it in the freezer as I was afraid I would pig out and eat the whole loaf.  Will make again but may add a little more flour to make it easier to handle.

This bread is different fro the traditional Irish soda breads I've made in the past. On Sunday, St Patrick's Day, I made this bread and the "traditional" recipe that was given me by my Irish MIL. This bread "won" our soda bread "taste off". Everyone loved and demanded the recipe. They all loved the wonderful flavor the caraway seeds added. And I loved the therapeutic benefit of making it.

This bread was good, easy to make and delicious tasting.  I only used 2 cups of raisins though, thought that was plenty enough.  However, nest time I will add a bit more flour so that I can kneed it a bit by hand and bake it on a regular baking sheet instead of a 9 inch round cake/pie baker.

This was my first time making irish soda bread.  I researched different recipes and decided this one was the best to try.  I made one yesterday afternoon.  It came out soooo good, I made three more last night to share with friends.  I made a couple of changes:  for the 3 cups of raisins, I used half regular raisins and hal golden raisins.  Before I put the raisins into the dough mixture, I dropped them into hot water for three mintues, then drained them really well.  This made the raisins much more plump.  Also...I only used 2 tsps of caraway seeds, and it was perfect.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I think it's the sour cream htat really makes it great.  xo

This is very yummy, but not at all like real Irish Soda Bread. If you enjoy the flavor of soda bread, but not the coarse, crumbly texture of it, you will probably really like this recipe. I will make it again, but not as soda bread. It is just a yummy recipe for a nice loaf to enjoy with jam or butter.

This was quick and easy to mix up and tasted good. I didn't really care for the taste of the caraway seeds so I would cut back or omit those next time, and I felt like 3 cups of raisins was a little too much, so I would cut back on those as well. I really enjoyed the taste and texture of the bread though, and would make it again with those changes.

I am not a bread baker and not really even a bread eater, but I fixed this for a St. Patrick's Day dinner and I thought it was wonderful!   The dough is very sticky to work with, but it was well worth it.

Very yummy!  I did omit the raisins (my husband is NOT a fan!) so I doubled the caraway seeds.  It was perfect!  
I have made this with fat-free sour cream & low-fat buttermilk ... still very good with a wonderful texture.  This recipe went straight to my recipe box!

This is the best Irish Soda bread recipe yet.  Everyone loved it - including all the raisins.  
It was a bit sticky and I didn't want to over mix/knead, so I didn't get to score the top...it looked a bit odd, but still tasted great!

Best Soda Bread Ever!  Bread was moist and tender.  Used only 2 cups raisins which were plenty.  Even though I forgot to put on the timer and the bread probably baked 15 minutes too long, the bread was moist and delicious. It is now my go to recipe for soda bread...and for raisin bread.  No leftover to try it as French Toast.

I wish I could give this more than just 5 stars! This is a WONDERFUL recipe that will delight you! I had to omit the caraway seeds as I could not find them at the grocery store. Thanks for sharing this recipe with all of us. It was a lovely way to celebrate the feast of St. Patrick and I will be using this again.

We love this recipe, except for the caraway seeds. My mother-in-law is from Ireland and she couldn't recall ever having soda bread with caraway seeds. So we haven't used them since and love the recipe!

Wish I could give this 10 stars.  This was my first recipe to ever make from All Recipes and it came out beautifully.  Next time I might try it without the caraway seeds because my husband wasn't crazy about that particular flavor.  But we loved it!  Will definitely make it again and again.

This was my first time making OR eating soda bread, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a really great dense bread with the raisins adding just enough sweetness.  Great with butter alongside dinner.  I was also able to cut up the leftovers and use for french toast.

This recipe was easy and really delicious. The only change I would make is to use less cardamon. Other than that moist and yummy!

This is a great recipe. I did make a few changes to suit my family. I left out the caraway seeds, used only 1 cup of raisins (it was plenty) and didn't dust the top with flour.

DEEE-lish! Very tasty and great texture. The sour cream is a great addition for flavor and moisture. i made a double batch, one with raisins and one without so all my guests for St. Pat's Day could have their preference. All but one small wedge was gone in a snap! We all loved this bread. I was even out of caraway seeds which would have made it even better but we all loved it anyway. A definate keeper!

Best I have had, everyone loved it, we had quite a feast last night, St. Paddy's Day.  Don't use flour on top, I used some sugar and it was perfect.  Also soaked the currents in GranMarnier.

This was soooo good! I made it for St. Patties Day and brought it to work and it practically evaporated! We couldn't stop eating it and I was very sad when I ate my last piece. Super easy to make, I left out the caraway seeds because while I personally like them I wasn't sure how everyone else would feel about them.

This was absolutely PERFECT! I couldn't believe how moist and fluffy it turned out. I did a few substitutions: a cube of melted butter instead of the sour cream (suggested by M Unit in another review), and added 1 cup of golden raisins and 1 cup of currants which gave it an interesting look and flavor. The only problem I see with this is that eating only one piece is impossible. My diet is out the window with this bread, but it is a great side-dish bread for special occasions. Can't wait to make it again for St. Patrick's Day!

I found this recipe and made it with corned beef and cabbage for St. Patrick's Day. My family loved it and daily requested more for the next 2 weeks. I made it as is except I used Cranberries instead of raisins.

I made this to go with a St. Patrick's Day carry-in at my church.  It got rave reviews and people were asking me for the recipe.  I thought it was even better the next day for breakfast with some butter melted over the top.

Absolutely amazing!  I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was a hit.  I did make a few changes, only because I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I substituted plain fat free yogurt for sour cream, and half & half with buttermilk powder in place of actual buttermilk.  I also omitted the raisins and caraway seeds since I didn't have any on hand.  I baked it just until the knife came out clean, about 45 mins.  The entire loaf was eated by only 4 people at dinner!  Excellent recipe!

This was my first attempt in making irish soda bread and what a success. I also left out the caraway seeds. I thought it would be dry the next day, but it wasn't, it was very moist. I think the next time I will add dried apricots and nuts. I guess because I omitted the caraway seeds, I have lost the authenticity of the bread, but it will be made often at my house because there are so many possibilities with this recipe.

This recipe was simple, easy, and delicious!  A huge hit and I will make it again soon.  I didn't have enough a/p flour, so I used half whole wheat flour.  Also, I didn't have buttermilk, so I used skim milk and added 1 tbsp. vinegar and 1 3/4 tsp. cream of tartar.  The soda bread is absolutely fantastic.  I can't rave about it enough!

Made this for the first time.  I  think it was pretty good!  I am not a fan of the Caraway seeds.  I think it would be amazing without them!  But suprisingly the kids loved it!  I also think it would be good with craisins.

this was awesome bread! I did as another person said and just dipped the knife in flour and made an x. I also used lowfat sourcream and made my own buttermilk with skim milk and lemon juice. I also did not add any seeds or rasins as i didnt think it would fit the meal we were having. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I replaced the buttermilk with plain Greek yogurt and I used soy sour cream (only because I am lactose), I followed the recipe and everybody raved over how good it was. Great recipe and I will definitely make this again.

I used half whole wheat and half unbleached white, since I don't eat all white anymore. I also used just 1 c. raisins. I made my own buttermilk using milk and vinegar and ended up with too much liquid, next time I will fix that. I had to add more flour because of that. I also cut back a little on the sugar and skipped the caraway seeds since I did not have any. I had a slice after it had cooled, but was still warm inside and it was very good. Chewy, so I'm not sure that is the way it is supposed to taste.   I left it sliced up and uncovered overnight to take to work. It ended up drier this morning, so I don't think it is supposed to be left out like you can do with banana bread. I would definitely recommend eating it while it is still warm. Afterwards, I think it would be good with soup or something. But it may have just been because I messed up on the liquid/dry combination. Would recommend and would definitely make again. Very easy to make, like making drop biscuits.

I just made this bread today. Having never tasted it before, nor ever making any type of bread, I can't really say anything about it other than it was quite easy and it tastes REALLY good ^-^ I didn't put in any seeds, but it still tastes really good to me.

I made this today & it was very good.  I should say, I am not Irish & I have never had homemade Irish Soda Bread.  When I told my husband I was making it, he said, "ugh, why?"  because he has never been impressed with Irish Soda Bread.  He said, though, that this was very good.  Actually, his exact words were, "Not too shabby for a German girl."  We had a traditional corned beef and cabbage dinner & this was a great compliment to our meal.  I baked this in my Grandmother's cast iron skillet & it was very rustic.  Really delicious, super easy & I will be making it again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I only use this recipe when making Irish Soda bread it is so delicious! I know it's not very traditional, it's not so dry like traditional. It's also not too cake-like, either. I make a lot of baked goods with sour cream for that great texture, it's my favorite part of this recipe. Try adding sour cream instead of milk or with, to any scone, muffin, or quick bread recipe. You'll see what I mean.

Excellent. I only added 1-1.5 C raisins, used light sour cream, and didn't add the caraway seeds. It came out moist and creamy-tasting. Next time I'll add the caraway seeds.

WOW. i cant believe i actually made irish soda bread. i was a little intimidated at first because baking is not my forte but this actually turned out fantastic. i used dried cranberries instead of raisins and i only used two cups. cooked it all in a loaf pan for 1hour and 20 minutes. im very excited and it will go along great with the corned beef im making for dinner. yay

My mom says "I've never been a fan of Soda Bread." Meanwhile, I can't get her to stop eating it! Everyone loved this! The raisins are a MUST!

This Irish Bread brought lots of compliments!  I brought it to work for St. Patrick's Day, and it was wiped out in no time!  My only reason for rating it 4 stars is that the kneading was impossible!  The dough is way too wet to knead.  I suggest mixing as instructed and placing in the baking dish - it comes out just fine.  I also used just 2 cups of raisins -- 3 is too much for me, but that's a matter of personal taste.  Great Bread!!

I just made this last night, and it was great! I made a few changes. I used 8oz of plain yogurt (less calories) instead and used only 2 cups of GOLDEN raisins. It was very soft and moist in the center and had a crispy crust. It turned out great!

Made for St. Patrick's Day and my guests loved it! I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular then I added 1 cup golden raisins and half cup dried cherries (thats what I had) and it was adequate. Dense bread like a scone but moist and interesting. Will make again next St. Patrick's Day.

I had no buttermilk, so I thought I would totally screw up this recipe but went for it anyway.  I used Reduced Fat Lactose Free milk, added about 1.5 TBL vinegar and let it sit while I put together the dry ingredients.  The batter was so gooey and sticky I was sure it would turn out bad, but I was wrong!  I thought the raisins may turn away some of my family, so I made 2 loafs, one with raisins (only used about 1 cup) and one without.  They both turned out wonderfully--and the version with raisins was so good I told my non-raisin eating family members to try it, they did--and thought it was actually better WITH the raisins (and they had liked it without as well).  We had it with corned beef, cabbage, potatoes and carrots for our St. Patrick's Day feast!  Great recipe, thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I've received only rave reviews!  I used low fat buttermilk, reduced fat sour cream, 1 1/2 cups raisins, and no caraway seeds - and it was just perfect!  I recommend it highly!!!

This was good and similar to my Grandmother's recipe.  I think using the sour cream makes it too moist for my liking though. This has the texture of banana bread.

Hate to be the one who didn't like the recipe, but we did not care for it.  I have made many Irish soda breads, and this was not comparable.  Used a cast iron pan, and the cooking time was too long.  The caraway ruined it for me, it tasted like sweet raisin rye bread, which I thought was an odd combination. Tip: pour batter into prepared pan, pat down with generously floured hands (rather than dusting with flour), make the x with a floured knife. If you love caraway, this might be the bread for you.

Truly easy. Definitely may want to add 1/4 -1/2 c of flour depending on how wet your dough is. Substituted 1/2 of the flour with 1 part Kamut and 1 part Wheat. Grainy texture worked great with  the caraway and raisins.

Very tasty! It is loaded with rasins! Although, I loved it, my husband & kids were a bit overwhelmed. Next time I make it, I will only add 1/2 of the rasins.

This recipe was a little too sweet for my taste -- was more like a sweetbread than a soda bread. Also, it didn't really rise well (I can't figure out why, since I know the baking soda and powder are good, but it could be something else.)

Great texture, quick, easy, and tasty. Only used 2 cups of raisins, and that was PLENTY.  I also halved the caraway seeds, and even that was a bit much.  Will bake it sans caraway next time.  Also, the recipe picture shows the bread being sliced in wedges like a cake, but for easier buttering, it's much better to slice it across.  Overall, wonderful.  Will definitely make again!

I made the bread almost as the recipe says - I did NOT reserve the flour or sprinkle any on top.  Even then the dough was too wet to cut the "cross" into the top.  This is more a sweet bread dough - not a yeast bread dough (obviously, since there is no yeast).  I did have to cover the top of my bread with foil because it was getting pretty dark yet the inside was still doughy.  I think it baked the amount of time stated in the recipe.  The taste is wonderful!!  We slathered warm wedges of it with butter and enjoyed it as dessert with our Irish Boiled Dinner (from this site).  It was a very happy St. Patty's Day!

Very good, texture is wonderful-almost cake like.  Keeps well, great in the toaster.  Will make again. Did not use raisins or caraway, only because I didn't have on hand.

I made this without the raisins or caraway seeds (husband detests both), and it was still a huge hit. I also replaced half the AP flour with whole wheat pastry flour for a finer crumb and more flavor. Served it with the Guinness Corned Beef recipe on this site, which as also a HUGE hit. Everyone was oohing and ahhing, my husband couldn't stop smiling and asked me why I hadn't made this dinner before. I will definitely make both again!

I haven’t made Irish Soda bread in at least 30 years. I just didn’t have the desire to since the last recipe I used wasn’t very appealing. I tried your recipe, Penguin Lady, because of the beautiful picture you took of your bread. I put mine in an 8” cake pan because I don’t have a 9” pan. Wow! It was big! Really beautiful too, just like yours! I made the bread exactly per your recipe. I think next time I’ll reduce the raisins to 2 cups, just to save on the cost of ingredients and calories. I can hardly wait to try this in the toaster for breakfast! Thanks so much for taking the time to submit this, it’s to die for.

This bread was the very best bread I have ever made, and the first time I have made bread without my bread machine. I was invited to a new home,house warming party with friends. It was for Saint Patrick's Day. I didn't know what to bring because the corn beef and cabbage was already a dish that someone was bringing. I just found this on youe web site and read the reviews and it sounded so good. It was the talk of the dinner just how great my bread was. I also live in Utah and I couldn't find a Irish Soda bread to even buy to bring. I am so glad that you have this web site for people like me, who like to try new recipesand never new where to find them. Alicia

This bread is wonderful and easy to make. It's the first soda bread I've made and I will definitely make it again.  I did cut the sugar to 1/3 c. as suggested by others.  I also used 2 c whole wheat flour and 2 c unbleached white.  Also omitted raisins.  It was a hit w/the corned beef and cabbage dinner.

This will be the Irish Soda Bread recipe I use from now on.  It was sooo easy to make.  I used my kitchen Aid, and dumped the batter into a cast iron skillet.  It turned out amazing. It looks beautiful too! I followed the recipe exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing. OOPs, the only thing I did differently was I brushed sour cream on the top for a shiny look, instead of the flour. THANK YOU for a wonderful recipe :-)

This recipe turned out fine - consistency of bread was nice and uniform.  There's not much taste to this bread and it's kind of heavy.  This is my first Irish Soda Bread.  I probably won't make this again unless I have something flavorful to put with it.

This bread is absolutely wonderful.  Have some friends who can't eat sugar so substituted Splenda.  Just as yummy as with sugar.  Great Job!

Had sworn off making Irish soda bread as it always came out dry and flavorless.  But, saw this recipe--straight from Ireland and boy I'm glad I did--Delicious!!!  My husband thought he didn't like Irish soda bread until he tried this and he ate several pieces.  Skipped the flour on top and the caraway seeds (don't care for) and only had 1 1/2 cups of raisins in the house.  Couldn't be better.

This was just plain AWESOME. It was my first attempt at soda bread, and I'm 100% pleased with the results. I left the amounts of raisins and caraway seeds alone and it was just fine. This bread tasted great dunked in Irish Beef Stew (from this site) for St Patty's day dinner, and even better toasted and buttered with a mug of tea for breakfast the next morning. I'm not waiting until March 17th next year to make this one again! Thanks for a great recipe, Ellen!

Very interesting bread!  I was surprised at the taste the bread took on with the caraway in it, pleasantly surprised!  I also halved the raisins, since they can be hit or miss in my house.  Made this on St. Patricks Day and had plenty to make into some fine toast the next day!  I wonder what this would taste like as a bread pudding… hmm.  As with others’, my dough was extremely sticky, but I was very happy with the outcome, it baked properly!

Excellent recipe.  I used my kitchenaid mixer but just for a minute then folded the rest of the flour in.  The buttermilk and sourcream have it a nice texure, not too crumbly.  I'm going to make another loaf tomorrow with carraway.  You could get away with just two cups of raisins.  I'm posting a photo of mine with golden raisins.  Some real butter on a slice was fantastic.  Hubby wants another loaf already!

This was phenomenal and the easiest recipe ever. I used Splenda instead of sugar and used 1 cup of raisins and 1 cup of craisins. Next time I might add nuts....with a little bit of butter...Delicious! The whole loaf was finished at last night's St. Pat's dinner!

I've never tasted Irish soda bread before but this was delicious.  The caraway seed (which i have never used before) was a nice contrast to the sugar and raisins.  I made it to take to my neighbors and they loved it.  The only change I made was I used 2 cups of raisins instead of 3 because it was all I had.  It was even beautiful to look at.  I will definitely be making this again.

Every year I make soda bread, using one recipe or another--but this one was raved about!  I did leave out the raisins (I don't like) and the caraway seed (husband dislikes), but who cared?  And when Ellen says the dough is sticky, she ain't kiddin', it made me think I had really messed up somehow. But that certainly was NOT the case, this is the best!

Great, easy bread.  I cut down the raisins to two cups and cut the sugar and caraway seeds down a bit, all based on reviews, but I think I will try the original recipe next time.

Wow - we all loved this recipe. I found it very easy to make. I used almost 1/2 whole wheat to replace part of the white flour for a heartier bread and used about 2 1/2 cups golden and regular raisins. This bread is a great holiday tradition. Thank you for the recipe!!

Note: I made this again this year (03/17/08) and enjoy the bread a lot but will cut back on the raisins next time. I used 2 1/2 cups mix of golden and regular raisins. I think 2 cupos would be plenty!

I made this soda bread today and just took it out of the over.  I don't ever remember tasting an Irish Soda Bread before so I'm not sure what to expect.  I added 2 cups of crasins instead of the 3 cups of raisons and I left out the caraway seeds.  I baked it for 60 minutes and it turned out very moist inside with a firm top.  I really like it and will make it again in the future.

i nixed the raisins (too sweet) and halved the caraway seeds (all of it was a bit much for me) and this bread turned out great.

This was my first time to bake bread. It turned out perfect...it is very beautiful. Looks gourmet. I did not have Caraway Seeds so I left them out. The 3 cups of raisins is just right.

I made this with two cups of raisins and the full amount of the caraway seeds, and didn't really enjoy it so I went back to the store bought a few more things and made this bread without either of them really liked it but I don't think I will make this bread again.  By the way, stick your knife in some flour it will help to cut the slit.

I had never made Irish soda bread before, but I followed the recipe to a T and I baked it in a cast iron skillet.  Wow!  It was fantastic. The sweet of the raisins and the tang of the caraway was great.

This recipe was FAB!!!  Though I agree with most of the reviewers that 3C of raisins is way too much.  I used 2C and it was packed with raisins.  I am a fan of caraway, so 1T wasn't quite enough.  Next time I'll add a bit more to my taste.
Thanks for a great recipe, I'll use it again!!!

Wish I could give 4.5 stars.  I really liked this, but didn't care for the caraway seeds.  I only did 1 tsp but it was extremely overpowering.  The taste of the bread without it was perfect.  A little dry on the outside, but still tasty.  Used only 2 cups of raisins.  Will definitely make again!

After reading the reviews, I decided to use just one extra egg & 2 cups raisins. The dough was not as sticky as indicated in some reviews. I used four cups purpose flour. Baked in just 50  min. using a nine inch baking dish. Turned out so nice I'm making another today.

The batter was a lot stickier than I expected, but at the end of 65 minutes the loaf was high, and a beautiful dark golden color. I used only 2 cups of raisins and thought that was perfect. I also only used a scant tablespoon of caraway seeds and will definitely use the full tablespoon next time. I couldn't stop eating the stuff! It was fantastic!

delicious--this will be wonderful with tea tomorrow morning for breakfast (and as an afternoon treat, too).  I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and didn't put the carraway seeds in this time because I'm planning to use half the loaf in a bread pudding in a couple of days.  Next time I'll use about half the carraway called for.  I used a 9" cake pan and baked it for about 65 min--it's golden on the outside, yellow inside dotted with golden raisins, beautiful and very sweet.  I may use less raisins when I make it for dinners--will try it with a vegetarian shepherd's pie this weekend.

Awesome bread!  Nice and moist.  I made it with the Guinness corned beef recipe that is on this site.  The bread turned out great.  I did cut down the raisins to 2 cups, and did use all the caraway.  We love the taste of caraway.  I did end up having to bake it about 15-20 min longer than stated, but it turned out so tasty!  Thanx for the awesome recipe.

I've had several recipes for Irish Soda Bread but this is the best by far. My 7 year old grandson and I make a loaf every week. I sometimes make it in two 6" pans for gift giving. I'm always asked for the recipe.

Seems like I try a different soda bread recipe every year for St. Patrick's Day -- this is definitely the best I have ever made, and I won't go looking for a new recipe next year!  Moist and delicious.

Far and away the best soda bread recipe on the site. I wouldn't change an iota. If you like golden raisins cut them in for half like I did. I made 1/2 loaves in 7 inch foils for friends and was applauded for giving them the best St Patty's extra they had ever had.

This bread was delicious and SOOOO easy to make.  I did cut out the caraway seeds, and I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, salt to a 1/2 teaspoon, and the raisins to 1 1/2 cups, based on my tastes and other reviewer's comments.  I made it the night before I served it to give it time to moisten, but the best part was the leftovers - this bread makes excellent toast.  This recipe will definitely become part of my annual St. Patrick's Day feast!

Great, easy recipe. After looking at comments I used 2 tsp caraway seeds, 1 cup raisins, and 1 cup currants. My Irish friend said it was better than her mother's bread and wanted the recipe.

I just served this at a dinner party - got rave reviews.  I left out the caraway seed (because the client doesn't like them), and used sultanas instead of raisins.  It's very moist and reminded me of a very moist scone, but in a big cake like size.  I made the recipe for 10 people, used a rectangle baking dish, and cut it into slices to serve.  Un-cut it stayed warm for a very long time.  Many asked for seconds.  We served this at a supper, but would be great at a brunch or served at a coffee.

I followed this recipe exactlly and was a little skeptical about the consistancy of the dough.  It was very wet and sticky.  However, I put it in the oven for the highest recommended time and it came out great.  This is by far my new favorite bread recipe!!!

i did not find the instructions helpful at all. the ingredient amounts are all terribly wrong, specifically those for the liquid ingredients. the recipe has you prepare a huge bowl of this liquids, but fails to instruct you that if you use any more than half of it, it will lead to the complete ruin of not only the soda bread, but the inside of your oven as well. USE ANOTHER RECIPE!!!!

First time making irish soda bread and it turned out great.  Played fast and loose with measuring the sour cream and ended up with a VERY wet dough which felt more like glutinous batter.  Couldn't cut a slit on top because it was so wet.  Still, baked for 1 hour 10 minutes in a pie pan and everything cooked.  Brushed butter on top after baking to soften the hard crust a bit.  The dough inside is a yellow, dense, moist cornbread like consistency without the corn taste.  Tastes GREAT warm with butter.  I added two small packets of raisins, will add more next time.  Used 1/2 tsp caraway seeds, may skip next time if not using more raisins.

I made this recipe for St. Patrick's Day and it was great. As noted by other reviewers, I cut back on the amount of raisins. This bread was moist and delicious. A real keeper! Thanks Ellen for your wonderful recipe. I will make this many times.

Terrific soda bread. My fiance loved it and I brought some into work today and got nothing but raves. I used about half the raisins and I'll probably use a little less caraway next time. Moist and delicious!

I've been making Irish Soda bread for years and this is the best I've found.  The trick seems to be the sour cream.  I made two loaves in 2 days and they are completely gone.  *** a good reminder is the amount of raisins and caraway seeds are to taste *** I usually cut the raisins down to about 1/4 c and 1/2 tsp of caraway seeds.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  The bread was very dry and I did not like the combination of carraway seeds with raisins.  I ate one piece of it and threw the rest away.

i thought this bread was excellent.  Used only 2 cups raisins and left out caraway seeds.  Also did not dust with flour and it browned nicely.   Will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a St Patrick’s Day dinner party with our neighbors and it turned out perfect! The only changes I made were scaling the raisins down to 1 cup and then soaking them in whiskey overnight before draining and adding to the dough the next morning. The whiskey helped plumped up the raisins and resulted in a nicely moist finished product! I will definitely make this recipe again.

Absolutely a keeper. My family loved it. The only thing that I changed and was by accident was I used 2 cups of raisins instead of 3 because that was all I had. Family agreed that 3 cups might be a tad too much.  The dough is super sticky and hard to make the X on top. Baked mine half way through and added the X. Hope this helps someone. Will be making this again and again!

You asked, so yes, I did make a change.  I didn't have buttermilk so I added extra sour cream and Greek Yogurt and 1/4 cup milk to make the exact amount of liquid the recipe required.  It turned out delicious and I will make it over and over.  Buttermilk is now on my shopping list!  I will substitute one of my yeast Easter breads for this because it was so simple and simply delicious!  Hubby loved it, and that's important!  We love the taste of caraway seed, and it was just enough.  Also, it made delicious toast!

DELISH! So easy too! I cut the recipe in half & subbed milk/vinegar for buttermilk. Actual baking time was 45 min. for the half batch.  My 6" cast iron skillet was a wee bit  too small, so it poofed up like a soufflé but sliced easily & tasted wonderful, especially with butter. Great addition to our St. Patrick's day dinner.

I made two different recipies  last night for a St Patrick’s day church brunch, this one and the  “Amazingly Easy” one here on AR. I found them both easy to prepare with little difference in preparation and taste was similar (I added caraway seeds and raisins to the AE loaf). However,  this one was more moist and won the competition in my opinion, because of the higher amount of buttermilk and the sour cream. I used half light sour cream and will do all light next time.  The AE recipe had a better crust because of basting with buttermilk/butter and I would do that with this one next time. Caraway seeds add a disctinctively Irish taste to soda bread, and even though aren’t a favourite of mine, are necessary.

I was looking for a new recipe for soda bread and came across this on my Alexa...it had many  good ratings and so I gave it a try.  It was so easy and delicious that this is my new go to recipe for soda bread!!  In fact, I had requests for this recipe already!  I did use the cast iron skillet and it came out great!  I did not put caraway seeds in it because some people cannot tolerate seeds and I used half golden and half regular raisins.  Don't skimp on the raisins!  I even toasted some the next morning and it was soooo good!! Great recipe!! Give it a try!  p.s....yes, it will be sticky...I made this in my Kitchen Aid mixer...only mixed to incorporate then used a spatula and did by hand.....do not overmix!   Enjoy!

This was demolished even by the raisin haters. Used 1 cup raisins, skipped caraway, used vinegar/milk for buttermilk. It was done in 50 min. It is VERY sticky but does turn out so just trust it!

I made this bread several years ago to take to a party hosted by a REAL cook and his (chef) son. They were so delighted with this bread that now, they insist I bring it every year. Since IANAC
(I Am Not A Cook) I changed nothing. It is perfect every time. And yes. I'm taking it again this year. In fact, I bake two loaves for all the soda bread lovers who will be there and expect to have it again every year!

Amazing recipe.  I made a few adjustments: 4 1/2 cups of flour. plus a little for dusting. Added an additional tablespoon sour cream. If using caraway seeds I used 2 tbs. It only took 60 minutes.  Thank you for sharing this is a keeper.

Superb!!! Couldn't stomach the thought of the caraway seeds so I left them out. I also didn't have buttermilk so I used the milk with lemon juice alternative. Big hit with friends and family

I made this recipe twice! Both times they came out excellent! The only thing I changed was add a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to the second batch. This bread is amazing, toasted with creamy Irish butter melted into it. Yum!

This was delicious! I took a suggestion from a previous reviewer and added apricot as well as raisins (since apricot is my fave). The caraway seeds were amazing for flavor paired with the sweetness of the fruit. This was a big hit with the family. The amount it makes is large, so I was able to eat it with my immediate family for a big Irish breakfast and still cut it into sections and give to my father and brother later in the day. To quote my father, “addictive...I can’t stop eating it.”

This was really good, would it be sacrilege if I put in cinnamon?  I would absolutely make this again.  Its fantastic toasted with lots of butter.  It was more like batter than dough so I did have to add some more flour.  update, made it in the kitchenaide, threw in some cinnamon, didn't have enough sour cream, still excellent, even the better the next toasted with butter and jam

Excellent, especially hot out of the oven. I left out the raisins and carraway because I don't like them, so this was a lightly sweet quick bread with a lovely crunchy crust. Will definitely save to make again. It makes a LOT so I might try halving the recipe next time.
Note: I will also leave off the sprinkle of flour on top next time. It does look pretty, but creates more of a mess when slicing.

Definitely not what I was expecting from soda bread. The dough was more like a batter so the texture wasn’t quite right when I took it out of the oven - more dense and moist than it’s really supposed to be. It got a little better once it cooled completely, and it still tasted fine, but if you’re looking for a classic Irish soda bread, this isn’t it. This also calls for way too many raisins. I used about a cup and a half and that was more than enough.

Great recipe.  I did make one change.  I soaked the raisins in bourbon overnight. After draining the raisins I blended  the remaining bourbon into a cup of softened butter to spread on the bread.  WOW!  Now a St. Patrick's Day favorite.

I've tried others - this is a keeper. Moist, flavorful and easy to make. I did reduce the caraway seeds to a teaspoon and found that just right, not too strong. And to get around the fact that the dough was too sticky to make the 'X' on top, I put it in the oven for 15 minutes and then did it - the top was just starting to bake and I could slice it then. Result was beautiful. Also I only needed to bake for an hour to get a rich golden brown.

This is AMAZING!!! I made a few moderate adaptations, I used one cup white wheat flour and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I took others advice to only use 2 cups of raisins which I definitely agree was better. It was incredibly fluffy, it almost had the texture of a sourdough rather than a quick bread. I love caraway but it was polarizing for my guests, although I think the measurement of 1 tbsp was well proportioned for the recipe. I will definitely start making it regular,

Growing up in an Irish-American family, soda bread was a staple.  When I married into another Irish-American family, my MIL gave me her mother's recipe...I made this bread over the weekend and my MIL said it was better than our local Irish bakery's bread and even better than her mom's...hands down the best soda bread recipe out there...the sour cream may not be traditional but it makes all the difference

Followed this recipe to the letter. Well, as close to the letter as I do ..... lol
I made it for my friends who are from Ireland and England and they said it tasted like their moms  had made the bread.
Never having had it before and looking at the ingredients, i was suprised at how tasty it was. Only problem with this is......HOW do you stop eating it ?  Delicious!  Darn tasty !

I loved the recipe, and the work potluck people liked it to, the hint from someone about wrapping in foil, fresh out of the oven, was the best, Irish soda bread tends to be "dry" and this was a very delicious moist bread

Made a half batch and 50 minutes in, I was tempted to pull it out of the oven based on the delicious aroma and the golden brown top. After 65 minutes, it looked a touch overdone BUT...omg, it is sooooo good! A smear of orange marmalade and this is a keeper recipe.

This was fabulous! I used fewer raisins—just 2 cups—and that was enough. Was perfect with the Irish lamb stew I made (from this site) We will make this bread again.

This ended up as a fine bread, but it was overly sticky despite following the directions exactly... so sticky that trying to cut an x on top was almost comical. It baked up fine without the x and tasted fine, but I don’t understand what happened. I always double check all the ingredients and measurements when baking so I’m certain that wasn’t it.

Absolutely incredible. Every time I make this people go crazy. My only complaint is how many calories it is, but otherwise this is just an amazing treat with a slather of butter.

The only change I made was using golden raisins in place of currants.  The rest of the recipe was followed exactly.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was that it was somewhat heavy.  I could not find my other recipe for soda bread so selected this one.  It was not bad, but my other recipe is better

This is a fantastic recipe--light, moist, and with a great crust. I will be making this again. I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and, instead of 3 cups raisins, 1 cup raisins, 1 cup dried cherries, and 1 cup diced dried apricots.  It didn't last long in my house!

I used to make this frequently... now we are a gluten-free household so I haven't made it in a couple years. I decided to give it a try with my Namaste Gluten Free Flour Blend (my personal favorite, a good wheat flour substitute). I was happy with how well it turned out! As usual, I used currants rather than raisins, and use a little under 2 cups. My one complaint with this recipe is one that others have too... I think it is difficult to know when it is completely done, without a small area of undercooked dough in the very center. Otherwise it is always a hit, and actually worked well with the GF flour.  In the future I may start dividing the dough in half for two smaller loaves, to hopefully bake more evenly.

I made this almost exactly like the recipe says.  I don't like caraway seeds so I didn't add them.  Also, I used less raisins.  (I doubled  the recipe as it was for a lot of people and used only 3 cups)   These are both personal preferences    The bread was amazing!  Moist and delicious!  I got so many compliments on it!

Unlike other recipes for Irish Soda Bread this one needs to be baked in a 12 inch pan with sides. It does not hold its shape and spreads out to the size of the pan. The flavor was good but it was overly browned after only 50 minutes of cooking. My cast iron skillet was bigger but the outside browning would be the same for any size. I would lower the temperature slightly and use the proper size pan next time.

I always make it in my le creuset fry pan. I think it makes a big difference. I do not add the raisins or caraway seeds as we do not like them.  There is a hint of sweetness that is a nice surprise and there is never any left over to make french toast the next morning. It is best enjoyed fresh out of the oven, sliced and slathered with butter!

I have made this quite a few times and it comes out perfect each time! This time I made a eggwash brushed on top and  sprinkled  some turbinado sugar before baking. It made a nice crunchy sugar coating. Very good.

My first time making Irish Soda Bread. This recipe is super easy and I followed exactly as written.  I will definitely make again minus  one less cup of raisins and just brush the top with butter  instead of dusting with flour before baking. otherwise no other changes need to be made.  I baked in a 9" round cake pan for 70 minutes and it came out golden brown and very moist.

I gave this 5 stars in 2017.  I’d give it more if I could.  In 2018 I made it again and posted  a pic.  Here are a few details.  I mixed cottage cheese and a bit of sour cream (a quick buzz with the blender), used milk and a tablespoon of vinegar for buttermilk.  Only gave it about 10 stirs with my hands.  The batter is like thick cake batter.  Cut an X in the bread and poked a 1/2 in hole in the center before cooking.  It’s great!

Great recipe! I followed it exactly except I cut the raisins in half. I used a buttered pie placed to bake it and it popped right out to put on the rack to cool. Made a large beautiful loaf but I could've made 4 smaller loaves for gifts. Thank you for sharing!!

I'll start by saying I followed the directions almost precisely. This bread turns out wonderful! The only change was to used 1tsp caraway seeds instead of 1tbs. I never used caraway seeds before and was unsure of the flavor. The sent was quite strong so I reduced it to be safe. I am glad that I did because the flavor is very potent and I could still taste it with 1 teaspoon, although not too strong. I don't think I would like it with 1tbs. I love raisins, so I would not use less than 1.5 cups but 3 is A LOT.

I've never made Irish soda bread before and I was scared because I'm not a baker but this was absolutely outstanding. Rave reviews from my family and so easy to make. Will definitely make this again.

Dry and wet ingredients as written I just prefer to go heavier on the caraway.  I picked up jumbo light and  dark raisins from nuts.com, they have a nicer appeal to me.  Penguin lady this recipe is just ducky!!

Irish soda bread is not really my fave bread, but around St. Pat's Day, you have to make it, right?  I like this recipe better than others because it calls for sour cream which makes it more moist than most.  I leave out the caraway seeds because that's just not the flavor I'm looking for.  As far as being a sticky dough, yeah, it is, but so what...it's all about the final results. My husband toasts it and enjoys with butter!

This is the best Irish Soda Bread I've ever made! I was a little skeptical at first when the dough was so gooey. The end result was a magnificent  bread! I've made it three times already and shared it with my neighbors and friends. I stuck to the recipe except on the third time. I was a little short on buttermilk so added more sour cream to compensate. It didn't  turn out as good as the first two batches.  I only added 1 cup of golden raisins, which was the perfect amount. I give this recipe 5 stars! Thank you Penguin Lady!

I've never had any other Irish soda bread to compare it to, so for me it was really good. Definitely more cake-like than bread in my opinion, but hey, who doesn't love cake? Yes it is pretty sticky, but so worth the end result.

A few years ago, I was searching for a good Irish soda bread recipe,  and was giving up hope when I found this. It has become all the rage in my neighborhood, and when I make it, it is usually gone the next day. It's simple and easy to make, and a family favorite. You can also separate it into multiple loaves, which is helpful for sharing. I recommend having this with a big slab of butter and Irish Breakfast tea!

I make a different irish soda bread every year and never like it. This one, however was a hit! I left out the fennel because i didn't have any, made buttermilk by adding a tsp and a half of apple cider vinegar to the milk and it came out delicious! I will use only 2 cups of raisins next time, though. Some people's reviews were complaining about the consistency of the batter. Expect it to be very sticky, like cake or muffin batter. Saving this to be part of our St. Paddy's day tradition.

Absolutely wonderful! Some swaps I had to make as I didn't have all the ingredients, however, it was still top rate! Only used one cup of raisins, and I didn't have buttermilk so I used kefir and I cut the sugar down to 1/3 a cup. I would take it out at 60 minutes next time (I gave it an extra five minutes or so baking time) and I brushed the top with water instead of flour. Everyone loved this bread and I will absolutely make it again!

Skipped the caraway seeds,  and used apricots and cranberries instead of raisins. Doubled the recipe and got 3 nice 8 inch round loaves. Served with Dubliner cheddar. Awesome.

Fist time using this recipe. I believe it's my all-time favorite! I do like the flavor of caraway but if it's not your favorite you might want to use half. I used 2 1/2 cups of the raisins because I wanted to make two loves and I didn't buy enough. It was perfect to me. I used a cast iron pan and was afraid it was too brown but it is done in the center and soft with crusty outside. Before cooking it resembles a wet cookie dough so if you are used to baking traditional bread don't panic it works.

Delicious.  Easy.  It needed to bake for 80-85 minutes.  I used milk and vinegar because I didn't have buttermilk.  And I used 1 cup raisins and 1 cup craisins (total 2 cups, not 3) and that was plenty!

I substituted fennel seeds for the caraway and used 1 cup raisins, 1 cup dried cherries and 1 cup dried cranberries. So good! It was gone on a flash. I will definitely be making this again.

I used vanilla Almond Fresh almond milk instead of the milk and sour cream.  I did use the 1/2 cup of sugar but only 2 cups of dried cranberries rather than raisins.  No caraway.  The results were great.  I also used the whites only, of 3 eggs.  I will add more baking powder when I make it next time as it didn't rise as much as I had hoped.   This was my first shot at a soda bread.  A Great recipe to start from.

SO GOOD! The only thing I modified was to use one (or 1 1/2) cup of currants instead of raisins.  I will definitely make this one again.  Be sure to serve it with Irish butter!

I brushed with melted butter once during cooking, and fewer raisins because that's all i had on hand, otherwise no changes. Yes the dough is sticky, but it bakes up fine. This is delicious and definitely yummy for breakfast the day after!

I made this for a St Patrick's Day party and had never made it before so wasn't sure how it would come out or taste. Everyone at the party raved about it. It came out really delicious and j would make it again.

This is the best Irish Soda bread recipe!  I've tried so many over the years and this one beats them all.  It's so versatile too.  I've used cranberries and walnuts in it.  Just fantastic!

It's an excellent recipe, not too sweet, yet very tasty. I will bake it for a shorter time next time, as I found 60 minutes too long.

Turned out great even when I used yogurt instead of sour cream.  I love this bread.  I make it at least once a week and don't buy bread at the store anymore.

Today I added cheese and onion powder in place of the caraway and raisins.  I am having fun playing with this recipe.  I do cut down a little on the sugar.

MIne was way too wet to knead. I added a little more flour which might have been a mistake. I don't know. It was still wet with additional flour. I just went ahead and put it in the prepared pan and put it in the oven, It came out sooo good. I tried another recipe for Irish soda bread last year and it wasn't so great. I am glad I tried agan with this one. (I didn' have caraway seeds, so I just left them out. I don't even know what they taste like, so I don't know how much they wold change the bread.

While this is a wonderful tea bread,it is NOT a traditional Irish soda bread which doesn't have NEARLY this amount of sugar or dried fruit.  Go ahead and enjoy, but real soda bread is made with less than 2 Tablespoons sugar but does include wholemeal or whole wheat flour and buttermilk.  Just as easy to prepare and works well with the main course, unlike the sweet version here.

I've made this bread over and over again, it is a good solid recipe, however I omit the raisins and caraway seed, I also substitute some dark lager beer for some of the buttermilk,(1/2 cup buttermilk and 3/4 cup beer, or the other way around, depends on my mood) it gives it a nice wheat flavor and the aroma is wonderful

First time making this and will NOT be my last.  The only thing I changed was 1 1/2 cup raisins and 1 1/2 cup currants... Received fabulous compliments from co-workers and friends.  Thank you SO much for sharing this!

So delicious! It was an immediate hit with my family.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and my son says he'd like it more than just St. Patrick's Day.  I didn't have caraway seeds (though I personally like them) and used 1cup golden raisins and 1cup currents.  Next time, I'll divide it in half for 2 loaves as this recipe made one HUGE loaf--too much for 3 people.

Really nice bread.  Added a little honey, cut the raisins back to about 1C, just a few shakes of caraway and substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream.  Great texture and flavor.  Did take the full time to bake fully in the center, using a cast iron skillet.

I made this today and it was uh-mazing! I only used 1 box of raisins which came out to be about 2 1/4 cups. My four year old hated the raisin (what kind of a kid are you?!?!?!)...so next time I might omit the raisins so he will eat it (I'm sure it will still be good). It was super moist and the dough will be really sticky (like stick to your hands bad sticky). If this did not come out right for you, you def did something wrong!

I used one stick of butter  mixed in to dough in place of the sour cream .  I had used another recipe for years but this is more moist and slices well without falling apart .  Used only 2 cups of raisins. It was perfect.   Not to sweet.

This recipe was amazing. Yes the dough is wet however a little sprinkling of flour on your hands and on the dough solves the stickiness issue! Also I made some modifications to the recipe. I halved the sugar (1/4 cup), omitted the raisins, added a little more than 1 tbs of caraway seeds and baked in a dutch oven. This bread was perfection!

I just took this out of the oven and tried a piece it is AMAZING. Although I did not use sour cream I used a stick of butter and as I was needed all the ingredients it was very dry and I wasn't sure how it would turn out. But it cooked well and tastes just great. Definitely making this again :)

Bread recipes do not usually call for eggs, as adding eggs to bread makes them more cake-like and less bread-like.  With this recipe, adding eggs probably counteracts the amount of liquid that is being used, as opposed to the normal 1 3/4 cup buttermilk (or Yogurt).  Essentially, you could switch Yogurt for the buttermilk, especially if you wanted another flavor to the bread (after all, all it's looking for is cultured/soured milk).  Overall the bread recipe came out OK, but it was more cakey than Soda bread would be.

This bread is delicious! I made it for our St. Patrick's Day party and received many compliments and requests for the recipe. I followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the amount of raisins to two cups rather than three. I give it a rating of 5 stars!

I enjoyed it; it tasted very authentic and a good way to enjoy St Paddy's Day. However, for personal preference I too would have dropped the caraway seeds and added a bit more sugar for a sweeter bread.

For a healthier option, I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  My kids actually prefered it this way!  Delicious and easy recipe!

Very tasty ! LOTS of raisins - which was ok for us. Also don't be scared by the carraway seeds : the quantity is perfect to add a twist without any"pharmacical" bad taste.. The bread didn't raise like on the picture though :-( Maybe too old soda? But deserves an other try : was too good with butter or apricot jam...

Typically I let my Bread Machine Prepare my bread but I gave this recipe a shot and Loved It!.  Had a Dinner Party for 4 and Everyone Loved it and Took Some Home!..  Try it in the toaster the next day and it is equally good.

Not a good recipe. I'm wondering if it's because I used the cast iron skillet. The bread ended up being hard as rock, despite having followed the recipe

This was a winner on ST PATRICK'S day. 
I did not add the seeds, and kept the recipe as posted.
It was moist and all the kids loved it with the  generous raisins.

Great recipe.  I left out the caraway seeds (personal preference).  Bread was great the day I made it and great toasted the day after.  I will make this again and use whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little healthier.  Also, we didn't have sour cream so I used nonfat Greek yogurt with perfect results.

I know there a lot of reviews where people didn't like the caraway seeds, but I really wanted to try this because I do like them. Yes it is sticky during the process and it calls for way too many raisins, but I kept going using less raisins. It was gone in one meal. My family and guests asked for more.

I give this recipe a five star because it was so easy to make and the family really enjoyed it.  I made this exactly as written except I was almost a cup short of raisins.  It still turned out wonderful .   Next time I may add a variety of dried fruits along with the raisins.  This is my first experience with Irish soda bread and it is a keeper.

This was the first time I have ever made Irish Soda Bread... It was a HUGE Success!!!!  Super easy, super tasty!!!!  My 4 year old gave it a thumbs up and asked for another slice!!!!  The only change I made was 1 cup each: Regular Raisins, Golden Raisins & Craisins.  This will be my first and only Irish Soda Bread recipe!!!!

I left out the caraway seeds (personal preference).  I also had a little trouble with the top and sides getting REALLY brown before the middle was done, so I might cover them with foil for at least half of the baking time.  But everyone loved the recipe.

This was my first time making irish soda bread and I was absolutely pleased with the result. For the most part, I followed the recipe exactly, except instead of 1 tbsp of caraway seeds, I only used about 1/4 tsp. I used a cask iron skillet and baked for about 65 minutes. Beautiful result, nice moisture for a bread but not too cakey. I will definitely be making this again!

I picked this recipe because of the buttermilk and sour cream. I omitted the raisins and the caraway just because of my picky kids.  I baked it in an 8 inch cake pan.  I was going to split it and make 2 loaves, because it didn't look like enough dough at first.  It baked up into a huge loaf.  I might make 2 smaller loaves next time.   Also, I had trouble cutting the top because it was so sticky.  I sprayed Pam on the back of a spatula, and spread the dough in the pan and smoothed out the top a little.  I sprinkled the top with sugar.  It was just enough to make the top crust slightly sweet with a little crunch.  I was previously baking the Irrestible Irish Soda Bread from this site, which is more of a quick bread.  We liked this one better.  I'm keeping this recipe in my recipe box and deleting all the other ones.

This was a great launching point for the soda bread recipe of my dreams. The result was much more moist and tender than most soda breads I've tasted so that was a big plus. I think three cups of raisins was overdoing it, so I used two but it was still heavier on the raisins than I like. The full tablespoon of flour dusted on the top was also too excessive since it never really dissolved into the dough as much as pictured. I ended up with lots of raw flour on top.

Next time I think I will reduce the raisin content to a more typical one to one and a half cups, grease AND flour the pan for a crustier bottom, and either reduce or eliminate dusting the top with flour.

I made this recipe as written (minus the caraway seeds cuz my store was ALL OUT) and it was delicious!! Very quick and easy to make.  There was no reason to change anything. As stated it is a sticky dough so that never concerned me and once baked it looked beautiful and was scrumptious!!!

Excellent recipe! Perfect texture and sweetness. I only added a touch more than 2 cups of raisins and I think that was fine. I think 3 would be too much. I was a little worried because the dough looked so lumpy and had very little form to it but it was perfect.

Wonderful recipe. Recommendations: Use 3 full cups raisins, 65 minutes at 350 conv oven. Didn't have caraway seed. Suggest dusting with sugar instead of flour. Used a 9" cake pan - puffed up well.

Really great! used the dried buttermilk and water.  I forgot to add the water with the wet ingredients and had to remix it in after i had put it in the pan, but it STILL came out great!  I used a 9x5 loaf pan and the middle is a little underdone after 65 minutes.  Texture is definitely gooey like cookie dough.

Worst "irish soda bread" ever, porportions are all wrong, way too much liquids making the dough way too sticky. way too many raisins. Adding the caraway seeds is a mistake. I was skeptical of the seeds with the raisins but decided to try it anyway and it turned out grose.

This is the only Irish bread I have ever made or eaten. I skipped the raisons this time but I think I will try it with them next go around, other than that I followed the recipe. My wife and I think it turned out very good. We made Ruban Paninni with it the next night.

Five Stars plus hands down !  I had company coming over for St. Patricks day  so I wanted the whole traditional thing. I was worried being as I had never had soda bread before. This recipe was WONDERFUL (I did cut the raisin size in half and no caraway seeds)  .... the loaf was totally eaten at dinner and my husband who does not eat carbs ... well he has asked if I would make loaf #3 for him today. I made a loaf and took it to a club meeting and I was asked by a neighbor if he could bring the rest home ..... lets just say it was a HIT !!!!!!!!

Easy to make, and great to eat.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and added cinnamon and used only 1 cup of raisins.  Next time I'll use even more cinnamon and increase to 2 cups of raisins.

I made this to go along with my corned beef and cabbage, everybody just loved it!  I didn't have buttermilk so I soured my own milk with vinegar, other than that it was the only thing I did different.  The caraway seeds just made this bread delishes, and a sweet taste of raisin every once in a while was so good.  Everybody wanted the recipe.  I'll be making this again!

Baked this today with my sister--it was so so so so so awesome!!! I skipped the caraway seeds because I couldn't find any at the grocery store and put only a little bit of raisins. When kneading the dough, I thought that I could've forgotten an ingredient or something, it was so sticky. But it turned out great! Definitely will bake this again! :3

Children enjoyed this.  16 yo son thought plain bread could be more versatile.  Husband thought this had too many raisins, otherwise liked it.  The batter I made was too thin to 'knead' in any way at all, thus was also too thin to 'slash' effectively, but still nice.  Might make again, but want to try some other Irish breads for now, as I'm looking for something to go with leek and oatmeal soup....... Brotchan Roy, or Foltchep, they call it......, and this is too sweet for that......, fun, but too sweet for my soup......

Very easy to make and delicious.  I used fat free sour cream, skim milk with 1 tablespoon of vinegar instead of the buttermilk and didn't add the caraway seeds cuz I didn't have any.  The result was a very quick, low fat and yummy bread!  NExt time I might try using half whole wheat flour.  Thanks for the recipe!

Rave reviews from my family! he buttermilk an sour cream made all the difference - do not leave these out! Bread was moist and very tasty. I baked in a 9 inch round pan for 65 minutes and it came out absolutely perfect. I will definitely make this again.

This bread is so delicious it's beyond words. I have never made nor eaten such a fabulous loaf. It looked fantastic, smelled divine and tasted even better. Nice, crispy crust and the softest insides - I wanted to lay on it. Not the super dense bread I usually associate with Irish Soda Bread. I left out the raisins and caraway seeds and I have no idea how long I cooked it because the timer went off while I was in the shower and my husband didn't remember hearing it go off. My slits did not really do much - I even tried the old dip your knife in the flour trick, but that didn't help. Will take another reviewer's suggestion to slice it 15 minutes into cook time next time. And I only sprinkled a pinch of flour on top but will probably skip in the future - it just kinda sits there; doesn't really bake into it; you can just tap it off the slice. Otherwise, perfection! My guests ate it up - they couldn't stop. I was afraid there wouldn't be enough left over for French toast this morning - thanks to Nikki for this incredible idea (I use Alton Brown's French Toast recipe, in case you're interested). I can't wait to make this bread again. So good. So easy. So amazing. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this fantastic recipe, Penguin Lady. Bread bliss!

Great recipe! I usually. Have the problem of the bread coming out way too dry. With the sour cream and buttermilk my bread came out moist and delicious. The only recommendation. I would have is watch the cooking time. I made mine in a 10" cake pan and it only took 45 min to bake.

Great recipe!! The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did make modifications that others suggested... I put in about 1 1/4 cup raisins instead of 3 (1 cup reg raisins, 1/4 golden). Everything else I followed to the letter and it was delicious!! And for those who noted a "Wet" dough, please note that you should not be adding ALL of the wet mixture into the dry, as the recipe states you should only add enough to create a "sticky" dough. Will totally be making this again! Thank you for sharing it :)

When I put this in the oven this afternoon, I was convinced I'd be giving this a low rating. Like other reviewers, I had a really difficult time with the instruction to knead the dough in the bowl. The dough was almost like a batter and very difficult to knead. I basically couldn't, it was just all over my hands, but I put it in the cast iron skillet anyways figuring I'd see what happened. It baked perfectly in 65 minutes. It was beautiful in appearance and delicious in taste. The only change I made was to use less raisins and eliminate the caraway seeds. I will definitely make this again, but I will knead it with the dough hook of my kitchen aid for 30-45 seconds as another reviewer suggested instead of attempting to do it with my hands.

It was  phenominal!  everyone thought it was a cross between delicious bread and cake.  I will pass this recipe around for all my family to enjoy.  I used lemon juice to clot the milk because i had no buttermilk on hand.   It still came out wonderfull!  thank you Penguin Lady for a great and delicious treat!!

Love this bread but next time, definitely 2 cups of raisins, 3 is too much. I didn't have sour cream so used 2 cups of buttermilk and 1/4 cup of some vanilla greek yogurt I had in the back of the fridge, it came out perfect. The flour on top was not necessary and it was sort of hard to make the slit in the dough, I tried and then cut another one in while it was in the oven. Definitely a do over.

I am not a baker, but  love to cook.  The last time I made irish soda bread years ago it was dry and fell apart.
Just made  this recipe today for St Patrick's Day 3/17/12.  It is so delicious and moist.  My husband and son love it.  Would just leave out the dusting of flour at the end.  Too messy.   Also I originally thought there were too many raisins, but the measurement was perfect.
I guess baking is back in my future.

This is so good!  I didn't have caraway seeds so I substituted fennel, and I didn't have fresh buttermilk so I substituted powdered, and since many reviewers suggested using less raisins I used only two cups.  My kitchen smells heavenly, and I couldn't resist cutting into the loaf while it was still warm.  Delicious, easy and I will definitely make this again and again!  Lovely on a rainy day like today, and I plan to serve it with corned beef and cabbage for dinner tonight.  Thank you Penguin Lady for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This recipe produced good bread, and it was pretty easy to make.  I added about 1 cup of raisins.  I should've added 2 cups of raisins!  I had to add an additional 1/2 cup of buttermilk to make a dough (it was just crumble before that), though I'm not sure why.

I baked in loaf pans rather than round cake pans. I incorporated all the flour into the mix instead of  dusting the tops of the unbaked loaves.  I tripled the recipe with a yield of 4 nice size loaves of bread. The recipe was a hit with family & friends.

Very yummy! I baked it for about 55-60 mins, and it came out perfect! Even my husband (who hates soda bread) loved it! When I told him it was homemade Irish Soda Bread he was shocked! I'm so glad to have a recipe for this bread so I can make it all year long!

I looked at all the other Irish Soda Bread recipes here and decided on this one. I made 3 loaves over the week and all 3 came out perfect. Very simple, very tasty and what I would call a very traditional Irish Soda Bread. I, like another reviewer, used my kitchenaide mixer with the dough hook, on low, and continually scraped the bowl. I also basted the bread with a mixture of buttermilke and melted butter throughout the baking process.

The question of flour on top is corrected by adding some confectioners sugar dusted on top through a fine sieve.  This is the way we always had it in NY..My grandmother's recipe had caraway seeds, no sour cream.  Since I don't likie caraway seeds, I always omit...but try the powdered confectioners sugar on top - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. The sour cream made a nice moist bread

Very good recipe. Not too cake like which I liked. I used it for sandwiches and also ate some just with butter. Yummy.

This was by far the best I ever made myself and best I ever tasted.  It's beautiful to look at to boot.  It's moist inside and crusty outside, just perfect.  Mine cooked the entire 75 minutes.  I will definately make it again!

Changes:  I left out the carraway seeds and I used about two cups of mixed raisins since that is how much came in the bag.  The dough was very gooey and difficult to knead so I just stirred it.  I forgot to carve the "X" in the top.  The bread baked in about 50 minutes.  It was VERY GOOD!  I was afraid it would be crumbly but the crust was nice and crisp and the bread was sturdy.  It was not too sweet but makes a good dessert.  I'd like to try it as French toast.

I always make the recipe exactly as written for a first try and then modify as I go along. Well I have to tell you this one is amazing. I didn't think it was going to come out well as the dough was almost a batter. But I saw other people wrote that they had a similar experience. I did have my oven turned up a little high (I'm experiementing with accuracy) so it was a little over done on the edges. I ran out of regular granulated sugar so I used my stash of vanilla flavored sugar. All in all it was amazing.

A hit!!  It was a little more moist than traditional Irish bread, but totally tastey - everyone asked for seconds.  Serves WAY more than the recipe indicates.

This is the first time I have made Irish Soda Bread. It was a hit with my Corned Beef boiled dinner. My 18 year old son, who works at Panera Bread, said I should go be a baker there since it was so good.

Well, this was great. I nearly didn't pay the megabucks needed for caraway, but I gave in; then I nearly didn't go back to the store for forgotten sour cream, but I did. I used half white whole wheat flour, skimped a bit on the sugar, and for the 3 c. raisins I used a mixture of raisins, currants, and some citron. Easy and delicious.

Absolutely the best ever...simple, and better than Mom used to make.  For St. Patrick's Day I have to make at least 2 loaves, and make it throughout the year as a breakfast bread.

I just pulled a loaf of this bread out of the oven and had a slice while it was still hot, and the flavor is really delicious, but I'm giving it four stars because it jsut isn't what I expect from a soda bread. My mother used ot make itevery year and I remember it being dense, dry, crumbly, and heavy (aparently the qualities that other people DON'T like, but I happen to love.) This bread is more like a traditional quickbread or a cake than a soda bread. Crtainly a reliable recipe,a nd very very good for what it is... but jsut not my idea of soda bread. Will probably try something else next time.

This was just okay for me.  My husband brought home a slice of Irish soda bread from someone at work and it was so delicious I had to try to make it myself.  This recipe wasn't anything like the one I tried.  Very dry, which maybe is how 'real' soda bread is supposed to be.  I don't know, I had never had it before and this was my first attempt at making it.  It looks beautiful...but most of it's still sitting on my kitchen counter.  Won't be making this recipe again, sorry.

I just ate this with potato-leek soup, and it was lovely!  I bypassed the caraway seeds and raisins completely.  The bread was a little too sweet for my taste, so I'll cut down on sugar, but overall incredibly moist and flavorful.  It smelled wonderful while baking, and came out golden at 65 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I needed a recipe for tomorrow evenings St. Paddy's Day party...just pulled the first two loaves out of the oven.  Rave reviews from my family !!  Changed it up a little - after reading the reviews, only added 2 cups of raisins (1 cup golden & 1 cup regular seedless raisins ).  I divided the soft dough into two and put them in loaf/bread pans.  I sprinkled the caraway seeds ( maybe 1/4 teaspoon/pan ) on top of the dough and then did the same with a little flour. They were in the oven for 45 minutes and turned out fabulous... a real yummy recipe...thanks...

Wonderful tasting bread. Would have rated it w/ 5 stars but for a couple of things...1) 3 cups of raisins is a bit much. 2 and a half tops is fine. 2) Dough was way too sticky to cut a slit in it. 3) Maybe it's my oven but from reading other reviews I don't think so...needs to be covered with foil for sometime or it gets overly brown on top.

This was Ok, not quite my mom's. I only used 2 c. raisins, and the raisin flavor seemed a touch strong. I didn't have buttermilk so I soured 1% with lemon juice, so my batter was really wet, I should have added more flour. I also used low fat sour cream. I may try it again with fewer raisins and non-low fat ingredients next time. I don't blame the recipe for my not really liking it, I blame myself for trying to make things low fat, that should teach me :-P

The taste was very good, but the dough was too moist to ever knead, even after adding 1/2 cup more flour than called for.  I just stuck it in the pan and hoped for the best.  The top became dark brown in 45 minutes, but the inside remained doughy.  I think I will try a different recipe next time, but there weren't any complaints from my hungry family.

This was a very easy recipe, but I think it would have tastier if I had followed the way it was written instead of other reviewer's suggestions.  I only put 2 tsp of caraway seeds and 2 cups of raisins.  It turned out good, but not as good as my grandmother's.  My grandmother's is packed with raisins and you can taste the caraway in every bite.  When I make this again, I'll use all 3 cups of raisins and 1-1 1/2 tbs of caraway seeds.

This bread was a big hit.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and used one cup of raisins and one cup of sweetened dried cranberries.  I also omitted the caraway seeds and used half whole wheat flour for a little more fibre.  It was still really moist yet dense.  Great for breakfast!  Thanks for sharing.

Everyone loved this recipe and even requested copies for themselves.  I omitted the raisins and seeds in one loaf so my kids would eat it and everyone loved it that way also!!

Terrific! Won raves at the luncheons I served it at for St. Paddy's Day! I did reduce the raisins to only one cup and the caraway seed to about one and one-half tsps but the taste is great! I will make this again and again!

Delicious. I make several Irish Soda Bread Recipes and this is the best. The sour cream makes it moist and gives it a whole different texture. I agree with the other rater who suggested caraway seeds and raisins be added to your own taste. I used 2 cups of raisins but will use the 3 next time. I used a combination of golden and dark raisins which looked nice and tasted good. I only used 1 tsp. of the caraway seed. For us that was perfect. This is an easy recipe for a beginner and is fast to make.
