I served this for a luncheon and my friends are still nagging me for the recipe. Instead of store-bought strawberry glaze, I made my own, using 1 cup of strawberries, mashed, 1 cup of water, 11/2 tsp. cornstarch, and about 3/4 cup sugar.  Brought to a boil then pushed through a sieve. Then, cool. I then followed EINNA68's directions for serving, except I drizzled some chocolate sauce on top.  To make the sauce, just melt some chocolate chips in the microwave, then stir in whipping cream to the desired consistency. I like to decorate the dessert plate with this--put it into a squirt bottle and squirt your design onto the plate. Don't forget to save a few whole, perfect strawberries to use as garnishes.  And get ready for those friends to start nagging!

This recipe is top notch, however, I did add 3/4 cup of sugar to the crust recipe.  It makes the crust taste like shortbread cookies and is a great improvement.  I have tried it both ways.  Other than that this recipe is excellent.

This is a great recipe.  I've always made it with a graham cracker crust (no baking!)  And I layer the cream cheese layer, strawberries and top with more whipped cream.  DELICIOUS!

Excellent recipe!  I did make a few alterations, however.  I used a graham cracker crust, 1 cup of confectioners sugar, and an 8 ounce container of whipped topping.  Also, I made my own strawberry glaze by heating 1 cup of cut up strawberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup water mixed with cornstarch.  Then I removed the pan from heat, and I added a tbspn butter and 2 tsps lemon juice.

We really liked this recipe except for the crust.  It had way to much butter and when it was cooled it was imposible to get out of the pan.

A very good recipe, very tasty.  I think the secret to the crust is not allowing it to brown, I only baked it for 9 minutes and it came out perfect.

This is pretty good, but I feel like it's missing something--Maybe next time I'll try addding lemon juice to the filling.  I'd also like to cut down on the powdered sugar next time as it seems to take away from the cream cheese flavor and as a little too sweet for my taste.

Very delicious recipe.  I made the crust the night before to help speed up the dessert the next day.  Many asked for recipe.  Enjoy.

This was an amazing dessert. It was something everyone enjoyed, and I especially like it because my sister is a vegan, and this recipe doesn't include any eggs! It's light and yummy!

We ultimately loved this, but I did make some changes.  This being a dessert with many variations, one that has been around a loooong time, I knew there was too much butter for the relatively small amount of  flour.  This may be why some reviewers experienced a "hard" crust.  Upping the flour to 2-1/4 cups took care of that problem.   I also knew that no sugar would make for a pretty tasteless crust.  Adding 1/2 cup of powdered sugar remedied that too.  As for the filling, fresh whipped cream is so much better than Cool Whip if you don't mind the extra effort - I used one pint (2 cups or 16 ozs.) Although other reviewers remarked the filling was too sweet, I didn't have that issue since the fresh whipped cream , of course, is not sweetened while Cool Whip, of course, is.  I did use a commercially prepared glaze, however,  I brightened up the flavor with a little pure strawberry extract.  A homemade glaze would  have been even better, but I was pretty pleased with it as is.   Bottom line, Hubs and I thought this pretty summer dessert was lick the plate good.

This turned out very very well. Altho I think I am making a few changes the next time I make this. I was very unhappy with the crust. Had no flavor and after sitting in the fridge for 8 hours, became hard as a rock. Could not cut into it at all. A chocolate chip cookie crust with this is much better. The cream cheese part was so delicious and easy to make. Altho it was way too sweet. Less powdered sugar would be better.

This is simply awesome.  I've given out the recipe at least 10 times.  The only thing I changed was using refrigerated sugar cookie dough becasue I was in a hurry the first time I made it.  I'm sure the crust in the recipe is fantastic, but the sugar cookie dough was good, so I'll continue taking this short cut.  Thanks, I'm making it again tomorrow!!

This dessert was so easy to make. The filling is light and the strawberries add so much to the flavor. I used my homemade jam instead of the glaze and it turned out perfect. YUMMY!

I agree with other reviewers after making this as written.  Crust was flavorless and dry.  Use a graham cracker crust.  I also reduced the powdered sugar to 1 1/2 cups, otherwise it would have been too sweet.

I have made this pie for the last several years to get reviews. I do not use but 1 cup of powdered sugar and an 8 oz container of cool whip. I always fold the cut strawberries into the cream mixture. You do not need to refrigerate before your enjoy. If there is any left over it will keep for only a few days in the refrigerator.

I like the quickness of this dessert & the idea of chopped pecans in the crust, but crust was flavorless, and the cake part was way too sweet,   I went ahead and made fresh strawberry glaze which was the perfect amount of sweetness instead of ready to use which I thought would have been too sweet.  Next time I will add sugar to the crust like other mention and I will only use 1/2 to 1/2 cup confectioners sugar.

I made this to take to a family gathering and everyone absolutely loved it! I followed Puma's suggestion for the strawberry topping and it was divine. A few suggested using blueberries or pineapple for a topping also. All around delicious! Thanks!

Really nice summertime dessert. I did take some other reviewers advice and made a few changes. I added 1/2 cup sugar to the crust which was perfect. I'm also not a fan of the prepared strawberry topping so I made my own like a strawberry pie with 1 cup water, 1 cup sugar, 4 T. cornstarch - cooked until clear, then added 4 T. strawberry jello. It was very pretty and nice that most of it can be made the day before. I will definitely make again!

Way too much sugar in the cream cheese layer, holy cow it was really sweet.  I didn't like the taste of the strawberry glaze I bought so I left it off and just had the berries on the top.  Really tasty though.

This recipe was delicious! The only thing that I did different was that after I baked the crust, I boiled water in a teapot and added some sugar to it. With that I took a little brush and spread it over the crust. That way the crust wasn't bitter at all. Other than that it was delicious.

this recipe is quick and easy to make. I added 4 tablespoons of Disaronno italian liqueur to the cream cheese, sugar, and whip cream mixture. It added a little bit of a kick to the taste. Instead of adding stawberry syrup on top I melted Ghiaradelli 60% cacao bitter sweet chocolate as a sweet topping. For chocolate lovers it was a great variation.

Super!  Didn't change a thing!  Everyone raved about it.  I couldn't find glaze in a jar so used a packet of Oetker red glaze and it worked fine.

Because I was harried in getting ready to have company I didn't read carefully and missed the part that said to let it set for 8 hours or overnight.  Thankfully this is a wonderful recipe and I put my fridge on the coldest setting and it turned out perfectly.  I cut down the amount of icing sugar to one cup as the other reviewers suggested.  I made a topping of blackberries, blueberries, strawberries and raspberries by mixing 2 cups of them with a cup of sugar and stirring the mixture until it became liquid and simmered and thickened.  I melted chocolate chips in the microwave, then cut the edge off a ziploc bag and piped chocolate hearts onto a silipat pad that I placed on a cookie sheet in the freezer.  I served the cake with the glaze, whole berries and chocolate garnish.  It was amazing!

If you like sweet things this recipe is for you. The crust needs a bit of help to hold together better. Graham cracker crust works best here. Cut down on the powdered sugar. Just not necessary in order to let the cream cheese flavor shine.

This was absolutely delicious! And very easy to make. I did make a graham crust that I baked for 10 minutes first. Instead of buying glaze I made my own from 5T strawberry jello, 1 1/2c water and 4 T cornstarch..combine and bring to a boil stirring constantly. Remove from heat and spread on the strawberries when it is cool.

Really loved it, but the second time around i made it with a biscuit bake like for a cheesecake it was heaps better and i didn't have to have it in the oven, so it didn't take to long to make and have on the table for dessert that evening.

Make it easy on yourself and make a quick graham cracker crust...buttery goodness! I agree with the reviewers about layering and NO store bought strawberry jam if you have time to make it yourself.  My boyfriend kept the whole pan in the fridge and guarded it well.  Thanks for the tasty dessert recipe!

The crust was really good.  The cream cheese layer was really sweet and a bit heavy.  If I make this again, I will omit the strawberry glaze.

I made this for my couples' bridge club and they all loved it. Not a crumb left. I did add blueberries to the top as I was having a red, white, and blue theme. Easy and delicious.

Took the advice of one other reviewer and added more flour to the crust.  It made it more dense than I wanted but overall it was very good. I received many compliments so I would surely make it again.  Very, very good.

This was nice and my husband certainly devoured it, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the nuts in the crust. If I make this again I would omit the nuts and make the crust more cookie like by adding some sugar. Good way to use up strawberries (though I only had about 2/3 the amount listed and that seemed plenty) so will make again the next time I have some that need to be used.

I followed the recipe exactly with the few changes I read about.  I added 3/4 cup of white sugar to the crust recipe and lowered the powdered sugar to 1 1/2 cups to the filling.  There was not one slice left!!  This was easy and delicious!!

This was certainly a big hit at our dinner part last night. I used the suggestion to add 3/4 C of sugar to the crust and glad I did. I made my own glaze with recipe taken from Stawberry Pie I. Then mixed strawberries and glaze together before chilling. I think it tastes even better the next day. It certainly is NOT Weight Watcher friendly, but just have small portions -- it's worth it!

Just made this fantastic treat! Everyone (especially the kiddo's) LOVED it. I used shortbread cookies and made the muffin cups. Will be adding this to our church cookbook I am working on and to my Favorites also. What a great summertime treat to have on hand for guests. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is quite tasty, but a little messy.  I cooked the crust for 9 minutes as others suggested but mine still did not hold together properly; it certainly did not look like the picture.  Even so, it got enthusiastic reviews from my husband and friends, and I will definitely try it again (with home-made glaze next time).
