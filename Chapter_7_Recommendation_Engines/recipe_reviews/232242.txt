Delicious! I added some chopped garlic and omitted the broth (didn't have any) so used a little extra milk to compensate. Like others said, I steamed the cauliflower, so didn't think I needed to pat it dry or use paper towels. It's a great side dish!

My son & husband reaaly liked this recipe. In fact my son (25 yrs old) thought they were potatoes...lol.  It was pretty easy to make and satisfying. The only drawback is it only
 yields 2 cups, which means no second helpings or 
leftovers :/ Note: I skipped the milk, it seemed fine w/o it. 
Thanks for the recipe, Deb! It is a keeper for sure :)

Wonderful recipe, everything came together. Did add a bit more milk because when I started to mix it started flying out of the bowl. Soup base essential to flavorings.

I don't usually gush but I'm gonna now.  This was to die for!  I substituted 1.5 tsp of salt for the chicken base but I think it was a tad much and next time I'll do one tsp.  Also used one large and one small garlic clcove instead of the roasted garlic.  It was way garlicky but uber delicious!  I steamed the cauliflower in a fry pan with about a 1/4 inch of water on the bottom, bringing the florets to a boil and covering, simmering for around 10+ minutes.     While that was cooking I combined the other ingredients in my Kitchen Aid bowl.  The flavor of this was amazing!  SO rich, creamy and flavorful  YUM!!!  Made a good amount... 3 of us ate and there are just a little bit of leftovers.

I hate cauliflower, but I needed to find some lower carb dishes for my diabetic husband. This was actually very good. I didn't take time to roast garlic and think the stuff in a jar is bitter, so I just used some garlic salt instead. I also steamed my cauliflower. It turned out fluffy and creamy at the same time. I didn't think I would ever like cauliflower. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is very good! I was pleasently surprised. Of course I would rather have mashed potatoes, but this is a great substitute. My teens even liked it. I would absolutely recommend this recipe!

This was my first attempt at making this recipe. I thought it was good but not as creamy as i was expecting. I would like to try this with cheese and bacon bits and take the garlic out.

This is great!!! Simple and tasty, didn’t feel like I was eating cauliflower. Only thing I did differently was to add fresh garlic rather than roasted ( for time )

I didn’t have any cream cheese so I substituted that with two wedges of Laughing Cow Creamy Swiss Original (& I doubled the cauliflower to hopefully have leftovers!). Deeeelish!! My low-carb eating hubby said “Wow!!”

I actually prefer this recipe to regular mashed potatoes, and it doesn't make me fat!  No changes here, just threw in some fresh parsley and garlic powder.   The next time I make this recipe I will double it.  Thank you for this simple and very tasty addition to my weight maintenance arsenal !

Delish! Although I did make a few changes. I kind of eye-balled everything, but I did make a mistake in that I added 1/4 cup cream cheese (instead of the one tablespoon the recipe asks for). I wasn't too worried about it, and luckily, it turned out amazing with more of the cream cheese ( I just completely omitted the milk). I'm not personally worried about fat content because this is meant as a low-carb option for me. Also, after boiling the florets, I threw them all into my VitaMix and got them all nice and creamy that way. I then squished them through a mesh bag to remove the excess water.  I find doing them this way creates more of a creamy mash, than chunky. I also doubled the amount of roasted garlic (basically two full heads). Thanks for sharing!

This delicious recipe is a great replacement for mashed potatoes.  It's a great low carb alternative too!  My family loves this and actually requests it instead of potatoes.  We usually serve it with roasted chicken and gravy. I made this without the soup base and found I didn't need the milk.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I typically HATE cauliflower but will definitely be making this again. The only things I changed were that I didn't add the milk, boiling it retained enough liquid, and I also didn't add the chicken base (couldn't find any) or roasted garlic. Instead I added roasted garlic base and it was amazing!

Only made a portion size & winged the measurements. I also steamed the cauliflower which saved a lot of time & mess. No need to drain in separate colander & dry with towels. I just let it drain. Did not have time to roast garlic used powder, eliminated milk and chicken base. Lastly, I used a food processor leaving a few small chunks. Delicious................ Debbie H

I had to cook my cauliflower a lot longer than 10' and I still wasnt able to get it to mash so I put it in a skillet and cooked till it was browned  Not very good but I am sure this is Cook error.
