Such a simple recipe, but as written, this is 3 stars. It turned out a little bland (bc of mostly using water as a base) and it had way too much pepper in it for the four of us who tasted it - and I only used half the amount stated in the recipe!  I highly recommend you start out with 1/2 tsp of pepper and go from there.  To help with the blandness, I ended up adding in about 2 tsp of chicken base (Better than Bouillon) which helped tremendously. I also added in more milk.  I can't say I could even taste the hot sauce, but I didn't bother adding more.  I love that this is low fat and low calorie. I will definitely make it again, but with my changes. Thank you Original Lee for the recipe!

Super easy to make, but I think when I make it again, (which I definitely will) I will use MUCH less pepper, like maybe only 1/2 tsp to start.....   all I could taste was the pepper!!! Overpowered the other flavors...   My hubby thought it was too spicy too..... Can't wait to try it again!

I skipped the hot sauce and milk but added 3 tbl of unsalted butter. Delicious and toddler friendly! I love my immersion blender! You could get the same effect with a regular blender but I tried the soup before and after blending and it was much better after.
