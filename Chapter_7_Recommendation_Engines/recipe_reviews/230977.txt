This was a very quick and easy recipe to put together which was a plus on a busy week night.  My family did not care for the texture of the sauce though because cooking the sour cream in the sauce caused the sour cream to "break".    We much prefer the "salsa chicken" on this site.  I prepare it the same way as this recipe to completely coat the chicken in the taco seasoning.   We just dollop some sour cream on top of the salsa chicken when it has cooked.  You get the same flavor profile as this chicken without having the dairy separate in the sauce.

This is one of my most favorite ways to make chicken. I use a homemade taco seasoning mix and serve this with spanish rice and homemade refried beans. This also excellent filling for tortillas. When I make this, I ALWAYS double it.

the chicken was moist but that is the only thing going for it. To begin with it needed at least another ten to fifteen minutes. The cheese didn't combine with it well. The salsa and sour cream didn't mix well and it just didn't work well. I made exactly as stated and I don't think I will even try to make it any better, just try another recipe

It is so easy to make and so good.  I used salsa verde and felt it was better than the regular salsa.

I've made this a few times. I've also found that if I forgot the taco seasoning, I didn't taste a difference so I often skip this step unless I happen to have some home made salt free seasoning on hand.

This recipe has become a staple in my house, I don't even follow the recipe, but make from memory because it is that easy and forgiving, and I often make my own taco seasoning. Both my 5 yr old and 2 year old sons eat this right up. I pair it with homemade Spanish Rice mixed with some vegetables and dinner is made easy.

I like this recipe, but first I bake the seasoned chicken breast 10 mins on each side, then top with the salsa and sour cream mixture and top it off with cheese and put it back in the oven for 15 minutes.

My family loved this. Like others, I made my own taco seasoning. Served it with Spanish  rice and it was a hit. I did have to cook it 10 minutes longer than stated but my chicken was still slightly frozen. Great recipe.

We really enjoyed this. It was quick and easy. It did take a little longer to cook - about 45 min.

My husband made this recipe tonight, and it was wonderful! He's not an experienced cook, but the recipe was very straightforward and simple, and it turned out great. He substituted plain non-fat greek yogurt for the sour cream, which was just as good, and used black bean and corn salsa. I am going to make this many, many times!
