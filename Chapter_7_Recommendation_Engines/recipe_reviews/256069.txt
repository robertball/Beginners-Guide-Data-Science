i am the submitter of this recipe. i noticed that AR made up their own part of the directions. DO NOT STORE IT OVERNIGHT IN THE FRIDGE. As one reviewer did, she did not get the proper consistency. After you've boiled it for a minute, turn the heat off, and put the lid on and leave it just like that, overnight. In the morning, stir it up til well blended, transfer to a container to then store in your fridge.   In the morning you will notice that the pumpkin has settled on top of the oats. Stir to combine.  At this point you can reheat slowly with a splash of milk, over low heat stirring constantly, til heated through, or microwave for 1 min, 30 sec. in individual servings. Thank you.

1-10-2017 I must admit these oats were a happy surprise. I haven't had much luck with "overnight" steel-cut oats. They never seem tender enough. These tasted great! Not crunchy, but just enough chewy texture for me. I took the submitter's suggestion in the intro and added sweetener, cream, and toasted walnuts. Delicious! These oats are a little thinner than my usual, but perfectly acceptable. (Weeble, the submitter, told me that she makes these oats the night before, covers them, and lets them sit on the stove all night. This allows them to thicken much better. Putting them in the frig cools them off too quickly and makes them thinner. I think next time I will definitely let them come to room temp before putting them in the frig for the night.)

I loved it, I did what the maker of this recipe did and left it in the pan overnight, and then heated it up on low.  It came out delicious with milk, honey, and a little bit of cinnamon.  I used pumpkin pie filling for the pumpkin purée, and it still turned out delicious.

I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin spice to begin with, but I made it for my son who is a pumpkin and oatmeal fanatic. He ate it, but it wasn't his fav.

Finally! I’ve been looking for a recipe that can be heated up a little bit each day and this is it!  Made as original recipe states and left out all day while at work. Thanks so much for the quick and healthy breakfast!

These turned out beautifully left sitting on the stove overnight as the submitter suggested.  They were just very bland for me.  I may try them again adding vanilla and brown sugar.  I served with syrup, but it only helped a little and I didn't wan to dump too much syrup on there.
