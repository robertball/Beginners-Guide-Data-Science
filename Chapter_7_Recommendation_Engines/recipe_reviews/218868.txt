A great dessert for guests & upcoming holidays!  Subs made:  1/2 C whipping cream for coffee (not a coffee drinker), also states serves 8, however called for 6 ramekins but didn't include size needed.  Since I only have four 7 oz ramekins I used my cupcake pan as well as an 8 x 8 cake pan!  My husband & I both agree the best size for us were the ones made in the cupcake pan.  I'll make these using the cupcake pan to send to my hubby's holiday feed at work!
