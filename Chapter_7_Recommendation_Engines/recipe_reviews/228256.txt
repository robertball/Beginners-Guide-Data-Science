Thank you for a delicious recipe! We really enjoyed this. I added salt and pepper to the marinade and used the lime juice to deglaze the pan before adding the onions and peppers. Definitely use pork tenderloin as suggested in this recipe. It is so tender and delicious. A cheaper cut won't do this recipe justice. Cooking time for the pork will vary depending on how thin you slice it. Mine only took about 2-3 each side.

I bought the pork pre-cut and had the onions also cut in a container in my fridge, so it turned out to be a very quick and easy evening meal. No left-overs.

A little bland for our palate, but okay.  We added soy sauce and it helped.  Will not use this recipe again.

This was bland and there was no sauce to speak of.  Was excited to try but definitely didn't work for us.

My family really enjoyed this dish. I didn't have time to marinate overnight, so it went in for 30 mins. also my family doesn't like cilantro so I changed it to parsley, but it was still delicious !

I bought a pre seasoned pork shoulder stir fry and it ended up pretty bland.  This recipe with a little help from corn starch saved my dinner.  This was soooo good.. Thank you

I have made this twice now and everyone loves it. It is a lot of prep but well worth it. I cut the meat the night before and let it marinade over night. After making it the 1st time I doubled the recipe so that there was some leftovers for lunch the next day.
