I have been looking for this recipe since forever! My exboyfriend in highschool had family who made this every year around holidays. I loooooooved it and now I have the recipe! Yay! this stuff is so good! But just to be fair, I have not offically tried this recipe, but it sounds like exactly what they did! yum!!! I cant wait to try it! Oh, and by the way, it it so worth all the work. I saw all of the family do it every year!

I did not ebjoy it. The scent was overpowered by the cheese and could not taste anything but the cheese. I highly do not recommend trying it.
