this was very yummy! i wrapped the fish in a paper towel for about 30 minutes or so first to remove excess liquid. i used much less mayo mixture than the recipe called for...about 1/2 cup for 1.25 lbs fish. it turned out great, not soggy at all. next time i will use fresh chopped spinach though, easier to deal with and tastes better.

This was awesome with a few changes.   I used one sheet of dough for the bottom and one for the top.  I put the bottom dough on the oven proof dish I was using.  I had a large piece of salmon, so I took the skin off and used that it was almost the size of the dough, but not quite.  I followed the directions, but used fresh spinach which I tossed in a tablespoon of olive oil first.  I covered with the second sheet of dough and pinched all the edges together.  I coated with the egg white and topped with a teaspoon of chopped shallots.   My company raved about it and insisted on the recipe.

Oh My Goodness!!!  This recipe was WONDERFUL!  My whole family and I loved it.  The only thing I did not have where the correct spices, so I used thyme and basil.  It was still wonderful.  I will be going to get the dill on my grocery list.  I had 4 4oz salmon so I cut the 2 dough rolls in half for each piece.  We enjoyed it so much.  I took leftovers for lunch the next day.  I would recommend a toaster oven and not a microwave to reheat.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe we will be eating it again soon.

Turned out better than I expected. Easy to make. I would use a lot less dijon or maybe no mustard at all.

Yum.  I used dried herbs only, regular salt and forgot to add mustard.  Plus a little extra spinach and it was very easy and came out deliciously

Very good! My partner always talks about his mother's salmon wellington, so I attempted this recipe for his birthday. His brothers and he loved it! The dijon and dill combination is delicious!

We made this with about 1 lb salmon fillet and it fit into the rolled-out puff pastry just fine. Even with cutting the amount of mustard/mayo sauce in half, there was still about 1/4 C. left over.

No dijon, no one likes.  I made Mini-wellingtons.  It was ALOT of work, but well worth it.  17 yr old LOVED them!

Delicious! And simple to make! I used very spicy Coleman's mustard, and much less of it, and loved the teeny bit of the kick. Definitely need about half the mustard/mayonnaise mixture, though. Was thinking about doing this with phyllo to make it a little healthier next time.

A lot of modifications need to be done, but this is a really good base for a recipe.
Mayo sauce make easily twice as much as you need.  I 'two-thirded' the mayo and mustard and kept the spices the same (so 1c mayo, 1/3c mustard).  Would have used left overs for dipping, except to mustardy.  
Mustard can be cut way back. I love Dijon, but still found it overpowering.  Next time I think I'll try a tbs to my 1 c mayo.

Fantastic! this recipe is helping my man fall in love... ;) I have been cooking on Sundays for my sweetheart and this one made #1. I chopped up some mushrooms to add to the sauce. The pastry cooked up just right. Served it w/ some green beans tossed in EVOO and garlic. Excellent.

I made this New Year's Eve for 22. There were no leftovers. It was amazing.  I do agree that you can cut the mayo in half,  but, another alternative is to serve it on the side as a dipping sauce.  We thinned it with some half and half.
YUMMY!!!  I will make it again and again.

I am only giving this recipe 3 stars, because I think that the oregano, thyme, basil and dill weed was a bit too much. I had a wonderful Sock-eye salmon filet, and the flavor of the salmon was overpowered a bit. My daughter said all she could taste was the mustard, even though I had cut back on it. I still think it's a good recipe, and I might not attempted it, had it not seemed, and was, so easy. I am looking forward to trying it again, but will have to tweak it some more to suit our tastes. ( I didn't have mayo, so used Miracle Whip, and that didn't seem to matter, but will get real mayo for next time.)We still ate half of it, and will enjoy the other half tomorrow. I cut the filet in half and wrapped each half in the puff pastry. I love that stuff.... never used it before!!

Awesome!  I put too much sauce on each wellington but it was still great!  This is way better than beef wellington.

My family loved it! It was so pretty too. I used blue cheese instead of feta, only because I didn't have any. Also, instead of frozen spinach, I sauteed fresh spinach in olive oil and garlic, and squeezed out the excess liquid. The salmon turned out moist and delicious. I served the salmon with a side of arugula and cranberry salad.

I've made this twice, once with all the salmon in one large wrapping, and once each wrapped individually. It is requested WEEKLY, by  my boyfriend and by my "almost vegetarian" daughter both. I did reduce the dijon mustard down to 1/3 cup however, to mellow the flavor just a little. It's amazing!

So yummy. After reading reviews I used fresh spinach. I also used cream cheese instead of feta and mixed it with shallots and mushrooms sautéed together. And I reduced the amount of mayo mixture making about half and agree the recipe would have made far too much.

I have made this recipe twice in one week. It  tastes great. The combination of the sauce and the salmon is terrific and, when wrapped in the pastry, makes a great dinner which is easy to make. Be sure to dry off the salmon with a paper towel so that there is not too much moisture getting in to the pastry.

I made this using 2, 6 oz portions of salmon, adjusting the recipe in amount but otherwise according to the recipe as outlined.  My wife and I thought this was very good.  I would like to try using goat cheese next time instead of feta thinking that the goat cheese might improve over feta.  This recipe raises the bar for salmon.  Nice combination of spices & Mustard, spinach and cheese,  IF you are on a salt restricted diet, the salt could be omitted and not really noticed given the combination of other spices used.

Really awesome! I blanched fresh spinach and mixed the feta with the other sauce.

Loved it...but I gave it a 4 because I definitely doubled the recipe but only used 1 cup of mayo and 2 tablespoons of Dijon and it was a perfect amount...and i did sprinkle on black sesame seeds on the egg wash.  I also did a light drag of hash marks. It came out perfect...puffy and crispy too.

I made this with smoked salmon instead. Traded feta for cream cheese(I added a touch of milk to make more spreadable )and mixed in minced garlic with fresh herbs salt and pepper with a hand blender. Spread the cream cheese filling topped with spinach and smoked salmon and it was a hit! My brother and boyfriend are both chefs and loved it!

Tried this recipe last night & was not disappointed ! I followed the recipe for the most part, with the exception of the spinach. I used fresh spinach ,cooked it in a bit it butter & garlic first. I didn't see how many sheets of pastry (Phylo) people used. I used 5, but I think it was a wee bit too thick. I will make this again next week for a dinner party I'm having. It is a very attractive dish !

Easy to make. Perhaps ill lessen the feta cheese as there were portions that were salty. I had so much fun wrapping it with phyllo pastry to the extent that i have put so much. The pastry turned out sooo thick. The last salmon piece I only used 5 thin sheets of phyllo pastry.

Wonderful flavours!  Simple and forgiving, great for a novice like me.  Cut the Mayo and Dijon in half to cover 3lbs of salmon, worked great with only a little left over. Added chopped mushroom and shallots as an additional layer - because I like them.  Served with Lemon Asparagus risotto (found on this site)  NOTE - prepared the night before, for a lunch the next day.  Covered with tin foil and refrigerated. Worked fine!

This was an excellent recipe.  The only change I would make would be to saute some mushrooms and onion and add it to the spinach.  It was delicious!

I made this dish for Christmas dinner for my guessed who do not eat red meet. It was delicious and everyone absolutely loved it. 
few changes to my recipe, my fish was about 3 1/2 Ib and I used way less mayo that this recipe calls,  I also replaced Dijon mustard with fresh lemon juice, just because I did not have Dijon mustard at that moment, make sure you put the warped fish on a rack not straight on a pan since  it could get soggy. I also used fresh spinach sauté first and drained very well. it took my fish about 50 minutes to cook and 10-15 min cool down at room temp before serving.

Another recipe to add to the rotation for sure!  I am always on the look out for seafood and salmon recipes (I can only have so many honey mustard glazed salmons in a month).  This took a little longer than the normal fish recipe but it came out very juicy after the 45 min.  I definitely missed the reviews that said to cut the amount of mayo and mustard because I had over a cup left over. :( Still worth it!  I didn't even have spinach or feta (thought I did, but nope), but it still was very flavorful anyway.  I used the sauce from the Phyllo dough halibut filets with lemon scallion sauce recipe to add a little bit of lemony flavor to it, and YUM! I am having the leftovers for lunch, and still yum!

I LOVED this recipe! Delicious! I didn't change much except cutting both mayo and mustard in half as other reviewers recommended. I also used fresh instead of frozen spinach. This is my new favorite!

Heck yes! This recipe is amazing. I get asked to make it often. It's a little time consuming but worth the effort (if you have the time). Only change is; I use fresh spinach.

I made this tonight, followed the recipe exactly. My French chef beau RAVED about it, we will be making it for company this weekend. We used the little bit of extra sauce for dipping.  I served with oven roasted asparagus and smashed red potatoes. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!

This was a lovely winter meal. I made it in an old copper salmon mold and it looked great before we devoured it. I used fresh spinach and it was excellent.

Another really nice presentation is to boil asparagus for two min then put in ice bath or cold water.  Pace on top instead of spinach. Make sure to trim the stock before boil.  Charliegirl, Love the switch to blue cheese going to have to try that soon.

Amazing flavor combination!  Next time I will use even less Dijon mustard (I only put half in this time and it was still too much) or maybe I will omit it completely.  I also didn't have pie crusts, so I just layered the herb mixture, cheese and spinach on top of the salmon! Delicious!

The salmon turned out very moist and delcious. I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried ones, but still tasted excellent.Will make again.
