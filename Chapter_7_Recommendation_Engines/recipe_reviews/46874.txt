I've been a member of All Recipes for seven-ish years and rarely rate recipes, although I've tried probably close to 100 from this site. This chowder is divine. Changes: tripled the veggies, cooked for about 45 mins because I like a real soft vegetable consistency, used tilapia instead of conch. This is a very special chowder and will truly wow any self respecting lover of delicious food. Try it!

Amazing chowder! I made a few changes as I could not find conch at the time. I subbed a bag of shrimp and a bag of scallops. I doubled the amount of veggies in the soup and still found that I could have added more (I really love a hearty chowder) I omitted the bell pepper due to dietary restrictions and added mushrooms, garlic and red onion. After getting the soup to a boil, I reduced the heat to low for an hour and a half, adding only half the cilantro and a little extra hot sauce after 15 minutes. Once I was almost ready to serve I got the soup back up to a boil, that is when I added the raw shrimp and scallops and then turned the element off and allowed the seafood to cook in the already hot soup.  This way I was able to get all the flavors from the wonderful veggies, ginger, fish stock ect and NOT overcook the seafood. This is a new favorite in my house! Thanks for the great recipe!

very good I made a few changes to the recipe I used 3 small golden yukon potates, no coconut milk veggie broth instead of fish and used more since I did not use the coconut milk. I used two stalks of celery and more conch. I recommend using fresh corn it made a difference.

This soup was absolutely AMAZING. I know I made some pretty large changes but I would like to add them here for anyone interested in lightening this up. I used fat free half and half and lite coconut milk and it turned out perfectly thick/creamy. Also tripled/quadrupled the amount of the veggies and added a few cloves of garlic and used sriracha as my hot sauce. Used shrimp and tilapia instead of conch and just added them raw in at the end and let it simmer for 15 minutes instead of the beginning step. The way I made it is very filling and colorful! I will be making this again and again!

So good. Made a couple of changes just because of what I did or didn't have on hand. Used shrimp in place of the conch. Didn't have fish stock on hand because of this, so used two containers (11 oz) of coconut water. These also replaced the coconut milk. Then added water with some bouillion to make up the difference. The soup was waterier than I thought it would be, but I'm pretty sure it was because I didn't add the coconut milk. But I also think if you want it thicker you should cook the flour, butter and half&half to more of a thickness before adding the other ingredients. With that being said, even with it being waterier it was still, oh so delicious!

I served this to my guests at a dinner party last night and everyone, I'm not exagerating, everyone said it was the best chowder they ever had. I was of the same opinion. You wouldn't think that coconut and ginger would go so well together, but it was crazy good. You gotta try it.

So good! I did change it a little bit because we don't have fish stock. I used clam juice and a dash of fish sauce. I replaced the conch with calamari and clam. Added squash and zucchini because we didn't have carrots. Put in thai chili peppers and fresh garlic. We didn't have green onions, so I added chives and a shallot.

Very good with a wonderful flavor. Since 1985, it's illegal to take live queen conch in U.S. waters. Most conch in the USA now comes from only 3 Caribbean islands, as most have stopped exporting it. I found fresh conch at a local specialty market for $12.99/lb. but that's a rare find. Conch is naturally tough, and the reason for finely chopping it in a food processor (a meat grinder using a medium-fine plate also works). This chowder base is easily adaptable. Some reviewers mentioned subbing shrimp and fish for conch, and scallops would be another excellent substitute (see "Chef John's Bay Scallop Chowder" on this site). Consider altering or eliminating  step 1 cooking method if substituting other seafood for conch.

I was lucky and my giver had received a case of conch in error and had it in the fish case.  I latched on to a pound real quick and made this receive.

This is terrific! I had to use haddock and shrimp in place of conch since I live in New England and hubs and I went to battle over who got the leftovers :)

I really wish I could get good couch in my neck of the woods, but alas I had to make due with a combo of crabmeat and clams.  Really loved the sweet potato and veggies with the coconut milk broth, but I wish I would have added more flavor.  We felt it lacked a certain brightness.

I needed to use up two small pkgs of frozen tilapia which equaled 1/2 lb, so I went with that in place of the conch. I used butter in place of the margarine and subbed  vegetable broth for the fish stock. I only used half of a pint of the half and half, and it worked out fine.  In place of the hot sauce, I added Siracha sauce until I got the spiciness that I preferred. This will most likely be better after it stands a bit.

Delicious! I substituted shrimp for the conch meat. I added in grated garlic ,  sprouts and snap peas for a more hearty soup. I recommend adding in 1-2 teaspoons of Asian fish sauce as well as a tablespoon of Thai red curry paste to kick up the flavor.

Delicious!  After reading the other reviews - I made the following changes. I used quadruple of the fresh corn and  triple of all of the other veggies. I used 4 Tbsp of butter w/ the veggies when I cooked them. I followed the recipe for the remainder of ingredients - except I went ahead and poured in the full carton of Sea Food stock. I added the hot sauce & cilantro after the 15 minutes - then simmered for another hour (stirring every 15 minutes).  Took it to a party (keeping it warm in a crock pot) where there were 2 clam chowders - my conch chowder was the biggest hit.   It was pricey to make it w/ real conch - next time I will substitute scallops like the other reviewer.

Very good,  I increased some of the vegetables. 
Next time I might add some shrimp or crab to the conch.

Used clam, not conch. Cooked down further because I like a thicker base. Added a potato. Turned out fantastic! Super easy and delicious.

Love this recipe!  Instead of conch, I use shrimp, squid and fish.
