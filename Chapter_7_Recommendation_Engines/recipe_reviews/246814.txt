I used 1 tsp of seasoning salt for the salt/pepper to taste area. It was good, will probably make again, but not extraordinary. I feel like just a little something would take it up to 5 stars -- just haven't figured out what that little something is. Update: Just made it again, this time adding another slice of prosciutto, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 C parmesan, and reduced seasoning salt to 3/4. Now we're talking 5 stars!

These were good. I didn't get the potatoes as dry as I should have. A little Ranch Dressing tasted good with these. Nice.

Very nice!  I used 4 smaller russet potatoes, rinsed in cold water and spun dry in the salad spinner.  The amount of egg / flour was just right.  Make sure to dry your potatoes well for a crispy finish.  I used a cast iron skillet which really helps to form a nice golden brown fritter.  Thanks!
