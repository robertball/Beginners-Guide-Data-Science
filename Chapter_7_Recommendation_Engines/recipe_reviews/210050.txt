I'm kind of torn on this recipe. I loved the idea of Sheperds Pie in a crock pot but it didn't quite work out for me. I was concerned with the amount of juice that would come from the meat and the veggies and adding water to it. So I coated the beef chunks in flour to help thicken the liquids. I used about 3 T for a double recipe. It did thicken up the juices but not enough. For the potato/cauliflower mix I cut the milk out and used 2T butter and only about 2 T of cream I didn't want them to be to moist with all the other juices going on in the dish. Also added salt and pepper to the potatoes. And I stirred in about 1/2 c of cheese into them as well. The juices from everything kind of seeped into the potatoes and sort of made them disappear. I even drained off about 1 cup of liquid during the cooking. I also sprinkled the cheese on top of the potatoes during the last 30 minutes of cooking. Its a really nice idea but just kind of fell flat. I did like the bacon added to it. Definitely needs some salt.

This is very good! We will be making it again! I followed the recipe except I omitted the milk and I added a cup of green beans. I topped it off with a cup and a half of shredded cheddar cheese.

I thought there was something missing in this dish. The flavour wasn't screaming at me and that is what i always look for in a dish. The mash was not how I would have approached it: too runny and the beef felt quite dry.
