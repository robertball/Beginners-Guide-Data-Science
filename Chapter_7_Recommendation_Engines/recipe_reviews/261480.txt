I had never tried persimmons in any form before these cookies. 
The recipe was well received, and the cookies disappeared fast...but a few things of note of the recipe as written... the glaze is not a glaze, it's icing. it is way way to thick to drizzle on anything, nor did it harden.  I didn't do any of the fancy decorating, just good cookies and tasty icing was fine with us
