Would the people posting these recipes get the information right first. This is the second time that I have thrown away money on a recipe that didn't work. I followed it the recipe to the letter, and put as instructed the batter in a 9" round pan and minutes into baking the batter poured over onto the oven floor. I am willing to bet that it should have been two 9" pans instead of one. Thanks, but your recipe and or directions is extremely flawed. And to think what I could have done with that 20 bucks.

It's yummy, but I made it with one 9" cake pan and it overflowed in the oven, I would use two 8" pans.

ABSOLUTE BEST recipe for carrot cake in the history of carrot cake! That's my wife's, both teenage daughter's and my grandson's opinion! Be careful! Deliciously decadent...morning, noon and night. Eat the last with butter and tall glass cold milk....YUM! THANKS

I like this cake because it does not have oil but the directions omit to say it should be baked in 2 8inch pans or equivalent otherwise you will have a mess and waste of expensive ingredients.  Also, sugar can be cut back.  For us any cake that is too sweet is not to our tastes but then we are in the minority.   I might add it takes a bit longer to make a carrot cake with butter but the finished product is superior.  Thanks for submission.

This is a great cake recipe..I know it says a 9 in. pan but the picture looks like it was fixed in a bundt pan, not a single 9 in. pan...I put in two because of the amount of batter I had I know it would run over. I will make this again.

Serves 12 to 16. I  replaced the nuts with raisins and coconut so that my kids could take this to school in their lunches. For a healthier cake, used applesauce instead of butter and used 75% of the sugars. Really tasty and a nice texture. The batter did fit in one cake pan for me, though I used a special shaped pan similar to a detailed Bundt pan. I checked the cake at 1 hour and (bearing in mind my changes) think it could have been taken out five minutes earlier. In terms of flavour I think the cinnamon was a bit too prominent: maybe half the amount is better. Thanks for a good recipe.  :) 
Finally, regarding the pan size problem that others have had. My cake pan had an 8-cup capacity, and there was no overflow. Some 9" pans MAY be large enough; the overall volume depends on the height as well as diameter. I recommend measuring the capacity of your pan before starting, or using a Bundt.
