Very easy, very quick, very delicious!  And like another reviewer said, looks stunning on the plate.  I added more spinach because I had a pile of it and we all love it;  I served it with pilaf and a crisp fennel salad, and it was a great meal.    The only thing I think detracts from the dish is the bouillon cube.  It made the sauce taste a little fake on my palate.  I'd say skip the cube and use chicken broth instead of water.  Next time I think I'll also add a lemon juice to the cooking sauce because the flavours would be very complementary.

UPDATE:  Since I reviewed this recipe, I adapted it to serve at a caf√© where I served as head chef for a time, and it was an absolute HIT!  Other than the changes above, I stopped using flour altogether (I don't think a light sauce is a sin; besides which there's no runny sauce that can't be mopped up with something yummy), used cherry tomatoes instead of diced ones, and most importantly, added baby spinach leaves in the last two minutes of cooking, just so they wilt and are still bright green.

Decent base to start with but I updated it - since I can never follow a recipe :)  

I mixed the cheese, lemon juice, and oregano with freshed crushed garlic, some red pepper flakes, salt & pepper AND the spinach.   I stuffed the mixture into a pocket I had created in the chicken breast (I did not pound it out).

I browned the chicken and put it into a greased casserole dish.   I pour the broth (2 cups --I didn't use bullion and water) over the top with a little white wine (1/2 cup), some lemon juice (about 1 TBS) and garlic powder.  I baked at 350 degrees for about 1/2 hour till the juices ran clear.  Then I put the liquid from the chicken into a sauce pan and thickened with corn starch.  I added about 3 TBS of diced petite cut tomatoes, a little more oregano and one pat of butter stirred into the sauce just before serving.   I served this over couscous with a greek salad on the side.  WOW!!! 

Thanks for the "base recipe".

I recently served this dish for a dinner party of 5, and everyone said it was restaurant quality. It's fantastic recipe both in flavor and in presentation. Personally, I don't like messing with meat mallets and toothpicks, so I simply cut pockets in the chicken breast halves and stuffed them with the feta mixture. It was delicious and a huge time saver! Next time I will increase the feta mixture because I ran out when I got to the last breast. I also had to increase the flour, salt & pepper mix (for the breading). I guess I must have been using larger chicken breasts that just took a bit more ingredients. Because several reviewers commented on the thin sauce, I used 2 tbsp flour for the sauce instead of just one. With the fully breaded chicken and the flour in the sauce, I had no problem with thickening, and it was the perfect consistency - although, I did end up simmering the dish about 30 minutes rather than 10 as suggested. My final improvise was to use an entire bag of fresh spinach (I imagine it must have been about 4 cups). It was not too much, and again, it was great in both flavor & presentation. I served over orzo, which was good, but I think I will try couscous next time. My family is already asking me to make this dish again!

Great recipe!  I pounded the chicken & marinated it in fresh lemon juice, olive oil (just a touch), salt, pepper, garlic & oregano before leaving for work.  Came home & followed the rest of the recipe (doubling the tomatoes, spinach & using prepared broth + 2Tbsp. cornstarch).  It was delicious, especially served with couscous!  Light, tasty & healthy!  I liked the addition of garlic, but that's just me.  Mmmm...the flavors were so refreshing!
HINT: If you serve w/ potatoes, use the water from boiling potatoes to mix the bullion & it's an instant thickener!

Very, very good.  Moist, healthy, and delicious.  My variation was to slice pocket into the chicken breast instead of pounding, and stuff with feta mixture.  I browned it in half a tbs. of butter first.  I also used frozen spinach and canned tomatoes, because that's what I had.  I really liked it, and so did my S.O..

My 16 year old son and I made this for his school project. We really liked it. We used arugula rather than spinach. I would recommend using double the spinach and tomato. We also thought the sauce was way too thin and stirred in some corn starch. We used chicken broth instead of water/bouillon and used the rest of the broth to cook the couscous in. We also mixed chopped scallions & pine nuts into the couscous. Delicious and very elegant!

This is a 4 star recipe as is, but can definitely be enhanced by following these directions.  Next time I will double the amount of feta crumbles (2 containers instead of 1).  I used 5 breasts and one container only left enough flavor for a subtle hint of the feta.  I squeezed half of a lemon into the cheese mixture, and next time I will use the other half to squeeze on the outside of the chicken while it cooks.  I used an entire bag of fresh baby spinach, and will do that again next time too.  In addition, I am going to omit the flour next time and just season the chicken breasts with some salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic.  The flour was pretty pointless and it didn't help to thicken the sauce up at all.  I ended up adding about 2 1/2 t. of cornstarch to cold water in order to thicken the sauce.  I strongly dislike runny sauces with meat, and next time I will actually up this to about 1 T. of cornstarch.  I also ended up filling the chicken breast in the middle and then pulling up each side of the breast on top of the filling and sticking toothpicks in that way.  Folding it over was not going to work for me, and I think the filling stayed it better this way.  This was good, but I would have preferred a slightly more lemony flavor to it, and a bit of a thicker sauce.  Both things are easy to rectify, but for those reasons I can't give it 5 stars.

This dish is really delicious.  I followed the recipie exactly and it turned out perfectly. I served it on a bed of angle hair pasta.  In addition to tasting great, the combination of the chicken, tomatoes and spinach present beautifully on a plate.  I am planning on serving this at my next dinner party.

This was absolutely phenomenal!  I served it with pinenut cous cous on the side and poured some of liquid from the chicken dish over the cous cous to keep it from being dry.  My 8 yr. old - picky-eater son LOVED it and has begged me to make it at least once a week since!  My husband, who hates feta cheese even loved it.  The only thing I had to change was the cooking time.  It needed more like 15-20 minutes instead of 8-10.
Fabulous recipe...thanks for sharing!

I followed some of the other suggestions and substituted chicken broth, added extra spinach and tomatoes and added a little lemon juice to the broth.  Excellent, complex flavors served over farfalle.  The combination of the feta, spinach, lemon and chicken broth was well balanced and refreshing.  I too found that the prep time was understated.  None the less, easy with a nice presentation.  A great change of pace.  A keeper.

This dish was easy and fairly quick.  I haven't cooked anything Greek before and this dish confirmed that I should do it again!  It was very yummy. I wasn't sure how much cheese mix to put in the chicken.  I wanted to make sure it had plenty of flavor in there.  Turns out you only need a little bit.  It is very flavorful.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to maybe put half the amount of lemon juice in.  Perhaps substitute the rest with water.  The lemon was a little overpowering.

Pretty good! I do feel this needs some "tweaking" to be a 5 star recipe tho. First off, let me say that this takes WAAAY more than 20 min. to prepare. By the time you trim your spinach, chop your tomatoes & pound / stuff your chicken, the time zooms by! Another thing to note.... Most everyone has added extra flour or switched to cornstarch to thicken the sauce. A sauce doesn't have to be thick to be considered "sauce." Sauces are lovely when thin - a drizzle of "light" sauce over each chicken breast is exactly what OAKLEY intended. Having said this, I did find it necessary to enhance the sauce a bit (it was lacking "oomph," IMHO). Even though I only prepped 3 breasts, I made enough sauce for 6 breasts. I used chicken broth instead of H2O / bullion & in place of 1/2 c. worh of it, I subbed white wine. I also added a T of fresh lemon juice & 2 minced garlic cloves. I used quite a bit more spinach (1/2 of my 1 lb. pkg. = ~ 5 c.) & 1/2 a pint of halved grape tomatoes rather than a chopped tomato. Both my hubs & I do not care for sauteed spinach, so I added mine during the last 2 min. of cooking time as Morena did. The spinach retained its beautiful, bright color & was only slightly wilted which was perfect for us. All in all, this was very good, but I'd omit the spinach / tomato next time. I really don't think they add to the dish (the sauce, w/ my enhancements, stole the show!). Served w/ couscous & focaccia, this was a decent meal. Thanks for sharing OAKLEY! :-)

I found this exact recipe in a Gooodhousekeeping years and years ago. It is such a good recipe. Super easy but elegant enough for company. I find it has terrific flavor exactly as is. Fresh spinach and good roma tomatoes are a must.

The fact that my father, who hates cheese (except in sandwiches), ate this and liked it says alot about how delicious this dish is. It is a tad too sour for my taste so I cut down on the lemon juice the second time I made it and it was EXCELLENT. I'm craving it right noww!!

AMAZING! I made this because it had such good reviews--and wow! It was very easy and quick to make, the presentation was beautiful with the sauce poured over the chicken breasts. I served it with greek salad and garlic bread, and of course wine.  Perfect for candlelight. You really will think you are in a restaurant!

To make a thicker sauce, I removed the chicken and added the flour to the leftover juices and oil and made a thin paste.  Then cooked the flour for about 2-3 minutes but careful not to let it burn.  Added chicken broth gradually, thoroughly mixing each time.  Then I proceeded with the recipe, and it thickens as it boils.  Tasty!!

I was skeptic about the feta cheese in chicken but was pleasantly surprised.  Next time I will use more spinach and tomatos and the sauce does need to be thickened a little more with flour or cornstarch.  Recommend serving over Angel hair pasta.

We found this to be a very tasty dish.   I think that 1-1/2 c. of water with only one Tbs. of flour for thickening makes for a very "soupy" sauce.   I am going to make this again but will experiment with either less water or more thickener such as corn starch.  My husband and I both agreed that if the sauce would be thicker it would be a wonderful topper for cooked rice.

Mmmm this was so good. I doubled the vegetables in the recipe, used chicken broth instead of a boullion cube and water, added sauted red onion and garlic and added a bit more flour to thicken the sauce. I served this with bulgar wheat. Very tasty.. was even better as leftovers. I will be making this again. It was very fast, once you got past the pounding of the chicken.

this is one of my favorite meals.  i'm so glad i found this recipe.  however, i give it two stars because it turns out awful if you make the recipe as it states here.  biggest change - omit that water/bouillion/tomato concoction.  all i do for this recipe is:  pound out boneless skinless chicken thighs.    mix together feta cheese, chopped spinach, fresh lemon juice, salt, and pepper.    add some of the mixture to each thigh and roll up.    put them in a dish and bake them in the oven.  baste OCCASSIONALLY with a bit of broth to prevent drying out.    this recipe, as is, has way too much liquid and turns into a wet, sloppy mess.

I made this for my boyfriend and he absolutly loved it. I took other peoples suggestions and used chicken broth instead and it was awsome. I mixed 2 tbs of cornstarch in the broth and the remainder flour and the sauce seemed perfect to me. Instead of just one tomatoe I also used a bunch of cherry tomatoes and probably doubled the amount of spinach. Definatly a wonderful recipe!

I pounded the chicken before I read the reviews, I will create a pocket next time. Even though I didn't quite have enough feta and used Italian Seasoning, it turned out so good. I did bake it at 350 for 30 minutes after pan browning. Then while the chicken baked I tossed the spinach( about 4c )into the frying pan with a can of diced tomatoes, a sprinkle of pepper flakes for heat, a few chopped garlic cloves, a cup of chicken broth, and some Italian seasoning. I added some cornstarch to thicken it up and served this over the chicken. My husband who is not a chicken lover asked me to fix this again

I was just wondering why some people rate a dish low after they dinkered with and changed the recipe. Does the low rating mean they tried it as it was written and then made changes the next time because they didn't like it. OR does it mean that, after dinkering with the dish, they didn't like it. If that is the case, are they not really rating their own ability to make the dish better. Just wondering. This dish was excellent just the way it was written.

This sauce was VERY THIN and there was not quite enough flavor for me.  I WILL make again, though, because the presentation was beautiful and I loved the mix of ingredients. Will use chicken broth instead of water; ( still use the boullion also), about   1/4 c white wine,  and double the veggies. I think the added flavor will make the thinner sauce acceptable, and get it to a five star recipe.

This was very tasty. The sauce was a little too soupy so next time, I'll either add more flour or less water. I also might try chicken broth instead of water. Thank you!

This was SOOOO good. I used broth instead of boullion, so the sauce was a little bland, but that was my fault, not the recipe. I used balsamic instead of lemon juice and it added just a touch of sweetness that was perfect! This is a hit and will be a repeat performance in our houes!

Delicious.  Followed others advice and cut pouches, mixed garlic into cheese mixture (used sun dried tomato and basil feta), reduced  liquid amount by 1/2 and used chicken broth instead.  Thanks!

Good recipe! I used 3 boneless chicken breasts and cut each lengthwise for a total of 6 pieces.  I did not have to pound them since they were thin enough after cutting.  I added 1/4 cup white wine to the sauce for extra flavor.  The sauce was delicious spooned over the chicken as well as the rice that I served on the side.

Thought the recipe would taste great since I love anything with feta.  It was too soupy, chicken fell apart and I ended up throwing out all the leftovers.  One of the most disappointing recipes I have made from the website.

Boy is this good. I was afraid, despite so many postive reviews, that it would be a bit bland so I added sauted red onion, garlic, extra lemon and oregano to the sauce. I also used alot more spinach and tomato. Im sure it would've been very tasty without these additions, though. I also had to use alot of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

Yummy!  I love greek style food...especially anything with feta.  Hubby and daughters enjoyed it as well!  Younger daughter asked for more leaves (I didn't dare tell my daughters it was spinach).  I added some spinach leaves on top of the cheese mixture in the chicken before folding, and added 2 bouillon cubes to the water, as I didn't have broth like others recommended.  Older daughter enjoyed helping and taking out her frustrations with the meat mallot...good therapy for her! Definitely will make again and again!

This dish was excellent!  Stuffing the chicken was a little cumbersome so we decided to try a quick and easy spin.  We tossed the feta with lemon and oregano in on top of the chicken as the last step.  We also added lots more spinach (more than double what the recipe called for) and tomato.  Overall this is one of the best and most beautiful recipes I have ever prepared!

I LOVE this recipe - so much so that I claim it as my 'signature' dish.  To save time and mess I often skip pounding, stuffing and dredging the chicken.  Just saute chicken, set aside, prepare the sauce mixing in the cheese, lemon and seasoning, and add chicken back to the pan for a minutes. The feta does a great job of thickening the mixture.  Use this recipe with thick fillets of snapper or rockfish too.  Awesome!

Like another reader had mention, this is a really great base recipe. I sauteed fresh garlic for the dish and added a half cup of white wine as well and still found it lacking a little in flavor. Red pepper flakes, perhaps a little more lemon juice, garlic and wine and this will be fabulous! I will add more spinach next time as well and will also omit the flour, agree with another reviewer, this would be better for my tastes with a clear sauce. Served this over fettucine. Great recipe with so many possibilities!!

This was a great dish!!  I served it over rice as suggested. I did add a bit of greek seasoning to the flour mixture and into the chicken broth mixture as well, other than that, i wouldn't change anything about this delicious meal!

Tried this recipe when we had guests for dinner and everyone loved it.  So much so they asked for the recipe and then sent it on to their daughters!  As per other reviews, I chose to make pockets instead of pounding; added greek seasoning to the flour mixture; dipped the stuffed chicken breasts in a beaten egg first then coated with the flour mixture; fried until nicely browned on both sides; transferred the chicken to casserole dish and baked in oven for 15- 20 minutes; to the sauce I added 1/2c white wine and a generous tbsp of flour and some more greek seasoning to taste; used quartered grape tomatoes and 3c. torn spinach; added the spinach last and cooked until just wilted and still bright green; poured the sauce over the chicken and it was ready to eat.  I server this with couscous and a greek salad.  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing your recipe

This is delicious. This so good and so simple. It just proves that a classically good dish isn't necessarily the most complex. I served this with a Greek style salad, and hot chick peas with roasted red bell peppers.
Thank you for this one. It's a keeper!

awesome recipe.  I had HUGE breasts from Sams Club (about a pound each) and decided to make a pocket too.  Worked out great, but they did take about 30 mins to cook at about 350 in the skillet.  I didn't think about the thicker breast/longer cooking time thing so my timing was off...no big deal, the meal was worth the wait!

Yum!  My husband and I really liked this one.  For some reason it was significantly better than some similar feta chicken recipes I've tried.  I halved the recipe and used one breast and two thighs, also used fresh oregano that I happened to have.  I like that it is all made on the stovetop which makes it quicker and means you don't need to heat up the oven!  Good served with an orzo salad.

This really sounded great.  I followed the directions exactly and was disappointed.  There was very little flavor to the meal, other than the few bites of filling.  I ended up dousing everything with Italian dressing, which really helped it out.  Marinating the chicken in the dressing probably would have been a good idea.

Excellent recipe--I loved the Greek taste of the feta/oregano/lemon juice stuffing--I had no idea it was so easy!

I took the breasts out once they were cooked, thickened the remaining sauce with some corn starch, and served it over orzo.  Delicious!

This was deliciously delicious.  It was difficult to make, but it was my first time to make it.  I almost lost my mind with the toothpicks, I would make sure to use large breasts.  Of course, large breasts are always better than small ones.  It was one of the tastiest meals I've ever made.

We really enjoyed this.  The sauce went really well with some french bread.  Next time I'll add more tomatoes (I used canned) and more spinach leaves (I used 3 cups).  Yummy!  This is a follow up... this time I used 2 cans of diced, peeled tomatoes drained and at least 4 cups of spinach (about 8 oz).  I also used the mediterranean  feta cheese and it was great.  I'm still having a hard time keeping the chix together and browning it so I think next time I'll cut the pieces in half and it will be easier to fold.  third time= pounded chicken, put mediterranean feta in middle and rolled up with toothpicks.  browned.  then took out and added water, bouillon, large can diced tomatoes and flour to pan.  brought to boil added chick and covered. toward end (after 15 minutes) added lots of spinach and covered.  yummy.  served over rice pilaf.

This is so good!  I took someone's recommendation to cut pockets into the breast instead of pounding it.  I didn't have lemon so I used lime which worked just fine.  I cannot stop raving about this dish.  What a tasty way to prepare bland chicken breasts.  If you like feta cheese then you will love this recipe!  Thanks Orisha for sharing such a yummy recipe.

Awesome dish! I served it with Basmati rice. I also chipped in some Kalamata Greek olives and added them with the tomatoes and spinich. I used more Feta than asked for, as well as more oregano, twice the spinich and chicken broth. But...I tend to add more of most things in recipes. My husband loved it! The sauce is outstanding. Makes lots of it...you'll want to for the rice. :)

OK, but probably wouldn't make this again.  If I did, I would add the spinach at the last minute, not before the simmering.  I used real broth, not boullion.  I also would make a pocket in the chicken, not fold it over.  Maybe serve it over orzo.  It is very saucy.

I had such high hopes for this recipe with all the great reviews.  But, for some reason, mine seemed a tad bland.  I served it over rice.  But it just didn't work for us, sorry. It certainly wasn't bad, but just not worth all the work that went into it for a mediocre dish.

In our house we buy boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them up into bite sized pieces.  That allows better portion control for those of us who *ahem* ought to be eating smaller portions.  So I modified this recipe by doing that, and quickly pan-frying the chicken before putting it in a casserole dish with ice-cube sized portions of frozen spinach (still frozen), chopped tomatoes, and the feta mixture on top.  I covered with foil and put in a 350F over for about 20 minutes, then took the foil off for about 5-10 minutes.  I still needed to microwave it before serving for a minute because I hadn't cooked the chicken enough in the pan, and with the foil off the feta began to brown, but this was delicious!!  I will make this again, only I will cook the chicken more thoroughly and I will use a tin of tomatoes instead of chopping fresh and also defrost the spinach first.  I will leave off the feta until the last 10 minutes so it can release the extra moisture in the oven without me worrying about the feta burning.

This was good for a quick and easy meal that was a little out of the ordinary. One T. of flour was definitely not enough flour to coat 6 breasts. I needed about 1/2 c. for four breasts. I love feta cheese, but did not like lemon juice in it--too strong. And next time I will add more feta cheese than called for. The broth and vegetables were nothing to rave about; will definitely add more spices next time. Overall, though, this is a pretty good recipe.

This was a really great meal! I used a teaspoon of dried chicken stock instead of the bouillon cube and omitted the flour- it didn't need it. I used a whole tomato and a whole bag of spinach for the 2 of us too, and served over garlic and olive oil couscous. It was very different from what I usually  cook, so a nice addition to my recipe box

Excellent!  For ease, I opted to pound the chicken to even thickness then cut a pocket into each.  For the stuffing, I added chopped baby spinach and some lemon zest. Instead of coating the chicken in flour, I seasoned it with Greek Seasoning blend from Cost Plus World Market (spices are so cheap there!).  I again skipped the flour and sauce, but still finished cooking the chicken in some chicken stock with a few squeezes of lemon.  I wilted the spinach and tomato separately in olive oil, but added diced red onion and garlic and served with some crumbled feta.  Also made a rice pilaf with a brown/wild rice mix, orzo, celery, onion, garlic, chicken stock, and Greek seasoning blend.  Was a very nice dinner.

My family just loved this recipe.  As others suggested, we sliced open and stuffed the boneless chicken breasts, secured with toothpicks. To "sauce" in pan we added a little flour to thicken before we added spinach. Add 1 & 1/2 bag of baby spinach & chopped tomatoes the last 5-6 minutes so it retained it's bright color while it wilted down. Sprinkled a little feta cheese crumbles on top when we served it. ******** Served over couscous mixed in with 4oz can saute chopped canned mushrooms and sliced green onions. A+ recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I even had to tweak for gluten free and lactose free and it was still delicious. Skipped the feta filling and simply sprinkled chicken with greek seasoning and a squeeze of lemon before folding. Doubled tomato and spinach just because. Great!

This recipe was amazing!!!! I followed the recipe as written all but one minor detail.  We had no spinach or any leafy green to put in the pan so I used the tomatoes and zucchini pieces.  It turned out wonderfully!  I have never made such an easy dish that packed so much flavour!   I served the chicken with a side of lemon roasted potatoes, but I think it would be just as tasty with rice OR pasta on the side!   Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!  It's a keeper at my house for sure!

Excellent!  Looks and tastes great and is easy to prepare.  I didn't change a thing except cut the recipe in half, but mine took more time to cook than the recipe indicated.  I'll add more spinach next time only 'cause we love it.  TY Oakley for a wonderful meal which we'll enjoy often.

AWESOME!! Followed recipe mostly but added 1 small jar of marinated artichoke hearts (drained), chopped katamta olives, 2+ TBSN capers and I used white wine, not chicken broth.  Also used canned petite diced tomatoes.

Loved it! My chicken came out a little hard, but that was my fault. It's a complicated recipe, but very original. The feta cheese is great with the chicken.

Loved this recipe!!!!  I made a few changes:  1)  used 2 tbsp flour to dredge, and added some greek seasoning to the salt, pepper and flour.  2)  used enough feta to have a little left over to sprinkle on plates when served.  Used about 2 tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice and also added greek seasoning to feta mixture. 3)  for sauce I did like others and used a small can of chicken broth, about 1/4 cup of wine, and instead of a fresh tomatoe, I used a large can of diced tomatoes.  It probably made the sauce a little more tomato-y than the original recipe but it was delicious.  I served it with tri-color vegetable fusilli pasta and my hubby (who hates feta cheese) loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent and easy.  My whole family loved it.  I couldn't tell what it was served on in the picture.  It looked like rice and corn so I cooked 1 can of corn with the juice with 1 1/4 cups of rice and 2 cups of water for the regular time (use your own rice cooking directions as a guide) and it came out great.  The only thing I did differently was double the flour mixture for coating the chicken.  One TBS didn't seem to be enough.  And the only instructions I'd add would be to cover the chicken with a piece of plastic wrap or a plastic bag while beating it.  The thought of raw chicken juice splattering around just grosses me out!  Thanks for a great recipe!  And a PS - this would be a great base recipe for other stuffings as well, not just feta, so if you have other good chicken stuffing ingredients on hand, or a different kind of cheese, this would still be a good recipe to use as a guide.

This was really good. Subsituted chicken broth for water and boullion. Loved the effect that the lemon had on the feta. Next time I'll add more of both as that was definitely my favorite part of the meal. This with definitely become a regular meal in my house. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I will definitely be making this dish many times again.  The chicken breasts I used were quite large so I cut each in half and made smaller portions which worked really well.  The feta and lemon juice adds a delicious tang to the dish.  I served it with rice but might try couscous next time.

This recipe is excellent!  The best thing I've tried on this website.  The spinach and tomatoes aren't enough for a side dish.  More of something to eat on top of the chicken.  This would be great with spaghetti and red sauce on the side!

YUMMY! My family really enjoyed this dish. I did it just a bit different, I only had two chicken breats to stuff but added some tenders cooked the same way dipped in the flour and fried. I also added 2chicken boulion and 2 beef to the water and man, oh man it was so Excellent. Oh and I used feta cheese already seasoned with lemon, garlic and oregano.(new at the grocers) All I can say is it was the bomb! I served over rice  ;o) Thanks for sharing...

This is so good! I get rave reviews every time I make it. I use goat and sheep mile feta from Isreal which has a stronger more authentic feta taste (I get it at trader joe's) and serve it over couscous, which soaks up the sauce.

This recipe was ok, but a little cumbersome to make. Perhaps my chicken breasts were too large because I had a hard time browning both sides of the chicken for just a few minutes. It was good, but would not be in a rush to make again.

Chicken was very good. Next time I would use diced canned tomatoes instead of wasting a fresh one!  Might add some black olives too.

This was really good. I used 1/2 the chicken and the full amount of spinach, it really cooked down.  Next time I will cook it in the chicken stock and when complete put it on a bed of baby spinach.

My husband LOVED this recipe.  I was amazed at how easy it is to prepare. I also added pitted Kalamata olives and capers and used a whole bag of spinach as well as substituting low fat feta...delicious!

C'EST BON!!! We added sliced black olives, capers, garlic, & artichoke heart/bottoms.  Also, lightly saute coated chicken and then stuff with spinach/tomato/olives BEFORE folding & toothpicks.  Mix water/bouillon/flour in advance.

This is fabulous!  I used cracked peppercorn feta to add some flavor and I used fat free chicken broth instead of the bullion and water.  Note ‚Äì if you stuff and ROLL the breasts instead of folding in half the cooking time will be MUCH longer.  Next time I will double the spinach ‚Äì it was kind of skimpy.  The flavor was incredible and made for a very healthy meal served over brown rice.

I liked this chicken recipe....I also used chicken broth to simmer the chicken, with a little
lemon zest added to it. I added the spinach towards the end, but I think I would add it sooner than that next time because it took longer to wilt than I thought.

Both my husband and I loved it.  The only changes I made was to use gluten free flour (my husband is gluten intolerant) and I added some Kalamata olives at the end of the cooking time.  Thanks for a fast easy and delicious recipe.

This was awesome! I probably used more pepper than salt in flour coating and used chicken broth instead of chicken bouillon; other than that no changes. I think next time I would like to add a little more flour to thicken up the broth and make some brown rice to serve it over because there was a lot of flavorful broth that got wasted.

This is my husband's all time favorite meal!  I use chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cube and  I do not flour the chicken because I find that the chicken gets soggy if I do so.  I also use a whole bag of spinch and I make this recipe with Brazilian rice as per another reviewers suggestion.

Good combination of flavors.  I think I would probably try grilling or broiling... I did not so much like the "boiled" texture, but I do like the flavors.

I left the liquid, spinach, and tomato out of this recipe and just fried the cheese-filled chicken as directed. It was easy and still very delicious. Goat cheese would also be a nice alternate to feta..

We just loved it! It was easy and yummy!  I used fresh oregano- (3 TBSP...2 mixed into the Feta, and 1 added to sauce for simmering), halved grape tomatoes, and 1 1/2 c. chicken broth as substitutions.  Also, to save time, I bought chicken breasts that are sliced thin already.  My children and husband loved it, and I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you for sharing!!!

I loved this just as is and so did the rest of my family! The sauce is not meant to be thick... It is a fresh thin sauce to wet the rice. The flavored are really good and would most definitely serve this again.

The feta stuffing is an excellent idea, but the spinach and tomatoes can turn out to be an unappetizing mushy mess if you don't get the flour/cornstarch and timing of adding the veggies right. Otherwise, the presentation is pretty gourmet. Flavor wise, it's not my favorite way to eat chicken.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  I did make some alterations.  I added approx. 1/4 tsp of garlic powder in the flour blend.  I also added approx. 1/4 cup of fresh shredded parmesan cheese to the feta, along with using fresh oregano instead of dried.  The only other changes were including a full bag of fresh baby spinach and 1 15oz can of diced tomatoes w/garlic, along w/vine ripened tomato. I also mix 1 TBS baking powder to the water/boullion mix so the sauce would thicken up.  Put that on top of cous cous w/ chopped roasted almonds.  OMG YUM!  And that's all I have to say about that!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I did as written.  I would thicken the sauce at the end and after thickening, I would add 2/3 of the spinach until just wilted.  If you have leftover sauce which I plan to next time, I would save to serve over homemade cheese ravioli.

Loved it!  Cut pockets into 4 cx breasts and added the chz, lemon juice, oreg, and a bit of red ppr flakes. Used red sodium cx broth/1 tbsp flour after browning the cx.  Added a can of diced tom with seasoning, simmered for 15 min and threw the spinach on top with 3-4 minutes to go.  Added garlic to the sauce too.  Served with cous cous (pine nut).  Planning to use the leftover sauce later this week for angel hair pasta (maybe add corn starch to thicken it up a bit)

This was delicious and a nice change. Everyone agree that it's a keeper. I served it on1/2 cup of River Rice. I also used canned dice tomatoes. I like making a pocket in the chicken breast with kitchen scissors. Never had any luck pounding the chicken breast. You should try it. Very quick
 dish.

Very good!  I combined many different reviewers ideas like cutting a pocket to stuff, using chicken broth and lemon juice instead of water, doubling the flour.  I also used feta with basil and sun dried tomatoes.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks

After reading the reviews, I tripled the flour mixture to make sure there would be enough.  Used a good meat pounder to thin the chicken; without this, it would have been very hard to fold the chicken over but I pounded it down to a half inch as the recipe said and had no issues.  I used one bag of baby spinach, and thought it was plenty.  Otherwise, made exactly as the recipe says.  It was easy to prepare, healthy, and delicious.

I also used chicken broth instead of buillion and slit a pocket on the chicken breasts rather than pounding them. I served it over plain couscous and the dish looked pretty and tasted wonderful.

The chicken itself is five stars, but the sauce really brings it down.  It was way too plain--like chicken gravy.  I was concerned it might be too bland, but I wanted to follow the recipe as written first, just in case something magical happened while it was all cooking together.  Not so.  All it needs is a little tweaking, though.  I'll definitely make it again, but I'll be adding more to the sauce.  I did end up sprinkling feta and lemon over the whole dish after tasting it and just doing that helped a lot.  It does look fantastic on the plate, by the way.

I followed the basic recipe with a few changes some of which I got from the reviews. I added garlic to the sauce and I used chicken broth instead of the bullion and I added some cream for a little more richness, used a bit more flour due to using more liquid and I added oregano to the sauce. It took more than 10 minutes to simmer, I would say more like 20 to 25 and I waited to put the tomato in the last 10 minutes and I seasoned the tomato with pepper and oregano also and then added the spinach the last two minutes. I served this with rice and a salad of greens with olives and a bit of feta cheese with a vinaigrette dressing. I must say this dish was a huge success. Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome recipe!  It is full of flavor, and looks very pretty!  I took other reviewers advice, and used 1 1/2C of chicken broth instead of the cube.  I also needed more flour to coat the chicken.  Will definately make again!!

This meal was excellent; however, I did make a few changes.  I used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth instead of water and chicken cubes and added 2tbsp butter.  I also simmered the chicken for about 30-45 mins and added the spinach towards the last 5 mins so that it woulded be too wilted or discolored. Served with Burnt butter rice from this site but used couscous in place of the rice that was cooked in chicken broth with garlic.  All was tasty.  Chicken was very tender and had lots of flavor. If you like thicker sauce I suggest adding corn starch mixed with a little broth or water.  Happy Eating.

Yum! A very nice change from the usual chicken dinners but incredibly easy to prepare. If you need to thicken up your broth sauce at the end, you can take 1/4 cup of cold water and add 2 T corn starch. Stir well and whisk it in with the sauce over heat, let simmer another 2 minutes. Surprisingly my young kids loved this.

This was good...but 2 tablespoons of flour is NOT enough to coat the chicken...I will make this again but with changes. First I will definitely dredge the chicken in way more flour, and I also found that it was a little bland for my taste and even after adding lemon and oregano to the mixture that was poured over it was still missing something...I will definitely play with it, but overall a good meal.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I also stuffed the cheese, lemon, oregano and spinach into slots in the whole breasts, as it is easier to brown this way.  I used fresh oregano, and added some sun dried tomatoes and garlic to that mixture.  I also cooked it in the oven with broth and wine, and extra garlic and oregano, then cooked the sauce down after the chicken was done.  Next time I will double the sauce.  Very good!

I thought it was great, but I'll use cooking twine to hold the breasts shut next time instead of toothpicks.  I'll probably also put kalamata olives in half of the breasts, so that those who like olives have a choice.  For the people who thought the taste was bad (boyfriend almost hurled) perhaps you just don't like feta cheese made from goat's milk.  I really like feta made with cow's milk but have trouble with the strong flavor in most goat's milk varieties.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  The first time I made it, I felt like a chef.  I am now assembling cookbooks for my sons and these will definately go in them.  I really don't think I would change a thing - well I do add alot of garlic to everything I cook, so maybe that.

This recipe is a yummy and easy way to make chicken a little more exciting.  Mine needed about double the cook time, and double the spinach, otherwise followed the recipe.

Moist, quite easy and cooks all the way through.  Not so flavourful though in my opinion; maybe mix some more spices into the feta or into the sauce (which only has 3 ingredients as is, besides the vegetables).  I might skip the spinach in the sauce in future - it got rather mushy - and instead make a spinach salad on the side.  Also, you may want to use more feta if you are making six decent-sized chicken breasts; I made only four and all the feta fit in, even then people said they wanted MORE cheese, though there was no room to fit any!

I thought this was just OK but my guy loved it.  I was only cooking 2 chicken breasts but I used 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth and added a LOT more spinach.  As another reviewer said -the prep time is a bit off - it took quite awhile to prepare - I love cooking but if you are in a rush this is not the recipe.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!  Very easy to make.  I did use chicken broth instead of the water and chicken bouillons.  Also, in the future I will use more spinach.  The amount the recipe calls for is not adequate.  And I did not use the lemon juice due to the the unfavorable comments from others that tried this recipe.  But again, this recipe was EXCELLENT!!!  Highly recommended!!!

I made this last night for a friend and we weren't very impressed. While the chicken did stay very moist, the taste was minimal at best.  We both agreed it didn't really "taste like anything".  I would add garlic & white wine to this if I decide to make it again.

We absolutely loved this.  It was so fresh and delicious!  I would double the spinach and tomatoe next time and thicken the broth with 2 Tbsp of cornstarch as another person suggested.  It was a wonderful low fat meal.  And only 6 points with weight watchers.:)  I have no idea why anyone would think it is bland....

This is a GREAT dish!  As suggested by previous reviewers, I used chicken broth instead of the water and bullion, added lemon zest to the sauce, and I increased the amount of spinach.  Also I removed the chicken after browning, added the flour and chicken broth and allowed it to thicken a bit before returning the chicken and adding the spinach and tomato.  Next time I think I'll try adding some capers, they would compliment this nicely.

While this was fairly easy to make it didn't have much flavor. I probably will not make this again. sauce was runny even after adding the suggested flour.

Very good. 
I used this for a party and everyone liked it. I doubled up the spinach and served it on the side. I also liked it with more oregano then was called for.

Excellent!!!!  I would reduce a little the amount of olive oil or use a cooking spray instead to reduce the amount of fat.  But it is flavorful!

I made this tonight and we really enjoyed the flavor.  It really tasted like something we might order at our favorite greek restaurant.  I substituted the chicken broth like those before and I added a lot more tomato and spinach than suggested.  The soup base that is left makes a great soup to be eaten on its own.

My husband who really isn't into food, really likes this one.  We both agree that broth is better than the bullion and not as salty.  I have put the remaining flour in as a thickener and it works fine.  Thanks for the quick and easy tasty meal idea!

This was terrific.  Followed directions exactly EXCEPT I did add a little red pepper flakes to sauce, extra spinach and threw in a few kalamata olives.  Although I only fixed 2'breasts, I kept sauce amount the same.

I made this today and used chicken broth instead of the bouillon cube/water.  Did everything else the same.  Gosh was it good.  Will definitely be making this often.  Would serve to company.

I halved the recipe but should have kept the same amount of spinach. It cooked down to about 1 serving. I cut a pocket in the middle of the chicken breast and stuffed it with the cheese filling.

DELICIOUS!  One minor change - I used one can of chicken broth in place of the water & bouillon cube which is close to two cups of liquid.  So I added a little more flour (approx. 1 1/2 T)  to the broth since there was more liquid.  Oh yes, I did use more spinach.  Can't wait to make this for friends!  It was "smack your lips" GOOD! BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION.

This was pretty tasty. I think the next time I make it, I'll add some lemon juice to the sauce as well, as the lemon flavor wasn't as strong as i would have liked. Really good though!

Love this recipe...in our house we like to experiment with different cuisines (3 kiddos). My kids are not picky, but are often hesitant when trying new things. This recipe was an instant hit with them...which usually translates to 4 or 5 stars from the grown up crowd. :)

Made a slight variation of this recipe. Our family likes our chicken cooked a certain way, and we had very thick chicken breast. So what I did was slice them thin first, (I also do not own a mallet) I then created little pockets and put the feta cheese mixture in. I needed a little more flour to coat the chicken breasts. I preheated the oven to 350¬∞. After frying the chicken in the olive oil, I put them in a 13 x 9" pan. Then I used 3 cups of chicken broth, 4 tablespoons of lemon juice, and three cloves of garlic, and added that to the pan with the chicken in it. Chicken was about halfway in broth. I then set the timer to bake at 350¬∞ for 50 minutes. After 30 minutes I then started preparing a rice pilaf made by Zataran's (2boxes). I substituted in the recipe for the rice pilaf Subtracting 1/4 cup of water for one large diced tomato. Steamed the spinach for five minutes. When rice pilaf was done I added half of the spinach to the rice pilaf for extra color, and some feta. I plated the dish with a layer of rice pilaf then spinach with the chicken on top, then added a ladle full of the broth that was cooked with the chicken. YUM! Will definitely be making this again and again!

Very tasty, but it does get a bit messy with the veggies and cheese everywhere.  It also took substantially longer to cook the chicken, but that wasn't problematic.  One solution is to add the tomatoes and spinach late in the process.

Yummy and moist! I put some lemon, oil and greek seasoning on the chicken after I had flattened it while I was prepping the rest of the dinner (just to marinate for 10-20 mins). Added some garlic to the cheese, broth instead of bouillon and otherwise made as stated. Came out good, not super flavorful but went great with the meal (made with Herbed Greek Roasted Potatoes with Feta Cheese from the site).

I have made this twice now and the people I have made it for, loved it! I had to use chicken cutlets because the store was out of chicken breasts (I shopped late at night) so I cut them into bite size pieces, sauteed them in the oil, added the rest of the ingredients and simmered until dinner...I also substituted  1 cup Pomi chopped tomatoes instead of the ripe tomato and it was delicious! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was a hit at a potluck. We thought it was a bit too watery.  Do not cover while cooking and perhaps reduce the water.  We cooked a double recipe and finished one in the oven and one on the stove.  Both were equally as good.  I would probably add in some yellow bell pepper for another layer of color and flavor.

Very good recipe.  But I found that the quantities were off. For 4 breasts I needed more flower and more cheese mix than what was called for.  But I adjusted and it was very good.  I will make this again.

I marinated it in the first 6 ingredients, along with garlic, lemon juice and greek seasoning. Rolled up the spinach, tomato slices and feta. I baked it for 40 minutes. Meanwhile on the stovetop I cooked the spinach, cherry tomatoes in chicken broth with cornstarch. Looks impressive.

This chicken was wonderful. It was moist, juicy and flavorful. I didn't dry it out this time! My kids loved it, even the 6 year old. My husband enjoyed it very much. I also love chicken, but I prefer to have a sauce or filling like this one did, or it's just too boring.  I used chicken broth as others suggested. I put some spinach and tomatoes and olives in the cheese mix and used more lemon than it called for. Next time I will use Kalamata olives instead of black. This is a new "regular" for our house. Oh, it did take longer to cook than the recipe stated, but I had enormous sized chicken breasts. I took the time to pound out the meat and I'm sure it cut down on the cooking time, which otherwise would have taken much longer.

Made this the other night and my husband said it was one of his favorite meals ever. I did everything exactly how was stated in the recipe and only added a little Greek seasoning to the chicken. Excellent!!!

Very good and great tasting. However next time I will use cornstarch instead of flour, the flour made it a little too heavy for my taste, my family loved it and I will make it again soon.

This was a very tasty recipe. My wife and I substituted garlic & herb feta cheese for plain feta and it added some extra flavor. The next time, we are going to try tomato & basil feta cheese.

Out of this world!!!!!!  Seriously, one of the best recipes I have pulled from this site!  It was delicious!  So much flavor!  Chicken can easily be prepared the night before or the morning of, and quickly cooked in the evening.  Only thig I did different was add a little cornstarch to the chicken broth since I like teh sauce to be a little creamier.

I made this dish for my family tonight and it was a big hit!! My kids hate spinach and all three wanted more! I paired it with Near East's Garlic and Olive Oil Pearled Couscous. Complemented the dish perfectly! This is definitely a keeper in the recipe box!!

The taste and flavor were good, especially once I thickened up the sauce at the end.  I used chicken broth because I had an open can in my fridge and for a simple sauce it turned out great.  

I don't recommend pounding and folding the meat like the recipe says.    Most of my feta filling fell out that way.  Definitely cut and stuff like the other reviewers mention.

I made this for a birthday dinner for a friend and everyone loved it.  Like many reviewers said, the sauce didn't thicken up but I was OK with that.  Everyone who attended commented on how colorful this dish was :)

This was very good just as it was.  I might add something for seasoning to the flour another time and I would not cook the spinach as long but the taste was great...very satisfying!  Maybe the novel part was that I actually had the right ingredients on hand and didn't HAVE to substitute anything for once!

I love this recipe- the sauce adds just the right touch. The only change that I made was that I sprinkled a little garlic powder into the flour mix before coating the chicken, and, I halved grape tomatoes instead of dicing a full size tomato. Just serve over your favorite rice, add a greek salad and presto! You have a delicious home cooked meal.

Let me just say, WoWZA! So good! I did follow the other recommendations about chicken broth and spinach. I served it over brown rice w/ all the yummy sauce. My husband says it is a new #1! and my 2 1/2 year old gobbled a huge plate! Was light and wonderfully refreshing!!

Wonderful flavor! The sauce was a great blend of flavors. The family was fighting over who got the last bit!!   I would double the feta, if you like it. I did use the canned tomatoes but will try fresh next time I make it. Looks so impressive yet simple to make!!

So easy and tasty. My husband said I should have a day off work more often but this was one of the fastest recipes to fix. I used chicken tenders and flattened them instead of breast folded in half and they cooked fast and tender. I WILL make this one again.

Interesting dish..followed the recipe exactly. Served over wheat couscous.  I liked the flavors, but would have doubled or even more than that of the spinach.

I have made this several times and it is always a huge hit. I use a can of chicken broth instead of the boullion. I like more sauce and this is the perfect amount. I also use more feta and spinach and cherry or grape tomatoes halved. I serve it over basmati rice. I have used angel hair but I prefer serving it over the rice. Thanks for the recipe, it is excellent!

This was delish! My husband said it was the best thing he has ever eaten. He loved the spinach. Like many other reviewers... we used much more spinach than the recipe called for because we just love it. It takes so great after being cooked in the broth. I also used chicken broth instead of a bouillon cube. I served it with the Greek Garbanzo Bean salad... both were fantastic!

Pretty great!  I didn't have time to make on the stove, so I put it all in a 9 x 13 and baked.  The flavor was great, but I needed to brown the chicken first for some color.  Oh well.  I will definitely make again.

This had nice flavor- though I adapted it extensively to make it into a quick 1 pot meal.  Didn't have spinach, tomatoes, or lemon juice.  Combined other ingredients (Scaled down to 2 ckn breasts) with cubed ckn and let simmer for flavor to blend.  Agreed with others that it was too salty- either don't add any salt, or skip the buillion.  I also added Greek Feta seasoning to the sauce.  Thickened with flour to our tastes.  Pretty good, my husband really liked it.  Feta in the sauce and crumbled on top really made the flavor!

I LOVE this recipe!  It is SO easy and very delicious as well.  The only thing I changed was bullion cube, the first time I made this dish it was way too salty.  Now I either use a bit of low sodium chicken stock, or a 1/4-1/2 of a bullion cube.  The feta cheese is very salty, so, in my opinion, little to no extra salt is needed for the dish.  Yummm!  Can't wait to make it again.

This was "mmm, sooo gooood" (according to my guests) and pretty easy except I didn't brown them very well and I wish I had. Hey, I'm a vegetarian, what can I say? I also did a whole breast, sliced it open and stuffed it rather that pounding and toothpicks. I know exactly what to do next time to make this even better. This is a good recipe though!

I thought the taste of this was excellent! Although I made a few changes. I ended up rolling the chicken breasts into pin wheels and baking for 35 min with a tad of the broth. I simmered the spinach and tomatoes with the rest and added some garlic and onion powder and more pepper to the sauce. Also added corn starch to result in a creamier sauce, and served over some white rice with fresh lemon juice. My brother HATES feta, but loved this dish. Thanks!!

I thought this was just ok.  I think you need to pound the chicken down as small as possible - otherwise it's just too much chicken.

really good, I will double the spinach next time and add corn starch to thicken up the sauce.  I served this over couscous cooked in chicken broth.  Easy and good, I will make this again soon.

Very good! Lighter than expected, without being bland. I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. My only real beef with this recipe is the skimpy amount of spinach called for. I ended up using th whole package I had (7 cups!) and could have used more by the time it shrunk down. Still, it's a keeper! Thanks for the recipe. :)

huge hit!! the only change I made was to double the feta (purely by taste, spinach and tomatoes and instead of pounding them out I made pockets. I think next time I will try pounding them out simply to see how they present that way..anyway, this is worth a try!! thanks for the recipe!

Great - I added a little squeeze of lemon juice to the chicken broth before simmering. This is a keeper thanks!

This was REALLY good! Next time I'll make sure to pound the chicken thinner - it didn't fold right and took much longer to cook, and the cheese fell out. My mistake! Great with small roasted potatoes.

Very colorful and attractive meal.  My company was impressed.  I added some garlic to stuffing mixture, used 1 can of chicken broth for chicken to cook in, added garlic, about 3 cups of spinach and grape tomatoes cut in half.  Served over couscous which we found a little "grainy."  Will try rice pilaf next time.  Definitely a keeper.

Loved this recipe.  Very quick and easy. I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, olive oil & some lemon pepper overnight. Other than that I followed recipe and it was very tasty.  I will certainly make this one again.  Thanks

One of my ALL TIME FAVORITES!!!  Thanks for the great recipe.  It's perfect as is.  I think the reviewer who completely changed the recipe then gave it 2 stars is nuts.

This recipe keeps calling me back.  I rated it 3 stars the first time, and I don't know why, maybe I was grumpy that day.  It is a wonderful tasty recipe that never fails.

This is soo great!!  The first time I didn't have tomatoes and it was scrumptious... I sauteed fresh chopped garlic in the olive oil before browning the chicken.  I have made it since with tomatoes.  Great with or without, but I highly suggest adding the garlic.... yuuummmmyyyyy!!!!!

I LOVE this recipe! It is healthy, easy to make and verrrrrry tasty! To make prep a little easier / faster, I skipped step 1. I first pounded the chickens flat, then laid them on the work surface. I scooped the feta right on the chickens, squeezed some fresh lemon juice on top, sprinkled with oregano, then folded and secured with toothpicks. I omitted the flour and chicken boullion and used chicken broth instead of water for the sauce.  I used cherry tomatoes (quartered), and didn't add spinach til last two minutes or so, so it doesn't get too soggy. I will make this again real soon. Thanks, Cousin Cosmo, for a delicious dish!

This recipe has great potential, put failed at my kitchen table the way it is written. The feta filling is wonderful, but my flour coating turned gelatinous in the pan! (Very possibly my fault!) I would try it again without using flour, or combine it with the Feta Chicken recipe off this site and bake it. I will try again, but with changes.

This dish was very good we've served it both with rice and egg noodles, and both are just as good.  The sauce is  very thin and very good but if you would like it to act more of a sauce than a broth you may need to add a couple more tablespoons of flour.  The spinach and tomatoes are best left to throw in last.  My family loved the chicken and i being a vegetarian threw in extra spinach and a few other vegetables and its flavor was delicious!!  **I did add a little punch of minced garlic** (we're garlic lovers though...i'm sure it's just a good with out it).  Enjoy...don't forget to have extra toothpicks handy to grab incase you can't get the chicken to stay closed!

This was AWESOME!  My family said it was my best recipe find yet.  I also used chicken broth instead of the bouillon cube which was a great recommendation.  Plus I added lemon juice after the broth boiled and threw in some sundried tomatoes for a little extra flavor!

This came out really good for me since I seasoned it more than the recipe asked.  I added red pepper flakes to kick up the flavor and used Turkish Sheep cheese instead (looks like feta, but much more creamy taste).  I didn't understand the chicken broth/flour mixture. It made my dish too watery.  Next time, I will use less. Red pepper flakes is the key folks! I also sprinkled the oregano all over the chicken breast.

I was disappointed in this recipe. It sounded like it would be outstanding but I found it to be really bland and lacking any flavor other than the feta. The only change I made was to used broth instead of the boullion cube but that shouldn't have made that much of a difference.

This was delicious. The feta...the sauce...it was all heavenly. I think it must depend on the cook as to how good the dish turns out, though, because I can't understand why else someone would rate this as only mediocre or even bad. I loved it. Thanks for the great recipe.

I was extremely disappointed in this meal, It was semi edible and I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting the broth for the boullion. My fiance' told me to never make it again and that he almost hurled after tasting it. I felt the same way about it. I was really hoping for the best with this recipe :(

This is a great tasting, easy prep meal during the week.  OR if you are having guest over the chicken will stay moist in the sauce...plus great presentation without a lot of work.  We followed the recipe as written and loved it!  Will make again!

I wouldn't exactly call this recipe quick but it is definately worth the effort. We loved it and will make it again. Instead of using salt and pepper I used a greek seasoning mix. I served the chicken, spinach and sauce over tri colored pasta that I mixed with olive oil, the greek seasoning and a little garlic powder. When you cut the chicken up and the feta falls out onto the noodles it makes a delicious sauce. We loved it.

This is a real winner!  Easy, easy, easy, and delicious.  My local Fareway sells a product called "chicken tenders" which are breast meat strips.  These worked beautifully, and a pound served my husband and I with one stuffed packet left over (with one stuffed husband left, too!).  What a great blending of flavors.  We'll be making this again and again.  Next time I will make some pasta, too, because the sauce was tremendous.

I loved this recipe.  I used 1 can of chicken broth instead of water. Also used a can of Italian tomatoes for the tomato. It is fast and easy!  My husband couldn't beleive this didn't come from a restaurant.

This recipe was great! The only thing I changed was what other reviews have already mentioned.  I added a full can of chicken broth (instead of the bouillon and water for more flavor), a can of diced tomatoes (slightly drained) and we love lemon so I would add more lemon next time.  This would be great with breadsticks to soak up the juices!  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent! I think that I would think that 6 oz of cheese would do better than 4oz. But this is tasty and the tomatoes just explode with flavor!

Wasn't really impressed. I followed this exactly except used chicken broth in place of the water/buillon.  Not much flavor & there was a ton of thin liquid in the pan.  Wouldn't make this again.

Very easy for the excellent results.  I used a slotted spoon to serve the spinach tomato mixture over some orzo with the chicken to the side.  It is a great dish for the amount of time to prepare.  I added fresh black pepper to the orzo/spinach and sprinkled with more feta.

This was good! We used the juice on couscous. I did add more spinach because the juice looked a little sparse. (I don't even like spinach). This was my first time using a meat mallet and it didn't take that long to prepare. Very good!

Wonderful flavor, even my husband who does not really care for feta cheese loved this one. I found it easy to just get some boneless, skinless chicken breasts from the store, and there was no need to get out the meat mallet

Outstanding!  The only things I changed were to use tomato & basil feta cheese and little more spinach.  I also added a little lemon juice to the sauce and since it wasn't as thick as I wanted I added a little cornstarch.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was just okay for us.  I added more spinach than the recipe called for because I knew two cups would cook down to nothing.  I ended up adding lemon juice to mine just to give it more flavor.

Very easy to make.  I have made this recipe numerous times to rave reviews.  Once, in a hurry, I substituted stewed tomatoes and canned spinach and made a nice topping for the chicken.  I also like to garnish with pitted green olives, they go great with the feta!

This is so tasty plus it's low-fat, low calories, and low carbs!  I used a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomato and was very pleased with the results.  I highly recommend this recipe. Thanks for posting it Orisha!

WOW, I made this today and it was excellent. I did opt for a fat free chicken broth in a can instead of the bouillion. Served with grated parmesan cheese over top also. Very pleased with turnout!

This was very good but not over the top.  I loved the spinach, and feta cheese, but it was missing something.  If I made it again, I would add more garlic, and season the chicken more

Very yummy and very easy to make.  I wasn't in the mood for a tomato the night I tried it, so I left it out, and it tasted wonderful.  I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh (about 1 cup), and it worked fine.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I didn't think I would like the feta cheese, but tried it anyway and was surprised how well it tasted. I have made this recipe several times for my family and they LOVE it too.  Thanks for this great recipe.

My husband thought he didn't like feta cheese so it took me a while before I tried this on him.  He changed his mind about feta and we both thought it was great.  I used reduced fat feta cheese (to cut down on the fat) and Herb Ox (very low sodium) Instant Broth and Seasoning Chicken Bouillon.  It has only 5 mg. of sodium, no MSG added per package, and I use it any time broth or bouillon is called for in a recipe.  More spinach and tomato work well with this recipe.  I had some left over whole wheat pasta and I served it with the chicken. We look forward to having this wonderful dish again.

So good!!  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I substituted some sundried.  I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion and finished baking in the oven.  Easy enough for a weeknight meal and delicious and special enough for guests!

The feta and lemon made the dish a bit tart. Perhaps it'd be nicer with a flavored feta, to cut back on the acidity. Overall though it had a nice fresh flavor.

This recipe is excellent.  I now make it every week and have made it for guests who also love it.  Sometimes I add chopped mushrooms to the sauce and I often use fresh oregano instead of dry.

I thought this was awesome!  Didn't think it was bland at all.  I wish I had browned the chicken more before pouring the liquid into the pan.  The chicken ended up unappealingly white.  I used a can of chicken broth and put in extra spinach, as recommended; thanks for the suggestions.  I really like this recipe, because it's one of those that I can do again without really measuring ingredients so much.  Reasonably quick, flavorful, yummy.  Thanks!

Feta cheese, lemon juice and oregano is a great combo! This was great. I also jused a can of chicken broth instead of a bouillon cube.

Well I had planned on making this, but somehow I forgot to buy enough chicken... so I used pasta instead and it turned out wonderful anyway! Actually all I ended up using from the recipe was the olive oil, feta cheese, lemon juice, and oregano, and tossed it with Gemelli pasta. Thanks for the idea!! It was wonderful!!

Disappointing.   The chicken was good, and the sauce passable but the spinach was horrible and we love spinach at my house!  The gets filling was also not bad, but not worth the expense.  Maybe we got a bad box of spinach.

Made this for the two of us. My husband loved it. I did make some changes. I used canned  diced tomatoes strained them and saved the juice. Then I combined the tomato juice with chicken stock for the correct amount of liquid. I also added some mushrooms and onion to the spinach. My thanks to cousin Cosmo.

I Reduced the recipe to 6 servings, used frozen spinach, and followed the recipe as written. Really delicious. My husband doesn't like feta, but he did like this! Definitely a case of "the whole is better than the sum of its parts"!

This made for a nice dinner.  I did add a few additions to the original recipe.  I used more flour to coat the chicken well, with extra seasonings.  Instead of chicken bouillon and water, I used chicken broth, and added in some chopped onion and garlic to saute with the chicken.  Instead of adding the lemon juice into the cheese mixture, I squeezed half a lemon over top of the chicken and sauce at the end of cooking.  I think the lemon squeezed in the sauce at the end, really added a brightness to the dish.  Thank you for the recipe!

I am trying new things and I really enjoyed this recipe. I would just say to double the spinach and add it last minute so you don't over cook it and lose the nutrition. I had to increase the flour mixture. and I used skinless boneless thighs because that's what i had on hand, it actually wrapped perfectly instead of beating it flat. Otherwise, I'm note sure if it was me or the recipe but I found my gravy was really salty by the end. so next time I may use less of the bullion. Otherwise it was a great meal and I plan to cook it again.

This dish is wonderful and a great dish to serve company.  It looks wonderful on the plate and is easy to make.  I followed other reviews and did not pound out the chicken, but simply cut a pocket into the breast.  Allowing it to simmer a little longer does help the sauce thicken up.  I serve this with Greek Couscous (Israeli style) from this site and it is a wonderful meal.

Mmmm, good!  I added more spinach and doubled the sauce because I thought there wouldn't be enough but won't do that next time as there was plenty.  I also cut a pocket in the breasts and stuffed them whole to save time.  Really good flavors in this and love that it comes with its own side dish.  Quick and easy!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is AMAZING! I used chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water because that's what I had on hand. Very delicious just as is and the whole family loved it. Served with freshed sauteed green beans and homemade rosemary bread. YUM-O! I will defintely be making this again.

I added more spinach, but didn't change anything else.  I served it with brown rice because I had leftovers, but it would serve well with pasta or roasted potatoes.  Delicious!

Lovely recipe. 

I made changes as I always do - so no judgement on this original recipe, it was great. 

I used chicken stock, not a cube. I also added 1/4 cup of cream towards the end, just after thickening the sauce up a little with some plain flour in water. I prefer a thicker sauce, myself. 

And I used skin on, chicken thigh on the bone. Man, I hate chicken breast lol. I put the feta mix in between the skin and the meat, seared it all and threw the meat in the oven at 180C with half the sauce. What was left of the sauce, I thickened om the stove top with flour and added the cream to. Make sure you add the spinach at the very end so.its just wilted and still bright green. 

I also minced a red onion and 3 fresh garlic cloves and cooked in a little oil before adding all the sauce ingredients - and (last modification to this recipe lol) I threw in pine nuts, as another reviewer recommended. 

A restaurant quality dish. Thankyou for a lovely recipe! I served with roasted sweet potato, red capsicum, zuchinni and red onion alongside fresh home made dinner rolls. Everyone loved it.

I like this recipe.  As I always say,  "A recipe is a guideline with room for personal preferences".  :)
I did make changes because I do often listen to the reviewers opinions.  I cut pockets in the breasts, stuffed with feta mixture and then closed up with toothpicks.  Saved me some time. I added more lemon juice and more flour and some garlic & used chicken broth instead of water...and it was quite tasty and tender.  I simmered it as directed - I love those types of chicken dishes so I probably would not bake it (as some others have).  I served it on thin spaghetti (husband's request).   My husband loved this dish so that is good; I will definitely make it again. I am giving it 4 stars because I thought it needed a little more flavor somewhere, I will think on that because it doesn't need much... I am more of a baker than a cook and this was very easy for me! Always a good thing as I don't enjoy cooking much unless I am in the mood, which is rare...

This was a great recipe for a small, quick meal.  I did add red pepper flakes to the feta stuffing along with the sliced "pocket" method for stuffing some recommended. Beautiful presentation.  Thank you for sharing!

This is an awesome recipie!  I made it last night for the first time.  I tripled the spinach and added a sauteed diced onion and about a cup of sauteed sliced mushrooms.  In the end I made a slurry of a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce some more.  My boyfriend isn't particularly fond of chicken (He's a beef man) He enjoyed it too :D  It makes a very pretty presentation too.

Outstanding! I used a mixture of chicken broth with some white wine instead of the water and bouillon. I also waited until the last few minutes to add the spinach and tomatoes and i think it was much better that way.

This was very yummy, but made a few changes First, I used chicken tenders instead of the breast and added the feta mixture towards the end of cooking.  I added szechuan pepper and granulated garlic to the flour and added 2 extra tablespoons of flour to the chicken broth. I served it over minute rice and it turned out very good. Be careful to not add more than the recommended lemon juice or it will over power the feta.

This was a BIG hit at our house and we will be doing it again.  We served it with a Feta Couscous and both my girls had seconds.

Good recipe but does NOT need added salt.  In fact, I would use low sodium chicken broth r/t boullion.  The feta cheese adds plenty of saltiness to the broth.  
Otherwise excellent - add more spinach!

This was great. My husband and I loved it. The only thing we will change is the amount of lemon juice. We'll use a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice instead of a tablespoon. It had too strong a lemon taste and we like lemon so that wasn't the problem. This and the Mediterranean Chicken are 2 of our all time favorites!

Great quick and easy recipe. One I'm probably going to add to the regular playlist as it's so simple for doing right when I get home from work. One thing, as noted by others, is to add the spinach very late in the cooking and let it cook down for only a few minutes, to keep the fresh green color

My boyfriend and I made this last night.  Followed the recipe to the T and it was absoulutely delicious.  Will definately share with family/friends and will prepare over and over.  Took the advice of one of the reviewers and made some Cous Cous, which neither of us have ever had and they were great together.

It was a great recipe, and really easy to make. The time instructions for the stovetop are perfect. I was worried that it might be undercooked, but it was tender, juicy, and perfect.

Read one review that said Cosmo's chicken was better then a restaurant's and they were right. If you pound the chicken just right it covers very nicely and the feta stays in soooo nicely. LOVED IT. Was told by a friend it was better then other chicken she's eatten. :)

Loved this recipe!  I served it over a bed of couscous and it make a beautiful presentation.  The only change that I would make would be to add a little more tomato and spinach and some lemon juice to the broth as it cooks.  I will use this recipe over and over again.

Very tasty recipe.  The only thing I would change is the medium heat for browning the chicken.  The chicken wouldn't brown on med heat and by the time it got hot enough to brown, the cheese started melting and then there was too much liquid to brown it.  I messed up and accidently used half beef broth and half chicken broth.  Even though my meat didn't brown well and I used some beef broth, it was still delicious.  It got rave reviews from all of our company and even my toddlers.

The filling for the chicken was perfect!  Although like another reviewer, I almost ran out by the time I got to the last chicken breast. Next time I would use less broth than 1 1/2 C and thicken it with corn starch.  The sauce was very liquidy and I'd prefer it to be thicker.  I would also wilt the spinich and tomatoes with some of the broth in a separate frying plan and then spoon over the chicken instead of cooking it altogether.  Prep time took longer than stated as well as the chicken browning time (I had very fat chicken breasts).

My husband loved it!! I, too, browned garlic in the oil prior to browning the prepared chicken.  I also rolled the flattened chicken with the feta filling. It looked 'fancy' on the plate.  When serving I sprinkled a few cold chopped tomatoes and fresh spinach on top.  The contrast between the cold topping and hot dish was good.  Am serving this dish to a party of 6 in a few days.

I'm afraid that we were not fond of this.  The feta cheese was too sour and needed to be cut with something.  Maybe cream cheese.  Anyway, we won't be making this again.  Sorry.

I loved the flavor of this recipe but I found the stuffing/rolling the chicken to be a bit to tricky for myself since I'm just a beginner!  If I could figure out a way to stuff the chicken without it looking like a mess then i would definitely make again.

This was good.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used some Italian stewed canned tomatoes.  Smelled very tasty when cooking it as well.  It was very easy except pounding the chicken, I always get impatient when doing that.  I'd make it again though!

We really enjoyed this, but I question the cooking method. There was definately not enough flour mix to coat the chicken with before cooking & once I covered & simmered, all of the cheese melted out. Plus, it was just swimming in a huge amount of broth that really had no use??!! We really liked the flavor, just wish we could taste the cheese too!!

Nice, but not distinctive flavor.  Other than the feta, nothing really "popped", so that it mostly tasted like chicken w/ a bit of lemon.

Wonderful!  The only changes I would consider would be to increase the amount of vegetables, add the spinach shortly before the cooking is complete, and increase the amount of sauce.  I did find that I needed a little more flour to coat the chicken. I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you!

great dish very impressive for guests amazing flavor and easy enough for any night. I used bone in chicken breasts and stuffed filling under skin which crisps up very nice when pan fried. also very good with boneless skinless and healthier but i do perfer the bone and skin on for a treat.

Really good recipe that deviates a bit from the way I usually use up chicken breasts.  I added a little extra lemon to the chicken broth mixture and used some frozen spinach after realizing I didn't have fresh.  In the future, I'm going to cut pockets into the chicken and stuff it, rather than securing it with toothpicks.  I found using the left over flour in the broth didn't make much of a difference in the overall outcome and the sauce was still a little watery, so feel free to omit it, or use cornstarch if you're looking for a thicker sauce.  Definitely going to try this again.  Both my parents LOVED it.

This is a great dish.  We felt as if we were eating an entree at a restaurant.  Although I would advise that there needs to be more feta cheese and flour as prescribed.  I would reccommend at least twice as much.    This is one dish that you have to eat the same night because the next day, all the juices are gone.  Pasta goes great with it!

Amazing!  Simple, beautiful, definitely "company worthy".  Served over browned Israeli couscous with lemon on the side.  Next time I will use a little less feta to stuff the chicken breasts and add the spinach later as adding it when you add the liquid really kills it!  Still tastes great but I like mine a little less...mmm...dead. All in all...excellent!

This has become a family favorite and added to the regular menu rotation. I use white wine instead of chicken bouillon and water and add artichoke hearts and black olives. I finish it off in the oven for about 15-20 minutes. Then top with extra feta cheese. YUM

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.  My husband decided to give this recipe a try.  I was surprised since he hates feta cheese and spinach.  I loved it!!!  The chicken wasn't dry.  You can barely taste the feta (it's like it melts away into the dish) and each breast cooks in this amazing broth.  I'm not a big fan of cooked spinach but this was wonderful.  My 6yr-old wanted seconds!  I hope my husband makes this again.  Side note:  I ate mine over couscous and it was WONDERFUL!  Pour the liquid over and enjoy.  I could have eaten this for 3 or 4 meals straight.  Thank you so much for this great and easy recipe!

Fairly good. Found it lacking in flavor, even after I added garlic powder and greek seasoning to the flour. I even put extra feta and oregano. Its ok, but no one even said anything about during dinner. My family is very picky about "greek" food, and this one just didn't pass.

What an amazing recipe!  It took almost no time to make (and when I have to work late, that is a huge plus) and was a whole meal in itself!  I served it over parmesan couscous and I made quite a bit hoping for left overs to make my lunch tomorrow.  By the time I got finished eating my dinner, the pot was scraped clean.  My family told me that it was the best chicken they've ever had!  

I marinated the chicken in lemon, a touch of olive oil, salt and pepper and I cut the pockets into the chicken.  I skipped the bouillon cube and just used chicken broth.  It was so simple, so cheap, and so fresh tasting!

This recipe was AMAZING (to quote my husband and kids)!  I did change a few things, which I think added to the flavor, so here goes:
Added about 1 tsp of crushed garlic and a tablespoon of roasted red peppers to the cheese filling.  I also used crushed stuffing mix for the breading, instead of breadcrumbs.
I will make this again soon!

This was very tasty.  Next time I make it I plan on adding mushrooms to the sauce.  I think it would be a good addition.  I used fresh oregano (as I have it in the back yard) instead of dry.  I think it's better that way, and added a little more tomatoes.  Very good recipe!

This was very good.  My only problem with it was it seemed really salty.  The next time I make it I will probably try to cut down on the salt in whatever way possible.

Average Dish, Pretty salty, and just not as yum as I hoped it would be. However, my hubby loved it, so perhaps I will tweak it a little more and give it another shot in the future. Perhaps some fresh basil, full fat Feta will do the trick.

Not a memorable dish.  My husband cooked this (of the two of us, he's the one who enjoys cooking the most) and felt it was too much work.  Chicken and feta and spinach and tomatoes together sounded terrific, but it just wasn't as flavorful as we were expecting.

Good basic recipe. I used spinach, garlic, and crushed red pepper as well as the feta, lemon, and oregano for the stuffing. I browned the chicken and then baked them at 350 for 30min. Using the same skillet that I browned them in, I added flour, chicken stock, and garlic to make a quick sauce to put over the chicken, then sauteed spinach and tomatoes in the sauce. All served with lemon infused couscous made for a meal they raved about at the firehouse!

Easy, yummy, and healthy too! 
My mods: More spinach, a large heirloom tomato from the farmers market, and half the salt if using a bouillon.

I felt it might need a little more spice to make it 5 stars.  Only modification I made was to use chicken broth instead of bouillon.

My boyfriend says this is his new favorite meal, and his mom loved it. I've made it three times, twice following the recipe exactly and it came out great. I tried baking the chicken once but prefer the fried method.

This was good but didn't have any WOW factor.  It was really branching out for my husband's taste buds!  He was nervous when he saw it but enjoyed the meal.  I served it with coucous. I liked that it was made with nice, fresh ingredients.

Overall this was a great recipe! The other reviews really helped. I added more spinach, tomatoes and didn't flour the chicken breast. Turned out really yummy! I will make this again.

We really enjoyed this. I wish I'd pounded the chicken thinner though. If I were to make this again, I would add some garlic, and sliced olives for more variety of flavors. Good stuff though. Thanks, Orisha!

This was very tasty.  Even my seven year old who doesn't care for green things in his food liked this-- spinach and all.  To JimJeanne who couldn't understand how much flour to add-- the recipe clearly says 2 tablespoons flour divided (not one.  So use 1 tablespoon for dredging and 1 tablespoon for the sauce.  Delicious.

This was fabulous! We got our kids to try spinach with this dinner. I would add more spinach next time, as we like it a lot. The cheese stuffing and sauce were just perfect.

Good taste. I used real chicken broth (adding any leftover to the couscous), and added the spinach in the last couple minutes.

good dish.  nice flavor, not very strong though.  next time i will add spinach later to prevent ugly browning of leaves.  yes my friends, the sauce is thin, but that's how is s'posed to be.  spoon it over whatever starch you're serving it with.  or use "Jo's Rosemary Bread" from this site to sop up the extra.  yum!

This was tasty, but like many other reviewers, I felt the sauce never thickend up.  It would have been much better if it had.  Also, I felt that simmering the spinach and tomatoes for 10 minutes was longer then needed.  Perhaps 5 minutes would have been enough.
However, the taste, as long as you like feta cheese, was very good.  I may or may not try this again.  Not sure yet.
Oh, one other thing.  The recipe calls for 1 tbl of flour, divided.  In step one, it say's " combine 1 tbl spoon flour with....".  Then in step 3, it says, 'whisk together 1 1/2 cups water.....and remaining flour."  What remaining flour??  I already used the 1 tbl spoon called for.  I added another to the mix, but it still never thickend up.

Very good.  I did not have a meat mallet so I cut a pocket into each breast as others had suggested.  I think I'll go the extra next time, and buy a mallet - this would be better with thinner chicken.  Overall, very good taste.  Thank you for sharing!

The chicken was great!  The sauce was so-so.  Couldn't really taste the spinach or tomatoes but it did add nice color.  I didn't think that the 1/4 cup of feta cheese was enough so added some softened cream cheese to the mixture.  Also, much more flour is needed for the breading.  Will probably make this recipe again but with a few variations.

I only gave this 4 stars as it was a bit too lemony for my taste but Hubby and the cat both loved it.  I also used baby spinach leaves and used more than what recipe called for as we like it.  I also used chicken broth instead of the chicken bouillon cube and water called for in the recipe as other past reviewers suggested.  Very easy recipe to do and it does look fancy.

Cousin Cosmo's chicken is terrific. The best chicken dish I have made yet. I think next time I will use more flour mixture and more feta/oregano filler. Absolutely outstanding!!!

I followed suggestions and just used straight chicken broth.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes and more spinach to wilt on the top of the dish.  I also used 8 oz. of feta too.  I served this over jasmine rice and my spouse and I were both very happy with the dish.  I used blue toothpicks that left their mark and color but the dish was so good who cared.  The leftover juice was like a soup and quite a treat.  Thanks a lot!

I thought this dish was delicious.  My husband said I could easily make it for company.  I used more cheese than called for and added 1 clove of minced fresh garlic to the sauce as well as some oregano.  I also used chicken broth instead of the cube and water.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make again.

Made a couple small changes: cooked the chicken in the oven separate from the sauce,  added garlic to the sauce, used only half the lemon juice, and four chicken breasts. Served with couscous. Will definitely make again.

I was expecting a bit more based on the glowing reviews, but this is still a good dish. I added garlic and a little bit more lemon juice to the sauce, and that definitely kicked it up a notch. Served it with garlic bread and rice pilaf.

I used broth instead of boullian, this turned out really well.  I have frequent requests to repeat this recipe.

Very good and different. I used garlic and herb feta cheese and added some oregano to the sauce, but I still think the sauce needed something. will work on it some more.

I love to make this, and everyone who has sampled it has loved to eat it.  It was a little harder the first time, but now I don't even need the recipe, it's very easy.  
The chicken is just full of flavour. We eat this with rice and a big greek salad.

This was very different from any of our regular fare, probably a little too different.  It has a lot of flavor, and I can see how some people might really enjoy this dish.  We did not.  The watery spinach, chicken, and pungent cheese were a bit much for us.

Not bad. Has a light flavor considering the amount of feta in it.

Thought this was okay... I served this with rice and really enjoyed the sauce, spinach and tomatoes... and the chicken came out very tender. However, I wasn't too thrilled about the way the feta tasted... maybe it was the feta/lemon juice/oregano combination about it? If I make this again, I'll probably make it without the filling. Everything else about it was great.

This was a great dish that I will definitely make again. I used half a can of chicken broth instead of the bouillon.

This is a great recipe!  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I added extra seasoning to the feta to give it a little more flavour.  It makes excellent leftovers too.

My family loved this recipe. It tasted so wonderful and was so moist. The only thing I would do different is to add regular spinach leaves instead of baby spinach. That was my mistake. Thank you for the recipe.

This was an interesting and different taste to it.  It wasn't bad, although I think I would have liked it better if I didn't use lemon juice with the feta cheese.

Great Receipe. I added red bellpepper to the cheese mix. I also rolled the fillets and sauted them with leeks, onions and White wine.I also used fat free/low salt chicken broth rather than water and a boullion cube. Instead of adding flour to the chicken broth, I used Mexican Crema and a dash of white pepper. I halved grape tomatoes instead of the chopped tomatoe.

Delicious flavor and VERY easy to make! This recipe is very attractive to serve but DON'T cook the spinach. It will look much nicer if you just barely add the spinich before serving.

This recipe was delicious and light with just enough of a heavy flavor (the cheese) to balance it out.  I will definitely make this again.

This is really a good recipe. I used LOTS more spinach and cooked it on the top of the stove with the lid half way on, in order to get the chicken done well.

I only give this dish four stars because they dont offer four and a half.  Excellent taste, easy to cook.  My whole family loved it.  And believe me, when they don't like a dish, they tell the truth.
