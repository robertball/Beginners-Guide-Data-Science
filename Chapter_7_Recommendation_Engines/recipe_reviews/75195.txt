WOW!  These are truly amazing!!  We loved them!!  They are sooo tasty.  I was afraid the mustard and onions would be too much, but it wasn't.  I put in slightly less than 1 TBS. thyme, but I think the whole amount would have been fine.  Instead of doing these grilled-cheese style, I assembled them right on a cookie sheet (omitting butter completely) and baked in a 400 degree oven for 11 minutes.  This, to me, is easier, plus it cuts out unecessary calories and fat.  In addition to that, I used half light mayo and half regular.  I also used whole wheat bread.  These were so good!  Messy to eat, but well worth it.

Very tasty!  The only changes I made was in giving every family member their choice of cheese and "grilling" the sandwiches in the oven.  Placing the buttered sandwiches on a baking sheet in a 450 oven and baking for 8 minutes per side yields perfectly golden, crisp bread, melted cheese, and piping hot turkey and tomato.  Great basic recipe!  We'll try with other meats and cheeses soon.

DELICIOUS! Made these for lunch today with leftover turkey breast. OMG, these are out of this world! I just put these on plain sandwich bread and they were still amazing! The only thing that I would do differently is to cut down the Thyme a bit. These tasted like an expensive gourmet sandwich from a specialty shop. Thanks for the post, I will make these again and again!

Fantastic sandwiches!

I was looking for something tasty that could be made ahead of time.  So, I spread one side of the bread slices with the butter and grilled until golden.  I then assembled the sandwiches as directed, not grilling after assembly.  The result was a crisp buttery, crusty sandwich with a fresh, unique filling. They stayed crisp and tasty for several hours. 

I got rave after rave for these when I served them. I will definitely make them again.

(Remember to watch the temperature of these sandwiches if you plan to serve later, as the filling contains mayonnaise)

I cut this back to two servings (one each for my husband and I). I used whole wheat bread for both sandwiches and he added avocado to his. VERY good.

My husband and I both found the 1 Tbsp. of dried thyme to be a bit overpowering - I would suggest starting out with 1/2 Tbsp. and adjusting it from there according to your personal taste.  I actually think that if I try this sandwich again, I will either substitute dill for the thyme, or skip the recommended spread altogether and try a honey mustard.  It would also be good with some crisp bacon and avocado.

This sandwich is FABULOUS!  I love the bold, tangy flavor - and the recipe itself is very simple.  A great meal for the whole family!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Annie.

These have been a consistent hit with my family and friends. If you're going for a gourmet taste make sure to use a good mustard and a good artisan bread.

Great way to use leftover turkey!  I omitted the butter and just toasted the bread under the broiler.  All I added was lettuce and bacon and these were delicious with chips and a dill pickle on the side!

delicious sandwiches. We used leftovers from the "turkey stuffed with spinach" and that upped it to a 5-star, but with regular deli turkey It would be a 4. Super easy, will add it to the family favorites

Delicious - I almost didn't try it when I saw the calories and fat content. I used less of the mayo mixture on the sandwich and sprayed the outside of the sandwich with "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray.  Can't wait to try the spread on another sandwich at a later time. YUM!

I gave this 4 stars bc I modified it slightly. I made the sauce per the recipe- it was delicious. Instead of buttering and cooking in a skillet, I wrapped each sandwich tightly in aluminum foil and baked for about 20 minutes to warm and melt the cheese. I will definitely make these again the next time I have leftover turkey.

These are so good! The whole family loves them. We add less mayo and use only 1 slice of cheese (plenty IMO) and that cuts down on the fat some. I use a whole small red onion instead of bothering to measure it. I used to make it using thyme, but now I add 2 heaping tsp of Trader Joes 21 Seasoning Salute instead, and I don't use any tomato. Lastly, butter one side of the bread, put it in the skillet or on griddle, butter side down, and THEN spread with onion  mixture. Less messy that way!

Interesting, but messy.  I made a full recipe of the sauce without the thyme, then separated one-fourth, added the thyme to that, to try it out.  The sandwich was good, but messy.  I must have done something wrong.  My sandwich was toasted, the cheese was melted, but the turkey was not hot.  And everything slid all over the place while I was eating it.  I would like to try a thinly sliced red onion instead of putting chopped onion into the dressing.  Plus, I minced the onion.  Seemed to me that chopped would be a challenge to spread evenly.  I will try this again.

I could eat these sandwiches every week. I guess that means I'd have to roast a turkey every week. Hey, if that's what it takes. What I loved: the crispy bread and the melting cheese and that flavorful mayo and the ripe tomatoes and the sharp onion. This is a keeper. I'm going to try this with different cheeses, too. Brie? Havarti? Irish cheddar?

We enjoyed these sandwiches very much. Used only half the thyme and it was just right. Also used white American cheese instead of swiss. These were worth the extra effort.

I found these sandwiches to be really good.  Prepared them with Hungarian Mushroom Soup found on this site, I was admittedly nervous about the strength of the red onion being overpowering, but stuck to the measurements and found the spread to be tangy and a good match with the honey turkey I used.  I used a panini press for mine and kept them in the oven at 170 while I finished the soup.

An outstanding sandwich!  Even my picky husband liked it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 the thyme.  I used "real" turkey breast and put it on sourdough from Panera's.  I agree that you should use a specialty bread for this.  The sauce is ample for at least 8 sandwiches.  I might try it on asparagus!  It was SUPER!  I would recommend dicing the onions as small as possible and preparing the sauce ahead of time to let the flavors mellow!  A real keeper!

Delicious!  These were a huge hit for us, and they definitely have the taste of a bistro sandwich.  The sauce is exceptional -- follow the recipe to the letter, and do not cut back on the thyme.  For the bread, I used English toasting bread found in most grocery store bakeries.  It was perfect!  This is definitely a keeper.  It is excellent with any good soup.

These are really good. I cut the amount of thyme in half, and I'm glad I did because I think that otherwise, the flavor would have been too strong. Next time, I think I'll try rubbing roasted garlic on the toasted bread. Thanks Annie!

The sauce is delicious. I have now made these using different kinds of breads and cheeses but the best we have come across is to use panini bread on a grill. FANTASTIC.

Really really yummy! I made these for just my boyfriend and I, and used only 2 T. onion, and italian bread which tasted just fine. I cooked these on the georger foreman, and they grilled up nice and fast! I will make these again this week!

This was suprisingly good for such a simple recipe.  My guests seemed to really enjoy it.  I used Oatnut's 3-seed bread and used light mayo instead of regular and I only used HALF of the amount of mayo that the recipe called for.  This sandwich is like something you would order from a bistro :)

I totally agree with the reviewer who said this is like a gourmet sandwich!  Made them for dinner this evening and they were fantastic.  I've already e-mailed this recipe to several other people in my family.  I was also hesitant about the 1T. of thyme so I cut it down to half a tablespoon and I think it was more than enough.  Thanks for submitting Annie!

Truly incredible!  I also was afraid that the red onion (especially raw) would be too much, but this recipe is phenomenal! Two (messy) thumbs up!

One of the best sandwiches I have ever made! That spread just pulled all the flavors together and turned a regular grilled sandwich into a yummy but simple meal. I too was a bit doubtful about the 3/4 cup onion...but it is no way overpowering and simply enhances the all around flavor. Thanks Annie.

I only made one sandwich for myself for lunch.  I cut way back on the thyme using only a sprinkling.  I measured everything else because I wanted to add up the total fat since it didn't seem right that this would have such a high fat content.  I used 2 tsp mayo with one 1 tsp mustard.  Didn't have any fancy bread so I used plaine old grocery store whole wheat bread spreading the outsides with 1/2 tsp margarine each.  Used five slices of the thin deli cut turkey and only one slice of swiss cheese.  This sandwich was great and after checking all my labels I got a total of 18 grams of fat, which may not be ideal but is certainly better than nearing 60!

This had a wonderful flavor from the thyme and was tangy/spicy from the onion and mustard. I used onion powder, havarti, plain white bread, and added some bacon to ours. It was different and my hubby wasn't sure at first about the flavor but in the end he liked this. I loved it from first bite!

Yummy!  I loved the chopped onion in the spread!  I used an Italian seasoning instead of just thyme and that worked great!  Also used ciabatta bread which was super good with this!  ;)

This incredible sandwich is still settling in my stomach, as I just made it for lunch. I wanted something very fast and easy, but didn't feel like sitting down with another frozen dinner...then I came across these! I just used whatever I could find, so I ended up making the sandwich on Steak Rolls, using white onion, miracle whip, and dijon mustard along with the thyme. I also added some garlic powder to the spread, which was terrific. I didn't use any particular amounts of anything, instead just seasoning to taste. I also used provolone instead of Swiss cheese. I put the butter in my pan, as a steak roll is an odd shape to butter the outside of. I probably could have cooked it longer, my turkey was cold, but it left the tomato very fresh. This sandwich took about ten minutes to make the entire thing, and was DELICIOUS! I'll definitely make it again! :D

This was nice for a change of pace. I only had grape tomatoes so I got creative & chopped them & added them into the mayo/mustard mix. I spooned the mixture onto the first slice of bread, topped w/turkey, swiss, & the other slice of bread. They cooked up nicely & weren't mushy or too sloppy to eat!

The sandwich spread was delicious.  Really sets this apart from a regular sandwich. I used miracle whip (didn't have mayo on hand)and it gave it a nice zip.  Also used provolone instead of swiss. Followed advice of another reviewer and baked at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes, flipping once.

Very Yummy Sandwich!! My husband and I love panera so this was a sandwich just as good that we made at home! I did not have red onion so I used yellow onion and I didn't have french bread so I just used whole wheat and put in the oven just to warm it all up!

This sandwich was so YUMMY.  I did try a couple of different thing with it.  I used sourdough instead of french bread (because I couldnt find thin cut french bread)and I sliced avocados on top in place of the tomatoes.  The tomatoes where good but when I tried it with avocado--oh my goodness.  VERY GOOD!!  This one is going in the recipe box!

This is a delicious recipe.  It's a great way to enjoy turkey left over from Thanksgiving.  The recipe makes more sauce than is needed, so I either reduce it or save the extra to use later as a dipping sauce.  I've found that I like it better if I decrease the amount of thyme used so the thyme doesn't overpower the other flavors.

This received mixed reviews from my family...I really liked it so I gave it a 4 rather than a 3.  I used chicken instead of turkey because I had it on hand and thick multigrain bread.  And although I thought it was very tasty, my young kids just picked out the chicken (and they are generally pretty adventurous about food) and my husband wasn't thrilled with it (but he's a meat and potatoes type so his opinion doesn't really count).  I wonder if I had put the spread on just one side of the sandwich if the taste would have been more mild and therefore better received.  I will make it again for myself.  Thanks!

This was very good.  For a lighter version, toast the bread unbuttered, assemble the sandwiches and microwave till cheese melts.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent! I made it with the low carb wheat bread by natures own, and I used left over turkey from a previous meal, and it was soo soooo Good!! I cannot wait to try it with french, or Sourdough bread, and smoked turkey. It has to be out of this world if what I actually did fix was so good!

These were great!  My teenage daughters were watching me make these and had doubts, but after one bite they give them two big thumbs up.  Only change was using fresh thyme and whatever 'Brownberry' was on hand.

This was one of the best sandwhices I have had in a long time. The best part is that I made it and it is so easy to prepare and inexpensive. I was a little skeptical about all the onion. But the onion is just the right amount. I only used 1t thyme and I didn't have french rolls so I used hamburger buns. I can't wait to have this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Made exactly as is with the addition of 5 Part Salad Sprouts and Sunflower Sprouts. It tasted great. Used regular mayo for the kids since they aren't fans of mustard.

Yeah!  Awesome way to use some too-dry sliced turkey I bought. I only had powdered thyme, so I cut it down to a teaspoon.

These were pretty good; used deli turkey and made them on my electric griddle, using a loaf of ciabatta bread cut into four pieces with most of the soft insides scooped out. I think the thyme was a bit strong, and would use less next time. But really, except for the thyme, it's just a grilled turkey and cheese sandwich. Which is not a bad thing, but I think I'll stick with the turkey reubens I usually make. Thanks!

I cut this down to one sandwich because it was just me eating and I wanted somethind different.  I already had the turkey and swiss in my fridge.  This was SO good.  I am not a "thyme" person so I cut it in half.  It was perfect.  I also used country white thick sliced bread (what I had) and put it in the oven for a few minutes on each side.  I will definately be making this again!!

I found this recipe awesome.  The spread was so delicious.  I had only wheat bread and provelone cheese on hand, but the family raved about this .  I do think in would be 5 stars wsith the french bread.

Very yummy easy Friday night supper.  I didn't fry them off in a frying pan but wrapped the sandwiches in foil in baked them in the oven.

These were really good. I cut the recipe in half, but had enough ingredients to make 4 big sandwiches. I had to even put a toothpick in them to hold them together after they were done. I cut the amount of butter in half to, to 1 1/2 tblsp., and still found it to be plenty of cooking oil for 4 sandwiches. I also tried to lighten it up some by using low-fat mayo and lite swiss cheese. For the mustard I used dijon, because it is what I prefer. This was restaurant quality, in my opinion, even with dividing the ingredients among twice the amount of sandwiches. Thank you

Although I loved the sourdough bread, turkey, swiss combination, the sauce just wasn't for me.  When I used just the spicy mustard, I enjoyed the sandwich much more.

I like a tall sandwich as much as the next person, but this was the Eiffel Tower!  I followed the recipe to the letter, except for using rye bread instead of French.  I tried cooking all 4 in a huge wok-sized skillet, but had to throw 2 away, for lack of room.  How do you flip a sandwich that is so tall?   We had to eat them with a fork.  Still, it tasted good!

Oh my!!  I thought these were fantastic.  I had no idea I could make a sandwich like this.  I didnt change a thing.  All the ingredients and their amounts are perfect.  Thank you so much Annie for such an excellent tasting sandwich.  I have a feeling I will be making this often.

Delish.  I used oregano instead of thyme (all I had), light mayo, and SmartBalance instead of butter.  I used my panini press instead of the stove-top method with great results!

These were very tasty sandwiches.  I made a few modifications.  I used Sourdough Bread instead of French, and used deli spicey brown mustard.  I could not find mustard listed in the recipe.   Definitely a reciepe I will repeat!!

The dressing is SO good, I made some and put it in a bottle in my fridge! I added spicy brown mustard, light miracle whip, paparika, and some garlic powder. Then I took the suggestion to bake the sandwiches at 450 for 5 mins on each side. I used marinated, shredded chicken breast and provolone cheese. "The Mr." doesnt like hot sandwiches all that much, but he sure loved these! They're a snap to make with leftovers and would be sooo good with a nice bowl of soup, or even the chips we had! TRY THIS ONE! You WON'T regret it!

This sandwich was very good!  I had to substitute ranch dressing (recipe from AR) since I didn't have mayo.  I did mix it with the mustard.  I also had turkey breast left over from dinner earlier this week and used that instead of deli meat.  However, my turkey was cold when I made the sandwich so I had to cook on low heat and cover pan with a lid to get it heated through.  I will definately make again!

This recipe was just ok. Probably would've been better with leftover turkey.  But I think with some tweaking it can become a really nice turkey melt.  Overall a good base.

I made these for dinner last night and they turned out to be delicious!  I used ham instead of turkey because that's all I had in the fridge.  Next time I will cut back on the thyme and onion though because I thought they were both a little overpowering.  I will be making this one often with those changes.  Thanks for sharing!

WOW! My husband said this was the best sandwich he has ever tasted. It was so quick and easy to make. The best part of this sandwich is the mayo mixture it has so much flavor. I had extra so we used it on our boring sandwiches during the week. A new favorite.

This is one tasty sandwich! I did switch up a couple of things, though. Since I was afraid of that raw onion taste, I sauted them very lightly in a smidgen of butter, just to take the edge off. Also, I used provolone cheese instead of Swiss, as it was all we had. I used Hellman's Dijonnaise instead of the brown mustard, so I didn't have to use the mayo. Lastly, I cut the thyme in half and was glad I did because half was plenty. I think the full amount would have been too much. We grilled these up on thick sourdough Texas Toast. It was great! We definitely will be making this again!

This is a great sandwich, the dressing is a wonderful addition. I used low fat mayo and dijon mustard. I ate it with the tomato but ended up taking it off and liking it better. Will definitely make again, I am also going to try adding some roasted red peppers on it as well. i plan to have this for dinner again tonight.

The combination of flavors is unique and addictive, and the sauce is a winner (we used reduced fat mayo, and it was delicious). I used a loaf of Italian bread, which provided a nice soft/crusty contrast. My rather picky kids didn't like it, but children with more adventurous palates might.

What a easy and great recipe to jazz up a turkey sandwich.  Feed these to our harvest crew today and it will be a keeper.  I'll agree with the past reviews that the mayo mixture is alot.

KEEPER.  Didn't have the onions, so went with a dash of garlic. I've now made these with both turkey and ham.  Used plain "country style white bread" too.  Even my hubby who hands-down would pick a cold sandwich over grilled LOVED this, and I quote, "MMMM,tasty!"  He asked for one for dinner too.  :-) I know it's good.  He usually has a simple pallette and doesn't often request my "experiments" even if they are what the rest of the known world might call gourmet! lol

These were pretty good.  I think the amount of onion is a personal preference.  I thought that the onion was not overwhelming at all but my husband thought you could really taste the aftertaste of the onion.  Both of my kids enjoyed and they usually do not like onion or mustard.  Thanks Annie

I just made the sauce, and oh its delicious.  I used a half teaspoon of basil since I didn't have thyme.  One thing I'd like to note is I'm using fresh baked turkey breast.  Frozen turkey breast is less than two dollars a pound.  The deli turkey is like five dollars.  Just makes sense!  And the flavor of fresh baked REAL turkey is beyond compare.  Also, the broth is wonderful to make some homemade egg noodles.  Yum

These were great!  Pretty much made as written.  Used some marbled bread from bakery and used  Smoked Applewood bacon ground mustard in sauce.  So good.  Family loved, will definitely make them again.  Served with creamed tomato soup and dumplings.  Yum!

I scaled this to 1 serving and it was plenty of sandwich spread for 2 full sandwiches on regular sandwich bread.  I did not like the thyme, sorry, and I even used just a little bit less than called for.  The rest of the spread was great with nice proportions of each element and it really added a nice creamy, crunchy, flavorful kick to a basic sandwich.  This makes a BIG sandwich, one was almost too much for me.  I did not use 2 slices of tomato, but I thing you really need to just skip the recipe instructions for the amount of filling and use your eyes.  I think I ended up using 2 good slices of turkey and I did go with the 2 full slices of swiss to get it good and cheesy and to make a good barrier to keep the tomato from sogging up the bread.  I toasted it on a regular skillet with another skillet on top to weigh it down, and I made sure to really grill it a long time to get everything warm and gooey.  Next time I will make it without the thyme because it unfortunately just overpowered everything for my taste, but this is a good fancy grilled cheese and I bet the spread would go great with other fillings.

The perfect accompaniment for a soup and sandwich lunch!  I took the advice of another and baked the buttered sandwich on a cookie sheet in the oven, much easier for me than frying in a pan.

Great sandwich !!  Grilled on my sandwich press, then placed in the oven. The cheese and the sauce melted thru.  Served with the Butternut Squash soup by Maplebird on this site. Everyone gobbled these sandwiches up. Thx for a great recipe.

This was a very good sandwich! I didn't have any French bread on hand, but I did have a loaf of bread that I got from a local German bakery. I used ground thyme instead of dried thyme (there is a big difference) so I only used 1/3 of what was called for. The thyme adds a really nice flavor and really comes through after toasting the sandwich. I'm not big on warm slices of tomato so next time I may chop up some grape tomatoes and put it into the sandwich spread (as another reviewer suggested). This recipe is a keeper, thanks!

This was very good. However, I wish I had read the reviews that said to cut the amount of Thyme in half. The thyme was a bit overpowering. Other than that, they were very tasty. I did add cooked bacon to the sandwich as well (to give it more of a club sandwich appeal).  Delicious!

These are FANTASTIC. The only change I made was to cut down on the thyme, added cranberry sauce and cooked on my George Forman grill. They were very quickly devoured. Will make these often!

This sandwich was absolutely delicious! I used light mayo, Dijon mustard and omitted the tomato. The combination of flavors goes really well together. I will definitely make this again.

I loved these.  I made them all on my griddle so that they were all done at the same time.  I made 8 sammies and I still have sauce leftover.

Either way, this was an awesome recipe! Thanks!

These were just okay for my family by no means any fault of the recipe.  We learned that we do not like thyme :)  I will definitely make again sans the thyme and I'm going to try this w/ a honey mustard sauce instead of the brown mustard just because that's a personal preference.  Thanks for sharing a great base recipe that is easily adapted to personal tastes.

Very good.  Not that different from how I make my grilled cheese normally, but the spread is great.  I only used a minimal amount of mayo bc I don't really like it, and it was fine.  I do really like the thyme taste.  I served it on a triple seed whole wheat bread I made last week.  This is just a preference thing, but I wouldn't put as much turkey or cheese on next time.  I like minimal meat and cheese on my sandwiches.  Thanks!

to my surprise the onions are a bit overpowering in this sauce, still good but you have the spicy kick at the end, maybe less onions next time.

Great!  Word of advice though: You may want to spread the butter on the bread before the mayo/mustard/onion/thyme spread; I did the opposite and when I tried to kind of turn the bread over to get the other side the mayo spread practically all fell off, ha.  Really good though, quick too!

Delicious Friday night supper.  I used another recommendation and added alfalfa sprouts.  Also used whole grain bread and a pannini press.  Looking forward to making again with leftover sandwich spread.

I made these for dinner and they had a great flavor. I took the advice of previous reviewers and cooked them in the oven, 400 degrees for 11 minutes. I used a little less thyme as well. The French bread I used was a little too big for my 5 year old, although he did take apart the sandwich and still enjoy it. I plan to make this again, but I will change the type of bread.

Outstanding sammich!  I substituted a thin sliced italian boule for the french bread but otherwise followed your recipe to the letter.  I served these up to the family with stuffed mushrooms to rave reviews.  Quick and tasty!  Perma-posted in my recipe box.

This was surprisingly delicious!

I followed the recipe fairly closely yet I did substitute some ingredients. Tuscan bread, canola mayo, and spicy brown mustard. 

This is one of my new favorite recipes. I'm glad I still have plenty of extra sauce to make it again tomorrow.

This was really good, but to me, did not have the 'Tangy' taste I was craving.  The addition of the onions to the sauce made it more sweet than tangy.  Next time, I would leave those out and add a bit more mustard for my tastes.  My husband LOVED them as is.  They are very good, and very simple to make.

This was a great sandwich.Made as stated only 1/2'd  the recipe and left out tomatoes(I just simply don't like them)I thought this  fantastic.I did however use Schwebels light wheat bread as I'm trying to lose weight-so I do thing it would be better with a fancier bread(I am a card junkie and love my breads but am suffering through the light wheats haha)Will definately 
make again and recommend to all!!!

Easy and tasty.  Sauce makes the difference.  I used what I had on hand - vidalia onion, brown mustard and crusty french bread.

These were good but not as good as I expected.  I didn't add the onion...maybe that was why.  My husband didn't care for them.

So good!  This was a great, fresh sandwich with such simple ingredients.  For the mayo spread:  I used light mayo and used more mayo and less mustard than the recipe called for.  (Otherwise too strong of mustard, thyme, and onion taste for me).  I did not use as much of the mayo spread on each sandwich as recommended and saved the rest for later.  Definitely a keeper.

Oh this recipe is absolutely FANTASTIC!!  The only changes I made were using fat free miracle whip & fresh sun dried tomato bread from the bakery. I took these sandwiches to a social event, & 14 people (no exaggeration) requested the recipe!!! A definite keeper... you can't go wrong with these!

This was a really good sandwich! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I found the sandwiches to be quite messy to eat so grab some napkins. I cut the serving size down to 2 but was somehow able to make 4 servings. I cut down on the onions and my boyfriend felt there was too much onion & I have to agree. Next time I make it I'll only use 2 T onion (for 2 servings). Otherwise, its a terrific recipe.

Wasn't sure I really liked this sandwich at first, but found myself wanting another one the next day. It's gotten to the point where I crave them enough to make a special trip to the store for fresh turkey!  This sandwich is just delicious and I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.

So good and so easy to make.  The sauce makes the sandwich!  This will become a regular in my recipe rotation.
