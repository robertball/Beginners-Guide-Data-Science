this recipe is decent for a shopping list.  the first time i followed the recipe exactly, but the onions and garlic never broke down and melded with the other flavors.  the second time I sauteed the onions and garlic in the olive oil, adding the herbs and spices  one minute before removing from heat.   i also added some chicken broth to thin it down and some sugar to calm the acidity of the store-brand tomato paste i bought. the result was delicious!  three star recipe, five star results.

A great recipe for the slow cooker.  After reading some of the reviews, I too decided to cut down on the herbs.  Instead of using tablespoons, I used teaspoon measurements.  It was awesome and went well with the gnocchi that I used.  I think you need a heavy pasta to go with this sauce which turns out quite thick.  I may even scale down the amount of tomato paste the next time around.

Not good, the spinach, carrots, and mushrooms are a good idea however the recipe calls for too much tomato paste and not enough crushed tomatoes.  There was too much cracked red pepper and not enough garlic.  My mouth was on fire, next time I will try my own measurements with the ingredients.

What a good recipe!  I did cut the amounts of salt, pepper and garlic in half.  I layered it with lasagna noodles and cheese - the "hot spinach lasagna" was a hit.

This was a great sauce that I will definitely be making again.  I reduced the salt, oregano, and basil to 1 tbsp; the red pepper to 1/2 tbsp; and the tomato paste to 1 (12-oz) can.  It was very thick in my slow cooker and I had to add a little water.  I used this in place of the tomato sauce in the Tofu Parmigiana recipe on this website and also served it over penne pasta on the side.  My husband and I were disappointed when we ran out of leftovers the next day.

Some of the reviews weren't good, so I wasn't expecting much, but this was pretty tasty. I did, though, adjust the recipe based on suggestions. Didn't add salt, added less oregano, then fresh basil at the last hour of cooking. Just a sprinkling of crushed red pepper, but it still had a bite. Used only 1 can of tomato paste--plenty--in fact, next time, I might skip it and just add some tomato sauce. Was quite thick--I ate it on spaghetti, but I think it would work great in a spinach lasagne.

This was pretty good. I let out the Olive Oil, really didn't see a point to it. I let the sauce cook for about 3 hours on low, and then added 2 chicken breasts, and continued cooking for about 5 more hours on low.
The sauce was really really thick. Next time I think I will add a little white wine, and maybe some chicken stock to thin it out a little.
All in all though, nice and healthy and easy!

Excellent!  Everyone loved it.  Absolutely THE BEST marinara sauce I've ever had... BY FAR!  It was definitely worth the effort.

I used caution with the spices, figuring that you can always add, but you can't take away.  My sauce turned out delicious, but I went very easy on the spice: I added no salt, but I did sprinkle some garlic salt after it was plated, 1 T oregano, 1 T basil, and a dash of red pepper flakes (if I'd used 1 1/2 T as called for, I don' think it would be edible).  I trimmed down the olive oil, and sauteed the onions and garlic before putting it to simmer. I omitted the mushrooms. I reduced the tomato paste to just a few squeezes of the tubed paste. I used fresh kale instead of spinach.  I really like the carrots and greens in this sauce. Now that I think about it, I wonder if the recipe was supposed to be in teaspoons rather than tablespoons?

I took another reviewers suggestions and sauteed the vegetables in the EVOO. I did increase the carrot to a cup and I added about a cup of finely chopped zucchini. I also used fresh spinach, only because my family dosen't care for the texture/taste of frozen. We like our sauce a little thicker, so this was perfect for us. We had this over buttered hot thin whole wheat spaghetti tossed with parmesan cheese. We all inhaled it. This recipe is perfect for times like this, when you have an abundance of wonderful homegrown produce and items you can buy cheaply. Not a whole lot of money was put out, even to cook it! NOTE: If you have small kids like we do, set out the red pepper flake on the table to add for the big folks. If you add as much as the recipe calls for, you'll have unhappy kids.

I did not care for this recipe. It has way too much salt and herbs in it. Even too much olive oil. Cut down on the seasoning and the oil, and it is a decent recipe.

I like the idea of the spinach and other veggies in my sauce, but the herbs and spices are all wrong.  Everyone who commented mentioned the tomato paste overload, and they are correct.  I am going to try it again with 1/4 C red wine and am making appropriate adjustments to the herbs.  Any time I see 2 tbs SALT in a marinara, I am dubious!

This recipe just doesn't work with the given measurements of just about everything.   Too much tomato paste for sure and DEFINITELY too much crushed red pepper.  I only added one TBSP and it was way spicy.  Herbs were overboard as well.  It was a thick mess once cooked, so I added red wine, diced tomatoes, water, anything to thin it out.  This recipe has good "bones" so if you just use this as a guide and you are a skilled cook, you can make it work.  I would also cook on low for 4-6 hours only.

This is a great recipe BUT I think there has to be a misprint ... 2 1/2 TABLEspoons of red pepper flakes?? I only used 1 1/4 and our mouths were on fire...I will definitely try it again BUT with maybe 1/2  TSP of red pepper flakes so the flavor of the other ingredients have a chance to come out more ! ! !

We made it as to the directions with the only substitution being we used frozen chard instead of spinach. Cooked it in the slow cooker as directed. It was way, way too thick and the flavor was bitter to us. We used it for one meal and decided to throw out the very large amount of leftovers.

I LOVED this sauce!  I took the advice of others and changed the seasoning measurements to teaspoons.  And I omitted the paste and used tomato sauce instead.  Cooked on high for 3 hours...PERFECT!!!  Used as the sauce for lasagna.

I read the reviews and made some obvious changes. I agree 2 1/2 TABLESPOONS red pepper must be a typo. I didnt add any due to the 3 year old. I used one 12 oz can paste(what would I do with the leftover can?) I also added salt to taste at the end and sauted with just a little olive oil. I also added fresh mushrooms while sauteing. The carrots seemed an odd ingredient but I they basically disappear so I will do that again, anything to add more veg to the diet.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe. AND the result was the husband told me it was one of the best things I ever made !! and to share the recipe with my grown daughter, thats a first. Next time I will add a little red wine, some for me and some for the pot.  OH YEA, I sauted some skinned chicken thighs lightly then tucked it under the sauce for about 30 min.

This is so good for a change! Smelled so good when I came home from work. I added a 1/2 lb. of browned hamburger. I used a 28oz. can of diced tomatoes and crushed tomatoes and 1 6oz can of paste. Less salt and a sprinkling of sugar. This cooked all day on low. I mixed this with a box of cooked rigatoni. So good!

Excellent if you are cutting down on meat. The red pepper was too much for me so If hot is not your thing, add way less or just not add any.

I'm saying 5 stars with my minimal revisions.  I used a package of frozen spinach and DID NOT thaw or drain, just threw it in as it was.  I think that is what kept it from being too thick.  Also I only used 1 6oz can of tomato paste.  Also only added a sprinkling of S&P at the end of cooking.  It was so delicious.  My brother said it was better than store-bought!

Love this recipe.  I modify as follows:  - add 1.2 lbs ground turkey; brown with the onion and garlic - use 2 6 oz cans tomato paste - 1 15 oz can tomato sauce  - anywhere from 4.5 - 8 oz mushrooms  Leave everything else the same and it turns out fantastic

We did not like this.  I added boullion cubes with water instead of broth and it ended up being way too salty for my family.

Recipe states 2 1/2 Tablespoons crushed red pepper.  I added ONLY 2 Tablespoons and this turned out so hot (spicy) that it burned our tongues.  This is CLEARLY a mistake!!!!!Probably should have read 2 1/2 Teaspoons crush red pepper.  Proceed with CAUTION!!!!!!!

This was a great sauce.  It was too spicy for my family so I will cut back on the red pepper, but for me perfect.  The sauce was thick and it went a long way because of the hotness I used very little on a serving.  I will make again.

Great idea and starter recipe.  The spices and definitely red pepper need to be measured in teaspoons.  I omitted the tomatoe paste and added tomatoe sauce.  Added browned ground turkey and used as sauce for a lasagna.  It was great.

My family did not care for this recipe at all. It was extremely spicy, and I only used 1 teaspoon of the crushed red pepper flakes. Also, way too much tomato - I would cut the amount of tomato paste in half. Cooking this on "high" for 4 hours practically burned it and made the vegetables turn to mush. Reduce the setting on the crockpot to "medium" and add the spinach for the last two hours of cooking only.

Great recipe. I altered the spices to fit our own preferences and added a very tiny pinch of cinnamon. DH, who hates spinach, loved it but our boys who aren't normally finicky didn't care much for it and they normally love spicy things.

I don't know if it's good or bad.  The crushed red pepper (I only used a tbsp) made it so hot as to be uneatable. I'm going to try it again w/o any red pepper.

The recipe, as is, would probably rate about 2-3 stars, but with the changes I made, it was delicious! I made it with the following tweaks (based on what other reviewers recommended): I sauteed the onions and garlic in 1 T of EVOO, throwing in the oregano and basil the last minute or so of cooking - and didn't add any more olive oil to the sauce. I used half the amount of oregano, basil, salt, and crushed red pepper the original recipe called for, and only 2-6oz. cans of tomato paste. I also threw in about 1 cup of shredded zucchini and served it over spaghetti squash.  I got rave reviews from my wife and the 3 friends we had over for dinner.

My family loved this recipe!! When I made it I forgot it was for the crockpot so it simmered for a while. I thought it was very heavy on salt so I decreased that. I also sauteed the veggies (except spinach)before I added tomato. This was very thick so I added broth to it. Other than the minor changes it was amazing!! Definitely in out dinner rotations!

Honestly I would give this recipe no stars. I was a little worried with the thickness of the sauce when I turned it on and walked away. When I returned to the crock pot two hours later the whole thing was scorched and my kitchen smelled awful. I definitely think this needs water or some other liquid to loosen it and you should NOT cook it on high unless you won't it bbqed.

Very easy!  Great tasting!  I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1 Tsp, but it was still on the hot side for us - I'll use a little less next time.  Thick and hearty recipe for vegetarians.

Terrific. Four hours was a bit too long on high for my crock pot, so I will cook it a little less next time, but the taste was amazing. I served this over gnocchi, and it was a hit with my Sicilian husband.

This was very disappointing.  When following the recipe exact, it was incredibly too salty.  I had to add an extra can of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato sauce and it still was unsucessful.  We also added 3/4 cup sugar to attempt to kill the over powering crushed red pepper.  I had higher expectations, but this time this recipe wasn't for me.  Bummer!

Great, very spicy though.  I used 1 12 T of salt, oregano and basil and only 2 T of crushed red pepper.  It was too spicy for my son but it made exellent chicken parmesan.

This sauce was really good!  I added chopped green pepper, more mushrooms and tomato juice.  Next time I will use less spinach and less crushed red pepper; it was a little too spicy!!

It was awesome, prefect match between carrots and spinach.
I used to make spinach with beef. This is the first time I do it different and I think I will make it again.

I got discouraged after reading the reviews of this recipe but I really liked the idea of a veggie packed sauce and so with the help of other reviewers I tweaked this a bit and it came out pretty  good! I added the seasonings by taste and didn't even bother to measure but I can tell you I definitely didn't add anywhere near the amounts the recipe tells you to add. I also only added two cans of tomato paste and I added a full can of chicken broth (14.5 oz) . I didn't bother to drain the spinach either. Actually, I hardly even  waited for it to defrost. I cooked it for the recommended time and after 4 hours is when I noticed it was still too thick for my licking so I added the broth and then more seasonings as needed! Oh, and I used fresh mushrooms!

I've made this sauce more times than I can count: as is, with fresh spinach, fresh sliced mushrooms, added meat balls, ground chuck, sausage, and this time cut the seasoning to teaspoons rather than tablespoons, so added a 10 ounce can of hot Ro*Tel and a 14.5 ounce can of tomatoe sauce and a cup of red wine. Love the aroma this creates while cooking so I actually put the slow cooker on low and cook for 12-15 hours, overnight, because it is the best way to create the most flavorful sauce. Enjoy!
