Yum yum is all I have to say!!  I just added more garlic and a little wine as suggested.  I will be making this again!!  Didn't use onion powder or basil and used T of dry oregano.  Also used chicken broth instead of water.

This was great!  I reduced the beans to one can and threw in regular diced tomatoes, adding red pepper flakes to make it spicier (I can't find canned tomatoes with chilis).  I also used dried herbs to save money.  Used chicken broth as another reviewer suggested.  I did this in the slow cooker, and it turned out to be very, very tasty, with very little hassle!

This is delicious!  I made it for dinner tonight, and it was really really good.  I made a few changes:  I used frozen kale, defrosted it in water and then put it in.  I also used less Kale then what is called for.  I used one and a half cans of beans, and I washed them before I put them in.  I sauteed mushrooms with the onions.  I also put some Franks Hot Sauce in it, it gave it a nice tangy flavor.  When I put it in my bowl, I topped it with parmesan cheese and ate it with crusty sourdough bread.  Wonderful!

Oh my god this is so good!! I made it once without the onion powder then the 2nd time with it and found it to make a difference. Didn't have fresh oregano an parsley so I used dried and still tastes great. Kale is a great source of proteins and fiber as well as the beans. Also added some red pepper flakes like others suggested and the little kick was great! Totally recommend this for a good healthy dish!

Really tasty, but I added a lot of extras. 1 sliced carrot, 3 stalks sliced celery, a dash of red wine, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and some Cajun seasoning. And I changed out vegetable broth for the water. I served it on a bed of couscous. Very, very good! (PS--You can buy the can of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers at Aldi's)

I thought this was good, but I did find it a bit bland. I did add red pepper flakes, but I would try adding red wine next time as some reviewers suggested. I served it over pasta to make it a heartier meal, and it was a tad dry. If you want to put it over pasta I would suggest increasing the diced tomatoes. There were non-vegetarians at our meal who added sausage on top, and they seemed to enjoy the meal more. If you want to use up Kale, I strongly suggest the "Kale  Puttanesca" recipe from this site. Yum!

I was hoping the beans would give it enough substance to please a certain someone, but I ended up having to add some diced ham to entice him to eat it.  I would enjoy this as is, and will probably make for myself again - reheats nicely for lunch.

Very good!  My husband had never eated kale before, and he had seconds.  (I added a litte salsa to give it more flavor.)

We really enjoyed this.  I did have to increase the cumin, and like some other reviews suggested I added some red wine and crushed red pepper flakes.  The spicy pepper really complemented the dish well.  I served this over a simple onion and garlic quinoa pilaf for a healthy, clean meal.

Ok, so I didn't have most of the ingredients, but still the dish came out pretty good. I used canola oil instead of olive, garbanzo beans and garlic powder since I didn't have any cloves. I also had to use a metal pot instead of a deep pan. This is the kind of dish that you can experiment with different kinds of spices and vegetables, as long as you get the water and oil proportions right. I guess my only complaint is that it took an hour to cook, but the time is worth it in the end.

Good recipe, Not fantastic.  I love kale and make it quite often.  This is towards the bottom of my list of things to make again.  Sorry.

I made this Italian, leaving out the tomato/chiles, and cumin.  Sauteed a chopped onion with a cup of mushrooms, a diced small red bell pepper, a minced garlic clove in a tsp of veg. oil with the lid on to let them steam and reduce down, then added a 1/2 cup chicken broth, splash of white wine, 1 can of beans, a T. of Italian herb blend, 1/3 cup chopped dried tomatoes in oil and 1 chopped fresh Roma tomato and tossed with a whole plastic tub of baby kale.  This simmered covered while I boiled 1/2 cup WW elbow pasta, which I stirred in with a good splash of Sherry vinegar to brighten the flavors. Before serving I stirred in some fresh basil and drizzled some good olive oil on with just a little sprinkle of parmesan when serving.  It was such a good and satisfying vegetarian meal for two.  Thank you for the inspiration.

This soup was amazing.  I used garlic paste instead of minced garlic, real onions, added a can of green chiles since the can of diced tomatoes I had on hand did not come with them. Used vegetable broth instead of water.  I also put parmesan and shredded mild cheddar cheese before serving on top and served with garlic bread.  YUM. My husband was hungry and started serving it after an hour on the stove and it was not until after we ate it, I realized I did not do the last step with the beans, basil and oregano.  But it was really good anyway!

On it's own very good.  I thought the juices were a little weak so added 3 T. of sun dried tomato paste.  Also added 1 lb. of (venison) Italian sausage sliced 1/2".  Served this on top of angel hair pasta and it was a very satisfying and healthy dinner.  Will definitely make again!!!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but my husband and I found this to be very very bland.  I used chicken broth instead of water, as per other suggestions, wine, and even added extra Italian seasoning in addition to the recommended seasoning.  It wasn't -bad-, it just had very little flavor, even with the additions.  We won't be making this again.

Excellent introduction to kale. I added 1 cup of leftover barley and used 1/2 red bell pepper instead of canned chili peppers. My family polished off the whole thing! Next time I'll tweak it to cook the barley with the kale for extra flavor.

Excellent - the seasonings went very well together, it was easy to make and very healthy. My husband and I both loved this and will probably make many variations of it now.  I subbed butter beans for the cannellini beans and it was terrific that way!

Very tasty. I added some kielbasa and added a cup of chicken stock with the water to make it more soupy. Also used two cans of tomatoes and left out the basil since I didn't have any. I will defintely be making this again!

I loved this recipe.  I modified it a bit.  I sautéed shallots, garlic, red bell peeper, sun dried tomatoes with the oil, and spicy chicken sausage. Then I added white wine and cooked out the alcohol. The kale I used was a different kind of organic kale from Costco.  The leaves are smaller and it tastes like a cross between kale and mustard and collard greens. After that, I followed the recipe, but I added less water. It was delish to the 10th power.  I served it with quinoa...yummy.

This could become a regular dish for me.   I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for other ways to use kale (I have six overproducing plants in my garden this year).  Followed the recipe except I used ghee for olive oil, chicken stock instead of water (as suggested in other comments) and omitted the onion powder.  I also diced fresh tomatoes instead of using tomatoes from a can, and served over white rice.

Everyone loved it--I took it to a friend's house and not only my kids but theirs finished their plates.  Some asked for more!  It's hard to find healthy dishes that my teenagers will eat.   Plus my wife and I enjoyed it.  I'll definitely make this again.

Very good.  Left out the water as there was enough water in the canned tomatoes. Used parsley instead of basil (didn't have any).  Used 1 can of beans.

Delicious! Made some changes as recommended by others. I cut way back on the kale (my DH is not a fan) and used baby kale to cut the cooking time in half. Added about 1/4 cup of cooking sherry and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes with the onions and kale, cooking off the alcohol. Doubled the garlic. Dissolved a chicken bouillon in the 1 1/2 cup of hot water, then added it to pan. Finished as directed. Served with heated sourdough bread.

Alright dish... 1 hr of simmering was too much and there are a lot of beans compared to everything else.

The recipe says cook the kale an hour. Not sure why. I used kale in the bag and I only wilted it and only took 5 min or so.

I simply LOVED this recipe! I was looking for more tasty recipes to try with kale. I've also been looking for new recipes that are hearty and filling but without meat. This did the trick! I did add a few things...more garlic, a few teaspoons of lemon pepper, a few teaspoons of chili powder (I love a little kick in my dishes!) and increased the other spices called for in the ingredients just a tad! Sooo yummy. I even scrambled some eggs and added the left overs. AWESOME! Thanks for posting!

Delicious and healthy.  Even my meat-loving husband loved the dish and he doesn't normally care for kale.

I was satisfied with this recipe.  A vegetable bouillion "cube" was added for flavor as well as some leftover pork chop, chopped.  I used baby kale so it needed less cooking time.  The results were tasty over quinoa.  Thanks Stefanie.

I loved this one!  I used vidalia onion of choice, used already pre-cut/washed kale.....upped the cumin to about 2 teaspoons cause I love it....also added some chili powder...used dried oregano and basil since I had none fresh....and of course added some major hot red pepper chili flakes....good and healthy. Thanks!

I loved this, but the family was not interested.  You don't have to cook it for so long.  Cut out the heavy rib from the Kale.

A bit too coarse in texture...I ended up turning it into a kale and bean soup which was pretty awesome though.

terrific vegetarian dish. Very hearty. I made it without  the chili peppers (in tomatoes) and served it with a turn of good olive oil and some parmesan for a great Mediterranean taste.

Excellent unique dish.  My husband is not a fan of greens, but he really liked it.  We have plenty of leftovers and will add some sausage slices the next evening as others suggested.

Good not great.  Was a little bland -- had to add extra cumin.  Used chicken broth instead of water and tomatoes w/out green chile peppers because of my 3 yo.  This would be good with ham or sausage. I also topped it with parmesan cheese.

I have a mixed family of vegetarians and carnivores, so this is a perfect recipe that pleases everyone.  I add diced chicken for the meat eaters.  I also reduced to one can of beans, and threw in a handful of orzo to add a little more bulk and it was perfect.   My husband thinks vegetarian meals lack substance, but he loved this dish! It's hearty for a vegetable stew.

I really enjoyed this!  I used up a bunch of kale that had been sitting in my fridge for over a week and it was still very tasty.  Because I like things with a little kick I added red pepper flakes on top and it was great. I think it needs a little something to deepen the flavor a little.  Next time I make this I think I'll add a splash of red wine to the onions and kale and let it simmer down and add some fresh grated parm/romano on top at the end.
If you *must* have meat this would probably be good with some sliced Italian sausage.

This was excellent!  I didn't have enough kale so I added a zucchini too, at the same time the tomatoes and everything is added.  Also, I only had regular diced tomatoes, but happened to have a yellow bell pepper so I threw that in with the onions and kale.  The dish looked great and tasted awesome!

Yummy and easy.  Will definitely make again the next time I have kale.  There are so few recipes that use kale but not pork.  This recipe has a pleasant heat and really calls out for bread.

I liked this a lot, my boyfriend wasn’t crazy about it. We’ve been eating  vegetarian dishes in the evening so I thought this would be a hit. We made it according to instructions. The only thing is I had to substitute was Navy beans instead of cannellini because the market didn’t have any. I also reduced the cooking time by 30 minutes because we were hungry. He added Parmesan cheese on top and was pleased, but not thrilled. I thought it was good.

This is so good with some changes. I put beef stew meat, 4 cups of water and beef bouillon cubes (or beef broth in can would work)  in a slow cooker on low for 5 hours. I completed step on and added beef stew meat mixture to the stock pot in step 2. I added 1 can of mild rotel (tomatoes and green chilies) and one large can of whole tomatoes. I only used 1can of beans and added extra minced garlic. I used dried herbs instead of fresh because that’s what i had on hand. This recipe will be on rotation regularly in my house.

I used my Instant Pot for this recipe. I put the seasonings in first, for no particular reason; and once it sank in that this recipe called for a full teaspoon of onion powder, I decided to forgo the fresh onion. I'm glad I did. I wish I had used about half as much kale, and I wish I'd used chicken stock in place of the water. I might play with this recipe a bit, but it was only "okay" for me as written.

I made this about a week and half ago and it was a great hit (my husband adored it), so I'm making it again for a party. Made some changes as usual. Didn't have the beans asked for so I did one can black, one can pinto, and one can garbanzo which was suburb. No green chilies so I compensated with a lot of cayenne for that punch. Simmered it in the crock pot for a few hours and just delish! We also served it over a wild rice medley for more of a chili dish than a soup. When we packed the left overs away over rice the next day all the flavors had really mixed together and matured. Great recipe base and I intend to use it a lot!

My wife and I think this is a delicious dish and will certainly make it again, although I swayed from the recipe without trying it as directed.  I only had one can of cannelinis, so I substituted a can of black beans which made a nice color addition.  We love garlic, so I doubled the amount.  I also added 50% more basil and oregano than the recipe calls for.  I did not add the water, but relied on the juice from the canned diced tomatoes.  I diced two medium jalapeños because the canned tomatoes I had on hand didn't include chilis.  I tossed in about a half teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes, too.    I added about a half cup of cooking sherry, as well.

This was amazing! The only changes I made was that I threw in a  small parmesan rind while simmering and finished with a spray of EVOO  from my Misto. The spices were spot on delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used pinto beans instead of cannellini because that's what I had on hand and added sweet sausage. My favorite soup so far!!!!!

Awesome. I added a few things, which included 3 cloves garlic, Lacinto kale mixed with regular kale, 2 tsp of curry, diced fresh tomatoes with flaked, hot red pepper, vegetable broth, lemon oil & juice. I simmered it in an electric pressure cooker, stirring frequently until kale was reduced & wilted. I then put the pressure cooker settings on high & cooked for 3 more minutes. This was served at a family get together with few kale fans. They couldn't get enough!

I've got kale like crazy in my garden! This is one of the better things I have found to do with it.  I did add the splash of red wine, pinch of chili flakes, and cooked with chicken broth rather than water. My spices were dried and I added rosemary (which I will probably leave out next time). I've eaten it on garlic toast (YUM!) and over brown rice. Very filling and healthy! Thanks for the recipe!

This is now  my  dish-to -pass  as well as a huge family favorite!  I use cinnamon and chili powder in place of the cumin, add more cans of tomatoes, more water, and add orzo  (uncooked),too.

We enjoyed this. Used Roma tomatoes instead of canned and jalapeños rather than green chile. An excellent recipe.

Who knew that something so healthy could be so good.  But it did need more spices.

I made this for my husband's dinner last night and he raved over it. He said it was spicy and very delicious....definitely a keeper! I followed the recipe exactly except the oregano and basil was dry, didn't have fresh on hand.

Pretty Bland. I only added the one can of beans like other people have suggested. I also used chicken broth (instead of water, roasted tomatoes and red pepper flakes. It was too soupy/watery to serve over pasta. So I stirred in some cooked Iraeli coucous (the large size coucous) and ate it with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. Reminded me of minestrone soup. It was better the next day.

I made some changes: I used only one can of cannellini beans, which seemed like just the right amount. I also used one can of plain peeled tomatoes, and added some red pepper flakes, and I squeezed some fresh lemon juice onto everything just before eating, which was a nice touch. This is an easy recipe to make and quite tasty and healthy.

An awesome dish!  We used chicken broth and a little white wine.  Also used fire-roasted tomatoes and substituted shallots for onions.  Skipped the croutons (will try that some other time) and served over whole wheat angel hair pasta.  A little parmesan on top was a nice addition.  It was a filling and delicious meal.  I will make this often.

I only had half the kale, so I halved all ingredients except the can of tomatoes (I just didn't want to figure out what to do with another half a can of tomatoes). I also used a whole can of diced chilies since my tomatoes did not have them. Used dry oregano and basil, so I put those in with the other seasonings in the beginning instead of the end of cooking. Other than that kept to the recipe. I really like this! Great combo of flavors. Served with a tuna melt and made for a great and healthy meal.

This was really tasty, and much more hearty than you'd expect.  I'll certainly make this again.

Great recipe!  I added a couple of diced potatoes, and served it with a rotisseried pork roast.
