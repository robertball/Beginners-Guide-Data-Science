Very good! All it needed was a sprinkling of sea salt at the end...tasty! I would make these again. Thanks for sharing. :)

These were ok. I made them exactly as written.  A bit bland but a great idea on how to grill avocados! Next time I may add a pinch of salt and some fresh lime juice.

Not a fan of spicy, I used a Chipotle Lime seasoning made by Wildtree. It was great! Thanks for the simple and delicious idea!

Good on the grill. The avocados I had didn't have a lot of flavor. Next time I will try the Hass  Avocados. I favored them with Old Bay Spice & Garlic salt.

We found these fairly bland, but I like the basis.   When I try again, I will slice, and season the slices individually to get a bit more flavor.   I think Cajun would be good on this.
