I made this and another similar ceviche last night and while both were good, I definitely preferred this one. The orange and the hot sauce gave it a lot more flavor. The one thing I did not like better was the amount of ketchup in this one. It was just a little too sweet. Next time I'd cut the ketchup in half and replace it  with more hot sauce. Overall good recipe and one that would be perfect on a hot summer day.
