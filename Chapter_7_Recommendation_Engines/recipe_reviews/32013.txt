I usesd just the sauce with homemade crust (Jay's Pizza Crust, also from this site), and it was THE BOMB!!!! I can not say enough how this absolutely made my pizza delicious rather than just good.  The only thing I changed was I tasted the sauce as it was simmering, and I added about another teaspoon of dried parsley, another teaspoon of dried basil, and about a tablespoon just of Italian seasonings blend, otherwise the sauce was too tomato-y.  It also made A LOT of sauce-next time I'll probably just use the 28oz can of tomato puree but all the extra seasonings.

I already have my own recipe for pizza dough that has never failed me, but yesterday I had no pizza sauce on hand so I found this recipe.  Am I ever glad I did - the sauce tastes incredible!  It has just the right mix of tomato flavour and sweetness, and using whole tomatoes and chopped onions adds a lot of chunkiness to it.  It makes a LOT of sauce too; I'm going to freeze the leftover sauce, and it will probably be enough to last me for the next few months (although I may want to make pizza more often now, so maybe it won't last quite that long!).

Thanks very much for an excellent recipe.

I gave this no stars b/c I only used the sauce recipe.  It turned out just o.k., I think it needed something.  I increased the seasonings, like others mentioned and added a teaspoon of sugar to help with the bitterness, but it still wasn't impressive.  I will be trying the dough recipe next time thoughâ€¦thanks anyway.

Hmmm can you substitute the flat beer with something non alcoholic, or cn it be made without? I don't have any alcohol, and Im not fond of it.

This was excellent! we really enjoyed making this from scatch and simply topped it with mozz, tomatoes and fresh basil. Even though it takes a while - it's much better than frozen pizza. In fact, there's no comparison.

I just used the sauce from this recipe.  It turned out great!!! I don't like chunks in my sauce so I put the tomatoes in the blender before I started.  I think I will play with the spices a little next time but it was great!!! Thanks for a great pizza sauce that I can make myself and don't have to worry about what is in it.

Good basic crust. The only problem with this recipe is that you need more water. It was way too dry after following all the recipe so I added a little more water and a little more olive oil and it turned out great! I made this twice; once with bread flour, and the other time with half bread flour and half whole wheat flour, I liked it better with half wheat flour. 

I did not make the sauce, I have my own methods for that that I feel are better than what this recipe calls for. But the crust was pretty darn good!

Didn't make the dough (used "Ricardo's Pizza Crust" recipe) as we didn't have any flat beer - tbh we never have any left over beer in! The sauce was simple and easy to make with the ingredients I have in. Used dried oregano and less tomato puree (about 2 tablespoons. Blended it to give it a smooth texture which we prefer and used the leftovers (as half the recipe made too much for one pizza) for the base of a pasta sauce the next day. Yummy!

I used only the pizza sauce recipe, but it was wonderful!!  Very easy, quick, and flavorful!  Much better and just as easy as any sauce you can buy.  This is now my new favorite and made my pizza taste delicious!!

I used just the dough recipe because I already had home made pasta sauce left over from a previous dinner.  This dough is awesome.  My family adored it!!

I already have a dough recipe I like, so I didn't make this one... But this sauce!  Super!  I doubled the recipe and froze packages of it for later use.  I not only make regular pizzas for dinner, but also mini pizzas for my teenaged grandson and his friends for snacking.  They like to dip hot or warm pizza in additional (cold) sauce, and they have also given this recipe 5 stars!  You can't get any better praise than that.  These kids are experts in pizza tasting!

The best tasting pizza crust! I already have a sauce I like, but was still hunting for the best crust recipe. This is it! The others I have tried were ok, but sort of bready/bland. The beer MUST be the key! Dont substitute another liquid. 
Be sure to cook on a preheated pizza stone at around 500 degrees for a good crust. Crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. YUM!

My review is for the pizza sauce only; I used a gluten-free Udi's pre-made pizza crust.

I had to make minor adjustments to the sauce recipe due to lack of available ingredients, but it still turned out fantastic. Although, if I had the fresh ingredients on-hand, they would have been my preference.

I used about 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp minced garlic, no fresh garlic.
 
My can of tomatoes was only a 14.5 oz can, and then I chopped 1 1/2 large fresh tomatoes with juice.
 
My tomato paste can was an 8 oz., I used only one. 

I used 1/2 tsp basil seasoning, instead of fresh basil; as well as 1/2 tsp oregano seasoning, instead of fresh oregano. 

Additionally, I used 1 TBSP of pizza seasoning blend.

This made quite a bit of sauce. I have enough left over sauce to make an additional pizza, plus a single serving size of sauce to eat with pasta.

*Toppings: Orange bell pepper slices, thin sliced fresh tomato, pepperoni, fresh grated mozzarella, packaged grated cheddar, parmesan cheese, and fresh chopped parsley.

I made both the sauce and the dough. I LOVED the dough, but I wasn't crazy about the sauce. I love what the beer did for the crust. For the sauce, the recipe made a bit more than I needed for two large pizzas, and the flavor was bland but it still overpowered the flavor of the crust. It's a great consistency for sauce, though!

Simple dough to make. I started it in the morning and put it in the fridge till dinner(not overnight). I used whole wheat flour and it turned out great. The first pizza dough puffed up really high while in the oven and I needed to cook it longer so I rolled out the second one much THINNER and it was perfect. Lightly crisp on the bottom. The herbs in the dough make this recipe stand out from all the rest. My family commented on how good it was all night. As for the sauce,I didn't have fresh herbs but even with dried herbs this one is a hit and I will definately make it again. I appriciate the fact that I can make extra and freeze it for a quick meal another day.

I made the crust last night. Oh my goodness! It smelled so good and tasted just as good. I made a calzone last night and plan to make bread sticks with the left over dough tonight. I can't wait!

I made both recipes yesterday and baked my pizza today. The pizza sauce was out of this world! My friends had a piece and wanted to know if the recipe came from Italy.

The dough was tasty and crunchy the way I liked it. I made two very large pizza using this recipe!

thank you so much for sharing.

The spices made this dough taste wonderful.  Rather than making pizza out of this, I rolled the risen dough into nugget shapes then fried them.  They tasted just like the Beer Nuggets I ate growing up.

I only made the dough for this, mostly because I wanted bread, not pizza at the time I made this.  I used beer and onions I had used to boil smoked sausage and really didn't want to throw it away, so used it in this.  It made for some nice flavor.  I had twice as much liquid as called for, so I doubled the recipe and made a loaf of bread, a bunch of rolls, and a cheesy pesto bread that I put bacon on one half.  Hubs seemed to enjoy it; I really like the flavor in this dough.  It's pretty easy and basic; all the extra ingredients are just the herbs and spices.  Thanks for the recipe!

This totally bombed for us :( I almost rated it a two star... something I have never done before!  The sauce is better in than the crust, but even still I had to pretty much double the spices and add salt to get it tasting better (I NEVER add salt, I usually try to lower the sodium!) It still was off so I looked at other recipes and noticed they typically had some sugar added so I added maybe 1 Tbl of brown sugar. In the end the sauce was good. The dough. Ughhh. So bad! So dense it was like a brick! I thought it might have been bad yeast, but we did a taste test with another recipe and that raised properly... I don't know, I followed the recipe and it just never did raise properly.

Used the bread maker. Just through it all in. Made the crust and baked the pizza right away. Great texture and taste for the crust. It was crispy on the outside, chewy inside. The bottom got nice and crisp which made it easy to eat by hand without it flopping over. I baked at 450 degrees for 15 min. Just used can pizza sauce to save time. Had leftovers warmed in the toaster oven and was really impressed that crust was still crunchy, even the bottom. As good as restaurant crust.

This is the best dough recipe I've found. I used I.P.A. the first time but I've found a Porter or a Stout gives the dough the best flavor. Try different beers to find the flavor you like. Using a pizza stone try 3/4 cup of Sourdough Starter and your favorite beer for a light, crispy, flavorful crust.

I only made the sauce for a stromboli.  It was so good!  I used canned diced tomatoes and dried spices, but it came out great.

By far the best pizza dough recipe I have found.  The beer gives it a great flavor.  I have found that I can make this the same day, as long as I let in rise in the fridge at least an hour, although, always better after having a whole day in the fridge.  We like our pizza w/ just olive oil, so I did not try the sauce.

Good but not outstanding. The dough was a little dry, I added a bit more water. I made the dough with my Kitchen Aid from beginning to end. Really made the process easier. We ate it all, there were no leftovers. I made a plain pepperoni with mozzerella as that's my kids' favorite. It's all about the kids. ;)

I made the dough recipe the other night for a group of co-workers.  Because I wanted something that cut down on my time in the kitchen, I used this dough recipe.  This recipe is absolutely wonderful and a good use for leftover flat beer.  I highly recommend it.

Really good pizza crust.  Doubled recipe for two pizzas and its very thick and doughy.  Next time I'll make one and spread them thinner.  Really liked the dried herbs in the crust.  Had to bake it a little longer - 5-7 min?  Could be my oven.  Used another sauce recipe, will try this one sometime. -Finally tried sauce with Pizza dough I recipe. It is excellent!  I halved the recipe (Keeping original onion and garlic amounts ;} after reading reviews and I still have lots leftover after making 2 pizzas! This sauce is a keeper! Still looking for an easy, great dough.

I only made the sauce, which was very good and easy to make, but just not flavorful enough for me.  I did add a few extra ingredients (Some extra basil, parsley and pizza seasoning) but it was missing the wow factor.  Will make this again, but will also keep searching for a better sauce.

I followed the recipe using all purpose flour and everyone in my family loved this crust!  My 6 and 4 years olds had fun helping make it, and loved to eat it too!  The texture and flavor were great!

The Italian seasoning in the dough was overpowering.  I also could never get the dough to rise properly even after putting in a much warmer place and adding more yeast.  I thought my yeast may have gotten old but that was not the case.

I made only the sauce, and paired it with "Pizza Dough I" submitted by Gudny Bjorg Kjaerbo.  I needed something fast.  :)  Anyway, this recipe made plenty of very nicely seasoned sauce!  It spread easily and evenly, and rivaled our favorite pizza parlor's sauce!  It's a keeper!  Maybe next time I'll have time to try the dough, as well.

I only made the dough, but it was awesome! I made my own garlic sauce to go with it and both my husband and his friend say it was the best pizza they ever had, and at home to boot. It was easy to make, and I didn't let it sit in the fridge over night, just started it in the morning and it was good to go for dinner. I also used the whole batch to make one large 16" pizza instead of two smaller thin crust pizzas. Next time I'll make a double batch so we can have garlic bread to go with it.

I made this sauce, but could not find canned roma tomato's, so I used diced tomato's with onions and peppers.  It turned out great.  I used a box pizza dough, but next time will try the real thing.  I grilled my dough, turned it added the sauce, then some sliced tomato's, brown sugar and butter saute onions, parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese,blue cheese and Kalamata olives.  It was great, my fiance said it was the best pizza he had ever had!

I didn't make the dough, just tried the sauce.  Instead of a can of whole tomatoes I used a can of already crushed tomatoes with basil.  I also only used one can of paste as it seemed a little too tomato-ey to me.  Added a bit more garlic and a little salt and it seemed to have much more flavor.  All in all a nice base sauce to play with to suit your tastes.

Very good! We have gotten on a homemade pizza craze here. I did not make the sauce for this, as my 8yo does not like red sauce. I made a cheese bread. Thanks for the yummy post! We enjoyed!

This sauce was fantastic. I can't wait to see how it tastes when the flavors have a chance to marinate over the next few days. I did add 1t. of sugar to cut some of the acid from the tomatoes.  - Just something I normally do. I cannot speak for the dough. I  used another recipe from Allrecipes.com ( Grill Dough  - which was great).  I didn't use this one because I didn't want to wait on flat beer, I needed immediate dough.

This sauce and the crust is the BEST!  I don't care about take out pizza anymore.  I made no modifications except one time I used fresh/frozen tomatoes.  It is great!  I have made this at least 4 times already.

Yum. I made both. I realized after the fact that I didn't have the beer. So, I added more water and oil until it was the appropriate dough like consistency. I can't wait to try it with the beer though.  The sauce- I had diced tomatoes on hand and only 1 small can of paste. DH did not put sauce through food processor like I said so it was chunky sauce. It still tasted great, but hard to spread. Oh, and I added a handful of brown sugar- we like it a bit sweet. Will do again and again.

I just joined allrecipes last month, but I have made this pizza sauce for 5 years.  Today I realized that I printed this recipe off this site 5 years ago and now I have found it here and now have it filed in my allrecipe's recipe box.  My husband already makes a fab dough, and this sauce (with minor additions of italian seasonings, more parsley and basil) is a weekend dinner we look forward to each week.  Definite 5-star sauce!

The sauce recipe was GREAT!!! I did add some italian seasoning, about a tablespoon, and used more garlic. This is a perfect sauce for my pizzas. I will use it over and over.

We really enjoy this sauce. It's our staple recipe for Sunday night pizza. I make a double batch and can it into pint jars. Each pint is just enough for one Boboli crust.

I did not make the dough part of this recipe but I did make the sauce and it is great! When adding 2 cans of tomato paste I used one regular and one was a basil, oregano and garlic.  I also put the canned tomatoes in my chopper because my kids did not want the chunks of tomato.  I could not find canned roma tomatoes so I just used canned peeled tomatoes.  I think that even if I had not changed anything, this pizza sauce recipe is a great one!  I will use this sauce recipe from now on!

Very Nice taste. A little thick, but I added a little water to it and it was great.
