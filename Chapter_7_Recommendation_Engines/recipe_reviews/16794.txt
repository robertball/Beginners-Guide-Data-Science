This was the most awesome chicken pot pie ever!!! I used a whole onion and an 8 oz. container of sliced mushrooms from the produce aisle...I also used cream of chicken and cream of celery....that's what I had on hand.  I also used fat free cheeses and 98% fat free soups and just added 1/2 cup skim milk.  I bought 2 Pillsbury pie crusts and used all but one half of one to make the crust in a 9x13 casserole dish....I used the extra pastry to make flower embellishments on the crust. Will definitely make this again!!! Make sure and brush your crust with an egg wash to get it nice and golden and crunchy!!

This is one of my familys fave`s! I modify the recipe a bit by using a casserole dish to layer my chopped chicken on bottom,then I add my veggies etc. on top of that and the cheese is on top of that.I make a crust for the top by using 2 cups of self-rising flour,a stick of butter(real buuter) and chicken broth to make a batter that I pour on top and bake til brown.This is moist and delicious!

Excellent recipe!  I made it last night and my husband and I loved it.  I've never made chicken pot pie before, so I was a little worried, but I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  My husband even took the leftovers to work today for some of his coworkers to try!  Thanks Angie!

At first glance i thought this would be a fantastic recipe. But after i made it for my family.... not so good. The inside of the pie was too runny, it did not thicken up at all. If i make it again i will definately use less soup or more chicken. The mushrooms also didnt help with the runny appearance, as they cook they tend to make excess liquid. And i will be sure to use other suggestions and use fresh vegies. The frozen made the pie taste really bland. Just not tast enough for my family.

Ohh sooo good!!  I prefer to make individual pot pies so I prepared everything as shown except I used Grands Flaky Crust Biscuits and lined the top and bottom of individual corning ware bowls, cooked for about 26 min.  The crust was golden and flaky, the filling was hot and cheesy, my husband went back for seconds!!

Oh, this is just FABULOUS!! I used a sheet of pie crust for the bottom, and a sheet of puff pastry dough for the top, which I sprinkled with a little Parmesan and nutmeg. I added a splash of dry white wine to the filling as well. And I used a can of Vegall instead of frozen veggies. Just downright sinfully yummy!

This was a great recipe that helped me please over 70 people at my church!  A quick suggestion, you can Pilsbury Crescent dough for your pastry dough. (available in bulk at wholesale stores)

I had never made a pot pie before, but this was so easy!!! I made a few variations (like almost everyone does). I didn't have cream of chicken or mushroom soup on hand so I used 1 can of Campbell's Chicken gravy and 1 can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese instead... I left out the shredded cheese since I used the can. I already had a frozen double pie crust, so I used it in the provided pans, instead of a casserole dish. However, it worked out fine because what I couldn't fit into the pie crusts I made into a casserole with rice and topped with shredded cheese & bread crumbs... needless to say, my three picky girls ate the entire pot pie and part of the casserole!

Superb!  Only variation I made was adding fresh carrots & potatoes w/ frozen broccoli.  If you use fresh carrots you'll need to start them cooking first though.  Kids & hubby loved this dish.  Thank you!

I always heat up the inside stuff (spec the veggies since I use frozen) so the pie cooks in a normal timeframe. I also use the pre-made crusts from Trader Joe's. they are outstanding. So delicious and perfect. Otherwise I make no changes (except adding slightly more cheese because my life's motto is that there can never be too much cheese). This pie is amazing every single time and it is my absolute go-to every time I want chicken pot pie!

We LOVED this!  We made it for some friends we had over for dinner.  We'd never made chicken pot pie before.  After reading a couple of reviews we decided to add in some cooked and diced potato to take up some of the sauce.  Delicious and we already bought the ingredients to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loves chicken pot pie and asked me to make one.  I made this one and he loved it.  I did not add the cheese because I never had pot pie with cheese and because of the extra calories and it was still delicious.  I did cut up two small potatoes to add to my pie.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I only used a top crust since I figured the bottom would get too soggy.  I omitted the cheeses simply because I didn't have any, but I love cheese, so I will add it next time.  I also didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used a cream of mushroom with garlic along with the can of regular cream of mushroom.

It is hands down THE BEST pot pie you will ever taste. I can remember making this and my family went bonkers, and my friend at work adored it.  I just do a few things differently, I saute my mushrooms in some butter and olive oil and throw in a couple of boiled potatoes. I buy Albertson's premade pie crusts (the best I might add, tastes like homemade) brush with melted butter and bake. I read that someone topped theirs with parm cheese, I think I will give it a try. Anyway, this will be on the menu for this week, so if you hear something odd, like moans and groans coming from the SW this week around supper time, it'll be coming from our house! lol  Everyone needs to try this, you WILL NOT be disappointed.

Very good.  I changed the recipe slightly.  I made a double batch for 2 pot pies.  I cut the chicken into strips then pan fried it in light olive oil and seasoned it with thyme and Italian seasoning before cutting it into cubes.  I also don't care for the strong taste of onions, so I sliced up a medium size Leek and sautéed it with a tablespoon of butter and a dash of black pepper in a small sauce pan.  For veggies I used potatoes and a can of sweet corn.   I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  Lastly, I added about ½ cup of Almond Milk (or you could use any type of cow’s milk or even soy, I just has almond milk on hand) to make it a little creamier.  I also added an additional teaspoon of thyme into the mixture.  I used the 2 pie crusts, one of the bottom of the pan and one covering the mixture, brushed with beaten egg to make it golden brown.  I kept the rest of the recipe the same with the cheeses, cooking times, etc.  It was excellent.

This was a big hit with my family.  I made two pies for 5 of us and no leftovers!    I made a couple of substitutions because of the items I had on hand - I used monterey jack cheese in place of the mozzarella, and lipton onion soup instead of fresh onions.  It was terrific.

This was great.  I used chicken that I had already prepared that I keep in the freezer.  Had to use swiss cheese as I had no mozzerella.  Plus i skipped the mushrooms as my family doesn't like them.  But the flavor was wonderful.  Will definitely make again.

This is amazing! DO NOT substitute low fat cream soups. It will be runny instead of thick. If you make it as instructed, it holds it shape really well on your plate. Be sure to let it cool at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. It's 5 star with storebought crust, but 6 stars with homemade! My sister made it for me after I had my baby and it was soooo good! Now I make it as often as I can.

Oh! So good.  This was a great recipe.  I added the vegetables I like, and some of them were fresh, so it took quite a bit of extra time, but it was so worth it.  I had read comments that the filling was runny, but mine was fine.  In fact, it was rich and creamy.  I had never made pot pie before, and this was a great way to start.  Love this recipe!

Delish! Made this last night for my husband and my neighbors, they all LOVED it. First time I've ever had homemade chicken pot pie, all others have been frozen. But this is really good, my husband didn't like all the peas, but that's personal preferance, I think it was great!

I kind of just used this as a template, but it still was the best pot pie ever!!! The changes I made were the following...I added about 1 tsp sage, 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning, instead of the frozen veggies-I added diced celery, carrots, & potatoes. I didn't add the cheese because my husband did not like the idea. The crust was also really doughy on the bottom layer, so next time I will follow the other reviews and bake the crust for 5-6 min, then add all the ingredients.

I made this tonite for dinner and it was fabulous. I was in a hurry so I used a Rotissere chicken. I also used frozen mixed veggies, peas, carrots and string beans that I had in the freezer. I cubed a potato and boiled it for a few minutes and threw that in to. I used 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and also one cup of mixed shreeded cheese I already had in the frig. (Cheddar and Colby Jack). I only changed a few things because it was what I had on hand. It was so good. I have tried a few pot pie recipes and this one was by far the best, easist, and quickest. I think the cheese just makes it just right. I cant wait to make it with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

I have found my permanent chicken pot pie recipe!  Everyone really liked this.  I cut up the chicken before boiling it and added extra seasonings after draining off the water.  I also only used half of the cheese, and it had plenty of flavor.

This pot pie was DELICIOUS.  I can't believe how easy it was.  I only made 2 changes, mosst important I diced the chicken first and boiled it in chicken broth instead of water, it give it necessary flavor and 2, no extra sliced mushrooms.  I've made this twice in the last 2 weeks, and everyone raves about, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

this was a real husband and child pleaser thanks.  I had to use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and canned mushrooms because that was all I had and it still turned out great.  I will make individual pie next time though because the filling tends to run out when you cut into it.

I thought this recipe was delicious! I'm not a mushroom fan, so I substituted the mushrooms/frozen mixed veggies. Instead I cut up some fresh celery and carrots and boiled them in some chicken broth. I also used cream of potato soup instead of the cream of mushroom. It turned out wonderful!

This recipe is delicious! I made if for dinner and my husband and two-year-old son couldn't get enough of it. I also made several small, single serving pot pies in disposable foil pans with lids so my husband could take them to work for his lunches. He sent me a text message at lunch time to tell me how absolutely delicious they are. He said it's the best chicken pot pie he's ever had. The only thing I did different from the recipe is to use fresh veggies instead of frozen. Just make sure you boil your carrots and potatoes first.

Positively Yummy!  The only mistake I made was only having two pie shells on hand.  I upped just about all of the ingredients and baked it in a deep casserole dish.  With only the two pie shells to work with, the crust on top was "floating", but still tasted awesome.  Finished the leftovers over the week, and each day it tasted better and better.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. Completely and absolutely amazing! It was creamy, cheesy, and so hearty. I only made one modification. I added the mushrooms to the pot of chicken and onions, so they would be a little softer. It probably wasn't necessary, but I did it anyway. The flavor was amazing. I had thirds!

I will definitly be cooking this recipe again!!! It was delicious. I used homemade biscuit dough as the top and bottom crust instead of pie shells. The only thing i can say it needed was maybe a little Chicken broth to give the filling more juice. that would have helped with the dry crust

I am going to give this 4 stars because I am not sure what happened. When I cut into the pie it was really soupy.  After I drained it the taste was fine.   I will try and make this again.

Yummmmmmy!  This is fantastic.  I cut back on the cheese, used turkey instead of chicken and ommited the shrooms. I also added garlic powder, salt and black pepper.  I let it cool for a little over 30 minutes before serving.  Sauce was super thick and flavorful. Best chicken pot pie I have ever had.

AWESOME. Best chicken pot pie I've ever made. I used this recipe as a starting point and added more to it - my pot pie ended up as a "kitchen sink" pot pie. I added hot sausage and red & green bell peppers to the chicken and other veggies... The result was scrumptious!!!

This is comfort!  I have made it several times to give to new mom's and the like.  They always like it.  Something you can freeze and cook later.

This recipe was simple and tasted delicious!! I changed it up by using fresh veggies like corn, peas, carrots and broccoli and made 3 individual (mini bread loaf size) pot pies.

Love this pot pie - no need for me to look any further. I usually double this recipe, using only one crust (bottom) and topping it with cheese instead of the other crust - great way to make one for us/someone else who may need a dinner (new mom, etc.) I add Italian seasoning and a few dashs of garlic powder, omit mushrooms if I don't have any onhand. Using rotisserie chicken makes this incredibly tasty - going to try it with canned chicken for ease (and will always have ingredients onhand if that works out.) Effortless and so good!

Delicious! I have made this twice and loved it both time! It is very easy to make. To cut down on time, I buy a cooked rotisserie chicken and just add it to the mix. Next time I will add potatoes!

This recipe is delicious. Great comfort food for the winter! The only change I make is to omit the pie crust. Instead, I like to roll out a can of crescent rolls and place the sheet only on top of the pie. It's great!

I've been making this pie for so long now, I am surprised I didnt write a review before..but I'm making it again tonight and wanted to look over it to see what i needed to get from the store.  I read some reviews and they said that this was too runny for them....people...let it sit a little bit! Trust me...I know you wanna eat it right out of the oven because it is so good but let it sit if you don't like it runny it wont be so runny. Its even good as a left over!!  This is probably the best chicken pot pie in the entire world!!! I wanna give it 10000 stars!

I loved this recipe. I modified it for my boyfriend and used fresh veggies. He complained about the cheese, but he complains about everything. Next time I'll omit the cheese in his and double it in mine!

Awesome! The cheese definitely makes this pot pie extra gooey and delicious. I skipped the mushrooms and onions, and I made my own crust... very good recipe. Also, I diced the chicken before cooking and I put it in chicken broth rather than water.

This is really quite fantastic- a great way to impress dinner guests. I was concerned about the cheese, and almost omiitted it, but I left it in, and it was really great- not too cheesy- just creamy! I wasn't sure if the juices inside would pour over the edges during baking, so I put a cookie sheet underneath. I wouldn't do that again- because my bottom crust didn't get as crispy as I would have liked. Thanks so much for the recipe- it makes my husband very happy.

It really was delicious, but i did make a few changes. Used fresh veggies- carrots and english peas and cubed potatoes which were boiled. Really makes it more substantial and fresh-tasting. Even though it's an extra step, i added sauted garlic and it really gave nice flavor. For a little heat, few drops of tabassco was added. And don't forget to cover the top with a beaten egg for that golden look!

I made it for supper and accidentally forgot the mushrooms.  I made it with a store bought crust and there was a lot of the center mix part left.
It was awesome though and I will make it again.

I am a foolish person! I mis-read the 2 cups of veggies for 2 pounds of veggies. This made WAY too much filling for one pie; OBVIOUSLY! I made a mess, was cursing like a sailor, and forced myself to put down my phone to quit writing a less than helpful review which may have been mocked for all time. The good news is, the pie tasted good and I have pot pie veggies without the crust to eat at work for lunch. Hint to those out there that are not fans of lima beans, don't get mixed veggies with lima beans. Also read recipes carefully and if you think a recipe isn't right don't doubt yourself- re-read!

I added some potatoes and it was even better. I didn't have the chicken soup but did have a can of chicken broth. Worked perfectly. My wife says I have to do all the cooking from now on.

We loved this recipe.  The only thing I did different is omit the mushrooms (my husband doesn't like them) and I added one large, cooked potato cut up in cubes.  Since it's just the two of us, I used half of the filling to make a 9" pie and I froze the other half of the filling to make another pie at a later time.  This recipe was so tasty and very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing it Angie.

THIS WAS INCREDIBLE!!!! My hubby had 3 helpings...i omitted the bottom crust, after reading mulitiple reviews that said it was mushy i decided against it, also i didn't want the extra calories...everything else i left the same and since our pantry was bare (we had just come home from vacation) i served with rice....it was great and my normally picky 3yr old & 15 month old ate it up :)))))

This was my first attempt at making Chicken pot pie and my family LOVED it! I followed the recipe exact except that I substituted broccoli for the peas.  I used fresh vegetables instead of the frozen.  I also steamed the carrots and potatos for 10-15min before hand to ensure they cooked properly.

This is our go-to recipe for a cool fall day! It takes very little time, and the flavors are exceptional. It's also very forgiving if you don't have something on hand and swap some ingredients for others (I hate mushrooms, so I usually sub those with sliced potato chunks).  Highly recommend, a family favorite!

What a GREAT recipe! I usually don't do reviews, but I had to chime in on this one. My fiance says he has never had such good pot pie! I used my own pate brisee recipe (passed down from my great grandmother), and cooked it in a corningwear dish instead of a pie pan. I did use a little less cheese (by about a 1/2 cup) because I didn't want it too cheesy. I will for sure be making this again!

Wonderful recipe. I substituted the mushroom soup for cream of potato which gave it great texture and used fresh carrots and celery instead of frozen. This was delicious and easy to make. I plan on making this again and again.

This recipe was very flavorful.  The only change I made was to use cream of celery instead of cream of chicken.  I'm not sure if it was suppose to come out as runny as it did but my family and I didnt mind.  I will definitely be making this again using other meats.

This was amazing, and my hubby loved it! I used the pillsbury pie crust and sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top. I also only used 2 chicken breasts, but once they were cooked and diced we put them into the food processer to shred it a little. I used frozen carrots, green beans, and corn becuase that was all I had at the moment. I will never buy frozen pot pie again!

This recipe is so far one of my favorite things I have cooked since I signed up with All Recipes!  It tasted exactly like a Marie Calendars pot pie you would get in the store, only better, and with MUCH healthier ingredients!  Definitely brush top crust with an egg wash to get that true golden brown.  I could not believe how the crust held up the next day as leftovers.  Perfect dish!

This was an absolute hit! Everyone loved it. Leftovers barely made it to the next day. I did not have any poultry seasoning on hand, so I just skipped that part, but it still turned out wonderful. The only thing that would have made this better, a homemade crust.

This was great. I used other people's suggestions and used the Pillsbury ready-made pie crust, and had a little left over to make a heart on top. So cute! I also bought a ready-made garlic and pepper rotisserie chicken and then simply sauteed 1 cup of onions in chicken broth. I used 1 cup canned peas and 1 cup pre-sliced fresh crinkle carrots. Everything was PERFECT, although my carrots were a bit crunchy even after the hour bake time. Next time I will do something to soften the carrots before I add them to the mix. Regardless, it is winner! Thank you for the easy and delicious recipe!

Didn't want the heaviness of the double crust, so instead I did 6-7 layers of phyllo dough on top for some crunchiness (brushed with melted butter between layers).  Definitely a hit in our house - will be making again.

I followed the recipe but ended up with enough filling for 2 pies. I found the 1st pie a little dry but my husband really enjoyed it. The extra filling was used to make a 2nd pie, this time I added an additional can of Cream of Mushroom soup & some skim milk...FANTASTIC!!! Will definitely make again

Absolutely amazing. My family was impressed, as was I! I used a casserole dish, and only put pie crust on top. PERFECT! I believe crust on the bottom would have been too much. My son who does not like anything with veggies resisted at first, but had seconds once he tasted it.

This was soooo good!! I like to make it with small individual pies instead of 1 big one, although it's more work to make the crusts that way.  But that way the filling doesnt run out and it looks better for presentation.

Very yummy. I used some of the broth from cooking the chicken for the pie. I made two regular size pies instead of one deep dish and froze the other.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly (I don't review them if I don't) and I found it very tasty (and I like spice!)  So as for the reviews that have called it "bland," I personally did not feel that way at all about this recipe.  And as for the reviews that called it runny, well, it is... but isn't the center of a pot pie supposed to be?  I think the problem lies with making one big pie... it forces you to cut it like a "pie" and the filling just runs out.  The next time I make this (and I will, my family loved it), I am going to make individual sized pies by buying tiny individual sized tins at the store.  All in all this recipe is a keeper!

This was a really great recipe - very flavourful. I did change a couple of things but I don't think they affected the overall flavour. First I used no bottom crust and just used puff pastry on top, second I used a lot of leftover veggies in here from Thanksgiving (potatoes, corn, beans etc). But I think that part of a pot pie meal is to use up leftovers, or what you have on hand. I wasn't sure about the cheese in here, but I always try and stick to the recipe as much as possible and I was glad I did, you couldn't notice the cheese at all but it added to the depth of flavour and the gooiness. I did not find the sauce runny at all as some others mentioned.

This makes a lot more than 6 servings. I made two pies (purchased two pie crusts and only used them to top the pie) and froze one. I also improvised with the seasonings (instead of poultry seasoning I used pinch of sage, rosemary, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper) and vegetables (no frozen- I used parsnips and celery).  I am not a good cook so don't change ingredients much but I think you could get away with whatever you had- just keep the chicken, the soups, and the cheese and it whatever else you put in it, it should turn out ok.

very similar to my aunt's version. Use 1 can of soup instead of 2, add 1/2 chopped red bell pepper, 1/3 cup milk, used cheddar to sprinkle all over top before putting top crust on. perfect, not too runny.

This is a real keeper! This is one of those recipes where you don't need to adjust much. I did add a few boiled potatoes, and a few diced mushrooms. I boiled the veggies and potatoes until they were just done, but not too much because the dish has to cook even more in the oven. I suggest leaving the mushrooms out as it didn't lend much to the texture of the dish. Overall, you will have a hearty meal that feeds a bunch of people for very little money. Great for a cold evening, very wholesome and earthy.

This is a great recipe!  My husband loved and took some to work the next day for a coworker and she loved it too!  I did recipe identical to what is listed, however I only used 2 chicken breasts (2 good size ones) and chopped finely and that was more than enough, I think unless your using ver small chicken breasts you only need two.  I will also try making this again but with low fat ingredients and I think it will be just as good.  Also I added a little bit of garlic to the recipe.  I don't think I can ever go back to eating a pot pie out of a box again.

I decided to make this since the wife is at work and I am laid ond I have to say this was amazing. I didn't really measure anything just threw it in a bowl and mixed it up which posed a minor problem for the baking dish. I made it work and everyone loved it.

This recipe was AMAZING! I've never made chicken pot pie before, only eaten it. I was a bit skeptical about the cheese, but you honestly had no idea it was there once the whole thing was baked!  Also, instead of using a homemade pie dough, I bought two rolls of Pillsbury flaky refrigerated biscuits and flattened them out, one can for the bottom and sides of the dish, and another for the top! It was fabulous!

"Best pot pie I ever saw" and "better than mom's" were just a couple of comments I got on this dish. The cheese is like a secret ingredient. You can't really tell it's there, but it gives a wonderful texture and flavor. The frozen veggie mix I used had corn, baby carrots and asparagus, which was fantastic. The asparagus really added something. (I didn't have any mushrooms, but I'll use them next time if I have some.) I will be making this again soon!

Used 2 small boiled russet potatoes as I felt you have to have potatoes in chicken pot pie.  It was fantastic!

This was the best chicken pot pie ever! I like flaky and soft crust so i used croissant dough for the crust! Also i omitted the mushrooms and used cream of potato soup instead of cream of mushroom! Came out GREAT!

I've never made chicken pot pie before. It was fantastic and so easy. I think next time I'm going to take some of the suggestions and add a egg mixture to the top.

One word.  DELICIOUS!!!  I changed this recipe a little by omitting the mushrooms for 1/4 c. of celery and I used Mrs. Dash Chicken Flavor as the poultry seasoning.  BOTH MY MOM AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  For once, I'm actually going to eat leftovers!

This was Awesome!  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  For my frozen veggies, I picked a mix of zuchini, yellow squash, & cauliflower - they worked great!  My hubby loved it - ate 2 large helpings the 1st night and 2 the 2nd night!

This was such a great chicken pot pie! I will use this over and over again!! My husband couldn't get enough (he ate 3/4 of the pie!!) I used one of those pre made pie shells and puff pastry for the top, it was so delicious! (make sure to do an egg wash, it comes out so golden brown) I also used fresh veggies and cut up portabello mushrooms. Great recipe!!!

i am giving this recipe 3 stars:  one loss for lack of flavour and the other for the "soup" consistency once sliced.  I was not particularly happy with this one.  i had a feeling it might be runny, as per other reviews, but i added a lot of extra frozen mixed veggies and chicken and it still didn't help.  i have never made a pot pie before, so i didn't really have any major expectations, only to base the taste and texture on pot pies that i buy frozen from the store.  for  the effort it took and the money it cost (for the cheese and chicken mostly), this was not worth it.  the only suggestions i have if i EVER make this again is to add cornstarch or something to the mixture to soak up some of the liquid, even though it doesn't look runny in the bowl.  i'd add it just in case for when the soups and cheese heat up and become more liquidy.  i didn't want to add potato, as others have tried.  it would've been too heavy for me and less like a pie.

OMG!!! I'm keeping this recipe for sure. I did very little changes to it. I cooked the cut chicken breast in a pot with a small dice onion, clove of garlic and a 1/4 of white wine till it was cooked and almost dried. I only put very little of the cheese. The last ten minutes I set the oven at 400.
Thank you so much for this recipe. My husband and son love it!

This is good. I sauted fresh veggies then used leftover fried chicken that I chopped up. mixed everything together including more seasonings. I also didn't have a pie crust. so I used Bisquick. 1 Cup Busquick mixed with 1 cup milk. 1/2 stick butter sliced and layered on top, pour batter over top and cook 30 or so minutes till a nice golden brown and bubbly.

This chicken Pot Pie recipe is incredible! I would have never thought to put cheese in a Chicken Pot Pie, it was so good! The only thing I changed was the onions. I don't like onions at all so I used onion powder instead of the poultry seasoning when I cooked the chicken. The poultry seasoning I bought smelled bad. And I cooked the chicken to where it was tender enough to shred it. Came out wonderful. My husband loves it, I have already made it 3 times!

Delicious! this was very easy to prepare and turned out wonderfully. I wasn't sure about seasoning the water to cook the chicken in, so I used a bullion cube and put the onion and seasonings in the mix. I only used one crust on top of the pie and used 98% fat free soups with a smidge of milk. I used an egg wash on the crust. In my oven it was done in about 35 minutes and my family loved it.

This is my standby, when I don't feel like cooking.  This is a huge hit with my 3 boys and typically I use rotisserie chicken, which seems to be more moist thank regular old chix breasts.  I love the Pillsbury Ready made crusts and it turns out lovely!  Enjoy!  (An easy one to make when it's Mom's night out!!!)

This is a very good recipe, my first pot pie, homemade. I boiled a whole chicken and shredded, I also forgot to add the cheese. It was still a hit, did not miss the cheese at all.

Excellent. I used a vegetable mix with larger vegetables, squash, carrots, etc so a family member could pick out what he didn't like. It was easy as pie and tasted great even with the "unusual" vegetables. Don't change a thing!

This was delicous! I tweaked the recipe -- I used garlic/herb rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, both breasts (faster and lots of flavor). I sauteed the onion in a bit of butter and olive oil, and then added 8oz of chopped baby portabella mushrooms (more flavor than white buttons). I used these, plus a can of French green beans, rinsed, as my veggies. I didn't have 1 c Cheddar, so I used ~1/2 c sharp Cheddar and ~1/2 Mexican cheese blend, plus 1c Mozzarella. My boyfriend and I loved it!

My whole family raved about this recipe. I made a few modifications to it: instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of celery. I also added a T of fresh parsley, and rosemary and thyme, about a teaspoon of each. My 18-year old son said it was the best pot pie he had ever tasted, and I will definitely be making this again!

Out of every chicken pot pie recipe I have tried...this one hit the JACKPOT!  The cheeses that are added to this make the pot pie very thick and hearty and can fill up any big man's stomach with a smile!

Fantastic! Never heard of chicken pot pie made with cheese, but it was a great compliment to the dish.  All my other chicken pot pie recipes always came out tasteless.  This rocks!

First time ever making a pot pie - was very it easy to make.  I omitted the mushrooms and substituted the cream of mushroom soup for two cans of cream of chicken instead.  Turned out delicious.  Will make again for sure!

This was absolutely wonderful! It has a fun, cheesy taste to it, though I might add more even more cheese next time. :-) I am definitely making this again! Instead of making one 2 qt casserole, I made two 9 in pies so I could bake one and freeze the other. They weren't quite as full as I would have liked, so next time I will increase the recipe by half (6 chicken breasts, 3/4 cup onion, 1 1/2 ts. seasonging, 3 cans of soup, etc.) to make the pies nice and full.

Modified this a little cuz I don't do pie crusts.  So, I used a pack of Jumbo butter biscuits rolled two of them out for the bottom and stacked the rest on top.  I substituted half of a shredded rotisserie chicken then seasoned the chicken with Montreal Chicken seasoning for more kick.  Then baked it on the lower rack for 25 min.  I also added some pan fried Hash-browns to give it a potato element.

This is an easy and wonderful recipe to make. I didn't add the mushrooms, because my family won't eat them. But the cheese was not over powering at all.This recipe was not a soupy at all. I will make this recipe again and again. Thank u Angie Smothermon....

This recipe is a great base.  I use fresh vegetables including the corn.  I boil them for 5-10 minutes before adding them to the recipe.

This definitely has potential, but I didn't love the flavor.  I added fresh steamed brocolli and carrots (chopped) and frozen peas because that's what I like in my pot pie.  I used 98% fat free cream of chicken and the same of cream of mushroom. I would leave out the mushroom next time and use two c of chicken...I just didn't like the mushroom flavor even though I normally like mushrooms.  I would also change the soup to low sodium so I could control the salt and add some seasoned salt, celery, or garlic salt.  
As one other reviewer noted, it was a bit soupy...I would leave it be for a few minutes after it comes out of the oven so it has a chance to firm up. 
I might try this again...but for now I'll stick with Marie Callenders, sorry (*ducking*).

OMG!  Fabulous! Easy! I used pillsbury 9" pie crust, can of peas/carrots, bag of frozen corn, 1/4 bag of frozen hash brown cubes, seasoned salt, pepper.  Boiled the chicken in chicken broth. Whole family loved it and all of us hardly love any of the same foods.

Tasted OK... mine turned out a bit too runny even after resting for 1/2 hour after 55 minutes of baking.

My frozen veggies were thawed & I didn't use fresh mushrooms either...

My wife made this pot pie.  It was very good but, maybe a little rich.  Possibly it could have been thinned down a little.  Very good and I will ask her to make it again.

I have never been a fan of pot pies, but my mother made this for me a few months ago and it was absolutely wonderful. I now make it for my family and my children love it, too! The only tweak we made was adding celery.

I thought this was good, and easy to make, but doesn't quite warrant 5 stars.  For me, the poultry seasoning stood out too much - the sage seemed just a bit too overpowering for this dish.  Next time I might substitute salt, garlic powder, and maybe a little thyme or marjoram instead.  And fresh vegetables would help.  With a little tweaking, this recipe would be great.  I did use a frozen pie crust, and it turned out fine.

This was pretty good!  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth, added oregano, basil and garlic powder to the soup mix, and basted the pie crust with eggs.  I didnt have mozzerella on hand so I just doubled the chedder cheese.  I think next time I will try fresh veggies instead of frozen.  First time  was a success! I used the hyvee roll out pie crust and it was great.

This was the Best pot pie we've ever had! I used cream of celery soup rather than cream of mushroom soup. I didn't have any mushrooms, so I added celery. I substituted canned mixed veggies for frozen and monterey jack cheese for the mozzarella. For the crust I used Basic Flaky Pie Crust off this site...I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for a double crust using a 13x9 baking dish. I'll certainly be making this recipe again and again. Thanks for sharing!

This was the first time I have ever made, even tried chicken pot pie.  WOW!  My boyfriend loves pot pie and he said this is the best he has ever tasted.  I followed this recipe almost to the word and took another reviewers comments and it was absolutely wonderful.  No mess, perfect amount of filling and excellent flavor.  I added extra garlic because I LOVE IT!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great simple recipe. I made some changes.  Left out the cheese and mushrooms completely. Added 1/4 tsp of thyme, basil and oregano and minced onions. Used frozen vegetables, 1 can of low sodium, fat free cream celery, 1 can of low sodium, fat free cream of chicken, and frozen puff pastry from Trader Joe's to save time. Turned out yummy. Husband requests this frequently.

This was my first attempt at making a homemade chicken pot pie.  My husband is not a fan of cooked carrots and peas so I just used frozen corn and green beans. I would definetely add more cheese next time. But over all this recipe was great and the family loved it....even the kids. Thanks for sharing!!!!

This was incredible!! SOOO easy and delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I used cooked, cubed chicken that I already had in the freezer, so I just threw it in the pie with the uncooked onion and poultry seasoning- it worked great! We're also not keen on muchrooms, so I just used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, and put 3 cups of frozen veggies.  I think I'll have to make 2 next time and freeze one. We will be eating this a lot!

made few changes. Only 3/4 cup of ea vegetable.  4 stalks celery and 2 carrots.  Used Pioneer brand chicken gravy. It's 1.67oz so I used 3 pks. And so total of 4 1/2 cups of water.  I alternated vegetables, chicken then gravy. 3 layers.  Then slide knife down thru to be sure gravy got around good. Had foil around edge first 30 min. Then removed and moved the baking sheet down a level so pie on bare rack to the end.  I've made this pie 4 times. Changed the gravy this time.  Very happy with how it turned out.  I was told pie probably won't survive the night.  Everyone loved it.

Love it. I made some minor changes  to work with our family.
- 2 cups frozen corn, peas and carrot (thawed)
- one can of cooked potatoes (chopped)
- cooked the bottom shell first then put in all ingredients and the top pastry layer.
- 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery soup
- NO mushrooms or onions due to family preference.
- Cooked chicken in broth to add more flavour
- Cheese and seasoning as per recipe.
- Froze the pot pie at this point. Then to cook I thaw it overnight in fridge and cook as per instructions (till golden brown)

I love this recipe!  I make it all the time.  It’s so easy, tastes amazing and is great as leftovers.  The only thing I do differently is make one large one and a few individual pies bc it makes so much.  Highly recommend!

Our favorite chicken pot pie recipe EVER! I have passed this one on to several people.  I usually make 2 at a time. 1 regular version for the meat eaters and then I make a vegetarian version using Quorn naked chicken cutlets! Wonderful!

I had never made chicken pot pie before and I’m happy to say this came out great. Made some modifications though.  Only used three large boneless chicken breasts and used fresh vegetables of two celery stalks, two carrots, mushrooms and half of a large russet potato which I cubed and pre-cooked in boiling water. I also sauteed the mushrooms and vegetables before hand to soften and then added to the one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken soup and added about a half cup of chicken broth because it was too thick, seasoned with poultry seasoning, salt and pepper.  Used pillsbury pie crust with butter on top and precooked the bottom pie layer for 5 minutes to crisp, then cooked everything for 30 minutes.

Made as listed using Pilsbury packaged pie crusts.  Held together beautifully even on the 3rd day with leftovers.
BY far the best chicken pot pie we have ever had. Hubby loved this one!

So awesome!. I added peas, cooked potatoes and carrots and diced first before adding to mix. I think the people who said runny is because you have to "drain" the sauteed mushrooms, chicken, chicken broth, onions first before adding to the mix. I made this at request for my husband's birthday and I will make again.

I have made this dish so many times because it is my "go to" meal for moms with new babies. It is delicious every time and I always get asked for the recipe!  The only change I make is using 2 cans of cream of chicken (instead of the cream of mushroom) and I leave out the mushrooms just because we don't care for them. This is a staple in my house!

This was a lovely recipe. I altered it slightly, leaving out the cheese and adding a cup of milk to the mixture and then instead of pastry added a mashed potato top. It was delicious, and will definitely be making it again. Thanks

This is the first pot pie I've ever made.  When I told my hubby I was going to make it he said that he hated pot pies!  I made it anyway and he had two servings and took it to work the next day. Needless to say, I think he liked it!

This was awesome and super easy! Next time, instead of frozen veggies I will use fresh or canned so I can pick and choose which ones. I also omitted the mushrooms because we did not have any on hand. It is also very yummy reheated. I look forward to making it again!

This was delicious!  I substituted cream of broccoli soup for the cream of mushroom and added one can of potatoes (that I diced).  I also chopped about a 1/2 c. of celery and boiled it with the chicken and onion.  Since I included the potatoes, I decided to add an extra can of cream of broccoli.  Mine was slightly on the dry side, but I think thats because of the potatoes, so next time I will add a little milk to the chicken and vegetable mixture.  I even made an extra batch (in a 9x13) to bring to work for a pot luck tomorrow!

This recipe was the greatest!  I added bay leaves and minced garlic to the water as well and poked a bunch of holes in chicken with a fork prior to boiling.  Other than that, made it just like it says.  I have shared this recipe with everyone I know, it was that good.  Kids loved it too!

Wow, really good!  I boiled my chicken in chicken broth and added carrots and celery to cook with the onion since I didn't have a bag or can of mixed veggies.  It was a bit salty, but that's easily fixed by not adding salt!  Perfect with homemade crust.  Yum!

I made mine w/ 98% FF cream of celery and cream of mushroom, and 2% cheese.  It tasted great and my husband couldn't tell it was made with anything low fat.  We couldn't taste the cheese too much so I think I will leave that out next time to cut even more calories.  This may be because it was 2%, but I still think it will be great without it. Very easy to make and yummy!

My husband loves chicken pot pie, so I searched Allrecipes and found this version.  I made it based on the other reviews it received and I wasn't disappointed!  I also made some slight changes -- I omitted the onion and mushrooms, but added onion powder to the chicken.  I used frozen broccoli, cauliflower & carrots.  My husbands actual words were: "Wow, I'll have to keep you around a while longer after a meal like that".  :-)

This is excellent. I used an oil pastry crust and vidallia onions. My husband and two boys ate it for dinner, and leftovers the next day. It didn't last 24 hours. My 18 year old thought it was phenomenal.

Great chicken pie!  I made a pour over crust like someone else suggested with 2 cups self rising flour and 1 stick butter and mixed a little broth from where I cooked the chicken and then added milk until it was thin enough to pour on top.  Loved the cheese- never added cheese to a chicken pie before.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe when I was taking dinner to a friend recovering from surgery. My family, as well as hers, enjoyed it.  I found the recipe, as is, made 2 deep dish pies as opposed to a 2 qt. casserole.  I just made an additional top and bottom crust.  I added some sage and poultry seasoning in the mixture.  Additionally, my husband likes potatoes in everything so I added about a cup of frozen cubed hashbrowns.  The reason for the 4 stars is that is is really good, just not fantastic, but really good is good enough on a busy day!

My husband said this was the best Chicken Pot Pies he has ever tasted and it was so easy to make.  I did buy the ready made "PASTRY" crust, not the regular "Pie Crust".  I went to my sister's place and made it for them, and they at it all up.  Now time to go to my brothers : )

Terrific!  The cheese does not over-power the other ingredients as I had originally thought.  My family loved it.

This tasted pretty good, turned out well and i did follow directions except used only broccoli instead of mixed vegetables. We both liked it but did not have seconds as it seemed pretty fattening. Can't describe it really, just tasted like it was not super healthy. I did not look at nutrition info before making but a serving has 706 cals w/ 41 g fat. That is a little too much for me. Maybe using reduced fat everything, cheese, and soup, would help.
But except for that, this was my first pot pie and it turned out well.
