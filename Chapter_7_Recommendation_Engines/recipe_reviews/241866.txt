You had me at "fried" + "boiled" + "egg". I scaled the recipe down to one egg because I was peckish while working at home and just needed a snack. I boiled the egg the way I always do: rolling boil for 5 mins, turn off heat and leave pot as-is for another 5-6 minutes. Plunge egg into ice water for a few minutes. I sliced the egg crosswise into five pieces and fried them for about 2 minutes per side over med-high. Smashed some peppercorns, sprinkled on top. Yummy! The only thing I would change is the amount of butter--I didn't need as much as the recipe calls for and had to dab the egg slices with a napkin before eating.

This was too much work for little pay off. Interesting idea, but for me the frying didn't impart that much flavour, and I would much prefer soft boiled eggs or actual fried eggs instead. My 2 year old stole them off my plate though, so nothing wasted.  On the positive side, this gave me the chance to try steaming my eggs in my Instant Pot pressure cooker which I've been wanting to do. The eggs cooked quickly and peeled so easily.

I thought these were pretty good. I steamed my eggs, then followed the recipe, except I cut back on the butter. They are definitely interesting. I just ate mine sprinkled with salt, but I an definitely see it in a breakfast sandwich on tortillas or English muffins, maybe with a slice of ham and a bit of cheddar. Something my husband's already saying I need to do again.
