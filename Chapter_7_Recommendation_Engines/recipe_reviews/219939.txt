I halved the recipe to six servings and the only change I made was to add in two medium cooked shredded chicken breast. I cooked the breast in a pressure cooker and used that broth for the soup.  All the flavors of the spices came together very well in this soup. My husband and sons really enjoyed it. I threw some broccoli in the leftover soup I had for lunch the next day and that was a great addition also. I certainly will make this again.

OMG, this soup is good!  I did half the cayenne and white pepper to make sure my kids could eat it.  Glad I did, because it was still plenty spicy.  The dipping bread was a must!  Later when I ate the leftovers, it was great with a baked potato.  It made me think of all the options this soup presents.  Add chicken and broccoli like other reviewers suggest, thicken it a little more for a delicious sauce on veggies or fish or add a little Italian sausage to warm your belly.  I can't wait to make it again and "play" with it.

Spicy!  It came out a lot more spicy than I thought it would.  I wish I would have added some meat or veggies to it because it was rather plain.  I served it with bread to dip and that was a lot easier to eat than just the soup alone since it was so spicy.

Delicious with a bit of kick!  I did not make any adjustments to this recipe and we really enjoyed it.  To change it slightly, next time I will add some broccoli and cooked chicken.
