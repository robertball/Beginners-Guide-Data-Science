Pretty good. Definitely better than plain pancakes, but there's room for improvement and experimentation.

This is a deceptively simple recipe that brings a lot of flavor. I drizzled the honey on after buttering the cakes so I ended up using less pancake syrup. Combined with the vanilla and cinnamon it hit just the right notes.
