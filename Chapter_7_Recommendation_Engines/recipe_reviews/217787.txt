My family loved this! My three year old, who is very picky, just gobbled this one up. I also would add more cheese next time as it seemed to get lost in the other ingredients.

I really liked this, I followed the recipe in all aspects but I used a BBQ sauce that I use on my other BBQ. All in all it was very good and everyone loved it.

This turned out really good.  I skipped the chili sauce as I didn't have any.  I doubled (+) both the cheese and the ham as the chicken breasts I had were HUGE.  I added the onions to the glaze and brushed that inside and out.  I also brushed the glaze on a few times while cooking.  The chicken turned out so nice and moist instead of dried out like it sometimes does on the grill.  Will make this again for sure!

Didn't use the BBQ, but on the stove and followed the directions. Even used the left over pan juices on top of steamed green beans and even they were delicious!

Next time I would not use the Hientz chilli sauce.  The flavour did not seem to go with the rest of the ingredients.

Really liked it !!! The only thing I would change would be to add a little bit more  seasoning on the outside of the chicken ! But otherwise super good!

This was pretty easy and tasty.  I skipped the chili sauce and spread some dijon inside each breast.  I also baked them at 400 for about 35 min. and they were juicy and lightly browned.  I flipped them halfway through.
