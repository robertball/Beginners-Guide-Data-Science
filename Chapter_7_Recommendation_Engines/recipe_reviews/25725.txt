Great flavour.  I would add less salt though, as it was very powerful.

Must be a typo.  I cannot imagine putting 2T of salt in a soup of this size.  I put in 1T and it still tastes pretty salty to me.  Otherwise the flavor is decent, but nothing to write home about... or make again.

Man!  That was good!  I changed a few things though.  First I read the reviews so I knew to reduce to salt to less than a tbsp.  I put 1/2 tsp.  Perfect!  Then I added 1 lb of ground meat.  Last, instead of vegtable oil, I used olive oil.  My picky 7 year old even liked so much, he asked me to make it again.  Only next time, I'm going to shred the zuchinni so that maybe I can get our 3 year old other picky eater to eat it.  All in all, this hit the spot.

I think it would be okay except for the EXCESSIVE salt, which overpowers everything else. I too only used 1T, but it was still too much. I think you need to correct this. Not everyone reads the reviews before trying a recipe.

This is a very flavorful soup.  Would also be excellent with pasta noodles added to it.

I actually did not add mushrooms and opted to not puree the tomatoes and it came out great!

Wasn't overly fussy with this soup, but I have had worse. Probably won't make again though.

Instead of the canned tomatoes, I made this with a can of stewed tomatoes, a can of tomato puree and some chicken stock to keep the sodium level down.  I sauteed the onions and zucchini in olive oil and added oregano flakes. I added NO additional salt, just a dash of sugar.  I also added some asian rice noodles as I am gluten sensitive. It was wonderful.  Sprinkled grated parmesan cheese to top it off.  Will definitely make it again.

As written I found this to be just OK and more like the base for a pasta sauce than soup so I tinkered a bit and added 2 stalks of celery and 1 carrot, both diced and saut√©ed until softened.  It still wasn't I wanted so in went 2 cloves of garlic, minced.  Now the flavor was where I wanted it, but it was much too thick so  I added about 2 cups of chicken stock.  With my changes it came up to about 4.5 stars.  I'd need to tinker with the spices to get to a sold 5.
