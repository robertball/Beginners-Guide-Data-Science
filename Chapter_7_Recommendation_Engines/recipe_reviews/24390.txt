This soup was time consuming to make. what I did was to use a box of frozen artichoke hearts from birdseye. I added 1tbl. of olive oil with the butter. 2 cloves chopped garlic. You have to add enough salt and pepper, so I added 1tsp salt and1/2 tsp. pepper. At the end I poured it into a blender to puree. It came out creamy. I will not give this 5 stars as it was, but I will give it 5 stars as it came out my way.

I tried this recipe because I thought it looked easy and sounded very good.  This is a very bland soup.  The broth was not good to me at all.  I love leeks in soup, but i couldn't get over the broth.  It was not creamy like I was expecting.  Not something I would cook again.

I used an onion instead of leeks and heavy cream instead of milk....I also made sure the artichoke was very finely chopped....almost blended.

Had lots of artichokes so I scrape and cooked at the end I felt all the extra ingredient overwhelm the taste of artichokes next time will cut down on potatoes, celery and carrots
