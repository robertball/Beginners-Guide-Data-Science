Mmm, I just made this and really enjoyed it. I agree with the other reviewer who used less olive oil. Recipe calls for 3 tbsp, which I used, but 1 or 2 tbsp would have been plenty. I cooked the broccoli for a couple minutes first and also added spinach - both modifications worked out fine. Recipe makes enough for 3 large side portions, or 4 medium-size sides. I will definitely make this again!

Great flavor as is.  I used beef stock, fresh garlic to cook the quinoa; After fluffing the cooked quinoa, I added 1 lime juice and chopped red onions for extra brightness.  Definitely a 5 star recipe after the enhancements.
Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious!  Only changes were to cook the quinoa in homemade vegetable stock and I blanched the broccoli slightly (tossed some in with the quinoa for maybe the last five minutes of cooking time).  I'm not even a big tarragon fan, but the flavor of the tarragon, garlic, lemon and mustard blend together perfectly in this dish.  I actually had some of this while still warm and it would make a fabulous side dish or light meal, as well as a salad! Thank  you jjane123! This one's a keeper!

I have to admit I was a little scared of how much mustard was going into this, but it turned out perfectly! Make sure you use coarse-ground mustard!  I chopped the broccoli into tiny pieces (about dime-sized) and I threw it into the cooking quinoa for the last 3 minutes so it would soften slightly and get a nice bright green color.  I also used about 1.5-2 cups of broccoli because 3/4 cup just wasn't enough.  While the quinoa was cooking, I whisked the rest of the ingredients (minus the beans) together in a bowl. Once the quinoa and broccoli was cooked, I tossed in the beans and "dressing", and voila! Perfection! I will definitely make this one again!

I LOVE this dish.  Yes, you can cut down the olive oil  - 1 1/2 T is great.  Did try out carrots and dill once when I was out of broccoli and tarragon - not that great - stick to the original recipe.  Oh, and I do not normally eat broccoli but great in this.

100 percent easy and delicious! I made this by first cooking dry garbanzo beans, then followed the prep steps. I recommend blanching or steaming the broccoli a few minutes to ensure it's tender. I also mixed in 3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese for some tangy flavor.

This was so amazing! I made it as a side dish and my 5 and 3 year old each ate an entire bowl.... I had to make a second batch! I will be holding on to this recipe!

Quinoa is excellent because it is a complete vegetable protein. (one of the very few that has a balanced set of amino acids) 
My only advice is to find a source for your quinoa that is decently priced. I'm sure the price turns a lot of people off to this wonderful grain (I've found it for as much as $4.80 for an 8 oz. box in the grocery store!!). At our local co-op it's only $1.60/lb in bulk.

I modified this by using millet instead of quinoa and sprouted garbanzo beans instead of the canned variety.  This is a great tasting salad!

This seemed rather bland to me. I made it exactly as written, and wasn't all that impressed. I did add a little extra broccoli, because it didn't seem like enough. Altogether it was okay, but I had a hard time finishing it...the dish tasted really healthy, and not all that exciting. Thanks for sharing, though!

I decided to make this into a hot entree. I used 4 garlic cloves, half an onion, sauteed them up and threw in steamed broccoli and red peppers with the quinoa and chickpeas. The tarragon, lemon juice and dijon mustard complemented the entire dish beautifully. Will make again.

I love this! It wasn't until I was done cooking that I realized I used couscous by mistake. I made WAY too much of it so I added 1/2 a can of black beans to even the flavors back out. Added a bit of colour and flavor. I will be taking this to my boyfriends families house for dinner. It would also make a great lunch for me.

I'd give this 3-1/2 stars if I could. This was a good base salad, but everyone at the table agreed that the garbanzo to quinoa ratio was off. Next time, I'll start with a whole cup of the uncooked quinoa and might experiment with adding more veggies in addition to the broccoli.

Yum! I've never had quinoa before, and this was a great first try, tho I admit I wasn't crazy about the taste of it just after cooking. In the salad, it was great. I added more broccoli cause I wanted to use what I had. This is really tasty, and I'm looking forward to using this recipe to add more fiber rich dishes to my family's diet.

Enjoying this for lunch right now.  I used asparagus instead of broccoli since that is what I have on had.  I think I liked this better before I added the mustard tho.  Next time I plan on using more lemon juice and no mustard.

Very good for the amount of effort required (which was very little).  I added toasted slivered almonds for a bit more texture and was glad I did.  Depending on your raw garlic tolerance you may wish to use only a small clove, or leave it out.  If you've never tried raw broccoli, this is a good recipe in which to try it,

Very easy to make, great tasting and healthy - what more could you ask for?! I subbed 2 tsp of Dijon mustard for the coarse grain and used 2 i/o 3 tbsp of olive oil. Also, after reading other reviewers' comments that this dish came out too bland, I used half a veggie cube to cook the quinoa. With these changes the flavor is subtle, but very noticeable, especially the fresh garlic, lemon juice and Dijon. I also like to mix red and white quinoa for a more striking presentation/enhanced flavor.  One note on the serving size, in my experience this makes 2-3 portions (or 4 very small portions), so if this is your main side or your main course, you might want to double the recipe.

A bit bland for my taste.  I cooked the quinoa in water but when I found the whole dish bland I sprinkled 1/2 a pack of low sodium chicken stock powder which helped some.  I would make again but add a bit more spice.

I LOVED this!  This is what did it for me though I think.  I subbed one of the TBL of Olive Oil for 1+ TBL of Ken's Lite Sweet Vidalia Onion Dressing.  And maybe a little more tarragon.  My broc. was frozen so I nuked it just a little and let it set while the quinoa finished.  Then put the quinoa over top of the broc. (which I drained) then cold chickpeas cuz I already had them cooked in the frig.  Then I mixed my sauce as I only had dried minced garlic and I wanted it to reconstitute a bit before adding.  When I mixed it together, the quinoa had gently warmed up the chickpeas and broc. and it was just a lovely burst of flavors and textures.  I can only assume the flavor will improve after it has time to hang out together in the frig.  Thanks for sharing!

As written, I was torn between 3 & 4 stars. If I could have given it a 3 1/2 I would have. I felt that it was basically pretty bland. Also, I wasn't too trilled with the mustard taste coming through which surprised me as I thought that I would have had a problem with that much lemon, but it gave it a nice, bright note without being too overpowering. I ended up tossing in some dried cranberries, sautéed orange sweet pepper and red onion and chopped walnut and almonds that I first toasted in a skillet. I'll definitely make this again, but with my modifications.

I tried this recipe because it was so healthy and I liked a lot of the individual ingredients. I should have known it wouldn't be my favorite since I'm not a big fan of the flavor of mustard, and that really comes through.

This was a simple, quick, tasty and healthy recipe.  It wasn't an OMG thing, but definitely something I will keep handy for a quick meal. From reading it, I was worried that it would be a little bland, so I sauteed about 1/4 cup each chopped onion and green pepper, then added the quinoa and water along with a bouillon cube.  Once it was done, I still found it bland, so I added some cumin and smoked paprika.

Doubled the recipe as the original amount didn't seem to make very much.  However, only used half the amount of olive oil and it seemed to be fine.  A terrific salad as it was very healthy, easy to make, and inexpensive.  Would love to try it another time with feta cheese and maybe slivered almonds!

If you chop the broccoli small you don't have to parboil, but if you like bigger pieces, I would parboil.  I love this recipe and could make it daily!  I add 2 shakes of curry powder when I cook quinoa.  Also, I like to add some chopped tomatoes and I take advantage of fresh tarragon from the garden.  I really like the dressing of only olive oil, lemon and mustard. Really great recipe.

4.5 stars if I could. I doubled the garlic, cut olive oil to 2 TBSP, and otherwise followed the recipe. It is excellent. Can't put my finger on what exactly would make it a "5" for me.  I will try doubling the recipe next time!

Not a big fan. I really wasn't digging how the broccoli and dijon tasted together. Edible, but not worth making again.

so yummy! The only change I made was to cut the amount of olive oil in half (as other reviewers had done) and I dont think that modification took anything away from the flavor in the dish.  healthy and easy, quick to put together for a light lunch.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good Quinoa dish if you like mustard flavors.  I personally did not like the garbanzo beans in there, because of the mix in textures.  Would make this again without garbanzo and maybe a little less mustard.  I added sauteed onions, which was great!

I respected the recipe faithfully, and the end result was an OK meal.

The idea of mixing these different healthy ingredients is great, but my mouth had a hard time
adjusting to the somewhat clashing flavors.

It's either that, or there seemed to be missing something to bind the flavors together better.

This was a great way to use quinoa and get some veggies and fiber too. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I cooked my garbanzos from dried, ahead of time, and I blanched my broccoli because I like it more tender. Also like many other reviewers I did decrease the amount of oil used. 
I imagine this recipe would also be good with toasted nuts, sauteed onions, or other add-ins. As-is, it's a terrific vegetarian way to get a well-balanced meal, and makes a really nice lunch for work days or a picnic.

This IS great, well balanced and open to change:  I have no tarragon or mustard, but love dried cumin in this type of thing. Used a whole broccoli bunch (florets, steamed), a whole cup quinoa instad if 1/2, so 1 1/2 tsp or more of dried cumin and at least 3x the citrus, crumbled feta added - OH BOY! Absolutely satisfying.

This is really good!  I used two cups of steamed broccoli and halved the olive oil, still plenty of flavor and made enough for four lunch-sized servings.  My husband says this one is a keeper!

I finely diced the garlic and added it to the pot when I cooked my quinoa. To cook the broccoli a bit, I followed the suggestions of other reviews and added the broccoli in at the end of my 15-20 minutes. I preferred the broccoli cooked for about 8-10 mins. I used an entire head of broccoli as well. I felt like the flavor was a bit lacking so I put in quite a bit more mustard and salt. Started at 2 tablespoons and then to taste from there. All in all, it made for a quick and healthy meal! Thanks for sharing :)

Loved this recipe. As other cooks suggested, used less olive oil, half a lemon, sun dried tomatoes, and roasted cauliflower. I also whisked the dressing together before adding it to the mixture. I have made it twice now and it is great warm or cold. Tried adding feta cheese once and it was okay but why add the cheese? Keep it vegan for better health!

Delicious!  Had red quinoa on hand and roasted leftover cauliflower - this was a meal in itself.  My daughter even requested some in her lunchbox for the next day.  Would be wonderful with other vegetables added or spinach or a topping of fresh tomatoes.

This is a great clean-tasting and filling recipe. The lemon and garlic are a great statement. This is a meal in itself and contains all kinds of good-for-you ingredients. I'm probably late to the party, but I've never tried quinoa before. I'll have to look for more recipes!

I'm a big fan of quinoa and I really like garbanzo beans, but I have to agree with a few of the others - this recipe was a bit bland.  I ended up adding some cumin to help lift the flavor.

Good base recipe. I added a bit of oregano instead of tarragon, extra lemon juice, some smoked paprika, and a little kale and chard to make it more filling. I could stand more mustard as well, but it's a pretty tasty, light main dish.

Loved this!!! Doubled the quinoa and doubled the cooking liquid which I used fat free low sodium chicken broth instead of water. Cooked the fresh broccoli in the broth and quinoa mixture. Also had to use a spicy brown mustard since I had no coarse grain left. Loved the tarragon/mustard/garlic flavors.....this was really good warm last night and even betttr cold today for lunch. Healthy and delicious!

This makes alot, even for a week's worth of lunches for one person. That said, this is a tasty salad. I opted to steam my broccoli, reduce the evoo and used regular Dijon mustard.

Wow!  I've wanted to make this recipe for a while and finally did it today!  VERY surprised!  I'm new to Quinoa, so I cooked it w/ chicken broth.  I also read other reviews and decided that I need "crunch" in a meatless meal, so I did NOT blanch the broccoli - just cut into smaller pieces.  The only thing I changed was I took twice the garlic and infused the garlic, tarragon, and oil for about a minute or so... Awesome!

Made it as is - next time I will substitute beans for another veggie and serve chilled. Overall a great, healthy side dish.

This is delicious! I cooked the quinoa in vegetable stock and it came out wonderfully. I used roasemary and sage to season mine, and added a little garlic powder (I love garlic hehe) as well. Yum Yum :) Now I just have to test it out on my little girl (1 yr) to see how she likes it :)

This is definately a 5 star recipe!   I have made it twice now, the first time I used dill instead of tarragon (never used it before & didn't have any) and it was good, but nothing special.  Bought tarragon and WOW, it is an amazing blend of flavors!  Absolutely fantastic...  Only other changes were: Added 1 cup of sugar snap peas (because I love them), cut the garbanzo''s down to 1 cup (to make it more WW friendly) and cut the EVOO down to 2 teaspoons.  Don't think these changed the taste too much, just brought down the calories a little.  I also cooked the quinoa in veggie broth, because I like it that way and added the garlic to the quinoa while it was cooking.  Thank you jjane123 for an amazing vegan recipe, love it, love it!!

Wasn't crazy about this.  Added some red onion, red pepper, and a little extra broccoli and it still seemed a little bland.  Might try again with feta, as some of the other reviews have suggested, and maybe some cumin and/or red wine vinegar.

Absolutely excellent salad - I served it cold and it was really refreshing with that lemony dressing.  Great with BBQed meats and a simple lettuce salad.  Thank you for sharing this recipe jjane 123 with the rest of us... Definately a keeper.

This was great! And so easy!! I had a quinoa/bulgur blend in the pantry. Eye-balled the EVOO and threw the broccoli in for the last few minutes of simmering based on other reviews. Definitely will make again and recommend to friends!

This is an easy recipe to make.  Be carefully of the type of extra virgin olive oil used.  I used one a bit strong so it overrides the other favors.  If you like a bit of kick to your dish I would suggest experimenting each time. I like more of a Middle Eastern flavor.

We have had this a few times and is simple and delicious! I use chopped spinach, a large handful, instead of broccoli because it was on hand and was great. My husband ate this with a salad tonight and wants it more often!

This dish is great.  Made it for dinner - it's a really quick and healthy meal.  It took less than 30 minutes from start to finish.  Modification: I only added one Tbsp of olive oil. It really didn't need any more than that.

this was just ok. I didn’t feel that the recipe had enough veggies, so I added spinach and mushrooms to the broccoli. I cooked them separately and added more garlic. I also cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth. suffice to say, the results were underwhelming even with the tweaks, and I won’t be making this again.

I would have liked it with less olive oil.  The oil taste was overpowering.  Changes:  I cooked dried garbanzos in vegetable broth and onions then used a cup of the broth to cook the quinoa.  I also cooked the broccoli because I don’t like raw broccoli.  The combination of garbanzos, broccoli and quinoa was very tasty but the dressing needs to be tweaked.  I should have read other reviews first. Oops.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe. However, I am not a huge fan of tarragon. To suit my own taste buds, I increased the lemon juice to 4 tablespoons full  and I added in a tsp of red pepper flakes. I also had some leftover sliced olives and I threw a few of them in as well. I like the addition of garlic, but I also added in some garlic powder when I made the dressing with the lemon juice and olive oil and all the seasonings. The next time i make it, I may parboil the broccoli for just a couple minutes. I wasn’t crazy about it being raw in the salad. Good basic recipe open to tweaking. I like that!  With changes, I will definitely make it again!  Thanx!

I really liked this salad. I recently switched to a vegan diet and this dish did not disappoint in flavor or texture. My husband and I are not broccoli fans, so we substituted raw kale instead and it was delicious. I doubled the recipe so we could have an easy meal to take to work throughout the week. The only reason I didn't give this salad 5 stars was because the tarragon was a new flavor for me and I wasn't crazy about it.

I made this exactly as written, and it was a very nice blend of flavors!  Hubby requested for me to make it again.  Kids didn't care for it though.  I like that this meal is vegetarian but also supplies plenty of protein.

This was tasty, but a little bland as written. I did decrease the oil to 1.5 tbsp. After tasting it, I added finely chopped red onion. If I made it again, I'd probably add something to give it a little spice and something crunchy, like slivered almonds.

This recipe is great. I made it pretty close, omitting one can of black beans and adding 3 cloves of garlic instead of one. I think the balance of olive oil, lemon juice and vinegar was perfect. It tasted so fresh! I lovew the mint and parsley tastes. Overall, a great recipe.

I thought this was a really good dish. However, I added a couple of flavors that perked it up a bit. In addition to the recipe I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of low salt Soy sauce, 2 thinly sliced scallions, 3 cloves of garlic and a dash of red pepper flakes. I cooked the Quinoa in chicken broth and cut down on the oil. I found it to be great warm or cold. I'm sure there is a lot you can do to this recipe to change it up with many different flavors. Next time I'll try some Greek flavors with Feta, Mint and Oregano. Thank you for a great dish.

This was an easy and healthy recipe to make and when I first mixed the sauce in it tasted really yummy.  However the sauce was quickly absorbed into the quinoa leaving the whole thing lacking moisture.  I thought the sauce was nice but I will try this in the future without the tarragon.  Again, nice flavor at the beginning but I grew tired of it pretty quickly.  Maybe I'm just not a tarragon person.  It's a good base recipe that I think you can adjust with your preferred spices to make it your own.  I topped it with crumbled feta cheese to give it a little something extra.

I use 1 1/2 cups broccoli and blanch it, and add 2 tablespoons of diced red onion.  I think it is best to make the dressing and then add it the salad.  It is easy to adjust the dressing a bit to suit your individual taste.  This is delicious at room temperature as well as chilled.  Tomato and feta can add a nice touch.

The ingredients made this look good.  However, it turns out my wife discovered she did not like Tarragon, so that ruined it for her.  I thought it very bland and "fixed it" by adding a little Balsamic vinegar.  We probably will not bother making this again.

Best Recipe Ever!!  I loved it.  I blanched the Baby Brocolli (Brocollini) that I thought would fit this recipe better, and then I sauteed some mushrooms, onion, and extra garlic in the same pot I used to blanch in.  When the onions and mushrooms were done I took it off the stove and added it to the Brocolli Bowl and started the Quinoa (I only had Red Quinoa), re-using the same pot again.  Then I made the dressing in the same measuring cup I used to measure the Quinoa, and added it to the veggie bowl along with the Garbanzo Beans.  When the Quinoa was done, I mixed it all together in the same bowl.  How Yummy AND Healthy can you get?!  And I only used 1 pot and 1 bowl.  See my pic!  :-)

just a note.....Quinoa is NOT a grain, it is a complete protein, and Garbanzos are not a complete protein, but awesome complex carbohydrate, full of wonderful nutrients.   Delicious

OMG!! This was awesome! I used a little more lemon juice (hubby likes tart/sour food) I also used less olive oil... and I substituted navy beans because we don't care for garbanzo beans.

I tried this using about 1/3 of the olive oil called for and really enjoyed it. Next time I make it, I will double the recipe, add a touch more lemon juice and use just the one can of garbanzo beans.

We loved this when it was slightly warm. I didn't have any tarragon, though, so I just omitted that. Otherwise, a fantastic high protein dish!

I was looking for a non meat/dairy recipe. I was a little skeptical because of the grain mustard.  I normally don't like it at all.  I followed the recipe. I did ad wet ingredients and whisk them in bowl with garlic first. After adding quinoa, I put in broccoli and garbanzos. Adding salt ane pepper it all came together great. Mustard was mild and tarragon was a nice back flavor. Will make again.

Yummy and easy recipe!  Made it for lunch , now gonna make it again for dinner for my family!  Didn't have broccoli so added a cup of sliced spinach and added to the quinoa when hot.  I think you can really use any green but just may need to blanch depending on the veggie.  Also didn't have whole grain mustard so used whole grain Dijon instead.  Delicious !

Very tasty! I had no tarragon so used fresh thyme instead which was very good. I also added some grated carrot, blanched the broccoli, and then, to my serving, added toasted slivered almonds and golden raisins. The recipe is a great base to build on to , or cater to your own tastes. I make a quinoa salad every week and this is definitely going into the rotation. thanks for sharing!

Delish but note that quinoa is also a complete protein, not just a grain. A nice touch is to cook the quinoa in vegetable broth then proceed. Can't go wrong with this dish

Very good.  I added chopped onion to give it a little depth of flavor, and used less olive oil than required.  I kept the broccoli raw, but chopped fairly finely.  Very nice.

I followed this recipe but tweaked it a bit. I also added broccoli and less olive oil than what it calls for. I added some fresh cilantro and I also added chopped cucumber. I really enjoyed it chilled! Perfect summer salad!

This was my first time trying quinoa and i absolutely loved this dish.  I added just a little more mustard for extra tang.  It was even better the next day.  It was so good i made it again 3 days later.

The first time I made this I didn't have ground mustard and used dijon - big mistake. Gross.  I wanted SO BADLY to like this dish. 2nd time I made it with the changes that other users said to, less olive oil ( glad I did or else it would have been swimming in it) and blanched broccoli (again glad I did as I liked my broccoli slightly cooked and dislike raw).  It was a bit better but not much.  I don't know if it is the tarragon or the mustard but the flavor was just not something I could handle.  So sad because I've wasted 2 recipe's worth of food trying to make this dish. So disappointing.

I made this recipe with some modifications and it was delicious.  I used sauteed cauliflower and red peppers rather than broccoli.  I used beef stock to make the quinoa.  I also used sage, rosemary, and thyme because we didn't have tarragon!!!...It was awesome!

This is a good healthy meal.  The mustard and tarragon lend the quinoa a slightly warmer taste than other quinoa recipes that use tomato and cilantro.

It was a hit.  I will add to it next time, but there is nothing wrong with it just the way it is!

This recipe gave me the push to try this Quinoa I've been reading about. A super simple recipe that was delicious. I'll be making Quinoa at least a couple of times per month from now on.

5 stars. Absoulutely delicious. Even my husband loved this recipe and he is more of a meat eater.
