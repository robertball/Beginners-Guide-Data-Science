Absolutely terrible! The cake grew and grew till it spilt out of the pan and made a huge mess in my oven. Then it wouldn't come out of my pan and once it did it looked and tasted terrible! Will never make again. But might have been better if I used less baking powder. I recommend using 2 teaspoons or even less!
