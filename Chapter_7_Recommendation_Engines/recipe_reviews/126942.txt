I love ricotta gnocchi! Not only is it simple to make it creates a hearty, satisfying meal. I make mine slightly different. I drop the dough into boiling water to cook. When the gnocchi rise to the top they're cooked through. They are really good with pesto sauce too. I usually double or triple the recipe and freeze so I always have some on hand for a quick meal.

The first time I ever made Gnocchi, like many others.  This could have cooked 4 to 5 minutes without damaging them, and the quick 1 to 2 minutes was not enough to cook the flour dough.  Shook my boots with the garlic powder: YUM!  I soaked this in the sauce for a day before serving.  HEAVEN.  Too much black pepper for many people.  Halve it if you are uncertain.

A huge hit with Mr P this evening, he definitely rates it as a keeper (he's now sitting groaning about how full he is, greedy gutbucket). Made exactly as per recipe - very easy and stunningly delicious results. Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent gnocchi recipe and didn't have to add any additional flour (didn't make the sauce). There is a trick that will make this come out perfect, except it adds one easy step. It's straining the ricotta, but you can't just stick it in a strainer like you would peas as folks tried. 

So here's what you do: When you're at the store, buy the 15/16 oz container of ricotta (you'll use the whole thing). Head over the isle where they sell cooking wear and pick up some cheesecloth. It run $2-5 depending on where you live.  Fold it over 4 or more times. Put 1/2 of ricotta in the cheesecloth and squeeze the moisture out of it. Do the same with the other 1/2. You'll end up with 1 cup of dense ricotta. Voila! Perfect for gnocchi making.

I also used 1/2 ww flour and 1/2 regular flour; minced garlic instead of powdered. Finally, instead of rolling it out and messing up the counters, I did it old school style and just pinched very small amounts (abt. 1 1/2 tsp) and rolled them. I ended up with 50 gnocchi. Perfect! Definitely a keeper.

I've been making ricotta gnocchi for years, thanks to Biba's Italian cookbook.  So easy! 1 container ricotta, any type, 1 Tablespoon grated parmesan, 1 tsp. salt, 1 cup all purpose flour.  It is no fail, it's tender and delicious, and when my father in law was alive (Italian) he liked mine better than his wife's who used potatoes.  No eggs in this recipe!

Good premise, but why would you ever add garlic powder to your gnocchi? I'm a second-generation Italian, and can state categorically that no self-respecting Italian person with any connection to the old country would ever cook with garlic powder, let alone have it in his kitchen. Once you delete that stuff, this is a good, solid recipe for an old favorite. After cutting the individual gnocchi, roll them over the back of the tines of a fork, applying more pressure in the center, to get that authentic gnocchi appearance. The little valleys the fork tines create cradle your sauce. Gnocchi are nothing more than dumplings, Italian style. They can tend to be slightly heavier than normal pasta, which some don't find appealing. Those made with ricotta tend to be lighter than those made with potato, which is the more common variety. The sauce is a basic tomato/basil, which should work well for most palates.

So good and easy! This was my second attempt at Gnocchi and far better than the first traditional recipe I tried. I used fresh garlic and added fresh basil and it was just fantstic. I skipped the sauce recipe and used my own recipe. My 18 month old could not get enough of them. Tomorrow I am going to make another batch and freeze them.

delicious, quick, fancy and satisfying. like another reviewer, i also boiled them. i think this would make an easy, cheap and plentiful appetizer if wrapped in a basil leaf and stuck with a fancy toothpick and served with some marinara. 

a little goes a really long way.

This is a really heavy meal so be sure to have your antacids handy.  The Gnocchi was awesome however the sauce was too cheesey.  Next time I'd only add more tomatoes but only about 1/2 the mozzarella (4oz).  I used part skim ricotta and 2 instead of 3 Tbs. of oil to cut down on the fat.

This gnocchi was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  Everyone LOVED it and asked for the recipe!  I had made some expensive gnocchi that I bought premade (just needed to be boiled) and everyone ate all the Ricotta Gnocchi and said the grocery kind was nothing compared.  One warning though...it was VERY filling!!!

Amazing, simple, quick and FULL of calcium! I subbed 1/2 whole wheat flour, and didn't make the sauce. Instead, I sauteed them lightly (after boiling) in olive oil with baby spinach, sliced garlic, chopped basil and freshly grated parmesan. Perfect, delicious, less fat, and my toddler even ate the spinach!!!

This was delicious!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I was confused by other reviewers who said they changed the recipe by boiling the gnocchi...but that is what the recipe asks you to do.  I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did make more sauce than called for, because we love sauce.  This was a great change from our usual pasta staples.  It's very filling.

Unbelievably easy to make and delicious. The only other time I attempted to make gnocchi as described on a TV show it turned out to be a sloppy gooey mess. But after reading the other reviews I decided to try it. I read other comments about no liquid coming out of their cheese.  I had to measure 1 cup from the large container I had and when I drained it about 2 Tab. water was in the bowl. Probably because I packed it into the cup. The 1 cup flour was perfect for making a nice consistency dough. I also followed the advise of another person that said she used a tabelspoon measure instead of cutting pieces off of ropes. This was so easy...very little clean up. I scooped a spoonfull and used my finger to drop onto a cookie sheet that I had lightly floured. I then shaped them into little logs as I rolled them in the flour. I had a second sheet lined with wax paper. I put them onto the paper and then pressed the point of a fork into them. I didn't put into the 'frig. Instead I put the pan directly into the freezer. After a couple hours they just lifted right off the wax paper. I then put them into plastic bags until I was ready to cook. I always feel the worst part of making any dough recipe is the cleaning of the counter afterwards. This way there was only the one pan to clean when I was done. I didn't have the ingredients to make the sauce, so I just opened a can of Dei Fratelli All Purpose Italian Sauce. It was great. My daughter couldn't believe I made the gnocchi myself.

I have made ricotta gnocchi several times using this recipe, with a couple of small modifications to make it healthier- I use low-fat ricotta and whole wheat flour, and it turns out delicious without being as heavy. I also just drop them into boiling water and let them cook until they float to the top, which seems to take more like 6-7 minutes. I also am not a huge fan of the red sauce on it, which seems to me to overwhelm the delicate gnocchi, so I like to switch it up and make different sauces. I have made this with a wild mushroom sauce, a goat cheese sauce, and a gorgonzola sauce and the gnocchi paired well with all three. I love the fact that this uses ricotta rather than potatoes, since it saves a ton of refined carbs.

REAL authentic Italian taste. I did not find this too cheesy, as some other reviewers did. I found the mozzarella made it perfect. It is also sooo simple to make.

My husband swore up and down that he doesn't like dumplings of any kind--apparently he was wrong. :) He loved these and this recipe will be in our regular rotation. Unequivocal 5 stars from us.  I don't work with dough very often and was worried I'd mess up the gnocchi, but they came out great--much lighter than gnocchi I've had at restaurants. I did add additional flour to make it workable, but it's been pretty humid so I expected that. The flavor was great--the pepper wasn't too much for us at all and I'm going to experiment with adding spinach as others have suggested. I "drained" my part-skim ricotta for about 1 hr but no liquid actually came out of it. I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes which may have been a mistake as it cooked down quite a bit (maybe we simmered too long?) and wasn't saucy enough, though the flavor with the basil was awesome. Next time I'll use different diced tomatoes or add tomato sauce since we'd like our sauce liquid-y to soak into the gnocchi. We added ground turkey to make it heartier and I think we may add mushrooms next time as well. Thanks for a great recipe! :)
Edit 9-10-12: We've used this gnocchi recipe twice now to make a chicken soup with ricotta dumplings. AMAZING and straight up a cure for the common cold!! You think the gnocchi is good now, wait till you boil them in chicken soup!

I had some leftover ricotta mixture that had fresh spinach in it, from some manicotti I'd made.  I added flour and made these and used the same sauce I had made for the manicotti.  To my amazement, they cooked perfectly and came out great.  I don't see this as a heavy meal and we loved it.  I will make these again.  I may even give up making manicotti....who needs the pasta?  Feel free to add chopped fresh (or frozen, squeezed dry) spinach to the mixture.  Add some garlic toast and you have a complete meal.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was divine! I made it gluten free by using about 1/4 cup more of my regular gluten free flour mix plus adding about 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum. The dough was best after I let it "set up" for about 10 minutes and then was very easy to work with. I made a few other substitutions to account for what I had in my kitchen. I used dry basil and did not have fresh mozz so omitted it (I will be sure to have it on hand next time- I bet it would be DELICIOUS!) and just sprinkled on some shredded parm. I also used crushed tomatoes rather than diced for the sauce and added 1/4 cup of sugar as per my normal red sauce recipe (I like a sweeter sauce). 

This recipe was absolutely fabulous, my kids gobbled it up and asked for seconds (and then thirds! so much for left overs...), and it was seriously easy to make. Big, huge thumbs up!

I thought this recipe was great.  I was impatient and didn't drain the ricotta, but it turned out fine.  Next time though, I will try draining.  I finally was able to use my "gnocchi board" that I bought from King Arthur Flour.  While slightly time consuming, my gnocchi turned out very professional looking.  I used my regular sauce recipe.  Everyone raved how delicious the meal was. Edit:  the last few times I've made this, I used 00 flour.  I think it made a real difference in the texture of the gnocchi.  They were much lighter.

These were incredible! The reason I gave 4 stars, though, is because I did follow others advice and used hlaf the amt of pepper. I used the full tsp of garlic powder and feel it was too overpowering (and I am a garlic lover). Next time I will cut it in half too. I wanted to let others know as well that I didn't have fresh parm on hand so I used the kind in a shaker,it was a parm/romano blend and it turned out perfectly fine!

MOLTO BENE!! Very good! I didn't use the garlic powder or pepper in the dough and had to use more flour than called for ... these were delcious! (making fresh gnocchi is hard to call for an exact measurement of flour, size of eggs will contribute to this too). I am only rating the gnocchi because I made my own sauce. I had froze them when I first made them and had no problem cooking them straight from the freezer. Beautiful little pillows of soft dough. Love the recipe!

Very nice recipe. I did not make the sauce portion of this recipe.  Just the gnocchi.  I followed the direction of draining the ricotta in a strainer but after about 30 minutes there wasn't much liquid that came out so I'm not sure that this step is completely necessary.  I used skim milk ricotta to cut back on fat and it didn't affect the flavor at all.  I say cut back on calories & fat  when you can !  Very easy recipe to follow.  Much easier than potato gnocchi.  Will try again. Thanks.

I use a 1 tablespoon sized "cookie" scoop instead of rolling into a rope, then press with a fork. Must faster.

Made this for my BFF, 88 year old Italian Uncle.  Ricotta Gnocchi was his favorite meal that his mother used to make for him.  He hadn't had it since she passed away in 1987 & told me several times about it.  Last night I made him this recipe and he LOVED it!  I overheard him telling my brother-in-law that "they were just like Mom's; no kidding!"  So I thank you!  :)

Fabulous recipe.  I used my own sauce but made the gnocchi exactly as stated in the recipe.  Loved it!    I'll be making these often.

***GREAT FOR KIDS***  The dough was fun and easy and lots of playing went on in my kitchen.  I thought it was fast , easy, and just enough MESS for kids to stay busy, but not too much mess for mom.  THANK YOU!

This rating is for the gnocchi only...Very Good! After reading the reviews, I opted to use a 15oz. container of ricoota, which I drained for about an hour, 1 egg, all the seasonings, except the black pepper, and roughly about 2 cups flour. The dough was very easy to work with and I got these done in no time (I used a gnocchi paddle to get the lines on them). I froze them in a single layer on flour coated waxed paper and once frozen, I put them into a freezer bag and just put them back into the freezer until I needed them. I cooked these from frozen, and had no problems at all. I served them with my own homemade sauce. Everyone raved over them and I will definately be using this recipe from now on! I found these way easier and less time consuming to make than the potato gnocchi and they were better, IMO. Thanks for sharing. :)

These got 2 thumbs up from Mr. LTH!  He complimented the meal (these covered w/home made sauce and my Meatball Nirvana) multiple times.  As I'd just made a batch of sauce for my meatballs, I did NOT use this sauce, just the gnocchi.  This was a super easy & tasty way to use up leftover ricotta cheese from an earlier lasagna.  I did add more flour to make the dough less sticky and manageable.  This made a ton (I had enough ricotta to make 1 1/2 batches), so I froze most for an easy future meal.  TY for a fantastic recipe!

Love these so much.  A little time consuming so make lots to freeze and use at your leisure.  Will never eat another potato gnocchi again.

I am eating this right now and I am pretty happy!!  I added a few cloves of mashed garlic to the dough- won't use garlic powder.   The dough could have used some more salt..  in my mouth, they start out doughy but then a cooler texture is revealed with more chews :)    I made my own sauce out of a sauteed onion and like 6 huge cloves of garlic, with a sprinkle of cayenne and then threw in a jar of roasted garlic sauce.. I really like the onions in it!!

The key to this recipe lies in how you prepare the gnocchi.  Once you get enough flour into the dough (I used 1.25 cups), be sure to roll the gnocchi out in small batches on a very well-floured surface. If you use enough flour on the board and on your hands, what seems like mushy dough will quickly come together.  This is easy and delicious!

Very good and very easy.  Only made the gnocchi (not the sauce).  Doubled the recipe and froze half.  Had to boil for more like 5 minutes for it to be cooked through, but came out great.  One thing - I don't think this recipe serves 5.  We had 4 people and they were small servings...next time I'd make more for 4 people.

Can I just say that I now LOVE to make gnocchi? It was so fun to put together and what made it even better was that it froze so well. I just put them on a sheet tray to freeze for 20 minutes before popping them in a bag and today dinner took 2 minutes - doesn't get much better than that! This was my family's first time eating gnocchi and I have to say it won't be the last (:

Sorry, if that is a gnocchi, I haven't been missing out. There is no flavor, like eating a piece of dough. It helped when I cut up sausage and the cheese chunks with sauce.

Great recipe.  My grandma, who is Italian, makes potato gnocchi and I have always loved them.  I have never tried to make them myself because they seem to take so much time.  This recipe was so quick and easy and really very good.  I will make these again and again!

It seems it's been awhile since I've found a recipe that really got me excited... this was SO quick and easy, I was trying to come up with a backup plan in case the gnocchi didn't work... but I didn't need to. This recipe delivered. The gnocchi came together in about 5 minutes or less. My tip would be to check the gnocchi after it floats, as mine needed another minute or two to cook. Also, make sure you use a good quality garlic powder or the flavor may be too harsh for these delicate puffs.  --The sauce was simple and flavorful; I added some leftover mushrooms and onions I had sauteed yesterday. I LOVED the fresh mozzarella in this!! I have a log of it to use up, so I was excited to try it in this dish... so pretty and gooey and yummy! I cannot say enough good things about this dish :)

Wow!  Delicious and easy to make.  I made the gnocchi recipe as written except it needed more flour at the end, and I doubled it--s glad I did because we gobbled it up!  This sauce looks good, but I served it with aglio e olio so it wouldn't mask the flavor of the gnocchi.  My husband couldn't get enough!

Good grief- this recipe is easy and absolutely delicious.  I made as an appetizer for a small party of friends and we loved how soft and 'pillowy' these bits were.  The tomato sauce is the perfect accompaniment.

You'll like this if you are a ricotta fan. Me, not so
much. I had plenty of ricotta left from making lasagna so that's why I chose this recipe as an appetizer. I really had fun making this with my husband an it was so easy. I didn't pair it with the sauce because I already had a bolognese sauce ready for use.

Very good!   I doubled this recipe (to use the whole 16 oz container) and we immediately ate 1/3 of it and froze the rest on a cookie sheet and then put in a ziploc bag. It was then easy to use the frozen gnocchi in tomato soup or saute with a Gorgonzola cream sauce.   I did not try the sauce as listed in the recipe.

My Mom and grandmother are off the boat Italian and I grew up eating home made Gnocchi. This recipe is it! I followed it step by step the way it was written and tad ah, my Nonna's Gnocchi. Those of you with Italian Nonna;s know that they do not write down a recipe, so thank you for writing this one down, it is perfect.

Delicous!  My husband really liked them, the kids loved them and my mom gave two thumbs up.  I made the recipe pretty much as is but added some basil to the gnocci, used slightly less pepper and used shredded mozzerella and basil spice (not real leaves) for the sauce.  The only thing I will say though is that the recipe would need to be doubled if you were feeding more than 4 people and this was the main meal.  I can't imagine the recipe as is serving 5 like it says.  I doubled and it fed 6 with two being children.  I also think the sauce needs to be doubled even just for the recipe as it is, so we could have used probably 3 time the amount.  I did drain the ricotta so the amount of flour called for in the recipe was just fine.  Next time I will absolutely make more to freeze for later use!  We'll also be adding some italian sausage and make some asparagus to help balance it out.

I have never made gnocchi or any similar from scratch, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I think I could have used a little more flour in the dough as it was hard to make the "ropes".  (Eventually I got them where they were all fairly uniform.)  The sauce was super easy and it actually went really well with the gnocchi - had the heaviness balanced out with a lighter sauce.  Not sure if it was my favorite sauce, but it worked with this.  May just sprinkle some mozzarella over top next time, instead of using the cubes.  The only change I made was using garlic salt in place of the garlic powder (didn't have) and so I elimated the salt as well.  It was much better than I expected it to be and will likely make again.

This was wonderful! I did not use the included sauce, I made my usual fresh sauce, but added a little cinnamon to it. It went really well with the ricotta of the gnocchi. My kids loved it too. I did have to add almost an entire cup extra flour to make it workable, but it was still really fast and satisfying. Thanks, shelbi lynn!

**UPDATE*** Here is the kicker that made these out of this world--after they were cooked I browned them in 1-2 TBS of butter and it made everything so much better--texture, taste, etc! I highly recommend this!! ---Original review---> Excellent Gnocchi!! I doubled the recipe to use a 15 oz container of ricotta cheese and froze half. To cook from frozen I simply put the frozen gnocchi right into the boiling water and cook until they float +2 minutes. Be sure to use a nonstick pot or spray some Pam in the water or else your gnocchi will stick to the bottom and not pop up! DEFINITELY a make again meal! :)

Man this was good. Was a major hit at the dinner table. It was very easy to make as well. I did not use the recipe for the sauce, as I had some homemade pesto sauce I wanted to use up. Next time, I will at LEAST double the recipe, as there wasn't any leftover (and there were 3 of us eating.) Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

I have never had nor made gnocchi. This actually was easy - a bit messy with the flour and time consuming but easy! It was great. I just added some Italian seasoning to the mix and used my own bolognese sauce which paired up with the gnocchi perfectly. I recommend everyone pair it up with a meaty sauce. Even the BF liked it and he was a skeptic. Thanks so much!!

**Rating for Gnocchi Only**This was my first time making homemade gnocchi. It was good, easy to make and filling! I had some ricotta left over and was looking for a way to use it up when I found this recipe. I had to add about 1/4 cup more flour. I also didn't have fresh parm so I used the parm in the can and it was still great. Thanks for the great recipe. Will make again and try the sauce too.

I too used a larger container of Ricotta...oops! Should have read the label.  I just added a little more flour and kept everything else the same. I love garlic. How easy this was. My first time making Gnocchi and it was so awesome.  I have never made a recipe from scratch that was so easy and fast for a MEAL.  The sauce was wonderful as well. I hope everone tries this recipe.  It is super, thanks for submitting it:) Next time I will double and try freezing some.

I had high hopes but was not real crazy about this.  I doubled the recipe for the gnocchi and used my own sauce.  I couldn't taste the gnocchi, they were just bland dumplings in sauce.  Kids and DH liked it but I won't go to the trouble to make these again.

I'm told this is delicious by family. I can't have because of diabetes (those carbs in the flour unfortunately aren't what I can have). You do have to be careful with the flour. It's easy to make it to heavy with too much flour. Light is the key word. Handle lightly.

It was pretty good.  Kids liked it as well.  I feel like there could have been a little more flavor to the gnocchi itself.  Maybe add some more seasonings or something next time.  All in all, we enjoyed it.  Did take an awful long time to prepare however.

This is our favorite dinner! It's quick and easy, and delicious! I altered the recipe a little by blending the wet ingredients with spinach leaves and basil to make the gnocchi green in color, which looks awesome with the red tomatoes and white goat cheese I garnish the dish with.

At last a recipe that is really Italian. The gnocchi was absolutely delicious and this is true Italian sauce without oregano.  It is how I was taught by my Italian grandparents.Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Made just the Gnocchi. I drained the ricotta cheese and used only one large egg. These were so easy to make and ALL the children asked for seconds. I dropped them in boiling water in small amounts then I added them to the hot vegetable beef soup I'd made. I simmered them for about 5 more minutes and they were fantastic. My 7yo asked if we could have them again tomorrow night :O) Thanks so much Shelbi!

Everything was great except that one to two minutes of cooking time was too short! My gnocchi turned out half cooked, even though they had floated to the surface. I suggest at least five minutes of cooking time.

For whatever reason, I did not expect these to be this good.  I didn't use the sauce so I'm not commenting on that, but the gnocchi themselves are wonderful.  I had to add about another half cup of flour (and I didn't drain the ricotta because I used a brand that definitely had no additional water) and boiled them from about a minute.  Really quite amazing.

As far as I"m concerned it was pretty good gnocchi. Unfortunatly it required almost double the flour called for in the recipe before it was useable. And the sauce was excellent

I didn't make the sauce, only the little dumplings, but I was very, very happy with how they turned out, and pleasantly surprised at how easy they were to make.  I sprinkled a cutting board with flour and spooned about a handful of the dough on and rolled small batches, then tossed the dumplings into a bowl with a little more flour and tossed them around a bit to make sure they were coated so they wouldn't stick to each other.  Cooked for about three minutes and used a jarred sauce; delicious and filling!

This recipe is fabulous!  It is easy and quick to prepare.  It is the absolute best gnocchi I have ever made. Because I am always looking for shortcuts, I snipped 1" pieces with a scissors instead of a knife.  It worked great.

This was quite good. The gnocchi dough was very sticky and difficult to work with, but the results were better than store bought gnocchi. There was not quite enough sauce though. I will use this recipe to make gnocchi and try it with other sauces.

I can only rate the gnocchi part since I used my own sauce.  This is the first time I've ever had gnocchi, much less  tried to make it and they turned out really good.  My picky hubby and kiddos said the recipe was a "keeper but needs tweaking."  I think next time I'll use this as a guide and experiment a bit.

The gnocchi was tasty and I followed the recipe exactly as written, no changes needed.  As another reviewer stated, the dough is a little wet but once you turn in onto the floured surface, it is perfectly easy to work with...there is no need to add add'l flour.  The sauce is one of my favorites...I make a similar one very frequently.  The reason for the 4 stars is I didn't care for the gnocchi and sauce together.  Next time I will use a different sauce.

I agree with many other reviewers, boiling the gnocchi for as many as 10 minutes was just fine. Actually, the more well done they are, the more the flavors of the gnocchi came to the fore-front. i actually rolled them into balls instead of just cutting and boiling. If you do do this i would suggest making them the size of large peas or perhaps the size of garbanzo beans, because they increase in size as they cook. The sauce was amazing! though i made the mistake of letting the mozzarella melt too much and had a cheesy mess. i didn't matter, the flavor was fantastic anyway. If i could give this 6 stars i would..

I found that I over did it on adding more flour to bring it to more of a dough stage, but even so my family all really enjoyed it.  I made a garlic, mushroom, butter sauce that really went well with this gnocchi.  I will definitely be making it again, but will be more careful about not adding too much flour.

I made these tonight. They were good, not great. I prefer the potatoe ones. Considering the amount of time I spent fixing them versus the mess it made with the flour, I will continue buying the store bought ones.

absolutely delicious! I just used store bought tomato basil pasta sauce instead of making a sauce for the gnocchi. Tasted store bought! 5 stars even after using a different sauce. Will make again for sure and i have passed this on to friends already!

I am only rating the gnocchi as I did not make the sauce.  This was my first attempt at gnocchi and I considered it a success.  The dough was quick to put together and although a bit sticky, rolled out without too much difficulty.  Based on other reviewers' notes, I made a number of modifications which based on personal taste, but I don't think these affected the texture too much.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of white in the dough plus about a tablespoon's worth of flour in the rolling out process.  I reduced the parmesan to only about 2 tbsp and used low fat ricotta.  I also reduced the pepper to 1/2 tsp and omitted the garlic powder.  I placed the cut pieces on a wax sheet in the fridge until ready to use and they came off quite easily.  As some other reviewers suggested I cooked the gnocchi slightly longer, about 4 minutes.  For the sauce, I sauteed 1/2 clove fresh garlic, 3 ounces of goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil, and baby spinach and served on top of the fresh gnocchi.  It was a filling dinner for four of us.  I will try this again with different sauces.

I only made the gnocchi (cheated with bottled sauce) but I really enjoyed it! Very easy to make and the taste of the ricotta was a nice change from just potato. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have never eaten gnocchi much less made it before when I decided to try this recipe, so that should tell you how easy it it...it came out great! I used sauce from a can, grated cheese and powdered parmesan too so that should tell you how beginner-friendly it is. I used probably at least 1.5-2 cups of flour to make the dough rollable though. Delicious recipe!

Excellent!!  Note, the ricotta mixture was very salty to the taste, but once you add the flour and cook it, they are perfect.  I froze mine and they only took about 4-5 minutes to cook.  I doubled the recipe and used my own marinara because i already had it made.

Excellent recipe!  Had to add a little more flour to gnocchi dough for it to be firm enough to roll.  Only boiled gnocchi until it floated based on other reviews, this timing was perfect.  Gnocchi was the right texture, not chewing or dry at all.  Added 1.5 tsp sugar to sauce as it was a little acidic.  Turned out perfect.   Added mozz. cheese to sauce just before serving to avoid it melting, worked like a charm!  Husband LOVED it... it's a keeper!

The recipe came out a lot better than I thought it would - - couldn't stop eating it!  I added a sprinkle or two of sugar to the sauce.  Next time might add some sauteed shrimp or some mini meatballs.  Will definitely make this one again...tasted like something from a fancy Italian restaurant. - Thanks!

This tasted pretty good - but I am sorry, the directions NEED to state to drain the ricotta before mixing it up - otherwise you have to add too much flour. It is a vital part of the recipe and is not even included in the directions or ingredients.

These were amazing!  I did double everything except the flour(I used 3/4 of a cup) and I used a low carb flour instead.  They still rolled out easily on a silicone mat with a little extra of the Carbalose flour.  I also used just a few passes on a grater of fresh nutmeg.   I stuck them in the freezer while I made the sauce (which is exactly the same my own marinara recipe).  I did not have any problem with them falling apart but mine were cold when I dropped them into the the  barely boiling water.  I did them in 3 batches, I did not stir them and just scooped them out and into a strainer when done.  They started to float at about 1 1/2 mins but they were too soft.  I left them in for exactly 3 minutes and they were perfect.  They were not heavy at all.   It took me about 45 minutes from start to finish and it was the 1st time I ever made them. The only problem is they were sooo good that my son and I ate most of the double batch in one meal!!!

We love gnocchi! My grandmother used to make them but didnt add salt, pepper and garlic powder to them. I will be making these again. I did not use the sauce portion of the recipe b/c I make my own sauce from fresh tomatoes.

I sort of made this tonight. I used whole wheat flour for dietary reasons and served with alfredo sauce, as we can't have tomatoes. I think I ended up using more flour than I should have, as the gnocchi was a little bland. I think that was my fault and I didn't use enough parmesan. I also had to cook them a lot longer than 1 to 2 minutes, but again, I think that was the wheat flour. I'll definitely try this again though, and it WAS super easy and didn't really take that long.

(rating is for the gnocchi only) These were fantastic!  I've never made gnocchi before and they turned out perfect!  I made a double batch because I knew they were going to be a hit at my house.  Ended up adding 1/2 cup flour to the dough and liberally applied flour on my countertop for rolling it out.  I can't wait to make this again and experiment with different sauces!

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly and if you found it wasn't that tasty, it's because you didn't use the right ricotta, it makes ALL the difference.  I also added a little tomato paste to the sauce because it was a bit thin for me, but it def wasn't necessary.  Super easy too, bonus!

This was excellent!  Potato gnocchi is very difficult to make, but this was so easy and so delicious!  I did nake a couple of changes...for the gnocchi, I used garlic salt rather than garlic powder and I added more parmesan than it called for.  I think it made it taste much better and not at all bland.  Also, you have to boil the gnocchi for about 4-5 minutes.  For the sauce, I cut the oil in half, doubled the garlic (we really like garlic), added about a 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt, and I used shredded mozarella cheese instead of cubed (actually, it was a bag of Kraft Italian 5 cheese blend).  It was GREAT!

Excellent concept but mine did not turn out that flavorful. I would suggest more salt and more Parmesan, unless of course you prefer to let the sauce provide most of the flavor.

this gnocchi was really good.  i didn't make the sauce; i just used jarred sauce to save some time and some dirty dishes.  it took me a while to roll the gnocchi out, but it was my first time making them so i think with a little practice it won't take as long.  my husband, who loves gnocchi, says it was perfect.  my 8 year old and 16 month old couldn't get enough.  the baby cried when it was gone.  i recommend doubling the recipe, though, because even though i served it with italian sausage and sauce, there was barely enough for 2 adults, 1 kid, 1 baby, and 1 portion to save for my daughter's lunch tomorrow.

This was good but we thought it lacked pizazz.  Next time, I would increase the quantity of crushed red pepper and garlic and double the tomato portion of the sauce.

I have always been on the lookout for a ricotta gniocch recipe - just to know that they actually did exist outside of my grandmom's kitchen.  I have been making these since i was a child - granmom's recipe was always this "1 egg to 1 cup of ricotta and 1 cup of flour, plus some more flour"  and we would go from there.  She never called them Gnocchi, but Sugeets (i don't know if that is how she would spell it, but that's what it sounded like : ) )  I will try it with a bit of the garlic  - seems to be something i would enjoy.    I love ricotta Gnocchi SO MUCH BETTER than the potato!  thanks for sharing!

This recipe is no joke amazing, so delicious that I'm making it again tonight.  I needed about a half cup more flour than the recipe called for but you never know how the environment effects how much you use on any given day.  I omitted the garlic powder and tossed with roasted cauliflower and peas tossed in a touch of clarified butter.  Gnocchi this good should take days to make.  Best quick dinner EVER!

As a diabetic, regular gnocchi (made with flour and potatoes) is a big no-no.  So glad I stumbled upon this recipe.  It is soooo much better - much lighter than the original version.  Even my husband (who does not care for regular gnocchi) loved it!  
The only thing I did different was to add a little basil to the batter.
Oh, and by the way, I am 100% Sicilian - and very particular about my Italian food - so this 5-star rating is a real compliment!  Thanks for sharing!

These turned out better than expected. I added some dried basil to the dough and froze the gnocchi after forming. They were a bit gummy after boiling but I just finished them off in the pan with a bit of olive oil and they turned out great! I did not add mozzeralla to the sauce to save on calories but did add a bit of fresh basil and parmesan, I also used light ricotta. The taste was restaurant quality.

This pulled together pretty quickly, but I thought it was pretty bland.  Although it was eaten in its entirety and everyone said they liked it (wanted the recipe and for me to make it again), I just wasn't thrilled.  The gnocchi were fine alone, but I think the sauce needed some work.

I thought this was great.  I was looking for a way to use leftover ricotta and this was perfect.  I would add a little more salt, pepper and garlic to the dough next time since I needed to add more flour.  I also added zuchini to the sauce since we have had an overabundance of zuchini this summer and this wad the best my zuchini has turned out.  It was easy to make, too.

I didn't have time to make the Gnocchi so I used a store bought package. I did, however, use the recipe for the sauce and it turned out great. I cut back a little bit on the mozarella and added twice the amount of garlic. I served it with breadsticks.

Easy and wonderful!  Little pillows of pasta with a great fresh sauce. You don't need to handle it much. Roll in pieces and cut, press the tines of the fork into the pieces and if you would like to save for a couple of hours, put on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and cover with plastic wrap. Make sure you have plenty of boiling water. Done when they rise to the surface.

The Ricotta Gnocchi Recipe was very tasty, my family loved it.  This is a dish that my mother made when I was a child in Sicily.  It is enjoyed by many of the working class people of  southern Italy and Sicily.   I like it better than the Potato Gnocchi which the rich people in Roma and Milan eat.

This was absolutely fantastic. It was my first time making Gnocchi, and this is just made it all the more simple. I found that I had to add quite a bit more flour to form the right dough consistency, but other than that it was spot-on. All I really did was strain the Gnocchi, sear it off in a pan with some butter/olive oil to give it some nice color, then I mixed it in with the sauce, added cheese, and popped it in the broiler. Out came a nice, golden, plate of gnocchi. Great recipe. Good job.

I've never made gnocchi before and I followed this recipe exactly.  I really loved them and so did my family and husband who is always leery about something new.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because there wasn't enough sauce.  After the sauce was done cooking, there wasn't much there so I dumped about 8oz of tomato sauce in and added some basil and oregano and cooked it a bit longer.  Even still there really wasn't enough sauce for everyone to their liking.  I would definitely double the sauce recipe in the future.  Also, I'm a cheese lover - and one of those who never can get enough cheese, but I didn't even put all the mozzarella cubes in the sauce because there were so many.

This is a great recipe. My only tip is in adding the gnocchi to the boiling water. I wanted to add all of the gnocchi at the same time so they would all be done at the same time.  So, what I do is place the gnocchi on parchment paper. I then roll up the parchment (very loosely so you don't crush the gnocchi) and lower into the boiling water, holding one edge of the parchment so you don't scald your fingers.  They release immediately, and just pull the parchment out of the water.  Don't use wax paper because some of the wax will end up in the water and the paper tends to shred.  Works every time!

Amazing!  I always add more flour (and spices to compensate for the flour).  Another good addition is little cinnamon!

I felt that the sauce needed some tomato sauce or paste added to it. I also found I needed to made 5-6 ropes of dough, not 3-4. I also agree with another reviewer who stated she only put 4 oz of mozzarella in. I agree with that statement. Also, when adding the cheese to the sauce do it after you pull the pot off the stove and cooled for a min or two.  I also added Rosarita Italian Style Frozen Meatballs for a heartier dish.

Also, the gnocchi does need to cook 4-6 min in the water You can mix the dough in a food processor, so long as you use the dough blade.... best part is..... no flour being sent everywhere. Once done, then drain them immediately so the outside of the gnocchi could dry while finishing the sauce.

Five stars for the the gnocchi pasta recipe. I have actually never tried the sauce. But my family loves the gnocchi. Mine is always soft yet hearty. And always full of flavor. I definitely recommend freshly grated asiago.

I made the Ricotta Gnocchi tonight for dinner for my family. The gnocchi was very easy to put together, as was the gravy (red sauce). Although, with the gravy, I did add a small onion and a can of diced tomatoes. My twin 5 year old grandsons do not like gravy but do like Alfredo sauce. I doubled the recipe of the gnocchi because of doing one dish with gravy and another with the Alfredo. The gnocchi, I added about 5 tablespoons of flour before I put it in the fridge to rest for at least 15 minutes. It was perfect when I was ready to roll the logs of pasta before cutting it into its 1 inch pieces. It was very easy to cook, as it only took minutes to do so. I placed half of the gnocchi one bowl, and the other half in another bowl and then spooned the gravy into one bowl and Alfredo into the other.

My husband, our daughter, her husband had both dishes of the gnocchi, the twins only had it with the Alfredo, and I had it with the gravy. The gnocchi looked heavy like a dumpling after it was cooked, so I wasn't sure what it was going to be like... truly, I was anticipating a heavy gnocchi. But, to my surprise, it was very light! It was such a delightful surprise and an awesome and wonderful dish. Even my picky grandsons liked it. My step daughter wants me to fix it again. I sent all the leftovers home with her so that they can either get lunch or dinner out of the leftovers tomorrow.

If you've never made homemade pasta because you were afraid to, this is the recipe for you to try.

This had far too strong garlic flavor and needed a significant amount of additional flour to not be sticky.  I'll look for other recipes.

Made this for dinner tonight! Very fast, easy, and fun to make. The only difference is the sauce I make is my classic marinara. Which is pretty much the same recipe but I use a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes,  add a bay leaf, parsley,  italian seasoning,  and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Deffinetly making this again.  Will probably double the recipe next time.

Had high hopes for this recipe, out of six people no one liked the Gnocchi.  We all ate a little.  It wan't terrible but not worth the calories.
On the other hand sauce was fantastic but only used recipe as a guideline.
Will not make again.

Great and easy recipe. For the sauce, I left out the red pepper flakes because I didn't have any, I added 3Tbs butter, and I added about another Tbs of garlic. I will probably increase the amount of diced tomatoes next time because I loved the sauce. For the gnocchi, I ended up needing way more than 1c flour. All in all, it turned out great!

This was a very easy recipe. I am a convert from potatoe gnocchi as this is so much easier to make. The sauce was fine too, but really you can pair it with whatever you have on hand. My only negative comment is the fact that this is NOT 5 servings. This fed my husband and myself with soma sausage on the side. I guess if it was for a very small side dish. If you want to feed a family of 5 you need to double or triple this recipe.

I couldn't believe how easy this was, & hubs couldn't believe that I made it! Always wanted to try making homemade gnocci but used this recipe cuz I had some ricotta to use up. These cooked up quickly, were light, fluffy & tasted great. I didn't use the sauce cuz hubs makes his own so we always have it on hand. I also made a sage brown butter sauce which I preferred because it allowed the gnocci to be the star. Can't wait to impress somebody else with these!

This is the second time I've made gnocchi. I made some minor adaptations but for the most part, I followed the recipe exactly.

I would say this recipe is good, but not anything particularly great or special. Everyone liked it, but they didn't love it. As many other people have said, the sauce doesn't have very much flavor... we couldn't even taste the garlic.

I made this with jarred sauce that I doctored up to have the flavors of this one (and the cheese). We thought the gnocchi came out really well, tender and flavorful, if maybe a touch on the salty side, but that has to do with the cheese you use too and mine might've been salty. These are very simple to do and seem impressive when they're really not that difficult or time-consuming to do. Thanks for sharing!

I had some ricotta to use up and thought I would try this recipe. I have made gnocchi many times but never with ricotta. Ususally just eggs, my mom taught me this way. So I tried it and I must say I personally did not like them but my DH did. I found them difficult to make and tastreless . 4 stars only because DH liked them and he is not a pasta fan.

Reminded me of gnocchi frm my fave Italian Restaurant, and it was soooo easy. I omitted the garlic, used black pepper to taste...and I probably doubled the flour...im not sure how much I used bc I just kept adding until I could form a dough. I made ropes, and cut off little pieces with the side of my fork.

I boiled for abt 5 to 6 minutes, an added jarred sauce( i know i know!!) but  I have no time to make my own sauce. It was still delicious with some parm sprinkled on top

I made only the gnocchi and served it in a sage pesto along with roast chicken and sauteed broccoli.  A home run, for sure.

The only change was to use a clove of fresh garlic, pressed, in place of the garlic powder.  I did drain the ricotta overnight as suggested by another reviewer, but very little whey came out, so I don't know that it made much difference.

I made the gnocchi and used my own meat sauce. I wouldn't change a thing. They were little pillows of melt in your mouth goodness.

I made my own ricotta for this.  Was a fun recipe to make!  Needed to add a bit more flour so it was not sticky.  I also found it easier to roll out on a lightly oiled surface than the floured surface.  Family really enjoyed and we will make again!

I had fresh ricotta to use and decided to make this since I love gnocchi.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to make the "light, cloud-like" gnocchi every recipe site talks about, but I think that's my error.  I used jarred sauce.

This recipe was the first time I ever made gnocchi from scratch. I couldn't believe how easy these gnocchi are to make. The dough came together easily. The cooked gnocchi had a great texture. The 2 of us ate the whole batch! The sauce was really good, too. I definitely will make these again.

I thought these ended up way too dense. Perhaps I just don't have the knack for making gnocchi, but I think I'm going to leave it to the professionals :(

Everyone in my house loved this recipe! It took a long time to roll out the gnocchi, so next time, I will make those in advance. Also, I think I'll add some ricotta cheese to the tomato sauce, and maybe more tomatoes as well. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

This was incredible! I switched out about 3/4 cup of white flour for whole wheat with wonderful results! I also rolled the gnocchi down the tines of a fork, mostly for the "gnocchi effect." It was a little time consuming, but hey, what the heck! My hubby loved it because, unlike most red sauces, there are no onions in the recipe. I have already shared this recipe with friends and will surely make again! Oh, and serve with a salad. It lightens the dish and is refreshing between the bites of spicy gnocchi goodness.

I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 brown rice flour, but found the recipe to work really well. I doubled the recipe and froze half for later. They can be tossed straight from the freezer into boiling water until they float.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and I was terrified I had done something wrong!  Easier to make than I had anticipated.  I ended up not being able to cook them the day I made them so I kept them in the refrigerator until the next day.  They were a little heavy but I think that could be due to the fact that I didn't cook them right away or to overcooking slightly.  Not sure.  They were good but not spectacular.  Glad I gave them a try though.  Thanks

i never knew gnocchi could be so easy to make... and TASTY! i assumed it would come out gross but it was absolutely delicious. and im really proud i made it! definitely will make it again recipe was perfect the way it was didn't make any changes and it came out great!

**its ok to dump all of the gnocchi you made into the same pot of water it wont lump together like i thought it would and it was finished in about 4 mins!

My husband has been telling me for the last 4 years of our relationship that he doesnt like ricotta or dumplings. My theory is he hasnt tasted any of the allrecipes.com food before. I love pushing my boundaries and I HAD TO TRY THIS. So, I told him that mini dumplings were pizza crust boiled and he didnt even tasted the ricotta cheese in this recipe. Served him and minutes later, no food on the plate. He asked me to keep this recipe. I didnt say what it had in it, he didnt ask either. My kids were giggling. Thank you for sharing this great recipe and at the other hand, YAY ME :D

Made only the gnocchi (not the sauce) and it was great. Very filling and tasty. Boiled the gnocchi for 3-4 minutes instead of 1-2 and it was a good texture.

I followed this recipe to the "t" and it was a disaster.  Dense, chewy and tasteless.  I've made gnocchi before and it was light and fluffy - this one was not.  Sorry for the poor review, I just felt I had to share - wasted money on good ingredients.

Really fun to make! I enjoyed the process as much as the result. Unique and tasty dish. I just sprinkled a little mozzarella on top of the sauce instead mixing in chunks. Possibly even more delicious on the second day.

Made this with my 2 and 3 year olds.  We used the dough hook in my KitchenAid mixer.  Bit of an overkill, but they love using the mixer.  Did not drain the ricotta prior to making and added about a 1/2 cup extra during mixing.  It was very sticky & closer to cookie dough consistency, but the other reviewers are right.  Once it gets on to the floured surface it rolls and cuts just fine.  Boiled for well over 5 minutes & some fell apart a bit, but overall good flavor.  Both kids and hubby like it.  Will definitely try adding new flavors, perhaps pumpkin or squash to start.

I loved the gnocchi! They are so easy to make and delicious! I am not a huge fan of the tomato sauce, but I can easily use one that I do like with this recipe and it will still be great! Thanks for sharing!

After eating ricotta gnocchi in a restaurant for the first time, I wanted to learn how to make it.  Surprisingly it was really easy to make.  This one is a winner in my household. You may run into difficulty initially working with the dough, but got the hang of it and was making perfectly sized pieces halfway through. Just have a little flour ready within reach if you are having difficulty.  Next time i'll try scooping dough individually to see if that's even easier.  I was able to freeze half my batch and they tasted good several days later.   The sauce was very easy and worked well with the gnocchi.  I'll never buy canned sauce again. I look forward to trying to customize the recipe by adding dried herbs to the dough and trying it with different sauces.

This is a great starter recipe for Gnocchi. Extremely easy to make. 

When you mix all the ingredients in for the gnocchi dough, you might find the dough too wet and hard to handle. There is no need to add too much flour. When the dough is rolled on the floured surface, the dough will become be much easier to handle. The gnocchi turned out pretty good. It is slightly bland for me, but my husband loved it. 

The pasta sauce is a basic pasta sauce. For someone who is looking for a more refined taste, you might want to use your own pasta sauce. 

Overall, a great recipe for someone looking for a simple and quick homemade gnocchi.

These gnocchi were incredible. They were easy to put together and absolutely delicious.  I did make a double batch-as written it doesn't make that much-or at least it wouldn't have here as we have 2 sons that can eat a lot!  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful (and easy) recipe.

Really, really good. I made these the other night, and as other reviewers suggested I dried out the ricotta in the fridge for about 30 minutes. I think next time I will double the recipe, because it just barely served 4 people...Im not sure if thats becuase I made the pasta pieces too big, or what, but it made just enough! Very good though, I will definetly be making again.

This is fantastic! I added a couple tablespoons of dried basil to the dough and froze a batch. Also, used 4 oz of smoked mozzarella in place of the regular, and subbed fresh tomatoes for the canned, since that was what I had available. Excellent recipe, thank you!!

Yum! We loved this! The sauce is so good that we've made it to have over other pastas as well. We never buy spaghetti sauce anymore - this is so quick and easy and fresh tasting!

I used the gnocchi recipe but made a different sauce (balsamic cream sauce from this site... delicious!) Great recipe for gnocchi, so easy, and so wonderful!

This was super easy and delicious! I had no idea gnocchi was so easy to make.  The garlic flavor was intense but perfect.  I needed more flour to get the right dough consistency, but I didn't drain my ricotta, like suggested.  We refrigerated the dough for 30 min before rolling into tubes.  The gnocchi almost double in size during the boiling time, so take that into account when cutting your pieces. I dropped gnocchi 1 by 1 into the water so they wouldn't stick together.  I boiled each batch for approx. 5 minutes after they floated to the surface to get the right taste/texture consistency. Otherwise they were too flour-y. Transfer gnocchi straight into your sauce to keep warm and moist while the rest of your gnocchi cook. I served this with Giada de Laurentiis's vodka cream sauce.

My first attempt at homemade gnocchi and it was fantastic!  So easy to make, even considering I made a double recipe because I needed to use up the ricotta.  I agree that the amount of mozzarella would have been too much for my liking, so I only put in about half the amount.  I also needed to doctor up the sauce with some oregano and other Italian spices.  Next time I'll cut down on the olive oil, as the full 3 tablespoons is not needed.  All in all, though, great recipe!  I will be making this for family, potluck parties, and even my very very picky Italian friends.

I only made the gnocchi and used my own sauce.  I made the gnocchi just like the recipe except I substituted Asiago Cheese in place of Parmesan.  AWESOME! So much easier than potato gnocchi and a big hit around my house.

I'd give this three and a half stars.  These were ok, but maybe I'm just not a gnocci person.  I think I prefer tortellini's.

I've never heard of or made gnocchi before but it looked good so I decided to give it a try. It wasn't hard to make but it was a bit time consuming. The only changes I made were using fresh garlic & adding less mozzarella cause it was wayyy too much! My husband & I both thought it was good but not great. We cooked it for 4-6 minutes because 1-2 wasn't enough & it was still a bit doughy. It was pretty good but neither of us absolutely loved it. If I were to make it again I would make the pasta even thinner than the recipe calls for. However it wasn't good enough in our opinion to put all the effort & time into making these so I probably won't have them again

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I decided very spontaneously to make this just as my husband was putting our chicken on the grill. The gnocchi were done about the same time as the chicken (less than 15 minutes). I sauced it with store-bought bruschetta instead of the sauce in the recipe just to save time, but next time I'll try the complete recipe. The gnocchi was excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

I used my own sauce recipe so I can't comment one way or the other on the sauce.  This recipe calls for WAYYY too much black pepper in the gnocchi, though. Use maybe a quarter of a teaspoon of black pepper and it will be way more palatable. I also added a dash of oregano to my gnocchi (and some shredded mozzarella since I was almost out of Parmesan). Overall, the gnocchi recipe is very good.

This recipe was awesome!  I decided to be a little creative and made it almost like a lasagna.  I pours some sauce on the borrom of a baking dish.  Then poured in half the Gnocchi, put some pepperoni on top and a few dollops of ricotta.  I did the process all over so it was two layers and baked it in the oven @ 350 for 15 minutes!!  It added a nice twist to an everyday meal.   Thanks for the great recipe, Shelbi!

I only made the gnocchi in this recipe, but it was very good.  I had to use quite a bit more flour even though I drained my ricotta for about an hour ahead of time.  Will try draining it longer next time.  Hopefully then I'll need less flour and they will be a little 'lighter'.  Definitely use half the amount of pepper!!

Lighter than potato gnocchi and more flavorful. I quadrupled this recipe (boy that was time consuming to roll and cut) and froze half.  I made as stated except a little less pepper and garlic to meet my kids standards.  To freeze I laid them out on single layer on parchment paper lined cookie sheet to initially freeze, then transferred to ziploc bag.  This avoided them sticking together.

So good fresh! I also froze these bc the reviews said they froze well...... thaw them carefully or they will disintegrate back into pure cheese!!!!!!!!! I learned the hard way (it still makes a good sauce tho, to make the best out of an oopsy).

My rating is purely based on the gnocchi, as I did not make the sauce.  Instead I made a pesto sauce, and that complimented the parmesan cheese flavor of the gnocchi quite nicely.  I look forward to making the gnocchi again when I have ricotta on hand!

I followed the recipe closely, my only change was putting in half the pepper.  The texture was not smooth, maybe as a result of using pre-shredded parm.  Taste was so-so.  Even with the smaller amount of pepper, my kids thought they were spicy.  Won't make again.

These were easy to make, but I did have to add quite a bit more flour to get the mix to the right consistancy.  I also added some dried basil and black pepper.  We enjoyed them, and I will likely make them again.

This recipe definitely needed some help.  I started out using just this recipe, and found that the consistency wasn't quite right.  I dug through and found my Grandma's not-so-traditional recipe for gnocci, made with potato flakes instead of riced potatoes.  I added some flakes, water, and flour which made the dough a lot less heavy.  The overall product wasn't too bad.  Loved the cheese, but took too long to get the right texture to the dough and then for them to cook all the way through.  Sticking to Grandma's recipe, even if it isn't the "traditional" gnocci recipe :D

This feels like a fancy meal and a less experienced cook could pull this together for company and not be disappointed.  This is easy, but due to doubling the dough a bit time consuming; just rolling all the pasta, cutting, and placing on cookie sheet for cooling is time consuming, but again not difficult at all. In a large (12 cup) food processor I combined, a 15 oz fat free ricotta and had to add 2 additional cups, for 3 total cups, of flour to bring the mixture together to form a dough. I didn't change any measurements but cheese and flour, and just doubling the cheese should not have required 2 extra cups of flour to end up w/a workable dough.  If I was making a single batch (the orig recipe here) I would start w/one egg and see how it came together.The sauce is fast.  I added the gnocchi right to the sauce pan(large skillet) after both the gnocchi and sauce had been cooked according to the instructions here and combined them.  Then we dished it to plates and added the baby mozzarella and hit it in the microwave for a minute. I've made this before where I'd added the cheese to the sauce and we ended up with clumps of cheese and gnocchi and didn't like those results.  This gets 4 stars because it's easy, tasty, and homemade.

I made this last night, there were a huge success with my family.   I expect that how much flour one uses literally depends on the ricotta cheese used.   I used TreStella and 3/4 c. flour worked about right.   One thing I remember that i hated about gnocchi is if there is too much flour they can be like lead bullets in your stomach, particularly those made with potato.

I needed to add more flour than called for in order for the gnocchi to be firm enough, yet it as still so tender and delicious.  I will make this again and again.

My hubby loved this recipe. Said it was the best he has ever had. We didn't think there was enough sauce, so the next time I will double that.  Very good.

Good recipe which was even better the next day.  We liked using our own sauce instead -- thought the one provided wasn't "saucy" enough.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This rating is for the gnocchi only. I did not make the sauce, but used a marinara I already had on hand. I followed the recipe to a "T". I had to add a good bit of extra flour to make the dough workable. I'm thinking two LARGE eggs may be too much moisture. But the recipe did state to add flour as needed, and that worked out well. The gnocchi were delicious, and I will definitely make them again.

These were really easy to make.  Not nearly as time consuming as I thought it would be. My family and I really enjoyed the taste of the pepper and garlic in them. The picture I took was before I added red sauce on them. Next time I might try brown butter sage sauce w/ the gnocchi.

The Gnocchi were OK, but I expected them to taste much cheesier.  They were not that different from regular.   The sauce was OK but nothing special.

I've always been intimidated at the thought of making an authentic Italian thing like gnocchi from scratch.  But this was very simple.  I wondered if I had added enough flour for the "soft dough..." I didn't want it to become too floury/dry, but it seemed like I added at least another 1/2 cup and it was still very sticky. But when I rolled it out on a floured surface it did roll out okay and I was able to cut it easiy. The only changes I made were: I halved the black pepper as suggested by another reviewer- I think I may use the whole amount next time and see for myself what I think.  Also, I didn't understand I was supposed to buy fresh mozzarella balls, so I only had shredded mozzarella.  It of course melted completely and made the sauce really cheesy.  My kids thought this was great (they all loved it), but I can imagine that having softened, not melted, chuncks of mozzarella would more suite my gown-up tastes. If you only have shredded mozzarella, I would sprinkle it on top of the dish after the gnocchi was in the servig bowl with the sauce poured over it.  Overall, it was very good...filling and tasty.  I did not serve anything else with it, but I think a simple salad woud be a nice, light side. I ony gave it a 4 b/c I resreve 5's for out of this world amazingly delicious and not too much trouble recipies.  I will make this again, for sure.

Well this was a first for me, I have never made Gnocchi before today. I have had them, my mother-in-law used to make them, from scratch. A recipe that came with her from Italy. I was nervous about my husband trying these and comparing them to "moms". I am happy to say, we really enjoyed them. He did make his own sauce. I made a few adjustments. I added extra garlic powder, onion powder, just a pinch of salt and a little less pepper then the recipe called for. This is a recipe that I will make again.I did have to cook the Gnocchi for about 3 minutes.

I've made gnocchi several times before but I have to say that this is a terrific recipe.  I needed to use a little more flour to make the dough workable. The results were very tasty.  I think the flavors of this gnocchi were spot on.  The dough was very easy to work with.  I actually used the 32oz of ricotta so I basically quadrupled the recipe. (That could be why I need more flour then what was called for.)  I was able to freeze the extra and I'm really looking forward to eating it again!!

Changed this up a bit by using two containers of ricotta, a little more flour of course and eliminated the eggs as I wanted a lighter gnocchi. This was my first attempt at making these from scratch, so I was a bit intimidated, but it really was very easy, however, time consuming. Well worth the effort tho as they were truly delicious. I didn't make the sauce, but used a sage and butter recipe also from this site. Fun to make and thank you so much!!

These were so delicious. I had these over six months ago and recently had a hankering for them! They are easy to make and I'd be willing to bet they'd freeze ok for a few days.

Excellent recipe! This is one of our favorite dishes from this site. I have made it several times before but this was the first time I added spinach on it. I added about 1/2 cup of frozen spinach (I guess I could have added more) and only 1 egg + 1 egg white. I always use my own homemade tomato sauce with this dish. Next time I will use whole wheat flour instead of white.

These were ok, but they did seem a little bland.  I did not have to add extra flour like some, so that wasn't the problem.  I also used my own homemade sauce.  I didn't expect them to be bursting with flavor, after all they are dumplings.  But they just tasted really plain.  But they were super easy and a great way to use up extra ricotta.  I think next time I will add some more salt and garlic, maybe some other seasonings as well.  Overall, they were just ok.

Finally found a wonderful gnocchi recipe!  Tried the potato kind and I just can't get them to be light and fluffy, these were much lighter and I love the subtle ricotta taste and the salt amount I thought was perfect.

I used the one cup of flour and put another half cup or so to roll out with, I ended up getting about a fist size full of dough and mostly just floured the outside enough to roll out very lightly, I then cut and pressed lightly with fork tines to make them look prettier.  Came out really well, I might try a different sauce next time, though this wasd wasn't bad and I love fresh mozarella.  The gnocchi itself was perfect.

Yummy! This was my first time making and even EATING gnocchi, but let me just say that this recipe was wonderful. It was so delicious I will definetly be making this again and again! And when the recipe says to put the mozzerella in just before serving-do it. Like SECONDS before cuz mine got all gooey and stringy. But still just fabulous!

Made this the other day using leftover ricotta from the Ricotta Eggplant Rolls recipe that I made from Allrecipes.  The only modification was that I had added chopped spinach.  The taste was lovely.  I served it with a white sauce and everyone loved it although said it was very filling.  Went great with the tomatoey ricotta eggplant.  I think this will be a regular on the menu.

I found this recipe by searching for a different way to use up my leftover ricotta.  I should say that I'm not generally a baker, so that plays into my experience.  I had to add 2c of flour to get the dough a consistency that i could roll it out.  As a result, my gnocchi were kind of dense and the flavor was bland.  But I don't know how I could have made the dough rollable without the additional flour.  Perhaps if I had drained the Ricotta as another reviewer wrote - I considered it, but my ricotta looked on the dry side, so I skipped it.  So, not a recipe I'll make again.

Fantastic!!!!  My wife and I ate gnocchi at an Italian rest. in North Jersey a few weeks ago and were trying to replicate since.  This recipe did it.  Really inpressed!  We did not use the sauce, but instead used the Puttanesca sauce from Giuseppe Morabito and it was one heck of a dish.  Thanks!!!!!

I was a little nervous about making this because I’m not a great cook but this was pretty easy.  I had to add more flour because the dough was too sticky.  I thought the sauce was way too cheesy.  Even though it said to wait until the cheese got soft and not melted, but the tine it was on the table, it had melted and made it difficult to dish out because of the cheese.  I would definitely make it again.

I followed the directions exactly. I didn't like the garlic powder in this recipe. That's all I could taste. no one in my family really liked it either. I would make it again without garlic salt, use fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned and add the cheese after plated. The cheese ended up in one big glob.

Made the gnocchi just as written, but used jarred sauce for simplicity.  Delicious! Gnocchi are quite sturdy. They don’t turn to mush & fall apart like potato gnocchi.

I’ve been making ricotta gnocchi for years and have had great success, but I usually wing it.  This recipe provides good guidelines for amounts of ingredients.  I don’t use the Parmesan, reduce the salt, and add parsley flakes to the mix.
The best suggestion I have is to make a large batch (I do 4 times this recipe in one sitting). Lay the gnocchi out on well floured cookie sheets, and freeze. Once frozen, it’s easy to bag it and store in freezer.

Easy and delicious for a meatless Monday meal. Boiled  the gnocchi in some salted water .  Left out the red pepper flakes and mozzarella cheese because I didn't feel the need for them in the recipe,  added a extra can of the diced tomatoes, a pinch of sugar  to offset the acidity of the tomatoes and added a bit of the cooking water to the sauce before add the gnocchi .

Make sure you use Raw milk if possible because you will boil it so it’s safe.  Not not use store bought milk if possible 
The milk I used was whole milk so I got a very creamy ricotta 
Made the best Manicotti!

Easy to make and a delicious option instead of making potato-based gnocchi. Much easier to work with and flawless in execution. Our gnocchi connoisseur guests had no idea it was only flour based.

Leave out the garlic salt. It is unnecessary and an additive that overwhelms the gnocchi. Garlic and onion salts are not nutritious. 

More important, your sauce should showcase the gnocchi not fight with it.

Double this recipe to serve 4-6 people.

I can finally make gnocchi.  I've tried it twice with potatoes and gave up.  Decided to try once more with ricotta.  The only change I made was a 15oz ricotta but that's because I wasn't paying attention and it didn't look like 15oz.  Increased the flour by 1/2 cup to account for the ricotta.  Otherwise, it was great.  I froze what I didn't use the same night.  Just had some tonight in the Italian Sausage and Ricotta Soup recipe from this sight.

Delicious! Such simple ingredients made plenty of pasta! The rolling out of the dough was pretty laborious, but for the amount it yielded and the yummy end result, it was worth it! I definitely would make this again (and again) and can see it being a go-to recipe!

I made the recipe for the gnocchi exactly as written minus the garlic.  I needed to add about a half cup more of flour than it called for to be able to roll them out. They cooked about 4 minutes. They are  very tasty and easy to make. I didn't make the sauce as I am using a pesto with them.

I added a lot more flour to the dough so I could handle it. For the sauce I just used a can of Barilla garlic and added the mozzarella. It was really good, but the gnocchi needs to be hot for it to test best.

I bought the fresh Gnocchi from Costco, but used the recipe for the sauce.  I added some mushrooms, cooking them in the pan before preparing the sauce.  (Taking them out of the pan before pouring the oil in, and then adding them back into the sauce after the tomatoes go in.)

Was going to try a pesto sauce but saw this recipe and how hearty it was - loved it.  i always put a little sauce on my pasta so it doesn't stick before serving.  but also looks better - not so bald/stark white.  
Yummy dish, you can't mess this up.  It was so easy to make!

I have made these a few of times and they have turned out so nice! I follow the recipe because I never had made gnocchi, other than this. I make my own sauce with great success using a variety of flavors...marinara, pesto or a sage butter... Even using skim ricotta this seems like a heavy meal, so I don't do it often. But yes, I will make it again!

These gnocchi were STELLAR. I'm knocking off one star for the fresh mozzarella in the sauce. It tasted great, but it made for very difficult eating. Next time I would leave that out or replace it with parm or something.

This was super.  I doubled the ricotta and spices. And added a small amount more of flour.  The sauce was nice but turned very bitter from the garlic.  I added a tbs of sugar and fixed it.  That fresh cheese makes a nice addition.  I’ll make it again.

I added a few more chili flakes to give it a little more kick and also a little more parmigiano.  This recipe is awesome and a lot easier to make than gnocchi with potatoes.  I've made it numerous times an everyone loves it.

Absolutely delicious! I made no changes to the gnocchi, and I used sauce from a jar since that’s what I had on hand. The gnocchi were flavorful and had great texture — and were SO much easier and quicker to make than the potato version. This will be my go-to gnocchi recipe.

This was my first time endeavoring to make gnocchi, and I'm pretty happy I tried.  Unfortunately, I ran out of white flour and had to use wheat flour, which gave the gnocchi a very, almost overwhelming, grainy flavor.  I still enjoyed the meal, especially because the super simple sauce is AMAZING! I will certainly try this again and be more careful next time to have all the ingredients I need! The balance of cheese and garlic is perfect!

I used a jarred sauce instead of the one provided in the recipe for ease so my review is specific to the gnocchi (actually gnudi is the correct name according to my research). The gnocchi would be five stars if it wasn’t so dense. I don’t know if its something I did wrong or just how its supposed to be but my wife, who love gnocchi and eats it every chance she has, saw that as the only negative.

I enjoyed this, but I don't think I'd make it again. I ended up using a lot more flour than it called for, and even after several extra cups the dough was still very sticky. They tasted fine, just not my favorite.

I made the recipe almost as is and it was delicious. The only change I made was a use a bigger can of tomatoes and more mozzerella cheese. It was fairly easy to make and it came out great! This is even easy enough to make as a weeknight meal ( I made it on a Wednesday after working all day).

This was delicious I added some fresh garlic to the Gnocchi and used my own homemade sauce. I found the Gnocchi a little soft for rolling but chose not to add any extra flour because I wanted the ricotta to shine.  My family really enjoyed.

So easy to make! Thanks for the recipe! I love the texture of these gnocchi, it has a nice "bounce" to them instead of a soft, chewy texture. Paired well with a meat sauce instead of the sauce above to cut out some of the cheese.

Gnocchis were amazing! Pretty easy to make, and the flavor was terrific. We didn't care for the sauce at all, though. Really salty. Next time, I'll use my own sauce.

This was my first time making gnocchi and it was actually really good! I followed the recipe but ended up needing more flour - a lot more! Like at least double what was in the recipe. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but it was really frustrating. I kept adding more and more flour and the dough was still sticking to my fingers. I almost gave us and threw everything out but I didn't have a back up plan for dinner lol. I was expecting it to taste terrible and extra heavy because of all the extra flour but it was actually quite delicious. If I do make this again I may use a stand mixer for the dough to make things a little easier.

*** I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I used shredded parmesan cheese and the second time I used grated like the recipe calls for. I found the shredded parmesan cheese made the gnocchi more cheesy and delicious.

Texture of the gnocchi was good with a firm bite yet not too dense or heavy. Tomato sauce was fine but I might try one of my own light sauces with it. Altogether it is a recipe I would keep for based on the texture and flavor of the dumplings.

One of the best things I've ever cooked, but it does take a lot of hands-on time. My only suggestion is to double or triple the recipe, as there are never enough leftovers.

This is the second gnocchi recipe I have made.  I didn't use the sauce, so I can't rate that one way or the other, but it sounds great!  I used a spinach basil pesto recipe I also found on allrecipes which was delicious.  The only thing I changed with the gnocchi was the cooking time.  My only other experience with making gnocchi, the directions said to cook for 4-5 minutes.  Those turned out well, so I decided to split the difference and cook these for 3 minutes, and they turned out great.

Easy and delicious.  I used a food processor and just pulsed it.  Super fast and fun.  I also roll my gnocchi on the bottom of a special bread basket my mom brought me back from Italy.  It's how she use to do it when we were growing up.  It gives the gnocchi nooks and crannies for the sauce, yum!   I only made the gnocchi since I already had some of my own home made sauce.

I'm not quite sure I'm a fan of gnocchi in general, but these were easy to make and tasted  pretty good!  Next time I'll leave out the pepper, as I didn't like it in the gnocchi (I do like pepper, though - weird!)  I did find that they really need to soak up some sauce, whatever kind you choose to serve with it, to be palatable. I served half with a mushroom, spinach, garlic white wine sauce, and I'm having the rest with my own marinara.  I will make these again, as it's nice to have a different type of "pasta" once in a while.

I prefer potato gnocchi as it is lighter but this is a nice change and the sauce is good especially if you substitute fresh sweet pepper for the dried flakes which are suggested in the recipe.

Delicious.  I bought fresh Ricotta from our Italian market and exactly 1 pound was perfect.  I also use semolina flour as it gives a golden color and more authentic taste.  Omit the garlic powder; it is not necessary at all.  Boiling is my preferred method of cooking.  So good with vodka sauce or pesto.

Simple and delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I bent the cut pieces over the side of a fork before cooking.  Will make again.

I had a larger container of ricotta, so I made two batches. In one I added 1 Tbl of fresh thyme, in the other 1 Tbl fresh basil. I adjusted the garlic powder to ~3/4 tsp (I love garlic, but pwdr can be a bit harsh) and that amount worked really well for my taste. I made my own sauce so I can't comment on that portion, but the gnocchi was wonderful. Especially with the addition of the herbs. It was fun having some bites taste of thyme and some of basil. I know I'll have a lot of fun trying other fresh herb combos in the future. Thank you for the recipe.
 
Btw, when I strained my ricotta, using cheese cloth for 6 hrs, maybe 1 tsp of liquid drained off. It probably depends on your brand. With the type I used I wont bother to strain it next time. I'll just pour off whats on the top and go with it as is. Oh, and I used gluten free flour with no trouble.

This recipe is great! So easy, and delicious! A big hit with my family... Including my 2 toddlers. I made the gnocchi with a sage/butter sauce and sautéed in a pan with the sauce after boiling. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

This was okay.  The dough was so super easy to work with and they looked beautiful.  However, the gnocchi were a tad bland and did not have the pillowy-soft texture I am used to with potato gnocchi.

Great recipe. Took less prep time than I thought it would and tastes great. Even my ten year old loved it! I did alter a few things though. I pinched pieces of dough and rolled in the palms of my hands instead of rolling and cutting as called for. I used only two tbsp. of the olive oil for the sauce, even though you could really use even less. I added a bit of canned sauce to the diced tomatoes to make it stretch a bit further and omitted the red pepper flakes (because I don't use them, but I'm sure it would have still tasted great). I will definitely double the recipe next time for leftovers.

Really good gnocchi!  Didn't use the sauce recipe.  I sautéed real garlic and added that to the dough, instead of powder, and used less pepper. I would say this recipe serves about 3, 4 tops as is.  These were so much better than a potato gnocchi I made previously.  I will be making this again!  Where has ricotta gnocchi been all my life?!

Very good tasting and very easy to make!!   Definitely going to make again.     Added just a bit more flour for easier handling.   Very light and airy in texture and full of flavor.   Simple sauce but very flavorful.   Did not change anything.

I made the gnocchi tonight, and I thought it was fantastic.  I heated up some fresh tomato sauce that I made in Sept and froze. Didn't have any fresh mozzarella, just used parmesan. I thought it was a very light pasta dish.  Since it was just my husband and myself I halved the recipe. Will definitely make this again and again. Thank you shelbi!

So much more flavor than potato gnocchi! I put 1/2 into chicken soup instead of noodles and it was a hit. The other half with sauce. This gnocchi doesn't need a whole lot of extra since it is so flavorful.

Gnocchi was very good. I used half the pepper recommended, as some suggested, and it seemed perfect. If I made it again I would probably just use a can of spaghetti sauce instead of making the sauce in the recipe. The sauce tasted good, but I used a bag of shredded mozzarella instead, because it is way cheaper, and it melted and made the sauce all stringy/clumpy.

I gave this 4 stars but my husband gave it 5+ so we compromised at 5! I made the Gnocchi and sauce pretty much exactly as the recipe calls for. I added a generous "dash" of red pepper and it was plenty spicy which was perfect for us. If you're considering skipping the mozzarella in the sauce, don't! It adds a nice touch to the dish. I am not a very experienced cook so making the Gnocchi from scratch was a little intimidating. I rolled out the first rope as instructed but it made too big of a mess. For the rest I just dropped small balls onto a floured surface and rolled each around a little. One step I did add was to pan sear the Gnocchi once it was boiled (I'd had it prepared this way at a restaurant and wanted to try and recreate it). The pan searing added just a little firmness which we loved! Overall this is a keeper!

This is a delicious and very simple gnocchi recipe.  I halved the recipe and used whole milk ricotta which I first drained.  I put the ricotta in a thin layer on top of 3 coffee filters, laid the filters inside a colander, and let it drain for about 20 minutes.  I didn't need any extra flour (perhaps because I strained the ricotta).  I would make this again but next time I will probably make it as a side rather than a whole dinner, since it is a heavy meal.

This is incredibly quick and easy but tastes like you spent a lot of time on it.
I did make a few changes...Instead of 1 cup all-purpose flour I added 2/3 cup potato flour and 1/3 cup all-purpose.  I think this really gave it a traditional gnocchi flavor without the work of cooking the potatoes.  I also added chopped bell peppers and a bit of sausage to the sauce while the garlic was cooking and dumped some red wine in with the tomatoes.  Really added an extra dimension to the flavors.  This is definitely something I will be making again when I need a quick week night meal.

I tried this recipe tonight. I really enjoyed it but I think I would like to add some spinach to the mix. I sometimes felt like they needed a little more but still very good. I will definately make them again. Made the sauce but added different spices, some sugar and some wine. It made the sauce very tasty.

This was the first time I've ever had gnocchi.  So maybe I'm just not used to the texture.

I must have done something wrong.  I wasn't impressed with these at all.  Dough was incredibly sticky and difficult to work with and had very little flavor.  I won't be making these again.

I only made the gnocchi - not the sauce.  I froze almost all of them as I was just trying to use up some leftover ricotta & already had a different meal planned.  These were so super easy to make - I did roll them on a fork to look more like traditional gnocchi but even that took minimal effort & time.  I'm looking forward to using these in a browned butter sauce or something (I don't like tomato sauce).  Will definitely use this recipe any time I need to use up ricotta cheese.

Absolutely fabulous and light too! Used butternut squash with sage butter for the sauce.
Easy too, but make sure you drain ricotta well(I used a coffee filter inside a mesh strainer)for over an hour in refrigerator before making the gnocchi.

Used 3 lbs ricotta, 11 Xtra large eggs, 2 cups parmesan.  Needed more than the 6 cups of flour the recipe would have called for.  Did not make the sauce, but used some of my own recipe.  Nice and light and the added garlic powder was a nice touch - I had never used in gnocchi recipes before.  I think these will be especially good with a gorgonzola sauce.

Great, easy recipe and they come out very light!! I made them with a fennel and sausage tomatoe sauce where I took the sausage out of the casing (more like a meat sauce) everyone loved them!! First time making my own gnocchi and it was a success, will not buy bought gnocchi anymore!! Thank you!

This is a 30 minute or less recipe that the whole family will love! Delicious and super easy! Start the sauce while making the gnocchi and dinner is done. 
My pepper sensitive daughter didn't like the 1/2 tsp I put in there so I'll eliminate that next time but otherwise it's a keeper.
Added 1/4 cup homemade alfredo sauce to the red sauce and pureed it a little. Really, only changes I made and it was excellent. Thank you Shelbi!

This was ok. I wasn't that wowed by the flavors, although the instructions are good and it was my first time making homemade Gnocchi. I think I want to try the traditional potato Gnocchi and then maybe I will try this recipe again.

My husband said it was the best italian dish I have every made.  I did have to use a considerable amout more of flour since the dough was so sticky.  I did not drain the ricotta cheese since it was not in the directions but in the description.  So it was overlooked.  Will try that trick next time.  The family wants me to make it monthly!

Very sophisticated looking but so easy! The only thing I changed was to have a bowl of Italian sausage on the side in case anybody wanted to sprinkle some on top (all but my vegetarian friend did). The taste was very good, better than anything I've had in 'authentic' Italian places, but with the cheeses being kind of pricey, not much cheaper than eating out. The dish only fed three people and the ingredients cost about $25 (and I already had the staples, so that's oly the meat and cheese). I served with Mozzarella Wedges, and dinner was a hit. If I make again will cut the Gnocchi smaller, my pieces were like an inch long and half an inch wide and deep so a pretty big mouthful. Keep in mind the sauce is not the paste you're probably used to if you use the canned spaghetti sauce, at least mine turned out pretty thin.

I made this last night for the first time and it came out great. Everyone who tried it said it was delicious. The only thing that didn't work so well was using the recommended amount of flour. The gnocchi comes out far too sticky. For the right texture, I had to use quite a bit more. I will definitely be making this again.

Not worth the mess it made in my kitchen. The flavor was ok, but not great. The gnocchi were not that special. I agree that it was a very heavy meal and gave me a bit of indigestion. I didn't enjoy the messy half melted chunks of fresh mozzarella. I won't make th is again.

It was my first attempt at gnocchi and it was very good, however I was not sure how the dough was suppose to feel as it was very sticky. I separated my batch and added extra flour to one to see the difference and other than they were a little more doughy there wasn't much more. I also added fresh mushrooms to my sauce pan and cooked them with the garlic before adding the tomatoes. I enjoyed this and I have lots of leftovers since I was only cooking for two! Next time I will scale it down a little but there will definately be a next time! Very good recipes!!

I made these delicious light fluffy pillows last night and they were a hit.  I drained the ricotta overnight in the fridge and they went together in 15 minutes tops!  I used my own sauce.  Use a light hand when mixing the dough and rolling them out and you'll be rewarded.

Thank you SO much for this recipe.  Everyone told me to keep this one close.

Oh...my...gosh?!  This was so delish!  My husband and I made it tonight and it was too good to be so easy!  Will definitely make it again.  The only thing I changed was that I doubled the sauce because my husband loves sauce.

this was excellent.  I didn't have ricotta so I used cottage cheese and had to use about 3 cups of flour to make a soft dough.  I then doubled the sauce to compensate, because I had a lot more gnocchi.  My family loved it and never missed or mentioned not having meat.  I'm slowly tricking them into a vegan lifestyle. So far, so good.

This recipe was easy and turned out a nice, light gnocchi.  The sauce, although simple, was very good with the pasta.  The fresh mozzarella, while tasty (I mean, who doesn't love the stuff??) was kind of out of place, though, IMO.  I will leave it out next time, and just top each pasta/sauce serving with a sprinkle of shredded mozz. or parm.  I think the gnocchi would pair well with any type of sauce, from pesto to browned butter to a rich cheese sauce, as well as the tomato sauce.  I'm thinking of trying a roasted red pepper sauce next time....yum!  Thanks for a really great and easy recipe!  My whole family really enjoyed it....it's going in my keeper file.

My husband and I love gnocchi but hate the store-bought stuff. We've made the potato gnocchi before and it is good, but this is even better. The sauce was amazing too. I only added a couple sprinkles of brown sugar to take care of the tartness of the tomatoes and added a few sprinkles of oregano. I don't usually think a recipe is amazing, but this one is for sure.

Simple, but very addictive! Loved these! Dough was more difficult than expected to roll out, but that's alright. Probably best only to make once in a while as a treat anyway; don't want my waistline to expand too much (more). :P

This was my first time making gnocchi and they turned out delicious!  I tried to roll the dough as the recipe specified, but I found it broke up too easily.  So I used the old-fashioned Italian method of taking a pinch of dough, rolling, and slightly pressing.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of black pepper instead of the full teaspoon.  I wasn't sure how the ricotta gnocchi would taste compared to potato gnocchi, but I think I liked them more.  The family loved them, and the hubby gave them two thumbs up!  I've bookmarked this recipe as I will be using it again and again!

the gnocchi was easy, quick, and delicious.  i used the lowest fat ricotta available and was pleased with the results.  i made my own sauce, so can't give a review on the sauce.

This was really great! 5 BIG STARS!
 Easy and great results! 
My husband was impressed that I made home made pasta. 
I've only ever had potato gnocchi and was never a big fan. I can now say that I'm a fan of ricotta gnocchi!
Knowing it can be heavy, I cooked 1/2 the dough, serving it was a couple TBLS of nice jarred pesto for the sauce and a big salad for the 2 of us.
I wrapped the other half of the dough in plastic wrap in the fridg to make later in the week. 
I'll try that with a simple red sauce.
Thank you for sharing this.

delicious as is. sauce is just okay. will probably serve with my own sauce or jar sauce. i could probably do 1/2 t salt or less. kids might like 1/2 t pepper, but i like the spice level at 1 t pepper.

This was my first attempt at making gnocchi.  The ricotta was a really good switch from the typical.   To make it a little easier, I didn't roll the dough out.  I cheated and simply spooned it out of the bowl and placed it on a floured plate.  To make them prettier I rounded them out a bit better after they got a little flour on them.  They took about 3 minutes to cook.  I didn't make the sauce, instead I made my own with italian tomatoes and pesto.  Delicious. I'll definitely make this again.

I normally don't rate recipes, but this was too good to not! It was so simple and turned out fantastic! The sauce is really what make it stand out, with the fresh mozzarella pieces. Instead of diced tomatoes I used stewed tomatoes and added a few bay leaves while it simmered. Then added the basil, a tish of salt and pepper and it was fantastic!

Both of my kids (almost 3 and 1) gobbled this up.  For the sauce, I left the mozzarella out all together, used seasoned diced tomatoes, left out the basil leaves (since there was basil in the tomatoes).  It was great and simple to make to boot!!

I rarely put reviews on here, but I just have to say this was the most delicious dinner. I've never made Gnocchi before and thought it might be a little too involved for an after work dinner, but decided to go ahead and make it anyway. Not only was this easy to make it wasn't too expensive either. I made the recipe exactly as written...it was a true winner and I'll definitely be making this meal a staple in our household.

This is my first review and I had to write and say how delicious this recipe is!  It was easy to make and so good.  I added some shredded asiago and romano in with the parmesan and it is wonderful. I have been cooking and baking for more years than I care to remember and this will definitely go in my favorites.  Don't skimp on the garlic.  I browned the gnocchi in olive oil and then put the sauce on...even better!   Thank you for the TREAT!!

I wouldn't call it easy (lots of manual labor on the rolling and cutting), but definitely delicious!

Delicious!  Everyone enjoyed it and I will definitely be making it again.  I used home canned tomatoes from last summer and the sauce was nice and bright tasting.  I did forget to let the ricotta drain so next time I'll be sure to do that.  This recipe makes just over 1 lb of gnocchi (19 oz)

I love this recipe! It was perfect just by following the recipe with no changes. I used canned sauce though, I did not make my own but the gnocchi were delicious!

I made the gnocchi. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. The gnocchi were too heavy. I enjoy gnocchi that melt in your mouth like the gnocchi you eat in Italy. I think maybe the flour I used was the incorrect flour. I will try this recipe again with a lighter flour since it really is easy and takes little time to make. It did take 4-5 mins for the gnocchi to float to the top. I'm not sure what the parmesan added to the taste since I didn't taste it, but I added it. I will say this gnocchi tasted like some the ones I've eaten at U.S. restaurants, but I don't order them again from those restaurants. I've only had really good gnocchi at 2 restaurants in the U.S. But in Italy, the gnocchi is fabulous. Update: These were much better 5 days later after they sat in the frige.

I usually love tradition gnocchi and this was good but I was hoping that it would taste more like ricotta cheese. It tasted like normal gnocchi. The only 2 things I changed was that I added ground beef to the sauce and I had to add an extra cup of flour to the dough. It is a bit of work but worth it!

While the sauce was amazing - very simple, delicate, yet full of flavor, the gnocchi came out heavy. Like little lumps of dough. I'm sure it was because it was my first time making them, and I might try again.

I won't rate this poorly given that I think I messed up on it. I doubled the recipe which made it liquidy and I had to add a ton of flour which made the gnocchi taste doughy. The sauce was wonderful, very nicely spiced. Next time, I will maybe only add 3 eggs if I'm doubling the recipe. My family seemed to like it but I also couldn't taste any of the ricotta flavor.

Ricotta dough was a little tough to control, but past that it was an easy recipe! Setting the ricotta in the fridge for 30 min to "dry" didn't seem to do anything to the consistency. Also, unless you are eating tiny bowls, it says 5 servings but it's more like 2.5. Sauce runs out before gnocci, so don't be afraid to make extra sauce! Delicious, and very professional looking!

Yummy!!! Easy to make and very tasty. I used garden tomatoes and this was great. I also added some sausage links (cut up) to make this a complete meal.

This was my first time making Gnocchi and it came out wonderful - so easy.  My family raved about it, so will definitely make it again.  I would give this recipe 5 stars for taste, but b/c of the sauce I only gave it 4.  I made the sauce per the directions, but the mozzarella made it turn into one big lump of goo.  It still tasted great, but next time I will have everyone dish this up and then sprinkle shredded mozzarella on individual servings so it doesn't end up a big melted lump.

Followed the recipes exactly (doubled) and these gnocchi were amazing! First time making pasta, too! They were much lighter (less dense) than potato gnocchi - which we all preferred. After reading some of the other reviews I was concerned about draining the ricotta - well I tried but virtually no liquid came out. I probably added a little additional flour to make the dough the right consistency- but not much. Te sauce was simple and the perfect with the accompaniment. Not to cheesy for my family's taste. A real winner and I'll definitely make again.

I did not use the sauce for this recipe but the gnocchi was WONDERFUL! I cooked them in boiling water until they floated. I made a double batch and they were gobbled up! Very tasty and filling. A little time consuming but worth it! Not to mention so much cheaper than buying them at the store.

Amazing. So simple and quick. Such a streamline recipe and extra salt was not needed in the sauce. Used a pipe of preformed basil instead of fresh basil due to availability, and still came out so fresh!  Thank you for the great recipe!

MMmm, these are QUITE good!! I was eating them straight out of the pot without any sauce. The ricotta flavor is delicate and wonderful... and easily covered up with the wrong sauce (if you choose to use another sauce). I was afraid to make gnocchi for the longest time simply b/c I thought it was complicated. IT WASN"T! Very simple and not labor intensive at all. I would make sure your 'ropes' are fairly thin otherwise you'll get major chunks of gnocchi. I'm making these again soon!

LOVE the gnocchi! i used chopped spring onion tops (the green part) instead of the garlic stuff due to availability. instead of the suggested sauce (which i'm sure tastes awsome, but i just didnt have time to make) i added a dab of butter, some chopped green olives, grated edam cheese and more green onion tops. ..makes one wanna eat more n more n more.. oh and the gnocchi freeze well once cooked. thanks loads for this recipe!

My review is just based on the gnocchi.  I wanted to like this, but I just couldn't. The bf really enjoyed it, though.  I actually made it twice.  The first time I made the gnocchi as is and I found it really salty & the Parmesan flavor was intense. The second time I used more flour - I think too much though. I served it with a tomato vodka cream sauce both times.

Flavor was good, but the texture (raw dough-like) wasn't to our liking. Okay, but not great.

Great dish, fun and easy to make.  I found the Ricotta to be a little lighter than a potato gnocchi.  This was nice becuase you can eat more!!!

The sauce had way too much cheese but was pretty flavorful. I don't know if i'll make the sauce again but the gniocchi was really good and would be yummy with any pasta sauce

Fabulous recipe! I like everyone else had to add more flour - but like anything that is dough like, you always have to work with the ratios of liquid to dry ingredients. I made them one night ,  refrigerated and then cooked the next night. Really nice flavour and texture. I served with a tomato sauce and meatballs and it was great. I found it to be a quick and easy recipe, I had the dough mixed up and the ricotta shaped in just over 10 minutes. Next time I will make double and there will be a next time! Thanks for sharing! Now I can impress my husband with homemade "knuckles"

I only made the gnocchi. I realized as I was making them that I didn't have any Parmesan cheese, so I left it out. I think it would add a lot. But it still tasted really good. :) I'll make it again.   I only used a cup of flour, and then turned it out on a well floured surface. If you don't overkneed it, that amount of flour is fine.

Oh wow!  This was so good.  The gnocchi itself was excellent.  The sauce was rich and delicious.  The fresh mozzarella (which currently is all the rage with me) put it over the top.  Yum!  I will make this again!  Also, mozzarella pearls are a time saver.  :)

I almost doubled the amount of flour that was given in the recipe, in order to make the dough not so sticky. Also, I felt that the parmezan was not tasted in the gnocchi. I will try it once again, with more parmezan. All in all it was OK, but maybe not suitable to my taste.

LOL!  I made this last night - kept having to add more flour, though, and was fussing about the recipe.  Then I checked the ricotta container - I had used the 14+ oz size!  It was just as well - I am not big fan of powdered garlic and it would have been overwhelming if I had used the right amount of ricotta.  Despite my mistake everyone loved the gnocchi, which I served with a vodka sauce.  Next time I will follow the recipe, but halve the garlic - or use fresh.

I only made the pasta, which I found needed much more than 1 cup of flour.  The dough was easy to make and I froze the intial product which we ate last night.  The flavor was good but the texture was rather gummy and loose, I added extra flour when I made it, not sure if they needed still more, I was reluctant to more than double the dry ingredients on a first go round.  I might try this again so I can have a special pasta recipe in my arsenal but I'm not sure it is worth it.  perhaps I just need to practice my pasta making skills!

Yum....this was delicious!  I cut back a bit on the garlic powder and the salt called for in the recipe, but other than that I didn't change a thing.....it was so easy to prepare!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The original recipe is a bit too garlicky for me (and I LOVE garlic) so when I made it again I cut it in half. I also added a little chopped spinach just to mix things up. Several people in my family have tried it since, and now even some of their friends are making it! It is a wonderful and easy recipe.

This was a solid recipe.  I liked the ease of using cheese instead of the process of preparing potatoes.  I will make again during the cold winter months as it's a dense, stick to your ribs meal.

I've never made pasta so I was a little nervous, but it was pretty easy!  It turned out to be super yummy too.  The simple sauce complimented the gnocchi perfectly.  The only difference I made was to add some fresh basil to the pasta dough as well as the sauce because we are basil lovers.  I can't wait to make this recipe for my uncle who adores gnocchi!

This was really good, though I think I would use my own sauce next time instead of using the one in this recipe. The texture was not the same as traditional potato gnocchi that I've had, this is more dense, but the flavor was really good. Very time consuming to make but a nice fancy meal.

I had to add a significant amount of flour which made them too doughy. If I try again, I will leave out the eggs to limit the liquidity of the dough. Also, I was not a fan of the parm taste, but that is individual.

I also needed to add a little more flour, but it should still be sticky because too much will create a bread-like consistency.  This is a great recipe though.  My husband loves it, company loves it, and it's fairly easy and inexpensive.

these are the BEST gnocchi ever. this is the first time i ever made home made gnocchi. it took me forever to make them, but they were worth it. when i make them again i think ill leave the black pepper out of gnocchi dough, i didnt like the way it looked.

This rating is for the gnocchi only, as I made my own sauce (although I did add the chunks of fresh provolone to the sauce which was very nice). I drained my ricotta cheese using cheesecloth first,after doing that the flour amount seemed fine. Used the full amount of salt and pepper, and fresh minced garlic instead of dried. The dough was easy to work with and the gnocchi was delicious!

This was great!  My boyfriend thought I had bought the gnocchi and just made the sauce.  It was my first time making anything like this, and it was so easy.  The dough was very sticky, and I had a little trouble getting it to roll at first, but finally got the hang of it.  I cut the amount of pepper in half since I don't like too much.  The sauce was amazing with just enough "ba-zing" to it!  Very garlicy, but that's the way we like it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have been looking for a good easy gnocchi recipe... and this is it!! As a young girl I used to help my mom make these homemade and it seemed like such a project. We made them with potatoe etc. However I work a full time job and wanted to make them for my family... but just never wanted to spend my entire day off with them.  This recipe is so... easy and they actually are very delicious.! I doubled the recipe and used part skim ricotta... ( which I am glad I did!) I made my own gravy or sauce as some call it with sausage... Even my husband who never liked the orig potatoe ones loved them and had two helpings and is taking the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!! My teenage son loved them also!! Thanx so much for sharing this recipe.... its good to get back some of my italian authenticity back in my home!

My family and I loved this dish.  I'm not italian and have never had gnocchi before, and was pleasantly surprised.  The sauce is especially yummy, I doubled it except for the mozzarella and it was perfect!

Yummers! A spur of the moment decision to make these and use them as dumplings in my homemade chicken soup turned out to be inspired! My family gobbled them up and demmanded more! I made the gnocchi with the full teaspoon of pepper and you could really taste it. I was surprised my 6-year old who doesn't like spicy things loved these but she did! Next time I will definitely double the recipe, cook them all and freeze half. Delish! I did cook them seperately from the soup - put about half at a time in gently boiling salted water, waited for them to float to the top (about 4-5 minutes), plucked them out with a slotted spoon and popped them into the chicken soup.Fantastic!

This recipe is a slam-dunk winner.  Quick and easy to prepare, and mouth-wateringly delicious.  Literally, it is heaven on a plate (or in a bowl, if you prefer!).  Only changes we made were fresh, finely minced garlic in the gnocchi dough (instead of garlic powder), and used part-skim instead of whole-milk ricotta.  For the diced tomatoes in the sauce, we used fire-roasted.  Added a nice flavor dimension to the sauce.  The dough came together beautifully and was a dream to work with.  I know the recipe says "serves 4", but my husband and I almost demolished the entire thing between the two of us with some homemade crusty baguette and a nice bottle of wine.  Just a teeny bit left for lunch tomorrow!  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  I also agree with the poster who said these would make great appetizers, individually skewered.  Nice idea!

Very good and very easy, and I have little experience making things from scratch!  Never have had gnocchi before but liked the cheese flavor.(used part skim and part whole milk ricotta).  They did take abt 3 minutes to boil.  I made extra everything and have frozen the leftovers.  Don't think I needed to dbl the olive oil for the sauce.  The sauce was a little too cheesy (and I love cheese).  Used the diced italian style tom, and added extra oreg/basil/garlic besides.  We will make this again!

This should be called "my first gnocci", since its simplicity attracts newcomers like myself. it was delicious and still something of a blank slate, so everyone should aler it as much as they please!  deserving of the email spotlight!

Really, really nice gnocchi - and what's more, sooo simple!  The sauce was good; but it's the gnochi that makes this; it is simply divine!  Here in Aust.; I've only ever come across potato gnocchi; and have tried to make it here at home; the cooking the potatoes; the drying it; racing the potatoes - this is soo much easier and in my opinion; tastier by far.  Had not changes other than ended up having to use Craft paresan (I know; wouldn't be as good as the real deal); but it still was absolutely wonderful.  Will absolutely make again!

I never had Gnocchi before so I wasn't really sure what to expect. It was very fun to prepare. I used light ricotta, and I did my own thing for the sauce. It is defiantly very filling.

The gnocchi are wonderful!  I passed on the sauce listed and tossed the gnocchi with a light pesto and some mozzarella instead.  Was a BIG hit at the dinner table! Definitely will make again!

This was so quick and easy.  Don't let the prep time deter you.  I discovered you can make the gnocchi from start to finish as you simmer the sauce.  This is definitely a 15-20 prep meal.  My whole family loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

My first attempt at gnocchi and it was a hit!! Next time I'll be sure to double the recipe and freeze some as it would make an exccellent fast family dinner for busy nights. All 3 kids liked it with a little butter on top, my husband and I inhaled ours with caesar salad and garlic bread. A new family favourite!

I've never made gnocchi and this was great first time out. I struggled a little with knowing when the dough was the right consistency. I think I used between 1/2 to 3/4 cup more flour. I made my own sauce and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Very nice.

I thought the gnocchi was very good; I doubled the recipe to have extra. I made the sauce as well, but didn't care for it. I will definitely make this again, using a different sauce.

This is excellent.  I made half the gnocchi last night, and rolled and cut half of it today.  It was much much easier to roll it today after being chilled in the fridge--didn't even need flour to roll it.  However, mine was incredibly sticky partly bc I failed to account for the fact that my ricotta container was a 15 oz container, not 8 oz.  Oops.  I did double the sauce (realized later I kinda doubled the recipe!), and am glad I did.  I liked it together--perfect light dinner with salad.  The only thing I would change next time is use shredded mozzarrella instead of fresh.  I like fresh, but shredded would cover more and I didn't really like the mozzarrella chunks throughout the pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy. I used part skim ricotta and it wasn't watery. I make up an extra batch and freeze it for later. Also, the sauce was good (yes, the cheese clumped together), but we use another marinara.

This is so easy to make and delicious too!  Only trouble I had was getting the dough not sticky enough to roll.  Instead I just rolled small balls between my hands.  The shapes were irregular but it still tasted great.

These are soooo good, but very filling, I used my own homemade sauce in place of the one provided. The only thing is you really got to flour your counter or they'll stick and make a huge mess.
