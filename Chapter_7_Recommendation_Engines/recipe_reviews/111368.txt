These were alright - I give them a 4 because the taste was there, it was just a little off IMO.  I think using refridgerated pizza dough cut to size would make these much better - as to me, the cresent roll taste was what threw it off to me.  I chose to saute the onions, peppers and mushrooms before adding it to the rest.  Will try again - only use the pizza dough in place.  Thanks!

It made twice the amount of filling that I needed.  Use two crescent roll tubes in stead of one, or use the remaining filler and add it to the pizza sauce.  I thought it was odd not sauteing the onions and mushrooms, and I also found it odd that no egg or tomato paste had been added as a binder.  I added one tsp of garlic.  You find yourself wanting to add more ingredients:  black olives for instance, some fresh basil.  But remember to use 2 tubes instead of one, because you'll have a lot of left-over filling.  It took 18 minutes to cook.  The flavor of the dough was bland.  It would be better if dusted with onion and garlic powder.  Powder, not salt.  These are salty enough.  It really needs the dipping sauce to add the tomatoey taste.  Excellent recipe but had to give it 4 stars for the "woulda coulda shoulda's"

I used the basic idea here and made mine with spinach instead of pepperoni.  But they were delicous!

We loved this.  I made them for my daughterâ€™s first birthday party and the whole family raved.  I mixed all the cheeses and then only added a little onion and diced pepperoni to it.  I also made them large by fusing all the dough together and then rolling it up and cutting it into 8 or 9 pieces.  Seriously delicious!

My son says it gets 4 1/2 stars, I say 4, because I think that you should mix up the cheese mixture set a little bit longer to meld the flavors together.  I left out the mushrooms as we don't like them and I added chopped up green olives. So I left out the salt too.  I also was in hurry and this was our dinner with a salad, so I just rolled the crescents out to a rectangle shape stuffed with mixture and rolled long way.  I made 10 large pinwheels.  Thank you we enjoyed this very much.

The family liked these!  I did press two rectangles together to make them a bit bigger since it was going to be a dinner dish.  I was worried the cresents wouldn't cook evenly and be soggy, but no problem there!  A definite repeat recipe!

I served these for a baby shower and then again for 4th of July.  What a hit! Everyone loves the yummy flavors.  It's so easy to substitute ingredients as well.  You can add olives or take out mushrooms...whatever your preference!  Highly recommended!

Everything went fine in preparing as given.  I really liked it better without the dipping sauce.  It is a very good appetizer or party food.  It was a bit too monotonous to be a main dish though.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it is easy and good for my nephews.  The taste is good, and it is fairly easy to make.  I used a asiago cheese when making them to give it more flavor.  Thanks.. will make again for the young ones

The kids and I loved this.  I used Pillsbury roll-out pizza crust.  It didn't roll very tightly.  Next time I'd make my own pizza dough.  But, I added fresh spinach and Italian sausage.  Total hit!!

These were absolutely scrumptious! :) I left out the mushrooms and forgot the italian seasoning, not a problem! I also accidentally rolled them the wrong way, so they turned out more like stuffed bread sticks, also not a problem! I sprinkled a little garlic salt and pepper on the top, YUMM! I did not saute the onion and pepper like everyone suggested; I cut both ingredients into small enough pieces that it didn't make a difference if they were sauted or not. GREAT RECIPE! Thanks! :)

Great recipe, easy, and perfect for kids!  I wouldn't say I'll never go back to regular calzones again because these are different and I love calzones, but they are great!  The crescent roll dough adds a slight bit of sweetness which mixes well with the pizza ingredients.  I will say that the onion is a strong flavor so if you aren't a big fan of onions it may be better to saute them first or omit them all together.  I LOVE onions so I was happy with the recipe the way it was.  Everyone in my family preferred them without dipping them in pizza sauce too, next time I may add a little marinara to the filling instead.  This would also be a good recipe for a hearty appetizer or finger-food for a party.

This recipe was great and easy! I'm not fond of ricotta cheese so I instead used a bit of cream cheese for the same texture and to hold all the ingredients together.

This was a delicious recipe, but beware the picture vs. the directions! The recipe calls to unroll the dough into 4 sections, not 8. We ended up making these as calzone squares. Also, keep another can of cresent dough on hand. We used more than one can. We didn't use dipping sauce, the calzones are perfect on their own!

I used pizza dough instead of crescent dough. I also added pizza sauce directly to the cheese mixture. I think it would have been really bland without the sauce. It turned out pretty well except for the fact that the pizza dough bubbled out a little in the oven. It did need a little more salt to my taste. It turned out pretty good. I might try it again with more veggies.

I made these for supper tonight for our family.  Used crescent rolls- maybe needed to cook longer because they were a little bit mushy.  I agree that the crescent rolls and pizza flavor didn't jive with me.  I think might taste yummy with cheddar, bacon and onion.  Might try that next time.

These are very easy to make, and are ready in almost no time. I would recommend doubling the salt. Also if you like your pepperoni crispy like me, throw them in a pan for a few minutes on medium-high heat for a few minutes. awesome.

I'm giving this a 5 star score because the filling tasted GREAT! I made the filling the night before so maybe that helped meld the flavors (?). My version looked nothing like the photos. Mine were very flat and soggy. :-(  The taste was good but, I was disappointed in their appearance. Also, the stuffing was bursting at the seams. The ratio of stuffing and 4 squares of crescent rolls is off. I think I'll use pizza dough next time. Definitely worth a 2nd attempt.

I made cheese and pepperoni using mini peps for the kids, and then "supreme" style for me and hubby. Used refrigerated pizza dough instead of crescent roll dough because I'm not a big refrigerated crescent roll fan and saw the suggestion in another review. They ended up being bigger than "mini" sized and were a big full meal for all of us. Will make again!

The taste is awesome, however I ran into a issue when it came to the pinwheel part. It worked, no doubt - but I think I might have wrapped them too tightly. Wonderful on the outside, but SO soggy and doughy on the inside. I just don't think it had time to breathe in the oven. So, if I loosen up on the wrapping a bit, I think it'll be alright. Such a cute idea, though. If I perfect it next time, I think the kids will love them!

Excellent dinner!!!  Very yummy, I used it for a dinner and the family loved it.  Instead of cutting the roll 4 times, I cut it 3.  That made a little larger pieces.

I made these with homemade "Pizza Hut Original Pan Pizza" crust and pizza sauce.   I did put a little sauce spreaded on top of the dough before I put the filling on.  My hubby loves these will make again.  
My hubby said these don't freeze well,  and the bigger ones, which were the middle slices the dough didn't cook all the way. :(   I probably won't do this recipe again!

I edited these for a vegetarian guest and just put pineapple in instead of pepperoni and they were just as good as the original.

This was a good idea, but I think it could be better.  The crescent roll taste didn't seem to go well with pizza flavors, and I had to bake for 15 minutes because it was still underdone in the center after 10 minutes.  Pizza dough would've been much better.

Made my own calzone dough. I run out of ricotta cheese, so i used cream cheese instead and i guess i'm sticking with this version 'cause the pinwheels came out sooo tasty. Browned the onions, garlic, mushrooms and pepper first, actually added zucchini too, and substituted a can of tuna for the pepperoni (we're not big fans of pepperoni). Added a hard-boiled egg finely chopped. Yummy! :)

This is a great quick snack - or serve with a salad and make a meal of it.  I meant to use 2 tubes of cresent roll dough, but discovered I only had 1, so I just jammed all the filling on the 4 rectangles.  It worked fine.  The only deviation I made from the recipe is that I baked them before cutting up and increased the baking time about 7 minutes.

I really changed these up because I don't like peppers or pepperoni-ha!    I sauteed up unmeasured amounts of spinach, mushrooms and onion and cooked it until the mix was "dry".  I added the cheeses and seasonings just like written. I used the garlic flavored cresent rolls.  The flavor was great but I too had an issue with soggy on the outside.  I don't think it was my filling.  If I make them again I will follow a reviewers suggestion and not stuff them so much and roll them so tightly.

This was good but not exceptional so I doubt I make it again. If I do, I may add some more things for flavor like black olives and jalapinos or something.

Used cottage cheese, omitted onion and sauted the mushroom and pepper.  It was very good, whole family ate it but it didn't hold shape very good.  Maybe refrigerate the mix before spreading on dough??  Will make again!!

I'm rating these a 4 star because I know they would be better...only a teaspoon of italian seasoning for the recipe but it just seemed to overpower it. I will definitely make these again though but use less italian seasoning. We also made some with the pizza sauce in it instead of using it for dipping...they tasted better to me that way although the presentation is better made without.

These were pretty good.  We ate them on the road on our way to our vacation destination.  I used refrigerated pizza dough instead of crescent dough.  If I make these again, I would probably blend up some cottage cheese and use that in the place of the ricotta.  We just don't like the ricotta very well for some reason.

I made these on two separate occasions and everyone loved them, even the children.  I blended the ingredients in the food processor and added fresh basil, oregano and thyme.  The kids asked what was in it and I told the the cheeses and seasoning.  They loved them and they don't eat these veggies normally.

These were good, easy and fairly quick. My 3 year old son loved helping me make them.  I did pepperoni and mushroom and plain pepperoni.  I also used the refridgerated pizza dough instead of the crescent rolls.  Next time I may try adding the pizza sauce inside the rolls.

Great idea !!! ... i basically bored the idea here and used ingredients that were on hand and less cheese but yet yummy. Turned out great.
I did grill the vegs in a tsp of oil on stove top before using them.

I give this recipe 3 1/2 stars. I left out the onion and bell peppers and added 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic powder. The filling turned out very well. I found that I do agree with many other reviewers who said that the crescent roll dough was too rich. I'm sure if I tried the recipe again with a pizza dough I will like it much more. Also, make sure you use a pizza sauce that you really like. We used the Contadina brand and we were not impressed.

Love these! I've made these a couple of times already & my family loves these.  My hubby wants these as a meal all the time & even helped me assemble this.  The cresent dough does make this a little rich, I'm going to try w/ refridgerated pizza dough next.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were a hit!  This was a great, easy way to incorporate the flavors of pizza into a healthy diet-  I used fat free cottage cheese, reduced fat mozzarella and crescent dough, and left out most of the veggies.  I used pizza seasoning instead of italian, and rather than only use the sauce for dipping- I put about 2 heaping spoonfuls of sauce into the cheese filling mixture. These turned out fantastic!!  Will make many more times- Thank you!!

I agree that doubling the dough is necessary.  Also, I sliced 1/2 of them into the "pinwheels" and then didn't slice the other half.  The pinwheels leaked out a lot of the filling, whereas the uncut ones didn't. Delicious both ways.

Everyone loved these.  We followed the recipe with the exception that we each put our own 'topping' choices in the calzones.  They didn't last very long.  Thanks.

This is a good, quick recipe. I didn't have any ricotta cheese, so I put the pizza sauce on the inside of the rolls. The filling was able to stick together then. I didn't use mushrooms  because I don't eat them. For the crescent rolls, I used Pillsbury Grands. Great for a weeknight dinner or weekend snack.

Gave it 3 stars BC of the crescent dough, to me working with crescent dough is hard. I will make it again only because my son actually like it. If you just have to use crescent dough; roll it out pair them up like it says then refrigerate for a bit, then do the filling and roll up it might work better.

This was easy to make and kid friendly.  I sauteed the veggies to soften beforehand and used a tube of store bought pizza dough.  The family liked it and enjoyed the pizza dipping sauce.  Did it wow me?  No, but it was a nice break from the regular dinners I've made.

These tasted good, but were extremely messy and made about 8 times more filling than I needed.  Don't try to put one quarter of that filling on each rectangle.  Just use the amount you know will actually work (a few tablespoons).

These got mixed reviews the last time I ate them.  I think next time I'll follow another reviewer's advice and try with spinach instead of pepperoni.

I thought they were great. My kids loved them. We did change the pepperoni to sausage and add black olives bc that's the kind of pizza we like :) I do agree that the dough was a little off. I wanted a little more structure to the dough. The crescent rolls were too soft. I'll also be trying pizza crust next time. Still I consider them a hit!

Instead of slicing it before baking, I left it whole, like calzones.  The family said it was "OK", but that it didn't seem like calzones so much.  We decided to make it with pizza dough next time.....and just used the sliced pepperoni, instead of chopping it up.   They all loved the cheese filling, however!

These were very tasty & simple to make. I didnâ€™t use green pepper and next time, I think I will add some garlic. 
I also used turkey pepperoni to lower the fat content.

I used pizza dough and added one tablespoon . I added 1 Tbl of olive oil to make spreading the mix easier. Very tasty and a big hit!

These little pinwheels are excellent. Made them for 2 preschoolers and they were a hit - even with a very picky eater - and when we grownups took a taste, we decided the next time will be a double-batch. Everyone wanted more.  It's so easy, I've also passed the recipe on to my teen granddaughters for after-school snacks.

These were ok, a little to much filling for just one can of crescent rolls. I made these exactly as written & thought they were bland. Next time I would use a can pizza crust or two cans of crescent rolls and I would add more Italian seasoning & mozzarella. Overall, I really liked the idea!

The idea is great, and the flavor of the filling was good but the crescent roll taste through me off. The pizza dipping sauce is a must! .... going to try again with pizza dough.
