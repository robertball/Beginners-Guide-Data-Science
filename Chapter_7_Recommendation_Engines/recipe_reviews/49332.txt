This was a great roast.  We put it on the rotisserie and a few hours later enjoyed a very tasty roast.  A few things i would do in the future would be: 
a) start out at a higher temp to seal the juices in.
b)  put some hickory or apple chips in to add a smoked flavor.
c) if you have a gas BBQ put some briquets into a metal container and burn them as well to add the unmistakably great BBQ flavor.

The rub was good, however, an internal temperature of 145 degrees F results in a way too well done roast.  Will try this again, but next time I will take it off when the internal temperature is about 125 degrees F...  remember that it continues cooking during that 20 minute rest before slicing.  This seems especially true when cooking on a rotissary or grill, probably because the direct heat makes the outside of the meat hotter than when cooking in an oven.  Also, if you want some well done and some rare, set the rotissary on high instead of medium and cook to internal temp of 120F to 125F:  This should result in well done outside slices and rare inside slices.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Added a teaspoon of onion powder to the rub and used smoked paprika.  Doubled the garlic.  Added approx 1/2 cup vinegar and approx 2 cups white wine to the dripping pan along with about 3 cups water.  Initially cooked on a high temperature for 15 minutes to sear the roast prior to turning the temperature down to low.  Took about two hours.  Absolutely tender and juicy.

Very good. I also rubbed it first with Big Bubbas Rubba Chipotle Rub and left off all but the thyme.

This recipe is the bomb! I made it with my Showtime rotisserie grill. It was done within 40 minutes (2.14 lbs). I let the meat sit for 30 minutes on the non-heat rotation. I then used an electric knife to carve it to very thin cuts of meat. It was wonderful, and my husband had seconds. He added some creamy horseradish and ate it like there was no tomorrow :-)

way to much garlic......and the rub was nothing to talk about ....will go back to Montreal spice rub,.. much better bark. Like others suggested take off when temp. is 125* . Temp. rises 10* easily when you let it rest for 20 mins.
