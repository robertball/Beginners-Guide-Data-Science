We're trying one new veggie each week. This is the first time I ever bought raw beets, I tried this recipe, WOW!!! I didn't have grapefruit or lemon juice, so I subbed orange juice and key lime juice. My husband (who was very skeptical at first) LOVED this!!!  We will repeat it!

Really yummy - I only kept it covered for the first 15 mins and uncovered for the 45 mins to get some carmelization. Yum. Used orange juice instead of grapefruit (didn't have it on hand). Really really good. Could top with crumbled feta or goat chz - even better!

I tried this recipe for the first time with fresh beets and carrots from my garden.  My family loved it!! I didn't change a thing in the recipe other than it said set aside a cup of the veg to blend.  In order to blend it properly I roasted the veg and THEN set aside the veg as it was softer then.

I made this for the first time for a holiday party and it went over very well.  I had to fudge some of the ingredients for the puree but it was a delicious and forgiving recipe.

This was great! Didn't have a lot of time so I made some simplifications: just threw all the vegetables in a casserole, added the juice (used orange + lemon juice), plain red wine (didn't have red wine vinegar), honey, olive oil, soy sauce and spices. Mixed it all together and baked for an hour (half hour covered, half hour open). Turned out super yummy, will make again.

Love beets and was looking for a different way to prepare them. I substituted orange juice for the grapefruit as that is what I had on hand. Also, roasted the beets and carrots 35 minutes and then added the partially roasted veggies to the sauce and puréed. Added the purée back into the roasting pan, stirred and continued cooking another 10 minutes.  This was totally awesome!

This recipe is delicious!  If you're looking for a tang and heightened taste to your side dishes then try this recipe.  You will not be disappointed.  I served this as a side with our Prime Rib main and it was a perfect compliment.

There is a lot of flavor going on here.  I didn't have (or want) grapefruit so I used a combination of orange juice, lemon juice, and a little lime.  I  added an apple and left it uncovered for the final 15 minutes.  In the future, I might even add some raisins or dried cranberries.  It isn't especially pretty, but everyone who was willing to try it liked it.

4 1/2 stars.  I used orange juice instead of grapefruit juice, lime instead of lemon.  Roasted vegetables until almost tender and then made the puree in the blender and added to the lot.  Took this to an Open House and everyone said they loved it.  Because I have so many roasted beets in the freezer from this Fall, I'm sure to make this one again.

This sounded fresh and vibrant. I was excited to try it. I didn't love the consistency of the blended sauce. It was too chunky for me and I couldn't get it any finer. The flavors were good, but no one ate the leftovers and that was a first at my house when there are beets.

I pretty much followed the recipe except I precooked the beets and carrots in microwave for about 4 min. Reduced the roasting time to about 40 min. I added  1/2 cup of cut up pineapple and it was absolutely delicious. Will make it again soon. Fragrant, citrusy and good for you ??

I got precious beet haters to eat beets because of this recipe! Like many, I had orange juice so I used that instead of grapefruit juice... plus I personally like orange/beet/carrot juicing combo anyways.  Everything else was according to the recipe and it was delicious. It will become a staple side in this house!

This is awesome!  I steamed  my veggies first because I was time restricted.  I also did not pure the vegetables because I did not have time.  after steaming them I baked them in the oven and sprinkled a touch of brown sugar to entice  my children.  They loved it, so I will omit the brown sugar next time,  I think it will be perfect without the sugar

Followed recipe exactly, except used white grapefruit instead of pink.  Was delicious!!  Definitely a keeper.
