You'd have to really really really like spam to like this. And even so it seems like a fair amount of work to put in for the flavour payoff. You could do this with ham and potatos and it'd taste better and be cheaper (Spam is NOT cheap).

Was OK. My husband loved it I didn't care for the texture of the Spam was kind of mushy.

My Husband loves spam but did not like this recipe all that much we both feel it would be better as a breakfast type dish and instead of Spam I will try using either a good sausage or bacon..

I made this a few weeks ago and see that I forgot to review it so my memory is a little rusty. I thought this recipe was just okay. I hadn't had Spam in years and it wasn't as good as I remembered it and this dish was too eggy/bready for my taste. I'll keep looking for a great Spam recipe.

Tasty but mushy. I would probably add some flour to stiffen it up or maybe just less milk. I also used the garlic flavored Ritz crackers instead of soda crackers.

This was very good just a bit too salty. If you don't care for too much salt use unsalted crackers.

It's not as flavorful as I expected. There are additional ingredients that could make this recipe worth all the trouble.

Very good. Don't see any reason to change it - can always add spices at table if desired. Picky girls in family ate this right up. No good as a leftover anyway.

I made this recipe with light Spam fat free saltines and skim milk to significantly reduce the fat and calories. It still tasted good but my BF definitely preferred it more than I did. My only suggestion would be to dice the Spam instead of chopping.

I found this and made it for my family! I read some reviews that said the spam was soggy but mine wasn't. That could be because I add more crakers and cheese then what was called for in the Reciepe. I will be cooking this again for christmas morning when I have lots of company and very little time to cook! This is great!

I'm not a huge Spam lover; but my other half is. I added diced potatos; green onion; a three cheese blend; little paprika; seasoning salt; and garlic powder. Tasted SO good!!! I also topped it with tabasco; I like the hot stuff. I like that this seems to be a recipe that you can kind of tweak a bit and will always be good.

We both like Spam.  Only change was to add 3 thinly sliced green onions.  Oh, & I had to use GF crackers.  Very good!  Will be good for breakfast tomorrow.

I added green onion and potatos and one extra egg. I also used ritz instead of saltines. I think I used about 2 cups of cheese too. Very yummy!! 2nd time making it I used bacon flavored spam and added green onions 1 extra egg and used 3 pkgs of ritz cheese cracker sandwiches because they were crushed crackers in them already and I didn't want to waste them. Turned out really really good. This is a great basic recipe that you can modify based on what you have in the kitchen from ham or salame or any variety of cheese.

It was ok not super impressed but I had stuff I wanted to get out my pantry anyways. I would add less milk and way more crackers. I added more crackers to mine (like 10 more) still mushy but came close to almost a bread consistancy. I did use Ritz crackers. Might cook it longer if I attempt this again. They look real pretty tho

We had this for supper tonight and it was a big hit. I did make slight changes. I diced the spam instead of shredding it. I used wheat flavor Ritz crackers crushed; it s what I had. I also added Frenchs crispy onions to the topping just because I had it and wanted to use some of it up. Hubby says it s a keeper recipe and there was none left over. (I used hickory flavored Spam. Don t know what the other flavors will taste like yet.) This was not bland or dry as some reviewers stated. I timed this for 45 minutes and it seemed done so maybe one hour is way too long baking time.

This was a great breakfast. We added our own twist though. Garlic powder, onion powder, and hot sauce. Absolutely divine with the additions!

I used the new Hot and Spicy Spam and added onion and a few jalapenos...we like it hot! And it was great!! Definitely will be making again.
