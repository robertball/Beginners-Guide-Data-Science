This is really good. I use my own taco seasoning in this recipe and I also stir in a 4 ounce can of diced mild green chilies. When I make this, it disappears very quickly. If you can make this sooner rather than later, you'll be glad you did. The longer it sits, the better it gets.

I have been making this dip for over 15 years and it is ALWAYS a hit! Easy and delicious. I top it with some diced fresh tomato just before serving. :)

Loved this easy dip, in addition to all the ingredients here, I also added green onions sliced very thin, great flavors here as I made this the day before serving. I also used a white shredded cheddar cheese and served with Tostitoes Scoops. Thanks!

Quick and easy! Added a few chopped jalapenos to add a kick! Will definitely make again and again! (Economical, goes a long way) :-)

Very easy to make! I whipped it up in 5 minutes. I didn't have a can of green chilis so I used a can of ROTEL tomatoes and chili's and it was great. Seems very similar to other reviews that said to add some tomatoes. It was gone in 30 minutes - no time to meld flavors. IT WAS GONE! Sprinkle some powdered cayenne pepper on top to kick it up a notch!

This was a hit with my friends. I omitted the black olives and green chilies and added chopped jalapenos and finely diced red pepper and used half of the amount of reduced salt Taco seasoning mix. It was fast and easy and I served it with vegetable crudites :)

I’ve made this dip several times for tailgating or watching the game.  Always a big hit!  When I tell people the ingredients they are always shocked.  My cousin doesn’t like olives but loves this dip.  I get requests to make it again.  And it’s the quickest, stress-free app.  A keeper!

I scaled this down to 2 servings as I wanted to give it a try before making a larger batch. I wanted something to eat with corn chips, and this fit the bill nicely. I ended up adding a few more green chilies, a bit more taco seasoning and a dash of hot sauce.

Loved it!!! It disappeared quickly & every one asked for the recipe. I followed the directions without any changes since it was my first time making it, but may experiment in the future.

Huge hit at the party. I added hamburger to it because I had already cooked it thinking I was making another taco dip and it was delicious.  I did everything else like the recipe said. I'm going to try it warmed up next time.

This is really easy and super good!  I accidentally used a 28 oz. container of sour cream, so I ended up adding another quarter packet of taco seasoning as well.  I also put in some Rotel diced tomatoes and chiles.

Not the best... I used fat free sour cream. Maybe that was why it wasn't good, but it seemed like the shredded cheese never really mixed in well. A few people ate it at the party I took it to, but it was not the big hit I was hoping for.

When I first read this recipe I thought it was too simple to be any good. WOW, it was fantastic and I've made it several times since. My family loves it and whenever I take it to a party it's the first dip to disappear. Try chopped green onion and a little cilantro for that extra zing.
