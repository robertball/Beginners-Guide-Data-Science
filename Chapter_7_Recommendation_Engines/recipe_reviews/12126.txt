FANTASTIC.  Growing up in Australia this dish was part of our national identity, but here in the US I could just never get it right.  This recipe is just as it should be.  We always let this dish cool in the oven - just turn the oven off at the end of the cooking time and leave it there (even overnight!).  For those who have found that it sometimes sticks, in Australia we would coat the paper with a thin dusting of corn starch before spooning the mix onto the baking tray.

This was wonderful and so easy to make! I also used just 1 cup of sugar. I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 T powdered sugar to the cream. The barely sweet cream was a good balance with the very sweet meringue. I served with a platter of kiwi, strawberries, bananas & pineapple and let everyone choose their own fruit topping. It was a huge success! I read on another recipe to crumple your parchment paper, smooth out and sprinkle with cornstarch. The dessert came off the paper without any problems.

I grew up in the UK, and we made this dessert all the time over there. The ratio of the ingredients in this recipe is spot on, and this is how pavlova should taste. As mentioned, it is vital that no yolk get in with the whites(use an egg separator to help you if you want). Sprinkle the parchment paper with cornstarch to help the pavlova come off easily. If you want to sweeten the heavy whipping cream, you can sprinkle a little confectioners sugar in it. In order to help prevent cracking, the pavlova should be left in the oven to cool. Just turn it off and leave it in there for at least an hour. If it does crack, it's not a big deal because the cream will cover it anyway. Lastly, although peaches and cherries can be used to top pavlova, it tastes best and most authentic with strawberries, raspberries, or kiwi- or, a combination.

A couple of things are missing from this recipe, I like recipes to include ALL instructions. 1) When folding in the Vanilla, Cornstatch and lemon juice -- it should be blended together first!! She didn't mention this... The first attempt I added them one at a time, and the cornstartch created lumps in the egg whites, and all the folding deflated the whites slightly and had to start again.  2)She doesn't mention that you must only add the toppings of fruit, cusard, or whipped cream moments before serving!! I had a feeling this would be the case, but since I had never made it before, and it was not warned against, I added the toppings about 20mins before serving and lost all the crispness of the egg white -- except for just along the edge. Not the same effect at all. I felt like that should have been mentioned.  I agree with a lot of other comments that it was too sweet. I only added a cup of sugar to the egg whites, and added an additional egg white.. and it was still pretty sweet. I am guessing cream of tarter could replace half-a-cup of sugar next time.  All in all, not the best recipe on here for Pavlova, but if you add my instruciton, it would come out better then mine did...

WOW! The taste was WONDERFUL. Although I yook some others advice and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. Also also I placed a layer of bananas under the whip cream and used strawberries on top. Then I drizzled some chocolate syrup on top of everything. It looked wonderful! Was VERY easy to make! However, when I cut it into slices to serve, I was extremely disappointed that it was stuck to the parchment paper. It broke apart trying to pry it off the parchment, and looked like a gloopy mess on the serving plates. Does anyone have an idea why it stuck to the parchment?

My daughter was looking for a Pavlova recipe for her New Zealand project.  Since she is 10, I thought that a recipe with the word "easy" in the title was a good choice.  I read the reviews, several of which suggested reducing the sugar.  Being a conscientious mom, I took the suggestions to heart and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  WRONG!  When researching afterward, to try to find out why the whole thing cracked up into pieces, I discovered that the ratio of sugar to egg whites in a Pavlova is critical.  I still gave it a 5 stars because the taste and presentation was wonderful and easy enough for a 10 year old to make.  Next time, however, we will follow the recipe for the amount of sugar!!!  I am sure that leaving the sugar out of the whipped cream will balance the sweetness of the meringue.  We will definitely make it again.

AMAZING!!!  I have been making Pavlova for 18 years with various recipes.  I will never try another!  Perfectly crunchy on the outside with an inch of marshmellow fluff on the inside.  As suggested I used only 1 cup of sugar. As usual I topped with fresh whipped cream, strawberries and kiwi.  Thankyou for this perfect recipe!

i was worried that the meringue would be too sweet, so i reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was still waaaaay too sugary for our tastes.  if u would like a subtler flavor, then i recommend u try it out with only 3/4 cup sugar.  that way, it shouldn't be so sweet that your teeth hurt... ;)  i also learned a tip from a friend and added 3/4 cup yogurt and 4 T superfine sugar to the unsweetened heavy whipping cream (after having whipped it, of course) --- yum, yum!  it made for a really nice tangy/sweet taste.  i chopped up mandarin oranges and added it in to the whipped cream and garnished it with a mint sprig on top.  people flipped out and i've had 3 guests call me to ask for the recipe.  i snuck into the kitchen in the middle of the night to polish off the leftovers and they were all gone!  now, that's a compliment!

This recipe was phenomenal. It had a few bumpy spots (like the directions were a little confusing to me and my mom), but I made two and they both came out marvelously. I took it to my family's Easter and it was the hit dish. My great aunt even told me that even though she didn't eat desserts hardly at all, this was one dish that she would actually eat because it was light and had just the perfect amount of sweetness. The amount of sugar called for in the recipe, in my opinion, is perfect. I may not be an expert, but my family is picky and they all loved it, so that has to say something. Multiple people were asking for the recipe, including my great aunt. I also followed many of these fellow reviewers' advice, such as do not use fresh eggs from the fridge, do not open the oven while it is baking, let it cool in the oven overnight, adding a tablespoon of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to the heavy cream recipe to balance out the sweetness... It was delicious. I put kiwi fruit, strawberries, and blackberries on top (I was going to add passion fruit juice in with the whipped cream mixture, but the store was not selling any--sad face!). I'm seventeen, have no real, expert training in the kitchen, and I made this dessert by myself with very little difficulty--it was just a bit time consuming (prep time approximately 30 minutes to an hour and a half, depending on equipment and dedication). But it was more than worth it. Trust me.

Pavlova is one of my favourite desserts and I have always wanted to try making it, but have always been a bit scared. This lived up to it's name, it was easy. I reduced the amount of sugar in the egg white mix to one cup which was plenty sweet enough. Before spreading the pavlova I lightly dusted the parchment paper with cornstarch to prevent sticking. I used canned peaches and fresh strwawberries as I couldn't get kiwis. My guests were very impressed. Many Thanks.

This is a good recipe to do. The kids love it as they lick the bowl.
the only thing I would say is you do not need the corn starch.

I used this to make 6 individual pavlovas as there were only going to serving 4 people and once you put the toppings on top of a pavlova it won’t last long.  Alternatively the individual pavs are easy to keep in tupperware and dress to order!  I followed the instructions here until the baking, which I used Flo Braker’s method for individual pavlovas...I preheated the oven to 275 degrees and once I put the baking sheet into the I oven I reduced to 250 degrees and baked for 50-60 minutes.

This pavlova recipe turned out really well.  It was marshmellowy in the middle and crisp on the outside.  I substituted brown malt vinegar for the lemon juice and also used strawberries for decoration and everyone raved about it.  I have cooked pavlova's before but had trouble finding a recipe that gave the marshmellow texture - now that I've found this recipe, I'm sorted!

At the suggestion of other reviewers, I used 1 cup of sugar so my review is based on that modification.  This was my first attempt at Pavlova. Having sampled it years ago, I decided I had to make it at least once. I wanted to take it to a Christmas gathering.  My first try at this recipe resulted in a tasty but overly browned creation that cracked badly and collapsed. Not to be discouraged, I scoured the reviews and picked up tips online, before trying again. I ended up with a beautiful, sublime Pavlova with a delicate crust and luscious, marshmallowy meringue inside. I topped it with unsweetened whipped cream, kiwis and strawberries. It was marvelous! First of all, Pavlova is like cheesecake in that you must leave the oven closed while baking. My old oven tends to run hot so I nervously opened it several times on the first try which caused the cracking and collapse.  On the second try, I left the door shut and baked it for 45 minutes before turning off the oven and allowing it to cool for about an hour before placing the Pavlova on a rack. This time, the color was perfect and  there was only minor cracking. The top did fall in a bit afterwards but it wasn't seen under the cream and fruit. I'm not sure I could have done anything to prevent that. I'm so glad I tried making this because it's such a wonderful, different dessert. Next time, I would sweeten the cream, based on the feedback I received.  Rosina, thank you for posting this!

I loved Pavlova when I had it in New Zealand, and have always been intimidated about trying it myself -- as I haven't had much success with meringues. This turned out great -- a really easy recipe!  Here are a couple of tips I had read recently that I think also helped: don't mix a meringue in a metal bowl unless copper, so I used glass. Also, don't use really fresh eggs and don't use directly from the fridge.

I have no idea what I did wrong... i've used other pavlova recipes and never had a problem... Per the directions I was extra careful not to get any yoke in the egg whites and I did not overmix, but apparently something else made the whites deflate because all i had was a runny mess on my parchment covered cookie sheet... Apparently I'm the only one with the problem so suggestions as to what i may have done wrong are appreciated... the only thing i can think of is i live near the beach so there is alot of moisture in the air.  I hope it bakes up a little bit and at least tastes all right...

This always comes out great!  In order to cut the fat/calories, I decrease the amount of sugar in the meringue part to about 3/4 c sugar (still tastes sweet!) and make the topping with half whipping cream, half nonfat plain greek yogurt.  It's still just as fluffy/creamy/thick and the yogurt gives it a kind of tangy taste to complement the sweet meringue.

Made this a few times and my friend gave me a few TIPS:
Have the eggs at room temperature. Helps them to rise better. 
Also key - let it cool inside the oven with the door slightly open.

I might add you can substitute white vinegar as I did for lemon juice. You cannot taste it at all. I add only 2/3 cup sugar I sweeten my berries a bit and it seems plenty sweet to me. I also use peach or apricot jam and use it as a glaze to drizzle over my berries and then add the fresh cream.Just thin it out a bit in a pan with some water and then cool again  fridge. Lastly the fresh whipping cream and in my house this is the only way to go. This is my husbands favorite dessert and also a great dessert for those that are looking for gluten free desserts. Thankyou for sharing recipe. I should also add after thinking about it I reduced cooking temp to 275 and cooked for 40 minutes turning oven off and then leaving for 20 minutes. This dries them out more without over cooking and they are nice and crunchy like a crust to hold up to the berries. I read  was a common among some other recipes so wanted to try it since berries tend to be on juicy side. I loosen my pavlovas slighty from parchment as soon as done cooking and place back in on the drying process otherwise they tend to stick to the parchment.

This was easy...and delicious.  The true flavor of this dish is whatever you decide to make it.  I chose to top our pavlova with whipped cream and a mixture of blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries that I had let sit with a little sugar for a few minutes.  The berries were just perfectly ripe and the combination of the berries and the sweet pavlova was perfect.  This is a perfect light summer dessert!

Thank you so much for sharing Rosina! Fantastic recipe! I was scared to use egg whites because of previous bad experiences, so I used meringue powder instead (you can buy that at the grocery store) and came out beautifully.   I followed another user's suggestion of crumbling up wax paper then coating it with cornstarch, which worked great - wonderful tip!     You can apply the whipping cream a couple hours before serving, but do not apply the fruit until right before because the fruit tends to sink into the cream after a while. The next day after serving, if there are leftovers, the meringue crust becomes very soft and soggy but still holds its flavor and still tasted good to me.     Additionally, I added a small layer of homemade vanilla custard (Pastry Cream recipe from this website) since I had some leftover in the frisge to the Pavlova before applying the whipping cream, which enhanced the flavor.

Brought this to a birthday party. It was the only thing the birthday girl ate (she's 83!) I win!! Thanks to you and this delicious recipe. Really easy to make but looks like you spent hours. Be sure and splash some flour on your face to make it look hard. Bravo!

This is amazing! Luscious, crispy meringue. I have made pavlova many times and this one has been the best so far. **TIP** - Spread the tin or non-stick paper with a basting brush dipped in softened butter and make your circle out of that, painting around the edges of your circle too, remembering that pavlova can spread. I use buttered, non-stick paper. IT WILL NOT STICK IF YOU GREASE IT WITH BUTTER. I cooled it in the oven as I had to leave the house (switched it off) and it was amazing when I returned. This does have that marshmallowy texture another reviewer pointed out and I've found the best sugar to use is caster sugar. I freeze egg whites in zip lock bags after I use the yolks for something. I buy long life cream and have a tin of passionfruit pulp, always ready to make pavlova whenever I wish.

This was very tasty..but I was looking for a pavlova not a cookie..This turned out for me as the merigue cookie than a pavlova-in which I never had pavlovas before-also took hints from one reviewer to leave it in oven for hours after baking-came out way too dry and disappointed-its great as a cookie but not what I was looking for on our Xmas table.

Fantastic recipe - surprisingly easy. The key to success is to not beat it too much. Really good flavour. I used only 1 cup of sugar. I also turned the oven off and let the pavlova cool inside the oven (to ensure it was crisp). 

Thanks for the recipe!

Like what the title says, its EASY to make! I did make some changes to the recipe though. I used only 1 cup of sugar like what some reviewers suggested and it turned out sweet enough. I couldnt find heavy cream so I substituted it with Philadelphia Cream Cheese and it turned out awesome! I whipped it abit with some milk to get the right conistency and it was easy to top on the base. I also used kiwi, strawberries and blueberries to add variety. I found out from someone that it's best to get the base prepared a day beforehand so that it will completely dry out. So I baked it the night before and left it in the over till the next day before topping it and putting it in the fridge (pavlovas are best served cold). Also, to prevent it from sticking to the paper, I crumpled the paper first and generously sprinkled cornstarch on it before spreading the pavlova base. It worked like a charm! Thanks for this recipe!

Made my first pavlova today and I was so impressed with the result.  I used 1 cup sugar and did not have any problem with adding the ingredients.  Baked it for 1 hour and left in the oven to cool for about 2 hours. The middle part sank a little bit but it was perfect for the topping.   Very crunchy outside and soft inside.  Garnished it with sliced mangoes, Cherries and thawed mixed berries.  Very yummy.  My grandson ate two slices right away.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for this wonderful and easy recipe.

Incedible!I used one cup of castor sugar,as suggested,dusted the paper with corn starch,added more vanilla to make sure it doesn't have an eggy smell and baked in a slightly cooler oven. I let it stay in oven overnight. Great recipe! Thanks!

I made mini pavs, then filled with some leftover cream cheese frosting I had, topped with strawberries & blueberries and fresh whipped cream. I made a strawberry sauce for the plate. Sugar overload!! (But so good...) I also took the advice to crumple up some parchment, dust with cornstarch, then make the pavs on top. Didn't stick at all!

i've made Pavlova for many years. This is positively THE best recipe i've ever used. Two tips, reduce sugar to one cup and leave the meringue to cool in the oven after baking. TOTALLY fabulous

I wanted to give my American In-laws a taste of home (Australia) Once it was served, no one came up for air. I’m new to cooking so I will admit that my first attempt was a flop. I believe it was over beating the eggs or not starting with room temp eggs. So don’t make my mistake. It did crack like mad but I’m sure I will master the cracks the more I try it. If I can do it, you can. Believe me :)

Awesome dessert! Only made a couple of changes to suit my preference which were to add some lemon curd to the whipped cream and top with only strawberries. Served it for a friends birthday and it was a huge hit! Will make again for sure. Had no problems with sticking to parchment.

REDUCE THE SUGAR!!!  I should have read the comments before I tried this.  The recipe is delicious and the cooking instructions were PERFECT, but this was tooth-achingly sweet.  Will definitely try again with only 1 cup of sugar like other people suggested.

Love this recipe, it melts in your mouth, with a crispy crust and soft inside like marshmallow. Took pointers from other reviews, like use egg at room temperature, used 1 cup of sugar only, but it was stiil too sweet, I added sugar 1 tablespoon at a time while whipponing, I used the hand mixer at high speed, I take particular care not to overbeat the eggwhite. I folded the cornstarch by sprinkling it on top using a small strainer. Baked it at desired temperature for 1 hour, turn off the oven then left pavlova inside the oven for 1 hour. I used mango mouse to top it.

I forgot to decrease the sugar & I wish I hadn't...it was a bit sweet.  I used a huge pancake spatula to help "lift" it off the silpat (even w/ the silpat it still stuck a little). Mine was done in a little less than an hour (about 53 minutes) but my oven runs a little warm. I filled it w/ halved, pitted bing cherries, topped it w/ fresh whipped cream that I flavored w/ Grand Marnier instead of vanilla & I garnished w/ a sprig of mint & a couple of whole cherries. It was beautiful!!! And it tasted fantastic! I was worried that it would crumble when cut but no worries....we loved this, thanks!!

WOW!!  My son's kindergarten class had ethnic day and I was the only mother to volunteer to make an ethnic dish.  Not only did it look presentable but 21 six year olds loved it (not to mention 3 teachers and the office staff...principal included)  I made only 3 minor changes.  1.  For simplicity I used French Vanilla cool whip in place of heaving whipping cream.  2.  I used bananas and strawberries in addition to the kiwi. 3. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice  QUICK TIP:  I made this the day before so I cut the fruit and squeezed 1/2 of a fresh lemon over the cut fruit.  That kept it from discoloring throughout the night.  My only regret...I didn't take a picture.

This was such an easy recipe to follow!  The pavlova came out delicious and beautiful.  I was skeptical of the fast time it took to cok the pavlova - many other recipes call much longer.  However, this turned out wonderfully and it goes in to my family recipe box.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Thank you Rosina for not only making Pavlova sound easy enough to try, but for actually having a recipe that was easy and loaded with good tips.  The Pavlova was DELICIOUS and would be wonderful with any variety of fresh fruit.  I used peaches, mandarins and strawberries this time and only made a quarter batch (and it still turned out great!).  I love a recipe that remains true even when the amounts are reduced.  Thanks!

I made this about a month ago but never got a chance to review. They were delightful! I turned mine into individual size servings and left them to cool overnight in the oven. However the next day they did crack like mad and the centres had a more marshmallowy consistancy then they should. Solution... I placed them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours! I think the moist air helped to turn them into the fluffy little pieces of heaven they should be!

I had never had any kind of meringue before so I had nothing to compare this to, but it was very good. I followed the recipe exactly making no changes at all and did as another reviewer suggested by lightly crumpling my parchment paper, uncrumpling it and dusting it with cornstarch and had no problems getting it off. I loved the light airy texture and slight chewiness of it and how the kiwis balanced out the sweet. My mom enjoyed the unique taste and texture of this too and I will definitely be making it again!

I'm from Australia and this recipe reminded me of the Pavlova my Grandma made. The only thing it was missing was passionfruit but I could not find it at my local supermarket. I was afraid it may not turn out because I live at a high altitude, so I reduced the heat to 275F and cooked for 5 or so min longer but it turned out fine. The only problem I had was that it got stuck to the pan and paper, I think I will follow others advice next time and use a dusting of cornstarch on the paper.  However, all who ate it loved it. It tasted very authentic and I will make this one again, a great summer dessert.

This is a wonderful light & airy dessert.  Ideal after eating a heavier meal.  The fresh fruit is the perfect complement for such a sweet treat.  I remember tasting a dessert similiar to this in Paris, France called the Chantilly. Later, my cuban mother-in-law taught me how to make Merenguitos which are bite size meringue cookies.  I now can add Pavlova to my list. If you are a meringue lover this is a must try recipe.

This is a great recipe.  It looks fancy, it tastes delicious and it is easy.  Thanks for all of the tips on making a good meringue.  I made it for my daughter-in-law's welcome home party from her military service in the middle east.  It was a big hit & I'll make it again for special occasions.

I made 6 mini pavlovas instead of one large one.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!  I served it with lemon pudding in the middle topped with whipped cream and fresh raspberries, strawberries and blueberries.  I will be making it again tonight for an early valentines day dinner.

PHENOMENAL! I reduced the sugar to 1 cup as others suggested, and I think that the next time, I might even take it down to 3/4c. I sprinkled cornstarch onto the parchment paper before putting the meringue on it, and the finished meringue came off with no problems! Also, I let the meringue cool in the oven, not on a wire rack, so that it didn't rapid cool and crack. I used sliced fresh strawberries and kiwi, and drizzled chocolate syrup on top of the fruit: I am now a superstar! PERFECT summer dessert!

Made it exactly as written and it turned out perfect!  Kids & adults alike can back for seconds and thirds!  Had some Cool Whip in the fridge I needed to use so I put that on top but next time I will make the real thing.  Topped with kiwis and blueberries.

The temperature is definitely too high. My meringue formed a light brown crust that separated from the soft inside. Also, even though I didn't open the over at all during the process, and I let it cool in the oven for at least 2 hours, it cracked all over the place. Having said all that, I think I should mention that the taste was really good. The center was soft as a cloud. :)

This was very easy and tasted wonderful.  Added 1/2 tsp of almond extract along with the vanilla.  Cooled the meringue in the oven.

This was wonderful - such interesting and different texture it was fun to eat. I'd definitely cut down the whip cream - too sweet - and add more fruit! Will make it again.

Great flavor... I recommend using around 3/4 cup of sugar or else it would be too sweet. also leave the pavlova in the oven after baking to keep it cool to limit cracking.. but great recipe

This is perfect! My husband, who loves light & airy strawberry shortcake, raved about this. I used 1 cup of sugar, as others suggested. I also dusted the parchment with cornstarch and left the meringue in the oven overnight. Just before serving, I topped it with sliced strawberries, and I intermittently added slices of 1 kiwi for presentation. I then drizzled homemade strawberry glaze over it. It was awesome!

I made this for my husband's family on Easter Sunday - it was a hit!  I took advice of others and reduced sugar to 1 cup and increased vanilla to 2 tsp.  I did sweeten the cream w/several pkts of Splenda.  Topped with fresh strawberries and kiwi -it was beautiful and delicious. My nephew who hardly ever talks told me he loved it - that's enough for me to add it to my recipe box.  Thanks!!

I've wanted to make a Pavlova for years and decided to make it for dessert on Easter!  I followed the advice of the reviewers and decreased the sugar to 1 cup, piled the Pavlova in a high sided mound about 6 inches across (it did spread out to be about 9 inches), reduced the oven heat to 275 (my oven cooks hot), and left the Pavlova in the oven for an hour after baking.  It ended up cracking anyway, but was really quite pretty and very lightly browned.  Most importantly, it tasted amazing!  The crust melts in your mouth and the inside is like a very soft marshmallow.  I served it with lightly sweetened whipped cream and fresh pineapple because the store didn't have strawberries or kiwis (I'm just glad I can get any fruit in Alaska in winter).  A couple of tips: like some people said, crumple up waxed paper, smooth it out, and sprinkle a pretty thick dusting of cornstarch on top.  Once the Pavlova is out of the oven, let it cool completely before you try to take it off the paper or it will fall apart.

An absolute hit!!!  I made pavlova for the very first time using this recipe and it was loved by all. Even my husband who is generally not a fan, was raving about it.  Now I am about to make the recipe times 12 for an Aussie event coming up.  Can't wait to share this yumminess with the world!

I baked this for the first time for a work potluck.  I only used 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of whipping cream.  I used fresh strawberry slices and canned mandarin slices for the top.  I let the egg whites warm to room temperature as suggested.  One of my co-workers (who has made pavlova many times before) told me it turned out perfectly!  It did crack quite a bit but I'm guessing it's supposed to do that?  Either way no one seemed to mind!

This was so much fun to make!! I really enjoyed it.  It was so easy, too. I followed the meringue recipe exactly but didn't have any whipping cream on hand and couldn't get to the store. The internet came to the rescue! I found you could whip evaporated milk (look online for instructions.. you have to freeze it for 30 min. first) and it looked just like whipped cream!  It didn't have the exact same taste, but it was pretty good. So I topped this with my whipped evaporated milk and fresh strawberries. It was really good! I love how the pavlova had that crunchy crust and soft middle. I'll make this again! Next time, I'll put whipped cream on individual servings though instead of topping the whole thing at once.

Crispy, creamy, elegant, all words to describe this recipe. I made this for my families Easter super. The shell was so easy to make. I put the shell mixture on parchment paper that I crumpled and dusted with corn starch. When I took it out of the oven I was amazed how it puffed up and looked like a cloud. I made a mixture of 8oz. of cream cheese, 1/4 C. sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 C. powdered sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. I beat those together until creamy, then folded in 2 C. cool whip. I put this cream cheese mixture on top of the shell and made a flower design with sliced strawberries and Kiwi. I will post a picture next time I make it, and that will be soon! A must make.

This is certainly easy - I was a first-timer when it came to pavlova, and this was a cinch.  Everyone who tried it loved it!  Like the other reviewers, thanks for the great cooking tips.

This was probably the highlight of the dinner I had last night. I doubled the recipe and made two pavlovas, and they were fantastic. I didn't add as much sugar (only 3/4 cup per pavlova) as per prior reviews, and there were a lot of cracks in it. It wasn't nearly as solid as I think it should have been. Another reviewer mentioned the ratio of egg white and sugar is crucial when it comes to cracks, but I don't care about that since the whipped cream covered it up. I added about a half cup sugar to the cream for 2 pavlovas, just to sweeten it a bit.
Notes that other reviewers mentioned that were helpful: do not put whipped cream on until just before serving, spreading cornstarch on the parchment paper first, and mixing the cornstarch/lemon/vanilla before adding to the egg whites.

Wow!!!!!! Fantastic pavlova!!!!!! This was my second attempt at pavlova and it was sweet success!!!! The directions were spot on and it tasted amazing! The only small changes I made were these; I love chocolate so I added just a touch of coco powder and it gave the pavlova a little bit more taste. And I ran out of cornstarch the day before so I omitted it out of the recipe. And I really was not in the mood for lemon so that was out. But the taste was unforgettable and with whipped cream and strawberries, it was heaven on earth!! It even made my mother smile!!( that is sometimes difficult to do;) Thanks Rosina I will use this recipe again in the near future!!!!

I have made this recipe for Christmas many times and I love it! I tried it this year for 4th of July (with red and blue berries of course) and it was a hit. One variation I love to use is to prepare the meringue and then make "mini pavlovas." I bake them into small cookies with a little dent in the middle so everyone gets their own individual serving. This is great if you are likely to have leftovers, because you can keep the plain meringue cookies for a few days and add toppings as you need them. When I made the big pavlova, I was sad that the leftovers were too soggy to bother keeping.

Really good with fresh strawberries. I upped the egg white to 6, decreased sugar to 1 cup, omitted lemon juice and cornstarch and subbed cream of tartar (just a pinch). For the cream I added 1 T of sugar and 1/2 t of almond extract. Dusted parchment paper with cornstarch and had no problem removing crust and transferring to plate. Gorgeous and satiating and easiest dessert out there!

My new favorite dessert.  I've never had pavlova before, and this was spectacular.  Simple to make, plus you have to eat it all that day.  Sounds perfect to me!  I did cut the sugar back to 1 c.

We had pavlova for the first time last year while traveling in the UK. We liked it so much we decided to attempt it for Easter dessert. This recipe is great. The only adjustments I made were to add 2 Tbsp. powdered sugar and 1/3 Tbsp. vanilla to the whipped cream to sweeten it slightly and added strawberries, raspberries and blueberries in addition to the kiwi. We followed the instructions to take it out and cool on a wire rack, but next time I think we might try cooling it in the oven because it did crack a bit during the cooling process.

This recipe is my absolute favourite dessert!  It is perfect!  I add strawberries to the top with my kiwi for more colour and because they seem to be more poplular.  It's a great dessert for company because you can make most of it the day ahead and they all love it!  I follow the recipe exactly most days, but I have also tried making 6 small cakes instead of 1 large.  They are easier to serve.  I love the tip to krinkle the wax paper and then sprinkle it with cornstarch.  This definetely stops the meringue from sticking.  I have left the meringue in the oven after it is turned off for the overnight.  It doesn't crack as much, but I do find it changes the inside texture a bit, so I usually take it out after a few minutes and try to move it carefully.  Whip cream covers the cracks anyway!  PS... For those with citrus allergies, I have made this without the lemon juice and it turns out fine.

Wow definately a unique and interesting dessert...... turned out wonderful though... definately one thing to remember next time is after an hour just shut the oven off and let it cool inside as suggested by other reviewers..... but tended to crack up quite a bit... which didn't matter a ton because it go covered in the whipped cream anyway...  the cream definately does not need to be sweetened too much I added some vanilla extract and also about a tablespoon and a half of powdered sugar... the sweetness of the meringue is more than enough.... very easy to make also.....

This is a heavenly, wonderful dessert that makes me feel happy and like all is good in the world.  Fluffy, marshmallowy sweet goodness.  I made a fresh strawberry/blueberry sauce and poured on the meringue before adding the whipped cream.  OMG

This turned out really well.  I used aluminum foil instead of parchment paper and it came off easily.  I also used blueberries instead of kiwis and my husband thought it was delicious.

I've never expected a pavlova this easy to make.  The recipe was spot on and it turned out beautifully.  It was SWEET but blended beautifully with the tanginess of the kiwis and strawberries.  I followed the tip to leave it in the oven to cool overnight and the pav came off the baking paper without a hitch.

This was so delicious. Follow the recipe exactly. The unsweetened whipped cream and fresh fruit combine with the sweet meringue for a perfect taste. One tip: separate egg whites yourself! The first time I tried it, I was lazy and used liquid egg whites from a carton and failed miserably. No shortcuts when baking!!

Had trouble with mine breaking and falling apart. I've never had it before so had nothing to compare to. Also baked for an additional 30 minutes because it didn't seem to cook through, it was incredibly wet. By itself, it was too sweet, I literally felt like I was eating sugar- but topped with home-made whipped cream and strawberries, it was spectacular.

very easy, though too sweet, for me and my sweet-tooth hubby. will reduce the sugar next time. i decorated it with sliced nectarin and strawberries, amazing. bananas did not work though, they augmented the sweetness and it tasted not that great.

My new favorite dessert.  Very easy to make and so refreshing - topped mine with strawberries and blueberries.  I made the meringue in the evening and left it in the oven overnight to cool.  I did use the suggestion of crinkling the parchment paper and dusting with corn starch and had no problem removing the meringue.

I was kind of scared to make meringue but it was easy and delicious.  I filled it with fresh whipped cream sweetened with a pinch of sugar and vanilla, and served it with strawberries on top of that.  It was Beautiful!

So glad to find a recipe that doesn't use cream of tartar. I was really worried about attempting this dessert and did learn a few things to remember next time. One, reduce sugar to 3/4 or 1 cup. Two, I was so afraid of over doing it that I under did it. The result? A pavlova that spread to a diameter 50% bigger than I had planned. This thing is HUGE!! Three, this recipe was the highest temp setting I'd seen in comparing recipes and I should have lowered it. At 300 my crust took on a toasted marshmellow color and taste. Not bad, just not a snowy-white pavlova. 275 next time; turning off the oven after 1 hr and opening the door while cooling. Otherwise, I hope this becomes an Easter tradition we always look forward to. Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe that I have made several times and always forget to review. It is a great consistency and easy to make. I grew up having pavlova and this recipe is dead on! Mine always crack but you cover it with whipped cream before serving so it doesn't matter-it won't show. I also reduced the sugar to 1 c (still sweet) so topped (immediately before serving) with unsweetened whipped cream flavored with Chambord or Cointreau liquor -I have tried both with excellent results. I then drizzle passion fruit syrup (my family gets it in Australia but maybe could find in an Asian market?) and then top with fresh strawberries, kiwi fruit and berries (blueberries, raspberries and blackberries or any combo). I have also made individual sized for bridal/baby shower and substituted lemon pudding for the whipped cream so I could set out buffet style. Beautiful and delicious dessert!

WOW. I followed the recipe exactly, except for putting cornstarch on the parchment. I topped it with about half a pint of whipped cream, almost unnoticeably sweetened with about 2 1/2 tsp. of confectioner's sugar, and kiwifruit, strawberries, and raspberries. When I served it, the room went silent except for moans of pleasure and comments on how delicious it was. Unfortunately, mine sank somewhat and cracked a lot, so it was not particularly beautiful. Next time I will make it early and leave it in the oven for an hour or more. I have a feeling I will be asked to make this many more times.

I decided to make this for my honey on Valentine's day.  I remember him mentioning that he really likes pavlova so I thought I'd give this recipe a try as a part of a special dinner I planned on making for him.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I layered both sliced kiwi and strawberry on top.  It was delicious!  Valentine's day was yesterday and the two of us have polished off 3/4 of it.  The consistency was perfect, it didn't fall apart on me.  I think another reviewer was correct about the ratio of egg whites to sugar being key.  I barely sweetened the whipped cream to balance out the sweetness of the meringue.  This pavlova was wonderful and a cinch to make. Definitely "easy" although I would rename it "Perfect Pavlova" because it was so good!

For some reason, my meringue came out well but when I baked it, it burned. It came out a beige/brown color, tasted ok when I put the fruit and whipped cream on it though. It was already that color halfway into the hour, perhaps cooking at a lower temperature would help. Other than figuring out the correct temperature, excellent recipe.

Pavola is great. Just one comment for the americas out there. As a New Zealander what you call "kiwi" are known here as kiwi fruit as a "kiwi" is the small flightless bird that is the national bird of New Zealand- They are brown and furry and some one called the fruit after it. That is why New Zealanders are called Kiwis not after the fruit but the bird. Kiwi fruit!

OMG! This is the best desert and have made it so many times with requests for more. I use fresh fruit in season to change it up. I especially like this in the summer time when I can use fresh strawberries and blueberries. After baking the meringue, let cool completely before you put the the fruit and whip cream on it or else it will melt the whipped cream. I also use the canned whipped cream when time is short.

Fabulous.  I added 1/2 can of lemon pie filling to the pavlova before adding the whipped cream and fruit mixture and then decorated with strawberries.  The pavlova did stick to the parchment paper and was a little tricky to remove.

A friend asked me to make this for him - he lived in New Zealand for a few years, and this was popular there.  I had never heard of it, but am always game to try something new.  I'm so glad i did - it turned out great!  Everyone loved it - including my friend!  Next time i make it, I will put the strawberries on the bottom and spread the whipped cream out to the edges.  I layered the top with strawberries and kiwis.  Yum!

I make this recipe all the time! Super easy. Make sure that the eggs are room temperature before you begin otherwise it will take forever to stiffen, Also make sure your bowl is super clean and use either glass or metal (no plastic because they retain grease). I like to add about 6 tables spoons of powdered sugar and a tsp of vanilla to the heavy cream… Sometimes i make mini pavlovas just decrease the time to 30 minutes and you can get about 36 mini pavlovas about the size of an egg yolk.

What a forgiving recipe. I have made this pavlova many times and it has always turned out really well. Last night when I made it, I was not concentrating and put the sugar in the eggs before I beat them into stiff peaks!!! What an idiot! I scooped out as much sugar as I could then beat the eggs then added the wet sugar again. I was rather worried how it was going to turn out as I was taking the pavlova to an Australia Day function in the USA. To my surprise, relief and astonishment, the pavlova turned out perfectly. This is a great recipe if it turns out with the mistake I made.

This was my first time making Pavlova and it came out perfectly.   Only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 1 cup.  Will be making again.

I didn't beat the eggs long enough, so it came out quite thin and difficult to cut in the middle.  However, it was still good!  Things to note:  1) I left it in the oven for a few hours to cool.  2) I crinkled parchment paper, then spread it out with a thin layer of corn starch to prevent sticking.  3) I didn't add sugar to my homemade whipped cream, because there was enough in the pavlova.  4) I topped it with kiwi and strawberry slices.

I made this exactly as the recipe says. It was yummy but ridiculously sweet. Good thing I didn't add sugar to the whipped cream! Next time I will do as others have suggested and reduce the sugar to 1 cup.

I use this recipe for the meringue so I'm not sure on the topping, but the meringue turns out perfect if you closely follow the directions.  I have overbeat and underbeat my meringue more than once.

Everyone loved this dessert, even though I managed to make a flop of it - not the recipe's fault but I think it might have been the vanilla bean paste I added as an extra.  I ended up cutting  around a plate to make my pancake pav into a nice round shape, and then I piled on the offcuts and creamed it.. it was a lovely impressive looking thing once I was done :o)  5 stars for great flavour.

Maybe it sounds strange, but this dessert was just nothing especial to our tastes. The meringue was way too sweet and sugary, I used only one cup sugar. Probably not our kind.

This is a delicious Pavlova. I had one last year when I was in Australia and have wanted to make one ever since. I left mine in the oven for an hour after baking time, but it still cracked a lot. It certainly did not affect the taste, however. It tasted fabulous. I served mine with whipped cream and strawberries. I wish it was lovely enough to serve guests, but it was not. Also, I did notice a bit of an egg-y smell, as mentioned by some other reviewers.

I was pessimistic because I'm a terrible "stiff peaks" judge.  I was right - my Pavlova was deflated and cracked.  But, it tasted amazing.  Imperfections can be covered with whipped cream and strawberries.

The best pavlova recipe I've ever come across!   I used only 1 cup of sugar, and left the pav in the turned-off oven to cool.. and it came out perfect.  Have used this recipe twice already.. and this shall be the only one I'll use!

How I wish I could this recipe more stars. My first time making it and it came out so very beautiful and the perfect texture ( I researched about pavlova later after making this) Really easy and foolproof. Thanks a lot for the recipe. I followed it exactly.

This was sooo good.  I had never even heard of a Pavlova before, but am very glad I tried it... it was light and fluffy, just as I'd imagined.  I was afraid that it would only be good the day it was made, but after refrigerating (whipped cream and all) it still tasted fantastic, it was still crispy! In fact, my husband liked it better.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup, and very glad I did.

My first attempt at a meringue of any sort.  Came out fabulously.  I cheated and used Cool Whip instead of real heavy cream... I will do the same next time, but decrease sugar to 1 cup because it was just a tad too sweet... but wonderful!  I doubt I'll ever try another recipe!  The other thing is that everyone liked the 'crust' the best, so the next time I make it I'll shape into individual serving sizes so we can all have a larger ratio of the crispy part.  Thanks for a great recipe... easy and so impressive with strawberries, kiwis, and blueberries on top!

Everyone absolutely loved this! I didn't use parchment paper, I just put some corn starch on my silpat and it worked great. I have made it using just strawberries, kiwi and reapberries. Will maybe try chocolate and caramel next. Great recipe!

Made this yesterday wit our family.  Much lighter than we could have imagined, it was like angel food, but even lighter.   We used just some blueberries and strawberries and we ended up mowing through it.   
We declared it the perfect summer dessert and can't wait to make it again.   We will try the cornstarch idea next time as we did have some sticking.

Absolutely wonderful!!! Took it to a picnic and got rave reviews from the ladies.  I followed the directions exactly and used strawberries along with the kiwi.  Very easy to whip up but does take a long time to cook and cool off so make the time, it's worth it.

This is a fail-safe recipe.  Terrific! Using a TV chef's tip to prevent sticking, I scrunched up baking parchment and opened it out to line the base and sides of a flan tin, and coated it with a little cornflour. It worked a treat!  :0)

I made these into individual cups instead of 1 big pavlova. haha, so talk about not paying attention to details... i forgot to add everything into the egg mixture other then the egg white and sugar. (it's been a long day). Basically they were meringue cookies. With whipped cream and strawberries instead of kiwi. YUMMMMMY! Absolutely amazing and so worth the effort. I don't know what the tsp of this and that adds to the egg mixture but it sure is good without it!

This was simply outstanding. I made it for Easter dinner, and my husband said it was "restaurant quality." I followed the tip of crunching the parchment paper and sprinkling cornstarch on it. It did help it come off the paper. I also left the dessert in the oven overnight. There was quite a bit of cracking, but it got covereed with the whipped cream. This was delicious and easy to make!! I'll definitely do again.

I had Pavlova once when I was quite young, over 30 years ago, and when I was looking for a special "Springtime" dessert to serve guests tonight, I decided on this recipe. It really was easy, and very pretty, and DELICIOUS!  We decorated it with kiwi, banana slices and strawberry slices.  I also formed the meringue into several single servings, so that each person was presented with their own pavlova!

This is awesome!  My kids ask me to make it all the time now.  It's easy - just make sure you have no egg yolk or oil in with the whites or they won't be fluffy.

I made this for a church function and it was gobbled up in no time with rave reviews! My meringue cracked horribly, but after the fact I read that you should let it sit in the oven until completely cooled to avoid cracking. I'll be making this again for sure. YUM!

I have made this recipe 3 times. It is very delicious. I follow the recipe exactly except I use only a cup of sugar and about a half a tsp of lemon instead of a full tsp.

I used this recipe as a birthday dessert for my daughter who is trying to stay away from sugar and carbs.  Instead of a cake, we had this. Because I told everyone that I didn't add any sugar to the whipped cream or fruit, at first they thought it would taste terrible.   But as soon as they tasted it, everyone loved it!!  The meringue base adds plenty of sweetness to compliment the plain cream and the tart fruit.  
I made two, and with one I fussed more with spreading the meringue, trying to make it look nice, and it cracked much more.  The one that I spread with a minimal amount of shaping turned out better.  I also followed the other suggestions about preparing the parchment and leaving it in the oven to cool several hours.  I had a bowl of cut strawberries to pass so people could add more.  Delicious!

I made this at a friend's request.  It was pretty easy to do.  Used just a cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet!  I used a silicone coated parchment paper and it released with no problem.  Next time I will probably use a large star tube to pipe the meringue and make it oh so fancy!

This is so great!  Light, airy, delish... and gluten free!!! My kids love it so much they've already requested a re-run, which I'm making today.  Everyone requested the recipe.  I filled mine with kiwi, strawberries, and oranges... so easy, so versatile, so perfectly summery!  Thank you!

I have never made pavlova before, and it was much easier than I expected.  I chose this recipe because of it's hints on what not to do, when making.  It turned out perfect.  My husband, for whose birthday I made it, said it was the best he ever had.  It was even better the next day.  Not too chewy.

It's a bit of a process but if it's a wonderful recipe. I make it using 3/4 to 1 Cup of Monk Fruit instead of the sugar. 
A great summer dessert!!

Definitely use parchment paper on the baking sheet or it will not come off the tray at all!

Truly easy recipe with a few tips. Eggs at room temp whip up bigger and faster. I used the tips of others and mixed the cornstarch with the sugar before adding to the egg whites . Also reduced the sugar to 1 cup. Drew my circle on the parchment, crumpled it up and then smoothed it out. Lightly dusted the parchment with cornstarch before spreading out the Pavlova. After 1 hour of baking, I turned off the oven and left the Pavlova in there for an hour. Gently removed the Pavlova from the parchment by sliding a thin spatula underneath it when it was cool. I added 1 tbsp. powdered sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla to the whipping cream. It was delicious and enjoyed by all. Pretty easy dessert with a big "wow" factor. I wish the recipe would be updated with these additional tips.

I have been wanting to make pavlova for a long time.The first round I made pretty much per directions. It cracked, was a light golden color and was not pretty at all. So I did a little reading and then tried again. First, I reduce the oven temp to 250. Combine sugar and cornstarch  and slowly added to the whipped egg whites. I used vinegar instead of lemon juice also. When baking your pavlova when it is done just leave it in the oven to cool for a few hours or even overnight. It turned out perfectly that way and everyone in my family loved it.

I have made this three times now and it comes out perfect every time. It does help to let the eggs come to room temperature and to put the bowl and beaters in the freezer before whipping the cream.

I love Pavlova, but this was my first time attempting to make it. I had no lemon juice, so I use 1/2 tsp. of white vinegar in it's place. It tasted great and the vinegar flavor was no where to be found. Can't wait to make again.

I have made this recipe for years and follow it exactly as written. I agree with one reviewer who mentions it is left out that the lemon juice, vanilla and cornstarch should be mixed together first, simply to keep you from overfolding and deflating the meringue. You don't have to mix first, it's just easier. 
   Now, it's going to crack! This is not a big deal though, as you cover it up with cream and fruit. No biggie and it tastes the same.
   My husband is from Australia, grew up eating pavlova and RAVES about this recipe (he's typically impossible to please too!) I added banana before the cream once & while he said that wasn't traditional, I LOVED it! Just personal taste.
   The most time consuming part is peeling the kiwi and slicing fruit. Tip: buy fresh, ripe fruit. Regarding eggs, mine were fresh & it still rose very high.
    This whole recipe takes about 3 hours: make merangue, cook 1 hour, chill at least one hour ( must be COMPLETELY cooled), then put together and place in fridge. I usually serve 1-2 hours after its complete and it still has a chewy marshmellow like center, & crunchy edge. The next day it's ok (if there's any left), but definitely soft & gooey. It's a beautiful dessert - don't be scared!

Thank you for the recipe. It is very tasty. I did find it very sweet even after reducing the sugar to 1 cup and adding 2 egg whites. I will try 3/4 cup next time.

I did have a few issues when making this but not because of the recipe. I had bought liquid egg whites and they stiffened up but fell after I added the sugar, so just go with real egg whites. Also I did cut the sugar down to 1 cup.  I didn't have any issues with it sticking to the parchment paper. My family loved it so I will be making this again soon.

Relatively easy Pav to make though I did encounter some hiccups,I made one big pav and found that after an hour baking and leaving it in the oven till it cools (as suggested in other reviews) my crust was nice and crispy but the marshmallow middle was too thick. 

I will try it as mini pavs next time, that should be able to counter the overly thick marshmallow middle.

Did as other reviews suggested and reduced sugar to 1 cup, still too sweet for my liking (as other reviews suggested, yes it really does feel like its too sweet till your teeth hurt) so I can't imagine it at the original measurements. But then again, to each their own =)

This recipe was delicious.  I had to make it twice, as the first time I tried half Truvia, half real sugar...it didn't work.  Using the real sugar, it came out crispy on the outside, and a bit chewy on the inside, and browned perfectly!  I think this will become a go-to dessert from now on!!

What an elegant and delicious dessert! I topped the pavlova with strawberries and whipped cream. After making some gnocchi, I had 4 egg whites leftover that were perfect for this recipe. Next time, I will be looking for a way to use 4 egg yolks after planning for this dessert.

This is a great pavlova and it was very easy to make. I did listen to previous reviews and I allowed for the pavlova to cook for about 50 minutes and then I let it sit in the oven to cool so it did not collapse. I used a mix of raspberries, kiwis and strawberries to top the whipped cream. You may want to add the whipped cream and fruit just before serving.

Followed this recipe to a tee with the exception of berries rather than kiwi.  This was the first time I've ever made pavlova and I will make it again. It was a hit with everyone!  I may try it with less sugar next time because I think the fruit adds a lot of sweetness and we try to eat little white sugar. I was afraid that it would not make enough for 5 people so I doubled the recipe but it was not necessary. It was plenty for 5 people with leftovers. One review said to combine lemon juice and vanilla with corn starch before but I didn't do that and it didn't clump at all. I found the recipe to work very well.

Scrumptious! You need to know if your even runs hot...Mine does and I neglected to adjust either it or the cooking time, so the dessert turned a little brown, but was still fabulous.

For some reason I had a bit of difficulty with this recipe. I guess I was expecting it to be a bit more "fluffy." It came out kind of flat, but tasted okay. I had it with fresh strawberries, as I didn't have kiwi at the time. It was a bit too sweet for me.

Spectacular! I used to make this from a cookbook recipe, but lost it. I searched the web and this truly is the best recipe. Even better than before! I used strawberries, kiwis, and shaved chocolate over the top for an extra flair.

I had never made pavolova before but I had eaten it twice, made by a native of New Zealand so it had a lot to live up to!  I had to beat and mix everything by hand as I don't have an electric mixer (the woes of poor university students!) but it was well worth the effort.  I reduced the sugar and can't imagine it being any more sugary than it was, and I didn't even add sugar to the whipped cream.  I will make this again!

this recipes was perfect -i doubled it and it worked fine. It fell a little in the oven, but no harm.  I crumpled the parchment paper and sprinkled with cornstarch as suggested previously. I topped it with real cream whipped with a little vanilla and cornstarch, fresh raspberries and a shaved dark chocolate bar.  I do not consider myself a great baker, but after serving this to guests, they don't believe it.

This was fantastically easy, and tasted great, however, my merangue cracked terribly both times I made it.  Once covered with the whipped cream, it looked great, but I would have preferred less cracking.  We used about 1 cup of sugar, and used kiwi, nectarine, and blackberries instead of just kiwi.  Will make this again for guests.

This is a great summer dessert.  I made it with just the one c. of sugar and added some vanilla and almond extract to the whipped cream and only used strawberries.  Pretty tasty.  Will try a variety of fruits next time for kicks.  Worked well on a silpat, I also let it cool in the oven as suggested. Extra easy with a Kitchenaid mixer too!

I was nervous having never made a pavlova before, but it was certainly easy enough to make.  The directions and tips were great.  Mine turned out golden brown (was that a mistake?) and quite soft; it was a very warm day, so perhaps a winter's day would yield a crunchier outside shell?  I only used 1 cup of whipping cream, though; I think the pint (2 cups) would have been too much.  I used raspberries and blueberries for the topping, and the family loved it.  Very nice and light.

Good! I was introduced to pavlova a couple of years ago at an International dinner at my college (international students make and serve dishes from their respective countries, it's a schoolwide event), and when I found this recipe I wanted to try it myself. This was just as good, and very easy. The only hard part was breaking the eggs without breaking the yolks! I garnished with whipped cream and strawberries. I agree the amount of sugar may be a bit too much. Maybe next time I'll reduce it a little.

WOW...At first I was just looking for a recipe that called for kiwis in it, and I found this one. The only things I changed from the recipe were lessening the sugar and exchanged the vanilla extract with a bit of ground cinnamon for color/taste. Again...Wow...so easy to make and filled with such flavor! My family loved it and so did I. :)

I doubled the recipe and made mini pavlovas.  Sprinkling the paper with corn starch is important.  Still bake at 300, but for 35 min, then leave in oven for 1 hour.

I also freeze them in a Tupperware container, gently layered with paper towel.  I thaw them on the counter for about 30 minutes.

Turned out excellent! Instead of lemon juice I subbed 1 tsp raspberry vinegar. Cuts through the sweetness perfectly and add a nice light tart raspberry flavour to the meringue. Like others I crumpled the parchment paper then smoothed it out the  sprinkled on a bit of cornstarch for a easy removal.

Awesome Recipe. My only comment would be to ensure the egg whites are fully whipped before adding sugar,  vanilla, cornstarch. Thank you!!

I made this for my family and they loved it!  I used mixed berries instead of kiwi, and used 1/4 cup less sugar and added a pinch of salt to cut the sweetness.  Also, I was out of cornstarch, so I used cake flour.  It came out just fine.  It was crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.  Almost melted in your mouth.  So easy!  This will be my go to summer dessert from now on!

This was very easy to make, and turned out really good. I had never made it before. We topped with frozen tropical fruit as we didn't have kiwi or strawberries on hand. Everyone loved it, and will definitely make it again!

I've never cared for meringue, but this was delicious.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but I think I'll reduce the amount of sugar next time.  It was too sweet even for my overactive sweet tooth.

It's a little sweet for me so I don't use quite as much sugar, but it's easy to modify so this still works great for me.

This was too yummy.  I didn't have enough whipping cream but ummm,.... DELICIOUS   Perfect Spring time dessert.  Made it as the recipe states, did not have lemon so substituted white vinegar.   I used fresh strawberries.  I will be making this again.   Love the airiness of meringue... Crispy and soft inside.  A keeper

Make sure to put cornstarch underneath the meringue before baking. I decided to keep my whipped cream fairly plain with only adding a little sugar. The meringue and fresh fruit add enough sweetness for me. I made this for Easter/Passover dinner and it will definitely be a staple from here on out.

I am allergic to corn so used cream of tartar instead. I make individual Pavlovas shaped with a spoon by pressing petals around the edge to make a flower. They turn out beautifully. I fill with vanilla yogurt and fruit. The next time I will try to remember to take a photo. My B&B guests were very impressed when I made Pavlova for them. Just be sure to leave the little flowers in the oven with the heat turned off after baking.

Followed the suggestion to reduce sugar to 1 cup, and it turned out very well! Tasty with a marshmallow centre. I also took the advice to leave the pavlova in the oven to cool, to reduce temperature fluctuation/cracking. However, it did crack significantly. Not as beautiful as the photos. Maybe more sugar would’ve reduced cracking? Not sure. Would make again but maybe with a little flair: chocolate shavings or lemon zest in the whipped cream?

Excellent pav recipe but miles too sweet. I used 10 egg whites and 2.5 cups of sugar and it was far too sweet almost inedible. It also wept molten sugar after it was cooked. If you reduce the sugar content the crust will be thinner. If I were making this recipe again I would only use 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1 1/4 per 4 eggs whites it states. That would 2 cups per 10 egg whites which would be a lot more edible and less sickly.

I’ve been making pavlova for years and trying do fervent recipes.  This was the BEST pavlova I’ve made.   I divided into eight individual pavlovas about 4” in diameter each.  I then created a “make your own pavlova” experience for my guests.  We had the whipped cream, berries, and I had some shaved chocolate as option.  Very fun and rave reviews on taste.  I also reduced sugar to 1 cup, and turned oven off after one hour, opened the oven door for few minutes, then shut the door and kept pavlovas in oven until completely cool.  PERFECT

Bake at 250 F.   I used 6 egg whites and 1/2 cup baking Splenda. Combine cornstarch, lemon juice & vanilla before adding to egg whites.  Everything else the same except after one hour, turned off oven and left in oven until the oven was completely cool. (Do not open oven while it is cooking and cooling.).  It was delish. I had never had this dessert until I lived in New Zealand where it is a favorite dessert.  So good and really easy to make.

I have made this many times. It is always a huge hit. The quickest way I've watched it disappear is when I mix a little bit of fresh rosemary very finely chopped into the whipped cream along with some fresh lemon zest. Top it off with fresh blueberries and fresh raspberries and freshly made candied lemons (cut into thin circles) decorate with a bit more sprigs of rosemary, and you will be beating people off who want the recipe.

I’ve made this Pavlova recipe many times. It’s a favorite by all!  The only thing I do differently is cut back on the sugar to about a cup.  I use strawberries and bananas to dress it up.???. Delicious!!!

Absolutely delicious. I made this for my mom's birthday and it was a huge hit. I was a little worried that my egg white batter wasn't thick enough, but it turned out fine once cooked. I'm so glad I discovered this fabulous dessert.

I've made this recipe multiple times and I would not change a thing about it. Yes, it is sweet, but the cream and the fruit balance out the sweetness.

It was great! Super easy to follow the recipe and turned out great. Stuck to the parchment paper a little so I will use more cornstarch on the base for the next time. Overall it was great!

My 13 year old daughter made this recipe with little help from me. She said there were no instructions on how to remove the merengue from the wax paper. She would have appreciated some tips. She also recommends to not flip it on to the plate. :o

I made it!!  I’m so excited!  I’ve been wanting to make this for a long time, but was too nervous.  I did it and I feel like a Champion Chef!!  I do think I over cooked it because the color is a bit dark...but, who cares??  It tastes delicious!  Lovely crunch, luscious flavor, and the naturally sweet blueberries and cream made for the perfect dessert!  Yay me!!  Great recipe!  Easy to follow directions.  Thanks so much!!

If you already know how to deal with meringue this is great. Because if you do not the person who wrote the recipe left out a few HUGE details...
Mix lemon juice, vanilla, and cornstarch together first. Then I pour them in while still in my mixer and mix them in that way.
After baking for 1hr- YOU MUST MUST MUST turn off the oven and DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR. Leave your pav in there for at least and hour.. everyone who has made meringue or Pavlova knows this.. yet this recipe is for those who have not done it.
I had a great outcome with my first.. then the second I had a  whole ordeal and had to take it out after only letting it sit 30 min (after the hour bake) wow. It totally ruins it. It softened the bottom... And so it won't last for tomrw.. 
.
Also I store in a zip lock bag or a Tupperware container not in fridge..

Btw it tastes like lucky charms to us we love it lol

Delicious. Followed other reviewers suggestions and decreased the amount of sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe. I may have over-beaten the egg whites a bit - they didn’t form well. Didn’t have much of a dip in the center. But, It baked nicely and with the fruit piled on no one noticed. Would definitely make again. Light Easter dessert after a heavy meal.

So good! I didn't have any lemon juice so I used white vinegar and it turned out fine. I took the advice of another reviewer and combined the vanilla, vinegar, and cornstarch before adding it to the egg white/sugar mixture. I also left the pavlova to cool in the oven after baking, and I think I might need to adjust the timing on that (there was still a nice marshmallowy center but the crisp crust was a little thicker than I like). I topped it with a thin layer of lemon curd before adding the whipped cream, kiwi, strawberry and blueberries. It was for my daughter's sweet 16 and she loved it, so thank you for sharing the recipe!

Fantastic! Used berries instead of kiwi (family request),  and added 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the topping, reducing the vanilla by a smidge. Everyone came back for seconds - this one is a keeper!

I made this Pavlova recipe for Christmas Eve  and it was a big hit - crispy on the outside and marshmallow-ish on the inside. I topped it just before serving with freshly whipped cream and blueberries and raspberries. I actually made 2 of them and the second wasn't gotten into until 12/28 - 4 days later - and it was still delicious (topped fresh with whipped cream (this time real whipped cream but from a can) and berries.

 I took the advice of other reviewers and after drawing my circles on the parchment sheets, I crumpled them up and then smoothed them out and dusted them liberally with cornstarch and had no problem with sticking. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Yes! So good! Definitely follow previous comments and let it cool in the oven. It makes such a big difference in appearance and outer layer cracking. I've only ever used homemade whipped cream and seasonal berries, but I can see this being delicious with almost any fruit.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. You absolutely must follow the instructions of mixing in 1 tablespoon of sugar at a time into the egg whites. I rushed it with the first batch and ended up tossing it. The second time I did as instructed and it took 5-6 minutes to mix all of the sugar in. It came out so good!!! I would probably reduce sugar to 1 cup as it im awake a bit sweet but I tend to not add much sugar to my fresh whipped cream so that evens it out. I read that you could store it in a cool oven with the door closed (without toppings) as storing in the fridge could cause condensation. It worked for me! I just added whipped cream and fruit 2 hours before serving.

Yummy!  Making another one today for Christmas today. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar in the meringue base.  Baked per directions, turned oven off, did not open the door and let it sits for hours until i was ready to fill.

First time making pavlova and this was such a great easy recipe and EVERYONE loved it!!!! I had so many compliments at the end of the night. Like most people said I reduced the amount of sugar to just 1 cup and it was perfect. Made a rookie mistake and took the pavlova out of the oven after baking and it started cracking. Although the recipe says cool on a wire rack, you shouldn’t take it out of the oven. You need to let it cool in the oven, sudden changes in temperature will make it crack, but it still tasted amazing

Pavlova turned out great.  I did not pipe it out in circles, I just used a spoon, took a large scoop of batter and made individual mounds with an indent and baked off.  Since it was summer, I served with vanilla ice cream, fresh berries and whip cream.  Everyone was happy!

I made this for my book club, having never tasted pavlova or knowing how it was supposed to taste or turn out. Two of my guests who were familiar with pavlova said it was perfect. Success! It was much easier than I was expecting. I left it in the oven overnight as it cooled and to keep it dry, then just added the whipped cream and fruit immediately before serving. If I was going to change anything, I might subtract just a touch of the sugar. It wasn't overly sweet, but I prefer things less sweet.

An easy recipe to make and very tasty. Next time I will try piping it onto the parchment paper to make it a little more elegant.  Some changes I made:  decrease sugar to 3/4 cup, add a little of the sugar to the corn starch and then beat into the mixture at the end, combine the extract (I used lemon instead of vanilla) and lemon juice together then fold or beat into the mixture.

This turned out really delicious. Very easy to make. I let the meringue cool in the oven for about an hour after baking time to prevent cracking. Just turn off the oven and open the door a bit. The whip cream does not need any sugar. The cream helps cut the sweetness of the meringue. Will be making this again for sure.

Very good. I used to make this in Australia and I always used Castor Sugar (very finely ground) but honestly, I couldn't tell much difference. My family loved it. I put Strawberries, Kiwis and Passion Fruit on top.

Followed directions exactly & was very disappointed. The only thing we did was use strawberries & blueberries instead of kiwi because that is what we had on hand.  I did think about trying again only using my regular meringue but hubby said forget it. Was really hoping this was something we'd like cause I thought it would be a nice light dessert.

Great and simple recipe to make with easy-to-find ingredients. We  also made them into mini pavlova cakes, around 4-inches in size, so we only had to bake them for 30 minutes. We then topped them with mangoes and it pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the meringue and the bland taste of the cream. Also, it's very pretty. Would try selling these!

Simple delicious dessert.  Added about a tablespoon of powdered sugar to whipped cream after whipped to desired consistency.  Topped with sliced kiwi and strawberries.

This is a recipe to impress your friends.  It is so easy and so good.  It's like eating a cloud.  I used thawed frozen sliced strawberries and fresh blueberries instead of kiwis. I've made it 3 times in the last 2 months.  Everyone wants the recipe.  Enjoy!

Great recipe that can also be easily made into 10 to 12 individual desserts.  Cook a few minutes less.  At another reviewer's suggestion, I mixed the lemon juice, vanilla and corn starch together before adding to the beaten egg whites.

Everyone loved this dessert! It wasn't as crunchy as I thought it would be; it was delicious though. Mine was a bit darker in color than I thought it would be. If you have time to bake and cool, I am not sure that you need to preheat to a higher temp.

I had never heard of Pavlova and was intrigued by this recipe. I was blown away by the results! It was so easy to make and delicious. I took it to a ladies get together and was asked for the recipe several times. I added a few more fruits on top as I love berries, kiwi, cherries and the sort. I will be making this again!

Delicious. Big hit. I would reduce the sugar a bit but as is was gobbled up.  Also left in the oven after it baked overnight until I was ready to top.

Great recipe! Used only one cup of sugar as suggested and I was glad I did. Also used vinegar instead of lemon juice. The insides were soft like marshmallow and my brother ate nearly half of it in one sitting!

No need to pull this out of the oven after an hour.  Just turn off the oven, and let the meringue cool in there until you need it.

I've  made this a few times now. It's easy and turns out great. I do use only 1 cup of sugar and heap-teaspoons of cornstarch.  I follow the recipe and don't mix the lemon juice, vanilla and cornstarch together ... I just throw it all in. I've even tripled the recipe and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Left in oven to completely cool. Gives a yummy thicker shell.

This is perfect. Others recommended leaving the pavlova in the oven to cool off, to prevent cracking, so that is the only thing I would do differently next time. I'll definitely be making this again!!!

Easy to make and a big hit! I might use less whipped cream next time to have a better meringue ratio. I might try to pair with a lemon custard.

I made it twice with the ingredients as is. I didn't find it too sweet as I am pretty sure that's how a meringue is supposed to taste. I topped with lightly sweetened whipped cream and unsweetened strawberries which balanced nicely.  I took the reviewer's advice to mix the vanilla/lemon/cornstarch together before adding - key.  It was fantastic both times - the only changes i made the second time were that I used the mixer to add the vanilla combo (instead of folding) and I used an 8" circle to measure so that it would pile up higher - definitely improvements.  Thank for this recipe - no need to find another. So delicious and so impressive!

My first time making pavlova and it turned out great!  I made it just as the recipe said, but used lemon curd instead of whipped cream and it was delicious.  Turned out crispy on the outside with marshmallow centre.  Very impressive looking for guests.

I found this recipe a few years ago and have made it for many Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. Everyone always requests this dessert and there is never any left over.
Very easy to make.

I opened the oven and it fell, still taste great but my advice is once it is cooked do not open the oven door, let it sit in there over night.  Next time!

It was my first time making a meringue and I definitely need some  practice before making this dish to serve to others. I'm very thankful for the useful reviews left by other users. Overall, the pavlova was delicious. I've never had it before I made it, myself. I look forward to trying it again.

This is my go-to recipe for pavlova. When it's done baking, turn off the heat and let it cool down in the oven (I use a wooden spoon to keep the oven slightly open). Another great tip would be to add the whipped cream and sliced fruits right before serving; the pavlova stays crisp that way. I like adding fresh vanilla beans into it. Those little black specks make it look great!

I followed others' suggestion about cutting down the sugar to only 1 cup and I'm glad I did. The pavlova came out awesome and many calories were saved! It is definitely very sweet and not something you can just nibble on...you NEED the whipped cream and tangy fruits to balance it out!! I went the extra step of looking for passionfruit puree (found it in frozen form at a Latin supermarket) and turned it into a syrup as it was too sour if left alone. I prepped one slice with and one without the passionfruit syrup and omgosh it made all the difference! So if you can, I'd highly recommend finding the passionfruit puree for your pavlova. To make the syrup, I bought 2 frozen packages of puree and added 3/4c sugar and gently boiled the whole thing down to 1/2 the volume. One tip I read and used is to use caster sugar because it has smaller granules and can melt into the egg whites faster? Another tip I read is to bake at low temp to prevent cracking. I decided to bake at 275F for 50 minutes and 200F for 15 minutes. After that I just turned off the oven and left the door closed for another hour to cool down gradually. Mine came out picture perfect with minimal cracking. Loved it and will make it again!

This was my first time making pavlova.  I thought it was surprisingly easy.  I followed the recipe, but next time, I think I will cut down on the sugar.  Instead of making one large, I made 6 individuals.  After reading the reviews about sticking, I decided to use my silicone baking sheet, as I am always nervous using any kind of fat with meringue.  I baked for 55 minutes then shut the oven off and left them for an hour.  The only problem is that they had a slight caramel color instead of bright white.  Next time I will bake a little less and not leave in the oven so long.  Served topped with sweetened whipped cream, blackberries and raspberries.  What a wonderful presentation!

Made a double recipe. Came out perfectly following the recipe exactly, except  (agh!) I left out the vanilla! I took extra care to use a separate dish to separate the eggs (ain't English great!), so I could discard any egg if the yolk broke, which one did. Cleaned the copper liner bowl for my stand mixer with vinegar and salt to be sure there was no greasy residue at all. Used an oven thermometer to verify accurate temperature. Dusted a bit of cornstarch with a sieve over the parchment paper before spooning the meringue on to the paper. Gently nudged the meringue to the edges of the 9" circles (I made two). Didn't overwork it ...it looks nicer loose and billowy. The meringues nearly doubled in size. Left them in oven turned off until serving time.  Perfect internal moistness with crispy exterior.

My go-to recipe for meringue. Make it exactly as written and it turns out well every time. The trickiest bit is getting the egg whites to the perfect stiff not dry consistency. Sometimes I leave in the oven to cool, sometimes I don't. It cracks a bit either way.

My family loved this! It is such a light and delicious dessert.  I made another one the next day because it went so fast.  This will be a great dessert to make for summer parties.  I used strawberries and blueberries for this one. I am excited to try different fruit like blackberries and raspberries. It was so easy to make too!

Made a great hit and looked much harder than It was to make, reduced sugar to 1cup and no sugar in the whipped cream.  strawberry season makes sugar unnecessary!

I found this to be waaaay too sweet. The sugar needs to be cut in half at least. Also, I didn't use corn starch. I used 1/2 tsp cream of tartar because that's what I'm used to using for a meringue. I just couldn't get past the cloying sweetness however.
