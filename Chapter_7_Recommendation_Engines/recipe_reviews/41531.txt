After reading other reviews, I decided to make this recipe using fresh steamed asparagus.  I also added an 8 oz. container of light garden vegetable cream cheese to the mayo along with one chopped scallion.  Wrapped the asparagus in very thin sliced ham as well. 
Delicious!!

I made these for my friend's baby shower.  They turned out pretty well and I got a lot of compliments.  They are a little time-consuming to put together, but not inordinately, and are otherwise simple and easy.  I used shallots in the mayonaise mixture instead of regular onion.  I am making them again for my sister's wedding shower next month, and I think I will use fresh, steamed asparagus.  There's nothing better than fresh asparagus, and canned can be just too mushy.  Most kids wouldn't go anywhere near these.

I liked the recipe a lot, but something was missing. I buttered the bread, used chives instead of onion, and added chopped pimento. I served 60 of these at a party for a friend who had just passed the bar exam, and they were gone before all the guests had arrived! Everyone wanted the recipe.

This is a very good starter recipe!  I made these for a dear friend's baby shower. I used seasoning salt, and a scallion, but I also wrapped the asparagus with bacon. It turned out fantastic! Everyone wanted more!

I made these sandwiches for a club function and they were a huge success.  I've been asked for several repeat performances.  Easy, quick and delicious!

While I've never been a fan of seasoned salt OR canned asparagus, I thought I'd give this recipe a shot. I did use sauteed asparagus(in OO) and it came out very good! I was very surprised with the seasoning salt, added a tasty touch to the mayo. I didn't make the rolled sandwiches, but a regular sandwich. I also used a bit of lettuce in the sandwich as well.

I thought they were just okay, however out of all the things that were served, I heard everyone commenting on how good these were...so I guess they are pretty good. I will make again.

I was dissapointed in these. I think if I made them again I would use fresh asparagus instead. The canned kind was too mushy. It also seemed to be missing something to give it that extra zip.

Was very good, but yes, bland.  The quality of the bread used matters a lot.  Tried with buttered bread, or adding a bit of flavored soft cheese spread(aloutte) to the mayo and that helped, too.  Very popular tea sandwich.

I've eaten asparagus sandwiches all my life. This might be a nice dress up for appetizers but I leave out the onion and seasonings and just slap some mayo on some soft bread and load it up with the asparagus spears. I like 'em mushy from the can. Fresh or canned they are still fairly expensive so this is a once in awhile treat anyway. YUM!!

I used steamed asparagus which could have been the downfall of the recipe for me, but it seemed rather bland. I did add some powdered garlic and rosemary which perked it up a bit. I could see this being excellent with a sweet sauce in combination with the mayo.

These were certainly simple and rather tasty though I did alter it. I used oven roasted fresh asparagus spears. I used garlic salt instead of seasoning salt. I do think I used too sturdy of a white bread so in the future I would use the soft white for easier rolling. Thanks for sharing!

Tangier if you use cucumber salad dressing instead of mayo.

I've been making this for years but I have to tell you that if you substitute soft butter for the mayo, it is infinitely better!
