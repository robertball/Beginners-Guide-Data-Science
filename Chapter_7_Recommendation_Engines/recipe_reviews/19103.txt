Well, first off, I should say that I am not a fan of white chocolate at all--and my biggest fear with this recipe was that the cake would be sickly sweet--having said that, the cake turned out to be delicious and even me and my friend who don't like white chocolate decided it was a definite do-over. I changed the recipe slightly when I made it--adding a bit more white chocolate (250grams) and reducing the sugar a bit. Also, I didn't have buttermilk in the house so i used two (125g) pots of natural unsweetened yoghurt. The yoghurt worked really well to cut the sweetness of the cake and helped to make it extremely moist. The only thing i noticed was that the cooking time wasn't accurate. This could be due to the cake pan i used--anyway--the cake took about an hour to cook, and i lowered the temperature to 150 C after 35 minutes to prevent the top from becoming too brown. To serve the cake i turned it upsaide down and put chopped white chocolate on top as decoration! Enjoy!

I thought it tasted more like a yellow cake than a white chocolate cake.  Personally, it wasn't worth the time it took to make.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times it's turned out fantastic.  It works well as cup cakes.  Yes the recipe takes a bit of time to prepare but it truly is excellent, melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Rich but light all at the same time.  I iced it with Honey Buttercream icing

I was disappointed when it didnt taste like white chocolate at all. It was a very moist and light cake, but the name is decieving. It was also time consuming.

The 35 minutes  baking time seems to be too short. I would suggest ten minutes more.

Tasted great!  I use Nestle Milky Bar white chocolate, and it tastes just superb.  I do agree with other members, it does need to be cooked longer than stated in recipe.  For icing I use more Milky Bar.  Sorry don't know the quanities... but just mix/mash some butter into some icing sugar until completely mixed in and add some melted milky bar (or other melted white chocolate) and some milk until it's at the right consistency you require.  Very very rich, but very very delicious.

This was made for our Christmas cake. The yellow coloring is from the egg yolks. The taste is excellent although perhaps  baking powder instead of baking soda would have made it rise more.
     I will also make it for my birthday. This cake is DELICIOUS! I love white chocolate and this was YUMMY!

The taste of the cake was delicious.  However, the cake is not light and fluffy.  It came out rather heavy.  I used whipped cream frosting and placed strawberries on the frosting, which help balance the heavy texture of the cake.

This was really good and I will make it again for sure, but I was disappointed with the white chocolate flavor. I wish it had been more of it. However the texture was great and it still tasted amazing just not as white chocolatey as I wanted.

This cake made a very light and airy batter, but it totally fell and each layer was only about 1/2 inch tall.  The bottom of the cake was a layer of uncooked "grease". The taste was also off. I bake a lot and this cake recipe is just not right.

This cake has only been out of the oven an hour, and I had to come and rave.  Tomorrow I'm frosting and serving, but had a couple nibbles, and this cake is FABULOUS.  It's the lightest, airiest, most wonderfully moist cake I have ever made.  For anyone who said it came out heavy, must not have made it right, or cut a few corners, because the texture and crumb is exceptional when you take the time to really do every "fickle" step just right.

I made just a few changes:  I used 2 3/4 cups of cake flour instead of 2 1/2 of all-purpose, and an 11.5 oz bag of white chocolate chips, melted with just over a 1/2 cup hot water.  I baked in 2 8" round cake pans and 1 9" round cake pan at 325 for about 27 minutes, and they came out perfect (even in 2 different size pans).  

Cannot wait to frost it tomorrow, and hubby will end up with the best birthday cake I've ever made!

This cake is luscious and amazingly moist and melt-in-your-mouth good. The texture was PERFECT, but the cooking time was definitely guess work. I used two 9 inch pans and I cooked them a few minutes longer than it suggested.

When the cake started to get slightly more golden on top than I though was best, (mostly because it makes me nervous that it will be burned!) I turned down the oven, let out some heat, and moved it to the lower rack of the oven to finish. That seemed to help.

Also, it definitely needs more white chocolate. I used almost double the white chocolate and the flavor was only faintly white chocolaty. 

I made an icing out of cream cheese, butter, a bit of vanilla extract, powdered sugar and a whole bag of ghiradelli white chocolate chips. I would recommended those over any other white chocolate, to be honest.

Excellent tasting cake, but not "light and fluffy" and I agree the baking time of 30 min. is too short. Expert cake makers do not wait until a toothpick comes clean from the center as a cake will finish cooking when out of the oven, however, I would wait for the toothpick test on this one.

first time baking anything, was worried I didn't put in enough chocolate when the choco-water mixture was still watery (it s supposed to be I think?) and I got too lazy when whipping the egg white by hand and 'folded' it in when it was still liquidy. and it still turned out pretty good (for first try)! definitely will (and have to) make it again. this will probably be the foundation for any cake I make in the future that involves chocolate bars.

Only change I made was I used a bit less baking soda, and added a bit of baking powder. They are fantastic. Light and fluffy, with a good flavour. I have been looking for a white cake recipe that tastes good and isn't too dense, this is it.

This cake had a really wonderful flavor.  I made it in 3 eight inch layer cake pans and adjusted the time by keeping an eye on the layers after the first 18 minutes.... The layers came out just right... flat enough to make a pretty layer cake, but very light and moist in texture.  I did use white chocolate chips in place of baking chocolate and it did fine.  I will make this cake again. Frosted it with butter cream icing.  Yummmmm!

I used another recipe for a white chocolate cake which did not taste as good as this cake, and it  did not have the texture of this cake.   So far, this is the best white chocolate cake I have made,  I will definetly be making this one again!  I made the cake just as the recipe calls for and it came out fantastic.

My son chose this recipe for his birthday cake--he wanted a vanilla cake, but thought this sounded really good.  It was moist, with a full flavor.  He asked for peanut butter frosting with it, which I thought would be a terrible flavor combination but actually tasted pretty good.

I probably shouldn't rate this yet, but it's late and I'm annoyed at being up due to the fact that this cake took a good hour to bake rather than the 30 minutes! I ended up turning the temp down to 300 after the first half hour and the top is still a dark golden brown! Also, I haven't tasted a whole piece yet, but the bottom is chewy like a cookie and tastes EXACTLY like a sugar cookie... maybe I'll come back to this tomorrow when I've had an actual piece, but for now, I'm not rating very high!

Subbed vanilla yogurt for buttermilk since I didn't have any.  Very moist.
