I proofed the yeast in the bowl of my Kitchen Aid with the warm milk and sugar for ten minutes, then added the honey, the melted butter and the dry ingredients. I did use part whole wheat flour. I did need almost 1/4 of a cup more flour than the recipe called for to get it to form into a ball and jump on the hook. I kneaded the dough with the dough hook for five minutes. Once it was done kneading, I set it to rise in a covered, greased bowl on a warm heating pad until it doubled. I then used my 1/2 cup dry measuring cup to measure out balls, rolled them tight, and plopped them into 12 greased muffin tins. I let it sit on the warm heating pad covered with saran wrap for a half hour, then baked it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. Out of the oven, I brushed each roll with vegetable oil to make a soft top. I got twelve GINORMOUS rolls out of this recipe (I made them bigger so that I would not have to use two muffin tins), instead of two loaves. This bread recipe is quite good. I was worried that the amount of yeast might not be enough but it rose perfectly and still made one of the biggest rolls I've ever seen. This bread IS a little on the sweet side, if you're looking for a more savory-yeasty roll, this may not be for you. My whole family loved it, it paired nicely with Potato Soup. I'll make this again.

This was my first time making bread. The recipe worked well and the bread was very good. Be careful with the baking time. I needed about five additional minutes. I will do it again, by the way, my wife loved it.

Somewhat too sweet and white for me. I lost the sugar and replaced 1 cup of bread flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour. To the poster who had to increase the time, I use a dial type meat thermometer  and look for 200F. 

Also, oven temperature accuracy is quite varied, get a $3 thermometer that hangs from your rack, soon you'll just know how much you need to increase or decrease the dial.

This is a nice, slightly sweet basic white bread recipe which is exactly what I was looking for.  I did make a change using dry milk and water in place of the milk.  I'm just not a huge fan of the heating/cooling thing with the milk and prefer to just get the water at the right temp from the get go.  It's a laziness thing (or just efficiency) I'm sure.  I did this in my KA mixer.  Tossed in the water, yeast and a little of the sugar, let it foam (maybe 10 mins) and then added everything else except the final cup of flour.  Put the dough hook on and let the KA do all the work.  When it comes together, I add the final flour a little at a time until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.  Once its good, I let it knead for me on speed 2 for about 7 minutes.  Then you can pick up in about the middle of step 3 here.

Great bread for a baking beginner like me! I forgot the sugar, but with the honey it turned out to be plenty sweet. The only problems I had while making this bread were due to my own mess ups. A great bread recipe for those just starting out baking!

Excellent bread. A bit of work kneading and worth it. Mine rose slowly (It's cod here today) but they filled out nicely just like his photo. This is a keeper!

This bread is awesome! The first 2 times I made this bread the dough did not rise double when punched down. When I tired it again I mixed the dough up and kneaded it maybe a min or 2 divided it put it into the loaf pans and let it rise to double and baked it....turned out perfect! This one is a keeper.

Amazingly sweet, fluffy, not dense.  Perfect loaf, even though I had to bake it in our Kitchen Aid convection counter top oven!!  I've made hundreds of loaves and this one seems to be the most substantial.  Sweeter than most, but that's inherent in the recipe with lots of honey and sugar.  I doubled the yeast packets ( I put two in) and it was a beautiful loaf with another in the freezer for later this week!!!!

This is by far the best bread recipe I have used. I made in my bread machine using the technique used in the Best Bread Machine Bread recipe to add the ingredients. Other than that I went strictly with the recipe.

Easy no fail recipe. Have made and eaten 4 loaves this week! But have a question, itâ€™s a bit sweet. Does anyone have a good modification that ensures perfect results but cuts down in the sweetness?

I halved the recipe and made buns.  Turned out great and very tasty, but sweeter than we prefer for regular bread.  Would make awesome cinnamon rolls or sticky buns or Swedish ring though - any kind of deserty sweet bread.

The dough will not rise! I make bread about every other day and I've never had this problem. I've even added more yeast to the recipe without luck; so sad.

I was doubtful that this bread would turn out ok as I baked it and I was right. The teaspoon of yeast, I thought was not enough. However, I made the recipe as written assuming that sugar/honey would help the yeast to work better. It didn't. After 90 minutes into the second rise, the bread barely rose. At 2 hours, the bread reached the rim. It didn't have much oven spring. Also, it was too sweet for a white bread. It think this dough is better suited to cinnamon bread/rolls. I'm giving it 3 stars. However, I will try to make it again. Other factors may have been at play - mainly the cold weather. I will update the review then.

Thank You Dan.. ;0)..
Have been on a bread making kick lately.  Tried this recipe out but made it into buns. I used regular flour, Buckwheat Honey and quick rising yeast. After rising I halved the dough. I rolled each half into a 14 x 10 rectangle and brushed it with melted butter. After rolling it up lengthwise and pinching the seam closed, I cut each roll into 12 pieces and placed cut side down into large greased muffin tins. The results were wonderful. Difficult keeping my husband away from them.. ;0).. Yield - 24 delicious buns.

I tried this recipe the other night and it really came out great. The consistency of the bread was soft and mildly dense. It taste like a hardy white bread. I have it with butter and it's fantasic. I brushed the loaves with a little bit of butter to give it a nice glaze. I will make it again.

have made this bread five or six times now and everyone here loves it.  we like the bit of sweetness, and it makes excellent toast, french toast, and also sandwich bread (although it can fall apart a bit unless you toast it).  i have experimented with using 1/2 or all buttermilk for the milk with great results too.  thanks for sharing the recipe

This recipe made two of the most delicious loaves of bread I've ever had! I've been trying to perfect homemade bread for a very long time and this recipe was fast, easy and wonderful! My family and neighbors raved.
