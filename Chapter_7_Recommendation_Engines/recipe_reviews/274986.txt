Yum!  These were light and a touch crisp. Only change I made was to use kefir instead of buttermilk because that is what I had. And vanilla instead of maple flavoring.  Never would guess there was ricotta cheese in them.

Made exactly as described...left out the pecans because of an allergy. Great texture and flavor. Itâ€™s a winner!
