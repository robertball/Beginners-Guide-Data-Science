I enjoy cold soups, and this is a good one.  Using the tomato and basil sauce as a base is a great idea because you're already starting off with something that's bold and loaded with flavor.   I find many gazpachos watery, but the tomato and basil sauce in this recipe gives it good consistency right at the start.  The fresh veggies give it some crunch and layers of flavor.

This made for a really light and healthy light lunch.  It could certainly be a first course for a summer dinner or I would consider adding some shrimp and calling it dinner!  Very tasty and easy to make in advance.  Thanks!

Well done, Renee!  I love cold soups and this is a keeper..  I was feeding children as well as adults so I went easy with the hot sauce and allowed folks to add at the table if they chose.  I made 8 servings to feed 3 adults and 3 kidlets thinking I would have some left for my lunch tomorrow.  Wrong!  Thanks.

I have never made gazpacho, and since I cook for my parents who follow the pritikin plan I chose to make this. I left out the oil, sugar, and skipped the lemon juice. I microwaved the veggies just to kill off any enzymes. The texture was good even w/ microwaving. It made me think a chunky v8. I think it would be good warm, and might add chicken or rice to it if I make it again.

No substitutions.  Made recipe exactly as written.  Did add shrimp as one reviewer suggested. OMGosh!  Oh so delicious and super easy too. Perfect for hot summer weather. I'm already looking forward to making it again!  A keeper for sure. Thank you for this recipe :)

This was very good. I used Cholula for the hot sauce and added celery seed and Tajin. Delicious with our tacos on this hot humid day!

I enjoyed this delicious, light, healthy and refreshing soup (especially during the current hot weather). The sauce gives it a thicker texture....does not turn out watery. I had this two days after making it, so the flavor was surely enhanced. I also added some cooked shrimp just prior to serving that went well with it. I makes a ton, so I probably should have halved the recipe. I may try freezing a small amount just to see how it holds up. Recommended!

It turned out pretty well, I added in some balsamic vinegar and white vinegar to give it that authentic tangy flavor and it was fantastic.

Second time for this cornucopia of taste!  Loved so much mad it again but went a bit overboard with adding celery and finely chopped lg avocado. For the hot sauce I used Tiger Sauce.

Made this for a 4th of July cookout; it had been a very warm day with cooling evening breezes. This Gazpacho hits the spot, hot and cold at the same time and was a hit. I added an extra tablespoon of Sirracha sauce for extra kick, no regrets.

We loved it! But I'm wondering whether I can put it in the blender, to create a smooth gazpacho. Has anyone tried this?

This was very good!  I could not believe how easy it was to make using the Classico Tomato and Basil sauce.  Will make again.

I made this for the second course of a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used 4 medium sized tomatoes because my brother brought them over straight from his vegetable garden and I didn't want to waste any. It was a well-balanced soup and very fresh tasting. I used about 10 shakes of Chohula because I don't like my food spicy and I didn't find it spicy at all. My criticism is that when I ladled the chilled soup into bowls, a ring of water separated from the rest of the soup. It made for a less pretty presentation but my guests just mixed it in themselves.

Very easy, very tasty.  I did not add add salt since the sauce is salty enough.  Did add some spice and went heavy on the chopped vegetables.

Will be making this often - delicious and easy. Love using the Classico sauce as the base as I've never been a fan of tomato juice based gazpacho recipes.

Wow!!!! I was a bit skeptical....pasta sauce and sparkling water?!?!?  but it was INCREDIBLE!!! The pasta sauce provided the perfect  foundation of herbs & tomatoes that tasted like they've been marinating for days. Throw in your fav veggies, blend or keep it chunky.....easiest recipe ever and a keeper!
