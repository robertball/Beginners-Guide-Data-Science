This was great! Thank you for the recipe! Though, I did change a few things when I made it. I did not use cinnamon or bread crumbs. I added a little ground pepper, oregano, and caraway seeds to the mixture, instead. I poured some tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan and lined the bottom of the pan with some of the large, green, outer leaves of the cabbage so the rolls would not burn. Then I set the rolls on top and poured a can of tomato sauce over the top of the rolls. I did not individually wrap each roll in foil. I covered the whole baking dish with foil and cooked at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Then I uncovered the dish, and continued cooking for 30 minutes. I served with extra cooked rice. We really enjoyed it! Next time I do want to try them with the cinnamon, but my dinner partner doesn't like cinnamon so I left it out for the first time that I made it.

My mother's is very similar! Only instead of putting the cinnamon and tomatoes inside,  we add tomato soup (mixed with cinnamon) and diced tomatoes over them in a casserole dish and bake! (We also put the rice in uncooked and let it cook in the oven).

This recipe was terrible!  I should have listened to my instinct and browned the ground beef before assembling the cabbage rolls.  After more than 50 minutes of cooking, the filling was a pinkish, pile of mush--inedible.  I threw all of the rolls into the garbage.

Great recipe!!! Changed a few things to make it easier. Used Hunt's spaghetti sauce insted of whole canned tomatoes. Great if you don't like chunks of tomato. Browned the meat and added onions, 1/2 the sauce, minced garlic, uncooked rice and bread crumbs. Used one big baking dish and covered it with the rest of the sauce. Spinkled with cheese the last 10 min of baking. My kids couldn't get enough!!!

Good but save a step and use instant rice. That's what I do and it tastes great and there's one less pan to clean. No need to browned beef as one reviewer suggested. If all the ingredients are put together, rolled in a cabbage leave and cooked, then the dish will come out perfect. Again I say, stop using rice that needs to be cooked ahead of time. Instant rice will cook up in the juices that the meat and tomato sauce create.

Thanks, Becky = this recipe was just what I was looking for= I have lost mine from years ago and this is so much better!!!  Much less work also -
the cinnamon makes it taste so creamy and rich.
I did not wrap each in foil = simply placed rolls
carefully in an aluminum "loaf" type pan and covered with foil = much better than boiling or
cooking with meat! Using the pans is just a time saver.  Moist, delicious, tasty!!!
Again = thanks for sharing.

My husband thanks you dearly.  Such a picky man, but he fell in love with this saying it reminds him of grandma's, but he remembers her being in the kitchen for much longer than it seemed to have taken me to make these.  Either way, great recipe!  Will definitely make again and again!

Good taste. For me it makes almost 20 with an avg size head of cabbage and it's better to get 2 heads to get the big leafs that make it easier to wrap. Browning the beef shortens baking time- I did 30min. Didn't need to use a toothpick, wrapping in foil is good enough.

I modified the recipe a bit.  I browned the meat and sauteed the onions ahead of time. I'm glad I did, because following the baking instructions barely heated the rolls through all the way. Part of that is because I made 6 larger rolls.  I reserved the tomato sauce from the canned tomatoes to pour over top along with some extra tomato sauce.  Next time I'll cook for longer - these tasted much better text day.

I didn't like this, not at all what I was expecting.  I like cabbage, like ground beef, like rice, like tomatoes ... but this just didn't taste.  I did however kinda like the meat filling, hence the 2 stars, but won't be making this again.

These tasted fine but I prefer cabbage rolls with baked with sauce on top.  Will stick to the way I was making them before.

I had too much cabbage sitting in the fridge and wanted to get rid of it by making something with lots of cabbage.  This recipe turned out great and my family loved the dish, I heard a wonderful compliment from my husband.  One thing i improvised was since I didn't have canned tomatoes, i used spicy ketchup when cooking the cabbage rolls and it tasted great!

Had the same problem as a previous review. Rolls have been sitting in the oven for well over an hour and the meat is still pink. Followed the recipe exactly, and yes our oven works just fine. Not sure what the trick is, but we had to make something else for dinner. Darn! We were so looking forward to trying this too. Won't attempt again though.

I like this recipe as a basis for something, but I'm not sure what it needs to make it delicious. It's good/okay as is, but not phenomenal. I also cooked it in a glass baking dish with tomato sauce on the bottom and drizzled on top, then I covered it with foil. I also took the others' advice and cooked the meat first. Thank goodness I did! Even with the meat cooked it took a good hour to heat them all through.

I have always cooked my ground beef before stuffing my cabbage rolls but decided to try something different! The pink meat and the bloody sludge floating on the cabbage rolls made this inedible!

I used this recipe with my first roommate in 1976.  I lost the recipe in the early 80's.  Back then recipes were not as easy to find.  I am glad to have found yours on allrecipes.com.  The cinnamon gives that unusual flavor.  Like other reviews, we made it with tomatoe sauce of soume sort.  Will try tomatoe sauce, soup and my own spahetti sauce and see which tastes the best.  I feel 25 years younger discovering your recipe.  Thank you from the bottom of my tummy!

I don't understand why for some people the meat did not get done in the recommended time. I made exactly like the recipe and it was done and tasted realy good. Except for the cinnamon, it's very much like our family recipe.

Excellent recipe. I almost didn't use the cinnamon, but am glad I did. There were only smallish heads of cabbage at the grocer, so I ended up using 3 heads, and made 48 rolls. I sent some home with my in-laws, and froze some. They were even good re-heated.
