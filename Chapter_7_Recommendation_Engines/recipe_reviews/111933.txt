We are always looking for ways to use our deer meat.  We never grill burgers as they are always a little dry.  Well, this recipe was awesome!  My husband and kids loved these burgers!  So moist and delicious.  We will definitely have these again and again!!

This is the first year we have had venison, and I must admit I was nervous about preparing it!  This recipe was good!  A bit dry but that might be because I like my burgers rare, and we decided to be safe and cook it well. 

I took the extra and formed meatballs which i baked for 30 mins on 350.  They came out better than the burgers!

This was my first time ever cooking any kind of Venison.  After reading the reviews I thought I would give this recipe a try.  I was so impressed with the taste, flavor, ingredience used, texture, etc.  This is a winner and I will prepare this over and over again. I followed the recipe and didn't change anything.

This recipe was great, a nice change from the "in the oven" venison burgers. I used one onion instead of two shallots, and I did the bacon in the microwave. The burgers still turned out very moist, and my husband liked them too! The bacon added a great smokey flavor, as well as the charcoal grill. I would definately do this again!

Wonderful!! I cut recipe in half and still got 6 burgers out of it (well, 5 1/2). Also, I broiled the bun with cheddar cheese and bleu cheese crumbles until melted- great addition! Whole family loved these burgers. Thanks!

These burgers have great flavor. The only thing I substituted was a little onion powder for the shallots because I didn't have any on hand. It's too cold to cook outside so I cooked these in a cast iron skillet - 4 min per side, then finished them in a 425 degree oven for another 4 minutes to make sure the centers were done. It was a great meal with sweet potato fries and baked beans. Thanks!

Delicious!! I just recently discovered venison and absolutely love it. I had 12 oz of ground venison so I used 3 slices nitrate-free bacon, red onion and fresh garlic instead of the shallots. I added a bit of butter to the pan after I cooked the bacon and sweated the onion and garlic. I used half a beaten egg and some panko bread crumbs too because my meat seemed a bit sticky. I also added some dried thyme based on another recipe I read on this site. The pan looked too good with all the brown bits and bacon grease/butter so I added a bit of olive oil and seared the burgers that way. Just have to keep a close eye on the heat because they cook quickly..about 4 mins on each side was maximum to still get 3 juicy burgers. Added some sliced provolone on top..a nice mild cheese to counter the meaty flavors was perfect. Loved the smokiness of the bacon, the freshness of the parsley and the beautifully different flavor of venison. Ive seen so many recipes with reviews that state all the tricks they used to mask the flavor of the venison. If you have to mask it..you probably just don't enjoy eating it lol. This recipe was great..thanks so much for sharing it!

Delicious!  The best deer-burgers my husband and I have ever had.  The burgers took awhile to make, but the bacon, bacon grease, and olive oil were such great alternatives to the fat we usually put in our venison burgers.

MMMMM.

This was my first time cooking venison burgers, and my god was it delicious! I traded the shallots for onion powder but everything else stayed the same. If you cook in a cast iron skillet the burgers come out perfect. Will definitely do this again

These were great!  Just followed the recipe and didn't change a thing.  They turned out juicy and flavorful.  My 12 year old daughter is not a big burger fan (although she does like venison) and she loved them too!

Holy cow...eeerrr...deer!  These were, hands down, the best burgers I've ever made at home, beef or otherwise.  I will use this recipe from now on to make deer burgers.  I'd even use it to make beef burgers.  This recipe was outstanding.  Do not change a thing!  You will not regret the extra effort because the payoff is huge.  Yum!

AWESOME!!!  My family (especially my wife) has gone from dreading me cooking with venison, to asking if we can harvest more venison next year.  The way I prepare the meat ensures there is absolutely NO gamey taste.  I thaw the burger completely at room temp and then allow it to soak in cold water for at least an hour to allow the blood to drain from the meat.  The dark color leaves and it looks alot like hamburger.  I have also prepared the burger with just the bacon, bacon grease, cooked onion, and garlic, and used it in my meatloaf recipe.  Also great! We now try to stock our freezer with vension during the season.

I thought this was a great idea!!  I practically minced the bacon and fried it with some finely chopped onion.  I didn't mix in the fat, I simply scooped out the bacon/onion mixture, let it cool and then mixed it in with the venison.  I also added parsley flakes, minced garlic and ground pepper!!  Really great!!

Loved it! I've had ground venison in my freezer for months and finally decided to do something with it. The burgers came out juicy and delicious. Will definitely try the same recipe using turkey or ground beef.

Very good burgers!  This was my first time cooking with venison so I wasn't quite sure what to expect regarding the flavor and was pleasantly surprised.  Pan-fried indoors and topped with guacamole, sauteed mushrooms, and Swiss cheese. Served with onion rings on the side.

Sensational!  I fried up a whole pound of low-sodium bacon, chopped it up fine, and added most of the bacon grease to the burger mixture.  (I had a bit more than 2 lbs of venison, and didn't think the extra bacon flavor would hurt!)  I hand-formed them into beautifully thick burgers, and they grilled up perfectly--so incredibly juicy! The only thing I actually left out was the salt--I figured the bacon would have that area covered well enough.  Outstanding recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Super Yummy! I used onion b/c I was out of shallots and it was still excellent.  A great burger recipe.  My 2 year old ate a whole buger and he is super picky when it comes to meat!  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! Cooked them in the broiler (6 minutes each side). Made 4 burgers out of 1 pound ground venison. Didn't use shallots or parsley because didn't have any. Will use this recipe from now on. Husband loved them and said he hated venison burgers before these.

So good, I am always looking for new venison recipes.  This was great.  I used a yellow onion instead of the shallots because that's what I had.  Next time will make sure I have the shallots.  DH and kids loved them too.  Served with home fries  and a garden salad, mmm!  Might try making meatballs out of this recipe too, thanks!

OMG! This is the best recipe ever for venison burgers. They are melt in your mouth yummy and juicy and just the right amount of everything. I didn't change a thing. I cannot say enough about these burgers, if you don't like venison burgers this recipe will change your mind!

We were pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I used a small onion in place of the shallot.  We agreed that the burgers could use more seasoning though, so next time we'll all some montreal steak seasoning like we do for our regular beef hamburgers.

This was my first ever attempt at venison and I was very happy with the result.  Out of necessity, I made some adjustments to the recipe.  I had to add about a pound of ground beef (80/20) to the pound of venison I was given.  I soaked the venison in milk for several hours, just wanting to make sure these wouldn't be too gamey and touch.  Instead they were moist and delicious.

Awesome!!  One of our new family favorites!  My husband is a hunter, and we always use ground venison in recipes that calls for hamburger.  Although we never used venison to make hamburgers (too dry) -- until now!!  I am a picky eater and even I LOVE this recipe -- so tasty.    I followed the recipe except that I substituted 2 small onions for the shallots and used dried parsley from a spice jar.  I served them with them with homemade "Burger or Hot Dog Buns" from this site.  We will be making these again and again!  Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly - no changes needed. One of the best burgers I've had of any type of meat. I've grilled them on a charcoal grill and stove top in a grill pan. The charcoal were better but both were fantastic.

My husband said this was probably the best burger he ever had!  I cut the bacon up with my kitchen shears and cooked it with the onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  I'm thankful for the 3 burgers we have left over for lunch today!

This recipie makes the best burgers! My boyfriend (at my prompting)has made this 3 times, with the burgers being gone before the plate even hits the table. A must-try for burger lovers!
Edit: So, A year later he and I are still making these burgers for every picnic we do, and they are still coming out delicious every time! The only thing I've changed is cooking the garlic and onion in a little of the bacon grease instead of adding olive oil to the mix.

My husband is an avid hunter so we always have plenty of venison year-round. These are a nice change from the venison burgers I usually make. The bacon adds a great flavor and provides the needed moisture to the meat. (Venison can be on the dry side if not prepared correctly.) I did not add cheese, but it is something I think I might try next time around; just mix shredded cheddar in with the meat mixture before grilling. I also think this recipe could be converted into a meatloaf with fabulous results. I may play around with that idea as well.

Wow I have never had venison (and was hesitant to try it) and my husband has never cooked it. This recipe was perfect for us! He made mini burgers but didn't change anything. They were amazing and definitely a recipe we will have again.

Wow this recipe blew me away.  I'm a burger afficionado, and this was probably the best one I've ever eaten...better than beef...no joke.  They're delicious!

After eating these last night, I'm getting my entire next deer ground into burger meat.

Soo good!  I didn’t have shallots on hand but instead used a small diced up sweet onion. Kind of eye- balled the rest of the ingredients but you really can’t go wrong with the base of this recipe! I used my air-fryer instead though and cooked three at a time for 10 mins! Super juicy and tasty. Will definitely be my go-to recipe for a quick burger night.

My wife said it was the best burger she's ever eaten and now she prefers venison over beef. I used Pete's hot sauce instead of the Worcestershire, plus I added crimini mushrooms and maple syrup for extra moisture and a hint of sweetness. It worked!

This is an excellent recipe that I have made many times. I sometimes use minced pork jowl in place of the bacon and homemade Worcestershire sauce which I highly recommend to any courageous cook. I also like to make my own hamburger buns which though it takes some time is well worth the tantalizing result along with some freshly prepared chipotle or saffron mayonnaise and a few slices of heirloom tomatoes to boot!

Bon Appetit!

We were given some venison and had no idea how to make a good burger with it. Everything we had tried had been dry. This recipe was perfect. They were so moist. I used onion powder in place of shallots and halved the recipe, making 4 1/2 pound patties instead of 3 1/3 pound. We cooked them in a cast iron skillet, adding a bit of bleu cheese and alehouse cheddar on top. Great recipe!

These came out awesome, very juicy and tasty, my husband said they almost tasted like a very high end beef not gamey at all. The only thing I did differently was omit the olive oil and substituted some more bacon fat I had on hand. Delicious!

Really, really good!  My husband is an avid hunter.  I have used venison in soooo many recipes.  By far the best!  And to "264" who reviewed it this past January....THANK YOU for the tip on how to thaw and rinse the venison.  It made all the difference!  I will be using most of my venison with this recipe.  Outstanding!

Loved this recipe. Next time I will decrease some of the spices just slightly because there is so much flavor to it. However, this was so flavorful that my husband who never like any hot food with cinnamon or nutmeg didn't hardly notice those spices!

I didn't think much of this recipe.  There just wasn't much flavor in my opinion.  Perhaps doubling the Worcestershire, onion, and/or garlic would help?  They were not dry, though, which was good.  I really do appreciate a venison recipe on this site, and hope to see more in the future.

Awesome burgers!  One change, used Spicey Bloody Mary mix instead of the Worchestershire sauce. We used elk meat. Oh Yum!

Just made this recipe and LOVED it - BEST burgers ever.  I used about 3lbs of venison so cooked an entire pound of bacon and used about 9 - 10 slices and increased all ingredients - especially the garlic.  We've cooked venison burgers before and they always fall apart on the grill so we decided to try cooking  them on a cookie sheet (on the grill) until almost done then moved them to the open flame.  We did experiment with one burgers and it fell apart so I'm glad we opted for the cookie sheet.  Does anyone have an answer for the falling apart issue?

I had never cooked venison burgers before but had heard they were dry.  Followed the recipe except I used yellow onion instead of shallots and dry parsley instead of fresh. WOW!  This is a fantastic recipe.  Now my wife and I really want to go hunting to get some more venison!!! Only suggestion I'd make is make your patties, then partially freeze them...will make the stay together better on the grill.

These truly are the BEST burgers I have ever made.  My husband got his first deer this year and we have decided if he gets another one we are going to just grind it up so we can make lots of these delicious burgers.  My kids LOVE these and ask me to make them quite often.  In fact, they would rather eat these than regular beef hamburgers - this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing Lupin!

We eat more venison than beef and v-burgers tend to be dry.  These venison bacon burgers, cooked on the grill, were juicy, full of flavor--DELICIOUS!  I think even non venison lovers would enjoy these burgers!

Always looking for new ways to jazz up burgers.  With an avid hunter under the roof I have plenty of venison to play with.  This is by far the BEST recipe for venison burgers!  The bacon drippings added the perfect amount of moisture to the meat.  I use thick cut hickory smoked bacon - added wonderful smokey flavor.  Only added a bit of panko - not sure why except I grew up with bread crumbs in my burgers.  AMAZING burgers!  Thank you.  :)

WOW !!  Wonderful !!!  Only change was substituting Onions for the Shallots.  I also added a little more bacon grease that I had reserved because my bacon was so lean.  We will be making this over and over and over again!!

We love venison but since we don't hunt it's not very often when we can enjoy this meat.  This was a really good and easy recipe and the burgers were juicy.  Thanks.

This was the best burger.  I used 1 lb venison and it made 4 very generous burgers.  I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  The burgers were so moist and delicious, we did not add any condiments, just a nice grainy bun.  I will make this over and over.

I've never liked venison burgers (and swore I'd never eat them again), but this recipe is most excellent and I'm so glad I tried it.  The 5 and 3 year old ate theirs gone.  I'm actually looking forward to making these again!  The only modification I made was to use onions instead of shallots.   Thank you so much for the recipe.

These are some of the best burgers we have ever tasted. I omitted the olive oil and just sauteed garlic and shallots in some of the bacon drippings. We live in the north woods and always have venison in the freezer. What a great way to use the ground meat. Thanks for sharing.

I made these burgers for my husbands birthday party. They were easy to make and even easier to shape. The flavor was good. My suggestion would be to flatten them out pretty good before grilling. Thanks for a good burger recipe.

This was really good. We had never tried venison before but my husband got a deer this year. This city girl had no idea how to cook it. This is how. Soooo tasty even my five year old ate it. Hubs went back for seconds. And the leftovers reheated well the next day - not that there were many of them. I did it in a cast iron on the stove like several others commented they did. I got seven burgers out of my pound of meat, so I think I made them a little smaller than the recipe intended. Three minutes on each side in a medium heat preheated cast iron. Then put it in the oven (425 degrees) for 3-4 minutes. Perfect.

Absolutely amazing! We only used two slices of bacon and felt that it was plenty of fat. We eat pretty lean, but regardless it was perfect without the additional bacon. Would highly recommend and will repeat this recipe.

This recipe is delicious!! The only change I made was that I mixed a little of the bacon grease in with the venison. Smoked is my family's favorite but we also love them grilled. A definite keeper!

This recipe also makes excellent meatballs! Just pop it in the oven at 400 with your choice of sauce for 40 minutes.

These were great, moist and flavorful! I took out the shallots and ended cooking a little early so I could broil the patties with a slice of cheddar on top for a minute. I used a whole egg for just 2 burgers, which was a bit much, but it kept everything moist for cooking. Next time I'll add some spice for a little something extra.

Best venison burgers ever. Moist, with the nice crunch of bacon.
  I've served it to others that said "I don't care for venison, it's it has a wild taste" No wild taste here

These were the BEST burgers we've ever had! even outside the fact that they were made with deer meat. I used red onion bc I didn't have any shallots on hand and cut out the egg bc it was very wet already. AMAZING!!!

This is the best venison recipe ever! I used regular onion (didn't have scallion), halved the recipe &, like another reviewer, still got five burgers. I used 2 T. egg beaters as I didn't know how to halve an egg. Topped with melted Irish Cheddar. This recipe will inspire my husband to continue the hunt!

Very tasty!! We have a freezer full of venison which I've been hesitant to cook. This recipe was better than I expected. I'm not a huge venison fan yet this burger was delicious. I made the is recipe exactly as written.  My bacon yielded a lot of grease so I was not sure how much to incorporate into the dish. I ended up using 1 tablespoon.  My husband did not care for the chopped fresh parsley in the burger yet I felt it added flavor.  Definitely will make this again!

Made this recipe to get rid of the older food that needed a home. This a very nice burger recipe. I've made meatloaf with an egg in it but never a hamburger. I think it's there to hold the meat together. I didn't get a chance to refrigerate the meat for 20 minutes like it asked but figured it was also to hold the meat together. One hamburger did try to split apart a little. It was one that wasn't cooking as quickly so I thought that had something to do with it as all the other ones were pretty little hamburgers. I hope to make again.

I haven't ever cooked venison before, so this was my first experience... and what a great first recipe to start with!  As a note, fresh ground venison was tough to find in my small town. However, I was successful at finding it in the frozen food section of Whole Foods/Nugget Market, with the assistance of a patient employee from the meat department.  Anyway, the recipe was quite simple, and with a Cuisinart, prep time was cut down even more!  Venison is exceptionally lean, so it's good to remember that it cooks very quickly and can easily be over cooked if the temperature is too high or in the pan/on the grill for too long, even if the temperature is low.  We added cheese and toasted the buns for a tasty finished product!  I made these burgers for my friend's children and they absolutely raved about  them!  The 6 year old even declared that he wanted one for lunch every day!  A definite winner!

yes, will make it again! according to another reviewer's advice, i soaked the raw ground deer  (he said in water but i usually soak my venison in milk. Soaking venison in milk or water helps drain blood out of the meat so it tastes more mellow. Since i was grilling it and didn't want to worry about it burning quickly, i soaked it in unsweetened almond milk). let it soak in bowl in the fridge about a half hour then i drained the meat and squeezed handfuls of it to get out the milk.  then i followed the recipe. quick tip***cut the raw bacon up with scissors before cooking it. it cooks quicker and no need to crumble it cuz it is already chopped***.tripled the amount of fresh parsley.  DOES NOT NEED ADDED SALT,THE BACON IS SALTY ENOUGH!
I used a black peppered bacon so no need to add additional black pepper. we like a lot of garlic so i just kept spooning more from the jar of minced garlic that i keep on hand.  served them with provolone and swiss cheese. THESE HAD NO GAMEY TASTE WHATSOEVER.  i actually was a little disappointed because i like a little gamey tast. so next time, i will not soak the venison in  milk before i mix up the recipe. another thing i wanna do next time is chop mushroom and mix into the patty, or just serve them with sauteed mushrooms.  The best part of this recipe was that it was absolutely moist and delicious, not dry at all.  All that bacon and grease did not make it greasy or overpowering at all.  Actually, because we did grill the patties over charcoal

Outstanding! A bit of work for an old Marine but worth it. Ono grinds as we'd say in Hawai'i.

I have a freezer full of deer meat and haven't really had experience cooking with venison. Followed the recipe, however didn't have any bacon. But I did have some bacon grease I had saved from breakfast. Also added a couple of drops of liquid smoke flavoring.The burgers were very moist and full of flavor. Definitely a hit with my family!!

First time trying this recipe and I LOVE it. I might try it without the egg next time though. I know it's used as a binding agent to help the burgers from falling apart but it gave them more of a meatloaf consistency and I'm curious to see if I flip them carefully if they don't really need the egg. :Still a fantastic recipe!

Not gonna lie, it was my first experience making hand made burgers. It was also the first buck I got processed from a new deer processor. I made the burgers according to the recipe but needless to say because of it being my first time I was very very nervous. We invited 9 people over for a Halloween BBQ. I was very scared they would've turned out badly so I had hotdogs on standby. However people much older than myself said they were the best burgers they ever had. WHEWWW! That was a relief . Now just to make sure I secretly went to every individual at the BBQ and asked them 1 on 1 just to make sure they weren't just being nice. They all had the same consensus. Awesome recipe! I've given it to fellow hunters and they all seem excited to try it. Definitely give it a try. MAKE LARGE BURGER THOUGH. Although they were awesome they shrank to slider size while on the grill because I made them thick but like bubba burger diameter. The last ones I made recently were about 6inches in diameter and they were the right size.

These turned out great, the eggs helped hold the deer together the spices and other ingredients really intensified the flavor. I decided to leave out the bacon to keep it on the healthier side. I also used a little, but of onion because I didn't have shallots. Definitely will use again.

I'm new to cooking venison and need all the help I can get. 
This recipe deserves 10 stars!  I didn't have all the ingredients, but they were still amazing.  
I used a few drops of liquid smoke in place of Worch. sauce, skipped the shallots and used a pound of bacon.  I topped them with lettuce and a little mayo and used potato rolls. 
This yielded 10 mini/medium burgers.  
Will make again!

Wonderful recipe.  These burgers are outstanding and the ingredients really compliment the venison flavor.  The burgers are a little crumbly while cooking making it a little difficult to turn them over.  This is typical though when cooking venison.  
This recipe is definitely one that I will make again and again!  Thank you for submitting.

Thanks for this great recipe. I tried it with ground elk, which I received from a co-worker and my first time  cooking, or even trying game. I followed the recipe, except I omitted the parsley as I didn't have any on hand. I added an avocado on top, and served on a toasted onion bun. Hubby grilled it up and it was very tasty!

Everyone who has tried these at our backyard cookouts has loved them!   Even people who don't care for venison really enjoyed them.  They are moist due to the addition of the bacon.  No more dry venison burgers!  Thank you for posting your recipe, Lupin.

This recipe was fantastic! This was the first time we have ever tried venison and I followed the recipe as presented. There was no gamey taste and the meat was tender and juicy. My kids said they were the best burgers they've ever had! We'll definitely have it again.

These are great!  Mine came out a little mushy (because I cut the recipe down and wasn't quite sure how to use 1/6th of an egg, or whatever it was), but they were still so amazing!  I always hated venison when I was younger, but using this recipe, it was actually super tasty.

This recipe makes a very good burger. I did not have shallots on hand so I used onion, otherwise stuck pretty close to the recipe. It helps to keep the burgers held together if frozen first. Also, a well oiled grate and cooking at a lower temperature for a longer period of time works well. For best results, never cook venison beyond medium rare.

I took my son hunting in December and our host made PURE venison burgers, nothing added, so we used lots of ketchup in order to swallow.  After our trip I used this recipe and it worked very well.  For the purist is does make it a little less authentic, but I loved the combination.  I couldn't get shallots at the time, so we used onions.  This is also a great option for those who are not totally GAME on venison.

I don't like venison, but I make these for my husband and he loves them!  I didn't change anything about the recipe.  I've done these with beef as well and they're awesome!

I was a little skeptical about making venison burgers, but came across this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. It was soooo good! My BF loved it, even my very picky 9 year old niece liked it.  Will definately make it again!!!

When my dad used to make us eat venison when we were growing up, my siblings & I hated it.  A friend gave us some ground venison & allrecipes.com did not let me down.  These were easily as good as any beef burger I've had, & best of all my kids ate it without hesitation. Thanks!

Great recipe....  I agree that the burgers were a litttle large so I changed my last batch to make thinner wider burgers and grilled them a little less.  Perfect!!

Very delicious and juicy.  Made as per recipe and the burgers were huge (even for the hubby)!  Next time I will form 8-10 patties instead.  This is my attempt at trying more venison recipes with the freezer full of meat I have acquired!

Fantastic.  We had these yesterday for Easter Sunday grilling, and even the teens who were afraid of deer meat loved them.  Very tasty!

Great taste, everyone loved them..however our venison has alot of liquid so I added a handful of seasoned bread crumbs too....recipe was also doubled since we had almost 4 pound of meat.  Maybe next time I will use only 1 egg. This is a keeper.

The burgers were very tasty, not really gamey at all, I was pleased.
