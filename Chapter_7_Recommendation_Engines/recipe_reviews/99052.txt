Try soaking the sliced peaches in a lemon-lime soda (like Sprite). The acid in the soda keeps the peaches from turning brown as well as adding a bit of bite to the peaches.

this is my husband's favorite pie!  Summer just wouldn't be summer without the fresh peach pie.  I've made this recipe for several years, but with some changes... I do not add the butter, and I also add 1/2 pkg. of peach or white grape jello (SUGAR FREE) after the sugar and cornstarch boil.  
**A tip... sift the cornstarch and sugar together before adding water.  This helps keep the cornstarch from getting lumpy.

I've made this recipe for years, it was my Mom's. My birthday is in Aug. and I have this pie instead of cake. It's my favorite pie recipe. I leave out the butter though and use Splenda to cut down on calories.

If you want the real thing, I suggest using a recipe in which the peaches are baked. If you do make this, I found two reviewer's advice helpful. Coat all the peaches with the sauce before putting in the shell, and add a bit of almond extract for some extra flavor.

My family has made this recipe for decades. The only difference is that I add 1/2 almond extract. A nice touch is to add maraschino cherries for garnish. When I see fresh peaches, I immediately think of this pie. Delicious.

This pie was better than I expected. My cornstarch/sugar mixture never did boil; it just suddenly gelled.  So didn't get to cook a few peach slices in it.  I think next time I would just mix all the peaches in the cooled syrup, instead of pouring it on top.  It was kind of clumpy; I'd rather have it mixed in better.  Lots of compliments on the fresh, crisp taste of the peaches.

Recipe is really good, but instead of water buy peaches in syrup and use the juice instead of water really great.

This pie is awesome!  We have never liked cooked peach pie so this really fit the bill for all those fresh peaches in August. I made my glaze with half a cup of fresh sqeezed OJ and 1/2 cup peach juice from the sliced peaches.  It adds color and wonderful flavor too!  I would cut back on the corn starch as it was way to thick.  I ended up adding more peach juice as it was cooking and that worked out just fine.  Thanks for this "new" recipe,  We love it!!

This is really good and i don't even like peaches. I made this because I had  6 peaches that were going to go bad if they didn't get used, I didn't want to bake anything because it was 90 some degrees out. I had a few people try it and they loved it. I made my own crust from the website (Graham cracker crust I) They are so good together. The only thing I did differen was I put all of the peaches in the mixture of water, sugar, cornstartch and butter. I didn't have any problems at all with this recipe!!

If you prefer eating a fresh peach opposed to a cooked peach this is the recipe for you.  I can't imagine ever cooking the peaches again or using a canned peach.  After mixing the sugar/cornstarch together simply add the butter and water at same time and begin cooking.  I also add 1 tsp. almond extract after cooking the glaze.  If you soak the peaches in lemon-line soda which is a nifty idea/trick and it does keep the peaches from going brown, be sure to drain the peaches well or the pie will not set up properly.  I prefer using a pie crust rather then graham cracker but both are good.  It's easy, fast, and super delicious.

I did not like the recipe.  Perhaps if you know how to revise the recipe, it will be OK.  3 tablespoons of cornstarch is way too much.

If your peaches are ripe, this pie does not set up and is very runny.  I would not make it again.

Extremely easy and tasty. I made a pie crust with some left over flaky pastry, and as it is winter, I used a large can of peaches in juice.  I substituted the juice from the peaches instead of water, Splenda instead of sugar and added a few drops of almond extract.  I needed to add some extra water, possibly because the fruit juice was a little thick, and it turned out perfectly.  It took a bit of rearranging to get the mixture through the the layers of peach slices, so next time I'll put it on while the sauce is warm and put a top layer of peach slices on afterwards.

My boyfriend thought this was the best peach pie he'd had and he's had some good ones.  I loved the fresh peach flavor but the filling was pretty gooey, not smooth and pudding like which the picture seems to show...what did I do wrong?

I made this recipe, because I like the fresh peach taste, rather than the cooked peach flavor. I only gave it two stars, because, like a previous reviewer said, the sauce didn't boil, but turned to a thick gel.  I put it on the pie anyway, but we had to scrape it off before we could eat the pie, because it made it very unappetizing.  Maybe if you used about a cup of water and only 1 tbsp of cornstarch, you could pour it over the peaches, and it might work.

For a cheat pie this was great.  I still prefer the traditional baked one but this was a wonderful substitute.  On a hot day in the summer a hot oven is the last thing i want. Kids loved it and husband approved!

Although not pretty to look at, it is very good, w/a few slight changes. I used the lowfat crust, peach juice instead of water, 2 Tlbs instead of 3 of cornstarch and Splenda. Nice and low calorie.Could probably use a few more peaches too.

I loved this peach pie. I had some homemade baked  pie crusts already made so I used those instead of graham cracker crust. It was delicious. My husband loved how fresh and light it tasted. I followed the recipe exactly. I will make this a seasonal favorite every early fall. Make sure you use nice sweet ripe peaches.

This was nice and fresh.  I did simmer all of the peaches in the sauce before I put them in the crust.  And don't forget to bake the crust first!

This is a nice summer dessert when you have picked too many peaches.  I added the vanilla extract that another reviewer recommended, which was a great suggestion and a good touch.  Next time, I will try NOT waiting for the mixture to cool down before pouring in because it was clumpy and I could not get it to evenly spread through to the other peaches.  I will aslo try putting all the peach slices in the mixture so they all soak up the sauce because the way the recipe called for left several peaches tasting just like peaches off a tree versus peaches in a pie.

idk if I did it wrongly because I used corn flour but the mixture did not stick together well when it was cut, but it tasted good, so who cares?

This recipe was a disappointment.  The pie never set up...and...The taste was merely passable.

I didn't care for the crunchiness of the peaches.  This is just sliced peaches with some syrup on them.  Not my favorite but easy to make.

I don't know if it was a typo in the ingredients, but I made the cornstarch mixture with the 3T. as listed, and as others have said, it became a thick gluey blob.  So I put some of it in a bowl and then tossed the peaches with more on top, as to not bruise up the peaches.  

I only used 1/2 of the mixture, and did not put it on TOP of the pie, as there was no way it would seep into the pie.  Overall, it tasted good, but my expectations were higher for the glaze/sauce.  It was not runny at all, but thick. After setting in the refrigerator, the glaze takes on a whiter appearance as well.  It just didn't look appetizing to me.  I also squeezed some lemon juice on the peaches to keep them from browning before tossing them in the goo.

I didn't use the butter in the glaze and I mashed the slices of peaches in the glaze.  used a regular pasty pie crust bake and cooled. I also made homemade whipped cream for the top.It was delicious. I also sprinkled fruit fresh on the peaches to keep them from turning brown.

I will make it again,everyone loved it. The fresh  peaches were excellent so  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and  peach nectar instead of water. I did mix all the peaches with the  sauce before putting into the pie shell. quick and easy recipe that is sure to please.

Love the tips from others. Was desperate to do a quick dessert so I used frozen peaches didn't even defrost them (Sacrilege!), whisked the cornstarch with COLD water first then added to butter & sugar (which I cut in half and dropped some stevia in) before cooking, added cinnamon and a pinch of salt to taste, coated all the peaches and refrigerated 3 hrs.

Crust was the best part. The pie did not set, so it was a gloppy mess.  The taste was decent but it just didn't work.

This was just ok, save yourself alot of time and just eat a fresh peach. The peach by itsself is way better than this pie. Even my kids and hubby who eat everything just prefere a fresh peach to this pie.

I really liked this simple peach pie. You have to eat it all within a day or two otherwise the graham cracker crust becomes mooshy.
