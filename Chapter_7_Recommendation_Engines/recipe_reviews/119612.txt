I made an error, which I feel actually made the trifle better.  I'm not a coffee drinker, so I keep the single-serve packets in the house for company.  I cut open a few packets, as many as it took to fill 1/3c.  Then stirred this in the milk, and after I was satisfied it was as dark as it was going to get, I strained it out with cheese cloth.  Then I used this milk for the pudding and for soaking the cake during assembly of the trifle.  I feel it made it more "cappuccino" tasting and less "coffee" tasting.  Yes, a bit more work perhaps, but it's worth a try- really!  I've made it both ways and this way generates many more compliments.

It tastes so good and so elegant that you can hardly believe that it's just pudding and frozen pound cake mixed together in like 5 minutes!!

I made this for the first time today and took it to a potluck.  It got rave reviews!!!  The only thing I would change is maybe adding some finely chopped heath bar to it to add a little crunch.  Very good though!

This made quite a bit even though I reduced the recipe. Used only one pound cake and used a fresh one, not frozen, though that would be fine. I added more coffee because I thought it needed a bit more flavor. Good but I doubt I will make again.

I made this for a family gathering and it was a big hit.  I did change one thing, though.  Instead of buying pound cake, I bought   2 pound cake mixes and added about 1/2 cup of cocoa powder to the dry mix and about  1/8 cup of strong instant coffee graduals to the milk and mixed it in.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, though.  If you like
mochachino, you will love this.

I made this for a graduation party and it was a HUGE HIT!!!!  This recipe was so easy to make - I won't bother making traditional tiramisu ever again! I scaled the recipe for 24 servings and we have a small left over amount that will feed 2 people.  This was a HUGE HIT, it was easy and will definitely make again!!!!!!!!

So wonderfully easy and attractive to look at!!  I made this for a party I was invited to and it was praised by all.  The only change I made was to add 2 tablespoons rum to the cup of milk that was set aside.  It was very good, but next time I might add even more rum.  Wonderful recipe!

This was absolutely wonderful!  So easy to make with the pound cake.  I made it for a party of 20 people and they all raved!  I think it needs a bit more than 1 container of whipped topping.  Perhaps the larger size would suffice.  Great recipe that I will use again!

There was not enough pudding mixture or milk mixture to soak all of the pound cake. I only used 1.5 loaves and I found it to be quite dry. The pieces of pound cake that absorbed the milk mixture were very tasty. Next time I will either soak each piece of pound cake individually (as suggested by another user) or I will double the liquids.

For those not interested in heavy coffee flavor, I have always made this recipe with General Foods International Coffee "Swiss Mocha."  The mocha flavor mixes well with the cinnamon and cocoa.

I made this for a Christmas party & everyone loved it.  The only things that I changed were using cooking pudding instead of instant pudding and homemade whipped cream instead of whipped topping.

This was really good. I did use only one pound cake.  If I wanted a more, I probably would have used the 2 cakes and doubled the rest of the recipe.  16 oz of cool whip worked out just great for me.  I also used one pkg of chocolate pudding and one vanilla which gave it a little richer flavor. Overall, very simple and really good.

I got this recipe from The Pampered Chef a few years ago, and this has been my favorite dessert since then. Whenever I have to take dessert somewhere I take this and always have people asking me for the recipe and raving about how good it is. Try the recipe exactly before you start making changes.

I sometimes use mini dark chocolate chips instead of grating the chocolate square. I also use decaf coffee. I never have much to bring home from potluck dinners when I take this!

WOW !!!This is a great recipe nice change from the usual chocolate or strawberry shortcake triffle.  I made it non-dairy by using soy milk and non-dairy whipping cream I also granished the top of it with chocolate coffee beans.  It was loved by everyone.

Made this for a Bridal Shower of 20 older women.  What an absolutely wonderful dessert this came out to be and the easiest to do! The women couldn't get enough of it.  Good thing I doubled the recipe.  Also added large long stemmed strawberries on top for decoration! Now when I go to parties, this is what everyone asks me to make!

Made this exactly as recipe states with the exception of using Mocha latte granules instead of regular coffee. I'm not really a coffee person, but this was a huge hit with family and friends. Everyone actually skipped lunch and voted that we eat just dessert instead. I was asked for this recipe that night and I'm sure this is going to continue to be a huge hit.

Excellent!!  Like a lazy man's tiramisu!  Quick easy but very impressive.  I used fat free, sugar free jello instant pudding and fat free whipped cream (2 16oz TUBS!).  I would recommend letting it sit overnight so that the coffee really melds with the pound cake.

great dessert! i took this to a memorial day party and i had the first serving.  i thought it might have been a bit too rich for some of the guests, but when i was ready to leave, my bowl was EMPTY, so i guess not!  this tasted just like tiramisu, why would you even bother making traditional tiramisu when this is so easy???

This is delicious! Though I do use real whipped cream as I dislike the chemical taste of frozen whipped topping.

I got rave reviews for this recipe at the family Christmas dinner.  I drizzled a little Kahlua (about 4 tbsp) over the cake cubes before the milk/coffee mixture.  I think it was a great addition.

I have to make this (don't have a choice)for every family gathering. 
I love coffee so I add a little bit more coffee granules.
Delicious...

Good recipe with a little tweeking!  I found the coffee taste not strong enough so I used instant espresso coffee and it was much more flavor.  Making it for coffee lovers and getting compliments on it is definately a good thing!  I improvised when I didn't have any instant espresso at home and used the instant coffee with a liquer called Cafe Petrone (a coffee flavored liqour) also came out good

I didn't have pound cake but really wanted to try this so I used brownies and soaked them in a 1/4 cup of Kaluha. Then used three cups to make the pudding. I used an instant espresso for a more intense coffee flavor. My bowl was really big so I just made only two layers. I am anxious to try this with using the pound cake.

I substituted homemade chocolate pound cake and fresh whipped cream, and served this for dessert at a casual dinner with friends.  I was told that it was "the best dessert they had eaten, ever".  Delicious and super easy!

Delicious trifle.  I only had one tablespoon of the regular instant coffee granule left so I topped it up with french vanilla instant coffee, it was very good.  I would recommend making this early in the day to allow the cake to absorb some of the moisture or the pound cake tends to be a little dry.  Will make again.

this was delicious :) the cake was better the next day so i recommend to let the pound cake soak up the coffee flavor overnight.

I made this for an anniversary party, and everyone loved it.  We had it after the meal, and the leftovers were brought out the next morning to enjoy with coffee.  Just great.

I love this recipe. It is a Pampered Chef recipe that comes with the trifle bowl when you order it or it is in the celebrations discontinued cookbook. But it is a great recipe.
