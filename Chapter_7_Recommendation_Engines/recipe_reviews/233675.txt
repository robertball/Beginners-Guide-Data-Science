I was looking for a snack mix that would be relatively inexpensive and this fit the bill (buying 4 boxes of cereal and 3-4 other add-ins like peanuts costs a fortune). It looked like too much butter after melting, but it did all bake in and the result was crunchy and not as greasy as I feared. Cooking directions worked spot on. I think that Crispix cereal is a tad too sweet for my tastes, but I still liked the end result quite a bit. Following the recipe for cayenne and hot sauce makes quite for almost no heat. If you like a spicy kick I suggest adding more, but the other flavors are quite bold as advertised!

Was looking for a spicy mix for my guys. They said it was alright but not spicy enough and just cereal doesn't make it a mix. So I added 1 1/2 tsp of pepper sauce and 1/2 tsp of cayenne, plus pretzels and peanuts. I now make a batch weekly for my 2 guys.

I made this as part of a buffet table at Christmas - it wasn't good!  It may be because our Kroger store does not carry Crispix cereal, so I used corn Chex instead.  The cereal crumbled and fell apart and was unevenly coated with the seasoning.  Is there another brand of cereal that would work for this recipe?

This was tasty! I like that it only used 1 box of cereal, so I don't have to buy 9 million items just to make a bowl of snack mix. The flavors are nice, and the kids love it...That's good enough for me! Thanks for sharing. :)
