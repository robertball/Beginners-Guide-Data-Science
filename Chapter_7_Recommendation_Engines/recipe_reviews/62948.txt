Very yummy.  It is just a Bay Breeze with the addition of coconut rum.  For more fruit-punchy flavor, add a half ounce of grenadine.

First one was just so-so.  But this drink "grows" on you.  After a couple, it's pretty good!

This is almost identical to a Ruby Relaxer (one of my favorite drinks), minus the peach schnapps. Love it! Even without the schnapps it's delicious. My best friend found it a bit strong so doubling the juice doesn't hurt (I prefer mine stronger.) We evenly multipled each measurement to make a pitcher. It was a hit.

Delicious! 
It didn't quite fill the martini glass though, so I also added just a touch more pineapple juice and some 7Up to add a little fizz, I also added a splash or two of grenadine. 
With very little modification it's a great drink if you don't like the taste of alchohol!

A little sweet, but very good! I used 2oz of cranberry and added a couple cherries to ease the taste of alcohol. Yum!
