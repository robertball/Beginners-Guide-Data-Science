Wonderful!  I'm really picky about cobbler, so when I saw all great reviews I thought I'd try it, and it was great!  The crust was perfect. I did cut the bread into 9-12 cubed pieces rather than slices and also added a tad bit of vanilla and cinnamon to the sugar mixture.  This is an easy recipe that would be hard to screw up.  Good with or without ice cream/whipped topping.  Thank you!

Note:  I didn't have self-rising flour so I just used all purpose flour, added a pinch of baking soda, a pinch of paking powder and a dash of salt.  Seemed to work just fine.

UPDATE:  I've made this several times since, and still love it!  Everytime I take it to parties or anything, people always ask me for the recipe.  Be sure to drain the peaches really good just so it's not runny.

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe,used a 9x13 glass pan, reduced sugar by half & added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the sugar mixture. 45 minutes is exactly the right baking time, making the crust really light yet chewy.  My husband has already declared this a favorite.

This was really good. It was such a surprise that white bread was the cobbler. Nobody would ever have known if they hadn't been told. And my husband almost didn't believe me that it was just plain bread. However, I did use fresh peaches and I wonder if that was why the cobbler came out runny. It had a lot of liquid in the dish. I thought maybe it would set up but it never did. I will make this again with canned peaches and see if I have the same problem. And due to other reviews I decreased the sugar to 1 1/4 cups of sugar. Next time, I will try just 1 cup. It was pretty sweet. I highly recommend this very easy and tasty cobbler!

This cobbler turned out beautiful, tasted GREAT and was so easy to put together! Added a can of apricots with the peaches (sliced fruit up a little thinner). Left about a 1/4 cup of the syrup in the fruit, I like it juicy. Cut the bread into cubes. Also cut sugar to 1/2 cup - didn't use full amount of butter - added a dash of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. This is one of those recipes that you can put together quickly and always have the ingredients on hand. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. This recipe is a keeper.

Very good!  1 cup was plenty of sugar.  I used frozen peaches and blueberries, because that's what we had on hand.  Next time, I'd cut the bread in squares rather than just strips, to make serving/eating easier.

OMG!!! this is SSSOOOO good.  i read the reviews first and the common issue was to decrease the sugar, add vanilla, and add some cinnamon so i did that the first time around.  it is a hit!. i am having some VIP's over for dinner tomorrow and was afraid because i never made this but i told them in advance i would make cobbler, so i frantically looked online for a reliable recipe and boy did i hit the jackpot.  i will be a star tomorrow. thanks!

My family liked this very much!  I will probably use less sugar next time as I found it a little bit sweet for my liking.  I used frozen peaches (thawed) and maybe that is why?  I will make this again many times!  You'd never know that white bread is used in this.

I was skeptical about this one but was in a hurry for a desert. Well... 3 people managed to kill it, only crumbs were left! :) I did read the other reviews and cut down the sugar to 2/3 cup, then added about 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. after putting it all together I sprinkled the top with cinnamon. WOW! I'm making it again this weekend.

I gave this 5 stars for ease in preparation, taste and appearance.  I used two cans 29 oz. of sliced peaches drained.  Used 1/2 c. BUTTER because I had no margarine on hand, 4 T self rising flour and 1 egg.  Recommend you cut bread into strips or cubes for a nicer presentation.  Oh, I also sprinkled my peaches with brown sugar and cinnamon.  This is a keeper!!

Very good! It was gone quick and loved by everyone. I'm glad I read the reviews first. I used 1cup og sugar instead of 1 1/2 and it was just as good. It's a keeper.

Great recipe!  I have tried it twice in the past week and prefer fresh peaches to canned.  It really made a HUGE difference.  We doubled the recipe and used 8 big peaches.  It worked out perfect and was the hit at my wifes get together!

As most of the other reviews said, his was really delicious and really simple.  I followed a few suggestions, like adding cinnamon and vanilla.  I also used hamburger buns because it was that or wheat bread.  The sugar topping made the buns taste like warm fantastic  glazed donuts.  My boyfriend and I loved this and will absolutely make it again.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I made this dish to bring to my boss's house as dessert. Everyone loved it, however, the only criticism was that it was too sweet.  I took others' advice and cut down on the sugar, but it still was too sweet. I had put one cup instead of the one and half cups called for in the recipe. I also added cinnamon and vanilla to the egg, flour, margarine mixture which helped. I would definitely make this again, but I'd cut down on the sugar even more.  I served it warm (a must) with vanilla ice cream on the side...delicious! One other thing...the house smells great while it's baking!

This was my first cobbler I have ever made! I had a few over-ripened peaches and knew that over-ripe fruit is great to bake with.  Also having moved, I don't have anything so the less the ingredients, the better.  I did what others said - used only a cup of sugar and added vanilla and cinnamon.  I ended up baking it a bit too long and the bread turned a bit into toast....plus I think the pan I used was a bit too big but otherwise, this tasted great!  I also had some frozen blueberries/strawberries that I added in....I will definitely make again - couldn't have been easier!

This was really good!  I made some modificaitons per others' recommendations.  I added 1/3 white sugar and 2/3 brown sugar.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, a dash of cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  I added some pecans too.  I'll definitely make this again.

When I saw this recipe I immediately thought of the bakery cinammon swirl bread I had in the kitchen.  I used that and fresh fruit, and it is just wonderful!  Thanks for the easy dessert.

I thought the crust turned out really well, but it never set up.. I drained the peaches really well, but it stayed soggy. I will try it again someday. The recipe is good, just didn't set up.

So good! I made it for a potluck at church. IT was the favorite. Today I am going to try to make a vegan version for my vegan dad - I'll let you know how it goes. I have also made it with other fruits: berries, apples, pears... Yummy!

I just made this cobbler and everyone in the family LOVED it! I ended up using whole wheat white bread...it made a kind of chewy crust. But we really enjoyed it.  It is really sweet, and I too will cut back on sugar the next time I make it. I also think the Texas Toast idea from another user is a  great idea! YUM!

Doubled recipe, except for sugar, only used 1 cup, added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon to the egg and butter mixture. Saved juice from drained  peaches. Cut peaches into smaller sizes Used a full loaf of Texas toast, trimmed off crusts and broke bread into pieces. Once assembled, poured approx. half of peaches juice over top and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and chopped pecans. Baked in 9 x 13 glass dish for approx. 45 minutes. Delicious!

Yummy!  This was so simple and quick. I followed others advice and I cut the sugar to 1 cup. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 3/4 tsp cinnamon as others recommended. It came out perfectly and tasted awesome!  Because I am currently without a kitchen during a remodel I made this in my BeVille toaster convection oven and cut the time to 30 minutes. Perfection.  Thanks for sharing this!

Could be a great recipe, but too sweet. Use about 1/2 the sugar and I believe this would be a wonderful cobbler recipe.

I make this for company all the time.  It gets rave reviews and it is so easy.  I generally cut the sugar as it seems too sweet if prepared according to the recipe.

This was wonderful and very easy. It was a bit sweet. I think next time I will also reduce the sugar to 1 cup and cube the bread instead of strips just for ease of eating. I did used wheat bread instead of white and I could tell no difference. It was great!

My coworkers LOVED this cobbler!  It is very easy to make.  I used only 1 cup of sugar and added a little nutmeg and cinnamon to the melted butter mixture.  I also added grated pecans on top before baking.  Fabulous recipe!

This recipe was super easy and so good!! The white bread made it delicious - so good that my cousin said next time skip the peaches and just make the crust. 

Definitely didn't need all the sugar the recipe called for. I used a bit under 1 cup, and it was still sweet and delicious. Added some cinnamon and had this with ice cream. YUM.

I am sitting here enjoying this cobbler as I type. Just like most of you, I was surprise about using white bread, but I am a believer now. I grew up eating my momma's peach cobbler and consider myself to be a expert on what it should tast like. "This is one of the Best" and I highly recomend it. I did cut the sugar back to only using one cup, that was sweet enough for us and I used 3/4 of the juice from the can peaches, because I like my Cobbler a little juicy.

I only gave 4 stars since I altered the recipe some. I put this in the crock pot because I cook a lot with it. I did not put the butter in the bottom, just greased the crock, drained the peaches well and threw the rest in. I did cut the butter down to 1/3 cup. I sprinkled about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon a good sprinkle of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. vanilla on the peaches before adding the bread and flour mix. I cooked on high about 2 hours, then on low for a little while longer to help it firm up. Husband said he couldn't eat anything else again after eating this. I thought that meant it was pretty yum!

I thought this was fantastic!  I used a 16oz bag of frozen peaches (didn't thaw) and added about 1 1/2 c. of blackberries.  I cubed the bread, which seemed to work well.  I did use all the sugar (I used splenda) called for and used the "homemade" self rising flour with a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking powder!  It's a new staple in our house!

I made this last week twice!! Once with peaches and then with berries, my family LOVED it!! My Grandmother who is famous for her Peach Cobbler was extremely impressed with this recipe!! The recipe must be good if she loved it!! The only thing I added was cinnamon, vanilla and a little nutmeg into the mixture which gave it a little more flavor. Other than that it's a great recipe!

Fantastic!  I modified it by using frozen sliced peaches (approx 4 cups, didn't thaw  before using), reducing sugar to just 1 cup, and adding cinnamon & vanilla.  I used homemade bread, but didn't count the slices.  I tore the bread into smaller pieces, rather than strips as some suggested.  Wow.  Can't wait to have it again.

I found this recipe to be very quick and easy, and everyone loved the cobbler. The topping did not appear to be bread slices--a nice bonus as it looked more complicated than it really was.

I used canned peaches and drained the juice, as the recipe suggests, and there was no shortage of juice in the final product. If you don't drain much, you could be faced with a soupy cobbler.

I will be making this often.

This is a yummy cobbler. I cut the sugar to 1 cup, used butter instead of margarine and added vanilla and cinnamon to the wet mixture. Who knew bread would make a great topping?

This recipe turned out really good. However it was really really sweet.  Next time I make this I would cut the sugar to 1 cup and make sure the peaches are either freshly cut myself or a can with no sugar added.  Other than that it turned out really good.

This was a very nice take on peach cobbler. I kept most of the recipe as is but I did take the advice of some of the other reviewers and I cut the sugar down and added vanilla. I may use texas toast or french bread next time to make this more of a breakfast item. :-)

So yummy--I was skeptical about using the bread, but it completely changed texture and taste.  The only reason it's 4 stars is because the recipe does call for too much sugar.  I'm a fan of sugar, and I don't believe I've said something was too sweet more than a couple of times in my life :)  Next time we'll cut down the sugar (I did read that other reviewers suggested that, but I assumed it would be fine for me)

This is a fantastic one!  The bread adds a crispy element to the cobbler that we all fight over!  We do it with just about any kind of canned fruit -- peaches, apricots, plums, etc.

Super easy to make.  I used about 1/2 cup to 3/4 less sugar and it was still tasty.  I'll definitely make it again and again.  It tastes even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

I changed just a few things, but you really can't go wrong with this fantastic recipe!

First I arranged the peaches (with just a couple of teaspoons of it's own syrup) into the baking dish. Then I sprinkled just a little bit of cinnamon and caster's sugar on top, and stuck it in the oven for 5 minutes to warm them evenly and make the overall texture less soggy. Then I put the rest of the ingredients on top and baked it for 35 minutes. The bread strips made it look great, and the flavor was just absolutely perfect.

Awesome recipe.  The whole pan is gone already, I'm about to use some frozen strawberries for another batch.  I used fresh peaches.  Hint: if you place fresh peaches in boiling water, the skin peels right off.  I also cut back the sugar.  YUMMY!!!

this is great! I even doubled the recipe but not the sugar. I made a separate one with splenda brown sugar (1/2cup) instead of sugar. it was awesome! My family wants me to make it all the time!

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I made it for dessert when I had friends over for dinner and when they left there was none left.  I was suprised how good it was with the bread, i did how ever use regular all-purpose flower becuase i didnt have self rising flower.  I think people who cook alot or bake alot i should say would have that on hand.  There is nothing i would change, it was very delicious!

Really easy and delicious! I only had a souffle dish that was about 6" round but I layered the bread deep and it came out fine. I added fresh raspberries upon request from my family. I may next time cut the sugar by half and then use half light and half dark brown sugar. Thanks for such a delicious recipe :)

Can you say sugar butter. Too much butter, the whole thing tasted like it. It was a novel idea with the bread cobble, but it that didn't fly at my house. My family couldn't even eat it, a total waste of materials.

My mother-in-law is revered for her peach cobbler, but now my husband's family is asking ME to make it because of this recipe!  I made a few changes - I cubed the bread instead  of cutting into strips, cut back on the sugar, and used thawed frozen peaches because I prefer a fresher-tasting peach.  Obviously, it turned out fantastic.  This recipe is a great "jumping off point" for other possibilities . . . apple? cherry?  I can't wait to experiment with other fruits.

I have to say this was better than I expected! I had fresh peaches to use and was in lazy mood and thought this would be a so=so way to use them up! Boy was I wrong, this was excellent! The bread was yummy and sweet and a little crisp.   LOVED IT!

I thought the batter was way too sweet; made my teeth curl. I used 2 15-oz cans of drained peaches but if I make again, will use a lot more peaches.

Oh my god!!! This is so good. It turned out super watery, so I had to drain some of the liquid off. I drained it while it was hot and bubbly still, so it reduced down to the perfect gooeyness that I wanted. 

I had some obstacles! All my fault, though. I started making this before I saw our 1 week old loaf of bread had already gone moldy. I ended up using hamburger buns. Yes, hamburger buns. They were egg buns so they were really sweet and I can't imagine it a different way. I also accidentally added too much flour. The lid fell off! I added some vanilla extract and cinnamon. 

If all of this went wrong for me and it was still fantastic, you should try it!

I made this dessert as shown - did not cut the sugar and wish I had... it was a little grainy even.  Next time will cut the sugar and try with the vanilla and cinnamin as suggested before.  Definite "keeper" with some minor adjustments.

The easiest dessert I've ever made and by far, the yummiest. My husband said that this was the best dessert he's had in his life, and he REALLY meant that. It's so easy!! I halved the amount of sugar asked for in the recipe and added a touch of cinnamon and vanilla extract. Delicious. I'll always keep canned peaches around now!

This was good.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and doubled the recipe adn cooked it in a 9X13 pan. I also cut the sugar in half and added vanilla and cinammon.  This was still a bit too sweet for me, even with 1/2 the sugar.

This was wonderful!  My husband loved it and asked when am I going to make it again.  My father-in-law had no idea I used bread.  The only thing I did was double the batter because it just didn't seem to be enough, reduced the sugar to 1 cup, and I added a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon.

This was my first time EVER making a cobbler & it was super EASY. I modified the recipe in this order: First my pan was only an 8x8 1. After draining the peaches, I kept the juice. Sprinkled a thin layer of cinnamon and brown sugar (about 1/4 tsp each) on the peaches.  2. Due to the size of the pan, only used 4 slices of bread and cut bread into cubes instead of strips. 3. Cut the white sugar down to 3/4 cup 4. Added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the sugar/flour mixture. 5. Before baking, I poured about 1/4 of the juice from the peaches on the top. Baked for 45 minutes, then another 5 minutes on 425 to get a crispier crust. House smelled delicious!

So so easy and really a good taste. I made mine by making my peaches the way I normally do and then just following the instructions the rest to the way. I like my peaches cooked down in brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Of course I don't measure just everything to taste. But I was very surprised at how good this was. The dough was the taste I've been looking for for years.

I made this for the 2nd time today and I used 3 15oz cans of peaches. I poured the first 2 cans into a buttered dish and covered that layer with bread squares and drizzled the bread with melted butter and sprinkled cinnamon before covering the layer with the sugar mixture. I poured the 3rd can on top of that and repeated the same step. covered, baked it and it tastes even better than the original recipe. but don't get me wrong, i like the first recipe but I like more cobbler than what the first recipe recommends.

Excellent and easy! I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and cinnamon and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Since our toaster oven was used, probably baking should have been cut to 30 minutes but a little crunchy was no problem at all. It did turn out to be fairly runny, but again, no problem. Thanks for the recipe - I've already passed it along to a couple neighbors and am sure I'll make it again myself.

The best!!! Used with fresh peaches (4 peeled and diced). Altered recipe and used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 stick butter. It was plenty sweet and was crispy on the top. Will be making again for sure!

Excellent, quick, and easy. I felt like a real chef. I am a dough person, so next time I'll probably add more white bread. Thank you so much for this wonderful dessert. I will be doing zumba three times a week after this!!!!!

Loved this; though I made it my own by using a can of refrigerated Pillsbury biscuits for the topping. I broke them into pieces and placed them on the peach mixture. Then I sprinkled slivered almonds on top.

followed the reviews and used less sugar and was just right. i added vanilla and a dash of brandy to the mix and it was fantastic. also used a duck egg but only because thats all i had but they're really good for baking.

This turned out wonderful! The only reason i did not give it five stars is i added cinnamon and vanilla to the mix. instead of can peaches i used a 16 oz bag of frozen peaches. So Simple and Everyone loved it!

I have made this over a dozen time times, and each time  have gotten as many compliments as the last. The only thing that I do differently is use fresh peaches and shimmer them in a little cinnamon powder instead of using canned peaches. I tried it with canned peaches the first time and this way all the others. It is better with fresh fruit.

Didn't have enough frozen peaches to double the recipe (family dinner), so used a can of drained pineapple tidbits. Buttered a 11x13 glass casserole dish, sprinkled with about 2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar over the fruit. Replaced self-rising flour and the sugar with 3 heaping tablespoons of Devil's Food cake mix (didn't have self-rising); increased egg to 2, but kept the melted butter and the bread the same. It was fantastic! Next  time I will add pecans.

After almost an hour trying to figure out if the ingredients were accurate, I just gave it a try. I had no idea I wouldn't have to use as much flour. THE BREAD WAS THE COBBLER! It wasn't droopy, it wasn't too sweet, it was juuuust right. I've learned to read reviews before I cook something, and I'm glad I chose this recipe... COMPLIMENTS WAS GIVEN TO ME ALL EVENING!

This is a great recipe - I actually chose this one because most of the other recipes called for baking powder which I did not have!  I used Splenda in place of the sugar - granulated measures cup for cup.  I also used fresh peaches.  I had nine medium sized ones so had to make two batches of the topping to cover the bread to my preference but I will definately make this again!!  My husband's was raised with his grandma's Tennessee southern Peach Cobbler and he LOVED it!  Thanks for sharing!

This is absolutely amazing! My roommates loved it. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and the butter (I used butter instead of margarine) to a little less than 1/3 of a cup. I also added in 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. For cinnamon, I actually forgot to add it into the butter and flour, so I sprinkled them on top right before it went into the oven. It worked out surprisingly well.

I agree with other reviews that the recipe as is has too much sugar in it, so next time I make it I will decrease it to 1 cup. Otherwise, the result was amazingly good and super easy to make!!! Great new version for my recipe box.

I made this with "white wheat" bread, which is maybe why it didn't come out so good. Tasted like I was eating bread with peaches. I probably won't try it again.

Topped with whipped cream it was easy, tasty and enjoyed by all. I did take advice from most of the reviews and only used 1 cup sugar. Next time I will add a little vanilla and cinnamon. My granddaughter went home with the recipe in hand ready to delight her friends.

Peaches just arrived and they were fantastic in hand but were getting to be a bit overripe.  I just made this, I had to substitute pancake mix for the self-rising flour, other than that, followed recipe exactly.  It is rather wet, which may be because I used fresh peaches, but oh my goodness, this is fantastic!  And so easy!  It is still warm in the bowl next to me as I'm writing this.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I had doubts about the bread at first, but I needed a dessert really quickly and had almost no flour so this fit the bill.  It is really fantastic.  A little too sweet the first time I made it, so now I reduce the sugar, I cube the bread and toss it with the sugar and egg and all that, and I had a little cinnamon or apple or pumpkin pie spice, whichever I have on hand.  I have never used self rising flour in this recipe though, I usually just  a pinch of baking powder to the flour and it works fine.  I awesome quick little recipe that I now always keep everything on hand for.

My cobbler came out a bit mushy. I didn't like the added slices of bread. Overall, the taste was so-so. I would try another recipe.

I made this peach cobbler for my birthday club.  I served it with vanilla ice cream. They loved it!  My sister told me it was the best dessert she has ever had at birthday club.  I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups and added some cinnamon and vanilla. My husband loved it too!

I usually screw up anything I bake, but I was in charge of making a dessert for a small potluck. And this turned out beautifully!! I adjusted the recipe to serve 8, used a 9x12 pan, and based on all these members' suggestions, I used 1 tsp each vanilla and cinnamon, and only 1 cup of sugar. It was a smash hit and unbelievably easy! I am definitely making it again and experimenting with other fruits. Thank you!

This recipe is so good it made my boyfriend cry when he talked about it. Of course I took notes from the other reviews by using a 8x8 pan, a little  cinnamon and vanilla(I even ripped the bread slices up in 7-8 pieces on top).I have fixed this peach cobbler at least twice a week with no real effort!! This recipe is no doubt a big hit!!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was so easy and delicious.  My husband and I both say this is a keeper!  I never would have thought of white bread as part of a cobbler, but it definitely works.  I'm going to try it next with fresh peaches or blueberries.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for my family for Christmas and it was a huge hit! I couldn't believe how easy it was to prepare and I must admit I was skeptical. Being a born and bred Southerner, we take our peach cobbler pretty serious, with that being said, my crowd loved it!

I had fresh peaches instead of using canned - used about 5 of them.  I did add cinnamon and a pinch of clove to the peaches, and finished the bread topping with a sprinkle of Turbinado sugar.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I had to add about 15 minutes to the overall bake time to get it golden on top.  Was the BEST cobbler I've had in years!

This is so easy and impossible to mess up. The only changes I made was switching the sugar to splenda(about 1 1/4 C), the addition of about a tsp of vanilla and added about 1/4 cup of the peach juice to the batter and it was amazing. I will be making it this way from now on.

i made similar changes as per the other's comments.
cut some of the white sugar & replaced with brown, added vanilla and cinnamon, diced the peaches, tore the bread instead of placing strips, used the peach syrup (which i also added some on top with the sugar mixture , i also added more cinnamon & a little pumpkin spice on top, and i added some bread pieces down in with the peaches).  tonight will be my 5th time making it, it's so yummy.

I love peach cobbler but had never tried to make it.  This was as good or better than the best I've ever had. Couldn't have been any easier to make. I did add some cinnamon to the topping but other than that, followed the recipe. It wasn't too sweet and the  top crust came out perfect.

07-09-16 ~ This is my favorite way to make peach cobbler. My grandma didn't like to cook/bake, but she looked forward to fresh peaches every summer to make this dish. I made it with fresh peaches rather than canned. I had a leftover loaf of French bread that I used. I don't trim the crust as we like the chewy factor that it adds to the cobbler. Cobblers don't get any easier than this one, rather you use canned peaches or fresh. It is wonderful warm with vanilla ice cream! I don't cover the leftovers, if there are any, as the bread gets soggy. We like it chewy like it bakes up on the first day.

I often mess recipes up, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good and easy this was. I used wheat bread instead of white because that's what we had. It was still delicious!

Oh my gosh!! Just made the best peach cobbler ever! Made it with fresh peaches from my tree. Peeling was labor intensive, so appreciated that the recipe itself was quick and simple. I tore my bread into chunks and substituted  wheat bread, it was great! I also sprinkled a liberal amount of cinnamon on top before popping in the oven! Yum!!!

I usually read reviews before I try a recipe.  This time I did not and wish I had.  It was overly sweet.  Next time I know to decrease the sugar by about 1/2.  Otherwise a good and easy cobbler.

I made this recipe, tripled it for a party we had, there was like 1 serving left. It was great. Closest to "homemade" using canned peaches. Didn't notice the "white bread" in the final product. Crust/top was amazing. Added a dash or two of cinnamon and nutmeg to final batter before pouring over peaches. Thank you so much for this recipe!

So yummy!!!  Make sure peaches are well drained.  I double the recipe and make it in a 9x13 pan.  I also use less sugar than called for (2 cups instead of 3) and it's plenty sweet.  Easy and delicious!

I had been up to No. GA and had plenty of peaches but Never made a cobbler. I found this to be excellent! Very simple and fresh. I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup and added some cinnamon to the top, it was very good, a keeper.

This was good and definitely easy but a bowl of plain peaches would have been just as good.  Sorry.
