The tuna egg salad is a simple recipe I grew up eating. If you are making the bento box for the next day, I would suggest you store the tuna egg salad separately and place the salad in the tomato the day you are going to eat it. Enjoy!

I grew up eating egg in tuna salad, and I thought it was a great idea to put it in a tomato. However, I didn't have one, so I spread the salad on cucumber slices instead. It worked great, but I'd like to try the tomato sometime. I cut back to only 1/4 c mayo, and it was still very creamy. Also, I just sprinkled on some salt and added black pepper too. The salad made a big serving, so I didn't see the need to add another egg to the Bento. I finished the box off with carrots, blueberries and grapes. Thanks for the recipe and the ideas.

My daughter loved this lunch. I didnâ€™t have a heart-shaped form for eggs and just added whatever fruit I had on hand. Thank you for the recipe.
