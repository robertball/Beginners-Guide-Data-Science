Had a party and everyone loved it!  I had frozen veggies in the freezer and did as suggested. I may add less cheese though.  I have vegetarian friends and they were able to chow down on this so I was relieved (it was a BBQ)!

It was very quick and easy to make - only about 5 minutes per quesadilla - and you could customize the fillings!

Excellent!  I also added 1/2 cup of shredded garlic jack cheese, made a mixture of guacamole, sour cream, and salsa, and also served the condiments separate.  I just prefer the mixture, but know some people don't like guacamole.  If I can't find garlic jack cheese, I just sprinkle lightly with garlic salt. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe and perfect for a quick lunch or snack!  This was very eaty to prepare and the combination of colors and flavors not only made this very appetizing but tasty too.  I opted for light Mexican blend cheese and used two tortillas to make it more of a "quesadilla". Perfect with homemade salsa, quacamole, and a dollup of light sour cream.

This was our lunch today--just using random leftovers in the fridge. The corn I used was Mexi-corn and I used pepper jack cheese. We did need more cheese. We liked these. I served ours with a mixture of a dip made of reduced fat sour cream and homemade salsa. NOTE: Assembly is a little easier if you mix the corn, bell pepper, beans and corn in one bowl, then spoon the mix onto the tortilla in the skillet. Then all you have to do is spread it out and sprinkle with cheese.

I added cilantro to this recipe, which was a very tasty addition.  This is a great way to cut down on the cheese in the typical quesadilla. (I used less cheese than was called for.)  Very fresh tasting and reasonably healthy.

Simple, tasty, and so easy to make.  We cut the tortillas in half, then folded each half over while it was on the griddle so it was more like a true quesadilla.  I served them with salsa and sour cream.  I reheated the leftover ones in the toaster oven the next day for about 4 or 5 mins. and they tasted just as good.  Thanks!

I liked how quick it was to make, but actually when I followed the recipe exactly, it tasted very blend. I suggest you use salt and pepper, or serve it with your favorite salsa.
I used a little bit of fresh cilantro, too.

These were so simple and yummy, I have made them over and over again.  It's one of my favorite lunches.  I usually don't add the corn, but I do add some cumin and chili powder for extra flavor and always some picante sauce.  Thanks Hydeeho

This is an old tried and true favorite.  Adding other veggies that you like also can not go wrong.  Experiment with cheeses too.  Yum.

This is a great recipe!  I used lettuce leaves as wraps rather than the tortillas.  I also added jalapeno peppers and substituted mushrooms rather than the black beans.  SO GOOD!! Sour cream and salsa on the side! Yummy!

I've made many versions of this now and it remains a favorite dinner choice for me and my husband. I like that this recipe is easy to manipulate and that you don't have to be precise. As is is great, but when being "lazy" we just sprinkle on and eyeball cheese, corn and beans. But we've also added ground turkey burger, or turkey lunchmeat cut up to get some protein, and I've been wanting to try some black olives or mushrooms with it. Thanks for the recipe!

We turned these into more of a burrito.  Quickest dinner ever, tastes good and is meatless - that's a great combination!  I just rinsed and drained a can of black beans and another of corn, stirred in some dry taco seasoning and nuked for about 1 1/2 minutes.  Put this mixture into large tortilla shells, added salsa, cheese and sour cream and rolled up.  So good!  We didn't have any red pepper or green onion but I'm sure they would be tasty also.  Thanks for the inspiration!

I didn't follow the measurements just threw in what I had. This was very good served with some salsa and sour cream. Just as good without the black beans.

I just started adapting a vegan lifestyle and this is a great recipe. Of course, I omitted the cheese (used nutritional yeast in place). I used the whole can of corn and black beans and adjusted the other ingredients to fit. I added some jalapenos to spice it up and dipped in guacamole. This mixture is also good inside a pita with slices of avocado. Yum! Thanks.

Not very flavorful. It needs some seasoning mixed in with the veggies. I found that drizzling Cholula liberally on the finished quesadilla added some good flavor.

It turned out great. I bought Southwest corn +green and red bell pepper cans from Safeway. Also the tip to put it in the oen for 5 mnts or so was awesome. The quesadillas were crispy.

Tasty and easy - just watch the tortillas like a hawk while they're cooking to avoid burning.  Substituted various fresh/frozen vegetables for the frozen blend suggestion - where are you supposed to find corn, peppers and beans in one frozen bag?

This was good, just not outstanding.  I used my homeade fat free refried beans instead of black beans, and I just sprinkled the cheese on, so I probably used less.  I liked the bell pepper and green onion flavors.  I baked mine in the oven to make things easier on myself.  Had this with rice, beans and guacamole.  Great meal!

Good recipe but needed extra flavor. Next time I will add some spice to the veggies. I didnt use onions or pepper, as the man I cook for dislikes both. I added shredded salsa chicken instead and it gave it the extra flavor it needed.

These were good. I made them with the Santa Fe Chicken salad and it was a super easy & delicious meal.

These were so good.  I made them in my quesadilla maker.  It was so easy.  The only change I made was using frozen red and green peppers and onions, instead of the green onion and red bell pepper. TFS.

This, um, didn't quite come out right. When I slid it onto the plate, the edges had all flopped in on the middle and there was corn and beans all over the place. I tried to flip it onto another tortilla, but that didn't, um, adhere to the stuff in the middle and when I took a bite the bottom tortilla just stayed on the plate. It was very good though. I agree that some of the portions were too large. Next time I'll use a bit less of the ingredients. Except the cheese. Gotta use lots of cheese ;)

It was okay. Not as good as I had expected; I think too many ingredients were used in such a small space, and all the tastes just sort of overwhelmed each other. I even used pepper jack cheese instead, and added chopped kale. I'd make it again if I had the ingredients and nothing to do with them, but probably cut the quantities in half.

This is a great recipe.I opted for whole wheat tortillas. I also jacked up the heat with a pinch of cayenne pepper and cumin-salt mixture.

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times and it always pleases my picky family.  I'm the only one who loves cilantro, so I custom make mine loaded with it!  My husband gets extra jalapenos and my boys love to drizzle BBQ sauce on theirs!  It's easy and fun to make!

Brilliant, easy dish for the midweek slump when you don't want to really cook, but are also avoiding eating out on the town! And, as other users have mentioned, VERY customizable! This is one of my husband's new favorite meals.

Omg, I have made these quesadillas so many times! I was given the recipe at least 10 years ago. I assumed, the girl had thrown the recipe together. It's a handy, when there isn't much in the house to eat. I have never had measurements. I just add to taste the above ingredients. 1 1/2 cups of the beans, corn, and red peppers seems really excessive. I would say I sprinkle about 1/3 of the suggested amount on the cheese before adding a top tortilla. I typically mince the red pepper too, to make sure it is fully cooked. Trader Joe's homemade brand tortillas, are my favorite to use with this. When I have had leftover meat, that I broiled, I have even added a little of that. Although, it makes a fine vegetarian quesadilla as is.

Attractive, filling, tastes great.  Topped with sour cream and avacado mixed w/picante sauce.  Mixed all the veggies, then eyeballed the amount of cheese.  I know I could have gotten a lot more than four servings (I was the only one eating).  Thanks for a tasty menu idea.
