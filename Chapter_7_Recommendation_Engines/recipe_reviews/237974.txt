YUMM!! this was so flavorful and simple to make!! I used heavy cream and skipped adding the flour. I also just added a little more orzo, chicken and corn to make it more like a stew. Delicious. Perfect meal for a cold day! I will be making this again!

What a great comfort recipe- and perfect for a cozy dinner inside on these cold winter days.  I followed the recipe in all, except for substituting the lemon juice with 1/2 the amount of vinegar b/c I was out of fresh lemons (1 Tbsp. vinegar). I added 1/2 a red bell pepper chopped and sauteed with the onion and garlic (its a personal preference but it adds a nice color variation to the soup). Also, I omitted the 1 Tbsp. flour b/c I used the regular heavy whipping cream, not the 10% cream. (Most will have reg heavy whipping cream in their fridge I think.) Next time, I will add shredded carrots along with the corn. Thanks for sharing!

Really great recipe! I didn't change much, except that I used a little extra chicken broth (I had some leftover), and some extra flour to compensate. I also added spinach and a little feta cheese. That really made the dish for me: the extra spinach added some color and taste, and the feta made it even creamier!

This soup was delicious - just not thick enough per the original recipe. I added a second T of flour and still couldâ€™ve used a bit more thickening. But otherwise a fantastic recipe, my family ate it up and went for seconds!

Excellent  soup!  It reminds me of Avgolemono soup which is one of my favorites.  I made it exactly as directed using left over store rotisserie chicken instead of raw.  My only slip was with the dill.   Although I used dill from the produce section, it was the stuff in the jar and all I had, so I used about an 1/8 of a cup and I think it was too much - I shouldn't have dumped it all in like I did.  I still liked it as I like dill, but next time I will use more restraint so any others eating the soup will enjoy it a bit better :)  I can't wait to make this again!
