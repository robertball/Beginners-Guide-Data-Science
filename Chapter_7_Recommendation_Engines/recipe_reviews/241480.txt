I made this with all the same ingredients and added just a few others. First I seared the lamb, set them aside, and sauteed the onions and garlic. Instead of transferring everything to a different baking dish I just added the wine and stock into the same pan, moved the onion mixture to the sides and added the lamb back into the original pan (I started with an ovenproof pan with a cover. One less dish to wash.) I added carrots and potatoes for the last hour and a half. Again, less pots and pans and they soak up that wonderful juice. When ready, I plated the meat and veggies, turned the stove to high, and added a tbsp of corn starch mixed with a half cup of cold water to the remaining juices in the pan. I added a tsp of Worcestershire sauce, some fresh chopped parsley and mint, let it thicken and poured this lovely sauce all over the meat and veggies. Garnish with extra mint and parsley and you've got yourself a 5 star restaurant quality meal there!

Awesome for Passover! Omitted onion and garlic altogether. Seasoned with rosemary, mint,  thyme, salt & pepper.
Used balsamic vinegar in sauce instead of Worcestershire.

This was my first time making lamb, so i had no ideal how to cook it. I came across this recipe and I made this tonight only change I made was I used sherry instead of wine because I drank all the wine we had left. Everyone loved it and I will be making this again. Thank you

I added my own twist to this incredible dish. I followed the original recipe but added mushrooms when I sautéed the garlic and onions. I’m sober and couldn’t emotionally hand alcohol in my home, so I omitted it, and substituted an additional cup of beef stock in it’s place. After an hour and half of braising in the oven, I added diced purple potatoes and corn of the Cobb I’d also cut in sections. I continued braising the lamb with the added potatoes and corn for the remaining hour and half.

This was the best way I have ever prepared lamb shoulder chops! I did substitute red onion for yellow as that's our preference, and I added a tsp of dried mint to the chops. I served with my own roasted fingerling potatoes and broccoli and my husband couldn't get enough. The gravy was amazing, the lamb tender and succulent, the seasoning perfect! Excellent meal all around.

Have made this twice, perfect results both times, never any leftovers, no matter how many chops go on the platter. The gravy alone is divine. First time I made it, didn't have beef stock, so I just used more wine, worked so nicely I just did the same second time around. Prepared this tonight for a family dinner and knocked their socks clean off! Braising time is the whole 3 hours, this is not a Wednesday night dinner for a working family, but it sure makes sunday

had to change, didn't have beef broth or red wine, substituted 2 cups of water with 1 pkg of mushroom gravy mix and 1 generous Tablespoon of the moist chicken broth Better than Bullion.  So liquid remained the same, 2 cups.  Everything else I had.  
It was delicious, totally tender, cooked exactly 3 hours, probably was done enough at 2 hours.  This is a keeper.

I made this in one pan (for easier clean-up) using my cast iron skillet.  Didn't use Rosemary and used all beef broth because I have no wine on hand.  I then added potatoes and carrots at 1 1/2 hours.  My family loved it!!  The meat was so tender.  Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe. minus the rosemary, I love lamb. They came out tender but the flavor of the lamb that I like so much was gone.

We will definitely make it again. I've never made lamb shoulder chops and my husband brought them home from the store so I used what I had on hand. I used marsala wine instead of red, I used white onion instead of yellow, added fire roasted tomatoes, and used all dry seasonings because I didn't have fresh. I served crispy porcini truffle gnocchi under the chops with the gravy and were used mint jelly on the side to add some freshness. It turned out Great! I would have given it 5 stars but since I improvised I wasn't sure if their recipe was better.

This was very moist and tender. The gravy had good flavor. We all enjoyed it and will have it again. I made the recipe as written, but added mushrooms as another reviewer had done.

Absolutely delicious. I used 2.5 pounds of bone-in lamb shoulders. I added coriander and thyme and took out the wine and Worcestershire. I used an extra cup of beef broth in it's place. After 90 minutes of roasting I added half a pound of sliced bella mushrooms. For the gravy I took up as much liquid as I could and added half a cup of beef broth. Delicious recipe that I'll make again and again.

I used Maggi deviled sausage mix  instead of all the single ingredients because I didn't have some of them. I did use red wine, onion and garlic. They turned out perfect. I also used fresh mint rather than Rosemary. I also used mutton chops  with all the fat left on rather than lamb, Which to me is tasteless anyway.  You have to get that from a butcher as I've only ever seen lamb in a supermarket. PS: Not for health freaks.  If we die of a heart attack at least we'll die happy.

Just wanted to share a tip with anyone thinking of making this.  There are two types of lamb shoulder chops.  One is called the O bone or round bone and the other is called a blade chop.  I strongly recommed the round bone chop over the blade chop.  It has more meat and is more enjoyable to eat.  The blade chop can be scrappy and fatty.  There is very little difference in the price of the two.  Bon appetit!

This was a great recipe....however I did not have time to braise it in the oven.....so I used my instant Pot (electric pressure cooker) and set the time for 30  minutes.  The lamb shoulder chops were so tender!  I also did not add the water.....so I did not have as much liquid.  Very tasty recipe.

Did not change any thing in this recipe as this was the first time trying it.  May try cutting the Worcestershire a little as it was a very strong flavor. Overall, very tasty dish.

Used sherry and white cooking wine instead. I also cooked everything in a Dutch oven like many reviews suggested.  Thought I made extra, but it never stood a chance. Delicious and easy, I will be on the hunt for more lamb shoulder. Picture was right before oven entry.

The texture came out great, but this came out bland as hell. I recommend combining the wine and broth in a separate bowl/cup, and giving it a generous amount of seasoning that you'd like to add to it.

This came out very well indeed - every bit as tasty as the more expensive standard lamb chops.  I'll definitely make it again!

Fabulous recipe!  This was my first time making lamb and unsure of which recipe to use; I am so glad I chose this one!  I made a couple changes...I marinated the lamb in the red wine with the garlic clove and some rosemary for about 1.5 hours, being sure to remove garlic and rosemary before browning in my cast iron pan.  Since I used the cast iron pan I was able to use the same dish for the oven roasting.  i poured the wine garlic rosemary marinade in with the lamb onions and broth just as the recipe called for.  The lamb was so tender it fell apart as I was playing it.  ABSOLUTELY delicious!  I also topped it with fresh mint sprigs which paired fantastically.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe!!!

I changed the recipe a little, just got back into town and did not have any beef broth so I added a can of diced tomatoes after  sauteing some chopped onions & garlic.  Transferred that to a roasting pan added the chops and baked for 2 hrs at 300. came out very tender. will make again

I could not remember if I liked Lamb or not-someone who did not like it gave me some so I tried this recipe-it was great!   Probably not a huge lamb fan though-but this recipe is a winner.

I made the dish in the Dutch oven to have less pans to wash.  I’d agree with the reviews stating that 3 hours in the oven is too long.  My lamb was falling off the bone after 2 hours at 300.   I used two cups beef broth & one cup red wine to make sure everything was covered.  I added a few sprigs of fresh thyme when cooking the vegetables.  Added my carrots to the chops at the one hour mark, and garnished with chopped fresh mint.    I served with mashed potatoes.  I will definitely make it again!

Wow that was really good. I just didn't make the sauce thick at the end. But delicious. And definitely falls off the bone.

My alterations:
- Used a straight sided oven safe saute pan, so no need to transfer to a baking dish. 
- Chicken or vegetable stock can replace the beef stock if none on hand.
- Thyme works if no rosemary on hand.
- Don't really need to thicken up the sauce, but can also create a roux with flour and using the liquid to create a similar gravy.

Very good.

Awesome! As suggested by others, I used a single cast-iron skillet, cooked two chops for 2 1/2 hours, and added Yukon gold potatoes and carrots for last hour. Seared chops in olive oil and 1 tbsp butter and included 1 tsp fresh thyme with the rosemary. Finally, I added fresh parsley and mint to the gravy. Great meal along with Greek salad.

The gravy was all dried up, the second time I did (and every time since) I doubled the gravy and swapped wine for a dark beer ( pale ale or porter). Also do all cooking in a Dutch oven. It is awesome

Family loved it.  I added Thyme as well.  And I cooked it in a dutch oven.  I had to add a little more red wine and beef broth to cover the meat.  I did what others recommended and added potatoes and carrots for the last 90 minutes.  It was perfect!  I will make it again.  It did turn an inexpensive piece of meat into and excellent meal!

Made this tonight. I would definitely add more beef broth/stock & wine. Be sure to drain the grease. Maybe use a leaner cut to eliminate the heavy grease.  Smelled wonderful while cooking. Served with mash potatoes.

Wow!!!  I made this for my husband and myself for supper tonight and we were blown away with how good it was!!!  I usually have to make changes to recipes to make them more to my liking, but the only thing I would change about this is the baking time.   I checked it after being in the oven for 2 hours and 20 minutes and it was falling apart by then.  So I turned the oven off and finished up the rest of the meal.  It was fantastic!!!

This  was the most tender lamb I have ever eaten.  Like others, I started it in my cast iron skillet, so I just put that in the oven and covered it with the lid.  I did not have red wine and instead doubled the beef broth.  Also, I was out of Worcestershire sauce, so a added a small bit of A1 sauce instead.  Added some baby carrots  for the last 45 minutes. 
Absolutely delicious and the house smelled so good while it was cooking.  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! The only change I made was I skipped the cornstarch slurry, as it really wasn't needed. The lamb chops were so flavorful and tender. I added some mushrooms to the onion/garlic mixture, and then added some potatoes and carrots to the pan half way through the cooking time. Next time I will add them a bit later, as the potatoes and carrots were a little over cooked and falling apart. I'd probably add them about an hour before the cooking time ends next time. This one is definitely a "do again"! Thanks for the recipe!

Just served this up for dinner and it's a keeper for sure! I took some hints from Justjoy's post and used the oven safe pan to save on the cleanup. I also added the carrots as she suggested a half hour before it was finished. I used baby carrots and they were just perfect. The only things I did a little differently from the recipe is I added a little more garlic powder and season salt as I was making the gravy.  Also, our chops were about a 1/2 of an inch thick so I cut a half hour of cooking time off and it was perfect.
My husband makes the world's best mashed potatoes and they were a side for this meal. We put the gravy on everything and it was absolutely delicious. 
As just Justjoy said it's a five star restaurant meal that you can make it home with very little effort. Will definitely be keeping this in my recipe file.

Definitely a repeat recipe when lamb shoulder goes on sale again! I first seasoned the lamb well with black pepper, jamaican allspice, salt and some dried herbs. Then browned it in a mixture of butter and olive oil, instead of vegetable oil. I sauteed a generous amount of red onion (instead of white) + garlic and shallot. In addition to the fresh rosemary, I also added some dried mint to the lamb before sticking it in the oven. The gravy took longer than 5 min to thicken, so I would allow more time for that part. Otherwise, great recipe - will make sure to add some potatoes into the dish halfway through next time.

Made this for dinner, absolutely loved it! The meat turned out very tender, the bone easily pulled out right after cooking. The fat rendered nicely, and it was very easy to make the gravy. The only change I made was adding some milk (not much only a splash) to the gravy to make it a little creamier. Next time I want to add sautéed mushrooms to the gravy!

Followed recipe as written and loved it! Falling apart tender, onions melting and sweet, gravy delicious. Will make again--in fact, soon, for a dinner with extended family.  We had a delicious arugula, tomato and bacon salad, which I would make again, and will probably add either mashed potatoes or rice.  I used just one pan, a cast iron skillet, for all the steps, and it worked very well.

I made several changes (partly because I forgot to put the tin foil on and the liquid reduced too much) but everyone wants me to make this again and again exactly the same.  Followed the recipe exactly at first (except for adding 1 1/2 tbsp dried rosemary, not 2tba fresh).  Put it in the oven, remembered at 2 3/4 hours it was supposed to be covered with tin foil so I took it out.   Took the drippings, 1/2 c Cabernet, and 1 c beef bullion, added 2tbs cornstarch to 1/2 c cabernet until well mixed the added that to the rest of the liquid.  Added about a teaspoon more dried rosemary, more pepper, garlic salt, salt, and used more balsalmic vinegar instead of worsteshire. Reduced a built, then added 2 t of sugar.  WAS PERFECT!!!  IEveryone agreed this was one of the best meals I have ever made!!!  Thanks so much!

It probably doesn't take a full 3 hours, but it doesn't hurt.

Wow...I made this assuming it was going to be mild...but this really had no taste. I doubled the onions and garlic, and generously added the salt and pepper...but this was beyond bland. Not a keeper at all.

I made the recipe exactly as stated and I was not impressed. Either 3 hours was too long or 300 was too high but the liquid evaporated enough to scorch the top. Unfortunately I was dealing with kids so I relied on the timer but should have taken it out 30 min before the timer went off. 

The meat was tender though so I would like to try it again with some of the recommendations. The gravy was ok, I would have liked something else to offset the Worcestershire sauce, so again I would like it try this others  recommendations.

It was too delicious to describe. Rich flavor, tender meat - I could eat it every night of the week.  Will be serving this to guest for sure, most of the prep work is ahead of time so you won't be stuck in the kitchen while your guests are enjoying themselves.

Love this recipe. It's so simple and yes I modified it ever so slightly. Cooked it all in the one pan and added an extra cup of a very nice 'Cabernet Sauvignon' and when I added the corn starch I also added Balsamic Mint Sauce. Result was absolutely magnificent and I will definitely be doing it again.

FABULOUS!  It falls off the bone, only need 300* (I did 325 for 1 hr- could have stuck with 300 I believe).  I used 1 pot with a lid for initial smear step, to put in oven, then to dip out of. Smelled yummy and tasted fabulous.  didn't have corn starch so dipped occasionally.  Another review said to add carrots and potatoes, I think that would be a good idea for future makes of this recipe.  I took a photo. THANKS! 1st time making lamb and it was great

OMG! I made this for dinner this evening and what a hit. The lamb was so tender it fell off the bones when I was taking it out of the pan. It is very flavourfull and the gravy was fabulous on the mashed potatoes. I will definitely make this again and will be one of our favorite lamb recipes.

I will be making this every Sunday!!!!  My husband is picky and said I should make it again. I did what another reviewer did and added potatoes the last hour of cooking. Then for the sauce I added fresh chopped mint and oregano, then garnished with fresh mint and oregano. I was worried the mint would be too much, but it was amazing. I love this recipe :-)

Followed the directions, except added 3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar. They came out super tender and falling off the bone, as promised! Next time I would like to try this recipe in my crockpot instead of the oven for 3 hours.

We love lamb and found some lamb shoulder cuts on sale (not the best cut).  Forgot to buy onions but doubled up on garlic and herbs.  Used LOTS of rosemary and also 2 tbsp of chopped fresh sage (i own a herb box!) - and stuck into oven at 325 F for 3hours.  The meat texture was great, it was falling off the bones - so tender! - but not flavourful enough - would consider pre-marinating next time.  
For the glaze, I added 50% more worchestershire sauce, plus a tiny piece of rock sugar to the reducing liquid before thickening.  I think the glaze has a little too much cornstarch for my liking.  Maybe just start with 1/3 or 1/2 play it by ear!

Only changes were using white onion (because I had it), and, instead of the half cup water, added more beef stock.  Was fabulous!

Question: I normally marinate lamb overnight, would this recipe be affected badly if I did this ...? Does this mean I have to sear the chops before marinating or afterward? Hmm this sounds obvious but want to hear from others ...Planning to follow directions but add a few flourishes mentioned in previous comments -- adding fresh mint, fresh oregano and rosemary ... marinating in red wine vinegar ... salt, pepper ...

just okay- Ill admit i'm not a huge lamb fan, but my husband is and it was on sale at our local grocery so I decided to give it a try. I added the thyme lke some others suggested, other  wise followed the recipe.  Smelled great in the oven, but came out a bit bland. Tender and fall off the bone, but not a lot of flavor.

This is delicious!   I did not have beef stock so I used Beefy Onion Recipe Secrets mixed with 1 cup water.  I also used white cooking wine instead of red.  It came out tender and juicy oh so good.  The flavors were iresistable.  This is my new go-to-recipe!
