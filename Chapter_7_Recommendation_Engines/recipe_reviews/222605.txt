My family completely devoured this casserole.  As usual I did make some changes.  I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings, left out the onions, and used home made cheddar cheese sauce.  Had I used velveeta or cheese wiz it probably would have been inedible at my house, but for those who like processed cheese you would probably like the recipe as is.  The only thing that would make it better is some buttered bread crumbs on top (they make all casseroles better!)

The only reason why I am marking this as a 4 is because I did not add all of the ingredients or follow the recipe to the letter. I did not use onions or chives. I really just guessed at all the measurements of ingredients also. I used 9 pounds of potatoes, 16 ounces of cheese sauce and sour cream. About 1 cup or a little more of mayo. I just kinds of threw it together, and it was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe.

I reduced this recipe down to two and half lbs. of red potatoes. I also didn't have any processed cheese so I used all cheddar cheese. I really was lazy and felt the potatoes would cook in the oven without pre-boiling, so I just cut them into small bite sized pieces, greased the pan real good, mixed everything up and threw it all in the pan. I cooked them for 60 minutes covered at 350. I did take them out halfway and stir them so they wouldn't burn on the bottom. They were cooked just right, fork tender, without pre-boiling.   I do think they needed some more seasoning, the only reason for 4 stars. We do like Velveeta and I'll try them again with some, but if you're not a fan of processed cheese this recipe works fine without it.

I've made this recipe several times now for family get-togethers. Both times I followed the exact recipe, always feeling like I've made more than I should.  I've yet to bring one bite home. Buy a aluminum foil roasting pan, with a lid and you won't be left with dirty dishes.  I do suggest baking it on top of a cookie sheet so the pan doesn't buckle when you take it out of the oven.  It's delicious, absolutely delicious.  Just don't cut corners on the bacon or cheese.  I would suggest doubling the chives, they really bring out the flavor.

We substituted some Philadelphia cream cheese alfredo spread/sauce (because that's what we had in the fridge)for the cheese sauce and it was delicious.  I did boil the potatoes ahead of time and scaled down to a smaller batch size.  They were delicious.

Substituted some sliced green onions (tops only) since I was out of chives.  Took it to a Sunday School party - a  hit!  Got requests for the recipe.  Thanks for posting it.

Great potato dish.  I add other items like: sauted fresh mushrooms, red bell peppers, chopped garlic, etc.  It works beautifully.  Enjoy!

This turned out AMAZING. Both me and my husband loved it. Made a few simple changes. I used a bag of the real bag bits instead because I HATE cooking bacon. I used Velveeta cheese in place of the cheese sauce and added more sour cream and chives. Will definitely be making this again.

Like another reviewer, I made my own cheese sauce out of sharp cheddar cheese. I made this dish for a family gathering and everyone was raving about it. I will definitely make this again.

Must do modifications-add one packet of ranch dressing mix, reduce potatoes to about 5-6 pounds, boil potatoes in 1 tsp of crab boil.  (cross referencing another recipe)  Reducing the amount of potatoes makes for an extreme creamy sauce. I used 1/2 box of Velveeta but chopped small blocks.  Before cooking, I chopped 1 stick of margarine and placed on top of the mixture.  Even with the reduction of potatoes, it made a large 11x13 dish stacked high plus an 8x10 dish on the side for another meal.   GREAT!

I have been making this recipe for over 20 years now, and it is amazing every single time.  There have been times I have switched up the cheeses (except for the Velveeta, it just doesn't taste right without it) and added a little cumin and made it into  a Mexican dish and it has been great that way too!!

Scaled down recipe, but kept ingredient proportions the same.  I will make again.

This recipe was an awesome  addition to our campground's Memorial Day picnic.  Next round I may add more bacon and boil the potatoes for slightly less time and let them finish cooking while the mixture is baking.

I tried this recipe because our chives just came up and I didn't know what to do with them.  I set the serving size at 10, and it was perfect.  I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it, and had to substitute 1/2 a can of cheddar cheese soup for the processed cheese, and it still was awesome.  I also cut the potatoes before boiling them for 10 minutes, and baked it for only 30 minutes, and it turned out great.  New family favorite!
