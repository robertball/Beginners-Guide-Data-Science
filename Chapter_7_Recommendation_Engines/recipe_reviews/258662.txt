This was excellent! I am growing okra in my garden this year for the soul purpose of pickling it. Pickled and in gumbo is really the only way I've liked it in the past. Until now. This recipe blew my socks off. Honestly, I don't think it even needs the thyme and rosemary. I used it but it was just as tasty straight off of the grill. I will be making this often over the next couple of months. 5 stars all the way!
