Was very good. I used chicken stock instead of water and I put whole onions and garlic cloves in the steamer basket to help flavor the meat. I served it withe roasted vegetables and rice. Tasted fantastic!

I thought this was pretty good. I omitted the salt completely and just added a pinch of it while it was steaming. What is the point of rubbing it in salt and rinsing anyway??

Good- just way too salty. Any ideas for brining instead of marinating in just salt? The texture came out great.

i agree with other comments about the chicken being too salty. i tried brining it with an equal amount of sugar and immersed it in cold water but it still came out salty for my taste. my husband who loves his salt loved it though so i am giving this four stars. this might be good with a little ginger too.

I used electric steamer for 30 minutes. I used thighs and drums without skin. I had no sesame oil but it still tasted delicious. Will try again with sesame oil and rate again!

Good simple recipe. I skipped marinating in salt completely and used a thigh and leg piece. Delicious!

I used a half cup of coarse kosher salt and a half cup of sea salt and it turned out great. Don't use regular table salt it is not the right kind of salt to use for any kind of Asian rub or marinade. I gave it four stars because the recipe didn't specify that. Otherwise the chicken kept moist tender and juicy. Keeper recipe and I will try it with ginger next time!

I only did steps 1 and 2 then added the chicken to canned MaeSri Tom Kha soup. I used about 1/2 cup salt for 200 grams (0.4 pounds) of sliced chicken breast meat. It turned out great flavorful and not overly salty. I did stick to the 30-minute refrigeration mark and rinsed it pretty thoroughly.
