Absolutely enjoyed it! I did make a few small changes, such as no corn/corn byproducts because of allergies, and honestly, who needs cheap fillers like that with all of the other good stuff in this recipe? Used smoked spices because I didn't have liquid smoke, (I also blackened the smoked spices onto the pork roast when I browned it, which was amazing.) All in all, I look forward to making it again!

My brother-from-another-mother won't give me his Abuela's secret recipie; but this was close enough that it curbed the cravings!
