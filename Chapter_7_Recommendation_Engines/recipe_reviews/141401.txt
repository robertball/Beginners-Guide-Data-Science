Just okay for me, but maybe it was my fault.  Our chicken breasts were enormous, so the chicken to apple/prosciutto ratio was all off.  Next time I'd use smaller chicken breasts or more apple stuff.  Gravy didn't really add anything...  Would make again with different ratios and a different gravy.  Thanks!

I altered this version quite a bit, but mine turned out amazing! I didn't bother with the sauce or apple pie spice. I just stuffed the chicken breasts with chopped granny smith apples, 2 thin slices of brie, and the prosciutto, then added a splash of balsamic vinaigrette to each chicken breast before baking. My husband and I both LOVED it and it will be making regular appearances on our menu now!

This was a great recipe. Just add some white cheddar, more apples and salt. The white cheddar gives it just enough sharpness. I just brought it to a couples get together and it went over well.

I cooked this for my kids and myself and they liked and so did I! This was not bad at all. I added just a little bit of shredded mozzarella. I also used more apples and apple pie spice than the recipe called for. I used Gala apples but I think that I will use an apple with a little more flavor next time. I also sprinkled the rolled chicken breast with a touch of season salt. Otherwise, pretty good!

First time around we made the recipe exactly as written with so-so results.  The chicken and stuffing was good, but that sauce hide all the delicate flavors under a blanket of bland.  So we tried it again last night without the sauce.  We also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic before stuffing.  MUCH better!  Quite tasty, in fact.  We still want to play around with the seasoning for the chicken, maybe try McCormick's Garlic and Herb seasoning instead.  But this is still a lovely meal.  Just don't ruin it with that bland sauce!

pretty good, but not fantastic...needs a little more something...tiny bit bland, but we ate it all anyway...I'm thinking the sauce needs some zing.

Tried this last night.  Excellent!  Easy to make and "wowed" my husband who is not a big fan of chicken.

I drizzled maple syrup over the chicken before I put it in the oven, and then more before serving, as the sauce was inedible.  Very tasty chicken - but avoid the sauce.

This recipe was lovely -- very light and fresh-tasting.  I would definitely recommend a few changes, though.  For one, I think "apple pie spice" means different things for different people.  I used cinnamon, mostly, but also some ground cloves and allspice.  I couldn't find the nutmeg, but a little bit of that would have also been good.  Second, I used way way more apples than this recipe called for and I still thought a little more would have been yummy.  Definitely be liberal with your apples.  I chose three varietals: gala, granny smith, and golden delicious.  They went well together.  Finally, I think the sauce could have used some salt.  All in all, this was a fantastic recipe-- what a great combo!  So thanks to the author for sharing!

This recipe could use some adjustments for flavor.  I love apple and prosciutto, but the flavor was lost in the chicken.  I couldn't taste it at all.

I don't know what it was missing but it seemed very bland to both of us.  I had high hopes for this but it just didn't turned out.  It came together beautifully but the flavor just wasn't there.  Maybe after I experiment with it a bit I'll change my rating but as is, not for us.

I made this dish for guests, and they couldn't stop raving about it.  The flavors blended together and compliment each other wonderfully. This recipe is definitely a keeper!! I have also done this with adding a stick of string cheese rolled inside.  Yummy!

i initially scrolled right pasty this recipe because the picture seemed to show the recipe with apples  as a side dish and not inside the chicken, however now that i came back and checked it out further i see its potatoes on the side, i guess maybe next time i will try this recipe but will pass on the potatoes as they dont seem like they would mix well with such an already mixed flavored dish.
