Delicious! I did have to use canned pineapple, but I was sure to drain it well. I do have to admit that I did not bother measuring the cream cheese or pineapple, and just eyeballed it. Very tasty, warm and comforting...the chocolate was a nice addition at the end. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

As written this is not a make-again for us. "Good bread" wasn't exactly specific enough - we went with Texas toast, but probably should've used challah or French bread for this. I also personally didn't care for the combo of pineapple and chocolate sauce - but I did use fresh pineapple, canned would have been sweeter and probably tasted better. With the bread you would normally use for French toast (if you have a regular type you use) and a strong liking for the pineapple/chocolate combo, this could be quite delicious. It smelled amazing cooking!  As written it just wasn't for us. Thanks for sharing!

I definitely should have used better bread. I just used the regular honey wheat I had at home.  Lol. The recipe came out well.  Very rich, but delicious!
