This recipe is delicious. I use reduced fat cream cheese instead of fat-free (I've never found fat-free cheese appealing) and I add a little splash of milk to my food processor because the ingredients are too thick and because I prefer to use the recipe as a creamier dip rather than a spread. I served the feta dip with the Pita Bread Bites from this site. It's one of my favorite appetizers. Yum.

Wonderful!  Although  I would eliminate the salt and pepper at the end, I felt it tasted better without.  Still a very handy recipe, thanks!

I love cheese, so it comes to no surprise that this is a favourite! I would cut back on the salt and pepper at the end though, might have been that my feta was salthy enough. Thanks for this quick appetizer!

This is fantastic! I just whipped up a double recipe only I used plain feta (because that is what I had on hand) then I added some dried basil and garlic powder. I followed the advise of other reviewers and did not add salt. I can not wait to bring this to the bible study picnic tonight!

My rating for this as written is just 3 stars. The feta made the spread way too salty, so I doubled the cream cheese. That made it better, but it still needed more "zing," so I added some sun-dried tomatoes, which did the trick! My co-workers cleaned the dish right out in record time! After my tweaks, a strong 4.5 stars!

I have been making something similar for years. I use a whole block of reduced fat cream cheese and add the garlic and herb feta to taste. The salt and pepper aren't necessary. You should microwave it to combine the flavors or bake 350 for 20 minutes. I serve with plain pita chips and diced tomato and black olives.

I served this at a family reunion and averaged the response. Most said it was missing "a little something".  Maybe the addition of something with a little bite would satisfy those needing it. I liked this dip, and would make it again.
