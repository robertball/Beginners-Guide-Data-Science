The flavor is good but a little too crunchy for me.   Just a matter of personal taste.

Great Cookies!  They are very "hearty" - probably due to the wheat germ.  They have great texture and are easy to make.(I managed to make 96 with this one recipe, using tsp drops)

These cookies are fabulous!  I have to hand out copies of the recipe every time I bring these cookies someplace. 

 They are crunchy; I've tried shortening the cooking time a little in hopes of getting softer cookies but haven't yet succeeded.
  
  I use my stand mixer for this recipe and would recommend this over hand-mixing.  The batter is quite heavy.  However, it would be possible to mix it by hand, just a little more elbow grease involved.  A great recipe for the entire family to help with (esp. the stirring)!

I don't usually review recipes but had to on this one. It's PERFECT! I have been looking for the perfect recipe that will turn out well even if I change it up a bit. I'm a cake person and use a product called creme bouquet and half of the vanilla in most recipes. It worked very well in this. I also only had choco-peanut butter chips available so I used those.  This recipe is great. I only needed to cook them 10 min. but my oven is always too hot.  THANK YOU!

These were a big hit! I used butter flavored shortening and the cookies were delicious. I halved the recipe because I wasn't sure if the family would like them. Even with just half, I had 52 cookies using a small cookie scoop.

These are wonderful little cookies. I like my cookies more crunchy and crispy, so they turned out great. However I followed the recipe exactly and made a whole lot more than 60 cookies. People love the rice crispy cereal in the cookies and ask me left and right for this recipe, so be prepared!
