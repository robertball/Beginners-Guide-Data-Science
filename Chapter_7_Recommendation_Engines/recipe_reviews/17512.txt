I made this 6 times over the past two weeks. I did not want to add a bunch of stuff like others did as I didn't want to turn it into a Mexican Bake - I really wanted that "pure taco taste". The recipe as it is - not really spicy spicy at all, and the tomatoes and onions on top don't really give it enough freshness like a real taco. After the second try I used medium taco sauce and then on top of the meat mixture layer I spread a layer of meduim thick and chunky salsa, then the cheese, etc. I found an 8 oz jar of salsa takes care of it. The salsa really made the difference - tasted very fresh and just a hint of spiciness but not at all hot, my whole church group ate it up and asked for the recipe.

We liked this alot, just made it.  Kind of spicy but accidently used medium sauce and a 16oz jar at that.  I think that when I make it again I will use mild sauce and the 16oz if I would've used any less it would have been dry.

I thought this was okay but my roommate LOVED THIS.  He swore it tasted just like a poco loco dish he orders at a local mexican restaurant.  I used 1 1/2 lbs beef, added 1 can refried beans (when I added the taco sauce/seasoning) and used cheese flavored doritos. I served over lettuce and green peppers with a dollop of sour cream while my roommate poured red enchilada sauce over all.

Very good! Tastes just like regular tacos, but provides something a little different. It's fun too, you can eat it with a fork, or your fingers. Nice change from the usual.

Really good!! I added a layer of refried beans and used a box of tostado shells instead of the taco shells.  Served it with chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, sour cream, and extra salsa.  Everyone loved it!!

Wonderful.  I added black beans as one of the layers to kick it up a little.  Never-the-less, it was wonderful, and nothing was left!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I added a can of refried beans to the soup mixture and stirred it well before putting in the casserole dish.  I also dribbled a jar of salsa in the middle layer of the dish.  It really helped spice it up.  I also served it with tortilla chips since it is almost 'dip-ish'.  It was good!  Add a salad and some hot queso for chip-dipping and you've got a great meal.

Cooked this recipe on two occasions. First was for the kids at my daycare center where I work and the second time was for my family. I would suggest using 25% more ground beef per serving since I ran out at end and had to use extra cheese for top layers. Also, the diced tomatoes are excellent and should be used with beef and onion when layering. Turned out very good second time around.

The first time I made this it was a little bland. Since then I've spiced it up a bit by putting a can of spicy rotel tomatoes in the mixture, along with one can of mexicorn. I also use the hot taco sauce instead of mild. It's a big hit at our house!

This was a wonderful recipe! Instead of using taco shells, I used small soft tortilla shells and doubled up on them between layers.  They weren't soggy at all and the final result reminded me of a mexican lasagna.  I did add in a can of drained corn to give it some veggies.  This is definitely a keeper and three of us finished off most of it!

Quick, easy and tastes good!  I added a tbl of tabasco and used nacho chips (didn't have tortilla chips) and it turned out great.  It only fed four though; I would double if serving 8.

A very flavorful, yummy recipe!  I served this at dinner with my in laws, and they all really loved it.  I think next time I might just make it without the taco shells, and serve it over tortilla chips.  We topped it with sour cream, and it was completely delicious.  Next time I think I'll try it with avacado as well! :)

We enjoyed this and it was relatively quick and easy.  I did add a can of refried beans to the meat mixture and layered in some salsa.  Next time I might use tortilla chips instead of taco shells since it's about the same effect and probably more cost-effective.  I did use 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef and thought that was the right amount.  I served it topped with green onions and sour cream.

I didn't care for this at all.  The taco shells were soggy and I found it to be too much hamburger.  Won't be making again.

I seeded and diced about 8 Heinz Nacho Jalapeno Slices and added them to the beef, onion and garlic. This gave it a little more kick without being too spicy.  I served the remaining black olives (chopped), chopped tomato, green onion, thinly shredded lettuce and sour cream on the side. It was wonderful! I was afraid that it was a little too dry when I was putting it together, so I added another 1/2 cup of taco sauce.  Unfortunately, this made the taco shells too mushy.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.

I loved the taste but didn't like the texture because of the tacos. Next time I would omit them and serve with tortilla chips. We found it served 4-6.

I am a college student who usually never makes anything more than ramen soup or tuna fish.  However, I made this for my family last week and it was great.  It is so easy to make that even a novice cook will have no problems.  I accidentally added hot sauce instead of the regular, but my family ate the whole thing (and they never eat my cooking).  This is a great recipe that I would definately recommend to anyone!!!

The entire family loved this.  I've made it three times in 3 weeks.  The best part is that it's so easy, my 5 year old can do a lot of it.  She loves to feel like she's helping, so I let her break up the taco shells and layer in the cheese.

I loved this recipe it was quick and easy and my whole family loved it, the only problem was that it wasn't enough for all of us! I also added a layer of sour cream and salsa after it was cooked and then put on the tomatoes, chive and olive!

VERY good and easy to prepare.  I had to tone down the spices for a few at my table, but I will be making this dish again!  The second time we made it, I doubled the recipe because we all wanted more leftovers.

When this casserole came out of the oven, it didn't look too appealing.  I told my husband that our six-year-old would probably take one look at it and say he would not eat it.  I am glad to say I was wrong.  My son LOVED it.  It had a really good flavor and wasn't too spicy.  Topping it with sour cream and black olives made it even better.

The recipe was very good - I substituted corn and green pepper for the olives & chilis. But this recipe DOES NOT make 8 servings. I used 1.25 lbs ground beef and this was still barely enough for 4 adults. Good thing I had also made a big salad!

I accidently added 2 cups of water instead of one so I had to take out some liquid, and the baking dish I have is 13.5x9.5 so I could only do one layer, and it still turned out great. Tasted just like tacos. I used Rotel instead of green chili's though and left out the onion, and I probably used more than a cup of cheese. My husband loved (though my 2yr old wouldn't try it) so we will definitely be making this again!

Very tasty and a nice change from the ordinary casserole!  We've topped it with other "taco toppings" once it's out of the oven: shredded lettuce, sour cream, and of course the tomatoes and olives.  Yum!!

My small group loved this at pot luck supper!  I used taco shells on the bottom layer and tortilla for the second layer and top.  I mixed a can of corn in the beef mixture and added a layer of refried beans, extra cheese and some whole black beans for fiber.  A great recipe to change around!  I'll make this again (and probably a little different every time)!  Susan in Pomfret, Maryland

What a nice change of pace of the usual tacos.  Instead of using taco shells, we used the store brand tortilla chips.  I doubled this recipe for my large family.  My 5 kids LOVED it so much that next time I make it, I will have to triple it!

Excellent flavor and so very easy to prepare.  However, the recipe would not feed 8 people.  I fed it to 4 and had just enough.  Will continue to make this.

In some parts of the dish the shells were not that crunchy.  It did have a good flavor and I will make it again because the hubby and my 2 year old really liked it.  I did not add the green chiles though.

I love how easy it is to throw together and everyone loves it.  I have added Refried Beans to it and it adds a "little extra"

Easy and a kid's favorite--much easier to deal with than traditional tacos.

This recipie was wonderful.  The chips don't really stay crunchy (which was good in my opinion).  We substituted tortilla chips for the taco shells, and topped it with salsa and a dollop of sour cream and it was so good!

My husband like this dish the kids and I were not too crazy about it I used tortilla shells in place of taco shells and I put dollops of sour cream in between layers.
