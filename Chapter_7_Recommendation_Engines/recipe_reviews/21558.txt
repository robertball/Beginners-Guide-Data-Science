WOW -- OK, when I first made this, I was NOT impressed (consistency was weird and I thought it needed eggs)... BUT a day later and reheated, it's TO DIE FOR.  I left out the capers because I don't like them, and added just a tad bit more milk to the blender to make the tofu mixture a bit more creamy.  Oh, and I didn't brown  the crust first... just thawed it from frozen.  And, I didn't steam the greens first.  I didn't understand this extra step anyway.  Just add to the onion/garlic mixture when called for.  ;)

I had recently purchased a 1 lb. bag of cleaned/chopped chard from Trader Joe's and then went searching for a good recipe.  So glad I found this one!  I made it last night and it's very good!  What makes it even better is knowing how nutritious it is.  I'm glad I read about the need for 2 pie shells because mine yielded exactly that.  I used all the chard and no spinach.  I also purchased the healthier pie shells...no trans fat and all natural ingredients.  I added a little more parmesan and cheddar and didn't add capers and cardamom.  I also added some sliced red peppers and sauteeed them with the onions and added can of drained/rinsed mushrooms.  Next time, I will incorporate most of the cheddar into the mixture and sprinkle less on top.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and is good served with a salad.  Thank you, Melissa!

I made mine with a wheatgerm spinach crust and it was great.  I think saying "you can't tell it's made with tofu" is an exaggeration, but not much of one.

I made this quiche last night and I must admit I was extremely disappointed by the results.  I followed the recipe fairly closely but I'm willing to give three stars instead of two as the benefit of a doubt.  The reviewer below who says the consistency is more like pumpkin pie is  on the right track; for me, it was more like vegetable dip, though.  

The biggest issue for me was the seasoning; I HIGHLY suggest using no more than the amount of curry the recipe calls for if you're not specifically using MILD curry, as I followed those suggestions and ended up with a quiche that smelled Indian.  I would just as soon eat a normal, egg-based quiche.

Also, you'll probably have to steam the spinach and chard separately because when uncooked they take up a MASSIVE amount of space.

Should not be called a quiche.  Interested substitutions, but it is completely different in taste and texture.  The spices also are a throw off.  For one, anyone who cooks Indian will not get the curry ingredients.  Curry is not one thing, but many, so that already alters the recipe.  And with the addition of the other spices which can already appear in curries it becomes confusing.

I thought it was a great recipe for trying out tofu, but will probably use eggs next time. I left out the capers and used regular mushrooms and everything was great! I will absolutely make this again. It is easy to add and remove ingredients and still have an excellent dish.

I left out the red chard b/c I couldn't find it in the grocery store... added extra spinach and mushrooms instead, along with 5 or 6 leaves of chopped fresh basil. Next time, would use a homemade crust and mix the cheese (used swiss instead of cheddar - personal preference)in instead of sprinkling it on top at the end. Still, very good, and as a new veggie, a great way to experiment with tofu.

I thought this recipe was delicious, but my husband said it tasted like a veggie filled pumpkin pie. The consistency was certainly closer to pumpkin pie than quiche. Next time I may try it with eggs instead of tofu and maybe omit the cinnamon and nutmeg for his sake, but for me it was yummy!

Loved it....but modified it before I even tried it.  I am not a 'shroom lover, so they got left out and used a red pepper instead. Additionally, when I couldn't find a pre-made crust without lard, I used the cresent rolls in a can and pre-baked them slightly before I put in the filling.  All in all, this recipe is really forgiving.

This was surprisingly good and oh so healthy!  I would totallly agree with other reviewers that said the tofu is not a good base.  I used have a tub of firm tofu and two eggs and it was still a bit runny.  Next time I think I will just do all eggs.  Be sure to use the chard stems - when chopped and added to this, it give some color (looks  like tomatoes) and adds a bit of crunch.

Excellent taste and texture. I followed the recipe as written, except instead of steaming I sauted the greens with everything else. I loved it fresh and reheated. Mine fit in one pie crust.

I have now made this recipe twice, with very good results both times.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is much better the second day - the texture improves, and the flavors meld and mellow very nicely.  I cut back on the cinnamon, nutmeg, and curry powder the second time around, and I prefer the milder flavor. It keeps well in the fridge for several days. I heat up a slice in my small oven for a quick, healthy, and tasty meal.

We had this for dinner tonight and it was delicious and very filling!  Everyone enjoyed it, including our kids (ages 8,5,3,1).  I did tweak the seasonings a little to our tastes by adding more curry powder and garlic, and I didn't have any milk so used yogurt thinned with water, but it still turned out excellent.  Will definitely make again and maybe use the filling for home made pocket sandwiches.

This was just okay.  A little soupier than a normal quiche might be.

Awesome!  I love this recipe and so does everyone I have made it for..even hearty meat eaters.  The only change I made was to add a 1/2 cup more parmesan.  Yummy!

i thought this was very nice.  i am trying to incorporate more soy into my diet, and this recipe is a keeper. i confess, i made it with a combo of tofu & egg (i was worried about the consistency, as some reviewers mentioned), and with a combination i thought it was very good! thanks for adding a completely different recipe to my repitoire!

Success!  My first tofu dish, and I didn't admit it until everyone was well into enjoying their supper.  I used my never fail Olive oil - Whole wheat crust, but will not pre-cook it next time. Next time, also, I will just chop the spinach and chard and cook down with the onions.  I added 2 eggs since tofu would not "blend" without more liquid.  Also left out the "sweet" spices and added our favourites, and about half the curry.

I made this recipe as it was written and it definately makes exactly 2 pies, which is great!  So healthy and tasty.  I recommend definately using the cardamom as it adds a special taste to the dish.

Wow- this is a really, really good basic recipe, which can be modified for what you have on hand.

I substituted whatever was in the garden- fresh thyme, basil, oregano, in place of curry powder- and also some sweet summer squash, thinly sliced tomatoes and bell peppers.  

Will play with this recipe a lot in the future.

Because of what a few others said about the seasonings I was worried it would not be good....was I wrong!  It is amazing!!!  The only change I had was I baked it in a 9x13 dish and changed out the oyster mushrooms for crimini mushrooms.  This is one of my new favorite recipes.  Thank you:)

This is a really good way to eat those healthy cooking greens that can be kinda bitter and unappealing all by themselves. It's tasty and the fact it makes two pies makes it worth the significant prep time (I froze the second one to eat later). I made whole wheat/oil&water crust which complemented it really well, and I used regular white mushrooms rather than expensive oyster mushrooms, and spices I had on hand (cumin, coriander, parsley, rosemary, cinnamon, nutmeg). This combination provided a very nice warm, mellow flavor. I don't think the texture is really like quiche made with eggs, but it's creamy and good. And I love that the recipe is so healthy, especially with a whole wheat crust.

Yummy!! this was a fantastic meal and leftovers. It was wonderful to see my 2 1/2 year old enjoy his leafy greens in this recipie. I used all red & green chard only as I had no spinach. Thanks for sharing.

Tastes really good. I am not a cook, but managed ok. Recipe makes 2 pies, not one, but it's good enough you'll want more! Good as leftovers too.

This is delicious!  I'm eating it for lunch at my desk. My variations: whole wheat pie crust, no chard (only because I had none), left out capers (because I forgot them)2% milk cheddar and increased spices. Thank you, Ms. Ayers!
