Good recipe but needs to be tweaked...Made this with scallops instead of prawns which shouldn't matter overall.  Thought the heat was good actually added more Thai peppers than the recipe called for, but not very saucy. Looks good but most of the ingredients were raw (lemongrass, lime leaves and thai peppers) which I think need to be cooked for more flavor. I sautéed the garlic and shallots which made it better.  Should sauté the lime leaves, thai peppers, paste to have more of a sauce.  Haven't worked with lemongrass much before either, but I think it needs to be cooked to be most effective.
Picture shows way more sauce than is actually there.

Needed the Sauce recipe only, and it is very good! I don't like extreme heat in a recipe, so I substituted 1/4 Cup mild chili powder for the dried red chilis & it was still very spicy but not tooo hot. Thanks so much!

Made with jumbo shrimp, the sauce, and put it on top of wild rice to feed a family of 5! Pretty sure i had 2lbs of jumbo prawns though. Yes the sauce is less liquid than in the picture but I kind of like it like that. I used 6 serrano peppers instead because my town doesn't have a lot of asian ingredients at the grocery store. I also sautéed the peppers and shallot with the garlic. Then i mixed in 2 tbsp of the chili paste and the lime. It was superb and my family loved it to bits! Just had to tweak the recipe a bit but otherwise delish.
