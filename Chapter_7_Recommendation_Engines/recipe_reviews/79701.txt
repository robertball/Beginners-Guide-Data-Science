FANTASTIC. This is a great simple fresh recipe. As per the usual comment, I added a very small red hot chilli(seeds removed) to the marinade and it gave it a fantastic taste without being to hot and overpowering.

Very tasty (if you LOVE garlic!) which we do. I only used 1/2 head garlic, it was about 12 cloves, and the whole pkg. of fresh dill just as called for (1 oz). I used fresh gound sea salt, and put some lemon juice and some sprinkles of brown sugar (about 1T. total) on the salmon first. Then I topped it with the dill-garlic paste, and let it sit at room temp about 1 hour. Baked @ 400* for 15-20 monutes. It was great. 
(I pitty the poor people I have to see tomorrow...garlic breath YIKES!!!)

This was absolutely terrific-I will definitely make it again.  I actually sealed ours in foil to marinate and cooked it that way in the oven.  Made it with the Dill Sauce from this site-terrific combination!

15 minutes was the perfect amount of time to bake this, but it was stuck to the pan!  But it tastes awesome if you are a garlic lover, which I am.  Probably should put some foil down next time... ;)  Didn't have any fresh dill, so I used dill weed; if you do this, you need to use more than you think otherwise you'll hardly taste it because the garlic will overpower it.  But YUM!

It was excellent. I used extra garlic because that's what my husband and I like. The salmon turned out great! I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This salmon turned out decent. I didn't have a food processor so I just mixed everything in a small bowl before rubbing it on. I'll be making this on days when I don't have much time to prepare food.

VERY strong garlic flavor.  I liked it, hubs felt it needed to be toned down a bit.  The fresh dill is very nice.  We hit it with a quarter lemon per serving after cooking which added a little more interest.  Very good basic recipe.

The salmon was pretty good.  My wife felt that the garlic was a bit overpowering.  It made the whole house smell like San Fransisco's Stinking Rose.  If you like garlic, you will like this recipe.  I added 5 minutes of cook time, I think this depending on the temperature of the salmon. But it yielded a nice flaky salmon.

This was delicious! I used dry dill and powdered garlic instead of fresh and kosher salt. :) 

Instead of mixing everything, I just rubbed the ingredients onto the salmon.

Goes great with a small spinach salad!

This was excellent.  I actually used it on flounder because that was the fish I had handy. Also had to use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic because I was out. I lined a 9X9 pan with aluminum foil, spread some of the oil/herb mixture in the bottom, placed the fish in the pan and then poured/brushed the rest of the oil/herb mixture on top. After refrigerating it for only 10 min I folded the foil around the fish pieces to create a packet and put this on the grill. It took maybe 5 minutes to cook and was delicious!

Super simple/Delicious.  My husband is a very picky eater & he loved this dish from the first bite.  15 - 17 minutes baking time is perfect.

I thought this was fabulous, but would love to find recipes directed towards working people who may not have the ability to marinate something for 2 hours prior to cooking. Did it anyway and it was worth the wait. Added a little Hollandaise as I was using it on the Asparagus, I had with the Salmon.  Delicious!

This is amazing!!  My first time making Salmon at home so I was nervous. I didn't use a food processer.  Minced fresh garlic and added fresh dill with olive oil.  I also grilled it outside instead of baking it. Great flavor!  I am glad I have leftovers for lunch today!

We grilled the salmon instead and it turned out great!  We'll make it regularly.  It was very tasty.  We didn't use the entire amount of garlic either.  We used about half a head instead.

Very good and easy. My salmon eating son and I loved it. I prefer a little sweet with salmon, but this is an excellent alternative since we try to eat salmon several times a week.

I have some addendums: 
I also make this on the grill. Off the heat. 
I usually cook until the thickest part is almost done, remove from heat, cover, and let stand until fully cooked. This makes the salmon moist and avoids overcooking. 
I serve with lemons.

I found the herbs to just be too much for me. The flavors weren't there. Maybe a fresh lemon would have helped.

This is such a winner. I thought I had bought enough fresh dill, but it weighted out less. That being said, I had enough paste to pretty much cover a big piece of Costco salmon. 
So easy to prep beforehand. I baked it for 17 minutes and it was perfect. Two of my guests squeezed a bit of lemon on it. We all loved it. Glad I have leftovers! Should be great cold, as well.

Very good and simple recipe especially when you've got fresh dill! As I didn't have time to let it sit for a couple of hours beforehand, I added some fresh squeezed lemon juice to the marinade just to add another dimension to this wonderful tasting dish!

This was excellent!! We had this tonight for dinner.  I used dried dill and had a lime on hand and added that to the garlic and olive oil mixture.  Hubby really liked it...definately making it again.  I didn't add a whole head of garlic, it would have been too much.  I used 4 cloves and I had a pound of salmon.  It was perfect.

This was very good! Dill and Salmon go wonderful together! We found the recipe last minute so I only marinated the Salmon for 20 minutes but it was still great! Thank you!

I wasn't able to let it sit for 2 hours, but other than that, cooked as directed and it was FABULOUS!!! This was my first time cooking seafood and I was thrilled that it turned out better than any I've eaten in restaurants. No more paying $18 a plate for salmon in a restaurant. I can make it better myself! Thank you, Syd!

I love fish but hate cooking it.  This was easy.   I don't have a food processor so I just finely chopped the dill.  I use wild salmon when I make this.  I omitted the salt; people can add salt at the table if they like.
This recipe is a real favorite.

This fish had a strong garlic taste, but it was good.  I added a little lemon juice to the mixture.  I didn't have fresh dill, so I used dill seed.  My husband liked it too.

This can be served with a 9dipping) sauce made from sour cream, dill and a few drops of lemon juice. It calms the fishyness of it.

This was Great! Used the recipe for a dinner made especially for my father in law and he loved it. Used a little lemon on the salmon before the rub. It was easy to follow and yummie! Took a little longer in the oven then 15min. Could be my oven? Served Crab cakes before and Asperagas/carrots with dill as a side!

this is pretty good. if you like garlic, it isnt over kill. i didnt have fresh dill so i used dried. i think i needed to use much more. i wasnt sure how much to put in. this was actually kind of bland, but with more dill it might have been better. will definately try again with more seasoning.

I love garlic, but this pushed it too far for me. My husband enjoyed it, and I also think it tasted sortof great, but I wondered what a more subtle version of it would be (this one seems designed for people who don't want to taste anything other than garlic). I'm going to hold on to the recipe, but put 1-2 cloves of garlic on each piece of fish, with maybe a tablespoon of dill. Then I'll see if it is quite as drowning in garlic flavor.

Great easy recipe - we did on the BBQ (on some foil).

Didn't have fresh dill, but great all the same!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I don't know why, but the garlic paste on top of the salmon was bitter.  I just drizzled olive oil into the processor and don't think I used that much.  I had to bake mine longer than stated because my salmon was thick.
