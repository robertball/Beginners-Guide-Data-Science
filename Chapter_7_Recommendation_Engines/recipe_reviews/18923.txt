As a former (somewhat rusty) bartender, I know what would remedy this recipe.  Sweet vermouth does not go well with vodka.  Maybe it was supposed to be dry vermouth.  Even with dry vermouth, I'd suggest greatly reducing the ratio or eliminating it altogether.  I just don't think either type of vermouth goes well with blue curacao but that might be my personal taste.  Also, you should garnish with a lemon twist and not olives.  Hope this helps!  Great looking drink as-is, though.

I have made this before.  LOVE IT!  I add a splash of lime cordial to it.  Looks very cool.  Good for people who don't like the rubbing alcohol taste of traditional martinis.

The teeny martini weekend is becoming a regular around here.  Each weekend we look for an interesting martini to mix up and serve in our miniature martini glasses.  It’s a great way to test a drink before making the big boy version.  When I first saw this it looked a bit strange; whoever heard of Blue Curacao mixed with olives?  So I figured I’d try it without the olives, keeping the rest of the recipe unchanged.  First, even for two mini martinis I needed to increase the amount of ingredients.  If you used a standard martini glass it would only fill it half way.  How did it taste? My wife couldn’t get past the first sip because she said it tasted like rubbing alcohol.  I, for one, prefer a Classic Martini but on occasion I can take one that’s sweet with a pleasant blend of flavors.  This had neither, and just tasted off.  Substituting pineapple juice for the vermouth might salvage it.

As vodka martinis go this one was pretty good. It's very pretty and tastes much like a regular vodka martini.

I love blue curacao; the color is so festive!  It is a strong drink but I enjoyed it.
