Ok Im rating this on what I think the original would have been. Maybe it would be a 5 Im not sure but we enjoyed our version so much we will keep doing it that way. Used a bag of french fries instead of potatos. Used spagetti sauce, grated cheddar and milk as the sauce. (Also used a little more sauce than the recipe called for.) Spicy pork sausage instead of hamburger along with chopped pepperoni. (Next time will heat pepperoni in the microwave on paper towels to get some of the grease out though.) Added chopped green pepper and red pepper flakes after the onion. The boyfriend loved it because it didn't have noodles, the french fries turned out great! Had a lasagna/pizza flavor that we loved. Will make it often. ***** this way

YUM!  We loved this so much that there were no leftovers.  As said, if you love pizza, you will love this.  (If you  are a no-grease fanatic, cut out the pepperoni- it wasn't really necessary- and use ground turkey instead of beef.)  Also, I would add mushrooms, black olives, green peppers (and anchovies, but I know those aren't popular.)

I was a litle unsure how this would turn out. I wasn't crazy about the sauce made w/the soups while I was heating it, but once it baked & the flavors mixed, it was great! I will make this again. I increased the baking time from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. The potatoes were too hard after 30 minutes.

This was a great, affordable and quick recipe. I subsituted hash browns and pizza sauce, and it was delicious! Also sprinkled with bacon bits and parmesan cheese as that is what we normally do to pizza. Excellent recipe that will be saved to my recipe box. Thank you for sharing!

Well this was a big hit with my soldier son and his buddies!! I was very apprehensive as it seemed it might be rather bland...NOT!! When all was said and done it was like a giant deep dish pizza...I modified two things. First I used hash brown patties as the base, they are thick and gave it a firmness like a crust would and second I added  about a cup of spagetti sauce to the original sauce and what pizza would be complete without red pepper flakes?? This is a fun recipe that you can add all sorts of "pizza" toppings to and create your own house speciality... One other thing, if you choose to use pepperoni and bacon, cook them by themselves and blot and drain well before adding!!! Otherwise you are in for some extra grease, but hey! Thats a pizza for you!!! Weekend comfort food or a football fave!!

I thought this was fantastic! I did everything except I used a bag of frozen hashbrowns and I added a lot more pizza toppings....I also increased the baking time to 90 minutes to ensure the potatoes are cooked....but everyone loves this!!

wow! my family LOVED this dish. my hubby, who usualy just "eats" the food i make, actually complimented me on this,lol. my kids had seconds. there wasnt enough left for us adults to have seconds. we will def make this again, but make more. we aren't really "big eaters" but we def need 2lbs of ground beef, more soup, more cheese, and just more of everything. if you double the recipe, you can bake one, serve it and eat, while the other is baking, then freeze whatever you dont eat. (we use it for leftovers)great recipe! loved it

Great dish! I used tsp of the sugar and oregano, omitted the pepperoni but added chopped green and red bell peppers and used tomato sauce instead of the soup.  Very good stuff!

Im rating this 2 stars because for one it didn't wow me at all for two, I left it in the oven covered for an hour and some of the potatoes still didn't get done. Plus, I think it could have done without the italian seasoning. Sorry, but I doubt I'll make this again.

I microwaved the potatoes while I cooked the ground beef and onions. This made the cook time much shorter. I also just used a garden spaghetti sauce instead. Overall, everyone liked this recipe.

Well, on the plus side, the recipe is well written and explained (bonus for spelling, too! :).  On the negative side (and I followed the recipe, as is), no one went back for seconds.  This wasn't a winner in my family.  They said it was "ok...and it was ok if I did NOT make it again."  I love one pot casseroles but I think it was a bit to bland/uninteresting for us.

I made this for a bunch of kids and there were no leftovers!  I didn't add extra salt and used turkey pepperoni--I don't think it would taste like pizza without pepperoni.  The sauce ingredients sounded strange, but it went well with potatoes.  I baked covered for an hour before removing foil and adding cheese.

Delicious!! We couldn't find the cheese soup so instead we bought a box of velveeta mac n cheese and used the cheese sauce pouch. We also doubled up the sauce cause we like it saucy. Also, we cooked for 20-25 mins uncovered after removing the foil to make sure the potatos were cooked.

My whole family loved this. It smelled amazing as it was cooking, too. I used frozen coin-cut potatoes on the bottom, and didn't have cream of cheddar soup, so used low-fat cream of mushroom. It was super delicious.

This was really good.  I made is vegetarian by using Boca crumbles and no pepperoni.  It had more of a lasagna feel than pizza.  Will make again.

good flavor, didnt use pepperoni.  Might next time.  Not a very good presentation but hubby liked it and he eats like a lil kid.  Might be quicker if potatoes were cut up before hand.

Easy pleasey casserole, especially if one has a food processor for slicing potatoes and grating the cheese. I followed the recipe as closely as possible, but I had to use ground turkey and turkey pepperoni because of family allergies to beef and pork. I also let it go for nearly an hour in the oven, because I wanted the potatoes to be super soft. It was easy to throw together, and turned out great for a week night meal. Next time I might add drained canned mushrooms and sliced olives; maybe also diced green chilis. These are canned staples I keep in my pantry, so why not? Pretty much anything one might put on a pizza is a go in this dish.

Turned out great on the grill.  Be patient.  Not too much heat 350-400 indirect.  I grilled mine in a tin.  I used low heat under the tin to keep the potatoes from burning.  I think I would mix all the ingredients before grilling to avoid possible burn of the potatoes.  You need to grill about an hour or even a little more to get the potatoes done.  I had the potatoes cut thin.  I used ground pork sausage instead of ground beef.  I used pizza sauce (Rocky’s) instead of tomato soup.  I added a few fennel seeds because I like them on pizza sausage.  I did forget the milk and it didn’t need it.  Will make this again..Great recipe!

This was good!  Not great, but a nice tasty change of pace.  Our 7 kiddos liked it and so did my husband.  Everyone said things like, "Not bad", "Pretty good", "I like it", "It's good but different."  I took the advice of other reviewers and microwaved the pepperoni a bit on paper towels to get the grease off before adding them to the casserole and cooked the casserole for 90 minutes instead of 45 (1 hour under foil/30 minutes to toast cheese.)  The potatoes were perfect and the cheese topping was slightly toasted just like pizza. My kids aren't yet into a whole lot of pizza toppings, other than pepperoni, but I can imagine adding other toppings would make this dish even tastier. I will definitely make this again.  Thank you!

I left out a step by adding the seasonings and soups to the groud beef. Just poured the ground beef mixture over the potatoes. I also left out the pepperoni and forgot to add the brown sugar. Overall this was quite tasty, though it didn't taste much like pizza. Probably because I skipped the pepperoni.

Very good for something different.  I cooked longer than called for to make sure potatoes were done and to crisp up the top a bit.

It was good for what it is. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was missing something. Plus, it was a bit soupy. I'm not sure why that was. Anyway, I'm thinking that you can use this as a base recipe and make it your own, using whatever toppings you enjoy.

I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef. It was delicious.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  The only tweaks I made were to use ground turkey & turkey pepperoni (what we had), and I was too lazy to peel the potatoes, so they had skins which weren't noticeable.  I left the onion out, as I don't like them.  I added 8 oz sliced mushrooms on top of the pepperoni along with some sliced black olives.  I found the baking time was spot on, though I made an effort to slice the potatoes quite thin.  I will be making this again, as it was simple, tasty & made enough to get at least 2 full meals for 2!

My BF was very unsure of this recipe when I first showed it to him, but that all changed after his first bite.  I made a couple changes to suit our tastes and what I had on hand.  I used a combination of turkey italian sausage and mushrooms instead of the ground beef, subbed a 14oz jar of roasted pizza sauce for the tomato soup, and left out the milk.  Covered and baked for 55 mins, then uncovered and topped with cheese and banana pepper rings and baked another 15 mins.  New family favorite at my house.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and two teenagers went nuts over this. This one is a keeper.  One small tip - I used hash brown potatoes and they cooked fine. I put a thin layer on the bottom of the pan. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome ... whole family loved! I didn't have the canned cheese so substituted Nacho Queso Dip.  Made it a bit more spicy ... also added crushed rep pepper flakes.

My 9 year old daughter and I both liked. My husband could not eat it. I had to make him something else. I think the potatos need to be browned before baking them. They were to mushy. Also this did not taste like pizza in any way. I don't think I will make again.

Great and easy recipe. My entire family gobbled it down and wanted more. It is also a versatile recipe. I didn't have onions or cheddar soup. So I left out onions-sprinkled dried onions on meat. And used cream of mushroom soup instead of cheddar-but shredded a bit of colby into the soups. Also didn't have pepperoni-glad I tried it anyway. Yummy.

This was a decent recipe.
Easy to follow.
The taste was good, but for those minding the waistline;
This is not an ideal meal.
I could feel my arteries clog with every bite.  :)

My family rated this about a 7 or 7.5.  I rated it a 6.  It's a rib-sticking and satisfying dish for a cold night, however, we felt that it was lacking in flavor.
