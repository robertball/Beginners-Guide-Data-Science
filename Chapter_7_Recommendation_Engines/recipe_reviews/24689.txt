WOW!!  This ice cream was out of this world!!

I made it using my ice cream maker and between the combination of whipped egg whites and aeration from the ice cream maker, it turned it to be quite light in texture.  If you like denser ice cream and will be using an ice cream maker, I would not recommend whipping the egg whites.  In fact, I suspect you could even leave the egg whites out, but try at your own risk.  

The flavor was excellent.  The honey taste was subtle and, if I made it again, I would probably use even a little more than the recipe calls for to give it a stronger honey taste.  The chocolate covered hazelnuts were excellent.  Of the 20 or so ice creams and sorbets that I've made, this is definitely my favorite.

This was nice.  The texture is fantastic - really light and delicious and with a quite pronounced honey flavour.  However you can really taste the raw egg in this recipe which I find a bit gross.  I'd like to tinker with it but wouldn't make it as is, again.

I didn't care for this at all! But everyone else in the house LOVED it. I have no idea why they did:) So thanks for the recipe I will have to make and don't like:)

I used Almonds instead of hazelnuts .
Purely because I did not have any Hazelnuts It worked very well This Ice Cream is wonderful. Any more like this up you sleeve Michelle.
