Green beans turned into mush with the long cooking time--a waste of perfectly good fresh beans.

I grew up on this recipe.  Love it!  We cook ours in a crock pot on low.  The idea is to get the sausage flavor into the green beans and the potatoes.  The extra time allows the potatoes to cook until they are soft.  I use canned green beans instead, and just use the water that is in the can do keep everything from drying up.  Onions are a great addition and cornbread is a must on the side.

Wasn't sure how to rate because I make this (with an onion added) in my pressure cooker. About 15 minutes once the pressure cooker is singing. I have even used canned green beans on a busy evening and tried different kinds of sausages. One of my husbands favorites!

Sounded delicious and southern, minus the extremely long cooking time.  I initially simmered the green beans for only 45 minutes (adding 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to the water), then added the smoked sausage and potatoes and simmered another 45 minutes.  Green beans were cooked, the potatoes were overcooked.  I can't imagine cooking this for 6 hours!! However, the smoked sausage flavor didn't transfer to the beans and potatoes, husband complained that the smoked sausage was "mushy", and even with the addition of red pepper flakes it didn't have much flavor.  Disappointed since I love southern cooking.  Maybe the addition of a little bacon grease to the water would help the flavor?

Okay. I make this all the time. But I figured I would put some tips on here. I cook my beans all day because we like them soft. If you want them firm only cook for about 4-5 hours. 

Cook the ingredient in chicken stock. Bouillon is okay, but stock from the box is much better. Also we've found that Eckrich sausage is our favorite.

This is one of my DH and DS favorite meals.  I made it on the stovetop rather than the crock-pot because of time restraints.  I did add an onion to the mix.

This recipe has the right idea, but I agree with many other reviewers when they say the cooking time is way too long.  I make this dish nearly the same on the stove in a large pot. I start with bacon though and cook that with some chopped onion.  When it is mostly cooked I add the rest, beans,potatoes,a splash of water and meat in the bacon grease(if the grease is excessive I will spoon a little out). I cook it with the lid on for only enough time to make the potatoes tender.  Usually my beans are perfect too and the bacon and sausage always adds flavor.  Great cheap, quick easy meal when done right! (you should not need to add salt because the bacon and sausage usually has enough!) Thanks to A. Smith for reminding me of this yummy affordable meal for my family!!

I wasn't expecting much from this recipes as it was fairly simple.  The only thing I added was onion because my family likes it.  I will say the first day I made it, no one ate any because it was pretty bland.  I reheated it in the oven the next night and invited company over hoping to get rid of it.  It was much much  better the next day.  I'm not sure that it's something I will just want to make again; but if I do, it will definitely be made ahead and used after sitting to absorb all the flavor.  The company really liked it.  I would like to say that we ate this as a side dish and not a mai course.

I made this because my husband grew up eating fresh green beans that were slow cooked all day. I personally don't care for mushy green beans. I followed the recipe exactly except for when the beans were done cooking, I had to leave the house for close to 3 hours. I just let it sit but was concerned. Got home, added the sausage & potatoes, cooked for 2 hours. Put in fridge overnight and warmed & served next day with Easter dinner.  Everyone who ate it said it was delicious and there was hardly any left! Easy to make, just a time factor. But making the day before made it easier & worked out great.

I love the idea of this recipe,except for the long cooking process. I cooked the beans till tender crisp and set aside. I like the potatoes to be a little bit more golden brown, so I started those first and then added the sausage to brown, return the beans to the skillet and heat through. I also made corn bread to go with this.

I grew up on a dish similar to this only we used smoked pork shoulders or cuts like that. Bacon fat was thrown in for good measure.A dish always full of flavor and very often used as Sunday dinner.

I didn't make this exactly as written but they way I made it I give it 4 stars. I didn't have hours to make this dish so instead I steam cooked my green beans separately. While they were steaming I started cooking my potatoes in a skillet with 1/2 an onion and 1 T. of butter. When my potatoes were almost done I added a green bell pepper, the green beans, and salt and pepper to taste. Served with some corn bread and the whole fam ate it up!!

I cut the recipe in half and steamed the green beans for 15 minutes while frying bacon strips. Then pan-fried diced potatoes in the grease before adding sliced smoked beef/pork sausage. Then added one enveylope of dried onion soup dissolved in a cup of water, adding a couple Tbls. A-1 sauce. I then tossed in the beans, crumbled bacon  and a can of diced tomatoes, simmering all ingredients for an hour. Topped with red pepper flakes. Delicious!

I have been making this recipe since I was married. I make it a little different though. I sauté onion in butter then add other ingredients (frozen green beans not fresh) and I add minced garlic, salt, pepper and water to just cover boil then simmer until potatoes are done.

5 stars IF you reduce the cooking time drastically. I can't imagine letting it cook as long as this recipe calls for. Just throw it all in a large pot with your favorite broth/stock and simmer until the vegs are as tender as you like them.

Being a Hoosier, this was a regular  crockpot meal, but cooking times are drastically different.  I always use fresh  beans, a quartered onion sliced thin, and a bit of  bacon grease. cook that on high for a few hours, then add sliced sausage and potatoes chunks and cook until  beans are tender. that's plenty of time to get the sausage flavor cooked in everything without turning it into mush.

I have made this recipe many times in my life time. I live in Indiana and also grew up eating this as a kid. It is a simple recipe with simple, but good flavors. I’ve always made in a crockpot on low for 6 to eight hours. If using canned beans, add in last couple of hours. I add onion, chicken stock, salt, pepper and garlic powder to season up a little more. As another reviewer said, it is much better the next day!

I used my crockpot and added new potatoes and smoked turkey sausage after first two and a half hours on high then dropped the temp to low for two more hours, and beans were perfect. I added chopped onion and garlic and seasoned heavily with homemade seasoning salt.  Outstanding comfort food on a cold day.

Been eating this my entire life - I don't think it's a "Southern" thing as I saw some one state - as I lived in Ohio almost my entire life and now Indiana, My grandmother always lived in Ohio and made it, my mother was born in W.Va but grew up in Ohio and also always made it - they both made it almost always with fresh green beans out of the garden. I don't I use a can of Cut Green beans juice and all We also add cut up onion (I use half a small onion) I've used both Red (new Potatoes) and regular russet Potatoes - no real difference other than red potatoes do seem to cook faster . We've always done it on the stove top in a pot, and cook it any where from 30 minutes to an hour , I have  always started with the meat, potatoes, and onions 1st then when the potatoes are almost done I toss in the can of green beans (again juice and all) Toss in some salt and pepper , and once done I use a slotted spoon (I don't want the water/liquid) put some in my bowl top with butter , and sour cream and devour :) It's what's on the stove right this minute :)

I did this in a crock pot for 8 hours. I drizzled the red potatoes with olive oil and put it on low heat; and added just green peppers and a sweet onion. When the potatoes got close to being done within 4 hours I added the sausage. We added cheese over the potatoes when it was all done.
