This is the best recipe ever.  We use it as a dip for shrimp.  Hot or cold, this is good.

I would not make this again.  The sauce was too tomato tasting.

Hot, hot, hot!!!  I followed the recipe, except for the "hot ketchup".  For this, I mixed regular ketchup with Frostbite hot sauce (http://www.cajohns.com/).  The flavors were outstanding!  I will make again, but eliminate the crushed red pepper.  It can be added to individual plates as desired.  I served this over rice with the Bacon-y Bok Choy from this site.  Yum!

I used the basics of this recipe as inspiration for a stir fry sauce.  It is very flexible and the heat can be adjusted.  I like the level of heat and the balance of flavors.  It's good with chicken, tofu, or shrimp.  Saute any veggies or meat that you like, add the sauce and serve over rice.  yum!

Once again I did not see the garnish suggestions until it was too late. This was good but I think it would make a better dipping sauce for the shrimp instead of smothering them in it after they are fried. Kinda defeats the purpose of getting the shrimp all nice and crispy just to sog them down in thick sauce. As written the shrimp is good and the sauce is good but I think it could benefit with a better execution. You decide...
