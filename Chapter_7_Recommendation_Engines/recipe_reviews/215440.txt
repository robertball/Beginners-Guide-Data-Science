This had good taste but was a little runnier than I like my potpies. My daughters aged 4 and 5 didn't care for it and 12yr old son thought it was just alright. May try again and tweak it a lil like use a lil less milk. Unfortunatly it's not like my grandma's potpie...but thanx.

This was very good.  Entire family loved it!  I made fresh base soup and used a bit of white wine as I didn't want the added sodium from the canned soup.  I added garlic, rosemary and thyme as well.  I also used fresh mushrooms and carrots and frozen peas.

I'm her husband and this was such a DELICIOUS surprise after coming home from a long, cold, wet day at work on the jobsite. better than the store bought pot pies. amazing for any wife to cook for her husband as a healthier alternative than zap fried frozen, sodium loaded foods.   recommended for anyman to take to the jobsite for lunch !! i could eat it three meals a day. cook it. eat it. love it !!! plus my woman can throw down in the kitchen.

This casserole was very good. My husband gave it a thumbs up as he helped himself to a second serving. I tasted as I was making the casserole and ended up adding poultry seasoning and a bit more pepper. I agree that using a half cup of milk will make it thicker and will do this next time.

I enjoyed this recipe. Used it as a base and followed the tips of others and only used 1/2 a cup of milk. I also used raw carrots, celery and shallots (because I had them on hand) as well as a clove of garlic when cooking the turkey. I also played with the spices including sage, thyme, oregano and cayenne pepper in addition to salt and pepper in the meat and topped the crescent rolls with oregano and thyme as well. Very tasty and very easy. Will definitely make this again. Yummy!

I like this recipe. I add some garlic and herb seasoning to it because it's a little bland. I don't put the whole onion in it and it's a little runny so you can decrease the milk if you like. My hubby thinks it's ok but it's good to me.
