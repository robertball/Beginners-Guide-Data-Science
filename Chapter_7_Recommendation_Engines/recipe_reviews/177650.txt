GREAT GREAT GREAT! The first time I made this I did it exactly as the recipe called for and it was wonderful however,  the next time I did play with it a little bit. Since I love banana daiquiris I added a pinch of nutmeg and a little splash of vanilla, and it just took it to the next level. I would caution not to let the banana mixture sit too long on the pastry before serving as it could get a little soggy so assemble and serve right away.

This was a hit tonight at dessert!!!  I did assemble mine slightly different.  First, 3 of my bananas were ripe & 3 were still slightly green, so I threw the green bananas in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes and then let them cool.  Once cooled I threw them into the KitchenAid mixer & beat them until smooth; then combined them into my sour cream mixture.  I opted to make 4 very fat individual circles from 1 puff pastry sheet & topped each with the sour cream/banana mixture.  I then sliced up only one of the ripe bananas and topped all 4 pastries with the slices (there were plenty of slices for each).  Finally, once I made the rum sauce I spooned it evenly into 4 seperate bowls, placed the pastries and then dusted the tops with more cinnamon (as I wanted that flavor punched up a bit). I let them sit in the microwave until dinner was finished (to keep them warm) & then they were devoured by everyone come dessert.  My only thought was that sometimes the flavor of rum was a bit strong in a few bites, so if you do not enjoy rum flavor I would probably cut back on it a little bit.  All in all, it was a success & everyone loved the presentation as well as the taste!  :)

This recipe was super easy! I did make a few adjustments, I didn't have any puff pastry so I used Pillsbury Recipe Creations Crescent dough and baked that, then added the banana mixture over that.  I also did not have any cool whip, so I used some heavy whipping cream, sugar and imitation rum and whipped that to go over top....this is a quick yummy dessert in a fix! It is on my fave list!

I made this just as the recipe says. It was a huge hit. When I make it again, I will use 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup. My bananas were really ripe, so they were quite sweet.   Definitely serve it right away. It gets soggy fast and is hard to serve.  I cut up the scraps of puff pastry into small pieces (about 1 - 2 inches) and baked them with the larger circle. We put the bananas on top of those without the sour cream sauce and served that separately for our lactose intolerant friends.

Great! I misread the recipe and dumped everything, but the sour cream, in a pan. It all boiled together, but still tasted amazing. Would make just the banana sauce as an ice cream topper too. Yum!

I did not have enough bananas, so I used the 4 that I had on hand. I think that 4 bananas was plenty. The brown sugar/sour cream topping made this really unique.
