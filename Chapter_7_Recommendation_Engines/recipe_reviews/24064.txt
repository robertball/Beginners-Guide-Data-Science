Really delicious!  I've been searching for a good sherbet recipe for a long time . . . Now I've found it!  I allowed the juice/zest mix to cool well and then strained the zest out before adding the cream and egg white.  Made it "melt-in-your-mouth."  Excellent!

Wonderful sherbet!  But next time, I will definitely strain out the zest. Picking bits of zest out was my only problem.  But wonderful wonderful flavor!

Excellent orange/cream taste!  I grated the zest finely as I wanted the smallest pieces possible.  I felt straining out the zest would lose flavor.  I found I needed to stir about every half hour for the first 2 hours to avoid separation.  The effort to make this is well worth the time.

Absolutely delicious!!  I made 2 batches to bring to a 4th of July BBQ.  Everyone raved about it.  I added a touch of food coloring to make it more orange, a little vanilla to the cream.   This will be made again and again

I never write reviews, but this recipe deserves taking the time. I served this at a dinner party and EVERYONE went crazy for it.  I strained out most of the zest, but next time I will leave more in as I like the sweet with contrasting sour.  I also cut down on the sugar a small amount.

It left a bitter, sharp and sour aftertaste. Nobody in the house liked it.
