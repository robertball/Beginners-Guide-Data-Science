These were delicious. We didn't want to have to wait for all of our tomatoes to ripen, and this was fantastic to use them up!!! They taste great.

To each their own but to me there was a distinct flavor that I didn't like; it left a long aftertaste. I wish other makers of this recipe great success because others have given it good reviews.

They taste very good,however the directions were not all they could be, it isn't mentioned what to do after soaking,  does one drain all the salt water off before soaking in water for an hour, also there was an excess of liqiud after cooking for 30 minutes.
I expected that there would be a thicker consistancy .

It doesn't say what to do with water after pouring over, or anything to with celery seed, or whether to drain salt and water after soaking all night. I had to guess, my husband says they taste fine. 2 stars

next time I do it, I would like to try not cooking the tomatoes at all.  I grew up with pickled tomatoes that were very crisp, almost crunchy, and cooking them for almost any length of time will soften them too much.  The blend of spices is pretty good, though I have to decrease the amount of sugar because I don't really like sweet pickles (cucumber or any other vegetable).  I'll be using this recipe again, but I'm finally putting my review here so that hopefully I'll remember next time to make it more to my personal tastes.

Just made them, or very close to them.  I ran out of green tomatoes, so filled in with cucumbers, and only had two onions, so didn't get a full yield. I don't think I would have cared for any more onion, anyway.  I soaked vegetables in two changes of cold water, rinsed gently with sprayer, then allowed to drain for about 30 minutes while I got the jars and so forth ready. I don't care for very much dry mustard, so reduced it to 1 tsp. I know they will have better flavor in a couple of weeks, but I went ahead and tasted them.  I think these are some of the best (what I classify as bread n butter) sweet pickles I have made or eaten.  (I have been gardening and canning for about 30 years, just to put perspective on it.)  Thanks for sharing this recipe, QUICKIEP.
