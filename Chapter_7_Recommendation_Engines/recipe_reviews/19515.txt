This one was soooo hard to rate. I'm giving if a five for creativity, but everything else only gets a three from me. The stuffing was bland until I doctored it up and the fish really needed some personality. I dredged them in a combo of parm cheese and seasonings before laying them on the puff pastry. To the stuffing, I added dijon mustard, worst. sauce, a bit of mayo, lots of seasonings and just a small handful of fresh breadcrumbs. When I say creativity, this is it. If you want to impress someone, go for it because you certainly will. Don't be intimidated by making your pastry into a fish. It was so much fun and it looked absolutely ADORABLE! My family cracked up when I brought it to the table. End result was so darn delicious and I do thank you L. Chambers for your submission. Without it, we wouldn't have had so much fun cutting up a fishy!!

Not only did this recipe taste wonderful, it made a great presentation.  I made it early in the day, and just popped it in the oven at dinner time.  It is definatly a "keeper"!!!

This was absolutely the BEST!!! Outstanding is all I can say about this delightful, flakey, fantastic flavoured dish! Only thing I added was some fresh lemon juice and parmesan cheese.  There was no sogginess whatsoever, the pastry was exceptional! and the fish(I used sole) was perfect!!  My husband despises fish, so I took the broccoli, cheese and rice filling from another recipe off the sole recipe from this site and even he said after the first bite that it was good! Unfortunately, then he tasted the sole a few bites later and stopped eating!! Oh well...more leftovers for me!!! Thanks for a terrific post! Will defintely make again and even use the filling in a stuffed chicken breast!

A very good and pretty dinner, although it takes some time in the preperation department, but it is well worth it in the end.  For company it will make them think that spent all day in the kitchen.

Excellent dish.  I didn't have crab for the stuffing so I used canned shrimp instead, added 2T of green onion, added 2T of butter and 1/4C. parmasean cheese to the stuffing.  It was delicious and my husband and 3y/o ate every bite!
I will make this again and again.  YUMMY!

I made this recipe with cobia instead of flounder, and added lemon juice and Old Bay seasoning to the stuffing and the fish.  I also left out the bradcrumbs and used less hot sauce so it would stick together- I tasted the mix before adding the breadcrumbs and couldn't bring myself to put them in!  I guess I changed a lot about it, but it was still fantastic, and I give (most of) the credit to L. Chambers!

This dish was absolute excellence! Never have I been so impressed. The only thing I did different was, I seasoned the fish with Emeril's Fish Rub,and used haddock because my fish guy was out of flounder. I used canned crab meat, and made sure I chopped the onions, shrimp and celery very fine (more minced than chopped). I may cut back on the hot sauce next time, but that is a matter of taste. My 6 year old had so much fun using the spoon to make scales, and adding the decorative touches. This recipe deserves to be featured in the next All Recipes Cookbook!!!!

This was so much fun to make!  I wish I could send all the photos we took... my husband made the pastry into a fish... beautiful.  The flavor was very mild.  It just needed lemon pepper, lemon juice, lemon zest and Parmesan cheese added to the stuffing...

Just okay.  Fillets needed seasoning and the stuffing overpowered the delicate fish. Lovely presentation however.

This is a keeper.  I didn't have the vermouth so I used white cooking wine instead.  And I used Basa filets because that was the only white fish I could find that wasn't super expensive.  I really liked everything about the dish and will be making it for my entire family (Grandma, Uncles, Cousins) very soon!  Awesome!

This was a good recipe. But I too found the stuffing a bit bland. I added 1/2 tsp dill, 1/4c parm cheese to the mix. I also both peppered and salted the fish. I didn't have flounder so I used small rainbow trouts that were boned. I filled the fish with the stuffing and then put garlic and herb philly on the top of the fish before the pastry. It tasted and looked lovely. I am not too big of a fan of vermouth and maybe next time would use a bit less. And I didn't use any hot sauce, I am not  a fan.

Pretty good recipe - It wasn't as hard to make as it sounds but I didn't try to make it look fancy since it was just for my husnand and me.  And I cut the recipe in half.  The fish could use some flavor but the stuffing is really good.  I used white cooking wine instead of the dry vermouth because my grocer did not carry it and I also used dry parsley instead of fresh.

Awesome!!!!!=) I didn't have puff pastry so I used Fillo sheets. It was for me and my husband so I didn't bother with the shaping of the dough. This was great paired with the Lemon Pepper Green Beans.

Excellent dish.  I've made in 4 or 5 times now and it's been a hit every time.  I haven't altered a thing because it's so good just the way it is.

I made this for our traditional German Christmas Eve dinner.  It was alot of fun, especially creating the "fish".  It was very tasty.  I converted the recipe to serve 10, but if I do it again, will stick with the smaller amounts.  It made alot of stuffing!  This may become a new tradition!

I loved the idea of this recipe however stuffed it with a crab cakes recipe and surrounded it with crab cakes. Stunning and delicious when you want to impress!
