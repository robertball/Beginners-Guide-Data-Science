This was a surprising win out of an experiment and we enjoyed it. We had never used leeks or farro and are still new to kale. I don't know how much a typical bunch of kale is but mine was huge so I used half of it. The only other changes were to use 15oz fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned, all broth(no sodium added) instead of water and broth, and reduce the pepper. I did need more liquid to finish the kale and ended up using a full quart. This made a very large 6 servings, and could probably be stretched to 8 in our family. The pepper is excessive for us. At six servings that would be 1/2 tsp per bowl and I know that would not be to our liking. The kale was cooked in less than 5 minutes and the rest of the vegetables were just right at that point. I'm not sure the zucchini would have survived another 25 minutes without turning to mush. Also, I don't have a blender but the immersion blender worked great on the beans.

I liked it very much, and with a few changes that suit my personal tastes, it will be a definite keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly except used collard greens instead of kale (no kale at grocery store).  Changes I will make next time:  I will add the squash later on, maybe even after the kale, since it got *very* soft.  I will likely add more garlic--I *always* add more garlic.  Finally, there was a bit too much tomato taste for me, I may leave out the tomato paste next time.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I made two substitutions (spinach for the kale, and barley for the farro), but other than that I followed the recipe. This is a hearty , and tasty soup that hit the spot on a cold winter day. Served this with a crusty french baguette. My husband and I both loved this, and I will be making it again!

As written, this is a good recipe, but I felt like it was lacking in flavor. I think the amount is thyme is a bit too much, as it was overpowering. I also added a little powdered garlic, dried basil, sea salt, and when eating, I added Louisiana hot sauce, which put the flavor over the top. I’d make this again, but would modify the seasonings somewhat.

Thank you so much for this recipe it was delicious! I had to make a few substitutions just to use what I had on hand. I subbed spinach for the kale and on the last cooking step I  cooked the spinach just until wilted, which was only a few minutes, so my zucchini wasn't over cooked. I think if it cooked an additional 20 minutes it would have been mush, though. I added some diced ham that I had left over in the fridge and I used beef broth. I also didn't measure the salt and pepper I just did it to taste. I think this my new favorite, my husband had three bowls. Thanks again.

Yummy!   Trying to eat more healthy and this certainly helps accomplish that.  I only used 1 can of beans , half of which I pureed.  There's only 2 of us so didn't want to make too much.      Added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice too.  Will make again.

Delicious!! Just added a bit extra of the  spices and added the squash with the kale so it didn’t disintegrate.

We had this the night and LOVED it.  I left out the squash and tomato paste and like tripled the amount of broth so that it would be more soup like.  It will be a go-to recipe in our house from now on!

This is delicious! I used my new instant pot so I deviated on the instructions to only use the pot. I sautéed the leeks, celery and onion in olive oil until lightly browned, then pressed in the fresh garlic for the last minute. Then added the puréed beans, carton of stock (instead of part water), farrow, fresh thyme stalks, seasonings and tomatoes. (Except the black pepper-we will adjust each bowl to taste) I used the rice/risotto setting for 20 min at high pressure. Open, add remaining veggies and cook on brown/saute uncovered until carrots are soft. (I omitted the tomato paste as someone suggested to avoid an over powering of the other flavors). I’m so glad I did. What a great recipe!

Used a lot of what I had in fridge- doubled garlic, substitute shaved fennel for leeks, substituted whole wheat  spaghetti (chopped) for faro, doubled tomato paste, doubled red pepper flakes and used a quart of chicken stock. Turned out great- fancy chicken noodle stew.

I give this 3 stars, only because the finished stew is SO peppery!  I can't taste anything but pepper.  I will try again, using a lot less pepper, and then re-rate. It's very colorful and easy; I hope this modification will make it a 5.

Excellent and really healthy.  But it took a lot longer to prepare than the time given but it was worth it.

Very good!  Lots of flavor.  Used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Added some cooked sausage that I need to use up.  Makes a ton  and freezes well.  Added to the soup rotation.

This was great! Didn't change a thing. Very flavorful and filling. I was trying to use up some veggies from my CSA box and this was a pleasant surprise. The kids loved it too.

Loved this recipe! I used green onions instead of leeks, eliminated the tomato paste, and tripled the stock, as I prefer a soup to a stew. Added italian spice blend and Bragg's liquid aminos for salt. Very happy with this recipe, and shared it with my friends.

A very healthy and hearty soup. I didn't use a blender to puree the beans- they are very easily mashed. This recipe has a little bit too much pepper for my taste, but we liked this and will make again.
