This punch was excellent! It smells and tastes great! Previous reviewer is right, though. I doubled the batch, and still ran out! Everyone just loved it! The Champagne adds the fizz, and it is delightful. On the second batch, I used slightly less of the mulled wine, and more of the champagne, because the spices are strong. Not to worry, though. We used up the leftover mulled wine with more champagne the next weekend! It seems to keep quite a while.

I sampled this before putting it on the Halloween menu and it is great!  I don't even like pineapple normally.

We made this without the ice ring (poor planning).  It was really troublesome getting the coffee filter to work as a strainer and in the end it took a really long time to prepare.  I don't think that I would make this one again.

Too sweet and savory for my taste. The combinations just didn't work.

This recipe was a great hit and I plan on using it again....next week in fact.  I will use only two tablespoons of the spice this time and I agree that the coffee filter does not work very well I just used a fine strainer and was careful not to let the spices pour out. I also added a small amount of cointreau to the saucepan with the apple juice and spices. The frozen fruit ring was great although I was hesitant about the three fruits...it was great! Make a double batch...better to have a little left over than to run out. I have given this recipe to at least a half dozen of my guests. I rate this a 5!
