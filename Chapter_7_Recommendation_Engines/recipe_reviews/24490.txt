A fabulous cosmopolitan martini!  A GREAT alternative to the traditional dry martini.  We used this recipe when entertaining and it was enjoyed by all.

Yuck!  Way too strong.  It tastes like pure vodka.  Too much vodka and not enough cranberry, lime and triplesec.

Now THAT'S a cosmo! I love a good strong not too sweet drink and this hit the mark. I used Grand Marnier - pricier but way tastier than the typical triple sec. I also used unsweetened cranberry juice-trying to cut back on sugar. Magnifique!

This was pretty good, the vodka was too overpowering for me though.
