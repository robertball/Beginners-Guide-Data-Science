This is delicious!  I do have a suggestion tho'.  Mine came out very soupy because I don't think I used as much cabbage as I should have.  I would suggest just putting a little dressing on at first and see if the texture is right for you.  You can always add to it if neccessary.

Used a bag prepared cabbage and carrots with the dressing part of the recipe cut in half (ie 1/2 cup mayo).  It came out just right mix of dressing to cabbage.

My husband has been making slaw for years and never measures. This recipe rivals his--it is the perfect balance of tangy & sweet. I used a 16 oz bag of pre-shredded slaw with carrots, and I halved the recipe, because we don't like our slaw dripping with sauce. Great recipe, straight into my keeper file!

This is an awesome an super quick recipe.  I am very picky about my slaw and prefer the slaw from Long John Silver's Restuarant.  This slaw taste just like their slaw, sweet and tangy.  I used pre-shredded cabbage and carrots, light mayo and splenda sugar. I also added a bit a black pepper because I like pepper in my slaw.  It was perfect after just putting it together and I am sure it will be even better tomorrow. THANKS!!!

Simply yummy, perfect measurements (though I totally cheated by using about 1/4 bag of cole slaw mix to the dressing so I didn't have to do all that chopping). I put this in a sandwich with sliced marinated grilled chicken on sourdough bread, my husband literally couldn't stop eating and loved the coleslaw all on its own as well. Definitely adding to the rotation, thanks so much for sharing!

This is a great homestyle coleslaw. Very creamy, mild flavor. This had a smooth mellow sweet taste. I only let it sit about thirty minutes before we ate it. I'll bet it'll be even better tomorrow. DH and I both liked this one. Great for picky eaters as there is no onion or green pepper. All I added was about 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/4 tsp ground black pepper. This was really fast and easy, a great recipe! Thanks Denise, this is a keeper.

An excellent creamy coleslaw recipe with zip.  I used store-brand "miracle-whip" style dressing instead of mayo and it was excellent.  Not the vinegary type of coleslaw.  Also, I used the pre-shredded coleslaw mixture from the store rather than grating my own vegetables.

Sweet, tangy and super easy.  It's just the right mix of ingredients so that it's not too vinegary or creamy.  I added about a tsp of celery salt for a little kick and it turned out nicely.  This will definitely be a staple in our house.

Simple and delicious! I used a pre-packaged bag of coleslaw mix and like others cut the amount of dressing half.  I used Hellman's light mayo and added a little celery salt to the mix.  I let it set for a couple of hours to le t the flavors blend together.  Perfect served with pork bbq - YUM!

I followed some other reviews and halved recipe for a bag of shredded cabbage/carrots. Ended up having to make a bit more dressing. All told I probably used 3/4 the amount of dressing. Also, added 1/2 tsp each celery seed, salt and fresh cracked pepper to dressing but it tasted delicious without.

I've tried several coleslaw recipes over the years and they all required tons of ingredients. I should have know that the simpler, the better! I will not go looking for a coleslaw again!

simple. That's how coleslaw should be. The ONLY change I make is adding a little sprinkle of celery salt. this recipe is a keeper. My fav way of eating it is on top of a BBQ beef or pulled pork sandwich!

I would use regular vinegar because the cider flavor is way too over powering. I would also add celery salt and an ample amount of pepper.

A nice basic recipe.  I jazzed mine up with the addition of chopped apples and real bacon bits (I got the idea from The Old Spagetti Factory restaurant).  Really nice and simple to make and flavorful and tangy to eat.  Thanks=:)

This is sooo good!  Tastes just like the coleslaw in my favorite lunch place!  Just what I would expect coleslaw to taste like, being a New Englander.

Perfect recipe, just what I was looking for! Nice and simple to go with the pork we have been smoking for the past 13 hours. We ate much pork and much coleslaw just now. Time for a nap, LOL.

I needed something simple and quick for a family dinner and this was perfect because not only was it very tasty, but it's made from pantry items you likely always have on hand. My only adjustment was that i added a tablespoon or so of dijon mustard to cut back on the sweetness and add a little zing. Also, I halved he recipe and just used bagged slaw mix, as I was in a time crunch.

Neither my teen daughter nor I are fans of coleslaw, but my husband and father are.  I made this recipie to go with Southern Yank Pulled Pork sandwiches I was serving them for dinner last night (recipe on this site).  It was FANTASTIC + super easy!  We all had seconds!  I even added it as a topping for the pork sandwich.  Oh my goodness!  Sooooo good!

I was looking for an easy & quick prep recipe since I had some left over cabbage set aside. I guess I didn't pay close enough attention to the part about this family favorite being from a Pennsylvania cook! This slaw tastes nothing like most southern coleslaw recipes that I'm more familiar with, but I was actually quite pleased with the flavor! My husband said it tastes like the KFC recipe and that's the only commercial slaw I prefer!    I loved the sweet/tangy flavor and gave it a 4 because I think its worth making a few times to figure out if yours is too soupy or watery the way others describe...I'm so used to the mayo-filled southern style salad, that the soupiness caught me a little by surprise.  I will make again though!

I enjoyed it! I think I got proportion of carrot to cabbage wrong, it's quite orange :) but still tasty. UPDATE: I think I got a handle on the right ratio. It's about 1:3, or 1:4 carrot to cabbage. So if you have 1 cup grated carrot, you'd need 3 or 4 cups grated cabbage. That turned out perfect for me.

I had no idea slaw dressing was so easy to make!!  Never again will I get store bought.  This was great!  The second time I made I use red wine vinegar, I liked it much better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Light and refreshing!  I used just a little less sugar than the recipe called for and added celery salt and black pepper.  My husband said it had a slight mayo taste so next time I might cut the mayo a little bit more.  I thought it was perfectly delicous, a great addition to any summer BBQ.

My daughter kept asking for coleslaw "like Grandma made" My Mom was no longer here. This recipe was what she was asking for. I use bag slaw futhur chop it in a food processor. I  use splenda instead of sugar, It is a big hit! so sorry about the one star (that was accidental) I would have given it 10 stars hI had the option!

Next time I will probably use a bag of coleslaw to save time on shredding.  I also added an apple, cracked black pepper and about a half teaspoon of caraway seeds.

I used this recipe for the first time making homemade coleslaw and I will never buy coleslaw dressing again! This was so easy and made just the right amount! (I used  family size bags of coleslaw and 1/2 this recipe! Turned out fantastic!)

We love this slaw and have been using this for a few years, people always love it. I agree that you want to add the sauce slowly to see how much you'd like since, depending on the amount of cabbage, it may be soupy.

Ok, I'm not a fan of coleslaw at all and always try it because I have always wanted to like it!  I have only had one I've ever liked and this is just like it. I don't like really creamy coleslaw and I always feel like they have a weird flavor, but this one is sooo good. I used red cabbage since that is all I had, and it's the perfect blend of tangy and sweet with the cabbage

I never made coleslaw before. Not sure why, just not something my family ever made at home. Well, now I'm the coleslaw queen. Husband was thrilled with it. We'll be eating this all summer.

Very good!  I did make a couple of changes.  I used reduced fat mayo with olive oil, and a little less sugar.  I took the advice of another reviewer and just put the right amount of dressing on, since we do not like it "drippping."  I would make it again.

This was really good. I used about 2/3 of vinegar called for and added 1/4 C plain yogurt, dash salt and dash black pepper. I think it was a tad too sweet as is (thats why 4 stars), so next time I will start with much less sugar and add to taste. I did add a handful of raisins (yum!). The dressing isnt too runny and even omiting the carrots wasnt a problem (didnt have any). A keeper!

A good basic recipe.  I use this for sloppy joes and barbecue sandwiches.  However, being from the south, I often make it a bit sweeter with 1/3 cup sugar.  Thanks.

This was fabulous! I made this for a fish fry we were having and everyone loved it. I even had to send leftovers home with people. The only thing I did different was double the recipe and add about a teaspoon of celery seed. Thank for a great recipe!

I am not the biggest fan of coleslaw but made this to put on pulled pork sandwiches.  I have to say it's the best coleslaw I've ever tried.  I didn't have any sugar so I used Splenda and it came out fine.  Nice and creamy.  I used one bag of shredded coleslaw (without the mix) and doubled the sauce.

I made this with precisely the proportions described. At first I set out to halve the dressing after reading some of the reviews but I had to up the amount back to the original or the Slaw would have been too dry. The only mod I applied was to add 1 shredded apple. The results were consumed quietly with the occasional murmurs of yum yum.

This slaw is awesome!  I put the cabbage and carrots through my food precessor and whipped up the dressing and had it in the fridge in less than ten minutes!  I did add 1/4 tsp of black pepper.  This would be great on chili dogs.

I've been looking for a deli-style coleslaw like the kind you can find back east. I made this today, and I don't think it was as tangy as other reviewers said it was. It gets better the longer it sits in the fridge. I also had a half tablespoon of celery seed. But I may continue with my search.

I have never made coleslaw before this.  I am glad I chose this recipe!!!
I had some left over cabbage from making piggies and didn't want to waste it.  I thought I would whip up some slaw for the hubby!  He said that it is the best he has ever had!!!!
Great recipe and so easy to make!

This is the same recipe that my mom has made for years.  It is tasty and delicious.  It does taste better the next day.  It gives the ingredients time to come together.  I usually make it the day before.

I love the dressing for this coleslaw, hence why I gave it four stars. I feel that it lacked a certain something, so I modified it to suit my tastes. I added about a quarter cup of diced onion, and a quarter cup of diced celery. This removed the two dimensional flavor of the original coleslaw and kicked it up a couple notches on the flavor scale.

It was okay as is listed. 

Once I added a few dashes of garlic powder, a sprinkle of pink sea salt and a dash of black pepper. It was wonderful. 

But I wouldnt make it again as it is listed. I also used light mayonnaise, as that is all I eat and it was wonderful

I made an asian variation substituting the cider vinegar for rice wine vinegar and added a little a water. Served with salt and fresh cracked pepper it was delicious.  I'm glad I read the reviews and halved the original recipe for the 16 oz bag of prepared slaw.

I found this dressing bland and boring. I added salt and extra vinegar to give it a boost and it still wasn't great. I'm sticking with my tried and true dressing from now on!

Great, I usually mix 1/4 less of the wet ingredients than the recipe calls for, add a tiny bit of finely sliced onion, about 1/2 tsp lemon juice and a sprinkling of celery seeds.  It is always better if it has been refrigerated a few hours before eating.  It is best on the second day.

Used one and a half 16 ounce bags (24 ounces total) prepared coleslaw mix. Added dashes of kosher salt, black pepper and celery salt. Made dressing as recipe reads.  I can't stop eating it, hope I still have enough for dinner.  Making with Slow Cooker Pulled Pork.  Very very good!

I'll admit i am fussy when it comes to coleslaw. I dont like it soupy and i dont like it too dry (meaning not enough sauce) Some can be too tangy and some can be too bland. This was the PERFECT blend of flavors in my opinion, it did get a little soupy over time hanging out in the fridge, but it was ok. I did use pre packaged slaw mix for ease, but the the only thing I did different with the recipe was add about a teaspoon of dill, I love the flavor or dill in coleslaw. Made this about 6 times already and couldn't be more please that I found this recipe. Thanks

This is a great, quick recipe.  I added some red cabbage for color, and then added the mayo/sugar/vinegar to taste/consistency.  And, left it in the fridge overnight.  But, this is all the recipe for cole slaw that anyone needs!

Yes, to add to everyone else, this IS the most delicious coleslaw recipe!  At first, it just seemed too simple to be good, but I read the other reviews and was convinced!  I have made this about 5 times.  The first three were as is.  I do agree, however, with others that the sugar is too much for my liking, so I do reduce that by about half.  Also, using white vinegar still produces a wonderful salad, but DO make it with the apple cider vinegar again when you have a chance because the subtle difference in flavor REALLY makes a difference to send this one over the edge!  Another wonderful variation is to use half green cabbage and half purple/red cabbage.  I love the colors of the red, white, and orange.  Very pretty, and the red cabbage has extra vitamins that are very wonderful!

Good basic coleslaw recipe. I prefer to use white wine vinegar and a tad less sugar. It's nice to add a pinch of celery seed and a drop of tabasco sauce as well.

Mmmmm!  Reminds me of Mom's!  Following recommendations from others, I cut the recipe in half (I don't like my slaw soupy).  I used 3/4 of a 16 oz bag of pre-shredded cole slaw, used light mayo, and added 1/4 t celery salt.  Perfect!

Good slaw....I did use a bag of slaw mix instead of cutting up cabbage...etc. I used Ideal sugar substitute instead of real sugar.  I also added some celery seed cause we like the flavor. Nice along side of some yummy pulled pork. Thanks!

I have made 2 times with Mayo, today I thought I would try Miricle Whip since I like that better.... The Mayo was a lot better.  I used half of everything like others said.  I did use pre-cut bag instead of chopping my own cabbage.

We make this all the time but sub Splenda for the sugar as we don't use sugar. You cannot tell the difference.  Make sure to refridgerate for an hour and it's actually better the next day!

Consistent slaw that can easily be tweaked to your liking. The better quality your apple cider vinegar, the better the slaw will taste. I typically use much less sugar than it calls for, but that's because my family likes a tangier slaw. It tastes wonderful made with the amount of sugar the recipe calls for as well.

Very good and easy! I got a small head of cabbage and carrots in my CSA so decided to try to make coleslaw for the first time. Very good. I eyeballed the sauce ingredients and added salt and pepper. It's great!

We really liked this! So simple and easy to make..I halved the dressing(I like my cole slaw a bit more dry) and used 1 bag of pre packaged cole slaw mix.

This is my new favorite coleslaw dressing!!  It was sooo good.  I made 1/2 the dressing and used a bag of coleslaw mix per another person's suggestion. I got lots of compliments on it at our cookout and it was still great when I polished off the tiny bit of leftovers a couple days later.

This is pretty good as is.  Everyone ate it and enjoyed it.  It can be improved with a couple tablespoons of sour cream, a little salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of celery seed.  This also tastes better if you make it about an hour before you serve it so that it can chill and the flavors can blend.  Good start to great coleslaw.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  My 9 year old said it was better than the cole slaw at a restaurant!  The only thing I changed was cutting the mayo, sugar, and cider vinegar in half and I did not have any issues with it being runny like some other reviewers stated.  Will be making again!!!

My sister-in-law went crazy over this coleslaw when I made it once and has tried to duplicate it many times. She follows the same recipe, but insists that mine is always better. I finally figured out that the reason her slaw isn't as flavorful is because she uses the prepackaged cabbage/carrot mix from the store, whereas I actually take the time to shred it all fresh. By the time I'm done making mine, the "sauce" is actually tinted orange from the juice of my finely shredded carrots. Hers is always pure white. I also believe that freshly cut cabbage is far more moist and flavorful than the packaged stuff. 

I admit that I had to read an online tutorial about how to properly shred cabbage (Google search: "Five Reasons to Shred Cabbage with a Knife, and How To Do It" to find the article I read) but it turned out to be quite easy and I've done it many times since. I've HAD to since everyone in the family keeps demanding I make it! I also like things extra tangy so I usually up the ACV to 1/3 cup, though I'm not positive it makes a noticeable difference.

An easy dish, and it has just the right amount of "tangy-ness!"  I used a 16 oz bag of pre-shredded cabbage + carrots, and based on others' reviews I reduced the amount of dressing to about 3/4 of the recipe amount, and this was pretty good.  I may use just a little bit less next time.

Thanks for the quick and easy coleslaw dressing.  I added paprika and dry mustard.  I also tried using stevia instead of the sugar - worked just fine but we all found there was an aftertaste from the sweetener.

Next time, I'll just use the sugar.

This was a good coleslaw.  I used a bagged coleslaw mix.  Used 1/2 a bag of coleslaw mix and 1/2 of the drsg and added some raisins and a sprinkle of black pepper.  Next time I will add a little less vinegar.

This super simple recipe makes a surprisingly tasty coleslaw. However, there was more liquid at the bottom than I expected. Regardless, I will never buy store bought again!

I've tried so many "fussy" coleslaw recipes to try and get fancy.  I keep coming back to this as I just can't beat it.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Update - I made this last night with pulled pork and added a touch of chili powder for some kick.  It was really good!

Totally cheated with the bagged coleslaw, but love the dressing! Changed the servings to feed 5, added a couple of extra teaspoons of mayo (the type made with olive oil) and a dash or so of paprika for a little kick.   Tasted perfect and not at all vinegar-y! Which surprised me because I didn't have cider vinegar and had to use white.

I've made this coleslaw for two very large parties and everyone raves about how delicious it is. I personally don't like coleslaw, but everyone else sure does! Very easy to prepare with the cuisinart! I didn't change a thing.

I think the only mistake I did was that I used the side of the grator with the smaller holes...I will use the next size up next time.  The flavour was awesome.  I just didn't like the texture..but that's my fault.

If you like cole slaw like granny used to make,this is it. I used sea salt and groud peppercorns-I added just a pinch of celery flakes which I mixed in with the dressing. This recipe is simple and simply spectacular.

Yum!  This is a great, traditional coleslaw recipe and super easy.  I put in slightly less sugar than the recipe called for and still felt like it was sweet so I will modify further next time.  Otherwise, very good!

So much better than the containter variety of cole slaw, and so easy to make!  I used one package of bagged slaw mix in leau of the cabbage/carrots, but kept everything else the same - just added a little fresh ground pepper.

Loved it.  I used about 1/2 of a large head of cabbage, with two carrots.  I would say I used about 2/3 of the sauce in this recipe.  Will make again and again.

Absolutely love this recipe.  It is so easy and so delicious - I did use red wine vinegar, because I was out of cider vinegar, but it didn't really make a difference, other than the pink tint!  We have already had this twice and will continue to use it.

I have been using this recipe for years after first finding it in a Quick Cooking magazine. Much easier to use two bags of prepackaged coleslaw mix to the dressing (or if you don't have a big family like I do, just halve the dressing and use one bag!). I always use Splenda when I make this and it's delish. I most recently prepared this when making the North Carolina pulled pork recipe from this site...piled it right on top of the pork sandwich...yummy! My husband never liked coleslaw until he tasted this and now he loves it!

To start with I left out all but a tablespoon of sugar. I like the tang of the vinegar and I really dislike overly sweet coleslaw. This was perfect for our tastes! Thank you.

Truly a great coleslaw recipe. I did halve the dressing mixture then let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving. After it set it was the best! Even my daughter who hates coleslaw ate and enjoyed it!

Thank you!  My husband loves cole slaw but is soooo picky about the type.  This is not too mayonnaisy or soupy, just the right amount of sweet and vinegar.  I bet I have made 10 different recipes for him and this was the first with thumbs up (and the easiest!!)  Thanks.

Very good, however one slight suggestion. Due to the amount of carrots in this recipe, be aware that your cole slaw will have an orange color to it. I decreased the amount of carrots the second time and didn't have this problem. Taste 5 stars, appearence, however, only 4 stars (with no alterations). Great recipe though and thanks for submitting it!

Very tasty and easy! I used Napa cabbage and it turned out well. I do recommend shredding the cabbage as the recipe calls for rather than grating, as I grated and it made it a bit soggy.

FANTASTIC! This coleslaw was delicious, fast and easy to make! I followed another reviewer - and used 1 bag of shredded cabbage/coleslaw, and half the mayo, sugar and apple cider vinegar. I also substituted light mayo for the mayo. I will be coming back to this recipe. UPDATE - I made this with purple cabbage and it was also delicious!!!!

Great coleslaw! I have been trying to perfect my recipe and for some reason the proportions were always off..too sweet, too sour..too many extra unneeded veggies. This is really the best coleslaw recipe because it's so simple and easy! I shredded my own cabbage since the pre-shredded bag in the grocery store was so overpriced I couldn't bring myself to buy it. I also used organic carrots which are way sweeter than the conventional kind. Try them! You'll want to eat carrots every day! Also, be sure to use Bragg's raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar. It has a wonderful cloudy appearance and the flavor is amazing. It takes salad dressings to a whole new level. Not like the other brands which are so processed, sharp and acidic. Also added some fresh ground pepper for a little bite. Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!

Yep, Yep! Just like Grandma's! My only suggestion would be to trade the cider vinegar for white vinegar. That's the only way I've ever made it (with the white) and I wouldn't change it for nothin'!

I have never liked coleslaw (in fact I used to tell people that I was allergic to it...), but I like cabbage so I keep trying to find a good coleslaw.  This is the one! I didn't measure anything because I was just making enough for me (no one else in the house likes cabbage). I used apple cider vinegar and honey instead of sugar. I can't wait to see how my in-laws like it - they only eat KFC's coleslaw, but I think this is better!

Really good slaw recipe. I used a big head of cabbage and did not have the problem of being soupy (maybe those bags of shredded cabbage don't have a full head in them)Used 1/3 cup splenda in place of sugar... perfect. My first choice in slaw is "Angies Dads Best Coleslaw" on this site but this comes in a close second and is a nice change from the other one. Very easy to make.

I used one bag of prepared broccoli slaw with carrots, 1 cup mayo, 2-3 tablespoons of sugar (not 1/3 cup - too sweet), 1/4 cup vinegar and added 1 tsp. black pepper.

Mine came out very soupy as well. It looked like the perfect amount of dressing until I opened the container the next day. It was also a little too sweet for my tast. Overall, this is a great base to start with and make minor adjustments to.

This was just the type of cole slaw I was looking for.  I added a bit of pepper.  Otherwise, I used the recipe as is.  I was afraid that it was going to be a little to sweet but after mixing with the cabbage and letting it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours it was perfect.  Be sure and add the dressing to the slaw only as needed.  I don't like my slaw "soupy" so I didn't end up using all of the dressing.

This is a super easy recipe that still tastes great!  I used a bag of coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots), which I chopped a little more in the food processor.  I added a little pepper and celery seed to the dressing, but followed the directions otherwise.  It was a delicious, no-fuss side dish for my son's birthday cookout.  Thanks!

A good, simple recipe.  I liked that it called for cider vinegar, because the white vinegar here in England is different to that at home and has a stronger taste.  I reduced the sugar to 1 tbsp & found that it tasted fine (I try to cut back on salt & sugar whenever possible).

I add pepper to mine and also use white vinegar instead of the cider.

Awesome and soooo easy!  I made a double batch in a hurry so I used my food processor, added a green pepper , a couple stalks celery, an onion and a broccoli top.  Also added a bit of black pepper and celery salt.  Result was to die for!!

LOVE THIS as does my hubby.  The cider vinegar makes it.  I also use the pre-bagged cabbage with carrot mix - so easy.  Also, I added 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and 1/4 garlic powder.  I was never a real coleslaw person but I make this about once a week.  Try it!

I don't know maybe it's just a preference thing, but this just tastes like vinegar and was way to wet.  I might suggest cutting the vinegar back to 1-2 tablespoons and maybe it'd be ok.

THANK YOU, MOM! Excellent. As some have said, I cut back on the mayo as I have mayo-guilt. I then used The Google Machine for the KFC recipe for their slaw and decided to add some fresh lemon, salt, and pepper. Next time, I might add some onions...and the 1/2c. mayo, 1/4 c. milk, 1/4 buttermilk like the old Colonels's. We'll see. Honestly though, this was easy to make and I enjoyed it a ton.

My husband and I loved this, but we thought it had too much of a 'mayonnaise-y' taste to it, so we added somewhere between 1/4-1/3 cup of milk.  We also added a dash more of vinegar just to suit our taste, but we LOVED this recipe.  The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the changes we made, but those were just due to our taste.

Easy and great tasting! I used what I considered to be a medium head of cabbage and a 10 ounce bag of shredded carrots and had to double the dressing in order to get adequate coverage. I do not like an extremely wet slaw, but I still needed more than what the recipe called for. I am quite sure that my cabbage and carrot amounts were more than the original recipe.

Solid, basic recipe. I started conservative on the dressing and didn't measure, but probably ended up with about the amount in the recipe and the slaw wasn't soggy at all. About a tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds do a lot for this recipe, along with maybe 1/8 teaspoon cayenne.

I love this recipe because it really, truly is as easy as it seems. No additional seasonings needed. Super flavorful, right balance of creamy with sour. Only comment is that I used a 10 oz bag of shredded cabbage to start and there was way too much dressing. Very soupy once the coleslaw wilted down. I then added to that a 16 oz bag of shredded coleslaw and that seemed to be the right proportion.

This recipe was amazing!  I substituted sour cream instead of mayo for health reasons (couldn't tell the difference)  I'm not big on onion which is in some recipes.  This was the perfect combo of ingredients!

Everyone said it's Colonel Sanders!   
If using bagged cabbage, use two regular size bags and be sure to add the carrots.  The small amt of carrots in the pre-packaged bags isn't enough.  This was really good.  It should be made the night before.
Yummy Slaw!!

This could not be simpler. Bag of cabbage and estimate the rest. If you prefer your slaw sweeter, add a little more sugar, same with the cider vinegar, but, be sure to use cider vinegar.  I used low fat Hellmans and blended with my electric stick, then let it sit for 15 minutes.  You can add any fresh veggie to customize.  Very creamy, simple and excellent.

I read so many wonderful reviews for ths recipe.  I thought it was a sure thing.  I tried maing it, both my husband and I were disappointed.  It was pretty plain  aybe its the red cabbage I sued but I doubt it.  Missing some zing to it.

Dressing is the perfect proportions. Just add cabbbage mixture to suit you. I added celery seeds because I like them!

I doubled the dressing as I like my coleslaw swimming in sauce:) But remember that the cabbage will 'shrink' as it sits in the dressing, so even though it doesn't look like enough, it is. We loved it and will make it again for sure.

I loved this recipe! I've bought and thrown away more coleslaw than I can explain, because we're very picky when it comes to the dressing. I also bought the 16 oz. bag of shredded cabbage and carrots, cut the dressing ingredients in half and then added a couple more spoonfuls of mayo (I actually always use salad dressing instead of traditional mayo) and a couple more teaspoonfuls of sugar. Creamy, delicious and SO easy!

Very good.  Loved it, so did my neighbor, so I gave her some, along with a copy of the recipe.  Makes a lot, would be great for a picnic or pot luck.  Will be making this again and again.

Very Tasty!! Mix in small batches if you're not sure how much dressing to use. Used a bag of pre-made cole slaw mix, added some xtra shredded carrots, red cabbage, and topped with some poppy seeds...Gonna try as a topping for Slow Cooked Corned Beef for sandwiches recipe ;)

modified recipe a bit.  Started by shredding a small head of cabbage and two carrots in my fod processer.  Reduced mayo (used miracle whip instead, because that's what I had) to 1/3 cup.  Used 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar.  And added a tablespoon each of cracked black pepper and celery salt.  Overall, simple and delicious.  A real keeper!  Goes great with North Carolina style pulled pork recipe on this site!

This recipe is so incredibly easy, and delicious!  I used 50/50 green & red cabbage for color.  Also substituted light mayo.  May try again with plain yogurt.  Goes great with "Slow Cooker Pulled Pork" simmered in rootbeer.  YUMMO!

Wonderful flavor.  I used a small head of cabbage and halved the dressing recipe, because I don't like my coleslaw to be too runny.  I left it in the fridge and ate it all week!

Reverse the amounts of sugar and vinegar and it might save this. Much too sweet for our taste! Better on the first day. I could not eat it at all on day 2.

I have my own recipe that my family just loves, but I only had half of what I needed so I went looking for a simple recipe, and found this one. And I didn't want to go to the store. This was a great basic recipe. If your looking for a good tasting normal coleslaw, this is your recipe. I did change some things on mine thou, just to kick it up a little..... I added all ingrediants like it called for...then I aded about a forth cup of Ranch with bacon dressing, about 2 or 3 extra splashes of vinegar, some cheyanne pepper ( to taste) salt and pepper ( to taste ) and a pinch of celery flakes, and some onion powder.  And make sure you leave it in the fridge for about an hour or so before serving.....Thanks Denise for a good recipe!

Thanks for the recipe. I lightened it by substituting light mayo and by using plain yogurt for 1/4 cup of the mayo. Also added some celery seed. Very good and simple.

I gave this a 4 due to me changing it a little. I only used 1/2 cup mayo, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 tablespoon of dill pickle juice. I also added 1/8 of a  teaspoon of black pepper and onion powder. Very good cole slaw!!!

This was a great start for slaw. I used half the recommended amount of mayonnaise and added salt and pepper and it came out perfectly! I've since made it for every bar-b-que we have/attend and it gets rave reviews every time.

This was SO GOOD! I only changed 1 thing.. I substituted Splenda for sugar because I had run out of sugar the night before. I just happened to have a giant bag of Splenda on hand. I also added a dash of salt and pepper to the dressing before adding to the cabbage and carrots. Thank you for sharing this! I'm so picky about coleslaw and I loved this recipe so much!

Amazing! I couldn't believe how good it was with so few ingredients.  I even bought the premade coleslaw mix at the grocery store.  SO yummy and so simple.  I did half the sugar and it was a very good call.  It would have been too sweet for my taste had I not.

This was hands down the best coleslaw I have made.  I only used a 1/2 of mayo and it was perfect!

I thought this was very good - especially beings I'm not a big cole slaw fan. I will definatly try the "healthy" version with half broccoli slaw next time. I wanted to use this on top of burgers or BBQ chicken sandwiches so I tried it out last night to see if we liked it before putting it on a sandwich and ruining the meal. I made it with "Mahogany Chicken Wings" & "Juicy Corn on the Cob" and the whole meal was a hit. Next time I will try it on the burgers since I now know its good! Thanks!!

I love KFC coleslaw. This recipe is better though. I used the same proportions and added some celery seed. I also added 2 tbs of very thinly sliced onion to one bag of prepackaged cole slaw.   Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I actually shredded the cabbage and carrots myself for once. This was amazing. I'm never buying that expensive slaw dressing in the store again. it's perfect the way it is! My boyfriend and I are getting really into DIY cooking, homemaking and saving money and this is totally a money saver that is delicious! The only change I made was that I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and I think it's wonderful!

so simple, so good! if you eat it fairly quickly after preparing it, it's a good dressing to veggie ratio. However, the next day it will be pretty wet! if you use a 12 oz bag of coleslaw mix and about 3/4 of the dressing like i did... next time i will try decreasing the sugar to 1/4 cup or less and adding the dressing a little at a time until the veggies are just barely covered. notwithstanding minor adjustments, still a wonderful recipe! thanks for sharing!

I love the simplicity of this coleslaw recipe!  As others have mentioned, I used 2 bags pre-shredded cabbage/carrots and kept the sauce measurements the same as you would for 1 bag, but used 1/2 cup Miracle Whip, 1/2 cup Real Mayo and I added a little buttermilk, salt, pepper to taste. Also slow cooked a couple of pork roasts in root beer and BBQ rub, shredded and added Famous Daves BBQ sauce with Tony Packo's sweet n hot pickles on the side and WOW was this meal awesome!

This was great.  I didn't feel the need to change a thing.  I used the broccoli slaw mix in the bag and added the dressing from this recipe.  So easy and so good.

This is a wonderful base to a great coleslaw.  Just a few suggestions though...add salt, pepper, celery seed, and cayenne pepper (to your own personal taste).  Works great on broccoli slaw too.  This is a definite must-have at our regular bbq's!

Fabulous!  This is exactly how I like my coleslaw - crunchy, sweet and tangy.  I made this for a family get together this weekend and it was a huge hit.  I did use pre-cut bagged coleslaw mix to simplify.  My only recommendation is to watch the amount of dressing you put on.  When I made this, it didn't look like enough.  But by morning, the cabbage soaked up the dressing and I had too much.

Very good, I used prepackaged coleslaw mix and all of the dressing and it was too much, ended up runny but tasted great! Will make again and watch the amount of dressing.

This is the best cole slaw I've ever had. I had to make two extra batches for my father; he eats it every night! Because my parents have some health issues, I subbed eight packets of Splenda for the sugar, and Hellman's light mayo for the regular mayo; there was no discernable change in the flavor.

Really good! I used a bag of coleslaw mix instead of a head of cabbage because I was in a hurry. We served this on BBQ pork sandwiches (using the crockpot BBQ pork recipe on this site) and everyone loved it!

I used a prepared bag of shredded cabbage and carrots. I followed the recipe exactly and used all of the sauce for one big bag of cabbage. It turned out great, however, I suggest making it the day before. Thanks for a great recipe. I will be making this again for sure.

Excellent slaw - I'll never buy bottled slaw dressing again! I added three items - 1tsp. celery seed + 1/2tsp. salt + 1/2tsp. pepper (balances and brings out the flavors) WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Best recipe out there.  I mixed in about a tablespoon of brown mustard to the mayo, added some red cabbage to make it more colorful and about 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed.  Try it.

This was really good right when I made it but after a few hours in the refrigerator it wasn't as good.  So my suggestion is to put the dressing on right before serving.

I probably should give this five stars to be fair, because I think it was my fault that it wasnt that great. I didn't use near enough sugar, plus Im not a huge mayo fan. I will use miricle whip next tie but thats a personal preference. I added lettuce too, again a person preference. Next time I will follow the recipe better because all in all it was a good one.

This recipe was very good and simple! I have a very hard time finding coleslaw that I actually like and I went back for seconds on this one. It has a smooth sweet and tangy flavor and  I love it.

This was a great recipe. Some people like a lot of dressing on their slaw and this recipe will make it very wet so you can hold back a little on the wet ingredients. It will be rather sweet with these mesurements so you can hold back a bit on the sugar too. I will add a little red or green onions next time along with some celery or celery seed.  But the taste is great and a memory of Grandma's slaw!!!!!

This was pretty good! I added in some finely chopped onion (maybe 1/4 cup), reduced the mayonnaise to 1/2 cup, added in 1/2 cup buttermilk, and used a mix of red wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar. My husband really liked it, and the flavors blended overnight so that the vinegar wasn't as sharp the next day. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe both in taste and simplicity of ingredients.  I can mix this recipe up in less than 10 minutes.  To save on calories I use Hellman's light mayo.

This was delicious!  I used a pre-shred package of coleslaw and added the sauce to this and it was great!  I did make a couple of changes.  I added some fresh ground black pepper and a half of a minced onion.  I also added a pinch of Kosher salt and about 2 teaspoons of lime juice.  It was perfect!  The longer you let it sit, the better it tastes.

This dressing is perfect! I cheated and used a bag of coleslaw though. I made my coleslaw in the morning the day that I served it. It was even better two days later though.

Very mild and bland and a bit sweet but my husband liked it - he is that kind of guy. I like a bit more tartness so would have to cut the sugar, increase the vinegar and maybe add some garlic and onion powder. Some celery seed would be good too. I'll keep this on file for the hubby but keep looking for one I like.

We LOVE this!!!!! It's sooooooo good!  I use reduced fat mayo and cut the wet ingredients in 1/2 because it's too saucy for us the way it's written (thus the 4 stars).  I've made this at least once a week for the past few weeks- it's good summer food and very Weight Watchers friendly!  I've got 3 lbs of coleslaw mix with the dressing of this recipe (as written) in the fridge now- I think that amount of veggies with the dressing will be the perfect ratio!  Thanks- easy, delicious and FAB!!

I made this ages ago, but I still remember how tasty it was! It's just the right mix of sweet and tangy! Mmm! Reminds me of the cole slaw at Red Lobster...

I made it for my fiance's family. They are british and their cole slaw is different. Oniony, no sweet/tangy flavor, just mayo. Yuck. Thanks to this recipe I have opened their eyes.

Add ground black pepper to give it even more zest.

To avoid soupyness, leave off dressing until ready to serve.  Also make only as much that is needed, although it is great the next day, after the sugar breaks down the mayo it will be soupy.

I love this recipe!  I have never made coleslaw before and didn't realize how easy it could be.  I have been adding the dressing a bit at a time until it tastes right, then save the rest for later or add more cabbage to use it up.
Thanks!

We used a bag of preshreded coleslaw mix making this even easier.  We used Splenda (3 packets – or 1T.) in place of sugar.  We also cut the mayo to 3/4c which was plenty.  Per the suggestion of other reviewers, we added 1tsp. of celery seed.  We made this in the morning & served w/ dinner.  Still very good the following day should there be left overs.

I love this recipe! Add 2 teaspoons of dill weed for the perfect blend of spices. The Apple Cider can be overwhelming, so add sparingly to your own taste. Definitely a keeper!!!

I am not a fan of two of the ingrediants, vinegar and sugar.  I made this for my husband as I had half a head of cabbage left over from a corn beef meal.  I tasted this and fell totally in love with this recipe, I must have ate three quarters of the bowl, forget about the rest of the meal, it is an excellent item

Good coleslaw. Reminds me of KFC....I used a 12oz bag of shredded coleslaw & it was a little runny, but still very good. Thx for sharing the recipe!

I can not tell you how many times I have made this recipe.  It has become a family tradition and so many people have asked me for the recipe.  It's great on it's own, but it's nice with a little celery salt and maybe an apple chopped into the slaw. I've also cheated and used store bought bagged slaw mix, but it isn't as good and fresh as doing it yourself. In a pinch it's whatever works:) If you are a coleslaw lover, you won't be disappointed!

Very simple, very flavorful. I made it a day in advance and couldn't stop snitching. I'm glad I tried this before all the more complicated recipes. I'm sticking with this one for ease and flavor!

Hands down my favorite.  Excellent, easy.  One reviewer said to add the dressing a little at a time. Great suggestion.  Heads of cabbage around here even when "small" are pretty large sometimes.
A keeper.

I use 2 bags of slaw mix with the whole recipe.  It's best if you add a little more slaw mix the next day to absorb some of the extra liquid.

seems a bit runny, but tastes perfect. I do add fresh pepper and poppy seeds if I have them around. Next time I'm going to adjust the ratio of the dressing ingredients so the slaw stays coated.

Good recipe. But it's best eaten next day vs. day off. After a day the cabbage softens up a bit to offer a softer texture. I also like to add celery seed to this.

I doubled the vinegar and sugar and brought it to a boil together then added about a teaspoon of dry mustard, 1 teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon fresh, finely ground black pepper....mixed it well to dissolve the sugar then dressed the cabbage mix to which I added a quarter of a Spanish onion shredded. I added 3/4 cup of mayonnaise. Absolutely the best coleslaw I've ever made. I like mine quite wet so that's why I added the extra ratio of vinegar/sugar.

This is exactly how I make coleslaw!  One thing I would add is to put just enough of the dressing on the cabbage to coat it lightly, stir and allow it to sit for a bit before adding more dressing if needed just before serving.  Nothing worse than watery coleslaw!

Super easy and super yummy!! I used a 1 pound bag of cabbage and followed the recipe except I did add a little celery salt as others recommended. It did turn out a little soupy. Next time I will use 1 1/2 pounds of cabbage and I think it will be PERFECT!! Quick, easy and delicious!!

This is the first time in my life I have ever made coleslaw.  My husband comes from a family of 10 kids.  His opinion was "this tastes just like mom's coleslaw."  Fitting for the name of this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half as there are just the two of us.  I asked him if it needed anything and he said maybe more people to eat it.  Well, by the time we got done eating, he had finished the whole container!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be making it a lot more.  Very easy.  Thanks Denise.

Awesome!  I used red wine vinegar because that's what I had.  I thought it was a bit too sweet so I added some more mayo to reduce the sweetness.  Would definitely do less sugar next time.  Also added the following spices - lemon pepper, dill, celery salt, black pepper.  Had this in a sandwich with leftover corned beef and it was great.  So easy too...will make this for my next barbecue.

Excellent.. I used package coleslaw.. recipe is enough for 2 x 1lb package of coleslaw.  Taste even better after it sits overnight.  Goes great with the easy slow cooker pulled pork recipe (using Diana's Gourmet western smokehouse BBQ sauce) here by Livie's Mamma

I used two pkg of coleslaw mix that I chopped again before adding the dressing.  This seems to make it "fresher".
The dressing is great; I added a bit of finely minced red onion and it improved the flavor.  I plan to use this when I make broccoli salad.

This coleslaw recipe is perfect. I used low calorie mayo (the 15cal/tbsp kind), and splenda instead of sugar. The taste was perfect, and only 33 calories per cup! So healthy! Made it several times. Not soupy at all, but I guess it depends on how big your cabbage is etc.

Finally I hit a home-run (coleslaw my husband would eat). I made coleslaw many different ways over the last 8 years, and my husband would take one bite and say it wasn't right. He just had a second helping and said "this taste good I'm having more".

I really liked this recipe.Very delicious.I used half of the 1/3 of a cup of cider vinegar,because i was looking at it and if i wouldve added all 1/3 cups it wouldve been soupy.Otherwise GREAT homemade recipe.The sugar makes it just the right kind of sweet.

Just right!  I made the sauce portion of this recipe to go over broccoli-slaw and it was perfect--easy and tasted just how I expect coleslaw to taste.

Oh this is so good! I used a 1 lb bag of Fresh Express Coleslaw mix, halved the dressing, and then just added what we like. 1/4 tsp celery seed and 1/4 cup diced pineapple. This was so easy and tasty. I only had it set about 30 min before we ate it. Thanks!

The dressing really is good.  I would have never known where to start but it has a great flavor with a little tang.  I made the dressing according to the recipe and set it aside, only adding the amount I desired for my slaw (I only used a half head, because I just needed a side item for dinner.)  I put the left over dressing in the freezer for next time!!! :)  Also, based on a slaw I've had at a pot luck, I added chopped jalepenos (from the jar) and feta cheese. Yummy!

My family really enjoyed this, although it was a little on the sweet side, so next time (& there will be a next time) I'll cut the sugar in 1/2 & add some granulated onion.

I tweaked this by reducing the mayo to 1/2 a cup and used a 1/2 cup of plain yogurt.  I have made this recipe at least 10 times.  It is a family favorite :)

This was a winner!  I used a bag of the pre-sliced cabbage and carrots and it worked pretty well (too much liquid).  Will definitely make again!

I agree with the suggestion to use 1/2 of this recipe for the 16oz. bagged prepared cabbage. I also added a pinch of black pepper along with some celery salt. Vaery tasty - thanks!

It turned out great. I did make some changes by adding 3 spoons of raisins and reduced the sugar. And also did not have regular vinegar on hand so just added apple cider vinegar.

Delicious, forgiving and FAST! I just used what I had in the kitchen - light mayo, light brown sugar and white wine vinegar - plus a store-bought coleslaw bag, and a ton of black pepper. Took five minutes. 

One note: I made the full dressing recipe (even with a pre-cut cabbage bag), then mixed in as much as I wanted - about 3/4. Give yourself a little leeway :)

So easy and so simple! Yes other coleslaws with lots of ingredients are delicious, but this simple coleslaw is also delicious. Great for when you don't have all those extra ingredients!!

This is a really good recipe to make in a pinch. I felt, however, that it was not flavorful enough. I added salt and pepper to taste as well as poppy seeds. Still a very excellent base recipe that I will use again.

Excellent standard recipe. I made a vegan version with low fat vegenaise (1cup).  Like most reviews suggested I used less sugar & mustard.  I would make again with mayo.

This is a good/easy recipe.  I used a 1lb bag shredded cabbage/carrot mix and added a Tbs. of Celery seed. Other than that I followed the recipe. I think I may try miracle whip in place of mayo next time and see how that tastes too.

So good and so easy. I also used the bagged coleslaw. I used two bags for this amount of dressing and it worked out perfectly. Tastes just  like the coleslaw from KFC, which is my favorite. I couldn't stop eating it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

PERFECT for a quick side dish, and a nice tangy flavor!!  Awesome homemade slaw, and not to mention cheap to make as well!

WOWEEE!  As others have mentioned, I used a preshredded cabbbage mix (cut me some slack, I'm 9 months pregnant and took the easy route), but stuck true to the recipe as written. So good!  Very refreshing and went perfectly with crockpot bbq pork sandwiches. Oh, yes.

I do not like coleslaw, but I buy coleslaw mix for other cabbage dishes. I had some left over coleslaw mix, and made this dressing (scaled to 2 servings) to mix in so that my husband could have coleslaw with dinner. He loved it! You know that a recipe is good when the person making it doesn't even like or try the dish, but the intended eater loves it. As a coleslaw hater, I give it 5 stars!

Tasty, but I normally use only half of the sauce and substitute a third of the mayo for turkish yoghurt.
Makes it healthier as well as even tasitier!

This is so quick and easy - and tastes WAY better than any coleslaw dressing you can buy in the store.  It's also a nice dressing for sliced cucumbers.

This coleslaw is excellent. The dressing tastes better than any store bought or restaurant slaw dressing I have ever had.  I will make this often.

loved recipe, just what I was looking for but made a couple of changes: used bagged cole slaw mix, miracle whip lite instead of mayo and added about a teaspoon of dill and 1/2 tsp black pepper to make it a little less sweet.

A little too sweet for my family's taste...will try it with maybe 1/3 cup of sugar next time. I did add quite a bit of salt to try to balance out the sweetness but it's still a tad too sweet.  Will try again...

I was desperate and out of the "jar poppy seed" dressing which I don't like but hubby does (don't get me going!) I found this recipe and the only thing I did was cut back on the sugar a bit and can I just say....YUMMY!  Hubby raved and I am now free from the evil jar dressing troll!  THANKS Denise for sharing this....I think next time I may try some dill in it just for kicks and giggles.   I printed this out and it goes into my forever recipe book I am building.

Best freakin coleslaw I've ever had.  I used purple cabbage from the garden and added about 1/2 small onion.  I used raw sugar, a little less than what was suggested.

this is a great basic coleslaw recipe, almost perfect for me though i half the ingredients for the sauce to decrease calories and even reduce the sugar more because i am very sensitive to sweetness in most things.  we can't stand miracle whip type products and think mayonnaise always the go to in these type of recipes, (this coming from a house hold that did and still serves MW).   i also add celery seeds and pepper.

I added some chipotle pepper sauce to give it a smokey and spicy taste.  It was really good but next time I make it I will definitely cut the mayo in half.

so easy. so simple. so delicious! the first time i made this coleslaw i made it exactly as written, and it's awesome. while i do love real mayo, i just made  a batch swapping the regular mayo for half light and half plain unsweetened yogurt. it's STILL delicious!

Used a mix of yogurt and mayo for this.  Also, we only used about half of a cabbage, which made a TON, the whole thing would have been ridiculous.  I added a little salt and grated onion and probably used less sugar than the recipe called for.  (Not exactly sure b/c I didn't measure anything)  Also, next time it would be better if I mixed dressing before adding to veggies.

We had a slaw off at my house on Sunday.  I made this one and my husband made "North Carolina" slaw.  The were both finished off and being totally different, they tasted the same to me.  The girls went with mine and the the boys went with their Dad's.  Figures!

I just made this with purple cabbage. I shredded/chopped the cabbage and added diced carrots. I also added a couple tablespoons white onion. I added fresh ground pepper to the mayonnaisse/vinegar mixture and used a little less sugar and vinegar than called for. This is delicious!

This really is such a simple, yet delicious recipes for coleslaw.  I did add some some celery seeds and halved the amount of dressing mixture. I also bought a bag of coleslaw mix which made it even easier to put together.  This will definitely be one that we repeat.

Good and simple I added red bell pepper and parsley for color. I served this for a party along with grilled beef tenderloin sandwiches, scalloped potatoes, pasta salad, and sauteed zukes and corn. Update: made this again. This time I added celery seed and red cabbage. A good base creamy slaw recipe

This is a quick and easy base recipe.  To make a more low-fat version, I substituted half the mayonnaise with plain, fat-free yogurt, and reduced the cider vinegar by half.  I also added salt and pepper and a little dill weed for some extra flavor.  Delish!

Not much of a Cole Slaw person, but like another member.. Long Johns Silvers is my favorite (USED TO BE MY FAVORITE) Mine is my favorite now.. haha.  Your "MOM" must be one heck of a cook!  Just made another batch.. 3rd time this month.  I like the creamy texture.   Wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.

I made this coleslaw for a potluck lunch at work and it turned out very well.  I followed the recipe as written, but I also added 1/2 cup of raisins, which is the way coleslaw is usually made here in the Virgin Islands.  It was enjoyed by all.

Made this in a purple version to take tailgating.  It was a big hit.  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and it worked great.  Will definately make this again.

This was okay.  After all the rave reviews, I was expecting better.  Flavor seemed to be lacking.  Someone mentioned adding celery seed--that probably would help.  Or "salad dressing" instead of mayo.

This is a nice bacic coleslaw. When I made it I purchased the presliced coleslaw mix in the salad section and then just added it to the dressing after mixing it with a wisk to get it nice and smoothe.  I'll be using this recipe for years to come.  Thanks Denise

I like sweet coleslaw and this hit the spot. I used a small head of cabbage from the garden, freshly dug up baby carrots, and about 2 T of vinegar. Served with "Cheddar Bacon Hamburgers," "Old Fashioned Onion Rings," "Belles Hamburger Buns," and "Pineapple Carrot Salad."

MMMMM...good!  I had to make this twice to get the sugar/vinegar ratio right, but once I did it really tastes great.  My wife said it tastes like KFC.  Tastes even better the next day.  Oh, and just a dash of celery seed for that extra kick.

Perfect.  I like my coleslaw simple: sweet and tangy.  I'm not a fan of any extra flavors.  This is super good and will be my go-to recipe for coleslaw.  Yummy!

Love this recipe! Easy, simple, and compared to the cost to purchase some in the deli, way affordable! It only costs about $4/5 to make for a huge batch.  Good thing to take to a BBQ or party when you are on a budget.  If you have a food processor to do the chopping for you, you have it made.  Quick, inexpensive, and great tasting-just what I like.  Thanks

Great recipe! I think there are better tasting coleslaws out there, but none that even compare to how easy this recipe is. I do add a bit of salt, pepper & onion, otherwise perfect as is.

This was the easiest recipe!  I followed another reviewer's tip to reduce the amount of mayo to 1/2 cup and it was the perfect amount for the bagged coleslaw mix.  Not too watery at all.  Loved the recipe! Will be making again!

This coleslaw is really good! My husband gave it a 4 1/2 out of 5. Both of my children (11 yrs old) gobbled it up and they are usually picky. We used prepackaged coleslaw mix. (The whole bag) and followed the same measurements on the sugar, mayo, and vinegar.. We used apple cider vinegar instead of plain cider vinegar.

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe!  The first time I made it I tried it immediately after making it... that was a very bad idea.  It needs to sit in the fridge for at least a few hours before tasting or else it just tastes like vinegar.  Everytime I make it I have to make extra because I know I will have to give some away to friends (they beg for it!).  I always make the recipe exactly as written. I like my coleslaw soupy so that has never been an issue for me. Delicious!!

Really good, I used Red Wine vinegar no cider.  Made for a pot luck and people could not believe that I made homemade coleslaw, use red and green cabbage for great color.  Make sure to mix the dressing and salad part right before you serve tastes better this way and won't get soupy.

I'm on board with the five star group. I have an incredible abundance of red cabbage in my garden this year and this is a quick and easy recipe that makes it disappear at amazing speeds. Would like to try it with jicama and/or celery seeds as I've seen in other recipes, but haven't any on hand - this is fantastic the way it is, however.

This was incredible. I was searching for a simple, yet tasty and right portion amount of tangy to sweet flavour and this held it all. You can make this the day before and it holds great for a few days too.

Excellent recipe.  I used splenda and Kraft fat free mayo as we are trying to lose weight.  It was great.  My grandma always added celery seed (not celery salt)to her cole slaw so added some to this one and it tasted just like hers.  It's a keeper.  I also made the pulled pork recipe from this website (the one with the root beer) and served them together for a real old fashioned southern BBQ.  Even though I'm in upstate NY.

Excellent! I also used bagged pre-shredded vegetables. The coleslaw came out just the way you get it in deli's. There is a lot of dressing once the salad sits for a while, but that's also how it is when you buy it. Definitely keeping this one!

Great, easy recipe. My children loved it! I agree with the comments about making it before needed (at least 2-3 hours). I think next time I may put a little less of the vinegar (3 Tb).

This turned out great.  I used 1 bag 10 oz of shredded cabbage with carrots and one 10 oz bag of shredded carrots as my hubby prefers carrots over cabbage.  I made the dressing as stated and let this sit over night in the fridge.  I did add a bit of salt and fresh cracked pepper.  We served this with Pulled pork to rave reviews.  I will definitely make this again.

I have never made coleslaw before and this was very easy. My hubby is picky about coleslaws and he said this is the best he has ever eaten. I have made it several times now and even have family asking me for the recipe. I wouldnt change a thing on this recipe

I used a large head of cabbage and 6 carrots. I grated everything in the food processer and it made a lot! I used the measurements for the dressing as written and it came out DELICIOUS! I can see how it could be soupy waith a small head of cabbage and 3 carrots, just add the dressing a little at a time until it's the way you like it. My hasband added 3 tablespoons of sweet pickle relish, and he says its as good as his Mom's. Definitely a keeper, thanks!!

I liked it alot,maybe abit sweet, but that suits me just fine. It was made to accompany wings and pulled pork sandwiches. I think the combo worked well for our party.

I love this recipe! Thank you so much for it. I like to play with recipes to fit my own family's tastes. So I added 1/2 tbs celery seed. And to make things simpler, I used 2 bags (14 oz) pre-shreaded slaw. So simple and yummy! Thanks again!

Best coleslaw recipe I've made so far.  I made it last weekend by using a bag of ready chopped cabbage and carrots so I cut the dressing in half and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. It was delicious and plan to make it again this weekend.

I have to say I was surprised this was as good as it was. I am taking tomorrow night to a jewelry party so I hope the cabbage wilts a bit. Very tasty so far. I used a big head and doubled the mayo mix. Also used apple cider vinegar as thats all I had. Deeeelish. Thanks so much

Delicious and so easy!  The only thing I added was some black pepper.  Like other reviewers, I think the whole recipe for one small head of cabbage might be too much - I made half the recipe and used it with a big bag of coleslaw mix and it was the perfect amount. Who would have thought three ingredient coleslaw dressing would have better flavor than some with 10+??

This is a great recipe.  I used a bag of broccoli slaw (sneaking in that fiber) and added crasins which I use in all of my cold salads.  Awesome!  My 5 year old is typically picky but she asked for more!

Very yummy, easy to make. I did add raisins to our coleslaw. I will add pineapple when my mom visits to make it taste just like when I was a kid.

This recipe was excellent! My whole family loved it so much. The only suggestion I have is to make sure to cut down on the sugar,vinegar and mayo! 1/2 is more then enough...

This was very good, basic coleslaw.  I used a pre shredded coleslaw mix and scaled the ingredients accordingly.  My husband loves a creamy slaw and he really enjoyed it.  Very easy.

This was ok. I should have cut the coleslaw thinner and there should be less carrots than called for in the recipe. I think the dressing is pretty good, but toying with the dressing to vegetable recipe might make it better. Would try it again in the future.

I made this recipe with a 16 oz bag of premade coleslaw and used the sauce for 10 servings and it was just right for my husband and me!!!   WE LOVE THIS COLESLAW!  My 5 yr old only eats the slaw at Long John Silvers, but this definately passed the test!! THANKS!

This was very good, but I agree if you are not going to serve right away, the coleslaw gets soupy.  So next time I will cut the dressing in half.  Also at my husband's request I added some raisins. I will definetely make this again!

This is a great quick recipe for coleslaw!  My family loves it!  The only thing that I did differently is I added celery seed and I did not use carrots (just because I did not have them).  It turned out amazing!

Tasted great, only downfall is dressing got a little soupy. I was torn between making it right before hand, or letting it all "stew"...making it right before hand would've been the way to go!

It was really good, but I think lacking some spice.  I added some ground black pepper (a LOT) and celery salt, along with a little dash of paprika on top.  It made it taste much better.  Overall, great base recipe to tweak just how you like it.  Thanks!

I followed directions, but this was way too much mayo and vinegar for us! I will try it again with less of each.

Excellant, but we decreased sugar to 1/4 cup and added a little red onion.

Excellent recipe, quick and easy!  I added just a little brown mustard.  Best Coleslaw ever, I will never buy pre-made or bagged slaw again.  Thanks.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is really good. It really tastes like KFC. I even used half plain yogurt to mix in with half the mayo that it calls for in this recipe. Kids loved it and I'll make this alot this summer

this was my first time making cole slaw and it was easy to make and yummy!  i added a half cup of raisins and some pepper as well.  also....when i made it, it didn't seem like i had enough dressing (i prefer mine a bit more liquidy), so i added a tiny bit more mayo, sugar and vinegar.  mistake!  i didn't realize that it would take a bit for it to get a bit more liquidy as it sat.  next time, i'll let it sit longer.  

anyway.  yummy!  i will totally make this again.  : )

my family enjoyed this. I added pepper, salt, and cumin for added flavor. I shortend the amount of sugar just enough to even out the cider.

I have used this recipe twice and made sure I printed it out, although it is super easy to remember.  Easy and tasty, what more could you ask for.

good recipe but needed some pepper and celery seed. It was a bit runny but had a good flavor.
