I loved this recipe, very similar to mine. I dry age my beef for a week prior to the dinner. I let my roast sit out @ room temp for  2 1/2 to 4 hours before cooking. I like a higher heat,  I preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

 Put the room temperature roast in the preheated oven (@500 degrees) and roast 15 minutes for EACH rib. Six rib roast = 1.5 hours @ 500 degrees.

When cooking time is finished, turn off the oven. "Do not open the door at any time". 
Allow the roast to remain in the oven until oven is lukewarm, (about two hours). 
The roast will still have a crunchy brown crust and will be cooked to a perfect medium rare.

I did like another reviewer...  I let my roast sit out @ room temp for 2-1/2 to 4 hours before cooking. I PREHEAT the OVEN to 500*F. Put the room temperature roast in the preheated oven (@500*F) & roast 15 minutes for EACH rib. Six rib roast = 1.5 hours @ 500 degrees. When cooking time is finished, turn off the oven. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR! Allow the roast to remain in the oven until oven is lukewarm, (@2 hours). The roast will still have a crunchy brown crust & will be cooked to a perfect medium rare.

I tried this recipe with a 9 pound bone in rib roast and  wow it was amazing..... The cook time was a little off because at 2 hours it was at  135 internal temp and really it should have been pulled out at about 120 so it would of ended up about 130 to 135. Very tasty.

This Prime Rib was ''FANTASTIC''....Served this on Christmas Eve.. I had a 4# Roast, rubbed the ''crust'' on well.... Cooked it at 450 degrees for 30 min., then 325 degrees for another 90 min., let it sit for 45 min before slicing... it was ''Med-Rare'' and my dinner guests loved it...This is a ''KEEPER''... Will use it from now on!!

I made this today and thought to myself...kind of crazy for me to try a new recipe on Christmas day.....but took a shot at it.   I bought a 5.30 pound prime rib roast at Costco.  $16.89 a pound....worth every penny. It was literally a "Prime" beef -- top shelf for Costco standard.   Recipe is very easy to follow.  I didnt have any garlic powder and just added a little minced garlic in its place.  Everyone loved dinner.  It was as good as any 5 star restaurant.   Amazing taste!   I couldn't be happier.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. I cooked a 14 lb prime rib and baked it 3 hours. I turned it down to 325 instead of 350  degrees after the initial 30 minutes at 450 degrees. My family loved it!

Oh, my goodness!  I used this recipe for Thanksgiving instead if a turkey.  Best decision I ever made!  It was so amazingly delicious, I couldn't believe I actually cooked it.  This is a fabulous recipe and I will definitely use it again.

Perfect recipe!! I decided to do a Prime Rib Roast for Thanksgiving this year. I have tried a few different recipes over the years for smaller roasts. This year we needed a 16 pound roast (7 Rib) so I decide to find a new recipe. I tripled the ingrediant count from this recipe and it turned out perfect. The one thing I did learn from cooking a large roast was the fact the I waited until the internal temp was 130' and the center cut was all that came out medium rare. Next time, I'll remove the roast when the internal temp reaches 120'.

I made this recipe last year and FINALLY felt like I had conquered the Prime Rib!  It was easy and delicious!  I'm making it again tomorrow, my husband considers himself a "prime rib conniseur" and he raves about it.

This was my first time to make this roast.  I had high hopes, as I love all the ingredients involved.  I prepared and cooked it EXACTLY as written/shown.  (Nothing frustrates me more than a review that is 50% edited from another recipe.)  That said, prepared as described, flavor is 6/10 finished product is 5/10.  Previous reviewers who mentioned cooking it at 500 for first 30 mins, then 325 for remaining minutes are exactly correct.  I went by the directions and pulled out my roast when thermometer read 55*C (rare, according to recipe.)  The roast was medium-medium well.  There is a chance my thermometer is wrong, but not my reading of it.  Might use the rub part again, never the roasting instructions.  Good meat gone...meh.

I have never made a rib roast before so I wanted to try it out before Christmas so  made a small one with two ribs in it. I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it was not just great but AMAZING. It's so easy and I cut the ribs off the meat  on my own after it rested a half hour. That was easy to do also you can look on u tube to see how to cut the ribs out. If you don't want to do that just ask the butcher to trim and tie it for you this way you don't need to worry.  This will be my go to recipe for Christmas or when I'm having company. Try it you'll be pleased.

Yup. I bought the French's horseradish mustard and added big sprigs of fresh rosemary to mine. As you can see by the picture it turned out perfectly.

Followed this recipe as much as I could, given my lack of ingredients. It was a hit and will become a new tradition. I used a 4 pnd loin which is all they had left at the butchers Christmas Eve, but still kept the same spice ratio. I also couldn't find any fresh thyme given my last minute shopping so I researched and found Rosemary to be pretty close and woks best with pork to achieve the same thyme flavor. After the initial high temp roast, I inserted an electric thermometer and checked periodically until it reached our desired temp and followed with aluminum tent. The family loved its tenderness. Thank you for sharing.

This was my first Rib Roast; and like some other reviews I was really skeptical of the receipe. I followed the directions to a T EXCEPT I cooked mine for 90 minutes initially because we like ours done NO Pink; I then left it in the  UNOPENED Oven for 3 hours; then I removed it and cooked my Mac n cheese and cornbread dressing. I put the Rib Roast back n the oven for 1hour to finish the cooking priocess; and I will tell you there was NOT any Roast left. This was the best receipe and I will be making again.  My  Roast was 4.60lbs  and I did rub it down with olive oil before seasoning with McComick steak season pepper and I also rubbed on some minced garlic. .
I did leave the roast out on the counter for 2 hours before I cooked it.

This is the best recipe for prime rib.  All the other recipes are going to the trash file.  Excellent with the mustard and horseradish rub.  He aged ours for 3 days in the fridge with cheesecloth.  Thanks for sharing!

This is  a perfect recipe -- the prime rib was perfectly done;very flavorful; and interesting that I left it in fridge for over 24 hours uncovered.  What a great idea!!

Make sure you allow roast to come to room temp - this is an important step in the timing of roasting.  Half hour at 450 and then I roasted for 45minutes at 350 and then 15 minutes longer to get thermometer  meat temp to 130.  Tented for 20 minutes- voila- PERFECT!!  Medium rare delectable beef!

Would have like to have had an idea of timing - but all went well.

Used minced fresh garlic(1tsp) mixed with spice rub - YUM!

Thank you, thank you - this is a REAL Keeper!!

This is the best prime rib I have ever had.  I followed the recipe to a T.  The best part is the rib roast came from Walmart at $6.97 a pound.  Just perfect. I'll never go out to eat it again.

This is the first time for fixing prime rib at Christmas and it was so delicious (better than any restaurant) and was enjoyed by the family of 10.I baked this 10# prime rib about 2 hours that was about 15 minutes longer only because we prefer medium well.  I did not make any additional changes and will definitely make it again.  Thank you for sharing your recipes.  Sue, Belpre OH

Turned out perfect. Made according to the recipe except for decreasing garlic powder to 1 tsp. After lowering the oven temperature, it took approx. 2 hours for a 7 lb. roast. Highly recommended.

However I did change up seasonings adding rosemary, salt,pepper , thyme and garlic  I did not use mustard or horseradish  that i left as optional spread on table for individual taste preference.  Everyone raved about it  I will be making this again and again

Flavors came out really well on this; I will definitely make again and use a larger roast. This was even more popular than the turkey on thanksgiving!

This is a fantastic recipe for prime rib. Loved the au jus!! Made it without horseradish, because I didn’t have any, but was awesome without it. Was very easy to make.

The roast turned out great!  I tweaked it a little by rubbing it with Olive Oil and covering it with a rustic herb mixture.  That made a great crust.  The hit was the gravy!  Very rich, tasty gravy.  Then, I used the left over gravy as a base for beef barley stew.  I threw in the left over roast and veggies.

Outstanding!  This recipe will replace our previous method of a dry-rub and garlic cloves.  We used the ratio of  1 day/pound to dry-age the beef.   We loved the horseradish/mustard mixture on the outside, along with the blend of spices.  The horseradish (hot variety) was definitely not overpowering.  We followed the recipe to the end of step 1, then my husband indirect  grilled the roast over charcoal with a drip pan underneath the roast.  We've done this grilling method many times, and it always comes out perfect.  We base grilling time on 20 minutes/pound of roast.  We remove from the grill when internal temperature reaches  120 degrees, then tent with foil and let stand 15 minutes.  Since there was just the 2 of us this time, we had a 1-rib roast.  They won't stay upright their own, so I used the tallest loop of our  beer can chicken stand to hold the roast upright.  It worked great!   I think a rib rack would also work good, but ours wasn't accessible.  Thanks for this delicious recipe.

For a 4 ribs size, I cooked it for one hour at 475 then I turned down to 400 until my temp was 150 , about another 45 min I think. Then I covered until the turkey was done. So tender and the crust was perfect. Everybody was talking about it.

This was my first attempt making Prime Rib. I also must confess I never had Prime Rib in my life. However, Christmas 2018 was a special one and I wanted to offer my guests a main course that was not the traditional ham. 

This was OUTSTANDING!

Not knowing what I was doing, I purchased a prime rib with bone. This ended up increasing the overall cooking time by a hour. I made the crust and placed it in the oven at 11:30am. By 2:30pm the roast was complete. I let it sit 30 mins. By 3:00pm, we were ready to eat. 

My guests had nothing but good things to say about the tenderness of the roast and the crust. They were extremely surprised when I showed them this simple recipe. They were under the impression, (similar to what I was until I found this recipe) you needed to cook the roast at a high temperature (500 degrees) then let it cool down for hours without opening the oven door. Now, I am not discrediting those recipes that instruct this method. I am sure there are reasons for this , but in a land of wannabe foodies this recipe was perfection! 

It made our Christmas 2018 so memorable.

I bought a  5.5 lb. rib eye roast (on the bone) from King Soopers stores at $4.47 lb.  I had the butcher cut the roast from the rib and had him tie it back to the bones (3).  It came out of the oven perfectly at 135 degrees.  When I cut into it, it was medium rare. Yummm.

So, I only gave it 4 stars because I followed one of the reviewers suggestions about roasting it at 500 and then turning the oven off and letting it sit undisturbed for a remaining 2 hours. Ok, I like the 500 roasting suggestion. The outside of the meat was perfectly brown and crispy; however, in hindsight, I would follow the original directions and keep it slow and low for the indicated time. By turning the oven completely off, the meat did not cook to medium rare like it did for others. It was really red, much more than I had hoped. Just wanted to pass my experience with this cooking method. Outside of that, I love the spice rub and the horseradish/ mustard mix. Made for an awesome gravy!!! All in all, i suggest sticking to the original directions if this is your first attempt at this recipe.

This is definitely a no-fail recipe.  Next time I will omit the tarragon & reduce the salt to 1 tsp., otherwise, the easiest & most delicious prime rib I've ever made.  I peeled the onion before putting it in the roasting pan.  I also  added the cooked veggies to a vegetable stirfry, they were too tasty to waste.

Awesome! Loved the crust on the meat. We added some fresh garlic to the meat rub and it was so good that we tried it also on a pork roll a few days later. It was even better on the roasted pork roll! We will be making this again soon!

I made this for Christmas Eve. It had the best flavor!! The best part to eat was the shell. The mix of seasonings was perfect. I did add a little water to the bottom of pan. The family was impressed. I'd make this again.

I made it exactly as instructed but made a larger cut - about 8 lbs. it was amazing. I made a bit extra of the au jus.  Normally I don't like to use prepared stock paste because I'd rather made it all from scratch, but didn't want to mess with anything from the way it was written. It was perfection.

This was the first time I've ever made prime rib. The recipe was fantastic. The prime came out beautifully, and the drippings made a delicious aujus sauce. I would definitely make this recipe again.

have used different spices for a rub.  the most important thing to keep is the temperature low after the first high temp time.
I have even reduced to 250 but adjusted the time to be longer.
watching the thermometer all the time and making sure it's pulled out at 135.

This was outstanding...However, I only used a little horse radish and Dijon mustard.  I didn't use anywhere near what was called for out of personal preference, not because it is bad.  I also took it easy on the salt and used salt free, granulated beef bouillon in place of the beef paste and it was delicious.  I had company and no one even mentioned salt even when I offered it to them.

This review is mostly just for the seasoning, which is really good. I accidentally left the oven at 450* for just over an hour. No matter; we just ate dinner an hour early! The roast was just barely overcooked after that mistake.

Made with a 7 rib -17 lb roast for Christmas to serve 16 ppl (there was also a spiral ham and sides) I tripled mustard and horseradish, kept thyme to single as specified in this recipe and doubled all other ingredients. Oven Seared at 425 for 25 minutes. Then low and slow for about 3.5 hours to achieve an internal temp of 120 (rose to 130 after 25 minutes resting). 

I was concerned when it started cooking - my whole house smelled like Thyme -this eventually subsided and the meat was very nicely flavored. (i.e. not too much Thyme)  I did place lots of carrots, celery and onions in the bottom of the pan and covered the vegetables in beef stock (but did not have the meat submerged in it) and this made for lots of tasty au jus which I did not thicken with cornstarch -just served with the meat. 

I did not attempt the "home dry age" as this process can be very particular and I do not consider my home fridge the right equipment for this process after working for a butcher and seeing this process and the controls applied there.

I was very nervous to cook this very expensive prime rib for Christmas dinner guests.  I  turned out perfect.  Followed the recipe exactly.  The au jus sauce thickened up the more it sat.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was absolutely DELICIOUS! I made this prime rib yesterday for company and was not sure if they would like it.   Big success! Just enough flavor and meat was so tender everyone was cutting it with their forks.  The only mistake that I made was not leaving it in long enough but was able to put it back in the oven and cook it a little longer. I based my timing for a 4 lb roast.   I will definitely be making this again.  Will  go according to the cooking time though.

Fantastic recipe!
Prime rib us expensive, so Inwanted a "no regrets" experience.  I scored a discounted 6 lb roast at the butcher, and followed the recipe very closely.  However, I left the bones in, and had to guess at the cook time.  Mine was closer to medium than mid rare.  Still delicious.  Highly recommend.

Actually going to be making it again for my sister in law and her bf this weekend for dinner per their request.

was always afraid to try a prime rib until now. we used a pair of 3lb cowboy steaks, which is esssentially the prime rib still attached to a large piece of rib bone. 

the recipe was super simple to follow to make it fool proof. the flavors were spot on, but i did use the dry seasoning more as a light rub on the outside edges.

everyone loved it. cant wait to try this with a 12 lb roast.

At least a week before I put garlic cloves halved into the meat ( I love garlic). I also let the meat rest at room temporarily at least 1 1/2 hours ( depends on the weight) before grilling any meat! The au jus can be made with flour (it’s heavier than cornstarch) also. Great seasoning!

Follow the times and temp, but I rub butter over the whole thing and lots of salt and pepper, I used Herbs de Provence. The 12.5ib roast came out at 140 internal after 24 minutes at 450 and 2 hours and change at 350. Christmas eve we ate half and the day after we sliced and reheat in broth and made the best sammies ever. Anything over 145 is garbage fit only for a dog you don't like. I will pan grill for those who can't do Mid- rare. But I will give you an evil eye while I am doing it. The son-in-law ran off with the bones saying something about his grill and being his.

I was a bit nervous about the coating, but it was universally pronounced "to die for"!  I had an 8 pound roast and had plenty to cover the meat.  I did not use vegetables, but the drippings were still good enough to make the au jus.

I followed Elizabeth Detrich review and the prime rib came out perfect and delicious. Thanks Elizabeth. I like my prime rib on the pink side so next time I will keep in oven after baking for 1 1/2 hours and not the 2 hours.

I just made this. Followed the directions as listed and it was fabulous (if I may say so myself lol.) I got rave reviews from everyone at Christmas dinner.  I bought an14 plus lb bone in prime rib. I had the butcher cut off bone then tie it back on.  I cut off about a third of the roast and froze for another day.  I was a little worried that the horseradish rub would be too spicy for a few of my guests but the cooking process rendered the horseradish into a very tasty crust.

I made this today for a dinner party.  It was great!  It had a nice tasty crust.  I dry aged the 6 lbs of prime rib Choice for 2 days and let the roast come to room temperature for 90 min. I used a thermometer from my over set to 130F. After the 30 min roast at 450F, the roast took another 1 hour 15 mins in a convection oven to reach 130F. Perfect!

This is a great recipe and it turned out beautifully! It wasn’t difficult to make for any seasoned cook. My family absolutely loved it! I’m making it again Christmas Day 2018 and am serving it with a delicious spinach blue cheese &  caramelized pecan salad, assorted fall roasted vegetables seasoned with butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg & cloves. I’m also making a small sweet potato casserole & homemade rolls. Desert will be a yummy cream cheese pumpkin pie! My mouth is watering already!

This  turned out quite well, recommended. I followed the recipe without any changes, though I did allow the roast to rest at room temperature for an hour (as suggested by other reviewers) before putting it into the oven.

I have made this for 2 consecutive Christmases. I skip the celery and use more carrots which then turns into a yummy side dish.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was a huge success. I followed the recipe exactly, but watch the temp, it took less than 2 hours, and was almost medium.

The rub & the a jus were superb! Many positive comments. I cooked the meat too long however at the 500 degree temp. Next time I will know how much time to give it.

No changes, and I will make it again!  This was an easy recipe and the roast came out very tender.  I did not have much juice to work with for au jus, however, for some reason.

Followed recipe pretty closely and it came out fine. Did not have beef paste, so substituted 1 cup beef stock with 1/2 cup red wine for paste/water. Will make this again.

I will say the ingredients are awesome and so is the flavor but the recipe states roast at 450 degrees for 30 minutes? We cooked our 6 pound roast for 60 minutes and our roast was not even close to being done in the middle. I love rare meat, not medium rare but rare and I can tell you this roast was not even close to being done. My disappointment is with the instructions not the ingredients.

Honestly,  perfect! (Do Not Deviate)
Possibly, only another 15 minutes required  depending on  the level of how well you'd 
prefer it done.

Buenisimo a mi me gusta a 130 F y el unico cambio que hice fue mezclar la mostaza Dijon con salsa de soya en lugar de horseradish.
