I made these for a cookie exchange and they are so good I can't stop eating them :)
Hints:  use good quality chocolate.  I replaced the 1/2 cup of chocolate with 3 ounces of Ghiradelli Semi-Sweet baking chocolate (chopped in small pieces).  Also, when folding in cocoa and chocolate -- don't over fold it!  I baked it for 15 minutes, turned racks, then continued for 10 minutes.  Turned the oven off and let them remain in the oven for an additional 5 minutes, then cooled them on a cooling rack.  If they lift of the parchment paper - they're done.

I am a 10 year old boy and these were epic. I made them and        
they turned out perfect. I did 45 minutes instead of 30.

These were light, delicious, and satisfying.  I just loved these.  They are as good as chocolate chip cookies, but a little more special.  I didn't have mini chocolate chips and the regular worked just fine.  I did sift my cocoa first before folding it in.  I made a batch with room temperature egg whites and one with egg whites that were cold, and the room temperature whites made a fluffier cookie.

Oh my GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!  Soooo, I made a German Chocolate Cake yesterday and I can NEVER find anything appealing.  This time I remembered that my one of my grandmother's friends used to make this chocolate cloudy looking thingys (that I can't think of for the life of me), so I came here & keyed in "cocoa" & "egg whites" as the ingredients and these little beauties popped up.  

I actually had 4 egg whites, used a bit less sugar (maybe a TBSP less) and added a capful of coffee extract.  BAAAAAAABYYYY!!!  YES, I WILL be making these again.  They actually taste like a light dark chocolate cookie cloud.  The cocoa gives them a cookie/spongecake-like texture on the inside.  

Oh, I didn't have mini chips, so I just took some regular chips & put 'em in the food processor for a minute or two.  DELISH!

Kind of tastes like chocolate ice cream minus the cold and the cream, if that makes any sense. Will definitely make again and they are super easy.

Excellent recipe.  Cookies were 'melt-in-your-mouth'! Light n crispy on the outside and a little fudgy inside. The kids loved it! I baked it for approx 45 mins though.

These were super tasty and fun to make but the middles were still gooey a few hours after they cooled. At 30 minutes, they were dry to the touch, lifted off the pan smoothly and were beginning to brown.  Iâ€™m wondering if they should be baked longer at a lower temp.

Yummy. Easy. And quite sweet, maybe a little less sugar next time. Chocolate chips and pecans are a must, lol.

I loved it.  I had no trouble getting the meringue to form stiff peaks, and my egg whites were cold.  I think I made them a big large.  My  family loved them.  Definitely doing this again!

Very tasty recipe which turned out crisp meringues.  I just wish when I piped them into stars they stayed that way.  They flattened into rounds.  I used cream of tartar instead of corn starch to make them corn free.  I will have to try the corn starch next time.

I've succeeded at making meringue cookies in the past; however, at 30 minutes, although these cookies were "dry to the touch", they were still uncooked inside. After completely cooled, they were soft and chewy -- not light-and-crunchy.  Was it supposed to be "hard to the touch"?

Perfect, easy recipe to use up leftover egg whites. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out awesome. I made them a little big, used a tablespoon. since they do expand, I'd recommend making them pretty small. Gives you more in quantity and makes them easier to eat!

I had egg whites left over from another dish and I was just trying to use them up and seen this recipe. I am totally shocked how  great these are! I put the mix in a baggy and cut a corner to pipe onto a cookie sheet. These looked so cute and just melt in your mouth!

I wanted to love this, I really did, but I didn't. My hubby loved them and I did find the texture improved slightly the next day.  I also think it might be a matter of using a high quality chocolate chip. I'm going to try making this again with half a batch with Reese's pieces and the other with skor bits. I'll update the review if I do.

I was so desperate to make these that I used regular sized chocolate chips because that's all I had on hand at 8 o'clock at night! The cookies still turned out great! Super easy.  Impressive  delicious.
