I used 2 cups garbanzo beans cooked from dried beans.  This has a strong peanut butter flavor!  Good with veggies!

I wouldn't personally trade it for tahini sesame paste, but its depth of flavor is very good. My recipe was a little short on fresh lemon juice, making it a bit dense and heavy, and I added 3 tsp. of curry powder (a little richer than most, I would guess) for a certain "must-have" flavor.

I think the parsley enriches its flavor and that the sesame oil also adds extra depth.

I found it amazing served with whole wheat pita bread, even if it was too dense.

How would other readers fluff up a dense hummus?

I didn't feel like buying tahini so thought I'd try this.  It's pretty good!  I made it with hot chili oil (sesame oil base) and drizzled in about 1/8 cup of reserved garbanzo liquid to thin it out.  Told my son it's PB dip and he ate it on banana chips.

I did this a little different and just used the EVOO and peanut butter and salt. Mixing it up until it was completely incorporated.  The night of it was great!  The next night it was even better, the peanut taste really came through.  Took it to daycare and the kids ate it on bread instead of peanut butter -- none came home.  I loved it on toasted bagels and the kids ate it with apples.  This would be great for a fall event.

I loved this! Had mixed reviews from the crowd, though. This is one of those you either love or hate. And I loved it!

I don't know - it just wasn't something I'm crazy about. I love hummus and I love peanut butter, but together they just weren't good.

Made this last night for supper with raw fruits and veggies, crackers, and a boiled egg for each of us.  Adults and kids (11 months and 2 1/2 years) loved it!!  The older one kept saying "dee-weesh-iss"!  We'll definitely be having again.  It was pretty thick following the recipe so I added a bit more lemon juice and a few drops of water just to make dipping easier.
