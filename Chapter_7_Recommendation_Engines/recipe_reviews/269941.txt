We really loved this recipe.  It's not spicy like my wife thought it would be.  It's more on the sweet side, but not too much.  This will reheat well, and it's very filling.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Hillshire Farm's recipes are pretty good.  This is the second one that I've tried and really liked.

This recipe is very good. I made half a recipe and used a few things I had on hand: 1 can of black beans, 1 can of red kidney beans, only 1 tbsp of brown sugar, green pepper instead of the chipotle. It came out great!

Actually, have not made yet, but have been cooking long enough to say this sounds good!
