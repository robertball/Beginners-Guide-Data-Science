Self-rising flour is not necessary, I subbed AP flour with excellent results.  I also omitted the coconut.  Otherwise, this recipe is great exactly as written, a family favorite.

Delicious.  I followed the instructions listed, but I used almond extract instead of vanilla, on accident.  It still came out really good though.  Mine was puffed up like in the picture, but after some cooling time, the middle sagged down.  I assume this is normal.  also, using the mini chocolate chips, they still fell towards the bottom a little as it was cooking, but not very bad.
