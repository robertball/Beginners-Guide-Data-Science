I love potatoes on the grill - heck I love anything on the grill! I must say and agree with the other reviewers that this definitely needs some seasoning and the veggie flakes just aren't necessary especially when you have fresh veggies already in the pouch. I added some minced garlic and used smoked paprika vs. regular. I also used Land O Lakes Lite butter - overall, very good!

These would indeed have been fantastic had the recipe called for some seasoning.  Any herb would work, garlic maybe, or even a seasoning blend of some sort. Easy enough to fix.  The vegetable flakes weren't a necessary addition as they really didn't contribute anything.  The peppers, mushrooms and onions, on the other hand, did, particularly the peppers.  They added wonderful flavor as well as color.  I didn't use nearly as much of the peppers as the recipe called for, however, just threw on enough till it looked right for me.  I did use the paprika, but that wasn't nearly as important as some seasoning would have been. I also used real butter, not the reduced fat spread.  While these can be improved upon simply by adding seasoning, they still were delicious and looked very festive.

First day of monsoon season, so it is finally cool enough to grill outside! Needed something to accompany our organic rib eye steaks, and the hubby wanted foil packet potatoes. I cubed the russets and used a green bell pepper, as that is our preference. Halved the onions, and sliced thickly. Used five organic white mushrooms (could use more). Half a teaspoon salt (not enough). Have never heard of vegetable flakes, so sprinkled with (spicy) Mrs. Dash, on the advice of other reviewers. Used 2 T unsalted butter, and 1 T olive oil (to prevent sticking in lieu of cooking spray). Forgot to poke holes and took 40 minutes in the top rack of our gas grill. Hubby was over the moon about these -- I will keep tweaking and report back...

This is a quick and simple method to cook your potatoes on the grill along side of your meat of choice.  I did leave out the mushrooms (added more peppers) and not sure what vegetable flakes are, so I used Mrs. DashÂ®.  The ingredients cooked up nicely, but I had to leave on the grill about 40 minutes.  This recipe will be use often now that it is grilling season in Indiana.
