I'm not sure how to rate this recipe.  The recipe is really good, the keilbasa tastes wonderful in this delectable sauce... but this shouldn't be cooked in a slowcooker.  At the end of the 5 hours, I got sausage mush... which I should've expected because keilbasa is alreay cooked.  Horrible in the slowcooker.  Tried this again but heated the concoction up on the stove for a few minutes and it was delicious.  Don't do this is a slow cooker!

I added sliced carrots, onions and peppers to the recipe and cut the brown sugar in half.  The sauce was great served over rice.  I did thicken it a bit with corn starch and added a little vinegar for a nice sweet/sour taste.  Next time I will try it with chicken instead of the kielbasa.  Great recipe.

This recipe is so easy! And the smell as it was cooking drove us all crazy! I did cut WAY down on the brown sugar, though, using only 3/4 cup. I also added 1/2 green pepper, chopped and 2 Tbls. dried minced onion. It made too much sauce for our use, BUT I saved the extra sauce and added it to some cocktail links on hand. My teenage boys loved that to snack on! Diane :-)

This was a nice suprise and fairly easy too.  I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups ketchup, 1 cup applesauce,  1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1/2 tbsp red wine vinegar, and 1/2 tbsp worcestershire sauce. Very Good! Added pineapples a few hours after kielbasa.

This was fantastic!  I would HIGHLY recommend starting with 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and adjusting to your taste.  That is what I used and it was sweet.  I also added some green pepper and onions which I left in rings which I believe heightened the flavors and added color as well.  I served this over white rice as others suggested.  Family loved it!!

I combined this recipe with Party Kielbasa (also on this site) because when I initially made the first recipe, I thought it would be great with pineapple added.  When I found this recipe with the pineapple, I read the reviews and since so many others thought it was too sweet, I used the grape jelly from the first recipe instead.  It definitely is better with the pineapple but I didn't really like the almost stewed pineapple.  Next time, I would add towards the end of the cook time.

This dish is YUMMY! My daughter and husband both loved it! I served it with potatoes and corn. It is also very good served over white rice! The sauce was a bit too sweet though,so the next time I make it I will cut the amount of brown sugar down to one cup or maybe even less. I am anxious to take this to our next pot luck! I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the sausage does get mushy when cooked for the designated length of time. So I cut the cook time way down, just enough to get everything heated through.

This recipe is awesome!  Made it a bunch of times and finally feel that I have perfected it.  I cut the 2lbs of kielbasa into bite size pieces then browned them in a pan with a little bit of oil.  If in a hurry I would throw them in without browning them first but they tend to come out mushier that way.  After browning I put them on a plate with paper towel to soak up some of the oil then throw them in the crock pot with Â¾ cup brown sugar, 2 cups of Ketchup, 15oz can pineapples chunks undrained, 1 cup of teriyaki sauce, 1 red onion sliced, 2 green peppers sliced. 4 hours on high served over white rice.  It has quickly become a party favorite and everyone asks for the recipe.

I made this for a luncheon at work and everybody loved it.  I did take the advice of others and cut down on the brown sugar and ketchup.  Will definitely make again for a cocktail party.  Not sure I'd want to eat it for a meal though.

I used only 3/4 cup of brown sugar and the recipe turned out great.  I took this to a party as an appetizer - simply unplugged the crockpot and brought along with toothpicks.  Everyone loved it!

Quick and simple.  Not bad.  The original recipe is a touch too sweet, so I cut back the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, and to counter some of the sweetness from the pineapple juice, I added in 1/2 cup spicy brown mustard.  I used a bigger, 20 oz can of pineapple chunks (undrained) as well as adding in 1 cup diced onion, 1 cup diced green pepper, and 1 cup snow peas...served over brown rice and was very appetizing.  I would suggest adding some other sides if you're wanting to turn it into a full meal.

I love this recipe! 
I did cut down the brown sugar to 1 cup as everyone suggested... and instead of putting everything together I fried the kielbasa (thankyou to the person who reviewed that it turned to mush when kept in the slow cooker...when reading the recipe I thought that may happen as well!) separately then added it to the sauce after it was finished cooking. I only cooked the sauce for 2 hours. I did add 1 green pepper and a half of a large yellow onion chopped big...the lower cook time allowed the vegies to remain crisp and the extra kielbasa (I used 3 packages) used up all of the sauce nicely. I kept in the refrig. over night and set the crockpot for warm the next day! I used this as an appetizer while we were waiting for Thanksgiving dinner! It was all gone with-in 2 hours...everyone loved it!  Thankyou all...for the wonderful recipe... and the excellent reviews that led to such an amazing appetizer! I should also let you know that I just bought the Hamilton Beach set and go slow cooker about a month ago and love it. Except for the probe...it's not long enough to reach the smaller pieces of meat...other then that it's great...I love the lock on lid...and the three different modes. I only tell you all this because I researched alot of  crock pots/ slow cookers...and their reviews...and thought I could hopefully save anyone else the trouble. Anyway enjoy this great recipe! Thankyou all again!

I gave this a 4 NOT because I didn't like it........because I did!  I just thought it was a little too sweet to be awesome.  Next time I will cut down on the sweetness a bit and add some green peppers to the mix.  Yummy with some sticky rice on Super Bowl Sunday!!

I agree with most of the posts on this and was glad I followed everyone's advice... I had forgotten to plug in my crock pot- so I had 3 hrs and did it on high for 2 and low for 1- glad I reduced it, or my meat would have been mush. 5-6 hours would have been WAY too long- even on low. I used 1 1/2 cups ketchup and 1 cup brown sugar and that was PLENTY! I also used the juice from the pineapple in the rice- Im glad I didnt put the juice in the crockpot- would have been too sweet and too watery. I put the pineapple chunks in at the end, just long enough to heat. Overall, this was great and super easy with only a few ingredients. I called it sweet and sour hotdogs... my kids NEVER would have eaten "kielbasa"! LOL.

Delicious & very easy to make.  Followed the suggestions to reduce ketchup & brown sugar to 1-1/2 cups & 1/2 cup, respectively; also added 1/2 cup each of chopped green peppers & yellow onions. For a thicker sauce, drain pineapples, but  reserve approx 1/4 cup of the liquid & add it to the mix.  If you're short on time, use skinless kielbasa & cook 2hrs on high.  Prepared a batch for ofc potluck & everyone loved it!! Served over jasmine rice.  Can't wait to try substituting shrimp for the kielbasa.

The original recipe does call for too much sauce and sweetness. I did this with 3lbs sausage, 2 cups diced bell pepper, 1 cup diced sweet onion, 1 cup ketchup, and 1/3rd cup brown sugar. After it had cooked for a couple hours on low, I added two cans (drained) chunk pineapple.

This was quiet good - surprising really for something so simple! I used chicken kielbasa as a personal preference and cut the sugar in half based on the reviews. I tossed in some diced bell pepper, cooked it on the stove for about 15 minutes, reducing the liquid at the end, and served it over rice. Quick & easy!

This is a very simple dish and when I've forgotten to thaw anything out, I can pull out the kielbasa and slice it frozen.  I put in about 2/3 cup brown sugar.  I start it on high until it gets heated through, and then turn the temp down so it can cook for a couple hours.  I thicken it with cornstarch/water.  Thanks for sharing!

I started off using half BBQ, half ketchup and added fresh ground pepper. After finger-tasting it, I added a little liquid smoke, Frank's hot sauce, worchestershire and dijon mustard. That helped it be a little less ketchup-y. I served this with Day Before Payday Fried Rice and garlic broccoli. Okay doctored up, I can't imagine eating this with just hot, sweet ketchup. This really does call for too much brown sugar. I should have halved it.

This was so delicious! I usually fry kielbasa so I was looking for something different. It does make a lot of sauce and is very sweet, I used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and next time will only use 1 cup. I just made more rice for the extra sauce! The kielbasa is so tender and goes great with the pineapple. I served it over rice but next time will try to think of something else to add to it like a veggie. It's just kielbasa and pineapple, something added to the mix would make it even better. Thanks for sharing this easy, delicious recipe! :)

Made exactly as recipe specified, but then added green peppers and whole mushrooms.  Served over white rice.  It was very good for the minimal effort expended.  My son mentioned that it smelled like sloppy joes due to similar ingredients.  Very sweet.  If I make again, I would definitely cut back on brown sugar.

I enjoyed this.. I did add snow peas, shredded carrots and onions..added them a bit later than the sausage so they wouldn't get mushy. I also ran out of ketchup so I had to augment with some bloody mary mix.. tasty dinner. I served this over shirataki noodles

The sauce tastes really good but I was so distracted by the color - Mine ended up really red, and I just couldn't get past the bright red sauce. I ended up adding food coloring until it turned brown so that it would be more visually appealing. Other than that - really delcious. I followed others suggestions and cooked just long enough to heat through - (maybe that is why my sauce never turned brown like the picture shows).

A nice easy recipe. I followed a few of the suggestions in the reviews -- I cut the brown sugar to 1 cup, and instead of adding everything to the slow cooker at once, I mixed the sugar, ketchup and juice from the canned pineapple in a mixing bowl then poured over everything in the slow cooker so that the tastes would be evenly distributed; I also added a few dashes of light soy sauce. I also added 2 cut up bell peppers (1 red, 1 green) and a couple of cups of sliced carrots to make it a one dish meal (so I wouldn't have to cook a separate veggie). Came out pretty good served over rice -- next time I may substitute bottled chili sauce for the ketchup (or maybe do a half and half) and see how that does. This recipe is a keeper.

I should've put less sugar..but I forgot to read the reviews again before I put it all together and it turned out WAY TOO sweet!  Nobody really liked it. Will not make this again.

This dish is delish!  I love the sweet sauce, and it reminds me of an appetizer my favorite aunt always makes.  I can't wait to make it again, next time I am going to serve it as a main meal over white rice.

Great on sandwiches!!! I followed others advice and cut the sugar. I used 1 cup loosely measured, to 3 lbs of kielbasa, 1 1/2 cups ketchup, 1 can unsweetened pineapple tidbits.
I cut the kielbasa lengthwise in half and to size for the rolls I had. Put in all in the crock pot with 2 green and 1 yellow peppers on top.  Heated for 3 hours and served at a picnic.  I was shocked to see when I went back for seconds that the crock was wiped cleaned.  Everyone enjoyed them.  The meatballs that usually go were left.  This made fantastic sandwiches, and I will be making this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

RE-REVIEW. So this time around I am caring what I eat. So I skipped the brown sugar entirely, subbing agave nectar. I would suggest adding it to suit tastes. I would not sub 2 cups or even 1 cup! I added steamed carrots and green peppers. ORIGINAL REVIEW I did cut the ketchup and sugar down as suggested. I had 2 lbs of kielbasa and to my dismay, it was so tasty, between the two of us- 2 lbs was not enough! I made with white rice.

This was an awesome delight. My family went to town and back for 2nds and then asked for more for a late night snack...cool by me. I took the orginial recipe and just converted it to healthier ingredients but staying true to what the ingredients were. I merely took Ketchup and used low-sugar Ketchup, I used a brown sugar sub in place of regular, and I used Pineapple sweetened with Splenda verses, the regular and I replaced the regular kielbasa with Turkey brand kielbasa. All in all it was totally delish, but I did find that in the slow cooking process, there was a ton of sauce. SO lucky for me I had extra packages of Turkey Kielbasa and I ended up using 2 more packages then requested in the orginal recipe. Which again was fine becuase my family loves leftovers. Then served it on top of rice. Will be making my modified healthier verison from now on.

this was not nasty but really not something I'd make again.  Even with the suggestions of lowering the brown sugar it was still WAAAAY too sweet (and this coming from someone with a sweet tooth).  The ketchup was overwhelming also.  I don't even get the name either... what's so "Island" about this dish?  it was not a good dish for an appetizer or main with rice.

My family loves this dish served over rice.  I have made it 3 times in the last month... I think it is a little sweet and am working on tweaking it a bit.  Still, very easy and delicious.

This was far too sweet for my tastes, almost sweet and sour, but without the sour.  I'd cut some of the brown sugar and add vinegar to keep from going into diabetic shock.

Awesome quick recipe. After reading most of the reviews I opted to make on the stove. Reduced brown sugar to 3/4 cup. Simmered with peppers chunks (2 green, 1 red) until tender. Added turkey sausage, pineapple and sliced water chestnuts. Served over rice. Will definitely be making again.

I cut this recipe in half and then cut back on the brown sugar even more (maybe 1/2-3/4 c. loosely not packed) cooked up an onion and the kielbasa together then dumped the rest into the pan and let simmer for about 30 min on the stove top....it was yummy! Everyone enjoyed it served over egg noodles....I'll be making it again with chicken and maybe pork too.

This was very good.  I made this with rice, and asparagus as side dishes.  All the family loved it.  I used Turkey Kielbasa.  I also used more Keilbasa than was called for.

Yum! Really Good! but in all fairness I have to only give it 3 stars. I changed it alot based on many peoples reviews. First off I added 1 cup chili sauce, 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 brown sugar to crockpot. Than I sauted a green pepper, an onion and the kielbasa. Than added that to crockpot along with the pineapples and juice. Put on low for 3 hours than ate it all up:D A really nice sweet and sour recipe. And like other reviews have said it would be great with chicken or shrimp.

Good recipe, but needs modifications to make it 5 star.  I used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup chili sauce.  I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and that was plenty sweet.  I also added a chopped onion and green bell pepper.  I served over rice and it was very good.  It does make a lot of sauce.  Next time, I may add corn starch to thicken as others have suggested.

Was a good dish.It has to be slow cooked as the recipe say's in order for the sausage to come out so tender, plus like a few of the others have said I cut down on the brown sugar. This dish is an "AGAINER"

We loved this recipe!!  I always follow the recipe to exact, the 1st time I make them.  The Kielbasa was super moist, and the flavor was really, really good.  All 4 kidos enjoyed it as well as my husband.  We served it over rice.  Next time I might add a chopped up green pepper as someone had suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very tasty - I added skinless chicken parts with the kielbasa. Next time I would use only the thighs which came out tastiest and the Kielbasa was excellent.  I am going to try it with bottled honey bbq sauce instead of the ketchup and brown sugar to make it even easier!!

Pretty good! I made a few changes... I used half ketchup and half hickory barbecue sauce, cut the sugar in half and I threw in some onions and green peppers cut into big chunks. Oh, and I used cocktail sausages for convenience. Went over pretty well at our potluck. Big hit mostly with the guys. Might make again but probably not for a while.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I cooked on the stovetop rather than the slow cooker as mine would have been plugged in about 9 hours.  I only had 1# of kielbasa so I halved the recipe, but needed to stretch it a little further, so I added some steamed carrots, and red & yellow peppers.  We liked the sauce the ketchup and brown sugar made and it thickened up nicely on the stovetop.  I served this over white sticky rice along with "Sweet Restaurant Slaw" from this site.  The meal was delicious and I will be making it again.

Thought it was to sweet, and I only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  If I made it again I would DRAIN the pineapple chunks before putting in the crock pot.

Fantastic! Super simple for a busy Mom. All 3 of my boys loved it. Came home for lunch, put it all together in under 10 minutes and dinner ready when we got home! You have to try this. This is my new potluck recipe. Actually went to the store tonight and making it again for a family get together tomorrow.

this was OKAY i guess, we ate it and it was easy. seemed to be missing something though. i added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies to it, and alot less brown sugar. it was still sickening sweet though.

Not so good.  Everyone loved it except for me.  I think it is lacking something......I read the reviews and reduced the brown sugar and added some spicy brown mustard.  IF I make it again, I will add some apricot preserves to this to see if it makes it better.  Not a fan of this!!

My family loved this recipe idea.  I made the changes the other reviewers suggested.  I cut the ketchup down to 1/2 cup, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  I also added in half the pineapple juice and tossed in Worcestershire sauce and vinegar.  I didn't measure these, just tasted as I went.  I tossed in a whole can of pineapple chunks and two big bags of mixed stir fry veggies.  Everyone ate huge servings of this over rice, very tasty and different!  The all said this was a keeper which made me happy cause it's so simple to make!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a fairly easy recipe, but one that is NOT actually easier in the crock pot.  I've found it much easier to just heat everything together over the stove, and serve over rice. The brown sugar can also be3 cut back as it is very sweet.

I did this in the slow cooker and I wouldn't recommend that; the kielbasa was overcooked since it's already precooked and the sauce was very acidic; I'm not all that creative in the kitchen so I'm not sure what I would have done to decrease the acidity.  I would probably decrease the amount of ketchup in the recipe.

My kids LOVE kielbasa, so I wasn't worried that they might not like it, I did add a green pepper and a red pepper and put it on top of white rice,  turned out fabulous! no left overs! (which is a plus!) Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!

Tried this tonight because we didn't have all the ingredients for our usual sweet & sour kielbasa reciepe - the family loved it even more than the recipie I'd been using for years.  Cooked on the stovetop for 1 hour on simmer - turned out great!

I love kielbasa and recently I have fallen in love with my slow cooker as well.  What I didn't like about this recipe was the fact that it contains pineapples.  I read the other reviews and decided to cut the sugar in half and I decided to add an onion.  After I threw everything in the crock pot it just didn't look spicy enough.  I added 1 tbls of Caribbean spice.  I took this as kind of a potluck dish to another family members dinner.  The idea being that if this tasted awful we would still have another dinner to fall back on!  There was no need for worry, this dish was amazing.  I served it over basmasti rice and it was absolutely delicious.  I will make this again and try it with shrimp next time, maybe even chicken.

Maybe it was our Kielbasa but cooking for this long made the texture or ours soft and grainy. Won't be making again. I much prefer to saute the same ingredients in a skillet.

This was a good recipe and I will use this again for a party or potluck. Like other reviewers, I cut the brown sugar in half. I also added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce as it was very thin. Edit: I doubled this recipe for a party and cooked it in the oven on low heat for a few hours. It turned out even better than the crockpot. The sauce was much thicker. I received tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. It was such a hit!

Well we just had it and let me tell you, the family loved it. My wife said that it wasn't something she would order out, but, if I wanted to make it 2-3 times a month she would love to eat it. We could absolutely see this made for our parties and family gatherings. Also, I also only used 3/4 cup brown sugar, added 1 med onion(diced up) and 1 green bell pepper (diced up)

This recipe is great for kids! But to make it easier the recipe can be changed to 1 package kielbasa sliced, 1 bottle of chili sauce, and 1 can crushed pineapples. It's so quick and easy to throw those three ingredients together you don't even have to measure. The pineapple chunks are too big for little mouths.

This is really good. I left the sauce as is, we like sweet, and I added chopped green and red bell pepper and a tiny bit of chopped vadalia onion. Very very good, my BF loved it and I will definately make this again.

As other reviewers recommended I used half the amount of sugar (1 cup).  Also, I used a 20oz can of pineapple, which is a little more than the recipe calls for. This definitely makes a lot of sauce.  Cooked for 6 hours on low and the kielbasa was very tender.

This was totally awesome.  I used sausage links (on hand) instead of kielbasa and it worked just fine.  This recipe has a nice sweet flavor.  We served it over rice which was a good compliment.  My wife has nick-named it "Sausage Luau."

Took everyone's advice added half the sugar, a little vinegar & onion. The sausage was great especially for the little one. Everyone loved - will make again.

This is a good recipe with some modifications.  I substituted the ketchup w/ brown sugar barbeque sauce and added only a 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also added green pepper and onion.  I've made this as an appetizer and topped it over rice to make it a meal.

Mmmm! This was wonderful. So easy to throw together and didn't take long to cook. Mine was done after 3 hours of being on low. So very good. The sauce was awesome! Thanks!!

This was terrific.  I used a 3 lb package of kielbasa, but otherwise kept the ingredient amounts the same.  I waited until the last 1/2 hour to add the pineapple as suggested.  My husband and kids devoured this. I thought I was making enough to have plenty of leftovers the next day for lunch, but my 11 year old picked out the few remaining pieces of meat leaving only the rice and sauce.  I can't wait to make it again, only next time I'll probably use at least 4 lbs of kielbasa.

I printed this out a few years ago and finally made it this weekend.  I wish I would have read the reviews first, because I, too, found it way too sweet.  If I made again, I would certainly cut the brown sugar down to 1 cup.  Good tasting, though.

I loved this dish but you do have to have a taste for it.  My husband thought it was alright because he doesn't like pineapple, and is not much for the sweet tasting dishes.  If you like sweet and sour chicken, you will love this.  I added sliced new potatoes to the crock pot and it turned out well.  I will make this again, only when my husband is out of town though.

This recipe was a hit with my family. Deliciouse.  I will decrease the brown sugar when I make it again.  When you go to reheat its a little too sweet for me,  but this is a great little dish.

I'm not giving this a rating, as I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but DON'T DO THIS: 1/2 everything except the pineapple (1lb sausage, 1 c ketchup) and use splenda in place of the brown sugar (1/4 cup). Perhaps I didn't add enough sweetness, or the acidity of the pineapple was too much, but it was SO vinegary no one could eat more than a bite, even with rice. Following the original recipe might render less intense results; however, given the overpowering acidity of the dish, I probably won't try again!

Wonderful!!  I only used 1 lb. of kielbasa, used crushed (not chunk) pineapple, and cut the brown sugar down to 1 cup.  I added one finely chopped green pepper and 1 tbsp. of Tabasco Soy Sauce.  Served over white rice - Yummy!!!!  Thanks a bunch - great for the very chilly evening we will have tonight!!!!!

This was ok.  I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup as others suggested and served this over rice. It was still sweet and the ketchup flavor was very evident. My 4 year old ate the pineapple and rice, my husband ate it, but asked that I don't make it again. We prefer our kielbasa cooked in barbeque sauce.

I added something to this and it was great.  A small can of marachino cherries.  Half at the beginning of the cook time and the other half toward the end.  The neighborhood went crazy over it at the potluck. There were no leftovers, even my 2 year old ate it.

I made some changes and it turned out delicious! everybody loved it at the Thanksgiving potluck we had. I totally agree that you need to cut down on the sugar so I used about 3/4 cup with about two and a half packages of the kielbasa sausage, but you can make more or less. I browned the sausages for a few minutes in a Skillet with oil then added to the crock pot then added the brown sugar and about 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce and 1/3 c ketchup..cooked on high for about an hour then added some sweet mini yellow and red peppers cut into strips then cooked for another 2 hours on low adding the pineapples with juice about the last 30 - 45 minutes. Yum, yum! Will definitely make it like this more often.

very good and yummy! I used only 3/4 cup of brown sugar and it was very sweet! I also added onions, like someone suggested... great add! It was very delicious over white rice, but this recipe seems more of an appetizer versus a main dish. I would make it again, but not on a regular basis

I use Heinz Chili Sauce instead of ketchup (more savory) and I brown the sausage before putting it into to the crock... then all the cook time in the slow-cooker is used for is to allow the brown sugar, pineapple and sauce to co-mingle with the kielbasa.  Always the first to disappear at any potluck event.

I made this just as you see it. Then, I put it over plain rice  It was very good, so good in fact that there wasn't enough left after dinner to take pictures of. My husband was a little worried when he saw the ingredients but he changed his mind after his 3rd bowl. I left it in the crock pot and warmed it up for lunch and now its gone. I think I am going to make one of the custom versions next time, just to see.

It was great.  We read the reviews, cut brown sugar back to 1 cup plus, added green and yellow pepper, started on high for 2 hours, reduced to low for 2 and it was great.  Actually better than expected.  Usually crock pot things lack flavor but not this.  By the way, the pineapple was fresh.  But definitely a repeat.  Thanks

I am surprised that this recipe got as many positive reviews as it did. I found it quite disappointing. I cut back on the brown sugar as suggested, and fried up the kielbasa first because I like it a bit crispy, but to no avail. This was SO sickeningly sweet- it was awful. The flavor was too overpowering for the vegetables and plain sticky rice that I served with it. I should have went with my gut on this one and passed it over. Definitely not my favorite. :(

My picky family LOVED this recipe! I added carrots and green pepper, similar to sweet & sour, and served it over rice! SO GOOD!

Have extra rice/potaotes ready as this makes alot of sauce!  I added red and green peppers as well and it really doesn't need to cook 5 hours.  3-4 should do it.

Like others I cut the brown sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, added some carrots and bell peppers. We had it over egg noodles with a salad. It made a wonderful dinner. My husband thinks this one is a keeper.

I loved this! I was in the mood for something exotic, and this was perfect! I made quite a few modifications, though: I halved the recipe, used 1/2 cup chili sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 can pineapple, and added red onion, a few drops of hot sauce, ground ginger, cumin, salt, and pepper. I feel bad that I altered it so much, but it needed some spices! I cooked it in a large pot on the oven for about 30 minutes, and served it over rice.

Based on others' reviews I only added 3/4 brown sugar, which was plenty.  Also, I added red and green peppers and onions.  I grilled the fresh kielbasa along with the peppers and onions, then added it all to the sauce.  I suggest that you use a bland bbq sauce for this and add 1 1/2 Tbls of caribbean jerk seasoning.  An overpowering or mustardy bbq sauce will not work here.  this recipe needs work

Very easy to make and tasted so good.  I added half an onion and half a bell pepper because I had some in my fridge that needed to be used.  The sauce was VERY thin so I added a little bit of cornstarch about 10 mins before I served it, it thickened it right up and come out perfect.  Will be making this one again and again with chicken and shrimp as well as the kielbasa.

Excellent flavor.  I also cut the brown sugar in half, but the taste was perfect.  If you like the sweet and sour pork at a Chinese restaurant, you'll love this.  Let it cook for hours, and then put it over brown rice.  I loved it that night and then took it to work for a few days for lunch.  Excellent!

Excellent taste, definitely the "potluck" style dish. Replace the ketchup with a good bbq sauce and halve or even quarter the sugar for more of a dinner entree appeal. we made this on the stove due to time constraints instead of the slow cooker and I would have to reccomend it instead.

Yummy!  Very sweet, which my family loves, but simple is what really makes it a keeper.  We loved it served over rice and found that it cooks well in a covered stoneware baking dish if there isn't time for the slow cooker.

I cooked this recipe just as called for except on top of the stove (less time). It was wonderful over a bed of rice! I needed the calories of the 2 cups of brown sugar, as I'm a cancer survivor trying to gain my weight back! This was sure to give me an appetite too!

This was not a bad recipe, but very sweet. we used less brown sugar and added some cayenne for a bit of spice. Everyone enjoyed the overall flavors but agreed that some peppers or onions would have been nice. it is alot of sweet sauce for only having sweet pineapple pieces and kielbasa. If I made this again I would add more veggies and possibly stick  it on the grill for the last 5-10 minutes to give it a nice added flavor and a little less saucy texture.

i've done this both in the slow cooker and in a frying pan and either way it's delicious. in the frying pan i just give the sauce a few minutes to melt together and cook down and then i add the sliced kielbasa. it's super easy and a tasty alternative to plain kielbasa. i use turkey kielbasa and serve it with salad and pierogies to complete the meal.

If you are looking for something different and like "sweet & sour" you might want to try this.

It probably won't go over well if you have a house of picky eaters.

I used crush pineapple, 1 can tomato paste, 1/2c brown sugar, 1 cup ketchup and after it had simmered I added some water to thin the sauce a little. Served it over rice.

Like many others I did think it was a bit sweet and "Ketchupie".  I added a can of tomatoe sauce and another can of pineapple chunks with juice (BECAUSE I LOVE PINEAPPLE SWEET AND SOUR DISHES...AND PINEAPPLE!!  ;0)  if your not a pinepple lover like me, tomatoe sauce helps tone down the ketchup and brownsugar.  I still will use a bit less brown sugar, 1/2 at least.Goes good with rice.  Next time I may add manderine oranges.

This is a good recipe, if it is not for a meal. It is a good party snack type food. I cooked it for dinner so I am giving it 3 stars, if it had been a party it would be 4 stars. 

I used one cup of brown sugar like people suggested and it was still plenty sweet. And I added the pineapples in the last 20 minutes of cooking, they were great and still firm.

I made this for a potluck at work, and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it. Flavor was great. The brown sugar is a great take on the classic ketchup and jelly combo.

turned out great. So many ways you can change this up to incorporate different ingredients with the Sausage and the sauce as a base.  Definitely adding this recipe into the meal planning rotation!

So-so!  Very watery sauce .  We served with rice which helped soak up some sauce, but  would not make again.  Flavor was OK, but seemed like sausage flavor cooked out of the meat after cooking so long.

" Its a Keeper" 
I only cooked for  2-3 hours total.   Started making the sauce first.  Only used 1 cup of brown sugar.  I also used the pineapple juice and added the pineapple  pieces later.   I did brown the kielbasa before adding  to the sauce.  Added thinly sliced sweet peppers and pineapple and heated through.  Served over  rice.

This the third recipe I prepared in my new slow cooker and the best one so far. SOOOO GOOD! I went a little easy on the brown sugar using only one cup as pretty much everyone in the reviews suggested and let it cook on low for four hours but otherwise, I made this as is. If you like kielbasa and pineapple, this dish is a must-have in your life. Since I made this for dinner and not a social function, I'm pretty excited that there's plenty of leftovers for supper later this week. Served it over rice with a side of green beans. Thank you for sharing! EDIT, WEEKS LATER: At least one person suggested that this same dish could be made on the stovetop. That is what I did this evening: I browned the kielbasa, added the rest of the ingredients and let 'er simmer on the stove for about an hour. Nope. It's not the same. It's barely edible, really. So you gotta go with the slow cooker on this one, folks.

Like most reviewers, I tweaked the recipe because I thought it would be way to sweet.  I also did mine on the stovetop.  1/2 cup brown sugar to one cup ketchup, 2T vinegar and an onion and unsweetened canned pineapple (canned in juice).

I made this once as it was and it was ok. The second time I made it I increased it to just over 3 pounds of kielbasa, I browned it in the pot then mixed the pineapple in and browned that with it while in a separate bowl I mixed the ketchup, brown sugar, pineapple juice, chili garlic paste and cayenne (we like it spicy) and poured it over. I let the entire mixture come to a rolling boil and then stuck it in the oven (in the pot) for a few hours till it turned into a nice thick saucy glaze. I served it with rice. The second version was fantastic.

This was so good! I used half kielbasa and half andouille sausage. Based on the other reviews I used just 1 c. ketchup but about 3/4 of it was a spicy Indian ketchup that i love and the rest regular ketchup. I used 3/4 c. brown sugar and it was perfect. I added the canned pineapples (20 oz. - that's what i had) and a sliced onion after about 2 or 3 hours and cooked for just over 4 hours. I also reserved about 1/3 c. of the pineapple juice for the rice (brown). I had 2 helpings and i have to restrain myself from having another! So, so good!!!

1/2 c. sugar instead of 2 c. and it was still quite sweet.  Cooked in oven for 30 min @ 375, stirring a few times.  Added bell peppers and onions.  Served over brown rice.  Very good with srirracha drizzled on top.

I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar, but it was still really sweet. So, next time I'll probably omit the sugar.  This dish was really good. I added onion, bell peppers and some BBQ sauce and cooked it in the slow cooker for about 3 hours. My sausages weren't mushy at all. I will defiantly make this again.

I like to double of halve this depending on the size of our crowd, and it is always something adults as well as children enjoy.

I usually choose beef sausage- chappell hill if I can find it.

I made many of the modifications mentioned: kielbasa cut into bite size pieces, brown with a large chopped onion, a red pepper and two green peppers, about a cup of chopped baby carrots and a large can of chunked pineapple, sauce reserved . Add to it a cup of ketchup, 3/4 cup of BBQ sauce, about 1/3 cup brown sugar, about 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. Add about 4 tablespoons of cornstarch to the reserved pineapple juice and add to pan. I just use a stockpot, it cooks for about an hour at which time I am cooking the rice in the rice cooker. Very good.

Way better than I was expecting! I tried this recipe on a whim because I was sick of chicken or beef every night. I didn't realize how much ketchup goes into this recipe so I kinda grossed me out at first. I added a couple tbsp of chili powder and it was awesome! Will def me making again!

It was good, but not great.  Even cutting the ketchup and brown sugar and adding red pepper, it was still too sweet.  If I make this again, I will cut the ketchup even more and use tomato sauce.

This was awesome! Super easy and really tasty. I didn't have regular brown sugar so I used 1/2 c Dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar to make the one cup suggestion from other reviews! Other than that I followed the instructions and had it over rice. My husband said it was pretty much the best thing he's ever eaten. :)

The sausage came out great and very easy to make.  The sauce was a bit sweet but I added a bit of cayenne pepper to add some spice.

I also took another reviewer's advice with the applesauce (though I used pear sauce as the applesauce jar had mold in it), AC vinegar, 3/4 cup of B. Sugar.. etc. Very well balanced! Delicious!! Will be making again!

Not bad.  Bf is picky with fruit in meat dishes, and he turned his nose up at the pineapple, but certainly ate most of it.  I'm simply not as big of a kielbasa fan as he is, but it wasn't bad.  It does make a lot of sauce and I didn't even bother with the sugar.  I didn't make this in the slow cooker, as our work schedules mean we are out of the house sometimes 10 hours during the work week, and I didn't want to over cook this.  So I made on the stove top, adding the pineapples later, then served over shells.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy, but too sweet for my tastes. I followed the recipe exactly. Would make again, but will cut down on the brown sugar and pineapple a bit.

I needed something easy that my husband could put together in the crockpot and this filled that requirement.  I cut the sugar as recommended and didn't have him put the pineapple in until the last hour.  The sausage was very good, the vegies, fruit and sauce were okay, still a little too sweet, imo.

Wonderful !!!.. Took the advise of other reviews and cut back on the brown sugar and I added the pineapple prior to serving. This is the perfect slow cooker, no fuss recipe. No more showing up empty handed with this one!

YUM!! I brought this for Potluck at work today and it was a HUGE HIT! I did revise with the advice of others- my changes: I used 3 links of sausage, 3/4cup of brown sugar, ADDED: 1 small onion sliced long and Thin, 1med green pepper sliced long and Thin. 1/4cup lemon juice. Threw all in crock pot and cooked on high for 2 hours, then on low for 1 hr.  called it âKielbasa Luauâ. Thanks!

Pretty good.  I cut down the sugar and thought it still a little too sweet.  I plan to do again though, with even less sugar.

This was just ok. DH & I agreed it was a 4.  Just wasn't that special, not the kind of dish you can't stop thinking about. I cut the sugar down to 1 C. The sauce was just sweet enough, anymore would have been too much. I added half a chopped onion, 1 small chopped green pepper & 1/2 1 lb bag of baby carrots (I now wish I had chopped those in half). Served this over white rice. The sauce is very soupy. I don't know what it is- maybe this dish needs a different sauce or some seasonings? I won't be making this again- I have too many wonderful recipes to make an ok one again.

Perfect recipe for a large gathering as it makes lots. I cut the brown sugar in half as other reviewers suggested and I also did not add as much pineapple as I am not a fan. Leftovers are great also.

I was specifically looking for a recipe for a potluck, and this didn't disappoint!  Very easy to make, and tasted great - there were no leftovers.  I prepared everything the night before, put it all in a Tupperware container, then dumped in the crockpot at work the next morning.  I cooked on low for just a couple of hours and it was perfectly fine.

This is great!  I made it for a potluck at work one time and now I always get asked if I am bringing the keilbasa when there is going to be another one.  I used 4 keilbasa links and the amount of meat with suace was perfect.  I think the amount in the recipe would have been a little too saucy.

Yes, this recipe is really easy, but I also think it is very shallow in it's flavor profile.  It definitely needs something to give it depth, I'm not sure if I'll take the time to mess with it!  Maybe just a chipotle ketchup would do the trick?

I really enjoyed this dish and thought it was great, but I think most people would find it a little on the sweet side. I'm really glad I followed some other reviews and added some chopped onion to help make the dish a bit less sugary. I'm going to experiment a little with this next time and see if we can get it to have a bit of a tang. Very good, I'll definitely try this again.

We had this dish last night, which was made exactly as the ingredients called for.  Tasty, but extremely sweet, I would advise to cut back on the brown sugar.   I don't think I would make this again, but only because we aren't into the "sweet meat" dishes.

Like everyone else I cut the sugardown to 3/4 cup.  the only down side was the sausage was a bit over cooked for us. Next time I'll put it in about 2 hrs later than everything else

This is a great recipe, I've made it several times now.  The one change that I would definately recommend is a reduction in the brown sugar.  I cut it down to one cup, and it's still plenty sweet.  It's a hit at my house, and I won't be losing this one anytime soon.  It also tastes great with 'Lite' kielbasa.

Very Tasty recipe. Good for potluck. Watch  it when you scale it for more people because it becomes a very large dish very quickly and you need a large crock pot for it. Got rave review. The office smelled good all day while it was cooking.

Not as sweet tasting as the ingredients make you think.  This was a great recipe for a work pot luck, since I could throw it in the crock pot and let it cook all morning.  I got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.

My family and I did not care for this recipe at all.  It tasted too much like ketchup.  We prefer kielbasa grilled with lemon juice or the traditional kielbasa and sauerkraut.

Delicious and filling! I've made minor alterations: I've used Butterball's turkey sausage kielbasa and it tastes so good. I've used Aldi's rice for the main meal and Minute Rice's microwaveable rice for leftovers. I'll make this again in a heartbeat.

Simple yet awesome!  Like so many others, I cut back on the brown sugar to 1/2 c. and added almost 1/2 c. splenda.  I also thought of adding a can of drained and rinsed cannellini beans.  I served it over medium shell macaroni.  Delish!

The recipe was easy, added green bell pepper and onion and cut sugar to about 3/4 C. and took to a potluck. It was very good that night and a couple of people wanted the recipe. I warmed the leftovers and didn't like it at all, which was quite surprising as I'm definitely a leftover person. It was way too sweet for me. Go figure.

I did actually make this recipe.   Iâm glad I read the reviews about it being very sweet.  I used about 3/4 cup brown sugar, drained the pineapple, used the Worcester sauce, sliced up a pepper, and cut the catsup in half. It was still very sweet. Put the crock pot on low. The sausage was fine. My son suggested using BBQ sauce vs catsup. HE said the catsup was overpowering. I will try it again, but will further cut down the sweetness. Thx u to whoever submitted the recipe!

Made it for Motherâs Day luncheon and it was a huge success. Only used 1 cup brown sugar. Was in the slow cooker about 2-1/2 hours so the meat wouldnât be mush.

Vampyra is right on, the kielbasa around here at least, is already cooked.  I liked the recipe, the family was delighted it was so good,  my only change was to grill the sausage for a few minutes on a hot grill with grill marks, and put it all on the stove to heat up for a few minutes.

I made this to take to a potluck at church. It was so easy to make and assemble for the crock pot. I did add sliced onions. cut way back on the brown sugar to just 3/4 cup, only 1 cup of catsup and didn't add the pineapple chunks till the last half hour so they weren't  mushy but did put the pineapple juice in it right away.  I also cooked it for only 3 hours and it came out great. It smelled so good as it was cooking and the taste was delicious. Would definitely make this again.

Everybody in our home loved this dish!!! 
I adjusted brown sugar to our taste and added  a little minced garlic and onion, I'm Italian can't cook without garlic ...lol, and instead of white rice I used jasmine rice with Badia brand Sazon Tropical seasoning, only we have 1 granddaughter that will not eat white rice...
She eat so much I had to make more rice! Before I could get a picture  it was all gone.
Thank you so much for sharing this simple yet awesome recipe!!!

I made this on the stove, because thereâs no reason that kielbasa has to be cooked for 5 hours. Great flavor - served it with plain buttered rice and green beans.

Very Good! I always read other reviews and suggestions and I did do as some others suggested...cut back on sugar and ketchup and added some diced onion.  Actually about a half cup of ketchup and half cup of BBQ sauce. I served it over mashed potatoes  and it looks like I'll have leftovers for two more days.

I've been making this for 15 yrs!  I was shocked to see this recipe here... I started laughing cause it's old.  I use chicken too,  but you have to cook it and drain it before you add it because if you don't it's watery.  You can use shrimp as well... Any protein,  it's all good in this sauce I also use red peppers and an onion for flavor.

There are some things that can be made in a slow cooker and some that shouldn't be. This is one of those shouldn't be things. Like vampyra1 said in her review, the Kielbasa is already cooked, so why heat it for 5 hours? Anyway, following her advice I made this on the stove, took no time at all and then served it over a bag of microwavable rice.  Was easy, fast and good. It's one of those...Hey, I've got some leftover Kielbasa from Easter and some pineapple from the fruit tray we had and a bag of rice. Bam! Great meal quick.

IMO it is too sweet if recipe is followed.   I cut sugar down by half the second time I made it and was just right.  Also added a chopped onion and also a chopped red and green bell pepper.  I cook sauce and veggies for 2 hrs, then add browned kielbasa and pineapple and cook 2 more.  Keeps them from getting mushy.

Made for the first time to bring to a party, the pot was empty within 15 minutes and everyone wanted more.  It's easy and delicious. 
I add some sliced sweet onions and it's perfection.

I used this as a snack, but if I want to make it as a meal then I would add some green pepper and maybe onions, then serve over rice. I did not use the precooked kielbasa but used our locally made, and because so many said there was so much extra sauce I added an extra pound.
Baked it for an hour then sliced it. It was fantastic!! Did not get mushy like others said.
My husband wanted me to use our locally made Brats, but I wanted to make the original recipe. I will definitely make this again as is and maybe be nice and make my husband some with Brats.

I used Italian sweet sausage since there was no kielbasa.....also added onions to the recipe. Loved it except it was too sweet, so next time I would cut sugar in half or by 1/3 at least. Itâs great over rice and party goers enjoyed it when I served it.

I have to say that I did not like the way this tasted. I did a couple of things differently. First, I was honestly skeptical about cooking the sausage in the slow cooker to begin with (as the texture just doesn't appeal to my household), so I followed one of the reviewers' suggestion of doing this on the stove top instead.  Secondly, I halved the amount of sugar the recipe calls for; and even then it was way too sweet. Finally, I added 1 tsp of red wine vinegar to try and kill the sweetness. 

I served it over plain rice, thinking that it would tame the cloying flavor of the dish, but could only stomach about half of what I put on my plate. My Husband enjoyed it, and that's why I am giving it an extra star. I will probably not make this again.

I should have read a few review before I made this. It was delicious and will give it five stars, next time. A little too sweet with the 2 cups of brown sugar. I will go with 1 cup or maybe a 1/2 cup.

I can see how this would be popular for a potluck.  I used two packages kolbasa and one Mennonite sausage. I used two cans of pineapple chunks. I took someone else's suggestion and used a half cup of BBQ sauce and a half cup of ketchup and reduced the brown sugar to a half cup, as well. I may try making it a meal with two red peppers and a red onion. Or, sautÃ©ing those and having them as a side along with the basmati rice. I cooked it for two hours on high, then one hour on low. The snow peas I'd added were cooked, but the carrots needed more than the three hours. I decided I didn't like the carrots in the mix anyway.

Didn't read the comments and reviews first, and wish I did.  Sauce was too sweet and thin.  We served this over white rice and it was good that way.  I really liked the kielbasa.  Not a fan of the pineapple.  Probably will not make this again, but I am glad I tried it.

I doubled the batch (was feeding 8 people!), served it over white rice, and there wasn't a morsel left. They loved it...including my picky kiddos. I took the reviews into account and did use 5 c of brown sugar instead of the 6 the recipe would have called for, but didn't add or take away anything else. It was perfect. Just the right amount of sweet. We will definitely be making again.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe... I've found you can also make it over the stove to,p just let everything simmer until warm. It's quick and easy - I also added onions and it makes it even more delicious! Serve it over warm rice and it's scrumptious!

I cut the sugar and ketchup in half, and I added carrots and green onions. And just for fun, I added 7 small apples that had been in my frig for a while. Other recipes added applesauce or apple cider vinegar, so I thought apples might add a nice touch to the dish. And it did. It was delicious! :)

As written, I think this dish would have been WAY too sweet.  I cut the sugar down to about 2/3 cup, and it was still really, really sweet.  I also added sliced carrots, onion, and green pepper.  Fried the kielbasa and added it to the crockpot just before serving.  I will definitely make again, but may switch out a cup of the ketchup for chili sauce to try to make it a little less sweet.

I love this recipe, to save time instead of ketchup and brown sugar I just use BBQ sauce. I also add green peppers and onions.

I made this on the stove top, and the flavor was great. I served it over basmati rice. My husband who is a chef loved it, and my picky child asked me to make it again. My only complaint is that it makes too much sauce. Next time I'm going to add carrots, cauliflower and broccoli and reduce the amount of sauce to half.

I made this recipe & incorporated all the reviewers additions/subtractions. I cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. Added onions, green pepper, carrots. I served over rice. I'm not much a pineapple person, but every taste held its own distinction. Very good recipe... certainly comfort food!

Very delicious. I cut the brown sugar in half (as many suggested). I couldn't find a 15 oz can of crushed pineapple, so I used 20 oz. Finally, I substituted half of the ketchup for barbeque sauce. Turned out great!

This is wonderful,  I added a drained can of pineapple rings and more Kielbasa,
there is lots of juice, so it worked out great.  This would also be great with meat balls. Thanks for sharing

As others said, this is pretty sweet. I like it that way but my husband doesn't. I'm going to halve the sugar next time and maybe add some mustard or tabasco so it doesn't taste too ketchupy - even worse than too sweet in my book! I didn't even bother with the slow cooker though - it tasted great just heated up in a pan and put over rice. I'm making it again tonight - yum!

This was ok. My husband and I did not like the big chunks of pineapple. If I make it again I will just use the juice. I also reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet. My house did smell wonderful when it was cooking.

Great recipe, but for one small glich in it.  Way too much brown sugar.  The large amount of sugar ruins the entire meal and makes it extremely sweet.  I will definetly make this recipe again, but next time I will only use 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

My husband doesn't enjoy main dishes with too much of a sweet taste, so I reduced the brown sugar by half, and it was still SO sweet, I didn't bother serving it to him.  My 6 yr old didn't even care for it!  I liked it fine, but not as a main dish-- I think it would do better as an appetizer tid-bit.  That's how I'll serve it next time (with toothpicks)!
