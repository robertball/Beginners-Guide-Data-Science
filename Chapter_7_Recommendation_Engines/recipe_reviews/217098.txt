My extraordinarily picky hubby stated, this is a meal I would pay $50 in a restaurant for.  He ate all the leftovers, this is a feat not frequently accomplished in my home!

I didn't have mushrooms and did not add the tomato, but it was excellent without them.  Will definite add to my favorite recipes.

There was no indication in the recipe whether to cover or not; I chose not and the chicken did not cook. Half an hour after the appointed time I gave up and broiled them to finish them. Carrot and potatoes needed to go into the microwave. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'm convinced it's a good recipe, I will cover it and see what happens. If I'm right, I'll up my rating.
