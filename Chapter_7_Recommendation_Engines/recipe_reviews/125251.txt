I made these last weekend for our church.
I have already had request for the recipe.  Next time I will not try to spread the marshmallows, mine seemed to stick togather.  They were just fine before I tryed to spread them.  If you make sure that they are in a single layer and even all over I think it would work better.

These are GREAT!!! I took them to some friends and every one went nuts over them!! Try putting a little bit of butter on your knife and pat the marshmallows instead of trying to spread them. A sure hit!!!

When my friend made these as part of my Christmas present, I thought they were some of the best bars I'd ever eaten!  When I made them, however, they were pretty sub-par.  I was so disappointed.  It was tricky to get the bottom cake-layer just right, not underbaking, but not overbaking either, knowing that it was going to be put back in for an additional 2-3 minutes.  I overbaked mine accidentally.  I also had a hard time making the chocolate layer spread.  No other reviewers mentioned it, so maybe it was just me.  I think next time (and there definitely will be a next time!), I will add just a little milk to make it more spreadable.  I LOVED the flavor and texture of these bars, so I will have to practice making them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made these as a trial run for a Christmas cookie exchange and I loved them!  I am definitely making these again!  Spreading the marshmallows was a little bit challenging but the chocolate top layer covers them so the marshmallow layer doesn't have to look pretty.

I have made this slightly easier.  I used a box brownie mix instead for the cake layer and baked as directed minus a couple minutes.  While the brownie was cooling I took 40 big marshmallows and 3 tbs butter and melted in saucepan on low creating an more easily pourable liquid.  I poured the melted marshmallows on the cooling brownies so there was no spreading problems. (this way the marshmallows dont need to go in the oven nor do you have sticky knife issues) I placed this double decker portion in the fridge to cool just a little while I made the chocolate peanut butter portion, then spread that on top and placed back in fridge and then cut into squares after cooled.  I think next time I will use marshmellow cream spread over the top and bake that a couple minutes for a toasty middle.  But good recipe and idea.

Excellent Bars!! And if you are lazy like me you can substitute the cake layer with a boxed brownie mix. Both ways are absolutely delicious!

Mmmm...these were so yummy. I'm not a big peanut butter fan, so I substituted Hershey's Cinnamon Chips and the smell was HEAVENLY. I love how the crispy top layer tasted with the mashmallow.

I read reviews in advance and ended up patting down the melted marshmallows with a large spoon dipped in butter. I had no problems with that step.

Like other reviewers, I too had a problem with the bottom layer. I used a smaller pan and baked it longer, but it tasted like undercooked dough. Also I found that the whole bar lost its shape easily if the room temperature was too warm, so I kept it refrigerated.

I would make this again with a much wider pan. Overall it was delicious.

These are wonderful.  It took me a while to find this recipe after tasting these at a party that was catered.  I would eat the whole pan if I hadn't given them away.  But everyone was so grateful for me doing so and they loved!!! them and said the couldn't stop thinking about them.  Note:  I did use marshmallow fluff since it's easier to spread and it turned out great and is still ooey gooey in the middle.
***Have now tried a brownie mix for the base and it's just as good and a little quicker to make.***

Pretty good, although the base was a little more cakey and not as chocolatey as I expected. I would recommend using a brownie base instead. The topping was fantastic!

This recipe definitely isn't bad, I just wouldn't call it wonderful. It has a good taste, but it's not anything extraordinary. I suppose it's just a typical dessert, but if you like marshmallows and chocolate you'll like it. The cake on the bottom was the only part of the recipe that I'm not sure if I like or not.

I'm not an expert chef, but I could NOT get the top to turn out right! It was too thick and wouldn't spread. :(

These were absolutely delicious!  I didn't have a beater on hand so I used a different brownie recipe for the base, cutting the requirements in half.  My favourite part was definitely was topping - I was afraid it would be too peanut buttery, but it turned out deliciously!  A perfect alternative to brownies and rice crispies!

You Can't Please Everybody, That's what i'm learning.  I made this recipe for my husband to take to work and share with his co-workers.  I got mixed reviews.  Everyone loved them, but some said they thought the marshmellow was a bit much, and my husband thought there was way too much peanut butter flavor.  I will definately make again, but next time i will cut back on the amount of peanut butter.  Thanks for the Recipe, It really looked good, if i didn't make it i would have thought it was store bought.

These were okay, but not great, I doubt I'll make them again without some major changes. Like other people suggested, I used a boxed brownie mix for the base which worked well. I didn't have any problems spreading the marshmallows, I just used a spoon that I rubbed in butter. The topping also went together well, and again, no issues spreading. I just didn't think they tasted that good. My main issue was too much peanut butter in the topping. If I did them again, I'd leave the PB out

This is a fantastic recipe!! I'm just looking for opportunities to make them at this point, they are SO good! I didn't find this recipe to be super quick to make, but it isn't a lot of work either. Tastes like a candy bar. Has peanut butter in it, which always makes me leery because I'm not big on that (can't stand those Reeses candies). But though the PB can be tasted in this recipe, it isn't that strong.   They are very different chilled versus room temp. Room temp they are very soft and will melt somewhat in your fingers, and will also melt in your mouth. Chilled, they are real chewy and won't melt as fast. I love them either way, have a hard time deciding what's better. I would chill a few hours before cutting, though. 	 I'm going to make these twice next week, for two different groups of people. I'm not expecting to take any home, they disappear so fast, which means I'm going to have to make some for ourselves again as well.

The topping reminds me of Reese's candy.  My 3 daughters (ages 14, 12 and 7) LOVE this dessert!!!  We call it Reese's Marshmallows because that is what it reminds us of.

These are easy to make and tasty. The rice cereal adds a nice texture to the bar. It's a great recipe if your looking for something quick that will satisfy a crowd.

This went over really well at our last family gathering.  I added some extra chocolate chips to the cake portion when I made it.  Next time, I think I will make less of the bottom cake layer.

These were very good.  A great way to use marshmallows that have passed their prime.  My only problem was that my Baker's Secret pan 'warped' while cooking so one corner got thin, the rest was great.  Any suggestions as to why it did that?  Thanks for the recipe.

My kids and I loved the taste of these bars, but I baked mine in a 14" x 10" pan, and I think that was too small.  The bottom layer was too thick. I didn't spread the marshmallows with a knife, I just sort of pressed them into the cake as another reviewer suggested. Will probably make again with the right size pan!  Very tasty, thanks for the recipe!

My whole family loved these bars! My husband took some to work at the Navy base, and the guys there loved them too.  I baked in a 9x13 but didn't find the bottom to be cakey, it was perfect. Did have to bake bottom for longer. Only thing I changed was I didn't have enough choc chips, so I used 1/3 C  choc chips, and 2/3 cup Nutella.  This was delicious and I think made the top layer more creamy which we loved. Thanks for the recipe!

Kids especially love these gooey bars, and they are always a hit at gatherings.  Rather than measure out the mini marshmallows, I add enough of them to make an even layer so the topping is easier to spread over them.  (The marshmallows will swell together a little when returned to the oven.)

The brownie needed just a little bit more sugar. The topping was delicious, though. Loved the peanut butter and chocolate topping.

YUMMY!!!  I was't sure how the bottom layer was going to turn out because it looked undercooked...but it all came together in the end!  I love the differing textures!

Very good! My marshmallows were 'peeling' away from the cake part when I melted them and tried to spread it so I just poured the melted chocolate on top and swirled it around. Worked out fine.

I absolutely loved these bars, five star hands down. I made these for my family and I loved how the RICE CRISPIES gave the bars a nice little crunch, but my family had said that they would've definitely like to have the CRISPIES left out. They said it was like biting into a nice creamy bar but then hitting something stale. But they still thought they were awesome, great job!!!!

I also used brownie mix for the base. Next time I will up the chocolate to peanut butter ratio for the topping. Love the crunch from the rice cereal!

I used a boxed cake mix instead, it works great, very moist.  Had a hard time with the marshmallow spreading, will try a buttered knife next time, I used a spatula sprayed with pam, didn't work that great, but the topping does cover it so who really cares if it looks even.

These bars taste good (really rich), but mine definitely don't look like the picture.  Too much marshmallow and the top layer was really hard to spread.

I made these from the guys at work and they LOVED them!!  Big success!  I used walnuts and i didnt even bother trying to spread the melted marshmallows over the cake.  Once you pour the chocolate topping over the melted marshmallows it really doesnt need anything else.

Loved these! brought to a cookie swap, but I liked these the best of everything there! Just don't forget to let marshmallow topping COOL (I put in the fridge for a bit), then I 'patted' the marshmallows down with a spatula sprayed with nonstick spray.

I was looking for a new holiday cookie recipe for a "swap".  I was hesitant by reviews but tried anyway.  My kids wouldn't touch them.  And, they love anything chocolate, peanut butter or marshmallow.  I've never reviewed a recipe before but this was so bad it ended up in the trash and I felt compelled to write a review.

I was a bit wary of this recipe - sounded like more work than I wanted to put in that day - but I am SO glad I did.  It was no work at all.  These are easy, quick (except for cooling times), and delicious.

My family are all enormous fans of this recipe and we will make it again soon.

Thank you for sharing your family treat!

These are delicious. I stirred some chocolate chips into the batter before baking and left out the nuts. For the topping I left out the peanut butter and replaced it with andes mint chips. Very good this way!

Big fan of anything chocolate with marshmallows!  This was really good.  I didn't use peanut butter though and just doubled the chocolate and cereal since my mom isn't a fan of PB.  The cake bottom was a little bland but wasn't bad.  Maybe I used the wrong cocoa!  Will try again though.

Love this recipe. Tasted it at a church function and it was AWESOME. I make it for my coworkers and they eat a whole tray in 10 minutes!

One bad thing is that it really doesn't take 45 minutes, takes more like an hour and lots of dirty dishes. It IS worth it though. Sweet, yet not too sweet. Perfect dish for any get-together.

brought these to work and got mixed reviews. Personally, i liked the marshmallow and cocolate parts and found them relatively easy to make. It's the bottom layer that i didn't care for. I thought it was too dense and rather dry. I think these would be great if made with a graham cracker crust bottom.

I don't know if I did something wrong, like maybe beat the dough/bottom part too long, but we did not like ours at all. Okay, we liked the marshmallow and crisp cereal coated in chocolate part. So we picked that off the crust and ate it. Probably won't try again... =( Sad, cuz I love chocolate and marshmallows!

I think I should have gone with the minimum baking time on this recipe b/c the bottom of these seemed a little dry. I had something similar at a party and the bottom part was moister and thicker and the topping was also thicker. Maybe that person made them in a 9x13 pan, so I may try to do that.  People still liked them, though, so four stars!

It was good, very sweet thought. Makes alot and freezes easily. I didn't spred the marshmallows and it still turned out great. Next time I will make half the recipe and try peanuts instead of the rice crispies.

I thought these were great! I loved the brownie-cake like crust that was moist and sweet. The chocolate crispy topping was so yummy, and had just a slight tast of peanut butter, not overwhelming. And the marshmallow layer was a perfect addition. I didn't change a thing! Thanks!

This recipe was disappointing.  The different textures was very unpleasing.  A very bland dessert  that is not worth the time it took to put it together.

I went to a Christmas cookie party and took this recipe. It was a GREAT hit. I am a huge marshmallow fan so I knew I would have to make them! Will definitly make again.

I would go for 4 1/2 stars on this recipe. Shared with co workers and they
ate more than one bar at a time. Nothing left on plate within couple of hours.

I agree the cake on the bottom is a little odd, they still taste good. I used too small of a pan and they were thick so there was too much cake.  I would use a larger pan next time or reduce the amount of cake mixture and more of the middle of top layers.

WOW! These are awesome. A huge hit with everyone in my family - even my husband who's not a big chocolate fan. I made it without nuts and thought they were perfect!

I made these last night, along with three other types of cookies, and my husband said these were his favorite!  I used reduced-fat peanut butter because it's what I happened to have on hand at the time.  It worked fine, but I would imagine that the full-fat version would melt a bit easier and spread better.

I though this was just ok. The cake layer was kind of bland and needed more chocolate. I may have overcooked it since my oven runs hot and I left  it in for 15min. These were easy to make and looked great. I also think I would have liked them better without the peanut butter and a more intense choolate flavor. Also these are very sweet so make sure you audience has a very sweet tooth.

My family and friends love these. I make them for pot lucks all the time and they are always gone. The only thing is I leave out the nuts in the cake batter. YUM!
