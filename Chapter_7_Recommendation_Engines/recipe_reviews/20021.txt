This is my recipe, I now use 1 pound of bacon, crumbled, a bag of frozen baby broccoli florets (no need to defrost), and 2-4 cups of cheese, the rest of the recipe is the same, it makes it better. I am so glad you like it, it is so easy and fool proof.  Thank You

I made this for Christmas breakfast, and it was a hit.  I did make a few changes after reading other reviews.  I cut the bread into cubes before lining the bottom of pan.  Substituted about 12oz of sausage for broccoli, and added some diced ham. I cheated and used the "real bacon pieces" instead of frying and crumbling my own. Put all together the night before and popped into the oven in the morning.  It was perfect!  Thank you for this great recipe!

This recipe moved from 4 to 5 stars following Linda K's recommedations to boost the bacon and cheese.  With the second preparation of this recipe, I layered the bread with broccoli first, then bacon, and finally the cheese.  This seemed to hold the ingredients in place and the broccoli did not "crisp" and dry out.  Excellent reheated the next day.

The first time I made this recipe, I liked the make-ahead convenience, but to be honest, the taste was very bland.  Also, I couldn't fit 8 slices of bread into a 9x13 pan without overlapping them (I'm surprised no one else mentioned this).  So I modified the recipe as follows.  I reduced the bread to 6 slices (even with only 6, they still went up the sides of the pan a little) - soft breads are good because they absorb the egg mixture and bake up nice and fluffy (I used a soft, fresh whole-wheat bread).  Then I greatly increased the cheese and meat (to 2 cups and 24 oz., respectively) and reduced the eggs to 8, because I prefer a less "eggy" taste.  I also used Dijon mustard (instead of dry mustard) and upped it to about 1/4 cup.  After these modifications, the result was much more satisfying and flavorful, in my opinion.  The generous measure of bacon, plus the added plenty of flavor to make your taste buds say "Wow!"  You could also use ham - anything that is very flavorful - just be sure to use plenty.  Normally I'm not a big meat or cheese eater, but in this recipe, you really need it or the casserole is very blah.  The original measurement of meat (8 ounces) just got overwhelmed by all the eggs and bread - I couldn't even taste it.  Increasing the meat, cheese, and mustard and reducing the eggs and bread made it much better.

This is a great casserole! I added 1/2 t. onion and 1/8 t. garlic powder and increased the dry mustard powder 1/2 t.  and also substituted frozen hashbrowns for the broccoli (for my picky husband) and increased the cheese by about a cup or so. It turned out fantastic! I wasn't sure about putting the bread slices in whole- my other strata recipes have you rip the bread into pieces- but it turned out great and was one less step! I also cooked the bacon in the microwave which makes it even easier! It's also very kid friendly- my 3 year old daughter has been asking when we can have it again. Great recipe- thanks!

This got so many good reviews that I thought it would be a sure thing, but I'm sorry we just did not enjoy this at all.  Made this because I was cooking for a crowd and it did make a lot.  The bread made the texture of the dish spongy, the bacon got soggy, the cheese burned, it tasted pretty bland, and hubby said the "the broccoli doesn't go."  Just overall was not received well by anyone.  I would have been better off making scramble or breakfast burritos.  Who knows maybe it was the cook that was at fault?  I will say that I followed the recipe to the tee though.

Very good dish. I used french bread and only put broccoli on half of it, as per my children. I added chopped onions to the whole thing. When I pulled it out of the refrigerator in the morning, I had my doubts. It looked like a mess. But after baking it, we all changed our minds. It was delicious!!! Even my 13 year old son liked it. And that's something. Very good and easy. I recommend it to everyone.

Very easy basic breakfast casserole!  You can modify this based on your family's tastes.  I used half breakfast sausage and half bacon along with the broccoli.  I also used more cheese than was called for.  I made this and just baked it right away instead of refrigerating overnight.  I did find that flattening everything down with a spatula before baking helped to soak all the egg mixture in with the bread. Maybe not the fanciest dish ever, but definitely good.  I served this with fruit salad for dinner.  Easy and economical!

I made this the night before for a brunch and it turned out delicious!  I used only six slices of bread, because they all didn't fit.  I broke up the bread pieces to fit the dish and added a bit more butter to the slices.  It was very good and the bread was fluffy!  I would make this again.

Nice quick supper.  I made it in the morning before work and let it sit in the fridge all day instead of overnight.  Lovely presentation and mild taste.  I will use more bacon next time, chopped broccoli instead of florets, and maybe a titch more seasoning in the eggs.  That little bit of mustard wasn't enough.  Thinking of dill ...

This was a great base recipe.  I did make changes based on other reviews.  Instead of broccoli I added fresh spinach and also cooked onions and mushrooms with the sausage.  I cooked about 6 slices of bacon and added it to the mix.  I used 2 cups of cheese.  It turned out great.  Reheated well the next morning, too.  Definitely recommend this.  I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't stay completely true to the original recipe.

I made this for our Sunday family breakfast before church.  It was so easy to just put it in the oven in the morning.  I made it the night before.  It was beautiful, tasted amazing, and the texture was fantastic.  Everyone loved it and had seconds. I had to modify the recipe slightly. I didn't have any brocoli, so I used chopped spinach instead. I also added 1/2 cup chopped onions (my family is into onions).  It was perfect.  I will definately make this again!  I served this with a fresh fruit salad and fresh streusel topped blueberry muffins from this site. It was all a hit!

We liked this, but definitely want to make some changes. Maybe some green onion and bell pepper. The idea is good, and the dish is easy, but it was just a bit bland for us. I'll certainly make it again, but with a few changes.

This was a great Christmas morning casserole!  My stuffy mother-in-law (who stares at me as if I had antlers growing out of my head) commented on how good it was (first time..EVER).  I did use sausage instead of the broccoli, but only because I was trying to please them.  Thanks for sharing Linda!

Great Casserole!  Used spicy sausage instead of bacon and doubled the amount to 16 oz.  Also cut the eggs down to 9.  Served with hot syrup.

This was great.  I tested 3 recipes for breakfast casseroles on the family this weekend and this one was far above the rest.  I will be making this for a teacher appreciation breakfast tomorrow.  I did as previous reviewers said & added some more cheese and used frozen broccoli (16oz bag). Since I had the other casserole ingredients going, I had some extra cooked potato & threw that in too.  I forgot to put in the dried mustard, but didn't miss it. This was really good & so easy.  Thank you Linda!

made this for birthday breakfast....excellent!  All I changed was 1 cup half n half and 1 cup fat free milk ( thats all we use).  I also sprinkled hash browns on top and took off cover 20 minutes to brown them.  Oh, also only used 11 eggs  ( thats what I had).  Still turned out perfect.  Thanks soo much!

This was awesome. I substituted cherry tomatoes for the broccoli, as I am not a big fan of it baked. I also used a swiss cheese. My out of town guests raved non-stop and asked for the recipe! Thanks.

This was really good.  I added garlic salt rather than regular salt and used sausage and bacon.  My husband and daughter won't eat broccoli, so I didn't try.  I made first thing in the morning and did not let sit over night.  It tasted a lot like a stratta.  The bread got really fluffy.  I will make again.

This was really tasty. I did make a few modifications based upon what was in the fridge. I used turkey pepperoni instead of bacon, low fat mexican cheese blend and skim milk. I let it sit overnite in the fridge and baked it the next morning. 

I liked how this recipe can be altered so many different ways.. different meat, different cheeses and I bet even other veggies would work well with this good basic recipe. This will be kept in my recipe box.

Had all 5 sisters, spouses, nieces and nephews over for brunch on a birthday. These were great, went together easily, changed the ingredients around. Used frozen broccoli florets, thawed them with hot water ran over them, used crumbled pre-cooked bacon. It was a hit!!!

What a pleasant surprise! Usually these sorts of dishes are too greasy & heavy but this one (despite the cheese and bacon) was surprisingly light and flavorful. Definitely a great potluck or brunch dish (make ahead and reheat)!

I realy enjoyed this meal.  I did make some changes to make it healthier.  I used three cups of egg whites which is the equivelent to 12 eggs.  I also, used 6 pieces of bread instead of 8.  I used low fat chedder cheese. And I added some onion and green peppers.  I thought it was delicious and it makes the meal alot healthier.

This was a great, easy and tasty recipe.  I used Gruyere cheese instead of cheddar, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and added some caramelized shallots for extra flavor.  I also added about 1/2 cup of mayo to the egg mixture.  Certainly not low in fat or calories but worth it for the taste and texture.  I brought it to a brunch and everyone raved.

I thought this was a great recipe, but my husband thought I used too much bread. The bread we buy is more of the upscale whole grain type, which is bigger than plain white sandwich bread, so 8 slices more more than covered the bottom of the pan. In order to make it even, I used more like 10 slices, which made 2 layers of bread instead of a single layer lining the bottom. No one else complained (I served it to friends for brunch) but my husband says he didn't love it. We also substituted lean cubed ham for the bacon. I thought the whole thing was great, but next time I will use closer to 6 slices of bread and make sure I only have one layer on the bottom of the pan.

Yummy!  This turned out just how I'd hoped.  I shortened the prep time by using the microwave for the bacon and also to steam the broccoli.  I simply rinsed the broccoli and put it in a corning ware dish with a lid and used only what water remained on the broccoli to steam it for 4 mins.  I added a finely minced onion to the egg mixture.  I did NOT make it ahead of time; it sat in the fridge for an hour before I put it in the oven.  It was great!

Tried this just to have something different for Sunday breakfast.  I skipped the dry mustard, used packaged ham and added garlic.  Company dropped in and just loved it!  Will definitely make this again.

Really liked this recipe--had some vegetarian guests so we substituted chopped spinach for the bacon and added sauteed mushrooms.  The casserole was a hit!

Easy! I have really thin, disappointing bread because we are on a diet.  I don't know if I would bother with it next time or might be worth a trip for real bread!!  Used egg sub. and worked fine.  Used frozen broccoli which added to the cook time because the water from it made it runny.  Turned out fine!  Next time will either defrost or plan on baking longer. Big crowd pleaser, made a ton, everyone was satisfied.  Will try with asparagus as well. Thanks for a good one!

great easy recipe. I made it a day ahead of time & kept it in the fridge & cooked it for New Years brunch...so many compliments. It baked up perfectly. I did make my own arrangement by adding mushrooms & spinach.

My fiance and i loved this! I halved the recipe but added one extra egg and alittle milk, so 7 total. I didnt have any meat at home so I used broccoli and mushrooms and only had american cheese in the fridge so I broke that up and used that. Followed others reviews and cubed the bread and layered with broccoli, mushrooms, cheese, then eggs. It was delicious! Definitely worth the hour wait in the fridge! Yum!

I made this when my daughter and her family came for the weekend.  Easy way to feed a bunch of people breakfast/brunch.  I made as directed with one substitution.  Used frozen hash browns w/ pepper and onion instead of broccoli.  Everyone liked it and happily ate the leftovers the next day!

I made this with turkey bacon, and added some left-over garlic french fries, cut down to one inch pieces. I buttered the bread with olive spread rather than butter. But I did butter the pan. What a wonderful tasty way to add broccoli to the diet. Served mine for dinner. Yumm!

This was really good. I had to sub swiss cheese and a dijon mustard, but that's what I think is great about this recipe, it's easy to adapt to whatever you have on hand. I cut a few slices of a whole wheat batard, tore the slices into pieces, and then mixed all the ingredients in a bowl. I also cut the recipe in 1/2 so I only baked 40 min. Will definitely make again.

UPDATE 11/19/11:  Made a pretrial run of this dish before making it for Thanksgiving.  Came out way too bready.  Thinking about lining pan with pillsbury pie crust dough or the pillsbury crescent roll dough.

Previous Post:  I have made a similar recipe in the past and it is so nice to make ahead of time and just pop in the oven.  I'm making this for Thanksgiving but using spinich instead of brocolli, adding diced onion, diced tomatoes, the bacon (I usually use beef sausage link cut up, but this time I HAVE bacon) and the cheese.  It's an easy recipe that you can put anything in (asparagus) and it will come out great.  I'm not sure about 2 cups of milk; might cut that down to 3/4 or 1 cup. Cube the bread before lining the pan, or just throw cubes in the egg mixture and pour it all in the greased baking dish.

Simple and good.  The only change I made was recommended by others:  layer brocc, then bacon and finally cheese.  Browned beautifully and tasted great.

Try substituting Morning Star vegetarian sausage for the bacon-healthier and very flavorful! You can also use half eggs, half egg whites and add more veggies!

Great but broccoli is not a breakfast food. I used 8 oz of sausage instead of bacon so it would be meatier. Try adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and a dash or 2 of either hot sauce or cayenne pepper. I also broke the bread in pieces which seems to work better. I liked the idea of combining pepper jack and cheddar cheeses and it tasted really good. Took 2 large pans to a ladies retreat and both were gone in a jiffy!  I used low carb bread (4 slices torn up covered the bottom of pan) for my family who are continually on a low carb diet!

I made this recipe for an early morning tailgate before a football game.  It was a huge hit.  I used 1/2 the amount of sausage (hot & spicy) and used pepper jack cheese for a little kick.  Wow! It was so easy, especially since I made it the night before and just popped in it in the oven the next morning.  I will make this again over the holidays!

Oh, YUM!!  This was excellent.  I loved the bread-lined bottom (which turns out kind of fluffy) and I did substitute sausage for the broccoli.  Everyone LOVED it at Easter breakfast.

I thought this was good but kind of bland. After I put some salt and peppper on my serviing it was delicious. Next time I would add some spicier cheese and maybe some onions. I added some fresh spinach. It's a keeper.

We doubled the bacon and broccoli. It turned out really well for Christmas breakfast. It's nice to be able to get it ready the day before and just pop it into the oven before all the Christmas morning festivities.

Love this recipe. Great church brunch dish.  You can make it with or without the bread.  Easy to put together.  Great with asparagus. Wonderful leftover.

This was a tasty, savory way to use up old bread. I cut the bread into chunks, and skipped the butter. I used vegetarian hot dogs instead of bacon and was more generous with both the "meat" and the broccoli. It was a good dish, but a bit bland. I think next time I'd brown some onion and garlic with the hot dogs or add more seasoning.

Loved this recipe!  It was easy and delicious.  We travel most weekends to our little cabin in the woods.  We don't have running water in the winter, so I'll make this before the night before we leave so we don't have to dirty pots & pans for the weekend.  Will make again and again!

Very good.  Used 6 slices of bread because 8 won't fit.  Lots of extra cheese.  Eliminated broccoli and used 1 package of sausage.

Great recipe Linda! I used sausage instead of bacon and I only used 10 eggs. I wouldn't dream of making this without the broccoli ~ it makes the casserole! Yummy.

This was a very easy recipe to make.  I made it about 4 hours ahead of time and then just popped it in the oven.  I found the time and ingriedent measurements to be right on.  I will be making it again but I think I will add some sauted onions and peppers to give it just a little more kick!

First, I chose this recipe because it had bacon, not sausage, which my children prefer for a Christmas morning casserole. Second, I made it exactly according to the recipe with the added cheese and bacon.  Finally...It was a hit!!!!  Everyone ate it up!  It was so easy since I put it together the night before.  The only thing I might change is I may leave out the broccoli next time.  I'm not a huge fan of it.  This is a keeper!

Great recipe to make ahead.  I left out the broccoli, replaced bread with croutons. For bacon, I used packaged real bacon bits to save prep time. Easy and good!

I would prefer this without the bread and maybe used croissant dough instead. Used turkey sausage instead of bacon and added green peppers and onion.  More cheese will be added next time.

I made this recipe for New Years Day Brunch!! It was a hit!! I used a 1/2 loaf of sliced day old French Bread which I think gave it more texture.  If anything I would add 4-6 more eggs due to my hearty bread choice.  I highly recommend this dish, especially for early morning gatherings.

This is a very tasty recipe. I served it for easter brunch. It was a big hit! I will make it again. I used less bacon and added a little more cheese. I also added onions for more flavor. I prepaired the night before for an easy brunch that everyone loved.

Very good! I did the "bake immediately" step instead of the overnight thing and it turned out good. I used cooked/cubed ham and the broccoli (for us) is a must. VERY GOOD! I was worried the bread would get mushy but it baked w/ the rest beautifully!

The taste was very bland. I added some garlic, 1/2 cup of cooked onion, tablespoon of Dijon mustard, and used sharp cheddar cheese but it was still pretty bland. I will try it again, but use sausage instead of bacon , and more spices.  I liked that you can make it the night before as that makes the morning easy.  I think the substitution of spinach for broccoli, Swiss instead of cheddar  and added mushrooms recommended by someone else would be a nice improvement.

I substituted frozen hash browns for the broccoli and cubed the buttered bread, per some of the other reviews.  It was yummy!

Excellent recipe! Followed basic instructions but did the following: used1tsp salt and 1  tsp pepper plus a little bit of onion. Used 8 slices of Texas Toast bread. Melted 1/4 c of butter and coated bottom of casserole dish with it.instead of layering the bread in the bottom of the casserole I cubed it and tossed it with the egg/cheese mixture. Baked it for 45 minutes uncovered and then covered casserole with foil to prevent browning.

Was a very easy dish to make - just added a little ham, added a package of frozen spinach (thawed and well drained).  Also took advice of others, and cubed the bread after buttering it.

I added bacon and extra cheese like many suggested.  Kept the egg count where directed.    Be careful to use small breadcrumb chunks if you sub this in - large ones did not absorb the flavor as well.Was a huge hit!

Turned out very good! I added quite a bit more cheese, bacon and broccoli and stuck to the recipe except for adding 2 more eggs since there was so much other stuff in it. It required about 15 minutes longer bake time this way. Tasty!

Delicious. To make it a little healthier, I used Whole foods sage/chicken sausage instead of bacon and 6 eggs and 6 egg whites. I also added a layer of chopped sauteed red onions on top of the cheese layer. I may add mushrooms next time.

Really enjoyed this.  I didn't have broccoli so I made it with Spinach.  Also, added additional ingredients per other reviews:  garlic powder, dried onions, and doubled the dry mustard.  Everyone loved it!

Wonderful! Took to family gathering - Gone with compliments! Few changes, used 10 thin slices french bread, substituted sauteed green onions and fresh mushrooms for bacon, sprinkling them over steamed broccoli. (10 min. was perfect). Substituted 1 3/4 c almond milk, plus 1/3 c sour cream for milk. Several compliments plus "beautiful" when came out of oven in 55 min. Definitely do again!

I really liked the brocolli addition.
I used wheat bread and the variety I used would only allow almost 6 slices.
Maybe less eggs and more cheese next time.
Now my favorite breakfast casseroles.

Very yummy.  Didn't use the broccoli--instead used maple sausage--would cut down a little on that the next time though.  Will add some onions and gr. peppers next time for a little "zip!"  Will definitely make again!!!
