Hubby is a gourmet cook -- so I hardley ever cook! I tried this last nite as a lark & when he pulled into the driveway he was swept away w/the aroma (I was just doing the braising at the time)
Turns out this meal was a hit & coming from him that means a LOT!!!
The recipe was easy to follow...I was missing cayenne pepper & substituted hot peppers (for pizza topping) in its place w/ a 1/4 teaspoon horseradish. Misread the directions & instead of 8 pepper rings --I added 8 small sweet peppers( red or & yel) Had some extra fresh mushrooms & decided to add that as well! Served over jasmine rice w/real curry seasoning.

I can't wait to do this for company -- especially seeing as they know I normally don't cook! This meal was *ono*!! 
Aloha,
JS

Very tasty!  Spicy and not too popular with my younger kids but teens and adults couldn't get enough.

Very good but lacking something.  Like another reviewer, I may try adding something (lime juice or more vinegar) next time.  Also try upping the spices.  I served it with fried platanos and brown rice- maybe next time I'll cook my rice in chicken stock instead of water to add more flavor to the whole dish.  Loved the creamy, subtle flavor or the coconut milk though!

This recipe was quick and easy to make. The red pepper rings contrasted with the yellow sauce make it visually appealing as well. A must try!

This recipe was easy to make and we gave it a verdict of "ok". The flavors weren't quite bold enough for us, perhaps marinating the chicken a while with the initial rub would help. That said, we did enjoy it, but would want to make a big change before trying it again. Maybe adding lime juice or lemon grass...

We didn't personally care for this recipe. I don't necessarily think it was the recipe itself. I just don't think we cared for the flavors too much.

I had been wanting to try something with coconut milk for months and I found I didn't like it. O well - 

The recipe was easy and quick though.

I made two changes which really boosted the flavor.  First, instead of the spice rub, I used canned Thai masaman curry paste (about 1/2 of a 4 oz. can for reasonably spicy-hot, less if you want a milder taste); this is available in the Asian section of the supermarket, costs about $0.75.  Second, I used regular (not low-fat) coconut milk.  Enjoy!

I made this exactly per the recipe.  Flavor was way too subtle for this family, and I won't be making it again.
