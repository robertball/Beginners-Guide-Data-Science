Great side dish - the tarragon provided a very differnt flavor. I used a steam in bag of carrots and just added some lemon zest and the rest of the ingredients.

A tasty way to dress up carrots!  I did these in the microwave in my 4c measure (7 min), skipped the lemon peel (didn't have it), substituted marjoram for tarragon, and added more honey at the end.  I was worried about the seasonings, but they weren't overwhelming and added a nice savory flavor.

I really liked these. I just steamed baby carrots & then heated them up with the rest of the ingred. Very tasty. I subbed Herbes de Provence for the Tarragon. Thanks!

Really delicious, light flavor. I did add a teaspoon or so of honey to the lemon and seasoning mixture to sweeten it a bit.
