I might be being nice by giving this recipe four stars. It was fine, and we gobbled it down, but it really reminded me of hamburger helper. Not a fancy end for some excellent chorizo. We used half the bechamel, which I flavored with 1/2 t paprika and 1 T parsley. I think it also could have used more chorizo. Whole wheat noodles hold up well in this recipe.

Well...I blew it.  I didn't have any bell peppers or diced tomatoes, but I did have a can of Italian diced tomatoes and added the drained can to the white sauce.  I followed the recipe otherwise.  VERY good!!  Hubby loved it.  Thanks!

This was simple to put together and yummy!  I used fresh from the garden tomatoes instead of canned, and added a bit of cumin and red pepper flakes.  It was a good way to use up some chorizo.  I will definitely make it again.

We liked this.  I followed the recipe except for I did not use all chorizo sausage, I was afraid that would be too much for my family.  Instead I used 1/4 chorizo and the balance in Italian pork sausage.  It was a nice mix.  This was a nice quick and easy meal for a week night.  We will make this again.

Love it, of course I did my own thing with it but the inspiration is there! I used a vegetarian chorizo, added some cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, tomato paste instead of the milk, little sugar to cut the canned tomato taste  . And it turns into a super spicy dish!

Very delish no problems I added some mixed veggies for some color and to make it a bit healthier. I also used fat free milk and low fat butter spread

I had to alter this a little as I went along.  First, we use ground chorizo in our house so I browned that up instead of using the slices, so the outcome was textured like a meatsauce and spicy throughout.  The tomatoes I used were fire roasted, which added a great flavor to the sauce.  I only used about half the milk because the sauce would've been too thin for my liking with more.  For the cheese, used taco blend, not Parmesan.  Hubby thought the final outcome was 5* delish but since I fixed it up a bit and didn't like it THAT much, I'll rate it 4* overall.

It was okay, nothing more. I added some chili powder to my plate to give it some flavor. Its just tomato bisque with chorizo added. I doubt if I will make it again.

Was given 3 long chorizo links and didn't know what to do with them. Found this recipe and had all but green peppers on hand. Followed the directions exactly aside from the pepper and used a different shape pasta. Found it to be slightly bland but added a little more salt, garlic, and pepper and that was enough to improve it to my liking. My family  enjoyed it. Hubby went back for seconds and 7 yo son ate it too. I'm looking forward to leftovers. Easy enough and yummy enough. Will make again.

Okay, so we customized this recipe a little bit. Cooked a cubed, med.-sized chicken breast in with the bulk-style (no links) chorizo we had, since it just seemed like it needed more protein to offset all that pasta, with the 1T butter.  Didn't have a green pepper, so diced 1 yellow and 1 red pepper and added that with the chopped onion to the meat when almost done.  When the veggies started to soften, added the 2T butter, about 1/2t oregano, a little basil, and the pepper, then the 2T flour and let it cook for a few minutes. Stirred in a 14.5 oz can of fire-roasted tomatos, then a 12oz can of evap milk.  Simmered it 10 minutes and stirred in the cooked pasta.  Topped each bowl with a mexican-blend shredded cheese.  YUM.

Very good meal. I added about a cup of mozzarella cheese into the sauce while it was cooking. We enjoyed it and shared with some neighbors as well. They loved it.

Made this for my family this evening. We all enjoyed it. My only variables where we do not like onion so I didn't use that.I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes. I also added queso cheese along with the Parmesan cheese. As we are big cheese eaters. I also added chili powder via another review. It was a great addition!! Super tastey dinner for a cold night !! Thanks for the recipe!!  :-D

Tasted pretty good, like my food with a spicy flavor. First time trying this rec. I only used about 12 ounces of choriza, good flavor.
