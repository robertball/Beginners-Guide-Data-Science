I love homemade butter.  I was surprised this recipe did not give any hints for what to do after your done blending -  make sure you rinse the buttermilk out of the butter with cold running water, pushing the liquid out with a spatula.  Salt should be added after the rinsing.  Also, your cream and supplies should be very cold at all times for a good smooth consistency.  Use at least 30% milk fat cream.

I would give this ten stars if I could!  It was sooooo easy, and probably cheaper than buying butter.  I had a little carton of heavy cream sitting in my refrigerator, so I decided to see if it would work for me.  You can tell it's ready when it goes from being perfectly white and smooth to being yellow with lots of little chunks (like cottage cheese), and there's milk in the food processor.  I didn't bother straining it or squishing it with a spoon, I just dumped it all into a bowl and picked up the curds and squeezed the milk out of it with my hands.  The milk tastes good, too!  And remember you can do just about anything with it, add whatever seasonings and herbs you like and even a little bit of fruit for yummy strawberry butter or whatever.

This is for Sunny.  There are butter presses made to press the excess water out of home-churned butter, but I'm not sure if they're worth the expense.  We just take a flat spatula/pancake turner and press out the water.  My grandmother (born 1906) actually had to churn the family butter and she taught us to use a spatula.  Whatever you use, this is fantastic!  I don't add the salt because I always buy unsalted store-bought butter.

Homemade butter really is this easy - you can use any electric mixer or even an egg beater if you want to build some muscles.  I put the lump of butter in a cheesecloth/muslin then squeeze out the excess buttermilk.

I just finished making this, and let me tell ya, I will not buy real butter at the store anymore!!! I followed the recipe except I didn't have a food processor so I used my Kitchen Aid mixer on speed 8 for about 5-8 minutes...it worked perfectly. I just squeezed the buttermilk out with my hands, it was messy, but didn't take long at all! I will definately be making this over & over & over, well you get the point! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This recipe is cheaper than buying butter if you pour off the liquid and set it to the side to make your own buttermilk...rinse butter as some have stated to keep it from going rancid..the reserved liquid should be measured  and put into a jar or container.. add 3 parts  regular milk to 1 part reserved liquid and set it on your counter for 24 hours and  then refrigerate your  fresh made BUTTERMILK!

Wow, pretty darn amazing to watch the transformation! This was my first attempt at making butter and I was kind of surprised that it actually worked! Once done, I rinsed the butter several times and used cheese cloth to strain out the buttermilk. I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixter with the whisk attachment. Also decided to add herbs and spices which I think will be wonderful on Italian bread. Thanks so much Brian!!

We churn butter for holiday dinners using my grandmother's Daisy churn. We have learned along the way.  Thoroughly rinsing your butter will make it last longer -- otherwise it gets an off/sour taste.  We put our butter in a wide, shallow bowl, pour ice water on it, work the ice water through with a wooden flat spatula and then drain.  We continue that process until the drained water is clear.  At that point, we work in our salt using the spatula.  If you oversalt the butter, just use cold water to rinse until sufficient salt is removed.

This is a great recipe! I got 1/2 gallon of heavy cream from a neighborhood store for $2.99! (I may go buy the rest of his stock before he realizes he could charge a lot more). I ended up with 2 1/4lbs of butter! Easy, if a little messy. I did find it a little difficult to get all of the liquid out of the butter - would appreciate tips on making this easier. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I had some heavy whipping cream that expired today so I thought I would try it. It was so neat watching the changes - When it was ready I put it in a strainer for a bit - then used paper towels to soak up the rest of the liquid. It turned out Great - Thank you for posting this recipe

Way more stars if it were allowed! When I think of all the money I have wasted buying butter . . . when I could have been making it myself. I used organic heavy cream & this was so easy & super delicious! I am going to make it next time with my kids so they can see the process.

This was so much fun to make.  I used my KitchenAid mixer and it was very easy.  Once it hits the whipped cream stage, keep going- you're almost there.  I used a lot of cream so I could make several different compound butters.  I made salted and unsalted butter, cinnamon honey butter, and a garlic and herb butter.  All are delicious!  I squeezed the butter using cheesecloth.  The leftover buttermilk is in the fridge right now- tomorrow I'll use it to make homemade waffles with cinnamon-butter and homemade coconut syrup.  YUM!

This was not only fun to make but delicious too!  I made in my KA but it took 20 minutes and not 10.  I wrapped some towels around the bowl as it began to splatter when the liquid separated.  I drained some liquid off (saved it to make bread with) and continued beating until no more liquid came out.  We had some on the Bread Machine Bagels recipe from this site.  Simply delicious!***UPDATE***  I find that wrapping the bowl in plastic wrap much better than towels!  You can also see through it  which is fun for the kids and easy clean up for me! . ****update*** I no longer buy butter.  This is too good tasting and easy to whip up!

I think its important to note that the cream should be room temp before starting.  It coagulates much more quickly that way.  This may require that it set out for a few hours beforehand.

I would have given 5 if this included more tips---you gather your butter and squeeze the liquid then put and rinse thru cheesecloth. until water is clear. The Reason for this is the butter will last longer. The liquid is buttermilk and can be saved for pancakes, cornbread, etc.  I use organic raw fresh from dairy cream, and even my husband converted to butter after we married. There is no comparison for taste. Tip you can freeze your butter (I have frozen pnds all the time), then take it out a few days before you need it. Enjoy

I have made butter before and the best way to rid of the buttermilk is place the butter in a piece of cheese cloth and squeeze it out.  Then put the butter back into the blender or food processor, add some ice cold water and give it another whirl or two then squeeze the water out, this way it will stay fresh longer.

I gotta try this again.....because I did something wrong.  I used a blender -and all it did was get foamy? 2/3/09 - I received a kitchenaid mixer for my birthday and wanted to revisit this recipe. I'M SO GLAD I DID!!!  I used the kitchenaid on speed 8, used the whisk tool.  I stopped it a couple times trying to figure out when it was done.....its done when: it goes from whipped cream consistency to whipped cream gone bad and back to somewhat of a liquid form again.  Really, I panicked for a second, thinking I had done something wrong again.  Then I tipped the mixing bowl to one side and squeezed as much of the solid chunks to the side of the bowl, it resembled butter!  So then I started to squeeze it until the buttermilk was as good as gone, but the buttermilk into a measuring cup and then put cold water into the mixing bowl to rinse the butter. Squeezed some more but this time w/ my hands.  (Bonus: my hands are silky soft now!)  I put the rinsed butter onto a paper towel while I washed my hands.  Then voila! I have homemade butter!!! I did add some salt and then tasted it immediately! I'm going to make it again tomorrow w/ my kids!!!

This was not even half as easy or delicious as everyone else makes it sound. How disappointing... I'd like to try again, but I'm going to look up a more detailed set of instructions. Some of the comments suggest that a lot more labor needs to go into this than simply squeezing the buttermilk out with a spoon (which only made a mess for me).

Brian, I am a city girl, I have no need to Make my own butter except for the fact that this was SO COOL to make! Oh Wow! I grabbed a qt of heavy whipping cream, popped the mixing bowl and whip attachment in the freezer for a couple hours and started whipping the cream. Thanks to other reviews, I did wrap a bit of plastic wrap around the top of mixer. Good thing I did. cuz it gets splattery.( word?)  About 2/3 of the way through, I was wondering if I was getting the right results, Well about 3 minutes later, I had my answer. BUTTER!! I used the buttermilk to make pancakes the next morning. I rinsed the butter with water in a colander with a spoon. I divided the butter in half to make a sweet compound butter with cinnamon, nutmeg and Splenda. Which I used on the pancakes. The other half of butter, I made a  salty,smoked paprika compound that will be terrific on grilled salmon. I may never buy butter Again! Thanks Brian

As written, the recipe doesn't contain all of the information you need to make butter.  I used KA mixer with whisk attachment (since you really make whipped cream first then continue beating).  On speed setting 8 (highest speed) takes between 15-20 minutes.  Follow other's advice to either use cheese cloth to strain out excess liquid or use a strainer.  Adding salt is NOT necessary (without salt you will have unsalted butter).  Very important to compress the butter that results or it very watery, even so, you can't compress it as tightly as done when butter is processed commercially.  The result can't be used for baking since it won't measure the same as butter you buy in the store, but good for sauteeing or spreading on toast where measureing is not required.

This turned out just fantastic!  I first tried to make it in my blender, but it got to thick and creamy for the blades.  But then I tried it with my hand-held mixer, and it turned out just perfect...five stars all the way!

I've done this many times; it works like a charm and is easy to make flavored butter as well.  I use it as is, however, for those who are used to a more yellow appearance, you'll want a drop of yellow food coloring.  Most dairies are doing this -- real butter isn't really yellow.

I made butter today and yesterday was the LAST time I will ever buy butter. This was sooo easy and the butter tasted great .. btw so did the buttermilk that was strained off the butter when it was done separating. This isn't exactly a recipe it's more of a technique but it's one worth having in your head if not your recipe box.  A nice tip for this is to take some saran and wrap it around the top of your bowl connecting it to the mixer to prevent splashes when this does separate as it can get kind of messy after it separates into butter and buttermilk as the buttermilk tends to get thrown out of the bowl by the lump of butter whirling in the bottom ;)

I have never made it in a blender, but accidently came upon an easy way to make homemade butter also. I froze a carton of whipping cream(expecting that I could thaw and use at a later time) but when I thawed it out and shook it up, it turned to butter.

I feel somehow as if we've all out-Deened Ms. Paula with this one.  What's better than cooking with butter? MAKING butter.  Also, I feel so homestead-y... like maybe I need to reread Little House on the Prairie.  Uh, can you tell I've enjoyed this recipe? Right up until buttermilk splashed all OVER the place in my kitchen, but that's my fault for walking away right as the butter and liquids were about to break. LOL

Save the liquid that comes off the butter! Use it to make buttermilk pancakes or biscuits to go with your fresh butter. Delicious!

I have made sauces, pie fillings, salsas, you name it in my food processor. By far, that was the coolest thing to ever come out of my food processor!  And as a bonus - I never have to buy buttermilk again for the small amount used in german chocolate cake!  Just a tip (thanks Alton Brown!) - the salt that is optional will keep your butter from going bad.  Unsalted butter needs to be stored in foil to keep it from spoiling.

This was great and so easy!  It was so neat watching my stand mixer whisk cream into butter.  I usually do not like salted butter but this recipe needed the salt, in my opinion.  I ran my stand mixer on speed 8 for around 10 minutes and then pressed out the liquid with the back of a spoon.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Instead of putting the cream in the blender I decided to put in a mason jar with lid and I shook it for about 45 minutes. That way I didn't have to scrap the butter off the blades in the blender. I took the liquid that I strained out which was about a cup and I added a tbsp of vinegar to it and let it set at room temp. for about 15 minutes and had buttermilk and added it to my pancake mix the next day. Very good! In my opinion I didn't care to drink the buttermilk but it was a nice and cheap alternative to add buttermilk to a recipe.

So fun to make. I too had some heavy whipping cream that was at its expiration date so thought I might as well give it a try. I used my Kitchen Aide Mixer and put it on medium until it started to thicken and then put on high and let it go. It changed from cream to butter very quickly at the end. I heard the mixer slow down and heard the water splattering. Yup, it was a mess. I had buttermilk all over the cupboards/counter/appliances/etc. Next time I will try it in the food processor or blender. I had almost a full quart of cream and it made about 1 1/2 c. butter and 1 1/2 c. buttermilk. I am going to cook something with the buttermilk also. I just squeezed my butter with my hands to get out all the buttermilk and it turned out great. I will be doing this soon. FUN and MESSY but worth it.

Very simple and yummy. I have also added jack daniels to the butter to put on steaks. Honey for biscuits. Gralic for french bread. The options are endless! Thanks Brian!

This is a great recipe!  It's amazing how heavy cream goes from whipped cream to butter so quickly.  Unless you find cheap whipping cream, this may not be cost effective.  I paid $2.69 for 1 pint of store brand heavy cream.  The way I figure it, every cup of heavy cream gives you 1/4 pound of butter.  That means 1 pound is more than $5, which doesn't make sense.  If anyone can tell me where I can find reasonably priced heavy cream, I'd appreciate it.  Especially if the cream has no hormones, that would be even better.  But this is a great recipe, and if I can find cheap cream I'd rather make my own than buy it.  Thanks!

1st time making butter and it came out YUM-E!  I used my beautiful 13 cup Kitchenaid food procesor (christmas/birthday gift) with the multi-task blade and in about 5 minutes the cream had separated.  I used a small piece of cheesecloth to strain and impressed my husband. :) (:

I have been finding a lot of great home made alternatives on here for products I would normally purchase store bought, and this one hits in the top five of my favorites~ I never would have even thought of doing it if not for the 'recipe' here. One of the many reasons I love AR. It was so easy. I just used my f.p. and then pressed the butter into a cheesecloth lined sieve to extract the buttermilk (which was a pleasant bonus!).  It may or may not be economical depending on the cost of your cream versus a pound of butter, but the taste alone is worth it!

I just saw chef, Jacques Pépin make butter on Rachael Ray.  No need for fancy gadgets, after the food processor, he just placed the butter on a cloth, wrapped & gently pressed the excess liquid from the butter.  Also, the liquid left over in your food processor is buttermilk!  Nothing is wasted.

I don't know where the liquid is that everyone is talking about. I did this with a kitchen aid and I got no liquid at all. One qt of heavy cream made 6 cups of butter. That's the equivalent of 3 pounds at the store and this only cost $5

This was a great way to use up leftover whipping cream. Very easy to make.  I had ultrapasteurized cream, but I am curious about how this would work with raw cream.  The only downside was that the "buttermilk" didn't  past the Husband test, as it was bland, but that may be  because of the ultrapasteurization.

I have unleashed the wrath of the butter gods upon my poor little blender! Alas, I put heavy cream into my blender and started it up. After awhile it started thickening up to the point of being unsweetened whipped cream. I kept blending til it went all liquid again, (the liquid got very warm from friction). Then kept blending..  about 45 mins in all. Occasionally i whispered words of encouragement to it and gave it a gentle brush of my fingers here and there but I was still unable to coax even a minute amount of butter out of it. Eventually I gave up and called it a loss. I gave it 3 stars anyways cause it worked for everyone else even though it didnt work for me and im sure it was something i did. The only Heavy Cream i could get ahold of was ultra-pasteurized. Not sure if thats the problem but im using it as an excuse anyways. :)

Update: It was the use of my blender that was the problem. I got out my hand mixer and had butter in no time! Creamy, yellow, delicious butter! :)

Wow! So cool to see the transformation! I may not butter again because by making your own,you achieve two things; make your own butter AND make fresh buttermilk that's great for waffles. Both were also very delicious and since I dont like salted butter it's nice that I can make some and know that there's nothing else added into it, just smooth and silky fresh butter!

This was fun to make in my Kitchenaid.  It worked out very well.  I did do a cost comparison between making it with cream versus buying packaged butter.  It cost me $2 for a pint of cream and I got one cup out of it.  Packaged butter is running about $2.25 right now and I get 2 cups of butter from it.  SO, packaged butter is less expensive by about half, but making the butter is fun!

I Love the taste of homemade butter. Thanks so very much for this recipe. I also found that if I put soured cream in the blender about 3/4 the way full I can make sour cream for baked potatoes. Thanks again

Easy with a Kitchen aid.  I've adapted this recipe to make "special butter", as my kids call it.  Cinnamon/sugar and oven roasted garlic butter.  You could make any flavored butter you want!

I made this butter last week.  It's very good.  One quart heavy cream yielded 13oz butter and 2c liquid.  I used cheesecloth to strain out the solids and form a ball of butter.  Thank you for a good basic recipe.

The best! I had some heavy cream left over from Holiday Baking/Cooking that I didn't want to just throw out. I came across this recipe and faintly remembered making homemade butter in kindergarten and how extremely delicious it was.  I am so glad I made this! It's so much more flavorful that regular butter from the store, and the fact that it is fresh and homemade... Bonus!!  Just make sure you rinse the butter well after draining off the liquid (keep the liquid for any recipe asking for buttermilk) or else your butter will go rancid and from what I've read, adding salt helps the butter "keep" as well.  

 I knew I wanted to make something to go with this butter right away, so I made J.P's Big Daddy Biscuits also from this site.  My eyes literally rolled into the back of my head - a match made in heaven!! Thank you!

Ok so this was strange but its how im going to make my butter from now on... I put 2 small cartons of heavy cream in a kitchenaid mixer and beat it on high, covering with a towel to avoid splatter. After about 10 minutes I check and my towel is soaked so I turn it off to find a beater FULL of butter and all the liquid in the bowl! (and all over my counter) so no pressing, just some mopping up! Easy enough for deliciously rich and creamy tasting butter! Ill try with less cream next time and maybe it wont be as messy.

You can do this with younger children, providing fun family traditions in the kitchen. You don't need a blender. Just put your cream in a small jar and place a marble inside, then screw the lid on. Shake the jar until the cream turns into butter. It will probably take up to 20 minutes or more, depending on how hard and vigorously you shake. Butter will begin to form in the center, and then you can just drain the butter milk and scoop the butter out of your jar onto your warm bread! Kids love shaking the butter jar!

This couldn't be easier to make.  I simply added the cream to my food processor and let it do the work.  I word of advice, make sure to strain off all of the buttermilk and rinse the butter a few times to make sure the buttermilk is gone.  I would recommend using cheesecloth to strain the butter but if that is not available a fine mesh strainer will work too.

Very easy to do...this took longer for me, about 15 minutes in my Kitchenaid. I poured everything through some muslin cloth over a strainer, and then gathered up the ends of the cloth and twisted, wringing out all the liquid. I was left with a nice, neat ball of butter. It was so much more fresh and flavorful than store bought, which just tastes like grease compared to this stuff. It is completely worth it, very little effort to make and a great payoff.

I used a hand mixer instead of a food processor or blender and I thought I was doing something wrong as it took quite a while (around 25-30 minutes of mixing) until the butter began to separate.  I then squeezed the buttermilk out using both my hands and then a spatula, added the salt and mixed, and then rinsed with water.  Overall, very easy and tastes great.

Super easy, and super good.  Loved this recipe, why I had not thought to try before I do not know. I for sure will use often and I will never run short of butter again. Looking forward to trying different taste, extra salt, honey, maple syrup. thoughts are endless.  Thanks for the recipe.

SUPER SUPER easy and fast! My kids loved adding the heavy cream and a pinch of salt to the food processor and then watching it turn from a liquid to a solid in about 9 minutes. Once solid, I drained the excess liquid and used a piece of cheese cloth to squeeze out any remaining liquid from the "butter ball". What a wonderful recipe...a recipe you can use in so many other recipes...and it's a super fresh ingredient!

You can also make butter by shaking it in a tightly sealed container, though it takes more time and effort.

Quick, easy, so worth it! I saved the spun out milk and used it for other recipes. Nice touch! I dont think I will purchase butter again, since I usually have heavy cream on hand. Thanks for the life changing recipe. I used a standing mixer.

Make sure the heavy cream is very cold before mixing.  It helps the process along.  Also, use a cheesecloth stretched over a bowl to strain the butter.  What's left in the bowl is buttermilk.

This is a easy recipe to make butter..It will only work with heavy cream, not milk or even half and half .... it only took about 10-12 minutes to make..you just set it on 6-8 on the kitchen aid mixer and forget it for about 10 min that is lol   I found that if you left it on 8 you will get a splatter mess so I left it on 6 and it did not spaltter as much after about 10 mins I did put it on 8 for a bit though ..great recipe overall !!!

I started this in the blender (I don't have a food processer) and when it started to thicken up it was hard to keep it down where the blades were.  I ended up scraping it all out of the blender and into a bowl where I finished it with a hand mixer.  After all that, it was definately worth the effort!  My mom was so impressed and said she hadn't had butter this good since her Grandma used to make butter on the farm.  I will definately be making it again (but with the mixer from the start!)

So easy!  I used a hand mixer (about 10-15 minutes) and just used my hands to squeeze.  My 3 year old loves to help in the kitchen and this was "skill level appropiate" for her age.  :)

I made this last night. I used my Kitchenaid mixer with the whip attachment. I put it on speed 8 for about 15minutes and used a cheesecloth to strain the milk from it. This was a very easy process and delicious, I will be making this again!

This was amazing! I used my kitchen aid mixer and whipped it for around 15 minutes. It was ready when it looked chunky and yellowish. There was also a little bit of milk on the bottom. I then just used my hands to squeeze it and rinsed it every now and then with cold water. I will definitely use a cheese cloth next time!

Very easy recipe and turned out nicely.  I would say that if you don't have a food processor then it takes a little more effort then the details imply but overall really good!

Soo fun! I never thought of making my own butter. It was so easy-no butter churn required :o) Tastes great, not sure how cost effective it was though. one minute it was creamy liquid the next it was butter,pretty cool.

This was my first time making homemade butter and it was super simple. It tastes wonderful. I experimented a little. I used my mixer to make it, and my Magic Bullet. Both do equally as good a job, but the Magic Bullet is a lot of work. FYI, a little salt goes a long way, I used the 1/4 tsp that this recipe called for, and it seems like it was a little much.

Just a hint for all those living around the equator, keep some ice cubes handy while blending during hot summers. Add a couple of ice cubes in intervals and soft butter will surface in no time!

This was wonderful, it has a light texture without the oily film left on my tounge with regular butter.  I thought I would be smart and make it in my Vita-Mix, WRONG idea. Because the vita-mix spins so fast, it can heat things up and you can actually make soup in it. I was waiting for the butter to start clumping, and the Vita-mix heated up and turned the butter back into liquid, so I started again, this time with my food processor, and new cold cream. This time it turned out great! I squeezed out the liquid with my hands, then split the batch in half. One half went into my ramekin and into the fridge, the other half I put honey and cinnamon into, yum! With the left over liquid, I added vanilla paste and drank it, again yum!

Ummmm ... I've done this without even trying while whipping cream for cake toppings!  I used the butter as substitute for margarine and oil in baking and cooking because I hate throwing out my "failures" if they're edible), but didn't know if you were supposed to do that!  It's good to know that I stumbled on a quick-and-easy (not to mention sort of economic) way to make butter. :D

I was visiting my Mom's and ran across this recipe.  I cut and pasted the link and emailed it to my husband, no explanation--just the link.  When I arrived home on Sunday there was fresh butter waiting for me.  Hmmmm, how did I know that would happen?  Anyway, we now make this butter every Saturday morning and it is delicious. Just be sure to not skimp on the salt and to drain it really well with either cheesecloth or almond milk bags (which can be washed and re-used).  There is just something deeply joyful about making homemade butter, even if in a blender!

Perfect recipe thank you, I made a test batch as I wanted to try before Thanksgiving and I had my 11 year old son help me and it turned out fantastic and my son was amazed at the process. Thank you for a great recipe and a great homemade addition to our Thanksgiving this year.

So easy and fun!  When I was a child in school, the teacher poured cream into an empty cool whip container.  She sealed the lid and handed it to the first child and intructed each of us to shake the bowl vigorously.  By the time the last child (about 25th) handled it, it was completely solid.  It was such a fun and delicious learning experience!

I feel a little silly rating something as simple as buter with five stars, but this butter is as good as it gets.  I used my kitchenaid mixer with the whisk attachment and ran it on high until it went from the whipped back into the liquid phase.  I had to turn it down when it became liquid again because it splattered everywhere.  I ran the mixer until it was solid- my butter attached itself to the whisk, and then I poured out the buttermilk that was left remaining in the bowl.  I followed others' suggestion to squeeze it with the cheesecloth, spatula, etc but there was no liquid left in my butter to drain.  I didn't rinse the butter because I forgot to, and it was still great- not sure why some said that was necessary.

We use this recipe ALL the time and it's the best! We add a little fresh minced garlic for garlic bread or omit the salt and a little sugar and cinnamon. You can play with it by adding almost anything. My favorite is adding about 1 tablespoon of honey at the very end of the whipping time and spreading it on pancakes, YUM YUM. My husband likes to add honey and grated orange rind, which is also very good on pancakes, toast or any type of muffin or bread. The skies the limit with this recipe.  Have fun!

AMAZING!!  I can't believe I've been wasting so much $$ on store bought butter.  The first batch I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 3 dashes of salt.  my hubby said it needs more.  The 2nd batch I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream, 1/4 tsp of salt, 3 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon which made an amazing topping for toast, pancakes, waffles, grilled P B & J! ... you name it!!!  I'm still in awww over this :)  THANK YOU All Recipes!

WOW! I was a little skeptical about this recipe because I thought that "heavy whipping cream" only made "heavy whipping cream." I learn a lot from this web site about cooking! :) I didn't have cheesecloth, so I used a strainer with a paper towel and pushed the excess milk out with a cup. Kind of a messy way to do it but it worked and now I have homemade butter in my kitchen! Thaks so much for the recipe!!

I made this when my kids where small. I was homeroom mom, and I put the ingredients in a plastic jar and let the kids take turns shaking it. The kids got a major kick out of making butter this way, and a bigger kick out of eating what they got to make!!!  It's just wonderful!!!

You can also put this in baby food jars, give it to the kids and let them shake it until it turns into butter.  Takes a while, but keeps them busy, and they can help you cook!

Freshly-made butter tastes SO much better than storebought. I added the salt directly to the cream before beating. It takes longer than I would've expected, even with a Kitchenaid mixer, so be patient. When the butter formed, I scooped it out with my hands, packed it into a ball to squeeze the liquid out, and rinsed it under cold running water before using because I can't stand the taste of the excess liquid.

Very yummy and easy too! We are studying through the Little House series and wanted to try to make butter-the easy way! We used the liquid that we pressed out of the butter for buttermilk cornbread. We added 3 drops of yellow food coloring to the cream before we started.What a tasty lesson!

This was awesome!  I had about half a cup of cream and didn't know how to use it...I'm very glad I found this recipe!  I only needed to mix it for about 6 minutes, but I'm sure it wouldn't have hurt it to do more.  I added maybe 1/8 tsp. salt, and  flavored it with raspberry preserves from Trader Joe's.  Very, very tasty on crackers!  Only problem was that the moisture in the preserves made it more like a chutney than a butter.  Still incredible, though!

I made several different types of compound butters with the product from this recipe but the overwhelming favorite is roasted fresh garlic and prepared horseradish! I used a tablespoon of each per 1/4 Lb. of butter and use it for steaks on the grill. MAN!!!!

I just made this butter, and it is absolutely freaking delicious! Use the food processor at about eight minutes. Are used a heavy organic cream, almost 55% fat, so there was no liquid to drain off! Turned out cream. I highly recommend this!!!

I use small amounts of cream and as soon as I see liquid I start pouring it off. Hand squeezing is easy if you wear one time use plastic gloves.

I have always wanted to try making my own butter.  I used my food processor and it was so much fun watching it transform from whipping cream to a sudden drop in height as it became thicker. I used my strainer to push out the liquid and pressed the butter into a candy mold with 6 different designs.  I pressed down again on the butter with a paper towel over the mold to help get the last of the liquid out and placed the mold in the freezer for later. Super easy and sure to be a crowd pleaser.

This recipe is great! Some tips to get the best butter: real butter IS yellow if it comes from grass-fed cows. The best cream to use is good organic cream from a local farm or co-op (I bought a quart of cream at PCC). Make sure it's not ultra-pasteurized. Ideally, you'll only want to fill your jar/blender/food-processor half-way (so it reduces splash and leaves room for lots of movement so the cream breaks down quickly) with room-temperature cream (I started with a test batch so I left about half a pint in a jar on the counter for about 2 hours - the half pint made about 1/4 cup of butter). This butter keeps for a year in the freezer or about a week in the fridge (and salted lasts a little longer than unsalted). I feel like Betty Crocker now. :) Happy butter making!

I have been making butter like this for years.  My students really enjoy making this in the classroom, except we use a mason jar and shake it.  They are astounded by the transformation; and it is so delicious on crackers!

It was easy, and turned out fine, but actually more expensive than store bought butter, so I don't know that I'll be doing this again.  I processed 2 cups of cream in the food processor for 10 minutes, then I scooped the butter out, wrapped it in cheese cloth and rinsed it thoroughly and pressed all the liquid out before putting it in a container.  I got barely 1 cup of butter, and it cost me about $5 ($2 for the cream, and $3 for the cheesecloth).

Wow. I never realized it was this easy to make butter! I poured the cream into my food processor and in 10 min it was butter. Next time I will try using a cheesecloth to drain and use the leftover buttermilk for pancakes. I can't wait to try it again and add different herbs/flavors. I usually buy organic unsalted butter for cooking and it's a little pricy - buying the organic cream and just making my own will save so much.  Thank you!!

I couldn't believe how easy this was.  I used the buttermilk in pancake batter.  Then used the butter on top.  It was the best thing ever.  My husband loved it, I will make this again and again.

teehee!  Great idea.  I whipped whipping cream instead of heavy cream in a food processor.  My batch of butter was made for an Oreo frosting that is based on butter, and homemade butter turned out great without an overly-buttery taste.  Try my recipe out: 1/2 cup homemade butter; 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 5 finely chopped Oreos; 2 tablespoon cream-milk (the excess milk-like liquid produced by making homemade butter); dash salt.  Cream all ingredients together on high speed and beat until smooth :)

Super easy. The spatula tip made draining the liquid so easy. Pressed it down with a paper towel. I made the mistake of adding the salt at the beginning and it was a little to salty, so I added a couple pinches of sugar and it evened it out nicely. This recipe will put Land-O-Lakes out of business! Yum, Yum, Yum!!!!!

I have always made this by putting it in a jar and shaking. My way is hard work. Thanks for showing me a faster, easier way.

It may cost you more to make this based upon the cost of heavy cream in your area. It may be less expensive if you can find real cream from a farmer in your area.  Some kids love this project...pour in a jar and let all the kids take turns shaking the jar.  Good laughs and builds muscle too.

I love this recipe.  Anything that I can make at home fresh is great !

Wow! I was so surprised to see this actually WORKS! It came out very good, the only thing different is that it seems to retain that whipping cream flavor, so its a bit sweeter butter than what I'm used to. Melts the same and everything but I would just use this for toast, bagels, ect as it carries a slightly sweetened taste.

This recipe is so simple, yet so yummy. The only thing to be aware of is the time, it didn't take me 10 minutes. More like 30, but I used a standing mixer with a whisk attachment instead of a food processor. I added lots of herbs to make herb butter and it was fabulous!

I remember making this as a kid for fun. Its so simple. I just put it in my kitchen aid stand mixer with the whisk attatchment, flipped a switch and pressed out the liquid with a spatula. Taste and texture were great.

This was fun to do, but definitely needed salt.  I served it with pancakes and we enjoyed it.  I don't think it's worth the effort, though.

This is so simple,easy and good. I did the small container with a marble in it and shook for about 20 min for the small amount of cream I had.  It really works! smooth creamy butter.  Going to buy a larger amount af cream and do the blender / processor method. No more store bought butter for me.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I came home from the store, opened up the heavy cream, poured it into the processor, turned it on and by the time I put away the rest of my groceries, the butter was done.   I made up a get well basket for a friend using bagels and this butter.  I added some honey, brown sugar and cinnamon and it really tasted like the butter from The Outback Steakhouse !  It got rave reviews from the patient & his visitors as well. Thanks so much.

This was way easy. I used my food prossesor and in about 5 min. I had butter. Sweet creamy butter. I usually buy at 3.49 a pound but now I have 2 pounds for about 3.78. Oh and the trick with the liquid is use a spatula and squeeze it out. I"ts really easy. I read that trick here here and used it. I added a little salt. I think it's creamier than store bought.

I just want to add that this makes a fun project for kids.  My kids learned this way of making butter on a field trip.  They were given heavy cream in a mason jar and shook them on their walk to the museum.  After the ten minute walk they had butter and were so excited.  Just wanted to let you all know!

I used my stand mixer with the whisk attachment. The taste is very mild and the process is fun, but if I were to do it again, I would go to Whole Foods and find a fancy cream, or at least fold in some honey or herbs. Without one of those modifications, store-bought butter (or my fave, the organic vegan Earth Balance spread) is easier and probably cheaper. I think you just need something to add value/novelty to the end product.

We make butter every year for Thanksgiving with my grandma's butter churn-tradition. Never used a food processor. Definitely rinse with cold water when it's done so you get the buttermilk out. A spatula works fine for that, and my mom likes to use cheesecloth to press the liquid out. We season it with salt after that and other seasonings sometimes. The Garlic Butter recipe on this website is great.

Thank you for the recipe!!! I needed unsalted butter for a recipe and had started mixing before I realized I was out. I live in a remote area and takes me over an hour to get to a store. After thinking about it for awhile I remember making butter in school, which was over fourty years ago, but couldn't remember the process. Looked on the web and found this one... WORKED JUST AS I REMEMBERED, PERFECT!!! Thank you....

I had no idea that butter was this easy to make.  When finished, I spread it into candy snow-flake molds to make individual size portions.

This was fun to make, and tasted great!  Added some honey once it started looking curdled.  Before I knew it, milk was shooting out of my mixer, and I had honey butter!

Just made this, can't wait to make bread or something for it to go on tomorrow!
1 pint of cream made 12 tbsp. for me, and yielded about 1 1/2 c. buttermilk. First the cream roughly doubled in size (use a large bowl) then after about 5 minutes of beating reached about whipped cream type consistancy. It remained that way about another five minutes, then quickly went to cottage cheese looking and then super dense and flinging milk all around the bowl...when little splatters went on the counter and I thought the motor would go out on my hand mixer, I knew it was butter, lol. Next time I will have cheesecloth handy, as pushing it around with a spoon to squeeze out excess milk got old fast. Other than that, really really easy to do, and hopefully tastes awesome...but how could it not, it's butter!

Wow!  This was pretty amazing!  I used my KitchenAid Mixer on speed 10 and, then, strained the butter through a cheese cloth.  Didn't wash it under cold water and it was still great.  I mixed it with some fresh tarragon, salt, black pepper, and lemon juice - yummy!  Won't be buying much store-made butter anymore!

I made this recipe using my stand mixer. I had so much fun watch the cream in its different stages. To make my butter more yellow, I heated 2 grated baby carrots in about 1/2 cup of milk.  I heated and stirred till the milk turned bright yellow-orange.  Then I strained out the carrots pcs and added the milk to the cream just before mixing.  It took about 10-15 min for the butter to come.  I pressed and rinsed it well.  The butter is absolutely delicious and you can't taste the carrots and it has no artificial coloring to make it a nice yellow color.

This tastes fantastic! I always buy butter with only cream and salt. Now, I don't need to spend $4 on a small tub. I used a good quality cream for $2 and a little salt. I rinsed out the chunks with cold water from the fridge, pushing a spatulat to make sure it was all out. Then, I laid some paper towel on the bench, wrapped it up and let it soak for a few minutes. I put it into a bowl, added salt and mixed well. Placed the butter into a small ceramic bowl and covered with alfoil. Within 2 hours it had firmed and was ready to eat. The butter has not gone rock hard, but very lovely and tasty. I will be making butter this way from now on.

Very good made with raw organic cream from pastured grass-fed cows. The high vitamin content and good saturated fats make this a staple in our home. All we use is flax oil (as a condiment only), EVOO, raw EV-coconut oil and homemade butter. I am learning more about culturing butter, I'd love to see some of those in here. 
To the lady who thought this is cheaper than store bought... I get 1 qt. raw cream for $8, and I get 1# of butter out of that. Not bad for health food IMHO. ;)

this is great.  I included a picture (halloween style) lol  anyway thanks a bunch. Oh and kids think this is amazing if they didn't grow up like a lot of us did in the "good ol' days" And by the way, I used 2 cups of cream and this made 8-oz of butter (measured by weight) and about the same amount of butter milk. I didn't use salt because I'm using this for baking.

I have made homemade butter before in a blender and then again in a food processor. I have to admit that it was faster to make the butter but I prefer to to make butter by pouring the cream into a jar with a tight fitting piece of saran wrap and the lid goes on tight after that and then just shake till you think your arms are going to fall off. I found that I have more control of how the butter comes out and I believe that slower is better. Afterwards I rinse my butter several times before placing it in a container and then refrigerate it. Take it out about 15 minutes before you use it. But always place it back in the fridge when you're finished with it and it will keep a whole lot  longer. Enjoy

Great recipe!  I used a small mini chopper to make this creamy delicious butter without a mess.  I poured out the liquid and there was no need to strain or rinse the butter.  My husband bypassed the jelly in his biscuit and used only this delicious butter.  Tasted better than the store bought butter.

BUTTER! I takes everything better. I used my stand mixer, because I'm lazy. It's one of the easiest things I do for baking/cooking. ready in 10-15 minutes depending in the volume of heavy cream. CAUTION-When using a stand mixer, drape a towel over the unit. if you do not, you'll have a heck of a mess on your hands. Get your kids involved. They'll love watching the transformation.

it would help tremendously if the recipe had mentioned that you needed ice around the mixer to allow the hardening and separation. I could've run the mixer all night and it still wouldn't have separated.

I made this recipe with 2 cups heavy whipping cream and just a couple shakes of fine sea salt. I started out with it in my blender but it created an air pocket and would not blend so I moved it to my kitchen aid mixer and it was ready in about 6 minutes.  I poured most of the liquid into the sink and the rest I rollee in paper towels until dry. I will purchase cheese cloth for my next batch to wring out the liquid. I LOVE the flavor and how very simple it was to make!

LOVE IT!!!!  I used my kitchen aid food processor on high for a few minutes then low then high I did this a few times seemed to take the liquid out of it faster. I didn't have to squeeze any liquid out of the butter just scoop it out at an angle away from the liquid. I have been concerned about store bought margarine after I heard it was one molecule away from being plastic. I have been using butter for about a month now and was online looking for a butter crock and I found this recipe and now I am hooked

Five stars just for the cool factor alone.  I used a half pint container, it took about 7 minutes to separate.  I used a spatula to get the majority of milk out then I put the butter ball in a paper towel and squeezed more out.  I put it back in the food processor and added salt and garlic.  It ended up with a really nice whipped texture.  Love it!

Turned out wonderful and my husband was impressed!  Rinsed the butter in an ice water bath three times to help remove all buttermilk.  I have a vintage wooden butter mold and decided to try it out.  Cleaned in lukewarm water then treated the wood with canola oil. Worked well. All in all I'm happy with the results.

Tis is good,I already know how to make this,just to tell you that make sure to knead ALL of the buttermilk OUT.
Once,I didn't get all of it out,and my butter turned sour.
When I spread it on my toast,it smelled like rotten cheese.

I was raised on a farm so my mother used to make her own churned butter.  she would save the cream until she had enough to churn and of coarse it fermented and then she used butter molds to mold it into pound molds.  I still have one of the wooden molds.  It was a very labor intensive process.  The homemade butter she made had a very strong taste to it, nothing like what you buy in the stores.

I make my own butter as a camping tradition.  I found out that plain old whipping cream works just as well.  We pour it into a jar and pass it around the campsite until it turns to butter.  I don't go through a squeezing process (and it doesn't make a difference to me), I just fish the butter out of the jar and put it in its own container.  We use the buttermilk for pancakes and the butter for many camp fire items.

I removed the liquid by placing the butter on a loosely woven towel - cheese cloth might work also, just layer it a bit. I then just twisted the liquid out. I got great results.

I made my homemade butter the old fashion way, in a jar.  It takes a bit longer but it is a great arm workout!!  I used paper towels to drain the excess water which worked out better than cheese cloth in my opinion.  This was a fun recipe to try, but I will probably use a food processer next time

I first saw this on a site for kids and it looked like lots of fun -it was!  I poured a little heavy cream in a clean baby jar, tightened it & let the kids go to town shaking it.  After taking turns for about 20 minutes, the butter & liquid separated.  I poured off the liquid and stuck it in the fridge to harden.  Next time I'll rinse it like others have recommended to see if it makes a difference.

This is a very simple and completely yummy recipe.  I used my regular paddle beater and strained the curds out.  It takes a lot of pressing down on the butter to get all the liquid out.  I saved the buttermilk to drink and/or use in other things.

WOW! I made butter!  I can't believe it.  I did it as a child with a churn at a girl scout excursion but that was it.  I had a little problem getting all the water out but I'm sure the more I do this, the better I'll get.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I never knew it was so simple and easy to make homemade butter. I used the wire whisk attachment on my hand mixer. I used just one cup heavy cream and it took less than 10 minutes. I used the butter to make garlic bread fantastique, also from this site. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm new to the whole cooking scene, and I think I made this more difficult than it needed to be.  I had to leave it on the blender for longer then 10 minutes, but it turned out great.    We tasted it after it had been chilled and decided it needed more taste so I melted it partly and added honey.  Taste faboos!

DE-LIC-IOUS!! I made it without the salt. Hubby recommended that I use salt next time since he is a salt lover. I really don't think it needs it. Better for baking that way!!

This is so simple, but so delicious. I homeschool my son, and for science, one of our experiments was to make butter using heavy cream by putting the cream into a clean glass jar with lid, and shaking it until it became butter. It tastes so good! However, I did NOT have luck using my blender. A mixer or food processor is really necessary for this recipe.

Worked out Great!! I used whipping cream in the food processer (I chilled the blade first).  Processed for about 8 minutes, strained off the buttermilk and mashed into a plastic container.  Delicious!! Thanks for the recipe.

omg!!! At first the cream just formed the typical "whipped cream" peaks....and I got discouraged. But then I simply stirred the cream in the blender with a spoon and resumed the blend function. About 5 minutes later it became watery/globule-like and eventually formed into a block of butter! It's been hard to eat anything but bread and butter all day.

Oh, I wish I could give this 100 stars!! I am so thrilled with this recipe!! I made it in my Kitchen Aid mixer. Beat on 8 for 8 minutes. I added the salt as it was mixing. I gathered up the butter from the milk as best I could, then lined my strainer with cheese cloth and squeezed out the rest of the milk. It was super simple. The whole process took less them 20 minutes including clean up. I will never buy butter again. The recipe makes about a pound of butter.

I remember making this as a kid using a jar. Now that I'm all grown up, I decided to cheat and use the Kitchen Aid. I kept mixing and mixing and mixing and nothing happened, but all of a sudden, the liquid separated from the cream and it turned out perfectly!

I have to say... I feel kinda silly for being so proud of myself for doing something SO simple!!  I made butter!  It really does taste better than store bought, and yes, it melts into your toast just like "real" butter, lol  Store bought butter can sometimes have a rancid taste to me, but this is smooth and creamy.  I was a little afraid to rinse my treasure with water, (as instructed by reviews) but it beaded off just like it should and came out beautiful.

We learned to do this when visiting a local dairy this fall.  They put 1/2 a small container of whipping cream into a container with a lid, then passed it around to all the kids to shake, shake, shake.  Then we'd open it along the way and see the different textures -- from liquid, to whipped cream, to butter.  It's a lot of fun for the kids and makes a great presentation and discussion at the dinner table!

I first made butter "accidentally" when I overwhipped heavy cream trying to make whipped cream with my KitchenAid.  This time I made it "on purpose" following this recipe LOL.  It turned out absolutely delicious, and I will make it often.  I look forward to making fresh homemade butter for my holiday baking.

Yummy! I tried to make this in the blender, but it did not work. It only mixed the bottom bit. So I moved it into a bowl and finished with a hand mixer. I thought it would never separate, but suddenly liquid appeared and only a little while longer and it was done! Next time will have muslin on hand to strain. Although I don't care how yellow my butter looks, the source of the milk determines the color of the butter. So for everyone that says that real butter isn't yellow... Sometimes it is! Mine is exactly the same color as store bought.

Now this was neat as can  be.... I gathered the 6 of our 9 kids and told them we were doing a "experiment" with buttermilk. They loved watching it form to butter.  We then added garlic and salt and made garlic bread.

I tried this recipe and it looked just like the picture. Blended it in the food processor but wasn't sure when it was ready since this was my first time(took about 6 minutes). I turned the machine off and on and at the same time drained any liquids. When the cream is wet it sits on the bottom of the processor blending, but when it's done it becomes stiff like butter and gets plastered to the sides of the processor, that's when you know it's done. With the container of butter and your spatula, keep pressing the white liquid (which is the buttermilk)out of the butter, it does take about 5 min to do this. I did a taste test with our favorite high-end store bought butter, couldn't tell the difference. I added a little salt, and since it is so light in color I added a drop of yellow foodcoloring. Delicious!

I decided to try this, but I knew, I just knew that it wasn't going to work.  Boy, was I wrong!!!  It took exactly ten minutes for the cream to turn into butter.  Who would have thought homemade butter was this easy?  All I did was squeeze it out in my hand over the sink, and then I plopped it in a little crock.  Can't give this one less than five stars, and would give more if I could!  Thanks!

Ran across this recipe a little while ago - didn't even realize it was this easy!  I went out and bought a pint of whipping cream earlier today just to try this and it turned out perfect!  It states to use heavy whipping cream, but mine was successful with regular whipping cream, so you can go either way I think.  Used my KitchenAid with whip attachment for 10 minutes.  Started slow and worked up to speed 6 then went back down to slow once the buttermilk formed to prevent splashing.  Rinsed with cold water and squeezed the butter until the water ran clear, patted with a paper towel and squeezed some more.  Then I put it in a bowl and mixed in the salt with a fork. I'm never buying store bought butter or margarine again!

I dont have a Kitchen Aid but a standing mixer so I put my organic raw cream in it and turned it on to about medium.  This probably took 15 minutes but it came out butter!! I was so excited since I have been wanting to make butter for a long time now.

This was absolutely wonderful. I had no idea how easy it is to make butter. Now that I know I will be doing this all the time, it tastes soooo... much better than the store bought stuff.

I only ever made butter once before, years ago in my blender, just to see if I could do it.  This time I used my Kitchen Aid mixer.  Either way, it's a lot easier than shaking or churning.  The butter turned out great.  Now I just have to remember to make it more often to go on homemade breads.

Fantastic! I used my Magic Bullet, and it took 5-6 minutes. I then used a spatula to get all the liquid out. It is SOOOO much better than store bought. No more Country Crock for me!

Great Activity too. My kids had no idea where butter came from so what a great way to teach them and spend time with them. While the processor was going we looked up old style churns and talked about how tough that would have been.

Great idea. Thanks.

I have to say this was easier than i thought it would be.  i went to make grits this morning and realized i was out of butter, but i had heavy cream.  so i thought i would give it a whirl.  i had to add a tad more salt than in the recipe, but otherwise it only took me about 5 minutes with my hand mixer.  for large quantities i can see needing the cuisinart.  will use this again definitely!!!

Awesome.  Because I have a VitaMixer and not a food-processor/blender, it took about the same amount of time but that's because I had to keep shutting off the VitaMixer and scraping the sides.  Ended up with whipped butter and not butter like I was envisioning, but hey, I'm not complaining.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Is cheaper than buying a pound.

Well,we go thru alot of butter so I cant say I can make this every week but this is awesome! You can bet that I'm buying the splatter shield real soon also! I did use the plastic wrap  to tent it which pretty well worked-better than curling a paper plate which didnt work at all. As I get all the kinks out of my set-up and know better what I'm doing then I'll continue to make it more often-this was my 2nd time since last year. I made 2 batches. I wont wait as long next time-hopefully by next month!

I had 6 cups of heavy cream that was past its best-before date, so I decided to make this.  As has been suggested, I didn't add the salt prior to mixing, and found that while the cream thickened, it wouldn't separate (whipped it with a hand mixer for more than 10 minutes).  I added the salt, and within about 60 seconds it got the process going and I got buttermilk.  Strained with napkins, and eventually a cheesecloth.  Yield was approximately 1 & 1/3 lbs butter.

No changes were made. Easy peasy. Now the proof of the butter is in the spreading.  Will be making homemade bread  later. Home made and homemade butter. Mm mm good.

I will never buy store bought again! Wonderful recipe, so easy! I would recommend putting some foil or cling wrap around the top of the bowl if you make it in a stand mixer like I did. It gets rather splashy at the end. Still, I just put foil around the top to cut down on any mess, and rinsed and squeezed out the butter by hand. I kept the buttermilk to use for baking. I'm loving it!

I used my standing mixer and it was ready in less than 5 minutes. I put the butter ball in a clean, cotton kitchen towel and squeezed out the excess liquid that way. I imagine you can also use cheese cloth. I saved the liquid for other recipes like macaroni & cheese or mashed potatoes. If you make unsalted butter, you can use the liquid as coffee creamer.  The butter butter tasted exactly like butter, perfect consistency, and was so easy ANYONE can do it.

Really easy. Blend til it turns to whip cream, keep going til it turns liquid again. Then ball up the butter. I used a coffee filter to get excess liquid out

I had butter after blending with ninja for 5-6 minutes instead of 10. I strained using cheesecloth per the other reviews. Put back in ninja food processor with about a cup of cold refrigerator water, blended for another minute or so and then strained again. Super easy, though a little messy. I used 3 cups of whipping cream so I added a little over a 1/4 tsp of salt and it’s a little salty. Next time I’ll stick with the 1/4 tsp for up to a quart of cream. I did read that you could just rinse it another time to wash some of the salt out, but I’m just going to deal with it this time.

Great recipe and just as easy as stated. I used my hand mixer it took approximately 10 minutes to turn into butter. But the amount of butter it makes is not worth doing this instead of buying my salted butter that I normally buy. It would cost more to make the equivalent of butter that I buy. Nevertheless it was still fun to make.

The butter was so easy to make and so delightful my guests were eating slices of it alone! It takes a bit more than 10 minutes  although you can do other things as your butter churns. I added truffle salt and it was amazing! I also added garlic salt to one batch, also delicious. As for the milk I just strained my butter with a fine sieve, no squeezing necessary. I used the leftover milk to marinate chicken thighs. They turned out juicy and flavorful. I plan to make my own butter regularly now. Thank you for the recipe!

It's butter.  You shake it.  How hard can it be?  FWIW - The taste depends on the taste of the cream =)

I thought the instructions were very clear. But I also know my way around from watching my grandmother. She used a cheese cloth and squeezed the milk out. I also think you should add a tad bit of olive oil to keep it smooth and spreadable. But that's just an option and is not important.

Easy recipe with fantastic results 
Made this butter when the season's butter/sugar corn was available and it is very tasty. 
Used the buttermilk for soaking chicken pieces before deep frying. 
Will make again and again

One quart of heavy whipping cream will make 13 ounces of butter.  In a mixer on 8 or the creaming speed it will take a minimum of 10 minutes and cover the bowl while it 's running. it will look like crumbled bleu cheese and you shouldn't see much liquid. it will be on the bottom of the bowl. It's awesome!!

I make homemade butter for the holidays every year.  This is so easy to make. Just make sure you leave it out for a long time prior to use because it becomes really hard after sitting in the refrigerator.

Very Easy to make butter this way. We use a food processor and just pour the cream in and turn it on. Takes about 10 minutes or so and you will see the butter. Then we use a spatula or spoon to squeeze the butter and drain off the liquid. Turn the processor back on and pour in some ice water. Let this run for about two minutes and press and drain again. You can repeat this until the liquid is almost clear. This helps rinse the butter really good. The ice water helps to separate the butter and the cream.

Not without trial and error, I just made butter!!!  I'm not fortunate enough to own a stand mixer and for a minute felt like I had some energy so I threw a cup of heavy cream into a mason jar and started to shake. That lasted about ten minutes and felt like 40. So I poured what was almost whipped cream into my food processor thinking that would do the trick. Nope. Because it was almost whipped cream it all went onto the sides of the bowl and nothing was being whipped. Hmmmm...there's got to be a way short of a churn. Tried it with my hand held stick blender. Nope. Finally grabbed the ol reliable hand mixer and viola! In five minutes it changed right before my eyes!!! In less than ten total  the buttermilk water was splashing all over the counter. This is so great!!! 
Took the lump o' butter out of the bowl and squeezed it in some cheesecloth, very little water came out, and done. Of course tried some on a piece of warm toast and wow! Yummm. Thank you for sharing. Ps. I only used a cup of cream and it yielded about five tablespoons of butter. I also added a little salt.

I have never made butter before and this wasn't just easy it was super easy.  I made a small batch the first time and then a larger batch the second time.  I always read the reviews before I start a recipe in case there is tips not in the recipe.  This recipe tastes like expensive European butter. I will never buy butter again.  I used my kitchen aid with the whip attachment and it took no time at all.

I used my food processor and followed the recipe and directions exactly until the final step.  I learned many years ago that when you want to rinse the butter to get rid of the excess whey (which may cause the butter to go rancid) rinse the cheese cloth covered butter in ice water several times until the water is clear.  Gently dry off the butter and wrap tightly in cling film.  Use fresh cling film each time you need to rewrap  the butter.
My local market only charges $ .30 more for a quart of heavy cream over the price of a pint.  (Go figure...). As of this writing, it only costs $4.49 to make about 20 ounces of butter.
Follow the directions and you won't be sorry.
Enjoy!

There are two kinds of food processors: Cuisinart style, which has the food bowl on top of the motor and the other kind, with food bowl sitting beside the motor. I used the Cuisinart, a small one, not big enough to take 1qt cream in one go, so I made 2 batches. First batch was fine. Second batch took much longer--I think because heat from the motor interfered. Next time I'll use my stand mixer w/paddle.

The result, by the way, was   fine, but it was just butter. That is, NOT some super-fab butter sensationally better than the store-bought stuff produced by Big Udder. It was just plain old butter, and very nice. Also, depending on local pricing, it may not be economical. Mine cost about double the store-bought stuff, but at least I got some buttermilk for pancakes.

I didn't read the review where it said you should rinse it after, but it still came out awesome after squeezing all the liquid out. Afterwards, I rolled it in some plastic wrap. Very cool to be able to say I made my own butter!

I used my Cuisinart to blend it and it took a while about 5-10 minutes for each section.  I bought a half gallon of whipping cream and didn't know what to do with so much.  So, luckily All Recipes has wonderful cooks who taught me how to make butter.  I did put it into cheese cloth and squeezed and rinsed it in cold water and put it into square zip lock containers.  I can't believe I made butter...thanks..

I didn't add the salt,as I like unsalted butter. So much better than store bought. You do have to rinse the butter until it runs clear.

At first I thought I was doing it wrong, it wasn't separating. Was using hand blender, so I turned the speed done and it started to separate. Took more like 15 min. Than took handfuls, squeezed out extra buttermilk and rinsed under cold water. Than mixed in salt. Turned out great!!! Thank you so much. Now my mother in-law can have real butter without us going broke. Thank you!!!!

I can't believe I've never made butter! I had a little bit of cream left from another recipe, and didn't want it to go to waste. I remembered a friend once lamenting that she couldn't ever make whipped cream - it always turned to butter! I never realized how simple the process really is. Although it's so simple that little ones can make it, I'm pretty darn pleased with myself, all the same!

My family and I shake it in a mason jar I wouldn't have thought to use a blender or mixer...I like the idea of shaking it because you can really see the transformation and wasn't sure about rinsing it after I was just going to squeeze it using cheesecloth

This was great- a bit messy squeezing the liquid out, but worth it. I tried the cheese cloth, as suggested by another reviewer, which made an even bigger mess. I found it best to press with my hands- I'm always getting my hands in my food, I think they are two of the greatest kitchen tools:)  I added a touch of honey and orange peel to try to simulate some that is served at a fancy oyster restaurant in town ( though they also add Rosemary).  Everyone loved it, and my boyfriend said this one was even better than the restaurant's. Because it was for a holiday dinner I wanted to present it in a cute way, so I made little individual balls using a tiny scoop that everyone could put on their bread plates. I haven't tried molding or piping it yet. What I really like is that I can make a small amount of salted butter for bread because, being a baker I always buy unsalted sweet butter at the store so my baked goods are not too salty. Thanks!

Couldn't be easier and makes much better butter than standard American.    I used to make several batches on a weekend but then discovered Irish butter in the store, I can't compare to that with the ingredients available in my grocery store so now I'm sold on it.

I made it in my Ninja food processor with the plastic  blades.  Took a little over 5 minutes.
  
I used a 16 oz container of heavy whipping cream which I assumed was the same as heavy cream. Je ust poured it in  the processor bowl, turned it on, watched it get solid and the processor seemed to be slowing so I stopped it, poured off the milk. (I used the leftover milk when I made my buckwheat pancakes.}
Squeezed out a bit more liquid and transfered it to a small Tuperware container.
Came out great

I just love making homemade butter. To keep kids occupied while making dinner I give them a jar half filled with cream and 2-3 marbles in it and let them shake it, pass it around, roll back and forth and just go crazy. Just before dinner is ready I drain it, store the buttermilk for breakfast the next day, and use it to butter biscuits or rolls. The kids are happy to have helped (and in a big way; they made butter!) and I'm happy they stayed out of my hair. It's a win-win! 
*Note: be sure to rinse butter in cold water repeatedly until clear for optimum freshness and longer life

I was surprised at how good this turned out! I did use my hand mixer, and it worked just fine. I strained out the whey using cheesecloth and put it in a jar to possibly use in a bread recipe. The straining was a little messy but not too bad. The next time I'll either use one very large piece of cheesecloth for the whole amount, or have 2-3 pieces at the ready to if straining in portions. I already used the butter in sauteeing onions and on a muffin this morning. Thanks Brian for the fairly easy and very good recipe!

I used cheese cloth to drain the butter milk, not as messy and I used the buttermilk as a wash for fried raviolis.  :)

This recipe was amazingly easy and taste great! I used heavy whipping cream so it did take longer to make but the end result was fantastic.

Absolutely perfect!  Very easy to make.  Used my stand mixer on 8 and it took start to finish 20 minutes TOPS.  Very economical as well:D  Try it and you'll be hooked.

Loved this recipe, the draw back was liquid flying everwhere. I threw a dish towel over the mixer and it worked out fine. Will make again, the butter has a great taste.

What a cool way to use up leftover heavy cream!  Used my food processor and it turned into butter in no time.  My only tip would be to make sure that the cloth you use to strain the butter does not have any LINT on it!  Oh well, mistakes happen!

This recipe for homemade butter was not only fast but fabulous too. I followed the other reviews and strained and rinsed the butter. Thanks for sharing.

i cant believe how easy this was. i left out the salt, processed for 10 mins, drained in a cheesecloth lined colander w/ a bowl underneath to catch the buttermilk. i let it sit for 5 mins just to make sure i got as much buttermilk drained as possible. saved the buttermilk in a tightly sealed tupperware then rinsed the butter w/ cold water and let it sit for another 5 min. i did open the food processor to see what was going on halfway through but i dont recommend it because it spit some out at me and made a bit of a mess. am planning to use the buttermilk w/ some yogurt to marinade chix in overnight for oven fried chix.

So easy to make and the most delicious butter I have ever tasted.  Saved me from having to throw out heavy cream left over from ice cream.  Thank you!

I am so impressed with this.  It was so easy!  While I imagine that I will still buy most of my butter from the grocery store, I will be doing this again.

I learned in 3rd grade that butter came from cream when each student got to shake the jar with the cream in it. By the time we finished...butter! I'll never forget that, and the fresh butter is incomparable to anything store bought!
