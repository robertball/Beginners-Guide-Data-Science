Per request of my oldest boy, instead of a package of frozen mixed vegetables, I used a package of Birds Eye frozen corn. When I cooked the ramen, I left out the seasoning packet. I didn't want the tuna and noodles to be too salty as I was already using tuna and condensed soup which is pretty salty already. I just added a little pepper to taste. I made no other changes. Both the kids INHALED this. Then asked for seconds.

I'm not a huge fan of tuna, I did this recipe b/c it came up with ingredients that I had in my kitchen. It was pretty good. Not overly fishy. I think I drained of too much of the liquid from the noodles, but it was still good. I think it would also taste good with chicken...actually, in my opinion, better.

Worked well using cheddar cheese and 10 oz package of frozen peas instead.

I did 2/3 of the recipe, but probably should have only done 1/3. It makes more than I expected. Kinda weird. Anyway, I was unsure wether I was supposed to use the chicken flavor pckgs in the noodles. After it all cooked, I added one flavor pckg. It was good, but I thought it needed a bit more. I added most of the other one as well. Then it was much too salty. Next time I will probably use just about 1 1/4 of the flavor pckgs. Everything else about the recipe was very good! It was exceptionally easy and fast. Next time I will use canned chicken instead of the tuna. Think it will be perfect!

This was such a great, easy to make, CHEAP recipe! I had everything on hand...well, kind of. I didn't have frozen veggies, so I used a can of mixed veggies. I also didn't have 3 pkgs of chicken ramen, but 2 and a spicy chicken. I put only one chicken seasoning packet in the water/noodle, then pour off all except for about a cup of broth. I then added the 2nd packet to the noodles. My husband likes spicy, so we divided it and he put the spicy packet in his and loved it. I crumbled whole wheat saltines on top. It was just like a casserole, but you didn't have to use the oven!!!

CHEAP AND EASY PANTRY MEAL- I USED 2 CANS OF CHICKEN INSTEAD OF TUNA- SODIUM IN THIS RECIPE IS HIGH- I MADE A VERY BIG MISTAKE- I INADVERTENTLY GRABBED GARLIC SALT INTEAD OF GARLIC POWDER- BIG MISTAKE!!!  REAL SALTY- NOT RECIPES FAULT-  MY HUSBAND AND SON SAID THEY LIKED IT IF I COULD HAVE TAKEN OUT EXTRA SALT- THIS RECIPE IS WAY SALTY ENOUGH- LIKE I SAID FOR WHAT IT IS- CHEAP AND EASY- IT IS A GOOD RECIPE-

This was pretty good. I used co-jack cheese because thats what I had on hand and asian style frozen veggies. Next time I think I will add some chili garlic sauce and maybe a bit more cheese. This is filling, quick, easy, and cheap so you can't beat it with a stick.

So simple and quick in a pinch, but so good. My kids love it. I sub the cream of mushroom for half cream of chicken and half cream of celery. Also, sometimes I use canned chicken rather than tuna.
