This is different. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I just don't know if I like the combination of milk and whiskey, when it isn't eggnog. I mean, it's like it's trying to be eggnog only with irish creme. I think I'll wait another couple days and make another one and see if I like it.

Yummmm... But then again I'm a natural redhead.  My other half (who is not) also liked it.  I just added a pinch more milk and a few more cubes.

Just what I was looking for for a New Year's Eve cocktail!  Pretty strong so one did it for me.  I thought I'd have another, but after the champagne toast at midnight, I don't think I'd better, lol!

I've made this twice now, just realized I never reviewed it. I typically don't care for alcohol mixed with dairy but this is nice. It tastes 'light', maybe because it uses milk instead of cream or half&half. If you like your drink to be creamier, I would use that instead. Nice night cap!

I thought this was pretty good. I was worried that the whiskey taste would be a little strong, it is a tad, but it does get lighter as the 2 ice cubes melt. The Irish Cream, cinnamon, and milk combo is great though. I could just mix them together. I will try it with less whiskey next time. Edit Note: I did try making a second one and did 1/2 oz. only of the whiskey and it was much better.
