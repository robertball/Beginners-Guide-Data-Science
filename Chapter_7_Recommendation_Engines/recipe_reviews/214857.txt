I've made this a few times now, and I think overall it is a very good dish. I serve mine on top of wild rice, and with green veggies. It is extremly easy to and quick to make. I no longer use oil to cook my chicken in, instead I actually use water which keeps the chicken very moist, and cuts a few more calories off of the meal.

Wonderful & how much easier can a sauce get? I had homemade pesto in the freezer to use up and quadrupled the recipe so I could put sauce over our bow tie pasta too.  I also added about 1/4 cup lemon juice to perk it up and set the green color.  Hubby is not a big pesto fan, but he really enjoyed this, which says a lot-Thanks Philly!!

This sauce is awesome, Philly actually has a similar recipe for salmon.  I used white wine instead of chicken broth, it turned out great!

This was really good...I too had my eye brow raised when there was no garlic in recipe. Make sure you season the chicken or else you'll end up with a tasty sauce with bland chicken. I added 2 tbsp of white wine to deglaze skillet. I also recommend doubling cream cheese and chicken broth if you want extra sauce for pasta, rice, etc.

This was the best meal that I've cooked so far. I highly recommend making this for dinner.  I melted mozzarella on the chicken before I poured the pesto sauce and it made it even better.

It was delicious with some pasta on the side.  Make sure you flatten the chicken a bit to make cooking it faster and easier.

SO AMAZING. I rubbed some seasoned salt and pepper on this before I put it in the skillet. Very moist and the sauce was SO DANG GOOD. My husband said it was the best he had ever had.

This recipe is simple and tastes good.  Perfect for lunch or dinner in the middle of the week.  I made the sauce and tossed it with pasta and chicken.

Easy, quick, and delicious.  I used fat-free cream cheese which did not fare well on medium heat.  I tried it again on low and it was melted in about 2 minutes.  Turned out great!  I would advise doubling the recipe.  It was so good we topped our broccoli with it along with our two chicken breasts.  Every drop of sauce was devoured!

Very tasty served over rice. I did add onions and sauted them before adding the chicken. I used home made pesto and doubled the sauce. I may have added a bit more pesto then in the recipe but I found it to be perfect. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious!! I have made it a few times, with the latest accompanying with pasta.  I think it is best over rice, but just my opinion!. After the chicken is done, I slice it and toss back into the sauce for even coverage. mmmmmmmm

We loved it.  I used fat-free cream cheese, melted on a very low heat stirring constantly, and it came out nice and smooth.  I approximated amounts, and probably doubled the pesto, as we love pesto, and used less chicken broth, as we like a thicker sauce.  Rubbed the chicken with pepper and garlic salt before grilling.  I had the leftover cold sauce with raw carrots the next day.  That was good, too!

This was ok. Seasoned the chicken prior to cooking but still seemed a little bland. Would not use chicken broth again as it was pretty salty.

I made this last week. The sauce was a hit, but not sure if sauteed chicken is the best way to cook the chicken for the recipe. I found mine to be tough and plain. The texture of the chicken did not seem to compliment the amazing sauce. May want to try a different way to cook the chicken, to make it more tender. May also want to try and flavor the chicken More...Either way, my family loved the sauce. IT was a big hit. I may take some other suggestions of trying it with salmon.

This recipe is the best. I make it all the time. I am so glad I found this recipe. I usually make it with whole wheat pasta and sometimes add in sauteed mushrooms. You can make the sauce thicker by using less broth. Either way it always turns out awesome.

Such a great dish!
I found that it need some sort of sauce however so in a seperate pot I added some butter, then add flower and slowly add milk. Then add some and more milk while stirring. Add cornflour if you need to thicken. I think the sauce really adds to it!

Also I added yellow and red peppers (I found green too bitter), diced chilli and broccolli.

It tastes exactly like an itialian dish I get at my favourite restaurant and costs a whole lot less!

I've already made this 3 times in the last 2 months! We love it. I made it the second time with my homemade pesto and it was just wonderful. But the store-bought pesto is pretty good too.

This was so simple to make and really yummy!  Best of all, had all the ingredients on hand..I used chicken tenders, put them back in the sauce (which I had doubled) and added steamed broccoli to the chicken and sauce, too..served with wild rice..This will definitely be a regular dish in our dinner rotation!

I had some left over pesto from another recipe and made this sauce with it. Did not include chicken...just pasta and it was so tasty! Not super healthy so I won't make often, but as comfort food...this is a delicious sauce! I think if I were going to make a meal of it again, I would include some chicken pieces in the pasta instead of pouring over chicken breast.

Yum! This will be added to our regular rotation for sure! I kept the original sauce (with the exception of doubling) and chicken and then made a few changes from there.

Though the sauce and chicken were delicious together (which is what my 5 stars are for), for anyone interested: I cut the chicken up and then tossed it with the sauce, penne pasta, and broccoli.

I love it! Tasted before I would even think of saving to my recipe box.  I cooked the chicken in olive oil infused with onion and used garlic scape pesto from our garden. Topped with a bit of shredded mozzarella as another chef suggested. Yum.

This was soooo good, we didn't think it was bland at all. I sprinkled garlic powder on the chicken before cooking. I served it with angel hair pasta and a salad. It made a great meal but next time I will double the sauce as there wasn't much.

I made more sauce than the recipe called for and simmered chicken chucks in it until rice was cooked. The only change to the sauce was a squirt of lemon juice as some one else recommended. The hubs said it was delicious!

My Girlfriend and I make this recipe at LEAST once a week. With both of us being on a diet this is a fantastic recipe to really enjoy without worrying about calories too much. We love it just the way the recipe is. But we have taken to adding a can of drained mushrooms to the sauce and we cook the chicken with some garlic salt. We make enough on the weekend for a few lunches at work. AMAZING with white rice and steamed broccoli! Put the sauce on EVERYTHING! Too simple not to try it.

So fast and easy! Absolutely delicious and even the little ones loved it! Definitely double the sauce. I even made enough to freeze the extra; if it thaws well, I will have a 10 minute dinner.
I served over rice, and seasoned the rice with onion, garlic, and a sprinkle of Italian seasoning.

Delicious! Perfect amount of sauce for 2 chicken breasts. Used white wine instead of broth. Sprinkled kosher salt and pepper, garlic before cooking chicken. Would be good tossed with some pasta as well but would double the sauce.

I made this recipe 3 times, once as the recipe stated and then with different additions/substitutions.  I have reviewed it with a 4 start, as is, but would recommend: Adding some type of spice which would kick it up - paprika, a tad of cajun seasoning, etc.  It is a little bit bland as written.  Also, I think you can make it even more healthy, by adding some vegetables.  I added brocolli the first time and mushrooms, brocolli and peppers the second time and both were delicious.  I also substituted low fat sour cream one time, as I did not have cream cheese and found it very smooth and very tasty as well. Very nice dish with the additions.

FANTASTIC. This is so good, so quick, and so easy! My family keeps asking for it! I do double the sauce, because my family wanted more after I followed the recipe the first time.

Very good and soooo easy! I did salt and pepper the chicken before putting it in the skillet. I think next time I will put less pesto in the sauce. It was a little strong but thats just a personal prefence. Overall a wonderful recipe.

This was really good! I didn’t have any broth, so I used white wine instead. It had great flavor! I served my chicken over rice pilaf with summer squash. I also added spinach and cherry tomatoes to the pesto cream sauce at the same time that I added the wine. It was really good!!!

Yum! I actually made this with salmon (seasoned with garlic salt and basil) instead of chicken, and it was delicious! I made roasted cauliflower and carrots and also some jasmine rice. It isn’t a ton of sauce, but it was enough to drizzle some over everything.

Hubble and I loved it. Used combination of cream cheese, couple tbsp of sour cream and threw in a bit of shredded parm. Wow a real crowd pleaser I’m thinking when entertaining.

It was absolutely delicious! I made a few changes:  I added the remainder of my chicken egg wash (2 eggs & milk) to the sauce plus lemon juice & fresh Garlic with 1 chicken bullion cube and 1 cup of water.   For the chicken I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of flour.

Absolutely delicious!  I did season the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  Then I made extra sauce and served it over wild rice.  I took the advice from another review and cut up the chicken before putting it the sauce.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe for a weekday meal and my husband loved it! I cut the chicken into medallions and seasoned the chicken with garlic and pepper before cooking. I subbed white wine for chicken broth to cut the saltiness and doubled the sauce recipe. Great over rice with the chicken! Yummy.

Great recipe! I made the mistake of lightly seasoning the chicken, and I won’t do that next time. The flavors from the cream cheese, broth and pesto are more than enough.

I loved this!  Incredibly easy to make, too.  I cut the chicken breasts into strips and put the strips into a bowl with olive oil, salt, pepper, granulated garlic and red pepper flakes.  Sautéed the chicken, removed from the pan, and made the sauce in the same sauté pan (doubled the recipe).  Then, put the chicken back in the sauce to warm up.  Served over brown rice.  Really good flavor!  Will definitely make again.

This is a wonderful chicken dish that takes no time to put together.  As a personal preference, I cut the chicken breasts into medallions and breaded them before sautéing them.  I used my own homemade chicken broth for the sauce which  was delicious and creamy and perfect served with rice.  This is a great  quick night meal.

Wow! First time cooking with pesto and LOVED IT! This was so delicious. We served it over jasmine rice I prepped in my Instant Pot. I did use Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese since that’s what I had in the fridge. And baked instead of on the stove top.

I love this dish, it reminds me of a local dish I had when away on holiday to Bulgaria.

If you want you can add a little more flavor (spice) to this by switching the Red Pesto for Chili Pesto and/or putting some ground pepper in the sauce.

Goes great with some side veg like Broccoli, New Potatoes, Asparagus and Cauliflower.

PS: Also works well with a white fish instead of Chicken.

I suggest making this similar to the angel chicken pasta in this website. No need to cook chicken first. Simply season it well, and place in a baking dish. Heat the sauce through until cream cheese is melted and pour over chicken. Cover and bake at 350 degree for around 35 -40 mins. I'd also recommend added a little more pesto, using white wine instead of broth, and topping with Parmesan or asiago cheese before serving. Sliced Cremini mushrooms on top of the chicken before adding the sauce might even take it to a new level!!

Made my own pesto and cooked the sauce separately so everything was ready at once. Very good and rich! Served with fettuccine and garnished with chiffonade basil. Art complimented the sauce several times. Oh, do double the sauce if you wish to serve it on pasta or rice, too.

Yum!!! So easy and so different than our norm.  Will definitely make it again.  I did double the sauce so we were sure to have enough for each bite of chicken as well as a bit over the wild rice I made as a side.

Unbelievably easy!  I made it as written using homemade pesto that was 1/2 basil, 1/2 parsley.  YUM!  It was very good - thick, rich and filling.  It seemed like it could have used a little acid, like wine or lemon, to lighten it up a little.  It's definitely going on my rotation.

Quick, easy and yummy! Definitely double the cream cheese and chicken broth, we ran out of sauce. Next time I will season the chicken and try little wine also.

I am rating it 4 stars becuase I did make some additions/changes. First, I cooked the chicken in 2 tbsp olive oil. I seasoned the chicken with season salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and italian seasoning. After the chicken was cooked, I scraped the pan to remove the scraps and left the remaining seasoned oil in the pan. I added the cream cheese, broth, and pesto (all doubled) and stirred with a fork constantly until a cream sauce formed.  I served over pasta with the chicken sliced and topped with grated parmesan. It is a very tasty and fast recipe.

Great recipe. My very picky 2 yr old killed it!! My older kids asked for the leftovers for breakfast. I used regular low fat cream cheese instead of the spread and added onion powder and a dash of cayenne for a little kick.

I enjoyed this recipe, mostly because I don't think you can go wrong with cream cheese or pesto.  I did add extra cream cheese and pesto to the sauce for more flavor and to make enough to really coat the top of the chicken.

I made this with wild grain rice as others suggested as well as adding white wine along with chicken broth. And fresh green beans sautéed with butter and garlic on the side. Turned out terrific, family loved it. Next time I will add the lemon to the sauce for a little zing.

This is a keeper!  Even my husband who is not a pesto fan went back for seconds.  Next time I will season the chicken lightly during the saute (garlic & pepper).  For my pesto, I used this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/spinach-basil-pesto/detail.aspx.  FABULOUS!

Stan liked it but it gave him a stomach ache. Kids liked it ok, but not a favorite. I had added some garlic salt and I thought it was too salty.

Quick and easy. Tasty too. And, if you fib on some of the ingredients - adding more or less - you still come out with something that tastes great on chicken.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled the sauce.  Family (husband, 2 boys 14 & 10) loved it. I made a small amount of pasta for the side and put approx. 4 TBLS of sauce on it.  Yummy!!

Amazing!  Delicious flavor and so easy it takes minutes to prepare.  Whenever I serve this (which is weekly) there is a rare period of silence at the table.  With a 6yo, 4yo and 2yo it's almost impossible to make something EVERYONE including the adults love.  I tried fat free cream cheese once and it was harder to get it to melt nicely.  We stick with 1/3 less fat now.  I also double the sauce and serve with pasta.  Amazingly delicious.  Never any leftovers.
