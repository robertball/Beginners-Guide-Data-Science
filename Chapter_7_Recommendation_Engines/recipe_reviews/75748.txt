EXCELLENT!  Just what I wanted: a basic mac salad recipe.  I would recommend mixing the mayo and mustard together and then slowly adding to the macaroni, to your taste (I am very particular about the amount of dressing on anything).  I used the leftover mixture for deviled eggs and my mac salad was perfectly dressed.  This is my new, official mac salad recipe!

Grand Slam Mama!  After reading the reviews, the only changes I made were decrease the mustard to 1/4 cup, add 4 Tbl apple cider vinegar with 2 Tbl sugar,and a tsp of mustard powder, mixed in 5 chopped hard boiled eggs and 3 sliced eggs on top of salad.  In my opinion, it really does need all 3 cups of mayo--I started with 2 cups and then had to add the third. I rinsed and cooled the noodles before adding to the dressing. I will keep this recipe forever. I am taking it to a saint paddy's potluck tomorrow. Yo mama knew her stuff!

Not a single thing changed, and it was fantastic! I had never made Macaroni Salad before but found myself with a half a package cooked after making Mac n Cheese the night before. This turned out wonderful, with a nice kick to it. No weird ingredients -- all staples. Every time I had tasted Mac Salad before, it had no appeal because it was so bland -- this I (and my co-workers) loved. My partner does not care for mustard, so it wasn't a fave of his, but he was the *only* one to say so. *Everyone* else -- about 5 people -- loved it! This is the recipe you've been looking for. It will be in my cookbook for years!

I've made this twice. I can't save it to my recipe box as written because the preferred version is my second attempt at making it with revisions as follows: 
Less mustard- 3 Tbsps. and the type I used was a German, whole-grain dijon style. The addition of sweet red pepper relish in place of sweet pickle relish. Chopped in 1 medium red onion instead of the small green onions called for (store was out), and only 1 cup mayonnaise mixed with 2 Tbs sugar and approx 3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (I suggest the vinegar be "to taste" as taste preferences vary from person to person). I kept the black olives (used jumbo size) but stuffed them with jarlsberg cheese because it together with the olives somewhat mimics the sweet/bold taste of the salad. I actually really liked that olive touch!! Thank you for providing me with inspiration to try a new type of pasta salad!

This was excellent.  I was searching for a macaroni salad to serve with dinner but didn't want the same ol' thing.  So I found this here and it was wonderful.  My husband and I love it!

This recipe turned put a little dry for me, but I loved the mustard in it.  I will try to make again to see if it can turn out a little less dry.

I made this as written and even the kids loved it. I would rate it a 4.5. I still felt it was missing something and I couldn't pin point what it was. It was also a little dry for my tastes.
I'll make it again and maybe doctor it a little to find what I thought was missing.
We didn't think there was too much mustard but then again my family loves mustard.
Thanks for sharing.

The ratio of mustard to mayo was too strong.  I'd cut back on the mustard!

I used Diva's changes: decrease the mustard to 1/4 cup, add 4 Tbl apple cider vinegar with 2 Tbl sugar, and a tsp of mustard powder.  My son who is a big mustard fan, still thought it was overpowering in the macaroni salad, so next time, I'm skipping the prepared mustard, and using a bit more mustard powder.  Also, I halved the recipe, and it still yielded 8 generous side dish servings.  Overall, this is really a great recipe that I'm happy to have on hand for my son's favorite side dish!

This is really good!  I had some leftover crabmeat & shrimp from another recipe so I put that in.  I also cut down the mustard to 1/4 cup & it turned out delicious. Thanks Kalley, this is a keeper, with or without the seafood.

This was pretty good but a little bland for my taste. It is very simple though. I added a little bit of boiled eggs to make it a little different taste. Very good!

So similar to the way my mama taught me to make macaroni salad.  Only change (for health and taste) is sub 1 cup NF plain yogurt for some of the mayo.  I also season with some celery seed and tiny bit of cajun seasoning for just a bit of heat.  Just like mama's!! Thank you!

Should have read previous review before I made.  The ratio is off - might be okay if you cut back on the mustard.  Tastes like macaroni in mustard sauce.  Won't make again...

This will be a regular side dish in our house. The only changes I made was used 1\2 cup of mustard, used dill pickle relish plus cut up dill pickles, and used pasta shells. Thanks for posting!

Dry, dry, dry and tasteless except for the overwhelming taste of  mustard.  I was embarrassed to serve it, but I put it out anyway hoping no one would notice that I was the one who brought it.  Noticed that people were putting salad dressing on it - any kind.  This is a huge zero.

Turned out great for a graduation party.  The colors begged to be ate.  Did add a little more paprika, since I made a big dish, but everyone enjoyed and there was none left.  Thanks for the post.
