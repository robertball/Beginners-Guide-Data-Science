Unique, delicious take on a pot pie. I didn't quite like it with the puff pastry crust, but I put the filling into a freezer pie crust and put another pie crust on top and I couldn't get enough!

Added less of all the spices because I didn't have peas and made a smaller batch than the recipe asked for. Paired with homemade tzatziki.

This was a huge hit with both my daughters...one who is vegetarian and the other who isn't.  Will definitely make again!!!
