This recipe was very good and simple to prepare. Here's 2 suggestions - don't make this in a blender or you'll have to do it in 2 batches.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and it worked well.  I beat the eggs first, then added the remaining ingredients and beat it on speed 5 (medium) for about 2 min.  Also, remove it from the water bath immediately upon taking it out of the oven or it will overcook while you think it is cooling.

My husband is half Cuban and said that as far as taste and texture goes, this is as good as he remembers from his Grandfather or Abuela. 

I, too, really liked the taste and texture. It was very smooth and creamy and was the best flan I've had by far.

The issue that I had though was with the directions being incomplete.
The recipe didn't indicate at what point or how you got the flan onto another dish or if it should be cooled first. And when I poured the hot sugar into a cold dish it quickly became hard and stuck in the bottom of the pan. So I would follow the advice of another reviewer and carmelize the sugar in the pan you plan to use or make sure you're swirling the dish you're baking it in while you're pouring the sugar. After you cook it let it cool completely before you transfer it to a serving plate. Which you can do by putting your serving plate on top of the cooking dish and then turn it over. Maybe those instructions aren't there because it is assumed that everyone knows that but I'm sure there are some that don't.  

Having said that, the instructions for carmelizing the sugar were very helpful and I didn't have a bit of problem with that. I would give this recipe 5 stars for taste and 3 stars for incomplete instructions.

I have another recipe I normally use for flan, but didn't want to use all canned ingredients because I had some cream to use up.  I tried this recipe and we really liked it.  Based on the reviews and by comparing to my normal recipe I changed a few things.  I only carmelized 1/3 cup sugar and used 6 eggs instead of 5 because I needed to use up some eggs. I used my immersion blender to mix it up - easier cleanup. I also find it easiest to carmelize the sugar in my baking pan - saves dishes and eliminates the problem of it hardening up too fast.  Just sprinkle the sugar all over the bottom of your baking pan and place pan on stovetop over the lowest heat setting.  As pan heats, sugar will melt and using hot pads you can tilt pan until it is all melted and a nice brown.  Remove pan and set aside to cool as you mix other ingredients.  I wouldn't use a glass dish for this because if your dish is still too hot, when you add the cold or cool ingredients, your dish may crack.  I always use an 8 or 9 inch steel or aluminum cake pan and set it in a 10 inch cake pan for the water bath.  One more thing...mine wasn't done in 50 minutes, so I loosely placed a piece of tinfoil over the pans, slightly tented and cooked an additional 20 minutes until my knife came out clean after inserting in the middle.  If you like flan, you will like this recipe.  Very yummy!!

I followed the recipe exactly and after 50 minutes, the top was dark brown but the center wasn't even a bit set--completely liquid. I am an accomplished cook, and have no idea what what went wrong. If someone can tell me, I'd like to know!

This was great!  I made two of them, one for New Year's Eve, & and one for New Year's Day.  They were big hits on both occasions.  I liked it because the ingredients were simple & basic, & the directions were specific & clear.  I found that the advice regarding melting the sugar was very helpful (I have burnt sugar before when I didn't pay close attention).  Everything came off without a hitch, except that I tried it in a blender the first time, but it was too full & ended up messy when I tried to pour it.  So, the second time, I just used a regular mixer & bowl & it was fine.  I also put the finished flan into the refrigerator overnight, so that it would set a little more & be cold when served.  Very yummy & classy!  Thanks, Beth!  (I'm making it again tonight for a baby shower tomorrow!)  :)

I made this recipe for some friends after we all came back from a trip to Mexico.  They said it tasted better than any of the flan we had in the restaurants there.  I used brandy instead of vanilla extract, and stirred a bit of brandy into the caramelized sugar at the end of melting, and that added a nice flavor.  I also used 12 ramekins instead of one large dish and they came out perfect â€“ I reduced the cooking time by about 10 minutes to accommodate for the smaller bowls.  Highly recommended!

The best flan I've tasted. Took me a few times to get the caramel right but it's fantastic and well worth the persistence to get it right. I took another reviewer's advice and used a big bowl and a mixer instead of a blender. I also fill one large pie dish and a smaller little casserole dish (like a single serving size) and it uses up the little leftover mix that I have. My mom usually takes that little dish home with her. She is a veteran cook and she licked her plate clean the first time she ate this. Also, I cook the small dish for the same time with no problems. I like to eat it cold so after I let it cool (it will be runny when you take it out of the oven but will set nicely after it cools), I put it in the fridge. It makes it easy to cook the day before a dinner party.

This is very similar to the Spanish Flan (my favorite). I'm from Chile and this is a very popular dessert over there. A tip to prevent sugar from crystallizing is to add a few drops of lemon (2-4) while stirring the sugar in the pan. If you don't want to worry about burning the sugar, it's best to use the "wet" method which simply means adding a few drops of water (10-20) to the sugar so the sugar will be all wet but still solid in the pan and stir it until it becomes liquid and brown. You don't need to use the lemon when you use the "wet" method.  Also, after you mix all the ingredients and pour the mix into a deep baking pan (like those for cakes), you place the baking pan on top of a "handless"  deep pot that is filled with water half way. Then, you place both in the oven and cook it as per cooking time. I used to use a tooth pick or knife to check for consistency/texture before taking it out of the oven. Once the flan is ready, you prepare the caramel as per above instructions and pour it over the cooked flan when you are ready to serve it (not before!).  Let it stand at room temp or in the fridge for about 20 minutes until the caramel is fixed to the top of the flan. I prefer to let it stand at room temp so only the top caramel will be solid at time of serving because it only takes a few seconds for the caramel to solidify. If still in doubt, check the recipe for Spanish Flan (which is the original) for detail instructions about the caramel. Hope this helps. :)

BETH -- thank you!!!  
I have been searching for a good flan recipe for about a year now. This is the simplicity I was longing to achieve.  This recipe, I have ranked highest above all.  It was easy to make and now it is a definite family favorite.  This is a true Mexican dessert.  (Anyone reading this..look no further - this is it.)

They need more stars for this recipe.  Ive eaten flan all over the caribbean and this one is by far the best !!  
I use only whole milk in this recipe and as one reviewer said Eagle brand sweetened condensed milk is really sweet I prefer Carnation brand. 

Also when I melt the sugar I use 1 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons water and 1 drop of lemon juice, this helps the sugar not harden as quickly so you can get it in your souffle' dishes or casserole dish and swirl it around before the sugar hardens.  This is absolutly the best flan recipe ever.  Thank You for sharing !!!

It was very sweet and smooth. I just used the typical electric mixer in the bowl. It worked fine. I thought the caramelized sugar would spread a little by tilting the dish after pouring it, but it did not at all. So, you really swill slowly to cover the entire plate evenly. It made the surface to be a little bumpy because I had it so unevenly. I baked in 13 inches tart dish, and it fitted perfectly, but I think I would try baking it in something a little deeper next time. Excellent recipe.
*************
I've tried less sweet version by adding one more egg, 1/2 each cup of Heavy Crean and Milk. I liked this better. And, this still fit to my same 13 inch tart dish...

This flan recipe is really good - it's restaurant quality!!!!  It took me 1-1/2 hours to cook it.  I will definately make this again, maybe even try adding some chocolate.  Thanks Beth!

this recipe is clearly 5 star and i followed the ingredient recipe exactly.  living in florida most of my life with it's wonderful latin influences, i have had my share of flan made by cuban and puerto rican friends over the years.  this recipe is wonderful!  i heated my sugar in a small frying pan with a little bit of water and i stirred it lifted above the burner when it started turning light  brown to control the browning.  i love the almost burned caramel flavor, which by the way is authentic.  i also placed my corning ware dish in half the boiling hot water bath before i poured in and spread the caramel and it spread very nice.  it turns really hard quickly and i have found it takes overnight refrigeration to melt it properly and for the flan to set. check for doneness of the flan with a toothpick and take out of water bath to cool or it will continue cooking. after refrigerating overnight,  i ran a knife around the edge before i put the serving plate on top and flipped it over.  tap the bottom of the bowl before pulling off.  i am not sure if this does anything, but it works for me and comes out every time.  the top which was the bottom should be brown and the luscious brown syrup will flow on to the plate so be sure to plate it with something with a ridge.  the top should not be brown while baking, just when flipped. (bottom)  it turns out so rich, smooth, dense, and creamy, much like a creme brulee except the caramelized sugar is syrupy.  heavenly!

This is fabulous flan! Better than restaurants! I solved the problem of the caramel hardening too fast. Put the pan of water in the pre-heated oven, and put the pan you will put the flan in, in the water bath. Then make the caramel and by that time the pan will be hot and the caramel will swirl just fine. I used a round corningware casserole. After the flan has cooled run a knife around the edge to facilitate unmolding. I baked mine for 1 1/2 hrs, I live at high altitude and things always take longer anyway. Bake the flan until it is well set and the knife comes out mostly clean. It continues to cook a little more after it comes out of the oven so if you bake it until the knife is completely clean it will be tough around the edges. I used my hand blender. Thank You for this wonderful recipe!

I'm very pleased with how this flan turned out. I had half of a condensed milk can laying around in the refrigerator so I decided to make this and cut everything in half. Well, I used 3 eggs. I am used to making my caramel in the microwave oven. It is SO simple to do it that way. The only thing you have to do is keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn. It will take 10-15 minutes or so depending on the power of your microwave. I put sugar and a bit of water in a pyrex measuring cup and heat it on full power until it turns amber. Very simple.

So quick, so easy and SO GOOD!!!  Just a few notes, I used evaporated milk instead of whole milk just because that's what I had on hand.  Worked out just fine.  Make the cream mixture first then set it aside to make the caramel, that way the carmel doesn't have enough time to set up hard before you pour the cream over it.  I used a plain wire whisk to beat the cream mixture so it took some work but turned out perfect.  I put a large loaf pan in the bain-marie and put it in the oven while it was preheating so the pan was nice and warm when I took it out to add the carmel and cream.  Baked for and hour and a half.  I read it over on the Mexico International page on this site that a woman there turns her flan out as soon as she can comfortably hand the pan so that's what I did.  I removed the loaf pan from the bain-maire and let it cool for about 10 mins on a wire rack, ran a small knife around the edges and inverted onto a platter.  Turned out perfect without a single drop of carmel left in the loaf pan, a creamy carmelized top on the flan and a beautiful little puddle of carmel all the way around the flan!

This flan is amazing! I've made it 4 times now and each time it was a success. Well, one time I used Eagle Brand condensed milk and it was much sweeter than usual. Personally, we love this recipe for the fact that it isn't overly sweet - it's just perfect. I recommend using the Carnation brand sweetened condensed milk as that seems to be less sweet than Eagle.

Tried it exactly as written, so very yummy.  I made another for a dinner party dessert and oops, not enough milk in the house, so I used Baileys Hazelnut coffee creamer instead, and no vanilla...OMG so really very delicious, I may never go back to the original.  Jd

This is the first review I have ever posted.  I was really nervous about making a flan but this recipe is so delicious and my book club raved about it.  The important thing that this recipe does not tell you is how to caramelize the sugar. On my first attempt I think I stirred the sugar too much.  I went on line and got instructions on how properly do the sugar.  For one cup of sugar add 1/4 cup of water.  Bring this to a boil.  Will take approx 8 minutes and then it will start to darken.  Don't stir just swirl.  When it was a nice amber I easily poured it into my glass dish and swirled it around. Cooked it in water bath , chilled it and it was perfect.

I've made many different variations, including an 'authentic' recipe passed down from someone's grandmother.  This one is by far the best!  It always gets raves from all sectors, too!
Carmelize the sugar in the pan you are are using or preheat the pan and swirl it as you pour it in to coat the botton.  But really, if it doesn't cover perfectly, it still turns out fine!
No variations needed but it is forgiving - one less egg, a couple extra yokes, etc... I do always go a bit heavy on the vanilla extract.  
Chill overnight to unmold easily (plastic knife around the edge then watch out for flying caramel sauce!), then let it sit at room temperature for an hour or so before serving.

I'm going to give this five stars, despite the fact that it split in two seconds after I unmolded it!  I think this happened because the dish in which I had made it was too deep (about four or five inches), making for a fatal fall to the serving platter below.  Texture and flavor (including caramel) were perfect! Followed recipe exactly (used 2% milk, along with condensed and heavy cream).  Will make again ... but will make in a shallower dish next time....

Yum!  Everyone (8 people) all loved it!  It is creamy and slightly creme brulee-ish.  It is not as sweet as traditional Cuban flan but is still plenty sweet.

As for it turning brown as some previous reviewers mentioned, that is normal.  When you turn it out onto a plate that becomes the bottom no one sees anyhow.  Also, when you take it our of the oven it is a very soft set which is also normal.  It firms up considerably once completely cool which takes several hours (at least 5 or 6) in the refrigerator.

Pretty much perfect! 4 starts only because of the cooking time and incomplete instructions. Here are a few tips! 

For the caramel - Adding about a teaspoon of water helps make sure your sugar caramelises evenly. Don't be too afraid to stir it - just use a new spoon each time to avoid there being sugar crystals. As the sugar cooks, make sure your flan mould is warm by running it under hot water and then drying it off - this helps spread the sugar. Use a tea towel between the pan and the bench. Once sugar is done, pour and swirl.

I used my kitchen aid mixer - beat the eggs for a couple of minutes on medium speed before adding everything else in and beating another 3ish minutes. I had a little mix remaining into my 24cm/6 cup glass round casserole dish.

I have an electric oven. I checked it after 50 minutes and it was still VERY liquid. Gave it 10 minutes, still too soft. 10 more and it was closer. 5 more and the knife i used came out with only a slight amount of moisture - Perfect. Total cook time of 75 mins.  

Once it's cooked, remove from water bath and put it into the fridge immediately. Again, use a tea towel to absorb some of the heat under the dish. Let it cool for at least 2-3 hours before trying to turn it out. I ran a knife around the edge and put the serving platter over and inverted the flan onto the plate. I did this a few hours before serving as I was paranoid about it not being right and wanted time to get to the supermarket just in case!

I got rave reviews!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit! I made it the day before with a few problems with the caramel, so here's my story.  I followed the recipe, but used a mixer not blender. Made the custard first so it was ready for after the sugar was melted (used a cup of sugar). Preheated the oven; had the bano de maria ready. Then the problems with the caramel started. As suggested I added 2 T water, but against suggestions stirred it. It liquified, but when I poured it in the mold it solidified immediately in a puddle in the middle of the mold.  I chipped it out and headed to the computer.  Found a YouTube video that showed me how to caramelize the sugar from start to finish.  I went back to the stove, used a 3 qt saucepan, didn't stir, was patient, and it turned out beautifully! I poured it into the mold, but the mold cracked! It was old and I think it couldn't handle the heat. I ran to the store and got a 10" metal cake pan.  That worked, the sugar caramelized perfectly, I poured the custard on top of the caramel, and popped it in the oven! I checked at 50 min and had to give it 10 more. After it cooled completely, I covered it and put in the fridge. Next day I took it out about an hr before dessert and let it sit. Just before I served it, ran a knife around the edge, flipped it over onto a plate, tapped the middle, and out it popped with all that beautiful caramel. Picture perfect, but I forgot to take a pix! Delicious!

A very good recipe with an excellent texture, however, if you let it cook until it looks set in the oven, it will be overdone.  Eggs should be cooked until the reach 180 degrees for a perfectly cooked texture.  I checked mine until it reached 178 in the center and then removed from the oven, letting it set the rest of the way from the residual heat.  It was perfectly set and absolutely delicious.  

Another tip-- if you want an easier time with the sugar, add a splash of water and about a Tblsp of corn syrup.  The sugar will still completely harden in the bottom of the pan but will be easier to handle as it caramelizes.

This is an awesome recipe for flan!!! It was easy to make and well worth it! It came out better than any store bought flan I've ever bought!!! The only thing I found out is that it needs to be cooked a bit longer than the recipes requires. I cooked mine for 20 minutes extra and it came out perfect!

It was my first time making anything related to flan and it was super easy! We were taking it to a friends for dinner so I used 6 disposable pot pie dishes to cook them in. They were a huge hit! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This Flan was awesome. Take it from someone who knows nothing about baking. Easy and fast. Only one word of advice make it the night before you need it,and to take it out properly heat the next day for about 1 minute on the stove top, take a toothpick and round out the cake along the sides. It will come out beautiful. EVERYONE loved it. Will def. make this again. Thanx

Turned out great despite all the warnings. The sugar had a very slight burnt taste, so be sure to stop cooking it as soon as it's all melted. I made the sugar last so that it wouldn't cool and be difficult to coat the dish. I did cook the flan about 70 minutes until a knife came out clean from the middle. Refrigerating it does help firm it up if you're worried about it not being done. Flip it out onto a serving dish before the sugar cools and hardens to the baking dish. I added berries to give it more color and flavor, making a sauce by simply smashing the berries with some sugar.

I can't believe I made flan! This recepie was easy enough to follow and is sure to impress any dinner guest after some Mexican cuisine. The caramel hardened quite quickly and did not spread as evenly as I had hoped but I imagine that was my fault rather than the recepies. I served it hot with whipped cream as well as frozen with strawberries the following day. Both crowds loved it and I will be sure to make this again when I can fit it in!

WOW!!!  I made this will all the ingredients as specified in the recipe - no substitutions.  I did, however use a couple of tips from reviewers which worked out really well, those being: 1) I used a nonstick cake pan to swirl the sugar in, that way I didn't have to try to transfer the caramel to a different dish. 2)I used a hand-mixer instead of a blender, which worked perfectly well.  I baked at 350 for 1 hour. When I took it out of the oven it was a golden, toasty brown but still very jiggly.  I let it sit on top of the oven still in its water bath for another 15 minutes, then put it in the fridge overnight. Despite the fact that it was still very jiggly, it was perfectly set up this morning. I "had" to trim the edges a bit so I got to taste it (we're bringing it to a Christmas dinner tonight) and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The taste is incredible, the texture creamy and perfect...I can hardly wait for tonight!

Was looking for a gluten free but delicious dessert, so I decided to try this recipe for a baby shower and it turned out perfectly! The only changes I made were to increase the carmelized sugar to 2 batches of 3/4 cup (I increased the 2/3 to 3/4, but that still wasn't enough, so I repeated it...next time I'll do 1+ cup with some water) and to use almond flavoring instead of the vanilla. Everyone LOVED it--even people who didn't usually like flan! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is my favorite recipe for flan, and I don't change a thing.  It's easy to prepare in the blender, and tastes like heaven.  Everyone wants the recipe when I take it to a potluck.  It's still jiggly when it's done, but firms up when it cools.  Delicious!

I really liked the recipe but also felt it to be incomplete. The first time I made this dish the flan wasn't yet set so I let it bake some more. An hour to be exact. It ended up burned. But I'm not one to give up, and seeing as somehow the recipe got such great reviews I gave it another try. The second time I baked it for only an hour then let in refigerate over night. In the morning it had completely set and was absolutely perfect!

Made this for my brother's birthday and he not only had two enormous pieces, he ate it for breakfast the following day, and then again for dessert. The top browned quicker than I liked, so I took it out before it was completely set and let it continue cooking in the water bath. The texture was perfect. A tip about the sugar, though--make sure there aren't lumps before you start cooking it! I had a few lumps left when I baked it. It still came out well, but if you're a perfectionist be warned that lumps don't melt! And don't be worried that it will stick to the pan. Mine came right out with just a slap on the bottom, no breaking or sticking.

I have baked this flan almost a dozen times and every time people are blown away by the taste of it. Most people have said this is the best flan they have ever tasted and I agree. I followed some of the tips from other reviewers, such as burning the sugar right on the same baking pan where you are going to cook the flan, if not cooking individual portions. I also use 1/2 cup of sugar and that's usually plenty of sugar.  I do not use a mixer and that works well and the flan comes out fabulous. I also tried a mix of milk and cream and the best is 1 cup of cream and 2 of milk.  You will enjoy this recipe so much. One of the best ever.

This recipe is awful!!! I followed the  directions exactly as written. The recipe was incomplete! It did not tell me what to do after removing from oven (I had to look elsewhere for another flan recipe). I placed this in a 1 1/2 qt corning ware dish as directed. 60 minutes is NOT enough time to cook this. The top was a nice golden brown. I cooled completely and turned out on a serving plate. The center spilled out all over me and my counter. The caramelized sugar was a hard gold disc stuck to the bottom of my corning ware dish. I'm glad I didn't make this for company but my family was disappointed to not have the dessert they looked forward to all day.

I think it's little bit too sweet, thick, and weird taste, not like what i was imagine. i don't know maybe i made some mistake. maybe i should stir the egg first and than put the other ingredients. I bake for 50-60 minutes like what the recipe said and the top getting brown

I have made this recipe before and i decided to make it again today. Its very good but when i put the melted sugar in the dish it didnt spread so i put it on the stove to melt it in the glass dish some more when i put the glass dish into the water it exploded! SO today i learned that hot glass explodes if you put it into cooler water.

This recipe is so easy and insanely delicious!  My husband is Cuban and told me I could sell this in a Cuban restaurant!  I've made it twice, and this time I decided to make a lighter version (I used 1 cup cream and 1 cup half & half, and replaced the cup of whole milk with skim).  It turned out just as good as the full fat version...you can't tell the difference!!!  I baked it for exactly 50 minutes, and even though it was still quite "jiggly" in the middle I turned the oven off. I let it sit in the oven with the door cracked open for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes, I took it out of the water bath, put it on a plate, and placed it in the fridge for 4 hours...it was cooked perfectly!

Absolutely fantastic!  I made it for the first time today, for my Mexican Fiesta dinner party for eight people.  I usually try to make a recipe ahead but didn't get around to it this time, so I was keeping my fingers crossed the whole time that it would turn out.  I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed.  I did bake for a full 60 minutes, and next time may add 5 more mins. to set the middle just a bit more.  The middle should be jiggly but not wet.  The water bath is important to keep the custard smooth and velvety the whole way through.  I let it cool to room temperature, then put it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours to really set.  I pulled it out about 30 mins. before serving.  It was a hit.

This flan was a hit at my fiesta night - quick to make and it will be even easier the second time. I did stir the sugar while it melted against the contributor's suggestion because I was not able to get it to melt evenly. I was worried because I could not get the melted sugar to coat my baking pan evenly, but it turned out not to matter as the sugar melted again in the oven.

Turned out perfect. I did have to bake it for about 90 minutes though.

This was excellent!  My friend from Monterrey, Mexico was here visiting and I fixed it for him and he just raved over it.  Just sweet enough.  My first attempt at the caramel sauce to me wasn't enough to cover the bottom of the dish so I made a double batch of the caramel sauce.  I ran hot water over the pie plate and buttered the bottom of it too before I poured the sugar mixture in it.  I baked it about 20 minutes longer than called for.  This is better than any creme brulee I've ever had!

This is the base recipe I use to make flan.  I use all the same ingredients but instead of the 2 cups of heavy cream, I use I can of evaporated milk.  I also bake it in 8 separate custard cups.

I just made this recipe last night and it's sooo good. I LOVE it. I will be making this again and again!!! I did just put it in a round pan and bake it as is, instead of using a towel and roasting pan! Turned out just fine too!

I can't believe that anyone would give this recipe anything less than 5 stars!!! I made this in a large bread loaf pan so it required some additional cooking time (about 10 minutes). I covered the pan loosely with foil for the last 15 minutes or so to prevent burning the top. I made this twice in one day because the first one was devoured so quickly, I would give it 10 stars if I could!!! My 78 year old grandmother swears this is the best dessert she's had in her entire life!

The only reason I rated this a four is because I didnt really achieve making this recipe the right way and something always turned out wrong. If your not an experienced cooker than I would definitley plan on doing this recipe a couple of times before you plan on serving it. I learned that sugar can burn (didnt know that before; Im a novice). Dont worry about small flakes, just make sure that it turns a light brown and not too dark! The darker the more of a charcoal taste your going to have. The Flan itself was very good. I like my flan a little sweeter so I added a couple of drops of the vanilla extract. Im pretty sure its a five star recipe when done right but if your novice I would once again encourage you to do the recipe a couple of times before doing it! Tip: If you add some mint leaves and whip cream it tastes so good!

This was a big hit with my husband who says I can't do desserts! I found this receipe made 2 8" pies. If you use a good Calphalon non-stick pan, melting the sugar & cleaning up afterwards should be a breeze. I also used mixer to mix wet ingredients. Important thing: make sure you measure your pans first - you need to find a pan that is larger than the "pie plate" - I used a large alumnimum foil pan normally used for turkey.

I made this with my 12 year old daughter, our first flan and it came out great. We had so much fun, this recipe was so easy to follow I would recommend it to anyone. The one thing I do recommend is to remove the flan from the hot water for cooling, otherwise it will continue to cook.

This recipe was easy to follow, though instead of a blender I used an electric beater and a mixing bowl. The caramel was perfect, didn't burn at all like I was afraid it might. Texture was wonderfully creamy, though the condensed milk made it a tad too sweet for my liking. However, my mom found it perfect; she kept saying how good it tasted with each bite! I will definitely make this again and again!

This was great and easy to make. Made it for dinner party and everyone loved, texture on flavor was like my Argentine mother use to make. I made two separate batches. First batch followed directions and could not fit a third in pan due to foam. Second batch I let it sit for five min before pouring in pan and it all fit. Due thin 8" diameter cake pan I only cooked for 45 minutes. THIS WILL BE ON MY FAVORITE LIST AND HAVE SHARED ALREADY

I'm Hispanic and everyone loved this recipe.  I have another recipe I use but this one has a creamer texture. I would melt the sugar in the baking pans. The sugar could be reduced to at least 1/2 cup but it really depends on what size pan you're baking it in. You need enough to coat the base of the pan.

I ran out of cream and so I used 1,5 cup evaporated milk and 1,5 cups whole milk instead, for the 3 cups of dairy. It worked perfectly! I have learnt that for a silky smooth creme, it is better not to beat the custard mixture on too high for long. Rather use a low speed on the hand mixer until well mixed. Over mixing causes bubbles and that makes the creme spongy once baked. This recipe was a spectacular success!!! Thank you.

This flan never cooks in the amount of time the recipe specifies. My oven doesn't run hot or cold and yet this flan takes HOURS to set.

I am very picky when it comes to flans and I have to say this was by far the best... I mixed it in a Ninja Master Prep instead of a blender (less volume in the end). I cooked it for 55 minutes and it looked like it wasn't ready even though it looked like it was burning, so I let it cool until the following day (my mom's suggestion) and the end result was absolutely wonderful, it was the perfect consistency. I cooked it for Thanksgiving and the family has been asking for me to cook it again ever since.

This tasted amazing! I did what some reviewers suggested and poured the caramelized sugar into a hot pan so it would swirl easily. Followed the recipe to the letter, and I wouldn't change a thing!

The directions left out to many important details like the water bath to get 5 stars but we loved the flan and like most of the other reviewers I added extra eggs.

This was incredibly easy and very delicious.  Everyone liked it so well there wasn't any left.  Two comments: 1) if you warm the pan before you put the melted sugar in it, it will spread around more easily; 2) the photo shows a round flan but the recipe calls for a casserole dish.  The recipe made a little too much milk & egg mixture for my round pan so I had some left over.  It wasn't enough to make a second flan so I dumped it out.

Awesome Flan...My hubby loved it and went for second piece immediately. It was easy to make. I baked it for 55 mins and took it out and left it in the pan with the water for 15 mins then without water for 20 mintues before placing it in the fridge overnight. Thank you for easy, breeze recipe.

Took forever for the custard to set. I just covered the top loosly with foil to prevent burning the top and kept checking every 10-15min. Would use less milk next time. Good taste however.

This was a very easy recipe! Having a Cinco de Mayo dinner with family, I had to find a quick, easy recipe.  I agree with other reviews on a couple points, however.  If you can, carmelize the sugar in the same pan that you will bake the flan.  That being said, it was not an easy task to carmelize sugar.  I've never done it before and not sure what I could have done differently.  I finally changed pans from aluminum to an old nonstick 9" round cake pan, which worked much better.  Once that was finished, mixing everything in the blend was easy - but again as another reviewer mentioned, my blender was very full - tho not overflowing.  Mixing it in a bowl could work as well.  Also, regarding cooking time - mine cooked very nicely in about 50 minutes.  I was very pleased with my first effort at flan - and it tasted great!

This recipe is amazing! So simple that my 12 year old daughter made three batches of it for our Cinco De Mayo party and they all turned out wonderful. We used a hand mixer instead of blender. The sugar melted wonderfully, you just have to keep a close eye on it, and get it to the bottom of your dish quickly while it is super hot.  I used one oval 2-quart dish, one 9x13 pan, and an 8x10 pan. They all turned out beautifully, but the 2-quart one was the prettiest of course. It took about 1 1/2 hours to cook them. They still looked jiggly when I took them out but they firmed up in the fridge. I had people ask for the recipe, saying it was the best flan they had ever had. My kids said it was delicious! This is definitely going to be a family fave.

Fabulous Christmas dessert.  It was very helpful to read the additional reviews.  I could not believe that the caramel would be soft and run down the custard - but it looked just like the picture. Today I tried them in individual ramekins.  THis recipe makes about 10 3.5 ounce servings.  I will unmold them this evening for dinner, hopefully it will just as good this way too.  I baked them for about 40 minutes (hopefully not too long?)

Who cares is its not a traditional flan?  It's absolutely delicious and, except for caramelizing the sugar, a breeze to prepare.  And the caramelizing is just a matter of standing at the stove and stir, stir, stirring until the sugar is a liquid-y golden brown.  We had it cold and the entire family raved about the dessert.  I just baked one for my granddaughter who's been bragging to her Spanish class about her grandmother's flan.

Halfed the recipe using 3 eggs. Used a hand mixer instead of the blender.  Turned out great.  I had to bake it a little longer almost 90 minutes, in individual ramikens.  Was great and will definitely make again!!!

I have made many flans with various flavors, but this is the best one I ever made. It was a birthday treat for a friend who loves flan and he thought it was really, really good.

This recipe was very good and simple to prepare. Here's 2 suggestions - you need to split it up for the blender or unless you have a big blender.  I had to split it up into 2 batches.  I beat the eggs first, then added the remaining ingredients and beat it on speed 5 (medium) for about 2 min. Also, remove it from the water bath immediately upon taking it out of the oven or it will overcook while you think it is cooling. I used 12 custard dishes instead of making it in the bigger pan I cooked it 50 minutes.  I took it out of the water bath and set it on a cutting board to and put in the refrigerator cool.  My husband  and kids loved it.

This is a great recipe - almost identical to mine, I use one cup milk and one can of evaporated milk instead of the heavy whipping cream, but everything else is the same. One common problem can be having an oven that runs too hot. If the temp is too high, you may burn your flan and undercook it at the same time.

This recipe sounded too easy to be true, but it came out perfect.  Instead of one large flan, I baked mine in individual soup ramikins in a water bath and covered them while cooking and they were the creamiest flan I have ever tated and my guests agreed!

I made this for a friend who always orders the flan if it is on the menu at a restaurant, and she said this is the best flan she ever had.  She is always bugging me to make it. It doesn't fit in my blender so I mix half at a time in there and then combine it in a bowl.  Very easy and very good.

I do not use a blender.  I whisk together (add 2 extra egg yolks) and pour through mesh sieve.  

This will come out PERFECT with no bubbles, etc.  

This is A+ recipe. 

Enjoy :)

For a smoother texture, i strain the custard before cooking and use less egg whites. Used 5 yolks and 3 whites. DO NOT MIX IN A BLENDER!!! That's considered a sin for making a flan. Flans shouldn't have any air bubbles in the custard or it will have a grainy texture after cooking. Mix the ingredients in a bowl using a spatula, not a balloon whisk in a circular motion. Traditionally, in the philippines, we steam it over the stove. Baking it takes a while and gets the tendency to overcook

Great Recipe,
I doubled it for my family lunch party, only thing that I changed was, used my Kenwood 5 quart food processor to mix all the ingredient. 
One thing I have discovered is, if you mix eggs and vanilla extract together , it removes some of the egginess from the final product.
Baked it for 60 minutes in waterbath at 180* Celcius, covered it with foil and the baked for further 20 minutes for complete bake.

This is wonderful! Thank you so much for this recipe. After seeing the amount of fat in the heavy cream (5grams per tbsp)I used half & half (3grams per 2 tbsp), 1% milk and reduced fat condensed milk and it was really, really good!

This is a good recipe. I normally use egg yolk only, I didn't know you can put the whole egg. But if you prefer smoother texture, I'd suggest exclude the egg white.

Too much volume for my blender, and my round casserole dish, also top got extremely brown before it was done cooking, which took 80 minutes. The over cooked edges were curdled, but center smooth and creamy. I should have taken it out sooner, but the reviews all said it took longer. Yes, hard sugar mass at bottom of casserole, but still had a lot of sauce. Will need to read other peoples comments more closely to fix next time. Otherwise, great!

I didn't think flan could be too rich, but this one definitely is. Because of the heaviness I could not enjoy it. It felt like it was 1000 calories each bite. It was also too soft. It barely formed into a mold. I think it would be better to reduce the heavy cream to just one cup. Then it might form better and will also cut down on the richness.

I rarely cook (unless it fits in the microwave), but I was challenged to make this for last Christmas, and it was amazingly easy and was a HUGE hit! I'm now getting requests for it!! I did three batches, one as listed, one with almond extract instead of the vanilla, and one with half/half vanilla/almond. All were VERY good!

This was the first time I ever made flan, and I was delighted with the way this turned out. It looked so pretty on the platter when I turned it out, and the texture was so lovely and velvety smooth. I think I could have eaten the whole thing by myself, but my mama taught me to share :)

I have avoided flan for years despite my love for this dessert. Well tonight I proved that I could make it! I thought I'd messed up royally because I just had a smear of crystallized sugar blob on the bottom of my pan. When it came out of the oven this golden liquid oozed out. It also only took mine 40ish minutes to bake. Good thing I checked. Thanks for boosting my confidence!

My family loved this!  It was really easy and tasted fantastic!  I baked it in a stone muffin tin, sprayed with olive oil.  They came out in perfect, single-serving discs.  I will definitely make this again!

I don't know what went wrong! We followed the directions to a 't', but it came out tasting almost buttery, with a texture like eggs. Will not make again.

I was really happy with the way this turned out, especially considering I forgot the vanilla!  I made it for my mom's birthday (she grew up in Puerto Rico and knows about good flan!) and she really enjoyed it.  Two notes that make me wish I had read more reviews before I made it - it overflowed from my blender (and its a larger one) and I used a 1.5 qt loaf pan and it just fit.  I had to cook well over an hour and it was still jiggly, but as many reviewers said - it set in the refridgerator overnight.  I look forward to making it again either splitting it up in the blender or using a mixer.

Great recipe.....came out perfect the first time. Only one recommendation. Make sure you allow the pan to cool completely before placing into the plate. I recommend placing it in the fridge for a while.

I made this Flan for a Mexican Fiesta party and it was a hit!!! Sooooo easy and absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Two things though; one, I ended up cooking ot for a total of 70 minutes and the second thing is be careful when you're melting your sugar...don't do it too long because it can actually get a "burnt" taste to it.

I made this flan for a friend from Puerto Rico.  He loved it!  I used a loaf pan instead of a casserole dish so it needed to cook an additional 10 minutes.  This really was so simple to make, and once cool, came right out of the pan.  Thanks!

Excellent! I tried 3 of the other Flan recipes listed in this website and by far, this is my favorite one (so far). Didn't taste "eggy", the texture was good and the method with the water "bath" yielded a much nicer flan all around. It wasn't too sweet either. Where it calls for 1 cup of milk, since I only had fat free, I used a cup of "evaporated" milk.. I think next time I'll use 3 cups all together of the heavy cream. Nice recipe.. thanks!

Amazingly good and amazingly easy.  Friends and family keep asking for it to the point I had to try and make it lower fat if we were going to keep eating it!  I have successfully made it using whole milk in place of the cream (i.e. 3 c of whole milk)and didn't really notice a huge difference. I will continue doing it this way from now one and not feel as guilty! :)

This was a HIT!  However, I had challenges with this recipe as with another in getting it to firm after baking.  I am beginning to think it may be my oven.  Anyhow, I made this for 26 adults last night and it was a HIT!  I will defintely make this again.

wasn't really crazy about it, I used half and half thinking it would turn out great, for one the custards wasn't as sweet as I would like it, and it's not very creamy, next time I will use heavy whipping cream, maybe this would have made the difference...but my caramel was exquisite...

This turned out great.  Instead of 2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup milk, I used 1&1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1&1/2 cup 2% milk.  I also only had 1 tsp vanilla...it still turned out perfectly fine.  I omitted the caramelization of sugar step and just used store-bought caramel and used that as a topping/glaze.  Took to a party...it was received well.

To me, this tasted more like a Creme Brulee.  But it was tasty.  It was super thick and super creamy, which made it hard to eat a lot of at once.  Also, I ended up burning the sugar before I put it in the pan.  I think it should have been a little less "dark brown."  I don't know that I'll make this again, because it was so thick and rich, and I'm really the only person in my house who likes flan.  I think I'll stick with Jello Flan.

I didn't give it a 1-star because the reflection of the image on the caramel was very appeasing. I didn't give it a 3-star because it tasted like poop. literally. I fell and ate  and it literally brought me right back to that scenario. Poop-mouth diarrhea  flan.I didn't give a 4 star because then that'd make me a liar and i only tell the truth. By the way , the flan was .  I didn't give it a 5-star rating because only Wolfgang Puck deserves that kind of rating,

Perfect recipe and my family loved the pudding! Thank you for sharing  such a wonderful recipe. The only thing I might change the recipe is adding a table spoon of water during making caramel, because once the pudding was done, the caramel was  hard and stayed on the bottom of the pan. It's just a tiny thing and still the recipe is so perfect!

Beth I can't thank you enough for such an amazing recipe I mean really I am not hyping up anyone here. To tell you the truth I don't even write reviews but this recipe is so good that I was compelled too! Ok, now I made some changes like most of us do. Instead of 2 cups of heavy cream, I just added 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of Evaporated Milk. now for the blender (overflow) issues some people are experiencing. By eliminating the 2nd cup of heavy cream it reduces the amount of volume caused by the rapid blade movement. It is best to start on low speed for a minute then adjust the speed to a higher setting. The liquid batter will fill a 8-9 inch cake pan perfectly. Adding the evaporated milk gives a more authentic taste.  It truly is one of the best flan desserts I have ever had! Fresh whipped cream and hazelnut or almonds take it to another level! Enjoy!

Great recipe.  No eggy taste, not overly sweet and proper creamy consistancy but flan like ( not creme brule).  Made it twice but the second time I replaced some of the cream with milk and I won't do that again.  

As to the sugar I mix in water and allow the sugar to disolve while it boils.  Once the water boils away then the sugar will caramelize.

Awesome!!!!!!!  I baked it in a Bundt pan next time will bake in pyres casserole,dish. Mit took longer than 50 min about 90 min.  I sprayed the pan first, mixed the ingredients in my kitchen aid. 

Indont know if it's because I baked it in Bundt oan, but there didn't seem to be a lot of caramel on top.  No biggie.  Everyone loved it.  So smooth and creamy, not eggy tasting. 

IHave another recipe that's calls formthenevaporated milk instead of the heavy cream. This one is better!

I didn't have the right baking equipment, but made it anyway in a 2-qt chef's pan pan (Calphalon 142) immersed in water in a 3-quart saute pan (All-Clad). I was also making this for 2 people, so I changed the serving size to "3" so that it was exactly 2 eggs. This serving size was perfect for my standard sized 6-cup blender! I didn't have any trouble with the sugar: I measured out all the ingredients into a bowl, mixed it, and then dumped it in the blender (could have and should have just done that in the blender), THEN turned on medium-low heat for the sugar on the stove. While the sugar was heating up, I began blending, making sure to lift the sugar pan and swirl it around every so often. When I finished blending, the sugar was beginning to liquefy, so I lifted it off the heat a few inches, and swirled it around my chef's pan. Once the sugar was a beautiful medium amber, I turned off the heat and swirled it around the pan while it continued to cool. Once it had partially set, I dumped in the flan contents from the blender, placed the chef's pan in the saute pan, poured water that I had boiled while doing all the rest into the saute pan, and stuck it into the oven and baked for 50 minutes. It turned out perfectly... but did not flip well, because well, it wasn't baking equipment. All I cared about though, was flavor and texture, and that was spot on! Next time, to make it a little lighter, I will try using 1:1 cream to milk proportions instead.

Th texture, the taste, the difficulty (or lack of) are all great. The only thing I thought was missing was a complete set of instructions. After you take the flan out of the oven, you need to take it out of the water bath immediately. Also, to take the flan out of the dish, I find it easier to let it cool completely before running a spoon around the edge and flipping it onto a plate. Apart from that I loved everything about this recipe.

Came out AMAZING! I decided that I didnt want to use a blender and I'm Happy I didnt! Mine came out smooth with not one bubble whats so ever. I also made extra sause because I liked it that way. I was also glad i made extra sause for the botom dries and crystalizes very easly when its cooking and i lost bout half of the sause from that. Overall with the changes I made, I am VERY pleased with this recipie (:

Important: This recipe forgets to tell you to use a dull table knife to loosen the flan around the edges and then invert it onto a plate when it's slightly cooled. That's how you get it to look like the photo.

I make this all the time. My children beg for it. It's a little hard to determine when it's set, and it really depends on how big your dish is, but it is fabulous once you figure it out. I usually make two or one and a bunch of small ramekins.

We recently ate at a Cuban restaurant in south FL, and my BF didn't like the flan there because it wasn't as good as "mine." This recipe is "my" flan.

Best flan I've ever made! I've made it a few time already and the first time I made it, the top browned too much so I started covering it up with foil. I take the foil off when there's about 25 min left to bake so it can give it some color. My hubby and mom love this flan. My mom even told me to throw out the other flan recipes lol :)

So yummy! It is a fairly simple recipe, although it took me two tries to get the sugar right... It also took over an hour in my oven for it to set. So, if anyone freaks out that it isn't set in 50 min, just keep it in for as long as necessary! I checked it every so often with a toothpick, and when it came out clean, voila! Perfect!

This was great tasting flan. However, I had to adjust the bake time. I had to bake it for about 1 hour 20 minutes. It still didn't appear to be set so I allowed it to cool and put it in the refrigerator over night. The following morning it was set and great tasting. I'm going to try it again and try baking it in two 9 inch glass pie plates in an attempt to fix the baking problem. Also, many other reviews were right, it's too much liquid for the blender. It spilled over. I'll try using the mixer in a bowl next time.

I made this Flan yesterday. If you watch the video that comes with the recipe it's very helpful. I actually forgot to add the cup of milk and it was still awesome. It's the best Flan I've ever tasted. I WOULD cut back on the sugar and use a more shallow dish. This will help with the cooking time. I put the dish in the oven to make it warm while I was cooking the sugar and it worked great for coating the dish but you will have to let it cool before pouring in the milk mixture. I will never use another recipe...EVER!

Amazing! First time making this and it was so EASY I don't need to even look at the recipe again! Made it for a Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I actually had to make two badges and well I love vanilla so I added a teaspoon of that. And it was delicious! :-) highly recommend and it was so EASY!

I found this recipe and decided to try it for a get together. I mixed the ingredients in mixer and didn't use the blender. I made this in a 10 inch pyrex pie pan and then put the pie pan in a roasting pan with the water to bake. I read the other reviews and decided to cook it a little longer- 1 hour 15 minutes. It turned out great. Thanks for sharing this recipe...I will make it again.

My husband and I love it!  For the caramel, I suggest prepare more sugar for covering all the surface of your container evenly. First time when I made it, the sugar cooled down so fast that I didn't have time to let it flow over.  I ended up making more sugar to cover it.  Tip is pour your caramel when it boiling (watering) and once you pour it into the pan, swirl it as soon as possible to make it even.  It's definitely worth trying this recipe and you'll love it!  And it's so easy to make!

I substituted the heavy cream for half and half, the milk for skim milk and the condensed milk for light condensed milk after trying the original recipe once. I found that it largely tasted the same for less calories. If you go further though it affects the texture. 

I used a mixer instead of a blender and it worked perfectly. I beat the eggs on high for 2 or 3 minutes so they don't end up in clumps. I also mixed the rest in and continued to mix on medium until I was ready to pour it so the ingredients don't settle. 

I found the easiest way for me to get the sugar right was to not pick it up before pouring it into the dish. If you pick it up before you are ready to pour if thickens and you can't get it to evenly spread. Just leave it on the stove and shake it once in a while to spread the sugar out. Once the edges are melted and the inside starts to brown then shake vigorously to stir the rest until it melts and then set back on the stove for 20 or 30 seconds to get it nice and hot before pouring.

I found it takes about 90 minutes to cook or the center will not set. The instance where I cooked it for 50 minutes the center did not set even after 2 hours in the fridge. I was however able to cook that one again for a full 90 minutes (it was cold) and it set fine the second time and tasted fine.

It is baking now and so far it smells marvelous! The recipe was simple and quick.  Watching it done was most helpful.  This is my third try at flan.  The first attempt was a powdered Goya box of flan. The taste was good but that was it.  Then I tried a recipe I got from  MSN recipes (years and years ago) and it didn't bake all the way through but it tasted good.  So with trepidation yet curiosity and just orneriness, I watched Beth make flan and I also used a blender (good strategy!) and this was the most promising.  The glitch this time was that my baking pan has a leak the size of a finish nail in the bottom!  So I caramelized more sugar and poured the remainder into a glass pan.  The old metal pan is on the scrap pile now. I think I will not have any further trouble with flan. I would like to try different flavor extracts over time.

Oh man! Step 1, make sure you like Flan!!

I've never had this before, and while it came out good, this stuff is a sugary mess! And this from a person who regularly drinks soda, and enjoys sweets!

I'd never tasted a flan before, much less made one, but I decided to try it since I like trying new foods. I liked it, a little too eggy in texture, but it was alright if you got enough of the sauce. A Spanish friend of ours liked it, so it must've had a semblence to the real thing.

I don't know how many times I made this or was requested to make it. My bf used to hate flan.  He only eats this flan. There are some Mexican relatives that totally would wait for me to show up at family event to eat the flan. I don't make any changes to it. It's perfect. Thank you for sharing.

This flan was delicious!!!!  This was my first time making it, and it still came out perfectly!(:  I was really scared when I was making the sugar for the glaze, and I thought it was burning the second I put it in the pan.  So don't be scared.  It takes a good 3-5 minutes for it to have burning potential.

Made it for the first time and the people at the dinner we attended raved!  I did use the Carnation sweetened condensed milk, and it was just perfect.  I baked it just about 55 minutes.  I only had a 9 1/2 in. pie pan, so I used that, and it was fine.  I hope to find a cake pan next time for a better shape, but otherwise, it was great!

Very good Flan, instructions are easy to follow and its tasted heavenly. This was my first time making Flan and it was the best that I've ever tasted. My family loved it. The only thing the recipe does not say is after it comes out of the oven. I let mine cool down on a cooling rack for 20 minutes then I put it the fridge for up to 2 hours before I served it. Overall great recipe! Loved it!

A great and easy dessert to make, I used small ramekins for individual desserts.  

Try warming them with hot water (then dry with paper towel) before you pour in the Caramel (to keep from cracking the ramekin and allow the caramel to coat a little better.

Cooking time is also shorter (maybe 15 min less) with small plates.

This is my favorite flan.  It's been made a few times now and people love it and ask for the recipe. I had no problem mixing it in my blender all in one batch.  Blend on low and don't think you need to run the blender long.

I made this flan for my boyfriend a couple weeks ago.  It was so simple to make--my first flan attempt.  It turned out absolutely delicious, creamy and perfect.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an easy and impressive dessert!  Yum.  I'm making it again tonight.  :)

I am not an avid flan fan myself, but my BF is entranced by it; so I made this recipe for him. He LOVED it!!  I had heard that flan was hard to make, but I found this recipe very easy to follow.   I used a hand mixer which worked fine, but I think a blender would've provided a more velvety texture.  I did not have the recommended casserole dish, so I improvised and baked the flan in my egg poacher pan from C&B.   It turned out really well. I think I removed it from the pan a little early, because it was loose enough that it cracked when I served it. (I was pushed by an excited BF to try it)  Very good recipe!

I tried this recipe for a Bunco get together and it was a hit. All of my gal pals loved it and even a few husbands were impressed. ;) I did mess up the sugar on my first try, but it came out great the second time. I also used my Kitchen Aid as opposed to a blender. Just make sure that you have a large/deep enough serving dish as this is a messy recipe. Messy, but very yummy.

Just to stress how delicious this recipe is, I want to tell a quick story:  I live in a house of 60 and last night we had a special dinner where I got to try to experiment with this flan.  I pre-measured all of the ingredients and had everything super organized. It was so organized and pretty looking that I ACCIDENTALLY PUT the 5 CUPS OF SUGAR IN THE MIX,-(in addition to all of the 7 cans of condensed milk!)- when they were supposed to be for the caramel sauce . I Freaked out but decided to bake the flan(s) anyway, excluding the caramel, of course. Well, it was a SUCCESS. My dessert was presented last out of three sweet desserts and people still LOVED it.I got many great comments. I could hardly believe it.   I am really excited to try this recipe without the ton of sugar IN the mix, but rather in a delicious caramel.

I've made this twice. The second time it took me a while to figure out how to get the flan out of the dishes I used (I stuck a knife up the side and then it plopped out). The first time I served it warm and the second time cold; I liked it better warm.

I thought the taste of the custard was great and good on its own.  I was able to mix the full amount in a blender with little trouble, just be careful if you want to use this method.  There was a little bit of extra custard batter that would not fit into the pan but I saved it and used it two days later in a small toasteroven sized pan as a dessert for one.  Everyone loved it and I will make it again.  Next time I will use less sugar, it seemed like there was too much when I flipped the pan.  Also the cooking time was more like 2 hours but I used a deep 1.5 qt casserole dish so a shallower one would probably take the suggested time above.

This was really good.  The custard part is creamy and dense and there is no eggy taste. The vanilla taste was light and good but I might add a little bit more next time. The caramel didn't turn out right but I am pretty sure thats because I've never made it before, with practice I should get it right.  I think this might be a really good dessert to make for a dinner party.

This recipe is REALLY GOOD.  This is my first attempt at flan (though I've eaten it many times) and it's great.  My husband and I did add a little bit of brandy to it...GREAT recipe (even for beginners like me)!

Made this twice during holidays and everyone loved. Browned sugar in the pan the flan was baked in and only used 1/2 cup sugar.  Mixed flan with my mixer.  Added a few minutes to the baking time. Easy recipe.

This recipe deserves a 5 star.  It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, the texture was perfect, and the flan looked very appetizing.  With this recipe I won't have to buy my flan anymore.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe for flan! I made it a couple times and it turns out well. I did encounter a problem in the first batch. Try really hard not to stir the white sugar, it does turn to rock hard candy. The next time I made it I used a small nonstick frying pan and cooked it very slowly just until it melted. It pretty much turns a nice dark brown color. I was using my gas stove. It's easier to control heat with the gas stove. On the second batch, I used half and half instead of the heavy cream. There was no difference in taste. Next time I might try half milk then half and half. Just to cut fat and calories. Just a suggestion. Great recipe though!!!

I made this yesterday and it was delicious. It was my first attempt aat flan and I was little nervous because I was making it for some Argentians who always talk about flan. I dunno if the flavor was authentic but there was not a drop left! I couldn't believe how easy it was!

This was very sweet and tasted great, but the texture was kinda strange, like baked scrambled eggs. It wasn't as thick I was hoping it would be. It all fell apart when I dished it up. I don't know if I did something wrong or not. My husband doesn't like flan and he said he liked it much better than the mix I've used, in the boxes. All in all I would make this again, maybe reducing the milk a little or using a thicker milk. This was a good recipe though, I'm sure other people's probably came out better, and I just did something to it without knowing it!

My first time making flan... didn't like it. I'm sure the recipe is great, but I'm just not a fan of flan at all. It also didn't turn out very smooth - but pehaps I blended it too much, or not enough! Four stars b/c I'm sure the recipe is fine.

Is it normal for the top to be very brown while baking?  It didn't affect the taste, but wasn't very attractive.  Very thick and creamy...quite good.  I baked it a little longer than suggested, but it still wasn't quite long enough.  Even after refrigerating, the very center portion was a little runny.  Might have to make a few changes for next time.

Excellent easy recipe.  I use 1 C sugar vice 2/3 C.....some of the caramel always sticks to the flanera or other mold.  Good to have a little extra.  Also, the use of a finely ground sugar works better than larger grain sugar.

I have been making this easy recipe for years.  One problem this time.  Can you believe that Carnation has changed their standard for years , 16 oz can of sweet condensed milk to 14?  REALLY.  Hopefully it works out anyway.  No car to go get more.

Caramelizing the sugar took forever and I made way too much. Next time I'll just try 1/2 C. Turned out great. My sister requested I make it for her b-day and my pastry chef friend liked the texture and that it wasn't all sweetened condensed milk. I used evaporated milk like some suggested. Not really sure if it made a difference.

Absolutely delicious, made it as directed. Very creamy and rich. As a tip, I typically tap my baking dishes lightly to remove any air bubbles before I place it in the oven.

I make this every Christmas. Love it! So easy...once you get the caramelized sugar down. The first time I made it, it took 3 times but now it's easy peasy! Def use non-stick pan for caramelizing. It's not Xmas unless this is on my table!

Turns out beautifully!

A few tips I've picked up from other users.
1.  Melt the sugar in the dish you're going to bake in - I used a glass pie dish.  I find that mixing the sugar doesn't help too much.  Best to try an keep the temperature even by lifting the dish over stove burner and moving/swirling, once it starts to melt.
2.  Do the eggs first into the mixing bowl, so you can pick out any shells that accidentally fall in.
3.  Don't use the blender, use the mixer instead.  The blender makes the contents too foamy.
4.  I added just a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg, but not needed.
5.  Wait for the caramelized sugar to cool somewhat before pouring flan mixture over the top.  If I start the flan mixture after finishing the caramelized sugar, it is usually cool enough by then.
5.  To do the water bath:  Boil water on the stove in a tea pot.  Place the pie tin (with unbaked flan) on top of  water bath dish w/out water in it (I used a cookie pan with deeper sides).  Place it in the over w/out water in it.   From the tea pot, pour the hot water into the bath once it's already in the oven.  Don't try to move the entire hot water bath (filled) into the oven.

I put more vanilla in. In fact almost two tablespoons and I blend it for at least three minutes. Lastly I bake it for 70 minute without checking it out and it is set up beautifully.

I first made it an year ago and it was a huge success... everyone in the family loved it...i just made one minor change. Since adding 5 eggs was making the flan dense I reduced to 4 eggs....it turned out to be even more awesome!!! Try it u won't regret.

It was really good considering I have never made fall before. The only thing that was worth complaining about was when I took it out after eighty minutes it was just soup. Does anyone know how this happened? It might be just because I used a Kitchen Aid or my oven is broken.

Will make again. Best flavor ever in flan. Here are the tips I sent to my friendsAbout making the filling: 
1. maybe my blender is small, but my attempt to use the blender was a disaster. I had to start over, and clean the batter off the floor, counter, etc. (I wish my dog had been here.) I used a beater in a bowl, and at the end, a stick-blender. I poured it into the pie pan through a sieve. 

2. many recipes call for evaporated milk. Heavy cream tastes much better. I did use the one can of sweetened condensed milk. Instead of regular milk (which I didn â€™t have) I used 1/2 c. 1% milk and 1/2 c. half-and-half. I used  4 eggs. (some recipes use 3, some use 5).

3. I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 and 1/2 tsp of McCormick Rum Flavor. ( I donâ€™t think that flavoring tastes like rumâ€¦one would add it to the rum to get spiced rum or eggnog. )

About melting the sugar:
4. I put the empty pie plate in the hot oven so it would be hot to help spread the sugar syrup.

5. The instructions for heating the sugar here were the best I found. I used a whole cup of sugar, as in some other recipes. As you probably know, sugar is tricky. I didnâ€™t really stir the sugar at all. I sat on a stool at the stove, and watched it heat very slowly in a light-colored frying pan. When I saw darkening under the sugar, I moved aside a little of the sugar on the top, and, sure enough, I could see that the syrup was forming underneath. I just let it continue to melt slowly, lifting it off the burner and putting it bac

Had a little trouble with the sugar carmelizing and wasnâ€™t happy when I poured in the wet mixture but it turned out awesome good!  I did bake 65 minutes until it was set. Taste and texture was perfect!

This is THE Best flan I have ever made. I have now made it at least 10 to 12 times. And if I could I would eat this every day. I usually make this for thanksgiving or Christmas. I have had several friends and family requests for this.

My family loves this. I like it too, but it was too sugary for me or maybe Iâ€™m crazy. I got the caramel on my first try and you really have to take care of it. DONâ€™T LEAVE IT UNATTENDED. I then put it on a glass baking pan. It did get hard so donâ€™t be alarmed. I also accidentally put water in the mixture as I was adding the warm water into the bigger pan. Accidents happen and my flan luckily came out great. So I cooked it for an hour, but it was waaaayyy to jiggly so keep cooking it. Make sure your butter knife comes out clean when you insert it into the cooked flan.

Was lazy and wanted to make a flan that didn't require me to pull out 20 ramekins in order to please a family full of flan lovers, so I tried this recipe out.  Not used to using sweetened condensed milk and heavy cream in my flan, so I might be a bit bias, but it was slightly too sweet for me (I enjoy my flan on a more milky and eggy side, so I usually make a Japanese style flan). However, I still enjoyed this recipe. It was sweet, but not too sweet to scare me away.  Recommend this recipe for flan lovers!

Followed the recipe to a T. This thing is going in the oven for about an hour and a half (and counting) and still no signs of setting up. When I pulled a knife out, itâ€™s barely hot. How long do you have to bake this thing? Iâ€™m off to give the girls a bath and will check it later.

I took the advice  of another reviewer and melted the sugar in the pan I planned to cook the flan in. I also used two extra eggs to empty a carton. I used my mixer rather than my blender. I baked it for about an hour. The flan is creamy and delicious!  Bordering on the creme brÃ»lÃ©e side of flan. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

as per PP-i did keep my pan warm in the water bath -it helped with the caramel not hardening to the bottom.

I love this recipe! The flan is so tasty and actually very easy to make. Iâ€™ve  made it often and no matter what I always have to extend the cooking time 20/25 minutes. Iâ€™ve read other reviews about it not being ready in the allotted time and I just suggest testing the center of the flan by piercing it with a knife or fork around the recipes completion time. If is still liquid, really jiggly, and the knife doesnâ€™t come out clean from the center extend the time 15 to 25 minutes. The top will continue to brown darker but it never burns. 
I use a gas oven and live at high altitude, so that might contribute to the slower cooking time.

I have made this flan recipe for my husband's birthday dinner for several years and it's always been a hit.  I have never added or substituted a thing.  The video included was most helpful with regard to melting the sugar .  For me, that is always the hardest part.  My family was impressed that I made this from scratch, as well as enchiladas, Spanish rice and beans.  It doesn't get any better than that.  LOL  
Love this recipe just as is and so does my husband!

I followed this recipe exactly...and the center was not set after 60 minutes - or 70 or 75 minutes.  I was tempted to let it cook even longer, but decided the caramelized sugar on the bottom might burn.  The part that IS cooked is delicious.  
I'll try it again, maybe in a ring pan or bundt pan so I don't have to worry about the center setting.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times because we love it so much. I hate the skin that can form on top so I always cover with aluminum foil while baking. It takes 90 minutes in my oven-it's done when the edges are set but the middle is still pretty jiggly. I would recommend erring on the side of under-baking than letting it cook too long.

This classic version of flan is excellent. Do not worry about the sugar hardening before you pour the milk/egg mixture. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD. When you pour the cool flan mixture on top of the caramel,  there will be "cracking sounds", it's OK...it's just the caramel breaking. The sugar will melt completely once it gets hot in the oven in the water bath. Make sure to refrigerate the flan overnight  and invert it over a dish with sides. it looks really pretty decorated with a few red berries on top.

This is delicious and pretty easy.  Like the other reviewer, mine was not set all the way but I removed the bottom pan of water at 50 minutes, left it in for an additional 10 minutes and then found as it cooled it set on the counter. I would definitely recommend.

So if you're like me, you find a recipe and check out the reviews to see how your peers fared.  Let me quickly say that all of the reviews on this flan are right.  Yes, it is a no-hassle, minimal-effort recipe to brute force a creamy and delightful flan into existence.  I have one and I'm also eating it right now!  But it also might be super liquid in the middle after a full hour of baking.  Mine sure was!  

Slamming the oven door and setting the timer for another 30 minutes, I took to Google and found that this could be due to the oven not accurately reflecting the temperature, and that the heat inside the oven was not high enough to allow the custard to set.  I cranked it up to 375 for another ten minutes, then dropped it back down to 350, dropped a sheet of foil over it and gave it another fifteen.  It did form a wonderfully burned-looking crust on the top side, but all's well.  After basically an hour and a half, it was still wobbly in the middle but not pure liquid anymore.  Let it cool in the water pan on top of the stove for an hour, then stuck it in the fridge overnight.  This morning I had lovely breakfast flan.

A few other internet sources suggested that an un-set flan could also be due to too high of a milk:eggs ratio, and/or that plain milk doesn't belong in any flan recipe.  I might be tempted next time to half or omit the regular milk and try it with just the condensed/cream/eggs and see if it sets within the allotted hour.

I also slightly burned the sugar in

Well, the caramel was a challenge!!!  I talked to many other cooks and read most of the reviews... I ended up pouring the sugar right on the glass pie pan I was going to use to bake the flan.   At medium heat on burner the sugar melted wonderful and quickly and I didn't have to transfer it from one pan to another where it became hard so fast!!! Also, depending on your oven, I ended up baking the flan for 65 minutes... cooled and transferred to the serving dish (carefully).

I did twist the recipe a bid, used condensed milk instead of regular milk, and add it two tablespoons of coffee liqueur for an extra kick. Very creamy and delicious. Will definitely do it again. PS. make sure the Pyrex you are going to bake the flan is hot so when you pour the caramelized sugar it does not harden so fast... and you can make sure the whole bottom is cover.

This is the best, easiest recipe that I have ever baked.  You are the bomb! Tip! If you put two teaspoons of water in the bottom of your dish, the Carmel all comes out over the flan.

Almost on a whim, I decided to add flan to a small party. As a result I served this flan warm (I didn't have time to chill it). My family and guests loved this flan, some saying it was the best they'd ever eaten. It was very simple to make, and I'm planning to make it again soon but chill it the next time.

Awesome recipe. Expect to take about 10 minutes to get your sugar to caramelize. For a nice change, try adding freshly grated orange zest to your flan mixture.

OMG!!!!  2 comments.  This is got to be the most simplest flan recipe I have ever made!  I bought the boxed easy to make stuff, read the back of box and not much difference than homemade.  You still have to stir it on stove.  I found this recipe and decided to try.  OMG!  It was SO simple.  Everything in the blender and pour in baking dish and bake!  The first time I made it I forgot the milk!  It was sooooo creamy.  The second time it came out with the consistency of flan.  I have a big blender and everything fit in blender very nicely with room to spare for the blended liquid.  I am tempted to try 3 cups of cream and see if it comes out creamy like the first time.  I baked it for 50 min, but didn't seem ready.  Left it in oven the addition 10 min and it was still very funny and top look super brown.  After cooling and refrigerating it was solid like flan is supposed to be.  The very dark skin was good and didn't look as browned as when first removed and eventually placed in refrigerator.  To me, this recipe is easier than the premix boxed kind.  I will never buy boxed again, though you don't have to bake the instant you do have to constantly stir custard till ready.  BTW, I hate stirring custard on the stove till it is ready to take off stove.   Thank you Beth! ..................................   ....... ........      .... ..........   ....,....
.
UPDATE:. I have made this numerous times in the last 2 weeks.  It is still awesome.  One thing.  When I take it out of the oven

This was only the second time I ever attempted flan and it was delicious and very easy.  I made it exactly according to the recipe but baked in silicone baking cups for individual servings rather than using a large dish and it worked great!  The cups peeled away easily without sticking.  I plated them with 3 mandarin orange segments on the side, arranged  like a rooster's comb for a little fancier presentation.  The guests loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

Decided to try this on a whim making only enough servings for two (I had a tiny amount of sweetened condensed milk left in a can from another recipe and didn't want to throw the rest out). I was shocked by how amazing it turned out! I made two miniature ones in a muffin pan and wanted to die from how sweet and creamy they were!! Will definitely be making this again and again in future.

This is a family favorite! We love it!! It's so good! I don't use a blender I just use a regular hand mixer. I have not tried to flip it over with the fear of it falling apart, I am yet to try it though. I usually just flip it over when I serve people. But thank you so much for this wonderful and easy recipe!!!

This was delicious. I did add an extra egg just because our chickens are really cranking them out and I wanted to use a whole dz (I made 2 flans). I used 2 nine inch cake pans as molds. THIS IS WORTH NOTING: it took 2 hours and 45 minutes to bake! My oven thermometer showed the oven temp at exactly 350. I did not use convection. The only thing I can think of is that I was baking 2 flans, ea in a water bath but one on the top rack and the other on the middle rack. The top rack flan finished 15 min before the middle rack and I also tented it w aluminum foil for the last hour because it turned a deep gold and I didn't want it to get too dark. The flan on the middle rack did not turn golden but ea was done to perfection. I kept testing w a knife inserted near the center and removed ea flan when the knife came out barely coated. 2 hours and 45 minutes. After the initial hour of baking I kept setting my timer in 15-20 min increments. Both incredibly delicious. Just wanted to let you all know in case you run into the same situation. Keep the faith, it's worth it:)

First attempt by this recipe had an egg flavor. I divided the mix in two small containers so the first one didn't turn out well because I didn't let it cool. Second one I let it rest about 1 hour, put it in the fridge over night and it turn out much better.

Second attempt and all others came out perfectly!! I use 4 eggs only because the heavy cream has egg already so adding 5 eggs has made it taste like egg instead of Flan. I let it cool for 1 hour outside and then cover it and leave it overnight in the fridge.

For the water in the container be careful don't do like me and get burned! :) This is a very nice easy recipe. I wonder how it will taste if I add cream cheese!

This was amazing!  I made the caramel following the suggestion of making it in the microwave.  SO much easier - but you still need to watch.  I mixed the sugar with 2 Tbls water.  It was dark amber / burnt smell after 5 min, 40 sec.  Second try I kept a better eye on it.  Cooked about 5 minutes.  
This is an absolute KEEP.

If you want to cut the baking time, you can gently heat up the custard in a saucepan before placing it to bake.. The long bake times needed for a good flan test my patience :)

Took it to a friend's house for dessert  and everyone had seconds.  Very delicious.  We spooned strawberries and blueberries, that had a tablespoon of rum over them, onto the flan.  
The only issue I had with the recipe is I couldn't get the whole flan out of the pan even though I tried to do it exactly as the video shows.  Instead, I sliced it and served it like a pie on dessert plates.
I would recommend that cooks watch the video before making the recipe.  It does help to clarify some of the picky steps.

This is my favorite flan recipe. Years ago, I used it as a cooking project in a high school spanish class. I fell in love. I love how precise the directions are, especially about making the caramel. I've never used a blender for it, simply because I've never owned a blender, but a whisk works just fine.

Beware: this flan is ADDICTING.

Good recipe, I added Cacao wine to give a different twist (2 teaspoons). Also added 1/2 cup to sugar for the caramel (took longer for the sugar to caramelize but worth it).

At the end everybody loved it.

Added 1/3 cup sugar, 50% less than the 2/3 cup sugar in the recipe.  2/3 cup sugar in the recipe is too much sugar in my opinion.  My flan was in oven for more than 1 hour, but the middle was liquid.  My flan baked for about 2 hours.  The flan was dark brown on the outer top and a thick custard at eating time.  Tasted good, though.

Terrific recipe, easy to make. I used fresh eggs from the farmer's market the second time I made it, and the difference was unbelievable. Son-in-law flipped out over this dish.

I don't like flan, but my husband's family raved! I made it for my husband's family as part of a spread of my Abuela's recipes for our traditional Cuban meal.

This was my first time making flan - which I never really liked but did so at a friend's request. Since this recipe, I have changed my mind and would make it again.  It was light, creamy and beautiful. It had rave reviews at our New Year's Eve party.

This turned out really amazing as always. I have used the recipe a few times. I always make it the day before and chill over night then turn it upside down and the caramel just coats the flan and makes it so pretty. Always a hit with everyone.

I have made this recipe 10-12 times over the past 4 years and it is fantastic.

A lot of people find that the cooking time isn't quite "right" - but I will point out that the cooking time is hugely impacted by how hot or cold the "hot" water is when you start. This most recent time the water I used was ~ 180F.

I have found that if I use hot water, as recommended, it comes out pretty close to the recommended time, but if I use water that is closer to luke warm or even room temperature you are looking at probably another 30-45 minutes to cook.

On a side note, if you do happen to find that it didn't set when you took it out - just put it back in the oven. In one instance I had it in the fridge for 2 full hours hoping it would "set". I took it out and cooked it for about 2 hours afterwards (at this point it had to heat up from fridge temp) and it tasted great.

Hope this helps.

I followed the recipe exactly. It's been in the oven for 1 hour 20 mins now, and still completely liquid, not set at all. Waste of money and now I need a plan b for dessert for a party I'm throwing.

Update: I think there is a typo in this recipe. Instead of "milk" it should be "evaporated milk". That's what I'm seeing in other flan recipes. Please update if that's true!

I'm not sure what happened but I put the flan in the oven but it never set up. I put it in for extra time and when I moved the pan, the middle of the flan sloshed around. It never ended up firming up.

Awesome, best I have ever had. I cooked it for an extra 10 min let it stand for about 15 min then in the fridge until dinner was finished about 30 min.  It was still slightly warm in the center, perfect!

I rate this recipe 5 stars!!! Not only did my dad LOVE it!!, But it was also very simple to make!he loved the taste and the texture!
 I've made it twice this week! Though the second time I made it I divided the recipe in half and put it in the blender 1 batch at a time just so it could have room to blend, much easier and cleaner??I HIGHLY recommend it!

One person said theirs didn't set so I added an extra egg just in case.  Had a difficult time with the caramel, I hope it's better next time, it hardened too quickly and didn't cover the entire pie plate. It turned out fine after it was baked though.  The flan was awesome even though I did change it up with what I had on hand.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would, I've never made a flan before and I was worried I was going to burn the sugar, but it turned out absolutely amazing!!!!! This is a MUST try! I did not change anything about this recipe, I made it exactly as they said! Brilliant!

This recipe was spot on for a wonderfully flavored, dense and satisfying flan.  The only thing I had to change was the cook time, possibly due to the depth of the pan I used.  Otherwise, it's perfect and now my go to recipe for a cold summer desert that seems more exotic and time consuming than it is. Also, thanks for the suggestions:   Use a stick blender or just beat by hand, it's easier.

This was delicious once I got it made properly.  The instructions are lacking if you haven't ever carmelized sugar or made flan before. I also broke a pyrex dish putting the hot carmel and cold custard together so I recommend another reviewers suggestion of using a metal pan if possible.

Once I got it made it was a hit and has already been requested a second time!

This was amazing! The perfect amount of sweetness. My husbands mom is from Peru and he and she said it tops their recipe. I made it it smaller cup cake sized portions and loosened the sides with a knife &  flipped over before serving. The directions for carmalizing the sugars were perfect - be patient don't over swirl and don't stir and it will pay off!!! Have your mixture ready to pour though because once the sugar is ready to be poured into the pan you need to get the custard mixture over it IMMEDIATELY or else the sugar sets and gets hard like a lollipop!! 

It was beautiful and delish! Definitely adding this to my collection

First the directions didn't work for me aside from the cooking of the sugar. There is no way you put this in a 1 and 1/2 quart anything, it doesn't all fit and it's too thick to cook. Second, you need more then 1 can to get 14 ounces, it's 1 & 3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk (for 14 ounces), one can ( 300ml) is 10.175 ounces and is 1 & 1/3 cup. After 60 minutes it's a nice dark brown on top and still liquid, did you use a convection oven or conventional? I placed mine on the middle rack in a conventional and this is never going to cook through in that time and with that thickness.


I am stubborn so I tried again, I cooked this in a 2.5 quart casserole dish instead of a 1.5 so it was not as thick. It still was not set as of 1 hour (but not as liquid in the middle as the first attempt) so I took it out of the water bath and put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes on the middle rack and it finally set. I also used 1 can (10.175 ounces) not 14 ounces of sweetened condensed milk. My father loved it but my wife was not a fan of the texture, the flavor was really nice, not too sweet and nice and creamy. I think you need to adjust the water from 1 inch to maybe 1-2 centimeters instead, I think the problem is 1 inch of hot water is too much, maybe a convection can do it with that much but not my conventional oven. I would have given this 4 stars if the directions gave me the second attempt results.

I made this yesterday.  It was my first attempt at flan.  The custard part was really good, but I think I cooked the sugar too much, as it had a burnt taste to it and was shade darker than the pictures shown.  I will try again.

The 1st time I made this, the butter separated out and it also took a  long time to bake. The second time, I left the cream out of the blender and stirred it in after blending the other ingredients.  I also poured it into shallower pans, filling each to no more than 1-1/2 inches. It baked in an hour and came out perfect. So: don't blender the cream and don't fill your cooking vessel more than 1-1/2 inches deep.

This was really good. Everyone loved it. I made it in my kitchen aid mixer. It was a little messy with liquid flying out everywhere so I covered the mixer with a towel which helped considerably. I've never liquified sugar before and wasn't sure I was doing it right. It requires some patience for sure.

To avoid having the sugar harden in the pan, before you start melting the sugar on the stove place the water bath and cake pan in the oven while its preheating that way the cake pan is hot and easier to spread the melted sugar on to.  I added orange zest and turned out great. Next time I'll try adding lime or lemon zest. I mixed it all in my food processor with no problem as I thought it wouldn't all fit in my blender. Served this at family bbq and it went pretty fast. Great recipie thanks!

This has become our family favorite dish. when ever my mil has people over, she requests me to make this. I've made this for a crowd of 25 people. I also add canned fruit to this....I've tried peach&apricot, and tangerines (2 separate combos)

I've actually made it quite a few times and love it, the recipe is simple to make and to the point. 

I however, changed one little thing: Instead of using HOT water when placing the mixture in the oven, I use ROOM TEMPERATURE water. Why? Because when I place it in the HOT water it starts cooking the mixture before I even put it in the oven and in the end...I end up overcooking it. I don't know if anyone has had this issue, but if it has bubbles...it's overcooked.

This is a good recipe for flan if you like really rich flans... I feel that it is good but a little thicker consistency than I prefer, and the eggs make it really rich.  I plan on trying a recipe that has a couple less eggs and a little more milk to help lighten the flan a bit.

I've made this flan a few times already. I absolutely love it and so does my family.  
The recipe is easy to follow except for the sugar part. I still have a hard time getting it perfect. It is very hard when I pour it on my baking pan. But even though it hardens, I still pout the mixture over it and somehow it magically comes out perfect. I'm assuming it sets when it's baking. 
One thing, I have never made this flan within the time specified. It takes 1 1/2 to 2 hours to bake. Has anyone tried baking it at a higher temperature? But even with the longer baking time, it is still totally worth it. So tasty.

This was so good! I actually did a happy dance after I took my first bite. I added a little lemon juice to the sugar and I also made 12 individual servings instead of making 1 big dish. I used 6 oz. ramekins and baked them for about 40 minutes. I let them cool for 10 minutes in the water bath and then transferred them to a cooling rack. Once they cooled I wrapped them with Saran wrap and refrigerated them for the next day. They were delish! Thanks for the recipe.

I would suggest something bigger than a 1.5 quart baking dish, maybe a taller one, simply because I had a lot of my liquid mixture left over - close to a cup or two.

Very yummy.  I used 1 can evaporated milk and half and half to get the 3 cups of milk.  This was my first time carmelizing sugar and I think I burned it a little which gave it a bitter taste.  However, the custard part turned out really well.  I plan to make again this time not burning the sugar!

This was my first time making it and Everyone loved the recipe !!!! The only thing I changed from the recipe is that I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and I strained the mixture. I am Dominican and salvadorian and I made 2 batches for this past Christmas and everyone loved the flan. It was creamy  and smooth and it had no bubbles. My flan was in the oven for 1 hr 23 minutes.  Since this was the first time making this, I messed up on caramelizing the sugar, as I was pouring the caramel into my dish it was getting hard. I did the same as the lady in the video but then I saw this other Lady on YouTube actually mixing the sugar as it was being heated and it was crystallizing at the beginning but then as it kept melting it became liquidy. I found that mixing the sugar was actually better for me. So don't be afraid to do something that the recipe is telling you not to do. Trust me when I say everyone loved the flan!! :)

my gf sent me a similar recipe, except used 11oz can evaporated milk for heavy cream (+1/2c milk). 
and I increased sugar to 1 cup, as we love extra carmel topping.   I ended up melting in the actual  pie dish, then pouring in the custard. let sugar cool as you compile the blender ingredients.
 
let it cool completely (I stuck it covered outside in fall weather), then run wet knife through edges before inverting.  Addictively good!

This is my first time ever making baked flan. I don't have a blender (it went to blender heaven this past summer because my husband and I make and sell our own apple butter so it definitely got over-worked) so I used my mixer to blend the ingredients. I didn't have heavy cream so I made my own. I noticed the caramel hardened quickly before I had a chance to pour the flan on it. I have it in the oven now so I'm hoping it turns out. To be continued... lol

I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect.  I had an issue with my oven and had to leave it to firm up, like one hour and 20 minutes.  But I cooled it completly and it came out perfect, looked and tasted excellent.  Awesome recipe.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and it is a hit every time . It takes a bit of work to get the sugar carmelized nicely but is well worth the effort. Flan is creamy smooth , so easy to prepare, filled my blender full but not overflowing. Mexican vanilla makes this even better. May take a bit longer to cook. Check it carefully  Everyone loves this recipe!

We thought this was delicious!  I used a loaf pan and it took almost an hour and a half for it to set, so the top got a little browner than I would have liked it to but it was still excellent.  Wish the recipe had a little more direction about what to do after the flan comes out of the oven.

Great recipe!  Followed it exactly with outstanding results.  It filled the blender, but as long as I was careful to push the top down tight while blending, the mess other reviewers talked about didn't happen.  I had a little bit of a tough time with the sugar and since I was using a 10x10 square corelle baking dish, it didn't get all the way to the edges before hardening.  I put the dish on the stove to resoften it, and that helped, but there was still almost an inch around the bottom of the dish that wasn't covered with sugar.  I also, because the dish was wide, melted 1 1/4 cups of sugar.  The flan was only about 1 1/4 inches thick, but the sugar liquified nicely, the flan set easily, and the custard was super creamy.  Made it for a dinner party.  Everyone raved!  Thanks for a great recipe.

It was my first attempt making flan and I was very nervous. I made this for a Spanish themed meal and it was spectacular.I carmelized the sugar in the microwave and it is foolproof. Use the dish you plan to bake the flan in if possible. Add the sugar and just enough water to moisten the sugar. Set the microwave on high, it will turn from clear to golden in about 10 minutes. Do not stir or it will crystalize! Start watching it carefully after 5 minutes. If you use another container be sure to pour it fast or it will harden. When the flan is ready to serve put the pan in a little warm water bath and it will release easily.

This is a great recipe.  I followed the advice of some of the others that had made it before and it turned out very well. I received rave compliments.  The only thing is the baking time is way off. I had to bake it more than 1 1/2 hrs.

This was the first time I made flan and it came out beautiful!  It was only my husband and our son at home, so I made half a batch.  I mixed the ingredients in a bowl and electric mixer for about 2 min. Based on other reviews, I was concerned about the carmelized sugar hardening very quickly once poured.  This did indeed happen and the bottoms of my ramekins were not evenly coated and there were empty spots.  However, I poured the milk mixture over and baked and it came out perfect!  The carmelized sugar was nice and runny and covered the custard, no empty spots.  I used a knife to cut along the edges and inverted on serving dishes as soon as the remekins could handled (with oven mitts), about 10 minutes out of the oven.  I will definitely to make this again, and probably very soon since I have half a can of sweetened condensed milk sitting in the fridge!

There was far too much left in the blender for my liking because I do not like to waste. I had to throw a quarter of it out even when I used the right size baking dish. It was delicious though.

Easy to  prepare following Beth's directions.  Watching the video helped, too.  Only difference for me and her instructions was the baking time.  It took longer for the custard to set than 60 minutes at 350.  For me, it was closer to two hours. But the finished result was yummy.  I will make this again.

Yum yum! Instead of heavy cream, I used a substitute that's 2/3 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of melted butter for every cup of heavy cream. Also, I ditched the extra one cup of milk and the texture is perfect! Everyone loved it. Thank you for posting this recipe!

This was quick and easy. Beware, unless your blender is industrial size, this could be too much for it.  The only problem I had is that my family members couldn't wait for it to cool and wanted to eat it all as soon as it came out of the oven. That's a good problem!

Just made this and it's very yummy and easy to make.  I used natural sugar that may burned a bit the white sugar will visibly brown much easier than a tan colored sugar.  I also used the fat free condensed milk

I add about 1 1/4 c. sugar and just let it sit on the stove under med heat.  i shake it like jiffy pop at times just to get the sugar to disperse.  when all but a few crystals turn golden then take it off and be ready.  folks, there is no need at all for a blender.  instead of heavy cream and milk, just add a can of evaporated milk...why make the recipe harder than it should be?  i add 6 eggs instead of 5 maybe out of preference. a pinch of salt helps too. i also pre heat my round casserole dish in the water bath as soon as i turn on the stove.   it may take a few hands to pour the liquified sugar and then the egg mixture so be prepared when you do so.

My first time cooking this dessert and I have to say that it was D E L I C I O U S!!!! It tasted just the way i wanted it to taste. Texture was great. The only change that I made was that I added a bit more vanilla and sugar. 1 whole cup of sugar ( if it statrs to get hard because of not mixing right.. no worries it melts in the oven evenly).

This is an easy to follow recipe, I like flan but it's usually to sweet for me so for this recipe I used 3/4 of the condensed milk. It took a little longer to set about 25 minutes more but it came out delicious with a nice consistency.

Delicious flan that embodies everything that I love about this dessert.  The flavor and texture are wonderful.  A few thoughts, though.  There was too much batter for my blender, so I had to blend in 2 batches.  I used a 10" cake pan, which I placed in a large lasagne pan for the water bath.  I would like to try this in a different pan, because it was full to the tippy-top, which made it hard to put in the oven.  It was difficult for me to tell if the flan was done, and as a result, I think I over-baked it (I kept it in the oven for 70 minutes).  Next time I will use a skewer or a knife to tell if it is done, instead of looking for a wiggle.  The flan wiggled after 70 minutes, which got me worried.  Regardless, it tastes great.  I am very proud to serve this for dessert tonight.

Made it tonight. Simple and fabulous. Guests loved it. After an hour, couldn't tell whether it had set (slow wiggle when we poked the bowl), but when had to serve it, we were prepared for liquid. But it DID set, and it was great. Thanks!

This recipe was delicious!  I accidently bought condensed milk and had heavy cream left over from the holidays, so it was a great way to use up ingredients.  I made small servings in ramekins (placed in a large pan for the water bath), but it took much longer than the recipe called for.  The flan started browning so I tented foil over the ramekins and cooked them until a knife inserted in the middle came out clean. Turned out perfect!  It also didn't matter that the sugar hardened in the ramekins when I poured it.  Hope this is helpful.

I was very pleased with how this recipes ultimately turned out.  I heated the casserole I was pouring the carmelized sugar in, but it still hardened immediately.  I let it cool then proceeded pouring over the eggs, creams, etc.  Baked in a water bath and it turned out beautifully.  I made one small individual one as I had some left over.  We loved it.  The hardened carmelized sugar just distributed itself across the bottom as it cooked.

I made this for a Cuban bunko and I couldn't  believe it could be so easy so when I watched the video to see the end result I thought I would give it a try. It was absolutely delicious and so easy. Cubans approved. It highly! Now everyone wants the recipe!

This is a very good flan.  It has a nice rich texture.  You have to be patient melting the sugar, but otherwise it is very, very easy.  I mix the custard ingredients with a mixer not a blender.

I really liked this recipe of flan. I didn't feel it was complicated, tasted like egg, or that it didn't have enough flavor. Well, just me though I duplicated the amount of sugar to melt...I like sweats :)

This is the best flan I have ever made.  I prepared it exactly as the recipe said and I had rave reviews from my picky family.  I did bake it 15 minutes longer because I do all of my baking with duck eggs.

This is the best flan I have ever made!  I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and it was delicious!  Thanks to other reviewers who gave advice on how to complete the recipe: take flan out of water bath to cool; don't overcook, as flan DOES firm up when refrigerated overnight!  Mine looked very soupy when I took it out, but let it cool completely on counter out of water bath and then put in frig overnight and it was perfect, very creamy texture! Also, had a little issue with the sugar topping releasing from bottom of my glass loaf pan.  When i flipped it, most of the sugar had turned to syrup and streamed down the flan like it is supposed to, but I also had like a 1/8th inch layer that was completely adhered to the pan!  Took many rounds of soaking to finally be able to scrape it out!  Not sure what happened there, but still loved the flan- will make again!

I made this for a party and it wouldn't get done!  I used a glass casserole dish and believe the sides were too high.  After about 3 hours we decided it must be done and following the directions posted flipped it out onto a plate.  It immediately cracked in half - hence make sure you use something with only about 1 1/2 to 2 inch high sides.  The flavor was wonderful though, I will be making this again.

Pretty good. Used a pie tin and had extra left over. Put it in the fridge and made it the day after. Tasted about the same. Don't think I will make it again though.

I made this last week with my 15 year old son for a Spanish project.  I had it recalculate to serve 20.  It made SO MUCH!  I ended up with two casseroles full so I sent one with him and I took one to work.  He made a 100% and I am making another batch tonight for our work party tomorrow.  Everyone LOVES it!

I am pretty impatient so melting the sugar correctly was really difficult.  When I did get it right though, the recipe was delicious.  I poured them into little bakers cups and they were perfectly sized little flans.

The flavors of this recipe were great, but mine didn't quite set right. It turned out a little bit runny, but still tasted wonderful. I will try this recipe again and hopefully it won't be as runny next time.

I had never made flan before, but a co-worker asked me to try my hand at it for a farewell party for a fellow co-worker leaving to work in Mexico. This was amazing! It was the talk of the meal. And it was so easy. We found it nice and light, just enough sweetness to it and yummy. This one's a keeper!
