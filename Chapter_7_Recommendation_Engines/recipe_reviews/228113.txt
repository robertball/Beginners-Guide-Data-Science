I prepared this recipe exactly as stated, but, made corn muffins instead.  They took about 13 minutes in my oven to bake.  The muffins were moist and had a nice balance of sweetness.  For our taste though the flour to corn meal ratio was a little off.  Although the muffins were very moist - they had more of a biscuit texture inside.  My family missed the texture you get from the extra cornmeal.   I would probably try again, but, do less flour and more cornmeal.  I might even try it with buttermilk instead of milk.   Thanks for the recipe, Karen!

Oh man, this is so good. It's sweet, dense, and tender. It's great cornbread if you're wanting the type that's more sweet than savory. I did make a few changes as suggested by the users here. I used only 1 cup milk instead of 1.5, 1 cup sugar instead of 0.5 cup, 1 cup flour instead of 1.5, and 1.5 cups corn meal instead of only 1 cup. Reason being, I wanted more corn meal and less bread texture. Anyway, these are simple changes and the results are just wonderful.

I made this cornbread today using stone-ground red corn meal.  As suggested in one of the Reviews, I used 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1 cup flour and did not need the entire 11/2 cups of milk.  I thought it would be too soupy.  I did use up some half and half as part of the milk.  This is the most incredible cornbread I have ever made and I have baked a lot over the years.  I just have to stop nibbling on it or it will be gone by dinner time.

I had saved the link for jalapeño corn bread (which I have made several times and loved).  When I came here today to get the recipe for a friend, it wasn't here anymore ... the sweet corn bread recipe was in its place.  Needless to say, both my friend and I were disappointed.

Just made this exactly as written- OUTSTANDING! Baked it in an Antique Cast Iron pan with corn cob shapes. First time my corn bread has EVER come out of that pan looking as its supposed to. Nice texture, good crust- perfect for dipping in chili etc. Since we're not having chili tonight, I'm going to whip up some honey butter to dip it into!

Made it yesterday. Instead of all cornmeal, I used ¾ cup of canned sweet corn & ¼ cup of cornmeal. Came out moist & amazing! Best cornbread I've ever had :-)

Yum!  Really nice cornbread.  Was running low on butter, so used oil.  I was surprised to find that this is a relatively pourable batter compared to other recipes I have used.  Because of that, I could beat this batter more readily than some other batters and still no toughness.  This is a great first cornbread recipe for that reason alone - though it is a really nice quality bread as well.  I think that it would probably be hard to over beat this, though I'm sure it could be done. To help deal with my blood sugar issues, I have to use whole wheat and raw sugar, and this recipe worked wonderfully anyway!  Because WW can mask the flavor of corn somewhat, I used 1 1/4 C cornmeal, and 1 1/4 C whole wheat flour.  I measured slightly under on the flours, and slightly over on the milk so this would be less likely to be heavy or dry.  We may have also left it a bit undercooked.  Our 17 yo loves the heavier quality both from being slightly under baked (a bit damp still), and from the whole wheat.  He thinks that produces more substance to 'eat'!  Karen, your recipe adapts to whole wheat better than any other recipe I've tried to date.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I used stone ground blue corn and switched the corn measure with the flour measure. The corn bread came out very moist and was very enjoyable.  We are saving the receipe to use again.

The flavor of this cornbread is excellent but it came out a little dry. I baked it in an 8x8" pan for only 30 minutes (the low end of the suggested time to bake), and it was still overbaked. I'd recommend checking it for doneness after 20 minutes.

Quick, simple and incredibly delicious. Baked them in muffin trays for 15 minutes and they were perfect and fluffy.

This is a wonderful recipe. After baking it in an 8x8 square pan, the middle was runny and uncooked. My suggestion is to bake in a 9x9 square pan instead or just use muffin tins.

This is a soft, moist, cakey cornbread. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I didn't even use softened butter. I used fridge cold butter and made my KitchenAid beat it into submission. because of that some creamed butter & sugar was stuck to the bottom of the bowl after pouring it out. Still perfect. And on that note I really recommend using a mixer (stand or hand) to cream the butter and sugar for several minutes. Then do the same for each egg addition. It makes a difference in the finished food.

The smell of this in the oven, and the flavour upon completion takes me back to the days WAY back when my Mom used to me this as a side for her stew.  Beautiful with a crispy outside and moist inside.  Best served warm and with butter.

So yummy! Great recipe I've made several times already! My recent making I realized too late I didn't have any eggs! I substituted the equivalent of the eggs with apple sauce and added an addition 1/2 tsp baking powder. They came out great!!! Couldn't even taste the apple sauce! I like to brush melted butter over the top once they come out of the oven. So tasty!!!

I LOVED IT. I made some chili and decided to make corn bread. I made them as little mini muffins and have plenty of batter to make more. Now my mom won't stop eating them

Yum yum yum!! Got rave reviews by everyone at my BBQ. Would definitely make again! Moist and not too sweet. Perfect mild cornbread taste. I made mini loafs (each the size of 2 muffins) and baked for 20 min.

This was so so good! I was a little nervous when I saw how runny the batter was, but it came out prefect. I used a 8 inch round baking pan instead of square with no problems. I also used unsalted butter, which I think helped it come out a little sweeter. Will definitely be making this again!

This was awesome!  I used rice milk instead because I didn't have regular milk and I added a can of corn (drained) and it came out really well!  Perfect with my chili.

This recipe was OKAY. I would have added more sugar and the flour measurement is not correct. When I made this the corn mixture was way too thin. I have a lot of experience making bread so I knew it was much too watery and added more flour to it. Once I added more flour the corn mixture was much more thicker. I didn't add enough sugar, but the corn bread still came out relatively good. The bread didn't come out dry, very moist.

Made exactly as it's posted and I didn't like this at all. While the cornbread is very moist, I didn't care for the flavor or texture. It's very cake like and bland.

Did not make any changes this time, and it was really good, but a bit fluffy for my taste.  I am going to use the fat in flour method, and decrease the fluid a bit to get a more biscuit like texture.

Real good flavor and texture as is, but I just was looking for something a little drier and more biscuit like, less cake like.

I made this substituting yellow grits and almond milk (all I had in the house in a snowstorm.). My husband loved it, said it was the best cornbread he’d ever had.  Took him back to the lunch ladies’ cornbread in North Carolina when his dad was stationed there.  Definitely a win!

Made with almond-coconut milk, gluten-free baking and pancake mix (accidentally used just 1 cup), and instant corn masa flour. Turned out great and went very well with my chili. Super moist.

Awesome! I made this pretty as written. Except I used almond milk instead of real milk. Made this twice as muffins. Added a little more sugar to the second batch as I planned to serve it with honey butter. I may try this again with less sugar and add cheese and/or creamed corn. This will be a fun recipe to play with!

My husband loved this and he insists that he didn't like cornbread.   Also was enjoyed by a bunch high school students who at first didn't think they  would like it. I did add sweet corn from a can to half of the recipe.  I also warmed the  milk before I soaked the cornmeal.

So delicious! Added 1/3 cup each of canned whole kernel corn and shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Baked in muffin tin, had to pour extra batter into an 8-inch round cake pan. Baked according to directions; came out perfectly! Will definitely use this recipe again!

I made a half recipe to have with ham and beans. We had guests walk into our home and they said it smelled so wonderful- reminded them of Thanksgiving! I baked the cornbread in a bread pan for 30 minutes. Followed directions exactly, except for sifting the flour. I ground my own corn in my vitamix. Yum! This one is a keeper. I live in the South, so don't tell anyone I like sugar in my cornbread :-).

This is the best cornbread I have ever had. I usually find corn bread and corn muffins too dry & gritty for my taste, even when slathered in butter. This was delicious; more like a dense, moist cake. I only had a 9” square pan (versus 8”) so I baked at 375 degrees for only 25 minutes and it was perfect.

I did add some fresh corn of the cob (about 1/2 cup) in lieu of 1/4 cup of corn meal. It is a lovely moist cornbread with a hint of sweet.

Fantastic cornbread recipe.  Great texture, soft and delightful to bite into.  Warm out of the oven is to die for.

At last, cornbread that is light, flavorful but not too sweet and cakelike.  Simple too. I didn’t have milk so used 1 cup half-and-half and 1/2 cup water. The batter looked very thin but came out perfect. Best cornbread I ever made!

If you only knew how many cornbread recipes I have tried and thrown out!  I am thrilled with this one.  It is a keeper.  I did use the extra honey and corn as suggested in the video.  It tastes great!!

Per another comment, I swapped the flour and cornmeal amounts (more cornmeal than flour). Mine took longer than 30 minutes to cook.

No changes required. I absolutely love this recipe. I have a buttermilk recipe as well but, this will be my go-to recipe for all family functions.  It's sweet and moist. A perfect bread for a pot of beans or chili on a cold day.

I had to sub milk with half and half so I just cut it in half.  I would had a bit of honey to make it sweeter.  But it was my first time ever making corn bread from scratch  It was good.

Used masa instead of cornmeal, also used cake flour instead of flour. Came out more like corncake but was a big hit with the kids.

This recipe is a keeper! I took another reviewer's suggestion to add honey - 1 Tbsp. was all - and, for my husband's preferences, added 2 Tbsps. of crushed jalapenos. Perfect, perfect, perfect!

I have been making this cornbread for about 2 years now and everyone loves it! The only thing I change is I had an extra tablespoon of sugar because I like it a little more on the sweeter side. Thanks for sharing!

Made with adjustments to be non-dairy - used nondairy butter and soy milk.  Turned out beautifully!  Needed to cook about 38 minutes to get cooked through in my 8-inch Pyrex pan.  Both my husband and I LOVE this recipe - we both went back for seconds!!!  Very cake-like and fluffy.

I will definitely make this again. I needed to  substitute all purpose gluten-free flour and added a half teaspoon extra of baking powder.  It rose beautifilly in my unpredictable oven and for that alone is a winner. That it tasted wonderful with a lovely texture was a bonus.

This was pretty good, basic cornbread!  The whole family enjoyed it with a big bowl of red beans and rice :)  I think you could easily add a can of creamed corn, shredded cheese, or some chopped fresh jalapenos to take this up a notch.  YUM!!

I have made this recipe twice now and it was perfect both times; Very versatile. I poured the first batch over a homemade mac'n cheese for a casserole in an 8x9 and baked at 375 for 45min. The only thing I do different is use a 1/4 cup butter with a 1/4 cup bacon lard... because I'm a big fan of eating healthy and forgetting flavor ;)

This recipe is perfect.  Hubby and I were arguing over who got the last piece!!  :)
 I made a couple of changes due to a severe dairy intolerance in my home, but it didn't change the integrity of the recipe one bit!!  I did end up cooking the bread for closer to 50 minutes before my knife came out clean, but I am not sure if that was due to my changes or if the pan I used was different from the original post.  
This recipe will be made again and again!!

Outstanding served with "Slow Cooker Southern Lima Beans and Ham".  I made it as written but it took 40 minutes to bake.

This is our favorite corn bread recipe.  Very sweet, dense, and moist.

Excellent as-is, especially if you're looking for a recipe similar to the *original* Marie Callender's (sweet) corn bread.

I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I substituted regular milk for coconut milk and regular flour for coconut flour. When you use the coconut flour, you only have to use 3/4 cup. It turned out great! Good alternative for someone with a wheat  or dairy allergy.

I made the recipe as written. I put  mine in muffin tins it made 12 muffins. They took about 18 minutes to bake.I served them with chili. Turned out perfectly, sweet and moist. I seem to make a different corn bread recipe each time I make them, never being completely satisfied. I usually don't like to add extra sugar to things but in this case it made a big difference. My husband like them also.

I made this twice, the first time as written and found it just ok  although the consistency is exactly as I like it. The 2nd time, I added about 2 tablespoons of honey, received rave reviews. Perfect to go with a chili cook off. Thanks for posting the recipe.

This did not disappoint. Just the right amount of sweetness that it didn't taste like dessert - although with a bit of jam on top, it would make a nice dessert! Also liked the texture - not too moist & not too dry! I will use this again! Thanks :)

Really good.  I used this recipe, because  I  didn't  have sour cream which my normal go-to recipe  calls for.  This  recipe  turned out good.  I made it exactly  as written. Baked in 9 inch pan.Crispy  edges.  Moist inside.   It will not be replacing  my go-to recipe, but it has earned  itself  a space  in my recipe  keeper.

This is the best corn bread. I do equal portions of corn meal and flour. My family loves it eery time I make it. And I always have the ingredients on hand - no need to go to the store for buttermilk.

I made this today to try it before making it for the family this weekend for Thanksgiving. SO SO yummy!!! The only change I made to it was adding a tsp of vanilla otherwise I made it as is. I'll definitely be making it again though maybe next time I'll make muffins instead

I just made this cornbread today and had a piece.  It is soooooooooo dense.  I was so disappointed and now my stomach feels like it has a big rock sitting in there.  This is the worst cornbread that I've ever made.  What a waste of good ingredients.  You should take it out of your collection before someone gets really sick!

after baking these today, I agree with some of the reviews I just read, the corn meal to flour ratio is off. They do taste more like bisquits than corn bread and they aren't sweet.
