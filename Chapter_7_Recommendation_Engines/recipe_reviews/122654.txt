We really enjoyed the muffins. They were really good. Tasted like summer. Not heavy or overly sweet. I made then twice, once the way written and the second time with adjustments. The first ones were good, okay, light, flavorful but jsut tasted like they needed a boost. The second time I added the zest of one lemon, used Splenda instead of sugar and whole wheat flour. I had to add a teaspoon of baking powder for each cup of whole wheat flour I substituted an add more liquid which I did in the form of 2/3 cup of lemonade. I also added chopped pecans to the topping. I also made them in my huge muffin pan. It held almost two batches. Everyone has asked for them again. I am giving this one 5 stars. I would feel quite ocmfortable serving them to guests. Good job.

These muffins were delicious - very light and fluffy, as expected. The only change I made was to add the zest of one lemon to the batter. I did end up with 21 muffins when I filled the cups 2/3 full as directed. The next time I may try adding a touch of butter to the topping. I used pecans in my streusel and it was delicious, but didn't stay together (that's where the butter may help). Thanks for a delicious recipe!

These are only "okay" in my home. The recipe really needs zest, so do add zest! Some reviewers said the texture was "fluffy", "light".... I got a moist but rather densely cakey muffin! Definitely not like many muffins I've had, nor like a cake but closer to a cake. I am an experienced life-long baker. I followed the recipe exactly (except for making them with 1/2 whole wheat), even NOT adding in the zest I sensed it did need for a truly well-balanced lemony flavor. The flavor was somewhat lemony, but in a screeching, unbalanced way. I made many variations: exactly as written; some w/ fresh raspberries (nicest flavor); some w/ dried blueberries (the dried didn't add anything, so probably better w/ fresh berries); some w/ poppy seeds (poppy was ok, but would've been better in a better-textured muffin). TOPPING: I pulverized the ingreds. to a powder in the Magic Bullet. It had no problem staying on muffin (but this isn't "streusel" as I think of streusel as being crumbly flavorful bits). I tried tiny batches of each of the following: macadamia, almond, pecan, & cashew. There wasn't a noticeable taste difference between the nuts, because the nuts' flavors were diminished by having been mixed with flour. So, use whatever nuts you want! QUANTITY: A full recipe made 12 regular-sized (baked in 20 mins.) AND 16 mini-muffins (baked in 12 mins.).

I made a half a batch of this, just for my boys. I made sure to beat the fat with the sugar really well, then add in the eggs one by one. I then carefully stirred in the dry ingredients. They baked up beautifully and smelled wonderful. They seemed to like them well enough, I just think I served them up to the wrong crowd. This might be good for when I have other mothers over for coffee. I might add a little more lemon juice next time for them. I would probably double the topping, too.

I made it exactly as stated but only for 6 servings. I did use fresh squeezed lemon juice and the muffins were lemony enough. Maybe next time I'll use 2 T of fresh squeezed lemon juice to decrease some of the tartness.

They were soooo goood with the evening coffee.My kids friends have been watching what I have been gooking lately and they  gave them 5 stars as well! I also toasted my walnuts for extra flavor. I put the streusel on top put not Alot, next time, I'll add more,cover the muffin completely with it. I didn't have reg.br.sugar so I used splenda br.sugar. Thank you, Thank You for a wonderful  and delightful muffin Mary Kelly!! Patty :)

Good lemon-y muffins! The texture really is light and fluffy, yet moist enough without being greasy. I cut some cold butter into the streusel, but it didn't really bake into the crumbly topping I was expecting. That is quite possibly my fault for adding butter! I really feel that I want to add fresh blackberries or raspberries to this recipe. Not because it's lacking moisture, but they just were a little plain for my personal taste. I ended up with 18 muffins, and not quite enough streusel for all. I used pecans, but I'd like to try it with almonds. The bake time was 16 minutes on the top rack (in my weirdo oven). I will make these again (with a tried and true  topping) and add blackberries. Thanks.

These really aren't rocking my socks off or floating my boat.  I made them exactly to recipe (even full fat!) and while they came out fluffy I really just wasn't terribly impressed with the flavor.  It doesn't help that all my streusel topping falls off as I try to eat them- I even tried to smush it in a little with the back of a spoon before I baked.  Not worth the effort, I will try another recipe next time.

I made this into a loaf of sweet bread. Which I now don't recommend. The "bread" was light, fluffy, and crumbly. Which needed the smaller molding of a muffin pan. I added extra lemon juice but it was a little to tart--and in a more bottled lemon juice sort of way. I added lemon juice to the crumb topping hoping that would hold it together, it did sort of. More a clumpy mess than a crumb topping. I do agree though the basic recipe was a little boring, I kept thinking it needed a frosting glaze on the top instead of a crumb topping and a fruit in it.

These muffins were very good! The only thing I altered was I used splenda in place of both sugars. They came out very moist and fluffy. I agree with other reviewers the next time I make them I will add a touch of butter to the steusel topping. I definitely recommend these they are a wonderful lemon-y muffin!

These got rave reviews from the family. I added the zest of one lemon because I was afraid that they wouldn't be lemony enough. They came out very tangy and lemony. They are quite dense. I wasn't sure how stiff the egg whites were supposed to be, so I ended up making them *almost* meringue consistency, which was kind of difficult to fold into the batter but turned out fine. This recipe made 18 muffins for me, even though I filled the muffin cups about 3/4 full. I used pecans for the streusel, and didn't have nutmeg so I subbed cinnamon. I have to agree that these are delicious the first day but after that they lose appeal. After a few days of eating these each morning, I got sick of the dense texture. Apparently my family stopped eating them too, because there are several left after a week.

This did not have enough lemon flavor for my taste. However, some of my co-workers loved it. Next time, I would omit the nuts from the streusel toping- the flavors didn't seem to go together.

These were delicious - wonderful lemon flavor!  The texture was more like a crumb cake or coffee cake than the muffins I'm used to, but it worked.  I used almonds in the streusel topping, but may try pecans or hazelnuts the next time.

These were OK.  I didn't think that they had much of a lemon flavor, so I made a lemon glaze to go on top.

These were great. I would have taken the advice of some of the other bakers and added lemon zest, but I made them during a blizzard and couldn't go to the store for a lemon. I also omitted the streusel topping because I didn't have any nuts (thanks to the aforementioned blizzard). Instead I made a lemon juice/ powdered sugar glaze. They were a great pickup during some nasty weather.

These are by far the best muffins I have ever made.  They were perfect as I was looking for a lemon muffin recipe that didn't call for lemon yogurt.  These still turned out moist and delicious.  I did have to cook them longer than called for - I think it ended up being right over 30 minutes.  Well worth it!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I got 18 muffins from the batter.  The bake time was right on. They are light and airy (we like our muffins dense).  I found that it was not lemon-y enough (I used lemon juice from concentrate..from the bottle) so I added about  1 Tsp of pure lemon extract. Overall, the muffins are good.  THX

These recieved mixed reviews in my home. Some gave it 5 stars, others 2 or 3. I used chopped pecans as the nut. I think it would be alot better if some of the nuts were mixed through the muffin. Personally I didnt care for the nutmeg, I think I'll leave that flavor for my pumpkin pie and maybe use poppy seeds instead.

Wow, these are really, really good!  I cut the servings down to 3 & got 6 petite(not bite sized, just not large) muffins out of it. I did double the amount of lemon juice the recipe called for & the flavor pops right out.  Like a dunce, I forgot to add in the egg white (duh!!!) & didn't notice until too late but my muffins still came out very fluffy & moist. Next time I might add a little bit of nutmeg to the actual batter because I wanted a touch more of that flavor to compliment the lemon, but that is just a personal preferance. For the topping I used chopped walnuts because that is what we had around the house & I liked them alot.  Like others, my struesel didn't really stay together well, but it was still yummy.  I have a feeling the muffins are not going to last the day...  ;)  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

These were really tasty muffins. My kids loved them. I did completely forget the streusel topping but thats because I was half asleep when I was making them. I also added a tablespoon of lemon zest to the recipe because I wanted to make sure the lemon flavor was there.

This was a light and moist muffin - I'm sure it tastes wonderful! My result was terrible because I overdosed it with lemon juice (I accidentally doubled it), but even then I could tell it was a good recipe. I didn't have nutmeg on hand so I omitted the streusal topping.

These muffins are fantastic! Great with morning coffee. DH says they are the best he's ever tasted.  I used a large muffin pan and ended up with 6 big beautiful, light and fluffy muffins. I used pecans and also added a pat of butter to the streusel to help it stay together. DH took 3 muffins to work to share with co-workers and they all gave them 5 stars. Next time I'll try doubleing the lemon juice for extra flavor.

These muffins are so light and refreshing.  I actually forgot to do the strusel on top because I was in a hurry, but they still came out beautifully.
