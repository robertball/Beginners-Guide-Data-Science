Very good- I did make a few changes. Used the refrigerated pizza dough, which was really good and then carmelized the onions a little before putting on the pizza. Loved the blue cheese flavor and so did my husband! Oh, and I also spread a little pesto that I had sitting in my fridge. Thanks for the recipe!

Good and easy to make for lunch or quick snack. Used the pilsbury pizza dough. next time I will layer pizza with spaghetti sauce, too cheesy for me without it. Only use one cup of the mozzerella cheese, any more and it gets over cheesy. Blue cheese crumbles were great addition. I also cut up cherry tomatoes and covered the pizza in them. Quick, easy, good recipe.

I used half of a batch of Quick and Easy Pizza Dough in place of the bread dough in this recipe and only made one pizza. Other than that, I changed nothing. Interesting flavor combination. I'm not really sure I like the blue cheese, but I have the other half waiting for dinner. I'll give it another shot. It was simple to put together and I liked the way it smelled when baking.

Yummy was a hit at party.  I didn't have frozen loaf bread but had  used pita bread instead still turned out great.
