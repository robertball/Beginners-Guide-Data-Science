I have used this for years. I have played around with it a little and found that a teaspoon of sugar cuts the acidity of the tomatoes. And if you want to make it taste a little richer, stir in a quarter cup of cream before serving. Also, I drain grease off the beef before adding any vegetables, that way you aren't pouring out all your garlic/onion flavour!

Easy, painless, and tastes good. I will def use as a base recipe again. Maybe it's in the asian in me that likes to marinate everything... but if you marinate the beef in 2 tb of soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce and a 1/4 of salt for 15 minutes before sauteing...it adds a world of difference to the flavor in the beef.  It no longer just just tastes like tomato sauce drenched in flavorless meat.  Also add salt and pepper to the meat (to taste) while sauteing with the onions and garlic and peppers before adding to the sauce.

I love this recipe and it has become my favorite with a couple of small changes.  I like my sauce more creamy with the tomatoes less chunky, so I use "crushed" instead of diced tomatoes.  I love mushrooms, so I also add a 7 ounce jar (drained) of button mushrooms (usually Pennsylvania Dutchman available at my regular grocery).  The button type mushrooms are good because they are easy to see in the sauce and can be left off the spoon for those eaters who don't like them.

This recipe was very easy and tasty.  It's a really hearty sauce and next time I'll add sauteed mushrooms.  I'll certainly make it again!!

Great recipe! I looked through the reviews as I always do because I get a kick out of some of them. I saw one that said "I used this instead of this and didn't use as much of this and it seemed to be missing something". I'm all for improving a recipe if it needs it but don't change the recipe and then leave a review that reflects something completely different than you're reviewing.

We used this recipe for a benefit where we fed over 400 people, everyone enjoyed it. We increased the ingredients by 500, did the math, added a little more beef than what it called for, but it turned out great and was fairly easy to do. If I am crazy enough to do another benefit, we will use this recipe.

Five stars for a quick, easy, delicious recipe!  I DID use 1 1/2 lbs beef and a large can (29oz) of diced tomatoes (I wanted a little extra sauce), but those were the only changes.  Thanks to Hank's mom!

Great basic recipe. I also add a bay leaf, and 1/8 to 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese. An old italian woman taught my mom to add the grated parmesan, it really adds flavor, depth, richness and thickens it.

I absolutely loved this spaghetti sauce and so did my father and brother. I used "Italian Seasoning", but other than that, I didn't have to substitute anything.

Yes, this recipe is typical straight forward tomato sauce.But if you want it to JUMP OFF THE PLATE, consider these ingredients.   1) Anchovies! Saute with garlic and onion, drain, set aside. Then saute the beef, drain, return garlic/achhovies/onion to pot, add remaiming ingredients. 2) Splash of red wine vinegar (or more!), soy sauce, lots of fresh ground pepper, chili flakes(YES!). 3) And when you think the sauce is right, now comes the magic ingredient. Julia Child (God trest her soul) added BUTTER(4 tbls. plus) to it! Let's face it, butter is the answer to anything. If it's good enough for Julia, it's good enough for me!  4) Last but not least: a good Italian Barbaresco/Borolo/Amarone!

The wine!!  The italians add wine to their sauce. When the ground beef is cooked, I put half a bottle of red wine an let it reduce by half.  Then I add the tomatoes and let it cook.  You don't taste the alcool, it just gives more depth to the sauce.  I also substitute the bell peppers for mushrooms.

I fixed this for supper tonight and it went over wonderful.  Wife even went back for a second helping even though she doesn’t like tomatoes.  The best spaghetti sauce I have ever eaten.  I began by browning the ground beef, onion, garlic, and green pepper in a sauce pan.  While the meat and vegetables where browning, I combined the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste in the crock pot. Once the meat and vegetables where brown, I added the oregano, basil, salt, and pepper and let that simmer for a short time. I then combined all the ingredients in the crock pot and let it simmer for four hours.

this is basically the recipe i have used for years. secret is the tomato paste. to make life easier--i add to slow cooker and cook on low for several hours. great to cook all day while at work. that makes the sauce richer and not have the sweet taste you get when cooking for shorter periods of time. you will love it cooked in slow cooker.  italian seasoning works also. i leave off the bell pepper. i increase amounts because i cook for large group.

This is really an old recipe as I have making it like this for 50+ years and I also use mushrooms in it. Iuse it as the sauce for my lasagna, my baked spagetti and baked ziti. It freezes well, so makae up a large batch and freeze part of it for a future meal.

This is a really good basic sauce.  Not a special sauce.  A good basic sauce.  It came out a little too thick and chunky for me so next time I would probably omit the can of tomato paste or add some of the pasta water to thin it out.  Like a lot of other reviewers I added about a tsp. of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes and that definitely improved the sauce.  I think next time I would jazz it up with some red wine, black olives, mushrooms, fresh basil or etc.  Oh, and for the people who don't like green peppers....why make this recipe in the first place?  The green peppers are what make this sauce as good as it is.

Yummy.  I couldn't help myself and had to have seconds.  The only thing I did a tiny bit different was add about 2 teaspoons of sugar.   Very easy, very quick-- and well liked by my family.

My whole family loved this sauce!  My husband said this was one of my better meals, and my 2-year-old couldn't get enough of it!  I did make a couple of minor changes due to personal preferences.  One, I didn't use green peppers, though I'm sure they work nicely in such a sauce.  Also, I used ground seitan instead of beef since my family is vegetarian.  The seitan worked very nicely in the sauce and I was pretty much able to follow the directions with little changes (had to add oil because I wasn't using beef).

This was excellent. I have always made sauce from the packet not knowing any other way.  I didn't have tomato paste but did everything else as listed in the recipe.  I had some frozen green and red peppers and loved the flavor they added.  Super yummy sauce that makes a lot.There is only two of us so i was able to freeze a whole quart of sauce for later.

This is a great basic start to spaghetti sauce and the one passed down through my family. The trick to a great sauce it to always let it simmer for at least an hour or more. Fresh herbs are a plus to sauce, but don't add them until the last twenty minutes, when I start my noodles is when I add them. Go ahead and add the dry spices at the beginning of cooking and add the fresh at the end. I always add about a 1/4 cup of red wine to my sauce, gives that little bit of sweetness. Top with some fresh cilantro and freshly grated Romano cheese.

I didn't have the green pepper and I did make a few changes according to the other comments. I added 1/4 cup of red wine, 1 bay leaf, about 3 tsp. of sugar, 1 tsp. red pepper flakes, 1 tsp. garlic powder, and probably doubled the oregano and basil. Will make again.

I used a red bell pepper instead of green and I only used a pinch of salt. The canned ingredients I used were all organic. This seemed to be missing something that I couldn't put my finger on but I appreciated that it was simple and hearty and also budget-friendly, which I really appreciated.

As others have said, this is an excellent basic recipe that can be customized to ones own taste.  As a mother of 3 teenagers, I like to make this kind of sauce in bulk and freeze it for those days when I don't have the time or inclination to cook from scratch.  I buy a pack of lean ground beef from Costco which is about 6lbs, brown that on its own, drain the fat.  Then I saute the onions, bell peppers (anything but green - I find them bitter) and garlic, add that.  Someone suggested adding red wine to the ground beef (after it's browned), tried a Cabernet today, that added a nice depth.  I add the diced tomatoes but about half the recommended tomato sauce and paste, and no salt as all that canned tomato has lots of added salt. Today I used some crushed tomato as well.  Totally depends on how chunky or smooth your family likes it.  Also a good recipe to slip in some pureed veggies... More of an art than a science! When multiplying, definitely simmer for much longer - 2 to 3 hours.  Dinner for five tonight, plus about 8 canning jars of sauce to freeze... just add noodles!

Great basic recipe. Mushrooms, bay leaf, and Italian sausage instead of ground beef would be good additions.

Excellent sauce!  This recipe is very close to the basic bolognese my mother made, and that I always go back to, especially when I need something reliable. I also leave out the peppers, and I add fresh sliced mushrooms which I saute with the other veggies (I always brown the meat and drain it before adding the veggies as well).  One of my mother's special touches that I I never leave out: about 1 tsp of fennel seed, which I crush with a mortar and pestle.  It gives some sweetness plus a hint of Italian sausage flavor to the sauce (fennel seed is a primary seasoning in Italian sausage).  Other than that, this is one of those no-fail, always-a-hit recipes that become family traditions.

How strange to see the recipe I was handed by my mother in this collection.  I've used this as a base for pasta sauces my entire adult life and its never let me down.  It's very easy to tweak for different tastes and serves as a perfect base for more complex meals.  Thank you for sharing.

All I have to say this sauce is perfect is simple but very delitious and you can always add mashrooms if you want or black olives it gives you that choice without ruining the original. Thank you for this delicious sauce.

I've made this recipe quite a number of times and every single time the compliments I got were "This is the best pasta I've ever had" or once "We better get some good quality wine for this pasta, cause it deserves it". 
I actually use this recipe whenever I wanna impress someone cause its so delicious! I really do follow it step by step, the only thing I change is sometimes I add some extra herbs or some water while the sauce is sizzling so it doesn't stay too dense. :)

Well....used boneless chicken breasts instead of chopped meat, that was ok, but the herb ratios seemed a bit too much...it was good mind you but I'll need to tweak it a bit......it was my first homemade sauce, so it worked.

Really like this recipe. Did add 1/4 red wine, 1 bay leaf and 2 teaspoons of sugar to counter the acidity. This is a very good base and will work well with everyone personal tastes.  Do try this recipe and do be creative.

This recipe was fantastic!  I altered it by using crushed & peeled Rienzi tomatoes, Rienzi tomato paste, 1 tsp.sugar, and 3 tsps. italian seasoning instead of basil and oregano and it came out great.
Very tasty recipe.  This is a keeper.

Always thinking of ways to include vege so.... and reduce red meat quanity. Also freeze multiple meals.   I addeded a good quantity very small pieces of chopped broccoli & zuccini with the tomatoes etc.  I also added a can of mushroom bits and pieces. (although I would normally add fresh mushrooms if on hand) This enabled me to reduce the beef quantity, but retain the flavour  I always make double plus quantities of recipe's that are ok for freezing so froze portions for future use.   Whenever I cook pasta or rice i cook large amounts so i can freeze cooked portions in 100gr freezer bags.  To use either micorwave or soak in hot water...

This is the same meat sauce recipe I've been using for years minus the peppers. I often add sliced, sauteed mushrooms and use crushed tomatoes instead of diced since we prefer a less chunky sauce.

This recipe is pretty good, but I also add either some sherry or red wine (2/3 of a cup) and some sautéed mushrooms, to me this makes all the difference.  Please don't ever buy that stuff in a jar they call pasta sauce, this recipe is ten times better than anything you can buy off the shelf.

This is a fabulous recipe, I've made it several times and now I double or triple it and freeze the rest. I don't care for the green peppers so I leave those out of any sauce. The only other changes are that I use crushed tomatoes instead of diced and since those are a little thicker so you need to add a bit of water.  I also add a tiny bit of sugar to cut the acid.  To make this on a low salt diet use "no salt added" tomatoes and leave out the salt.  It's better than any sauce you could buy!

This is a tasty hearty sauce with no effort. I only had mexican tomato sauce and the tomato paste had roasted garlic. I used a yellow pepper and added a bit of sugar to cut the acid from the tomato. I simmered this covered for a couple of hours before serving. The sauce was tasty and tomatoey. I prefer more body in my sauce and no chunks, but the flavor was good. While this did not make my favorites, it is a good decent homemade sauce and we enjoyed our meal. Thanks!

This was excellent spaghetti sauce tonight for dinner and made enough to last us at least one more night if not two. I did add a teaspoon of sugar but otherwise made it exactly as directed. It's going in my recipe box as my stand-by pasta sauce. Thanks for posting!

I love the recipe but I did add some water.  Without water, it seemed that it was way too thick.  I added enough to get to the consitency I like.   Like the recipe.

This is an awesome recipe. I follow the recipe exactly. I always make big batch of this sauce and freeze it for those hectic weekdays. I use this mostly on spaghetti and serve it with gralic bread. I also used it in lasagna several times and it turned out great. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is almost the same as ours except for a small can of water and my Aunt always grated the green pepper and onion so that as kids we would not see it and refuse to eat.  Now, that I cook, I find grating it actually makes it taste even better.  We also add 1 teaspoon of sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes

Nothing special, I'll stick to the one from my husband's Italian grandmother. But, I couldn't believe that someone put ketchup in their sauce? In spaghetti sauce? Oh yuck.
And I also can't believe how many people have completely changed the recipe and then rate it. When are people going to stop doing this? Never I guess. It's so irritating!

This is a good sauce. I did a couple things different, mainly because I didn't have the right size cans of sauce/diced tomatoes. I had canned fresh tomatoes (16 ounces) from the summer (first time tasting them-SO GOOD!) and then about 12 ounces of tomato sauce. It came out way too thick (the tomato paste) with these lesser amounts so I added a cup of water. I also did the marinated meat one reviewer talked about-2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 2 tsp worcestershire, 1/4 tsp salt for 15 minutes. Lastly, I added about 4 tablespoons of fresh basil. Overall I think it turned out great, but I'll probably try the red wine method next time!

i followed recipe to a "T". Delicious!! The first time i made it i used "hunts fire roasted diced tomatoes" which gave it a kick and generic store brand for the other tomato products... The second time i made it my husband was unable to find the fire roasted, so we used "HUNTS diced with basil, garlic and oregeno" so it wasnt spicy and hunts products for the sauce and paste. YUMMMY!!! i like the fact that no sugar is needed.

My family liked this sauce for spaghetti.  It's so much quicker to make than our other favorite (which takes half a day to make).  I usually omit the green pepper so that all of my kids will eat it.  Also, cooking the ground beef with the onion in it makes the onion texture almost undetectable in the final sauce -great for kids who think they don't like onions.  If we have mushrooms on hand, I'll mince those and throw them in as well... Just a good, simple recipe that does well with tweaking based on the ingredients we have on hand.  I do add some brown sugar (to almost anything cooked with tomatoes)- the amount depends on your tomatoes.  Most store-bought tomatoes are much less acidic than they used to be, so they don't need as much sugar.  Our home-grown varieties tend to be much more acidic, and require a bit more sugar.  Add the brown sugar a little at a time to keep from making a sweet sauce. I hate it when I do that!

For an even better sauce add a few roasted pork neck bone to the sauce.  I buy a large pkg of neck bones, roast them at 350 for 1 hour.  put them in the freezer to have on hand.  Before adding them to sauce wrap them in a piece of cheesecloth & just pull out when sauce is done.  I was raised with Italians & learned this from them.

I will never buy spaghetti sauce from the grocery store again! This sauce is great! I left out the bell peppers although I think it would be very tasty with them. The kids didn't want them though. I also took the advice of another reviewer and added a little sugar. This one is a definite keeper! Thanks!

This was wonderful...I only tweaked it a tiny bit based upon the reviews of others. I added a few sliced button mushrooms, filled the tomato paste can with some cabernet (red wine) and added it, used Italian seasoning and also added a bay leaf. Simmered it slowly for well over an hour an mamma mia...this was good!

We really enjoyed this spaghetti sauce a lot! The flavors really melded together well after simmering for an hour or so, and when I ate some leftovers today for lunch it tasted even better than last night. Not counting the simmering time, this was easy and quick to make so it would be good for either weeknight or a weekend meal. The sauce was a little thick so next time I might add an extra half a can of tomato sauce, but it was still great. Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked this tonight for dinner. I tasted it before I served it and it was great. My family and I loved it. I did add 1/4 cup of sugar to cut down the  acidity. I also used the tomato paste that has basil, oregano, and garlic already in it. It turned out awesome. I will definitely be making this again and again. I have added this to my recipe collection. Thanks, Hank's Mom.

This sauce was awesome!!! I made one other sauce on this site & didn't care for it. But this one was great & easy too!! I browned my meat & veggies in a skillet & then transferred everything into my slow cooker & let it simmer on low all day! My only change was I added 1/4 cup parm cheese & a bay leaf to it & boy was it delicious! I made enough for dinner & to freeze :-)

Easy and delicious.  Personally, I use only 1/2 tsp. oregano, crushed tomatoes instead of diced, leave out the green pepper and add about 1 tsp. sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  Excellent basic recipe.

This is almost the same recipe I have been making for 40 plus yrs.. The difference is I don't put diced tomatoes or tomato paste. I only use tomato sauce and I add canned mushrooms (buttons). Also use 2 llbs ground chuck. As far as the spices go I only use oregano, but that is because we don't care for basil. This is a basic recipe that is easy to make your own.

WAS AWESOME....BUT use FRESH BASIL AND FRESH MUSHROOMS (IF ADDING MUSHROOMS).   I left out the green peppers too due to picky kids.  I DID as others and added 1 tsp sugar.  Added one more garlic clove, 1.5lb ground sirlion and one more 8oz tomatoe sauce....  I made a day in advance and sat in fridge till ready to reheat - was excellent!

We really enjoyed this recipe with pasta or as a filling for stuffed peppers.  When I made this a added a little thyme (don't add a lot), marjoram, basil and oregano.  I have also made without onion, garlic or peppers and it's still delicious.  This recipe works well with stuffed peppers too - I microwave the peppers till fork tender, boil and add 1 package of Success brown rice to the meat mix and fill peppers, with leftover sauce surrounding the peppers and bake in 350 oven about 12 to 15 minutes, just till cheddar cheese on top melts, as everything is very hot when I assemble the stuffed peppers.  Too make it healthier I use salt free tomato products.

This is the exact recipe I've made for years except I always add a 1/4 teaspoon or so of cayenne pepper and a teaspoon of sugar. Sometimes I throw in a few dried pepper flakes if I want a little more zing.    I also bag any leftovers and freeze it for quick meals.

Excellent recipe and easy to add other veggies such as mushrooms and or celery.  I switched the green pepper for red as they are sweeter.  Also, added the herbs only during the last 15 minutes of cooking as basil loses its flavour fast if cooked longer.

I was looking for a basic sauce recipe to use with my tomatoes from the garden.  I followed this recipe exactly, except used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  It turned out beautifully and very tasty.

Been making this for years using fresh herbs grown outdoors and never on spaghetti but with either elbow macaroni, rigatoni or rigate pasta's, throw in some sliced or quartered mushrooms and a splash of chianti or cabernet sauvignon.  Feel free to eliminate the paste and use tomato puree.

I made this with mild ground Italian sausage it tasted so good! I recommend trying it with the Italian sausage instead of ground beef which can be boring. This sauce has a beautiful deep and bright red color and the onion and bell pepper add awesome flavor. It tastes SO much better than jarred spaghetti sauce and its nice and thick not all runny and watered down like the store bought jarred sauce can be. Thank you for the recipe!

I modified this a lot (due to personal taste and ingredients I had on hand), but it turned out great--fantastic flavor. I actually used 2 onions, 6 cloves garlic, no peppers, and no meat--I had to use a bit of olive oil to saute the onion and garlic. I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used two 14.5 ounce cans of diced tomatoes and blended one of them to a sauce; then I used a full 14.5 ounce can of tomato paste. I bumped up the basil and oregano to 3 teaspoons each and omitted the salt. 

I was hesitant to even post this review due to the number of changes, but it turned out so good I felt compelled to post. 

Even with my changes and the complexity of blending tomatoes, this was incredibly easy and one I will definitely make again.

Good basic recipe.  Like a few cooks suggested, I added some red wine and mushrooms.  Will definitely make this again.  It made quite a bit and with just two of us, there is plenty to freeze for later use.

Absolutely delicious sauce! I didn't change any of the ingredients. The only change I made to this was the cook time. I put all ingredients in the crock pot and slow cooked for 8 hours. I noticed within an hour it had great flavor already. I also ran my sauce through the chopper to chop chunky tomatoes, peppers and onions as my kids aren't a fan of "chunks". This was a great sauce and I will probably never buy it from a can or jar again!

Awesome recipe!  Very easy and fairly quick! The aroma of spices filled my apartment and even stunk up the hallway of our apartment building... Very good! The only thing I did differently; I used half ground turkey, half ground beef, added an 8oz can of mushroom heads/stems (thanks to suggestions from other reviewers), and when the sauce was finished cooking, i sprinkled a small amount of chopped basil and parmesan. Simply fabulous!

im not a canned tomato person, so i am using a lot of fresh tomatoes, crushed, instead of the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes, and it still tastes really good. Still on the stove, but the simple flavours are truly amazing. Thanks!

I have been making  this sauce for 37 years, minus the diced tomatoes. I got the recipe from Berty Crockers Dinner for Two Cookbook. It used garlic powder but over time I  started using fresh garlic.

I never rate recipes, but this one I couldn't resist. I have made this sauce several times over pasta and in lasagnas. Each time it came out perfect. I tweaked it by adding a teaspoon of sugar as a pp suggested. As well, I halved the spices and it still came out delicious!

I made this last night and it was too tangy and acidic for my husband and I.  I even added 1 teaspoon of sugar to help tone down the acidic taste and it didn't quite do the trick.

I liked this a lot. I felt like it was missing a "kick" for flavor, but overall this is a great recipe and each time I make it I'll add something new. I think the flavor issue is due to my novice status as a cook and not the recipe. I left out the peppers and added 1/2 cup of Basalmic vinegar. Also substituted the salt for no-sodium salt. Still delicious!

I used this recipe as a guideline more than a strict formula, using more tomato sauce and a whopping 2.5 lbs of beef. I definitely recommend adding extra meat - my carnivorous friends loved it.

I substituted a tsp and a half of garlic salt for the minced garlic. I also omitted the seasonings, and used a little over 1/3 cup of tones, spicy spaghetti seasoning. Added an extra green pepper, 1 cup of water, and an extra 14 oz can of tomatoe sauce, and a tsp of sugar, then let it simmer in a crockpot for several hours.  Amazing recipe, just added changes based on my tastes, items on hand, and stretching it to make a slightly bigger batch

It was okay, I followed it to a Tee, tasted it, added more oregano and basil, tasted it, and still was good but not full of flavor.  I'll make it again and mess around with the spices and ingreidents a little. Makes a good base sauce!

This is similar to my family recipe. But we do not use tomato paste only tomato sauce(about 3-4 16 oz). I chop a little bit of bacon and cook it with the ground beef also some celery with the other veggies and also add some chili powder. Everyone always has good things to say about it.

This was good and I would make this again and again. Only difference I would make is add some sugar to it to cut out the acidity.

I can't RAVE about this, but it's pretty good.  I think I would use this recipe whenever I want spaghetti, just to be able to control the salt and preservatives that usually come in jarred spaghetti sauce.  I did add a teaspoon of sugar and quite a bit more oregano and basil than called for.

Very good recipe. If you add a packet of chili seasoning it will give this sauce a little extra flavor. That's how I've been doing it and I LOVE it.

This was really good. I took another reviewers suggestion and added 1 tsp sugar.  I also browned the meat first, drained,  then added the veggies.  They cooked through while simmering.

I made this for dinner tonight, and my husband and I loved it! I followed the recipe but added 2 tsps sugar, 1/3 cup Barbera red wine, mushrooms, 2 links of hot Italian sausage and garlic salt. I also upped the garlic by a couple of cloves. It turned out absolutely delicious! I've never had good luck making my own sauce before and thought I would be stuck with canned pasta sauce, but this recipe is SO much better! Try this recipe tonight!

An excellent simple sauce.  We added more garlic and used a large white onion because we love both and it was perfect.

This was an excellent sauce...I made a couple of minor changes; added some mild italian sausage with my hamburger and since I'm not a fan  of green peppers (I actually hate them)I only used 1/2.  I also added the sugar.

This was easy and very good.  Way better than my favorite jarred sauce.  I think I may add a little sugar next time to reduce the acidity of the tomatoes.  Very well received at my house.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I enjoyed the taste, but not as a sauce I would make every time.  The meat overpowered the true taste of the sauce.   If you want a quick and easy way to make a sauce it works well.

This was very good, in fact I am writing this review as this is my second time making this dish and I didn't get around to it the first time I was too full to review the first time LOL. I must admit the first time I tried this I did not have peppers on hand and it was still good. I am making it with all ingredients tonight and I already know it's gonna be the 5 stars I rated it with the pepper added. We like this on rigatoni with parm on top . Thanks for a weeknight keeper!

This is pretty well the recipe I make all the time and LOVE. When my kitchen's stocked though, I add more spices, and many more veggies, especially spinach. But as is, it's delicious.

Excellent.  I used sausage instead of ground beef.  Next time I think I'll try crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes because the kids didn't like the chunks.

This was a really good recipe and we enjoyed it alot! I did add some sugar to cut the bitterness of the tomatoes, and I also added a little Italian seasoning also. It was very good and easy to make.It had ingredients I always have around, plus it didn't have to cook all day. Thanks for sharing!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I make this once a week and my husband and kids never get tired of it.  The only thing different I do is add some sugar, about 3 Tablespoons, to take the bitterness out.  Also, we don't like green pepper, so I omit them.   Anyway, thanks for a great recipe, I'll never make spaghetti any other way again!

I added 2 extra cloves of garlic and changed the peppers to a pepper blend of black pepper and dehydrated sweet peppers. My husband tasted this and said I finally made some great pasta sauce. My poor attempts at sauce making are legendary with my family. LOL This recipe has ended my lousy record!

Very yummy! Made a lot so I would have leftovers - next time I will add more ground beef as I like a meatier sauce - I also snuck in some thyme, parsley, red pepper, and mushrooms - but just because my boyfriend wanted them, I liked the sauce as it was before any of that stuff :)

Very good... Missing something though.. Maybe I'll add red wine and fresh basil next time. But very delish! I did add a small jalapeno pepper, cayenne, and crushed red.. We love spice in this house!! Loved the green bell pepper and will use this recipe again!!

I have been making this sauce for years, I add about a Tbs. of chili powder and 1lb fresh mushrooms.  I always add at least a tsp of sugar with any tomato dish, as it brings out the tomato flavor.  nancybk

This turned out to be the best spaghetti sauce i've ever made.  I made a few alterations which turned out very well.  I added a tsp of cumin to the ground meat while I browned it along with a light sprinkling of cinnamon.  I also added fresh mushrooms and used 5 sprigs of fresh basil instead of dried.  Finally, I added a 1/2 tsp of brown sugar at the end for a little added flavor.

Nice flavored spaghetti sauce, however I did add a splash of red wine and a little extra herbs.  I will make this again.

Add 1 can of water to tomato mixture (before adding anything else) and bring to a boil, stirring the whole time to keep it from sticking to the bottom. 
Reduce heat to a simmer. 
Add 1/2 tsp baking soda. Stir in and skim off foam. This will greatly reduce the acidity without removing tanginess. 

Add other ingredients as instructed. 

Also add grated Parmesan to the sauce. 

Add about 2 tsp sugar

Let simmer for at least an hour, but longer is better. 

Best if made with Italian sausage (casing removed).

I liked it a lot. It reminded me of the meat sauce my mother used to make when I was growing up. I took some suggestions from other reviewers (which is why I didn't give the  original recipe 5 stars)
1) I browned the meat , drained it, then added the onions and peppers.
2) When I used ground beef I lightly marinated it in Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.
3) I added grated parmesean to the sauce to thicken it up and give it a little flavor.
4) I LOVE garlic, so added a little more than four cloves.

My family liked it! I have also made it with ground pork (I left out the marinating with that since pork has plenty of flavor on it's own.

Definitely putting this one into our rotation!

Quick and easy! Can't imagine buying jarred spaghetti sauce any more. It was fine just as the recipe was written (first batch made). All who ate it enjoyed it a lot.  The next time I made it I used fresh basil and parsley as well, and tried another person's suggestion of marinating the ground beef in soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sugar and salt before browning.  These additions really gave it an added depth of flavoring.  Either way, we enjoyed it. Thanks for  sharing the recipe!

Very close as how i make mine.Difference is i put vegetable oil  rosemary, fresh basil, mince carrot and celery. I also add a bit of white sugar and a couple of bay leaves. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and not tomatoe sauce. One hour for me is not enough simmer time, i simmered it for 2 and 1/2 hours  in my oven uncovered. It came out  nice and thick. I use oil in my sauce as i find it gives the pasta a nice color.

I only moved out like a year and a half ago, and so I'm always trying to learn to make new things. I'm also vegan, so sometimes i like to take "non-vegan" recipes and veganize them. This was one of them. I replaced the ground beef by Gardeins veggie grounds, OH MY GOD. This is the best spaghetti sauce ive ever had! Dare I say better than my mums?!

This is a classic spaghetti or lasagna sauce.  For added flavor, I'd recommend cutting the ground beef in half and substituting sweet italian sausage instead for a good mixture.  It also wouldn't hurt to get a good sear on the beef so you carry the caramelized flavor into the sauce.

2.5 stars from the boyfriend; I added a little of my homemade pasta sauce, fresh tomatoes.  Marinated the meat first in soy sauce, worchetshire sauce, sugar, as some suggested, and in garlic and fresh parsley before cooking.  Salted and peppered. Used 1 pound 90% ground beef, added coconut oil to the pan for browing.  Wasn't greasy so didn't drain.  Put in the green peppers, onion, abay leaf, veggies were tender.  Even added 1/2 cup red wine, simmered for an hour.  Poured over rigatoni.  Just not as refined as we'd liked. We love pasta though so not sure what went wrong, if anything.

Very tasty.  I mostly followed the recipe with a few little changes/additions that worked well for my family.  I cooked and drained my ground beef; sautéed my vegetables in about 2 tsp. of EVOO, then added the beef back to the pan and proceeded with the recipe.  I pureed the tomatoes because my family does't like chunks of tomatoes in their sauce and I added the tomato paste to the mixture to blend it in before adding to the pot so that I wouldn't have to stir and work to combine it.  I added a tsp. of sugar to cut down on the acidity, about 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper (we like a little zing) and just before serving, stirred in about 1/4 to 1/3 cup (I didn't measure) of parmesan cheese to the mixture.  It was a hit with everyone.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is great and easy recipe. The only thing I did differently was season my meat with season salt and pepper and used turkey instead of ground beef. I would definitely make again.

This is an excellent base recipe. I made the sauce essentially as directed exceot i used jarred sauce, substituted a red pepper for the green (and choppped it real fine - my kids have no idea there's peppers this way) and no added tomatoes (my kids hate them) My biggest problem has always been gauging how much basil / oregano / parsley to add. 2 teaspoons was perfect! However, I changed a lot of things...to make the best sauce I've ever tasted IN MY LIFE.

I always start with canned / jarred spaghetti sauce and add my stuff from there. To make thia, I used Bertollii organic olive oil, basil and garlic sauce that I bought as a 4 pack at Costco. I substituted a red pepper for the green pepper, added 2 teaspoons of dried parsley flakes, 1/4 teaspoon of red cayenne pepper, 1 1/2 Tbsp of white sugar, and 2 tso of garlic powder.

OMG. This was absolutely delicious. It was rich, sweet, and a tad of spice. Not too hot for kids. My toddler gobbled it down. The only other difference was I used spiral noodles instead of spaghetti noodles. My kids eat it better this way and it made for a very pretty dish. Overall, an amazing dish with the additions. I'm about to dish up a second serving.

I love spaghetti sauce & this is a tasty great easy recipe! The few changes I made: used ground buffalo (personal preference) instead of ground beef, added 3 sprigs of fresh thyme & 1/2 bag of "power greens" to simmering sauce. Simmered for 2 hrs in cast iron pot, then added 1/2 cup heavy cream & 2 Tblsp melted butter, along with 1/2 cup of pasta water just before serving. Served with linguini, pumpernickel toasts, & a nice Sangiovese. Yum!

I make this exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. When making this be sure to simmer a hour. Each time you stir the pot you can taste improved flavor until the perfect finish.

Made for dinner tonight. It was really good. I doubled the diced tomatoes. My husband said it was the best spaghetti sauce he ever had.

I really loved this as a base recipe. To cut acidity while avoiding sugar, I shredded carrots into the sauce. (A secret I use to sneak more veggies in food). I left out the peppers, not a big fan of the flavor. I also added more beef and some fennel seeds. Next time I will try half ground pork and half ground beef.

Husband wanted spaghetti for dinner. Ditched my original plans and found this recipe. Fortunately I had all the ingredients and it was simple to make. Added 1 tsp sugar which several others suggested. Delicious thick, meaty sauce. Best I've ever tasted.

Perfect! I did spoon out the fat from the meat BEFORE adding the peppers/garlic/onions and also added a pinch of sugar. For those of you who don't love peppers, I challenge you to try making it with the peppers just to taste the difference it makes to the flavour of the sauce. I think the peppers are vital! Delicious. Thank you for this.

Almost identical to my grandmothers except   used fresh tomatoes for the diced and she would add 1 teaspoon of cocoa to it.  Yeah I know it sounds odd but  I have eaten it that way all my life and it's good. I think but not sure it may cut the acid in the tomatoes. Good recipe.

I have made it with both the green peppers added and without the green peppers and it was just as delicious. I add 1/4 teaspoon Cayenne pepper powder and 2 tablespoons Sugar (or to your own liking I like the sweet/slightly spicy flavor). This has become a family favorite and it is even better the next day!!! Be sure to use an 80% lean or higher Ground Beef or it will be greasy.

I'm sure there's a lot of other great meat sauce recipes however this does not disappoint! It was daddy cooking day and  my family loved it. I did follow others suggestion about adding a little sour cream. I also added mushroom and minced spinach leaves. Saved this as a favorite.

Made 30 servings of this for my family and they absolutely loved it!  I also added a little sugar, used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, drained the beef grease before adding the peppers/onion/garlic, and used 85/15 ground beef.

I no longer ever buy a spaghetti sauce in the store.  I set this to cook when I get home, help the kids with homework and then come back to making the spaghetti.  My house is really picky, so I leave out the green peppers.

This is an easy and tasty spaghetti sauce recipe! I substituted spicy hot sausage for the ground beef, mushrooms for the green pepper and used half the tomato paste. Man, so good. Rich, not runny. So, so good.

Really like this recipe and it's easy to make. I add the garlic, onion, and green pepper after the meat (I used 1.5 lbs) is browned (saute in butter with half of seasonings while the meat is draining - then add the beef back in).  I puree the canned diced tomatos (don't care for chunky tomatos) with the other half of the seasonings - add this, tomato sauce and paste to ground beef mixture.  Add a teaspon or sugar, simmer for an hour & serve. Delicious!

So easy and so simple!I left out the green peppers as I can't stand peppers in my spaghetti sauce. Made it one night when I had no jarred sauce. Shared this with my adult children who are embarking on moving to their own residences ( sons and daughter ) - info'd them to stock up on tomatoes, sauces and paste whenever they go on sale....and they will never be without spaghetti sauce. Of course, info'd them to keep garlic and onions on hand too!!

I tried it as is, then made some personal adjustments the second time:  I added a little sugar to cut the acid and remove the bell pepper so my guests don't leave asking for Alka Seltzer and I add 1/4 cup red wine and simmer 2 hours and use an immersion blender to even out the texture as my kids/guests do not like chunks of cooked tomatoes.  We really like it this way.

It smells like absolute heaven. I used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce and the consistency is just the way I like it. I'm also cooking mine much longer, for about 4 hours.

This was good, I have no complaints. It's relatively easy to make too, only the simmer times is sort of long. To make it a one pot meal I added about 8oz of cooked pappardelle noodles, when it was done, and sprinkled the top with a little parmesan cheese. I like that this contained a few vegetables, and found it quite rich and filling, for the calories suggested.

My 13-year-old daughter made this sauce, following the recipe exactly as posted.  It was delicious, and my daughter was so proud of the result that we have now decided that she is the official spaghetti sauce cook in our house.

I used ground turkey, added some red pepper flakes.  Also, used only tomato paste and a can of stewed tomatoes.   It turned out amazing.

Followed the recipe exactly and though it had a pretty good flavor, I agree with a previous reviewer that it was missing something. For my family's tastes, I'll have to continue my search. Also, I don't know if I was supposed to drain the can of diced tomatoes or not, but I didn't get a "saucy" consistency - this didn't coat my pasta the way I'm used to spaghetti sauce coating pasta, the sauce itself had more of a ground-beef-slightly-coated-with-tomato-sauce look, if you can picture it. According to the pictures posted by people who've tried this recipe already, I may have missed something in the execution since it didn't look like this was a problem with anyone else.

This is my go-to recipe for sauce! It's very easy to adapt for personal preferences. I omit the green peppers and cut down a little on the onion. I also use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 sausage for extra flavor.  My family loves it!!

This is a really wonderful recipe! The only changes I made were to leave out the pepper and add a few bay leaves. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe and was very pleased with the results!

Wonderful recipe. Used crushed tomatoes for a smoother sauce, omitted green peppers, half pound of ground beef, added one teaspoon of sugar to cut the acid and one bay leaf. Froze individual containers for single servings. This will be my go-to sauce from now on!

I made this recipe and my husband and daughter absolutely loved it. My husband is very picky with pasta and he actually said it was the best I made. Made it exactly the way it says, just added some italian seasoning, but it was awesome.

Great simple recipe. Easy to adjust to taste. Added more garlic powder and red chili flakes. We also added spicy Italian sausage for more meat. I liked that we had most of the ingredients around the house unlike alot of other recipes.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to omit the green peppers.  I also used the slow cooker.  Great to make a large batch and freeze for later.

Love this as a base pasta sauce! I add the following to it and it makes SUCH a difference: fresh basil, fresh Italian parsley, cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, balsamic vinegar (to cut the acidity), and a bit of parmesan for that depth of flavor.

Great beginner-I used red bell pepper instead of green and that was a hit. Also, added 1/4 cup of red wine to the recipe and let this simmer for 2 hrs instead of 1. Great!

This recipe was fantastic - but I used Johnsonville Italian Sausage instead of using ground beef.  It really added so much depth and flavor of spice!  It was so hearty and delicious.

This was ok...not great, just average. It's a bit too tomato-y for our taste but it was a nice thick sauce, which we like.

Very simple yet delicious. Thank you for this, I used pasta sauce so all I did was the meat, garlic, onion, (skipped green pepper as I ran out of it) as well as the dry herbs. Really tasty, I could've drained the grease better next time and skip at least half of the salt as the pasta sauce is salty enough to begin with.

Perhaps next time I will go all in with your recipe and taste the difference :)

This recipe is delicious!!! My boyfriend loves Italian yet we both have busy schedules that don't allow much time for prep. He's happy with some cooked pasta and a jar of store bought tomato sauce but I can't stand bland. This satisfies both us because it is quick and savory. Thanks you so much for sharing the recipe. I changed nothing as it's wonderful as is.

Whole family loved it.  I didn't have a green pepper, so I skipped it, and it was just as good.  I read some of the reviews ahead of time and decided against making any small tweaks.  Came out quite delicious and will now be in our regular rotation.  I don't want to go back to the jarred stuff, and I was practically raised on Ragu!

I actually choose this recipe because I had a beautiful green pepper that I needed to use. The sauce was so delicious! The only addition I made was a pinch of sugar. The recipe really worked for me beacuse I do not like my ground beef to be too browned. Cooking the beef with the onions, garlic and pepper was brilliant! Next time I will use a can of peeled San Marzano tomatoes and run them through a food mill, because my husband prefers a smoother sauce.

I made this as written with a few suggestions from others such as using crushed tomatoes instead of diced to make it creamier.  I will never buy a bottled sauce again.  I loved it.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

A great base recipe - I didn't add pepper but added mushrooms as that's what I had.  I need to make sure to mix all the spices and salt in properly - some were still stuck on the spatula I was mixing with :S

I made this sauce without ground beef. The sauce was bland. I added more pepper, oregano, and basil. I also added a teaspoon of sugar to help with the acidity of the tomatoes. After my changes, the sauce tasted a little better. I will continue my search of a homemade pasta sauce though.

I and my family loved this recipe. But I use mild sasla instead of can diced tomatoes because I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes and I put Itailan seasoning, basil, salt, pepper and head of caluflower and 2 lbs ground beef in the sauce and it turn out great. I will use this sauce recipe again. 

Thank You, 
In Christ's Love

This is a good base recipe. You can kick it up a notch in complexity by using  Fire Roasted Tomatos along with ground sirloin and season the meat while browning it with lemon pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and salt to taste.

I found this to be a little too tomato-ey. I had to add a couple of large pinches of sugar to balance out the acidity. I won't be making this again.

I have made this sauce so many times in the last year after discovering it on this site.  It is quick, easy, and freezes very well.  I add a bit of sugar to cut the acidity.  Also, sometimes I have made it without the peppers and have not noticed a discernible difference.  I use half ground beef/half sweet Italian sausage, and also prefer to use whole tomatoes, which add more flavor, and break down nicely as the sauce simmers.

Interesting. This is exactly the same recipe I have used for years, with just minor variations. I don't use the green bell pepper. Otherwise the recipe is the same, except I usually add some black olives (whole or chopped) and champignons (chopped if large, whole if small). One ingredient I consider crucial is either a tablesp of vinegar (any vinegar) or a dl of red wine.

I have a similar recipe handed down from my italian Nonna. Skip the peppers and add 2grated carrots, a level tsp of sugar,  and half a glass of red wine. I use passata (sieved tomatoes) instead of diced tomatoes but if thats not available I prefer canned whole tomatoes.

This recipe is wonderful.  We've added a few things:  we use about a pound and a half of ground beef, add a little sugar (less than a tsp), cayenne, chili powder, a bay leaf, and a sprinkle of fennel.  These spices really make the sauce rich.  I wish I could give exact measurements, but I tend to cook by taste.  Give it a try -- it's really good.

I have made a similar version for years which everyone can't believe how good it comes out and how simple it is.  I tried this one and it's very good but I prefer mine variations.  I don't use peppers or italian seasoning (I hate oregano).  I use Stewed tomatoes instead of diced (that's where you get the pepper flavoring).  My seasonings are Mrs. Dash (table blend), Beaumonde (a spice blend from Spice Island) and dried rosemary (about 1/4 tsp crushed in your hand).  I also add about 1-2 Tbl sugar (as noted by one of the reviewers) to bring down the tomato acidity.  Everything else is exactly the same.  Try it either way.  Both are very good recipes.

I expected more from this recipe.  My family and I were sadly disappointed with it.  I followed the recipe as written but the spices overpowered it.

Just had this for dinner and everyone loved it!  The only thing I changed was that I omitted the green pepper as I didn't have one on hand.  I will try it again and add the green pepper.

I leave out the green pepper, as others have said, too. They don't like me and I don't the flavor of them anyway. Green peppers seem to take over the flavor of anything they are in. Great recipe otherwise. Thanks for sharing, Hank's Mom!

This is the same recipe MY mother gave to me!  The only difference is instead of bell pepper, I put in 2 dried chili peppers (and remove them before serving!) and a bay leaf.  We like the little bit of bite the chilis add.  And I agree, everyone loves it!

We cook this a lot, but instead of the peppers we use carrots. We usually add a little red wine (1/4litre) after browning the meat. If you leave it to cool down and heat it just before serving - add some fresh tomatoes and basil leaves, then it turns out perfect. My Boyfriend even likes to leave it to cook for a day.

This recipe was wonderful, The only thing I changed was I added 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes.  I omitted the green pepper.  This sauce was thick and very flavorful.  A couple tsp. of sugar if you like it sweet.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it is my new sauce recipe.

Great, basic spaghetti sauce recipe.  Nice consistency and flavor.  I used Italian seasoning instead of the basil and oregano, and I added crushed red pepper flakes.  Overall very good, and a nice alternative to canned pasta sauce.

My fiance doesn't care for spaghetti, but she asked where I got this sauce and now wants me to prepare it more often.  I left out the pepper and subbed the onion for minced onion.  Great tasting recipe.

Fantastic. I was really craving a simple, yet delicious meat sauce and this definitely fit the bill. I sliced up fresh carrots and mushrooms and added those, along with a little parsley. I will use this recipe again. Thanks! :)

Made this a couple of times now in a larger batch so I could freeze some. I omit the bell pepper as we are not fans and add some cayenne as we like the flavor with a bit of heat. Very easy to make.  I also add sugar...about 1/4 cup but since I use 3 lbs of meat, it isn’t overpowering. Need to calm down the acidity a little.

If you don't like the taste of green pepper, maybe don't add it because it is very strong. I can taste it more so out of everything imo. 

otherwise, I think its a really good dish.
I won't mind making it again. :)

My go to sauce.  Everyone loves it.  I add ground Italian sausage (my husband likes a meaty sauce) and more tomato sauce to compensate the additional meat.  I also use a food processor for the onions and green pepper so they just melt in for people picky about onions.  My kids like it better than their Paw Paw’s sauce which is their highest compliment.  Thank you for posting ??

About a large teaspoon of sugar and a tablespoon of pesto will brighten the flavor and compliment the tomato very well! Good base recipe to play around with, I also added a bit of wine right after cooking the meat

This was really good but tasted like it was missing something. I doubled it and let it simmer for hours. I’ll repeat it but next time I’ll use the Italian diced tomatoes, way more garlic, salt, and pepper.

Made this sauce tonight, didn't have any green peppers but didn't miss them. Took the advice of other viewers and added 1/2 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  Used a potato masher to mash the tomatoes in the pot as I do not like too much chunky pieces. I will never buy jar sauce again, it was amazing!

I am always looking for a nice pasta sauce and this one was really good. Super hearty and flavorful. I added a little red wine and simmered the sauce for 45-minutes on low.

Good basic sauce recipe. I added a 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes to extend it a bit and add texture, 1/2 can of olives, and per other reviews some butter and sugar. Careful not to let it burn when simmering.

It's a really good recipe but I only used it for a general guideline. I doubled most of the recipe but put 18 oz of tomato paste, 23 oz of tomato sauce, 8 tsp of minced garlic, 8 tsp of italian seasoning instead of just oregano and basil, and I didn't double the salt, the onion, or the bell pepper. So I've more or less created my own recipe from this one at this point. This is the second time I've made it and I will be making it again and again.  Next time I'm putting 24 oz of tomato paste and 15 oz of tomato sauce because I like a lot thicker sauce and it still wasn't quite thick enough.

It was really bland and too thick. If I try it again I would use sausage instead of hamburger and put  a whole lot more spices in it,than what it calls for.

This is a "can't get it wrong" spaghetti sauce recipe. I added celery for a minor crunch and mushrooms for added flavor. As others have mentionned, drain your meat first then add the garlic, onions and green peppers and cook a little longer in order to maintain flavor. Excellent sauce.

The flavor was great!  I did have to substitute a can of stewed tomatoes for the tomato sauce, because the 4+ cans of tomato sauce I *thought* I had in my pantry were apparently stolen by goblins, or something.  So this spaghetti sauce probably would have been better with actual tomato sauce, but it was still pretty good! It had a nice, rich texture to it, too.

This is a great basic sauce recipe! I like to add 2 cups of green veggies to the saute (kale, broccoli, zucchini, etc), 1 grated carrot and 1Tbs sugar to balance the tartness. I often will freeze half and it keeps very well.

I increased the recipe 10X making 50 lbs of sauce for 80+ people.

I'm going to serve it tonight so I don't yet have a group consensus but its the best sauce I've ever eaten.....very thick and meaty....mushrooms and bell peppers make it awesome.

1 -6 lb can of Tomato Paste
1- 6 lb can of Tomato Sauce
2 - 6 lb cans of Diced Tomatoes
1 - 6 lb can sliced mushrooms
10 lbs ground beef
5 lbs hot Italian Sausage
1/2 cup dried basil
1/2 cup dried oregano
2 cups diced garlic (from a jar)
10 bell peppers - diced
10 onions - diced
2 Tbsp black pepper
1/8 cup table salt

This is a great recipe base. I have made as directed. However ...this time I took the suggestion of another reviewer to marinate the beef in soy, Worcester and little bit of sugar for 15 minutes. It took this sauce up several levels ...I’ve never made spaghetti sauce that tastes better than restaurant. Thank you for the great recipe and the reviewer who gave such an awesome tip!

Simple and delicious. You'll definitely want to adjust the amount of salt, though. One teaspoon is definitely not enough to make the flavors pop.

Very hearty and comforting. I’m saving this recipe because my parents loved it.

Here are my adjustments: used 4lbs of ground beef; doubled all the seasoning and canned tomato stuff; used fresh basil; 1/2 cup of red wine; 1 bay leaf; spoonful of beef bouillon; 1/2 cup of brown sugar (not packed) and browned the meat before adding garlic/onions. I also cooked this in my instapot. So easy!

This recipie is how I've made my spaghetti sauce for ever! I use Hunts Basil, Garlic & Oregano diced tomatoes, paste & sauce. I also add a pinch of sugar because of the acidity from the tomatoe ingredients. I love to make my sauce the day before & let it simmer for several hours. Now, being from an Italian family I enjoy the simple way of cooking & my family appreciates that I didn't just open a jar & heat it up!...

My grandmother made sauce like this so I am partial to sauce with ground beef.  Very very good!  I like my sauce on the chunky side so the tomatoes were perfect and a whole lot easier than breaking up whole canned tomatoes!  Gram always added mushrooms so I threw a can of those in and I did take the advice of a reviewer and add a teaspoon of sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!  As my husband would say, “put it in the rotation!”

This is a great base recipe, but I did make a few changes (okay I may have totally changed it Lol) and it was delicious! I added 1/2 pound italian sausage. I used 1 tsp. each of basil and oregano, then 2 tsp of Italian Seasoning. I added 1 tsp. Sugar, 1 tsp. olive oil, 1 cup Cabernet wine and between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper (I like a little heat). I also added a package of fresh white button mushrooms (sliced).

This was so easy and absolutely delicious!  I thought spaghetti sauce was only great with the addition of sausage but I was wrong.  I threw everything into a crock pot for 1 hour on high then 2 on low and it was perfect.  I did add a sprinkle of sugar to cut the acidity.  I did not add green pepper because I didn't have any.

I didn't have a can of tomato sauce but I did use 2 (28oz) cans of crushed tomatoes and 1 (6oz) can of paste. I also browned some ground beef after sauteeing the onions and garlic for a little bit then added a little beef and the paste. Cooked the paste for 5 minutes and then added the rest of the ground beef. I accidentally used 2 TBLSP of oregano and 2 TBLSP of basil and 1 TBLSP salt - surprisingly the sauce was not salty and it was seasoned nicely. Thank you for this recipe.

I used fresh peeled deseeded plum tomatoes, garlic, onion and herbs etc to start with a homemade sauce base instead of canned tomatoes then subbed in 80% lean beef in addition to the onion and green peppers without pouring off the grease, simmered with a cabernet and reducing for 45 minutes.

Awesome!! This is a solid, crowd-pleasing recipe. I added half a teaspoon of sugar, but that has nothing to do with the recipe. I only added it because the tomatoes were a bit acidic.

My first attempt at homemade spaghetti sauce. So much better than store bought. I added red wine, brown sugar, and mushrooms. Just a bit of water at the end to loosen it up a bit.

Turned out great!  I added approximately 2 table spoons of Splenda (Sweetener) as someone else suggested.  Ended up adding 1 additional teaspoon salt.  It really good with hamburger meat.  I think  it would be good with Italian sausage also.

This is my new go-to pasta sauce recipe because of how easy and simple it is. If the sauce seems too thin (I like thicker sauces), I leave the lid off of the sauce for the last 15 minutes of simmering.

I actually had to modify this a bit for my liking.  For one, I used some hot Italian sausage along with the hamburger,  In terns of spices I used everything in the recipe, but also included Italian seasoning, onion powder, and felt I had to add much more black pepper for my taste.  The basic recipe is good, but it needs much modification for someone looking for a spicier alternative.  Defiantly recommending this sauce for anyone.  Be prepared to add you twist to make it your own.  Enjoy.

Very yummy. I used a red pepper instead of green and added a few mushrooms.

So tasty. Made meatballs instead of adding ground beef and I’m sure it was equally as tasty. Seriously so tasty.

This is great just as written. My butcher had ground Italian sausage so I used 1/4 of a pound for flavor, 3/4 pound of ground chuck and omitted the pepper for my daughter. And I always add twice the garlic. Only thing I’d do different is sauté the onions some beforehand for my preference. My family was impressed with  the flavor. Thank you Hank’s mom!

I thought this was a very good recipe, made this for my family including a very picky child. They all loved it served it with some garlic bread. I will say it tasted a bit green if that makes any since, It was not bad by any means maybe this was my fault but overall this dish was GREAT! Will cook again!

AMAZING! I made this recipe but added some red pepper flakes for a little heat. Added a tiny bit of parsley and extra basil, oregano, salt and pepper. It came out amazing. One of the best pasta sauces I have ever had.

used mild italian sausage.  Excellent starting recipe for meat sauce.  Needed a little surgar (tomatoes were quite acidic).  Otherwise, tasted great!

My husband could not get enough of this dish. I usually buy sauce in a jar. This was very easy to make. I don't think I'll be buying it in  a jar again. I did mix sour cream in my noodles.

Simple recipe! Most ingredients are pantry staples. 86’d the oregano, added a splash of Worcestershire, a spoonful of sugar, 2 beef bullion cubes, combining some previous comments.

I followed the recipe to a T and it was a hit. My 17-yo who dislikes pasta asked for leftovers the next day.  Easy to make and I already had the ingredients in my pantry.  I will be making again. Thank you for this easy and delicious sauce.

Add sugar to cut down the acidic taste and this is a five star recipe. Our household eats mostly all organic foods and we have yet to find an organic sauce in the store that we enjoyed. I have been making this  for a few months now at least twice a month and everyone in the family prefers this sauce to any we have bought in the store, organic or not.  From time to time I will add mushrooms.

My family is trying to eat healthier, so I wanted to try a homemade spaghetti sauce.  I used no salt added crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce but followed everything else exactly as written.  It was delicious and easy.  Definitely a keeper!

This is pretty yummy! I made the following changes; left out the bell pepper and black pepper, subbed tomato sauce with more diced tomatoes, browned the carrots and seasoned them before adding the tomatoes and tomato paste. I also added some water. Would make this again.

This is my go to meat sauce recipe, I normally make 4 batches to freeze and give away to friends and family.  My husband and I will use leftovers for pizza sauce and sometimes just eat it, sauce alone! This is a simple sauce that has great flavorful results and is a must try.

Outstanding. I skipped the bell pepper due to my kids preference and added a spoonful of sugar, otherwise pretty much as listed. We really enjoyed this and will probably no longer buy pasta sauce. I did simmer for a solid hour because my husband was rolling out fresh pasta (I was done long before he was).

This sauce is really good!  I made it as is, except for the beef I used some leftover taco meat that I had in my freezer.  This gave it alot of flavor!  Will definitely make again!  it actually doesn't make alot so when I make it again I'll make a triple batch so I have some I can put in the freezer. It freezes really well.   So good!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I used a  1/2 pound more ground beef than the recipe called for and I used crushed tomatoes  instead of diced and I added 16 oz. of mushrooms.
Besides that I stuck to the script.
My mom said it's better than her recipe. Great spaghetti sauce! Loved it.

Followed recipe but left out bell pepper, which I detest, and added a splash of red wine near the end.  I have made it several times, served it over pasta and over zoodles!  Love it, great go to dish that I can put together in no time and it really doesn't take an hour to simmer it, I've done half an hour. Freezes well.

Made as written other than changing serving size to sixteen. This had a good deep flavor and wife, grandkids and I really enjoyed it. I think this will be my go to recipe for meat sauce. I do like tow make mine with a pound of ground chuck and Italian    sausage.

I followed the exact recipe and I just thought it had a bitter burnt flavor to it. I've made other sauces from this site and they were all great but since this one had way less ingredients and was a lot simpler to make I thought I'd try it. I just couldn't handle the flavor. Even the non picky bf didn't like it.

I was looking for an easy spaghetti sauce this evening and found this one. My husband was trying to add all these different ingredients lol and told him I want to try this recipe and the ingredients it calls for.  The only thing we left out were the green peppers. It  tasted excellent and we kept taste testing it while the sauce was simmering. We will make again! Thank you Hank’s mom!

I did put my own little spin but my sisters and I are a fan. Since I am watching my diet, I did use whole grain pasta but overall great dish for a family dinner. 

PS. I had no left overs

My family liked it a lot after I doctored it. As made was too tomatoey for our taste.  Everybody has different tastes but I added 1 tsp of red chili flakes, 1 extra teaspoon of basil and oregano and 2 teaspoons of sugar.  I also threw in hot italian chicken sausage.  The base was super easy and I had everything in my cupboard which was great!

This was so very good! I didn't use all the tomato paste, only 3/4 can.  Next time I'd use maybe just half of it as it tends to make it a little too thick for us and tomato tasting. I added about a tablespoon sugar to it and some seasoning salt and parmesan cheese.  I also added a little more than a 1/4 C. water to thin it out and some added pasta water at the end.  You've GOT to try this recipe!

I've been using the same spaghetti sauce recipe for years - but when my kids said "Mom, this is the best spaghetti sauce you've ever made" on a night I used something out of a jar - I started looking for a new recipe and found this one.  

I did add mushrooms when I browned the meat,  added a little sugar in the seasoning stage, and fresh herbs instead of dried.  It was delicious and has now become "the new best spaghetti I ever made!"  I think simmering for an hour is key - you could not taste any of the "canned" acidic flavors you can sometimes taste in quicker sauces.  It was the perfect thickness and a wonderful mellow flavor.  I should note that I don't think any of the items I added were necessary - just a matter of personal taste!

Easy to make because I usually have these ingredients in my kitchen.  I added 2 T. soy sauce, 1/4 t. salt, 1/2 t. sugar and 2 t. Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef before I sautéed it with  the onions and garlic, as another reader advised.  I do not like green peppers, so did not add them, but did add a small can of sliced olives. Also, I like my sauce a bit spicy, so I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  I put it all in my crock pot on high for 3 hours.  My husband and I loved it! Thank you!!

Great basic recipe! I browned the ground beef along with the onion, garlic and pepper in my crock pot. Added crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and one can of tomato sauce (because that all I had) along with the spices and slow cooked for 6 hours. I did add some red pepper flakes and a pinch of sugar.....turned out perfect!

I used two 12.5 oz's of diced tomatoes, 1 15 oz tomato sauce. I also browned my meat first then saute'd the onions, green peppers, and garlic in a tablespoon or so of olive oil, poured the tomato mixture in with them and added the rest of the ingredients to let the sauce simmer and flavors mix. I then mixed it all together, including noodles, which I used Penne, and put it in the crock pot for dinner later. Yum, this sauce was delicious!

Very nice and easy recipe. I used fresh tomatoes and home made tomato sauce.  I also added mushrooms to recipe.  There was great flavour but no punch.  Next time I'll add chilie flakes or other hot spice.  This ones a keeper.

This was excellent. I liked because it was quick and had great flavor. I followed recipe as written. I did add a quarter tsp of red hot pepper flakes as suggested at the end of video. The 1/4 tsp red hot pepper flakes gave it a slight kick without being too spicy. I think next time I might reduce salt by half as it did initially taste a little too salty. After simmering for 1 hour the salt did seem to blend in better.

I used turkey Italian sausage, added red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, fresh zucchini,  squash, and carrots. I also had to substitute part of the diced tomatoes for crushed tomatoes; I only had a 14.5 oz can of the diced.

I added a lot more garlic. It was excellent. Now I will make a big batch of it and freeze half of it. My son isn't a huge fan of most sauces, but seems to really like this one.

Hoped to like this much more than I did.  Made exactly as directed with no changes.  Was just "okay" to me and my adult kids, but we thought it was missing "something." My husband really liked it though. Would probably try it again and tweak it  a bit.

I halfed the recipe which made 3-4 servings. Added 1 tsp sugar to cut the tined tomato acidic taste and added another garlic cloves. Added 400 g tin of diced tomatoes and no more tomato anything.
Next time I will mix garlic w the meat and let sit for a bit to marinate, so flavour mixes better into the meat.
Boyfriend liked it.

I didn't have ground beef or tomato sauce, so I used meatballs and added about 3 tsp of sugar to reduce the acid content. It came out good; my husband said so!

I had company coming for supper so needed a quick recipe and one that had all the ingredients in the cupboard.  I made this sauce and it was enjoyed by everyone.  The only thing I did differently was add fresh basil, parsley and oregano from the garden.  Great recipe.

Enjoyed this sauce. Thick and chunky. Made it exactly as written. It made six healthy  servings, enough to freeze for another meal and to have left overs  as we are a two person household. I w I'll add a few red pepper flakes next time.

Was making a basic sauce when I thought of checking for spices I could add when I came across this. Had already added a can of spaghetti sauce so left out the tomato sauce and went with rest.
I came out with something tasting different which is exactly what I wanted.
Next time I'll use tomato sauce

This is a great quick recipe to throw together in no time at all.  I doubled the recipe.  I added a lb of pork burger to mine along with the hamburger.  The flavour is develops over time so I made it a day ahead of using it.  Just my preference.  I'm  not a big pasta person so I serve it over baked and shredded spaghetti squash.

I don't cook but need a hobby so I decided to make this. Super easy and delicious! Instead of basil and oregano I just dashed in some generic Italian seasoning I had handy.

This was really good. Left green pepper out as don't like them  cooked. Consistency is good. I would definitely make this again. I used lean ground beef so grease not a problem.  Had no diced tomatoes so used canned plum tomatoes and pulsed a couple of times in processer.  Next time will add some mushrooms with onions. Yum.  Great recipe.

This will be my go to for meat sauce. I did make a couple of changes. I cooked 3+ lbs. of ground beef. I doubled the spices and added some chilli powder. I also added 16 oz. of white mushrooms. I also used a 102 oz. can of diced tomatoes

I made this with crushed tomatoes instead of diced. It was a thick sauce and tasted good. Because it was quite tomatoey I added a tsp of sugar. The longer this simmers the better. I cooked it in the slowcooker for a few hours.

The only thing I did outside the recipe was I added a half can of water as the sauce was just a bit thick. I then let it simmer until all the added water was evaporated. The sauce was outstanding.

This is hands down one of the best dishes I've made. The only change I made was I used half an onion and half a green pepper instead of a whole. This will now be a staple in our house.

This is a very good base recipe and I will use it again. You can get as creative as you want with it. I did not have tomato sauce so I used tomato juice and it worked fine, I adjusted the amount so it wasn't too watered down. I also like to let my sauce simmer for a few hours so the flavors are really absorbed.

This is my new spaghetti recipe!!!  I'm not a pepper fan so I didn't add them to the recipe. Also used a half jar of spaghetti sauce (Prego) instead of the can of  tomato sauce.  Great flavor and will definitely make again!!!

This was good and passed the picky-husband test. I read one other post that recommended adding a bit of sugar, soy sauce, and Worcestershire Sauce and mixing that into the ground beef to sit for a bit. I was happy with the results. In the future, I think I'll make a large batch and freeze it, since I'm used to opening a jar, lol.

Reminded me of the spaghetti sauce i grew up with.  Made as listed.  It tended to be a little sweeter than i prefer these days so may balance it with some cayenne next time.  Good family sauce.

I made this sauce in my crockpot. After I made the pasta, I drained it and put it in with the sauce on the “Keep Warm” setting. This made it possible to easily transport to our church youth group who devoured it. They loved the sauce!

Very good "go to" recipe for traditional spaghetti sauce! I had all the ingredients on hand and the flavor was great - even better the next day. It made a good batch so I was able to freeze some for a quick dinner. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was just ok for us.  It was very acidic as is.   I prepared the recipe as stated and it seemed bland to us.  I am rating the recipe 3 stars as prepared.  We added some red pepper flakes, a little Italian seasoning, and a couple of pinches of sugar to cut the acidity.  With changes I would rate it a 4. I probably won't make again because I like my go to recipe better.   It is an easily adaptable recipe to your taste though if you want to tweak the recipe after tasting as prepared.

I’m not going to lie - I’ve made this exactly the way the recipe says a couple of times, Amazing.  I’ve also made it the lazy way about...weekly!  The lazy way is where I follow the recipe with the ground beef, onion, garlic but then toss in a jar of marinara sauce to simmer. Still a great way to spice up an otherwise somewhat bland spaghetti dinner!

I used crushed tomato instead of diced and added  a teaspoon of sugar.  I also put a small amount of water in the sauce.  (About a tomato paste can worth.). Good easy recipe.

This is our favorite spaghetti sauce. We have been making it for a couple of years. We like meat so I increased the ground round to 1.5 lbs and add an additional can of tomato sauce.

I love this super easy basic but tasty meat sauce. 

I have a kiddo with texture issues so I use crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I cut the acidity of all the tomatoes with a Tbsp of sugar and I add a bay leaf to the sauce while it simmers. 

Sometimes I get extra and use 1 pound of ground beef and 1/2 pound of mild Italian sausage. Either way, with to without the sausage, it is a good easy delicious meat sauce. I like how it sticks to the noodles. The sauce  is hearty and I use bucatini instead of spaghetti noodles.

Nice thick sauce. I made a few changes. I used 3/4 pound ground beef and 1/2 pound Italian sausage. I also substituted a poblano pepper for the green pepper.  Because I don't like a lot of chunky tomatoes, I switched the large can of diced tomatoes for a can of tomato sauce and also switched the small can of tomato sauce for a small can of diced tomatoes. This is now my go-to recipe for spaghetti sauce.

This was super-easy and delicious!  I made it in a pinch so I didn't have the specified hour to let it simmer, and undoubtedly that would have made it even better.  I left out the ground beef and simmered it with frozen meatballs from Costco instead, left out the green peppers, and added 1/2 tsp of sugar.  Minor changes that were due to using what I had on hand, making the recipe even simpler.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I make this all the time, except I use ground veal and it really makes the sauce pop and feel more rustic.   I also add fresh mushrooms and zucchini which makes it a nice chunky sauce!   Try the veal!  ;-)

Hands down the best sauce I've ever had. Have made it multiple times with ground beef, chicken and sausage. The ground spicy sausage was the best. I did follow the advice of a previous reviewer and used a teaspoon of sugar. Definitely helps with the acidity. Just remember, the longer you let it simmer, the better it tastes.

I hate making changes the first time, but I did not have any diced or crushed tomatoes.  I did have a couple of fresh tomatoes that were a little overripe, so I put them in the food processor to crush a little and threw them in.  Simmered for two hours, and then tasted.  Seasoning seemed a little lacking, so I added a little Italian seasoning, a little crushed red pepper, and a little Parmesan cheese ... an hour more simmering, and flavor was great!  Probably because I had less tomatoes in it, it was a little too thick, but we enjoyed it on spaghetti, and I froze about half for a later date.

This is delicious just the way it is written. I made it but did not have green pepper so I omitted it, but it was still excellent.  I made it for company so I kept the recipe as written. But I like a little more heat so I think if making for myself and husband I will add some wine and red pepper flakes. Very good!

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I added a little brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. I also added mushrooms and olives. I cooked the tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, olives, mushrooms, sugar and herbs with a little salt, pepper, garlic, and dehydrated onion. together for a couple days in my crock pot to get the flavors all  nice and combined and then cooked my meat,  fresh onion and bell pepper together with more garlic and salt and pepper.  It is fabulous.

Very nice base to use. I always double the recipe and add two stalks of very finely chopped celery and a package of chopped fresh mushrooms. I also about a 1/8 cup of chocolate chips. Gives it a nice dark flavor and helps to break up the acidity.

I made this for the first time tonight and will only use this recipe in the future.  My husband and I both loved it.  Perfect consistency and the flavor is better than the spaghetti I always order at our favorite Italian restaurant.  I left out the garlic, basil and oregano only because I already had canned diced tomatoes with those ingredients included and it still came out amazing.  Served with warm garlic sticks and freshly grated parmesan cheese ~ doesn't get any better!

Instead of canned diced tomatoes, I had some chunky sauce I made from fresh tomatoes from my garden. For spaghetti sauce I needed to get to the next step--and this was it. Delicious and easy. Thank you Hank's mom!  An easy way to lose the grease without losing the onion and garlic is to just push the beef and veggies to one side of the pan and then tilt it and spoon out the grease.

This is my go to spaghetti sauce recipe. I do leave out the green pepper sometimes. My family enjoys it both ways.

Upon first bite, my eight-year screamed out, "MOM! This tastes like heaven!" Enough said. Simple, relatively quick, and delicious results. I made a triple batch. Consider me a happy mom.

The recipe is nice as is, but I add sugar  to cut the acidity from the tomatoes and during the simmering process also add fennel seed and a bay leaf which just takes the sauce to the next level.

This is how I've been doing my spaghetti sauce for years. In my case, I brown the ground beef first then drain excess oil. This way, the onion and garlic flavor won't be lost with the drained oil. After that, I add the garlic and onion, and sauté til onion is translucent and garlic is brown. Then I add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, plus a teaspoon each of dried basil, parsley, oregano, rosemary, and thyme. Add some salt and freshly ground black pepper and some red pepper flakes for a kick. It's really good as this. For a change, sometimes I would add mushrooms, parmesan cheese, or cream. Still turns out pretty good.

I usually use Ragu because every time I've made a homemade recipe, it never tasted good to my family.  I realized yesterday that I had no sauce and decided to try another homemade recipe.   I found this recipe and made it.  I didnt have enough time to let it simmer so I microwaved it for about 5 minutes.  I did add a to of sugar like others suggested.  The taste and the consistency was perfect.

This recipe doesn't need any more rave reviews, but we loved it so much that I felt impelled to submit mine. I don't usually use exact measurements, but use what is most convenient to me. I have my own tomato sauce from my delicious garden tomatoes. Each container holds about the amount of a 14-oz can (US). Where I live, tomato paste is much more concentrated than in the US, so I added the appropriate amount of water to dilute it, when the sauce seemed to be getting too thick. I followed the advice of several reviewers and added a bay leaf (fresh from our tree),  about 3 anchovies (sauteed with garlic  & onion), a little red wine, and some red pepper flakes. I believe that these additions enhanced an already excellent recipe.  For those who think I should make the recipe exactly as written, I say "nonsense!" - I simply want to make the best possible food for my family and friends. I have to say that my family loved this recipe and is looking forward to leftovers tonight. I served it with Barilla brand whole wheat spaghetti (No.5) which was delicious.

I followed the recipe without any changes.  The sauce has an incredible flavor and will be my go to spaghetti sauce from now on.  I used the sauce for a casserole  and added mozzarella, ricotta and parmesan and baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  
Excellent recipe!

My Hubby loved this! I did add 1/4 cup of red wine, 1 bay leaf and homemade Italian seasoning after draining grease from ground beef. I also added 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese prior to serving.

I would definitely keep this recipe on hand for the future! Great flavor. My boyfriend and I loved it. I added some red pepper flakes for a little heat and used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I let it sit on the stove top on low heat for hrs. Fresh Parmesan cheese on top of the dish makes it perfect!

I love this recipe - it tastes like you've been slaving over the stove for hours like I used to think you had to in order to get a decent sauce.  I've made a lot of spaghetti sauces throughout the years and this is the only one I make now.  Sometimes I make it with meatballs if I have the time and of course, I always top it with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  I love that it freezes well so a quick and easy dinner is ready within minutes.

It is delicious!
I didn't change anything really other than using garlic from the jar, about 5 teaspoons, a teaspoon of sugar, and a bit of cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes. I wanted a bit of heat to it.  I also added worstechire sauce to the meat when cooking it to add a bit more flavor. I used two cans of tomato paste and two cans of tomato sauce because when I was looking at it, it looked like the meat was really out weighing the sauce. I plan to freeze some for later use. Wonderful recipe!

I skipped out on the ground beef; way too acidic, possibly from all the canned tomato  items.

I enjoyed this quick and easy recipe.  It was a little acidic so I plan to put in a bit of sugar next time as one reviewer recommended.  I accidentally used a can of roasted garlic tomato paste instead of regular tomato paste so it was a little garlicky but that was my bad.  I might replace the peppers next time with mushrooms since my husband didn't love them.  In general it was good and I will make it again with a few changes.

This is the very first time I've made homemade spaghetti sauce, and now I'm wondering what took me so long!  This recipe was so, so good!  The only change I made was to omit the green pepper (since I didn't have any) and not letting it simmer (since I didn't have time).  Even so, it was incredibly flavorful.  The friends I made it for raved about it.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a good recipe, not a great, but good. I'm giving it 5 stars for being good and fast and that is rarely the case. You get one or the other but rarely both. It's been taste tested by friends and family and everyone likes it so it's a keeper at this house. It's my go to for relatively quick sauce and it NEVER fails. Love that.

This is an easy recipe. Tasted great. I left out the tomato paste and used the diced tomatoes and pasta sauce. I will add mushrooms next time. One thing though I cooked the meat first then sautéed the onions etc then added back the meat so that you don't lose the garlic and onion flavor

This is an outstanding sauce. A perfect platform that will accept your personal changes. I used crushed tomatoes, rather than diced. A quarter cup of red wine, and 1/2 teaspoon of fennel seed. No matter what your preference is this recipe is a great starting point.

This turned out great! My fiancé is Italian by heritage and is a pasta guru and he said it tasted like his mom made it!!!! I don't cook much so this was a big confidence boost. I used a few of the tweaks from previous comments and we all loved it. Will definitely make it again.

I absolutely love this spaghetti and make it all of the time for my grandmother and myself. I don't use the peppers since I'm not really a pepper person in general, and I also add a bit of parmesan cheese and sugar while it is cooking to give a little extra flavoring.

I substituted the healthier option of ground turkey and it turned out sublime. Due to lack of onions in the house I had only added half of the onion needed, still tasted great, my kids hate onions anyways. Next time I'm going full vegetarian, (I want to have a friend for dinner and they're picky!) and substituting mushrooms, carrots, and celery for meat . Thoughts?

Very easy and tasty, Used ground pork and ground turkey/chicken, doubled the recipe with seasoning etc and it was a big hit.  I added baby carrots and spinach at the end. Other than that followed exactly.

Great recipe! I used pre-minced garlic and a red pepper instead of green (what I had on hand).  Next time I might add a little sugar like other reviewers suggest but it was really delicious as is. Much better than our local restaurant. I'm so happy that I found this simple recipe. Thank you!

Good base, but can be much better. Add Rosemary to the mince/onions/garlic. Added Worchestershire, Red Wine, Beef Stock Cube, along with Capsicum Annum when I simmered (for well over an hour!!!). Also (had to) use Ketchup instead of the tomato paste. Think the sugar in the worchestershire and ketchup helped. Was quite nice. It's good to have lots of flavours on hand, don't you think? Will try marinating the mince with shouyu (soy sauce) and worchestershire next time. probably will be even better.

This is a pretty good recipe.  However, it needs more ground pepper and salt for my and my family's tastes.  Of course, my pepper may have been old and thus flavorless, or I should have caramelized the veggies separately from the meat.  I followed the recipe though.

Was pretty good. Accidentally added a pinch of sage (oops) cause I didn't read labels, but it actually worked! I didn't put as much diced tomatoes in it either, and cooked in in a slow cooker for a few hours. With some slight tweaks, could be good.

Substituted ground pork for the ground beef, boiled 3 small tomatoes and blended them with an 8oz. can of tomatoe sauce. The sauce was so delicious my roommate and I had seconds of spaghetti with this meat sauce. Will make again.

Thank you for the recipe. Have always used jar sauce and was happy in how easy it was to follow and make the recipe. We added some lean hamburger to the mix and just a little of brown sugar. Didn't have peppers to add but will try that the next time! Definitely will use again.

This was pretty good.. I made this as is the first time... it was great.
But after that I tweak the recipe a bit. First I removed the green bell pepper (coz I hate bell pepper), add italian sausage with the ground beef, used crush tomatoes instead of diced, double the amount of tomato sauce and tomato paste.

I have fixed this several times and it is great how it is! However, if you fry your beef with Montreal steak seasoning, it will give the sauce a really nice flavor. Also, if you find your sauce is a little thick,  add a little beef broth .

This could be a great sauce. I will say the amount of oregano was too overpowering for this recipe. A few tweeks and this will be great.

I have used this recipe a few times and I love it! My husband and I are usually so stuffed after eating we can't move. It's a simple base so  it's easy to add whatever you want to make it yours. I always opt for fresh basil and oregano. I also add sugar to cut the acidity of the tomato, along with extra salt and a tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes. NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM

I've never made pasta sauce, and with this recipe, I've made it several times.  This is a great recipe....fine to make it 'as is' but it's easy to make modifications (I usually don't make it with ground beef).
I love a thicker sauce, and it's hard to use sauce from a jar after making this recipe.

Very good sauce. I added a small can of sliced olives and a lot of mushrooms. I was told the mushrooms were key. I think in the future I might also add a pinch of sugar because a little sweetness might help.

After trying this recipe, I've never used spaghetti sauce out of the can again! I follow the receipt to a tee except I brown the meat first, drain the grease off, then add the vegetables and cook till tender. I also add a tsp of sugar to cut out some of the acidity of the tomatoes

I'm not the biggest fan of chunky tomatoes, so I used crushed tomatoes rather than diced. I also added a hit of Red pepper flake for a little heat. Came out great. I love that this is so thick and full of great beef flavor. It paired really well with both spaghetti and fettuccine. I will definitely use this as my base sauce for the future, although I may add mushrooms next time.

Really enjoyed making this sauce! All I did differently was cook the beef first, drained it then added the veggies. Also added some red pepper and carrots! Also added 2teaspoons of sugar to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes! This sauce was super easy to make and me and my boyfriend loveeed it!

This is a good spaghetti sauce, however I  think for my family's taste buds next time I won't add as much oregano and I added 2 tsp sugar.

Pretty good basis for spaghetti sauce. I always drain my beef before I add anything into it. Also added some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes for a spicy kick.

This turned out quite well. I used my pressure cooker to make this. I also added about a half cup of water to this recipe. I will make this again. I might play around a little with the spices but this is one of the best spaghetti sauce recipes I have tried.

First time to make this dish and I really enjoyed it ! Easy to make and can just let it simmer while you do other work. I read some of the comments below and took some suggestions and also made my own adjustments:

ADD: Sauce: 2 tsp sugar or one twirl of honey on top 
ADD: Meat: 2 tsp soy sauce, salt, pepper (marinate 10 min before)
SUB: Instead of 28oz of canned diced tomato and 16oz tomato sauce, I switched the two and found the sauce compared to others pictures was much smoother and nicer
SUB: Penne instead of Spaghetti!!! Very nice mix up to the regular spaghetti and meat sauce

Used this recipe for the first time today and it's a hit! I used Papa George's sausage instead of beef and I used fire roasted diced tomatoes. This particular brand of sausage is significantly lower in fat than most and has much better flavor. There was no fat to drain off after browning. This will be my go to sauce from now on.

I liked it. I wish it were a little less acidic and a little more creamy. I noticed someone posted suggesting to use a little sugar to cut the acidity and cream to thicken. I may try this next time. I also wonder if a little corn starch in some milk would do this. I'm still giving it five stars because it is an easy recipe that turns out nice and can be tweaked many ways to make it your own. A good "base".

I had some Hunt's Thick & Rich spaghetti sauce, so I used that instead of all the tomato stuff for this first try. It turned out very well. Used two 680ml cans. Also threw in some diced mushrooms.

Make something similar. I add fennel and rosemary.  As is I feel it is missing something it gets a 4 star instead of 5 star.

I made this for dinner last week and it came out perfect!! There was a lot of sauce left over so I froze it for another time. I'm a bit lazy when it comes to a bunch of different seasonings, so I just put Italian seasoning that has it all in it and I thought it was delicious.

Hands down the best sauce I have ever made! The girl I was cooking for doesn't like red meat, so I browned the onion, green pepper, and garlic in some vegetable oil and followed the recipe from there. Next time I will try it with ground beef!

I made a few changes based on what I had available. I used ground turkey instead of beef and rosemary instead of basil. Otherwse, I followed the recipe. The results were what typical spaghetti tastes like in my opinion. Nothing to rave about and I was looking for something to jazz things up, so that was a disappointment. However, it didn't taste bad at all so I gave it four stars since the recipe did come out as intended. I just wasn't blown away.

Great recipe! I didn't bother draining the beef though, as it just seems like such a waste to throw out all that flavor. The tomato paste did a fine job thickening the sauce even without draining it. I also added a bit of sugar so it wouldn't be so canned tomato tangy. Tasted amazing on my cheesy macaroni :d

I made this according to the recipe except for using red and orange peppers instead of green and using one can of crushed tomatoes in place of one of the diced. Both were what I had in the pantry. This turned out very good except for needing a little sugar (stevia in my case) to cut the tart, acidic flavor.

I always crave spaghetti, but my husband isn't a huge fan. Made spaghetti with this sauce and now he's hooked! So good and amazing flavor!

I will definitely make this recipe again. Very good base recipe that you can play around with. I added white wine after draining the ground beef, reduced almost completely and then add tomatoes. I roasted fresh and canned tomatoes for 15-20 minutes.A couple of tablespoons of butter will really add huge depth of flavor, I added if after the tomatoes and sauce started bubbling. For the last 30 minutes I added the rind off a small block of parmesan. I also added a small amount of fish sauce (ran out), I would've added anchovies instead, but I didnt have those. Oh and of course I added a couple cloves of garlic extra. It turned out amazing, best meat sauce I have ever had, my girlfriend agreed, her mom also tripped out when she tried some leftovers this morning

I have made this three times. It's a little bland and the tomato is overpowering. I will try adding sugar and some more spices as other reviewers have suggested. Good base recipe.

I took this already wonderful recipe and made it my own with the addition of a few of my favorite ingredients. I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, added about 2 Tbsp of sugar, a splash of red wine, 1 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 Tbsp of butter to the sauce. Definitely my go-to spaghetti sauce from now on!

This recipe is delicious as is. Each time I've made it I add something new and it still tastes great. I like to use a can of diced tomatoes already seasoned with basil. Since I have a toddler who is picky about veggies, I found she likes to pick them out of this sauce and actually EAT them, so in addition to the bell peppers I throw in some sautéed mushrooms, diced zucchini, diced carrots and fresh spinach (it wilts down as it all simmers). We love it! I also do half ground turkey and half Italian sausage, and I add a couple tablespoons of sugar. I'm rating the original recipe, which is great as is, but just sharing my personal twist that makes it just as good. Next time I make lasagna I think I may use this instead of adding a jar of sauce to my meat. It's probably a lot healthier! Thanks for the great recipe! My family loves it!

This was very good. The only change I made was to use mushrooms instead of the bell pepper as I was out. I personally rate this 4*, but the rest of my family gobbled it up and my husband who doesn't usually appreciate ground meat dishes told me he liked it, which means he loves it, so I thought due to that it deserved the 5* rating. Will make again.

!st year garden gave me more tomatoes than I know what to do with.     I didn't do much measuring (rarely do) but got it close, then added portabella caps.  Didn't need any tomato paste as I let her simmer all day.    MMMM!

This is a great traditional sauce, and I made it exactly according to the recipe, except that I substituted Prego tomato & mushroom sauce for tomato sauce.  Prego also has a sausage and garlic sauce that would be good with this recipe. (Or Italian sausage could be added to the ground beef.) I found the sauce sweet and mild enough without adding 1 tsp of sugar, as one reviewer suggested. Thanks for sharing!

Very easy to make if you have some time inyour hand. I added a couple of tsp of sugar and a pinch of baking soda to soften the edges of the sourness from all the tomatoes. Added a pinch of allspice, cumin and cinnamon powder for some flavor. Added fresh basil instead of dried since I had them handy. Excellent outcome, kids devoured it!

This is really good! We've been searching for a new spaghetti sauce for a while, and I think this is it! It's even better if you put a can of petite diced tomatoes in it after adding the rest of the ingredients.

This recipe is one that I have used for years and it is always well received.  Optional additions include  deglazing  with red wine and adding sauteed mushrooms.  Adding a half pound of Italian sausage  yields a rich and flavorful variation.  The additions are all very much optional and show the versatility of the basic recipe.

This is a good basic sauce, I added 2 bay leaves because they always improve a good meat sauce, but the basic recipe is a first rate jumping off point.  I would add mushrooms next time if I have them, just because they too can only make it yummier.  
Suggestions from an old cook: 
 If you like sausage,  but don't have any, add some (a teaspoon or so) crushed fennel. I didn't this time, but it was great to fool my ex-I loathe sausage, he loved it. I don't mind fennel.

This is a great recipe for a new cook. You can learn what works for you and tweak it as you prefer. To all those who wonder about what is missing who did follow the recipe, I would say, add bay leaves!  This sauce would be fine without it, but I put it in every red sauce.

Leaving out peppers or salt or whatever you don't like and complaining about the taste "missing" something is kind of funny. YEAH, you are missing something. The RECIPE!  

Please don't give it a bad rating because you used jarred spaghetti sauce and changed it entirely. Its not fair to the person who took the time to post this lovely recipe.

I had meatballs premade and needed a red sauce to use. 
I cooked diced onions, green peppers and garlic and added different tomato sauces I had (whole peeled tomatoes, tomato paste, and a cut up roma tomato. Used the seasoning as written and also added a little sugar.

I did like this sauce, but I wouldn't say that I loved it. It was missing something, but I'm not quite sure what?? Maybe sugar. I definitely like my spaghetti sauces a little sweeter. I think I'll probably make it again and add a healthy dose of sugar! Meanwhile, I will continue my quest for the perfect spaghetti sauce.

Great recipe! I always season the meat as I'm browning it, so that part was different, but the sauce was made true to the recipe, with one other exception. As per a tip on another review, I added a teaspoon of sugar.  Everything came out absolutely fantastic.  This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

This was very a very easy and delicious recipe.  The only thing I changed was.  I used ground turkey and I let it simmer in the crock pot.   I didn't want to heat up my kitchen.  My family loved it and I will make again maybe double the recipe so I can freeze it for later.

I have made this for years I didn't know there was a recipe for it,  sometimes I add mushrooms and mini pepperoni's and I also add grated parmesan cheese to the sauce (which my family loves).  I love basil so I add a little bit more than this recipe calls for

I found this about 2 years ago and make it often now. It is always a hit with my boyfriend and roommate, and was even a big hit when my boyfriend's kids were visiting. And if it wasn't pizza, mac & cheese, or chicken nuggets, they wouldn't eat it. But they loved this spaghetti. Only thing I changed was the green peppers to mushrooms and I added a bay leaf and some red pepper flakes. My stomach had issues with the green peppers in the sauce. I think I like how it tastes more too. Everything else I followed to a T. Love it!

My mother-in-law gave me this recipe back in Oh Dark Hundred. It has been the base recipe for many of my recipes with tomato sauce. It can't be harmed. I have added fresh basil. I have made it without the green pepper if I didn't have it on hand. I have stretched it by adding tomato sauce and more oregano and basil. It always makes me remember the best mother-in-law anyone could have.

I have made this same sauce for many years and my family & friends love it.  The only thing that I add is a little bit of brown Sugar.  Grandkids say that grandma's spaghetti sauce is the greatest.

Excellent sauce. I added a handful of black olives and some fresh mushrooms (all chopped) because my wife is from New Jersey and says it's not spaghetti sauce without them. I will make it again and again.

I tried this 2 ways: as spec and tried Melody Yeung's  marinated ground beef variation.  Melody was right, the ground beef gave a bolder impact without taking away from the dis's intention.  My wife sometimes has trouble with the acidity of spaghetti sauce, so I've found that by adding some jarred Alfredo sauce, usually a 4 cheese version, it cuts the acidity and adds an additional level of richness and the whole family likes it as well.

This has been my husband's favorite since the 1950's when his Mom got it out of a Betty Crocker cookbook and I t's stood the test of time because it's a very good, hearty sauce. The only change I make is to add a tablespoon of brown sugar to offset the acid in the past and enrich the base. White sugar works but brown sugar is best. Sometimes I omit the green pepper since I don't care for it and it's still fine. In summer when we have fresh tomatoes I'll use ours and it takes it to another level. I often make more because it freezes well and is great to have on hand.

I make spaghetti similarly to this, but I also used Italian sweet sausage and hot Italian sausage.  I use fresh herbs and spices which really makes a huge difference.  I brown the sausages in one pan, then brown the ground sirloin.  I put this in a very large frying pan and set aside.  I saute' 1 chopped vadalia onion, 3 cloves garlic, chopped fine, 1 bunch celery, chopped fine, and one green pepper chopped fine in olive oil until tender.  I add this to the meat mixture.  I then add 1 large can of stewed tomatoes, drained, I large can tomato sauce, 1 can tomato paste, 1 large can tomato soup and fresh basil and oregano, 3-4 cups sliced mushrooms and 2 bay leaves.  Mix gently with wooden spoon and simmer on low for 4-6 hours with lid on pan.  It takes time, but it is so worth it.

Prepare garlic bread while spaghetti is cooking and your dinner will all be ready to serve when this is done.

I usually make a basic salad of tomatoes, lettuce, and possibly some chopped celery and bacon bits.  I mix Miracle Whip with a bit of milk and a shake of Hunts catsup.  This is a lighter version of thousand island dressing and goes well with the spaghetti dinner.

This started out as my mother's basic recipe and I added to it over the years.  My sons still come running for this.  I usually make a double or triple batch so they can take enough home to their family for a meal.

Homemade spaghetti has always been my favorite dish. I got a craving for it and was looking for a recipe similar to my mother's, but less complicated. I like a very flavorful sauce so I took Melody's advice and added a little Worcestershire sauce to the meat before cooking. I also added sliced mushrooms and left out the green peppers to appease my husband. It. Is. Perfect!! Hits the spot!

The whole family loved this sauce. I subbed crushed tomatoes for diced, diced red pepper for green (all I had), and added a tsp of sugar. Nice hearty sauce.

This was an easy, tasty recipe.  I usually use bottled spaghetti sauce, so this was a nice, change, and something I plan to use again.  I followed the directions, but also made a few ingredient changes.  Not having green peppers, I added scallions and fresh mushrooms.  I also added a few fresh peas and a sprinkle of sugar. I didn't have tomato paste which would have made the sauce thicker, so I want to include it next time.  I also used stewed tomatoes which I diced.

It has the basics for a great sauce with the right thickness and consistancy but something was missing.  One green pepper, 1/2 cup finely chopped and fried mushrooms and 1 tsp oregeno would complete this on my second attempt and 4 hours in the slow cooker.

This recipe has become my standard for spaghetti sauce. It's SO good in fact that I recently went to a very nice upscale local Italian restaurant and discovered that their sauce was horrible! I'd put this sauce against theirs any day!   Freezes really well too. I did take advice from others and add 1 tsp of sugar to cut down on the acidity. I also used crushed instead of diced tomatoes.

This made for a very rich and tasty sauce. I had to resist adding extra liquid as I usually don't make a sauce this thick. I also had to resist adding cayenne, which we usually include.
My only changes were adding a finely diced zucchini and a handful of mushrooms, chopped finely, as well, so they pretty much just disappeared in the sauce. I used half a red pepper and half of a yellow pepper.  We limit our red meat and fat intake, so I used only a quarter pound of beef (from a frozen patty). And I may have used a tad less black pepper.
It came out really good and better than when I just wing it, so I will be using this as a nice base recipe for future sauces.

I have always made my own sauce, but it has never turned out consistently.  I decided to give this a try.  I was a bit concerned about the small amount of seasonings and that it wouldn't be flavorful enough, but that wasn't the case.  My family loved it! Even the ones who are not fans of spaghetti sauce.  The only thing I added was extra sugar, but not a whole lot.  We will definitely be making this again.  It also comes together super quick.

I made this the first time as instructed and I HAD to come back again! I've always had a problem making a good spaghetti sauce (if its good one time, its never that way again). So I finally gave up and looked for a recipe. AWESOME!  The second time I took a reviewers tip and added Worcestershire to the sauce (we love that in EVERYTHING), and then used fresh basil on top of the dried (using those squeeze tubes from the grocery store). SO GOOD!  Im keeping this one! Thanks!!!

My first attempt at making spaghetti sauce! I left out the green peppers since I don't like them. Family loved it. It was so easy. I used extra lean ground beef so I didn't have anything to drain.

This was a great recipe. I did however follow some suggestions, I added a tablespoon of sugar and used a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I like a creamier texture, but I did add a small can of whole tomatoes instead of tomato paste. I would have added mushrooms but was out. Also sauteed celery with my onions and bell pepper and added carrots with tomatoes once the meat browned. I will use this as my go to sauce from now on.

Took the suggestions of two reviewers--used crushed tomatoes instead of diced and added 2 tsp of sugar, along with a pound of sausage.  Then used it to layer ziti with cheese and a ricotta/egg mixture that was out of this world.   Will use this sauce any time spaghetti sauce is called for!!!!  Excellent, and thanks for the suggestions!

I love this spaghetti and meat sauce recipe. I was searching for a meat sauce recipe that was to simmer this is the one that I found.  I do salt my meat  after I brown it and add my bell peppers and onions after I drain the meat  other than that that's all I do.

This is a good basic recipe enough, however there are just subtle nuances that I would suggest.  The first would be the choice of meat as it relates to fat content, cut, etc.  Also, I would have browned the meat separate from the vegetables and  by the way,  I do not add green pepper, that's a variation that I don't  like.  It is strictly just a matter of taste for me.  I do however like to add sliced mushrooms if I have them, but again that's a variation, that's not considered a  basic recipe.  I also like to add the paste directly to a hot pan and just slightly brown it or carmelize it. In other words,  let the natural sweetness come out of the paste before adding the crushed tomatoes.  I do season the sauce at this time, but then after at least an hour of simmering (more for a better sauce!) then I will taste again to perhaps re-season.  Bon Appetit!

I will never use store bought spaghetti sauce ever again! I may be bias considering this is the very first time I've made spaghetti sauce homemade, but this recipe was fantastic! Changes I made was I didn't have as big as a can of diced tomatoes, i had a 16oz jar, used that and stopped simmering around 30 mins, sauce was thick by then. Also didn't have basil so i substituted parsley and from reviewers i added a heavy pinch of sugar. I'm vegetarian so I used tofu based italian sausage as well, will probably leave that out next time. Very good recipe!

Great recipe!! I followed it almost exactly, except for I couldn't get my hands on real garlic so I had to use garlic powder. Not the same but it did the trick this time around. Will try again with real garlic. That can only elevate this tasty recipe. A wonderful, hearty sauce!

I left out the bell pepper as we are not fans of them, but the sauce didn't miss them for us.  Delicious, easy, meaty sauce.  It passed the husband test and he said he'd like me to make this again, which is a true test.

I seasoned the meat with garlic salt, black pepper, a little cayenne, and season salt to taste.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  This was really good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Checked my cabinet and discovered that I didn't have any jars of marinara sauce left so I made this in a pinch. This is by far the best quick sauce recipe I've made so far! I incorporated some small chances. I used ground turkey instead of beef, added, honey, and ditched the green pepper. I would definitely recommend this recipe to others.

This is a good base recipe.  Usually when I find a recipe I always read multiple reviews to see how I can enhance "my" recipe.  I did use several modifications on this recipe.  I omitted the pepper, I did try to marinate the meat in soy sauce, worst. sugar and salt before browning and would not do that next time.  I would rather my meat taste bland than the weird taste it added to the sauce.  I also added red wine, mushrooms and parm cheese.  To my surprise the red wine added more than I expected and that was the step that finally balanced the taste.

I have made this sauce for years. I put about a cup of fresh, sliced mushrooms instead of canned, that's just my preference. I also use about 1 tbls of Italian seasoning, which gives you all of your spices combined. I also leave out the tomato paste, as it makes the sauce too sweet for me and my Hubby.  I just simmer until it is thick and the flavors meld. Yum.

I really enjoyed making this recipe, and want to underscore the great idea that Melody Yeung has given in her review, to give the ground beef a marinade.  What  a difference it makes!  I now use this marinade when making other dishes using ground beef,  such as chili and tacos.  Thank you Melody!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out absolutely delicious! I admittedly did not simmer it for an hour, so the sauce came out a bit watery because of the water from the diced tomatoes (I was so hungry and impatient hehe). So I ended up putting the stove on high and leaving it in longer (stirring occasionally) making the sauce thicker, and it tasted amazing. I will definitely be using this recipe again in the future :]!

Made it using a crockpot.  Put all of the spices and tomato sauces, paste etc in the crockpot.  Then I sautéed the garlic and onions in butter then browned the ground beef.  I drained the beef and let it simmer in a 1/2 cup of dry red wine. Poured beef wine mix into the crockpot and simmered on low for four hours.  After that I added probably about 3 TBS of butter to the crockpot. I also omitted the peppers.

I personally really liked it but my husband & kids didn't like the chunks of tomatoes.  I did use the petite diced so next time I should use the crushed can of tomatoes.  I used 2 tsp of the oregano & basil and 3 tsp of Italian seasoning.  I also browned the ground meat, drained  and then added the onions, green pepper, & garlic letting them cook until tender.   I dumped it all in crock pock to simmer the afternoon.  Yummy to me!

This was a good and easy sauce to make. I browned the meat and veg then tossed it all into my crock pot for a few hours. It tasted great and the house smelled delicious.

This is a great  basic sauce. I am feeding a crew so I had to double the recipe, and I didn't have tomato sauce, so I substituted two cans of Red Gold  tomatoes with garlic, parsley and oregano added. Then I just used my handheld puree blender and chopped it all up in the pan, including the diced tomatoes. Also, I did follow the advice of another reviewer and added about 4 TBS of sugar and at the end I put in about 1/3 cup of heavy cream. Since the tomatoes I used already had garlic, oregano and parsley, I only added a little more garlic powder, and I omitted the pepper (not a huge fan of pepper). 
I really don't like posting a bunch of adjustments to a recipe, but in this case I did so if there are others out there who find themselves without tomato sauce, or diced tomatoes, they will know you can always substitute other forms of tomatoes.  I do highly recommend the heavy cream if you have some on hand. It really help take down the tomatoey taste and gave the sauce a nice rich flavor. You could also add real butter to help achieve that. 
I have to admit, this is the first time I have ever made my own spaghetti sauce and I am definitely now a HUGE FAN...so is my family. And, this is coming from a crew who LOVES spaghetti!

This was easy & great! I doubled the recipe & added some fresh mushrooms to meat mixture about 5minutes before it was done browning. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, it all turned out great. Family loved it. Thank you for the help.

Easy and tasty recipe. I did have to add just a little bit of sugar to give it a little bit of sweetness and cut the acid, and I added mushrooms. I would definitely make this again.

I made this recipe with a side of homemade garlic bread. Family enjoyed it but a few changes needed to be made.. For starters there wasn't enough sauce based on this recipe.. But overall with my own changes it turned out well.

I really liked this! I know people hate it when you change the recipe and review, but this is how I keep track of what I did for next time, so.....
I left the onion whole for easy removal, used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, left out the garlic (though I'd use it in future), left out the bell pepper, and added a TBS sugar and 3 TBS butter. It was delicious.

Loved it.  Made as written the first time, and it was delicious.  Second time added a teaspoon of sugar, 1/4 cup of good Cabernet Sauvignon, and used red bell pepper instead of green because that's what I had on hand.  It was awesome.  Husband loved it too.  It's a perfect basic recipe which is good as written, but it's fun to add different herbs, etc. to tweak it a bit.  Try it!

I pretty much followed the recipe and it turned out great.  I don't like the bitter taste of tomato paste so I only used what I needed and added the TP a few tablespoons at a time.  I also added one tablespoon of sugar.  It was perfect.

Reading this reminded me of the spaghetti sauce my mom used to make.   Of course I got through it to the point where I was supposed to add tomato paste and only then discovered that I didn't have any.   I remembered one of mom's old tricks to 'pump up' the flavor a little - she would add a beef bullion cube and a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the pot.   It worked like a charm and I never missed the missing paste.   It's a delicious recipe!

I've tried several recipes as an alternative to using jarred sauces but never found one we liked...until now. This was really delicious and worth the extra effort compared to opening a jar. I added about 1-1/4 t teaspoon sugar because we don't like a tart sauce. I started with half the amount of diced tomatoes (I used petite) and decided not to add the rest; it was tasty and thick enough without them. I'll definitely make this again.

I was very pleased with this sauce.  I did not have tomato sauce, so I used two cans of paste and added a bit of water. I went a bit heavier on the herbs for my taste and added two tablespoons of sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes.  Very tasty.

I followed one reviewer's suggestion to add 1 tsp. sugar to reduce acidity, it was still very acidic and I had to add quite a bit more sugar to make it edible. I thought it was okay at best.   My son informed me this morning that it wasn't very good spaghetti sauce and that I should have bought jarred sauce.  Will not be making again.

I added 14 oz of crushed tomatoes to make it saucier,  only used 8 oz of tomato sauce (because that's all I had) and increased the basil and oregano to 3 tsp.  This was delicious, the whole family loved it.

I love this spaghetti sauce.  Doing the 5:2 diet pasta and sauces are off limits on fasting days, but as this is only 185 calories per serving and if you serve it over spiralized courgettes you can indulge your cravings and still stay within your daily limits.  Thank you Hanks' Mom.

It's an excellent recipe, I made it a few times without changing anything and its very nice. I did find it just a tad sour, so last time I added a little sugar and a spoon of parmesan in the sauce, and it made it a little richer and less sour, just a personal preference. Definitely a keeper. :)

this was probably some of the best spaghetti sauce I have ever had! I followed the recipe exactly except for leaving out the green peppers. It made a huge batch and it was even more delicious the second day.

I've been looking for a simple yet robust sauce to try. This is perfect! And with all the ingredients on hand, this was easy. I added 2 onions & a huge green pepper because I like my sauces zesty. i I browned the meat & veggies and then dumped everything in my crock pot with some bay leaves. I love how delicious the air is as this is simmering for 4 hours. Made no other changes. THANKS for this wonderful recipe!

I made it with modifications and it was GREAT!!! I did not use the ground beef but used frozen precooked Italian meatballs and use the green bell pepper and mushrooms.  As others commented I used Italian seasoning, dried basil and dried oregano. I used crushed tomato (28oz can) instead of the diced tomato (28oz can) listed. Plus added a pinch of sugar.

Good basic spaghetti sauce. I used hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef and added an extra can of diced tomatoes for a chunkier sauce.

This was pretty basic sauce as is. So I read other reviews and added a a little sugar,  mushrooms, pinch of crushed red pepper and a splash of heavy cream. Will probably make again.

I have never liked spaghetti.  I used this recipe for my three sons.  I love it!  It is the only spaghetti sauce that I eat.  I add mushrooms and black olives to it because we like the chunkiness of it.

Love it, love it, love it. I use crushed tomatoes instead of diced and I add Worcestershire Sauce along with some Italian Seasoning and it comes out amazing. Love the tang it has which is what I look for in a good sauce. I've made this sauce my own!

Very tasty. I used fresh herbs instead of dried and added a teaspoon of yellow sugar to cut the acidity. I served with freshly grated Parmesan. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! I use ground bison rather than beef because, as one reviewer mentioned, draining the grease removes some flavor from the onion and garlic. Bison is so lean it doesn't really require draining. I also add a bay leaf, red pepper flakes, thyme and use fire roasted diced tomatoes. Delicious!!!!

It works well.  Another nice thing to do is stir in about 3 or 4 cubic inches of melting cheese such as Velveeta.

Good basic sauce especially for a family with varied tastes   For us it is a little too bland so always add hot pepper flakes and definitely freshly grated Parmesan on top....lots of it.   Good starting recipe for a beginner and easy to make.

Made this a few times. I've never been not satisfied with how it's always turned out; delicious.
Once I used crushed tomato instead of the sauce and found it to be thicker to expectation. Not a suggestion I would make. 
I did however add red pepper flakes with the onion, green pepper and garlic to spice things a little. This worked very well.

I doubled the recipe and tripled the spices.  I had to add sugar (not sure how much), as it was way to acidic for our taste. I also used an emulsion blender to dice up the tomatoes and I even used petite diced tomatoes in the recipe.  It made it better.  Better with all the adjustments.  I think it's better the second day.  Undecided if I will keep it or keep searching.

This is so much better than store bought spaghetti sauce. I made this in a Dutch oven. I substituted a red pepper for the green pepper that was called for because that is what I had. I added 1 tsp. sugar, fresh sliced mushrooms, 1 bay leaf and threw in some dry white wine for fun.  This recipe is super easy and tastes wonderful. We served it over spaghetti squash and topped with parmesan cheese.  As stated before, this is a good basic recipe.  Add to it, experiment and have fun!

I liked it, but an hour simmering is definitely overdoing it. I think 30-40 minutes are enough, as it seems that leaving it too long turned the sauce rather bitter.

I have been using his for a while since I acquired it from this site a few months ago. This is an awesome spaghetti sauce recipe! It serves as a good base and can easily be modified to suit individual tastes.

I left out the green peppers and used onion powder in place of the onions. I also added 1tbsp of sugar and WOW. Such an amazing recipe. Definitely keeping this one around.

Recipe = Excellent! I followed the recipe to a T ... then only thing I added was a teaspoon of white sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. My family & friends loved it. I plan on adding some merlot the next time I make it again ??

This recipe is PERFECT the way it is. For a long time I would buy jar spaghetti sauce. I was looking for a change and came across this recipe. DELICIOUS. 5 stars! Wouldn't change a thing, and never going back to jar spaghetti sauce ever again.

What a great basic sauce! Will continue to use. I added 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1/3 cup of red wine, and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. We loved it! Oh, and whole wheat spaghetti noodles. Yum!

I added some chorizo sausage in just for kicks. Didn't have diced tomatoes so I used crushed tomatoes instead. Also added in an extra clove of garlic because I couldn't help myself. Delicious recipe that reminds me of a good home made spaghetti sauce!

I make this sauce all the time and my family loves it!  I use ground turkey and sometimes add a cup of chopped spinach to make it healthier.  I also add a couple teaspoons of sugar to cut the acid.

This is just a wonderful meat sauce! I will admit to adding more beef and a splash of red wine and I liked the suggestion about using "crushed" instead of "diced" tomatoes, but however you do it I think you will be very happy.

I honestly didn't make this particular recipe, I just added it for the ease of menu planning/shopping list etc. However this is EXACTLY (minus the actual measuring) how I make it myself. My hubby and 3 year old love it! I think it's so enjoyable because you get meat with every bite as opposed to having to work with meatballs.

Lacked the flavor I was looking for. Trying to be healthier, I ate mine over cooked zucchini strings. I also used ground turkey and with held the bell pepper because of a bell pepper hater in the family. Maybe the beef+noodle+peppers is the combo that made every one else rave about this. I add tons of seasoning to compensate for the blandness and some red pepper and it smelled great and tasted great for about 2 seconds then the everything floated away to a canned tomato after taste. That canned stuff on the bottom shelf for $1 had better flavor than what I built. Could try it without the changes I made, but think I will start looking for a new recipe.

Good recipe.  Easy, simple ingredient list.  I did add water to thin it out a bit.  Maybe 1/2 cup total water.  No other changes, except for this particular dinner I added jarred pasta sauce to supplement it.  I preferred the flavor of the original sauce but needed it to stretch a little farther.  It would probably feed 4-6, depending on their eating habits.

Added shredded carrots and celery to give a veggie boost. Also added 1/2 cup Merlot as simmering- gave it great body!  Will definitely make again.

I used half of the seasonings. This was too spicy for us, after the adjustments we like it.

I followed the recipe minus the green pepper, and I added a pinch of salt to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  I don't care for tomato pieces, and to me there were a bit too many for my taste in this sauce.  Next time I will use a larger can of tomato sauce and a smaller can of diced tomatoes (what I used). Overall it's a thick, rich sauce that tastes good.

This was a great base recipe for me. I made some substitutions (sauteed garlic, onion and yellow pepper in olive oil before adding Boca veggie crumbles; added 16oz of water so it would be a little thinner). Great recipe, will use again!

This was a pretty good sauce. I omitted the green pepper, upped the garlic and onion slightly and used Johnsonville Ground Italian Sausage instead of ground beef. Cooked for 5 hours on low in the slow cooker. Excellent!

Half an onion was more tha enough, omitted the green pepper and substituted crushed tomatoes due to personal preference. Even better the next day.

I like this recipe-leave out green pepper (gets mushy), add chopped carrots and cup of red wine to this one and you have a winner!!

Being I come from an old school Italian family, I NEVER thought I'd use and LOVE a recipe for meat sauce that i found online. The seasoning is perfect, no reason to alter it. This was the second time I made it. The first time I added 1 1/2 lbs of chopped meat and followed the recipe exactly except for not adding the peppers. It was delicious, but not wet enough. This time, I added a little over a lb. of chopped meat AND 4 sausage patties crumbled up while I was browning them. I used two 28 oz. cans of crushed tomatoes, one 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes and one can of tomato paste. I added about 1/3 cup of grated cheese, and was heavy handed on the spices. Served it over 1 lb of pasta with a dollop of ricotta and extra grated cheeseon each plate. I would suggest saving pasta water when draining it ( I stopped pouring out the pasta and left about 1" of pasta that wasn't drained at the bottom of the pot). That made it wet enough. I might add a little wine to it next time when cooking, but it's not totally necessary. Its so good, my family was eating the sauce alone with buttered bread!  Enjoy!

I was looking for something to cook for dinner tonight and saw this recipe. I figured I would give it a try. I just fixed it and it is YUMMY! I am not a fan of green pepper, so I left it out, but it didn't seem to take away any flavor. It was easy to prepare, fills the house with wonderful restaurant smells and it is delicious to boot. It is a keeper and I plan to fix it again and again. I say TRY IT!! I don't think you will be sorry. :)

Really Good and I am one of those people who normally will not eat Spaghetti and Meat Sauce. I used several Angus Beef Patties instead of ground beef and cut down on the recipe since it was for only two people. Very tasty.

I have been making a similar recipe for years and everyone who tastes it, loves it.  I add chopped celery and mushrooms to the sauce as well as a bay leaf and a pinch of red pepper spice.  I also use sugar to cut the acid and I make meatballs that I cook in the oven then mix into the sauce while simmering. It is delicious as spagetti sauce, but I also use it as the base for home made pizza.

I'd been  using Prego for years, but recently got bored with it and started to experiment. My family agrees that this is much better than and jar sauce we have tried!   I rinsed the ground beef in hot water and drained after it was cooked, to reduce the fat content. I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because my son would pick around the diced tomatoes (he's a picky eater), and I added a small (6 oz, maybe) can of drained, sliced mushrooms. Otherwise, I made as directed, and it was really good! Will make again. Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  If you want to add to it or delete from it then it becomes YOUR recipe.  I have been making my sauce like this for years.  Some times I add to it or leave something out.
