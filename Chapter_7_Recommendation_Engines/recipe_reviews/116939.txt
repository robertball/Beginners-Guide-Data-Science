I made this chili with a few changes for a cookoff last weekend.  I left out the mushrooms and the garlic and added a little cayenne pepper and chili powder. I replaced half the beef with sausage.  The best chili I've ever had.  To be honest I picked this recipe because Agnes is from WV the same as me.  Definitely try it out!!

This is my family's favorite chili recipe!  With having younger children, we use a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of green chilies, separately, as we have found that combination less spicy than the diced tomatoes with chilies.  Enjoy!

I threw mine in the crockpot for about 6 hours on low. We didn't have any leftovers.

I cooked this for the family and loved it. The only change I made was I added 2 tablespoons of taco bell mild taco sauce. I will definately cook this again.

Delicious chili! It was even an eye-pleaser :) Most chilis are a hot mess of meat and beans, but this one was just as pretty to look at as it was good to eat :)

Good.  Nothing more spectacular than other chilis I've made.  But a good recipe nonetheless.  My family neither raved or complained.  More of a staple recipe.
