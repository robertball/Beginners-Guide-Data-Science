I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was. I was expecting slimy. It wasn't, at all.
I made it the night before and left it in the fridge. The next day, cold, it was good. I admit, I heated it for a few seconds in the microwave to take off the nip (It's snowing outside, so cut me some slack :-) Warmed a bit, the banana cinnamon flavor really jumps at you and the chia seeds still give that bit of crunch. Don't think this is like tapioca pearls, it's not. Oh yeah, I added a drop of vanilla. Thank you Raw_Angel for convincing me to eat this.

this is a delicious recipe and I have made it 3 times and each time just as good as the last. If u want it to be thicker and more 'porridge like' I would definitely leave it over night, it loses its colour a bit if u do, but still tastes just as good :)

I just ate it as is and it was good.  I did put it in the fridge overnight though.  I’d definitely make this again.

I needed something "different" for my breakfast and came across this.  I had read the reviews and decided to make it the night before and leave in the fridge. Good thing I did!  The night I made it, it was very soupy.  after sitting in the fridge over night it was nice, thick and creamy :). Will make often!!

I added organic coconut shavings and dried cherries (no blueberries on hand).  I also used organic rice milk because I’m not a fan of almond milk. Was yummy! Will make again! 5 stars for ease, minimal ingredients, and taste!

I used this as a base recipe for a meal replacement smoothie. I added 1 tbl of sunbutter (sunflower seed), 2 tbl of raw oatmeal and 1 scoop of whey powder.
