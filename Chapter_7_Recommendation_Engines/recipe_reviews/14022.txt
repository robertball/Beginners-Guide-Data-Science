The recipe did not suggest which type of onion to use, so I used a common yellow onion.  Big mistake.  The onion completely overwhelmed the flavor of the dip.  I tried adding sugar, mayo and sour cream to cut the taste, but nothing worked. The next time I make this recipe, I will use half the required onion, use a sweet white onion, only 1 clove of garlic, and probably only 1/3 cup mayo and 1/3 cup sour cream.  The taste of the onions are still on my tongue 12 hours later, after brushing twice, rinsing with mouth wash twice, and eating mints. Yikes.

This is delicious dip.  It is so much better than recipes with the Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix because the ingredients are all fresh.  This is a great way to eat spinach and so healthy!

This was absolutely delicious!  The trick is to LET IT SIT!  If you try to eat it right away it tastes like mayo and sour cream.  I made it 2 days ahead and let it sit in the fridge, the flavors came together wonderfully and it was a HUGE HIT!

Good dip.  I used green onions and added a bit more salt and cummin.  This was great on whole wheat crackers.

This is a nice dip, but I'd suggest adding a little lemon or lime juice as this really brightens the dish. Also, I'd make it a day in advance: I found that the cumin flavor really comes through after the dip sat in the fridge overnight. Thanks for the recipe, jen.

This dip is creamy and thick and wonderful.  The reason I only gave 4 stars is because, even though I am an onion lover, this was way over the top.  It may have been a misprint or perhaps should have said one onion and it came out 1 cup.  But whatever, it is worth trying again in the correct proportions.  The addition of cumin is a very interesting taste.

Careful with the onion... Strong flavor in a subtle dish. Otherwise, loved it. Used fresh spinach, which I had to guess the amount. Served it on homemade crackers. Yeah!

The onion is super strong, so I would suggest half an onion, cooking the onion, or using green onion instead. The flavor is best if sitting in the fridge for a few hours, but still good for the time in the directions. It's my go-to quick spinach dip. If you want a little more flavor, add some cheese to the hot spinach before adding the rest of the ingredients.

this is so easy and so good. I had a craving for this and had all the ingrediants. Added a carrot and 1/2 onion to food processor (had no red pepper) and then mixed in. I added a bit more garlic. This will become my staple cold spinach dip recipe. Thank you!!!!

Great dip for tailgating or a crowd. I substituted cumin for garlic (dietary restriction) and it was still flavorful. Be sure to completely thaw and drain, otherwise the dip can become watery.

Very tasty and has lots of spinach. I found there was too much onion and reduced it to a 1/2 cup chopped onion, no cumin or red peppers. That’s what I found made it taste really good.

I love this dip.  It's a nice departure from the artichoke and cheese spinach dips.  I use green onions with this as I find the mild flavor is delicious with the spinach.  I also like to drain and touch chop a can of sliced water chestnuts to add for some crunch.  Celery would also work but may alter the flavor profile some.  I took this for a work potluck and the bowl was scraped clean!!  I have also successfully made this using vegan sour cream and mayo for family that had dietary restrictions and they asked for the recipe.  I have also added sun dried tomatoes to it for a fun twist and it was delicious.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!  It a fav for me!!

I love this recipe, though I make a lot of changes.  I sautée the onion and bell peppers, otherwise their flavors drown out the flavor of the spinach.  I also use less mayonnaise and sour cream to make it healthier; I use about 1/4 -1/3 cups each.  I double the amount of cumin and will sometimes add a 1/2 cup of any shredded or grated white cheese.

I use grated carrot instead of red bell pepper and also add chopped  water chestnuts for crunch.  Everyone who has tasted this LOVES it!  Garlic is strong so be prepared or tweak for your own taste.

Yummy with Fritos scoops.

I wanted to like it because it didn't have any 'packaged' ingredients, and the cumin was a win, but otherwise it seemed bland, flavorless and watery.  I don't know enough to know what it needed, but it needed something...maybe cream cheese?  I used full garlic and onion...recipe as given, no changes, but again, it needs some.

I made this recipe for a halloween party and it turned out great! I did add a tablespoon of minced garlic; we are huge fans of garlic, and it turned out fantastic. Thank you for a great recipe! Will make it again for sure.

Followed this recipe exactly and must agree with the review posted by Sara on 12-19-07 that using a yellow onion in the quantity recommended was too much.  The next time I will use a milder onion and reduce the quantity to no more than 1/2 cup.

Excellent recipe I loved it very much and so did the family.  I will however, add water chestnuts to the next time that i make it.  It adds a nice crunch to it.

Mixed feelings... Kind of liked the taste, but not the texture so much. Next time will throw the onion and pimento into the food processor and add some cream cheese in order to avoid some of the "watered down" texture. I used light mayo, so that might explain the texture.
