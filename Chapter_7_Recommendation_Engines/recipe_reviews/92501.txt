This recipe did not work out for me.  The cookies were flat and hard.

Very, very good. Crunchy on the edges but soft and chewy in the center. The sugar sprinkle on the finished cookie is a nice touch but they're plenty sweet enough without rolling them in the extra sugar.

I served these at brunch the morning after Thanksgiving.  They made a huge hit.  I was even asked for the recipe.

Not a gingersnap but an excellant chewy molasses cookie, perfect and very similar to my mother's.

YUMMY

Isn't this a misnomer, calling these cookies ginger"snaps" if they are soft in the middle?  I made these with freshly milled whole grain soft winter wheat flour.  They are good, but I'm not raving about them.  I added 1 extra teaspoon of ginger hoping for a more gingering flavour but the molasses and sugar overpowered any other flavours.  I'm still looking for a really good ginger cookie recipe; I'm afraid this isn't it.

These were completely fabulous! I made mine fairly large {only had just over two dozen), which made them wonderfully soft in the centres and a lot thicker than those shown in the picture.

I added 1/4 cup more oil & 1/4 cup apple sauce.  They turned out delicious!

Chewy on the inside, with a sugary crunch on the outside, these cookies go well with a cup of tea.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband and son loved them.

These cookies were the greatest!  Had searched for a recipe using oil & found these to be delicious & each one turned out perfect in appearance.  Did make two changes after the first batch.  Found that it worked better to chill the dough for a little while & to bake the cookies at 350 degrees instead of 375.  Also, I made sure that I didn't overbake them.
