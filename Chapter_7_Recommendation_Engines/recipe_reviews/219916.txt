I nearly passed this by because for some reason potatoes and tuna didn't sound that great. I love tuna though, so I thought I'd add this to my list of new attempts...(bein' used to noodles or biscuits instead of potatoes) :o). I have to say, I'm glad I made this. It took a little longer than the few minutes for the cream mixture to thicken, and you must be a speedy preparer, Janet, but in the end, it was very tasty, and my husband loved it, too!  I walked my dog and came home to a lovely aroma in the house. I added a picture because it was worth it!  Thanks for posting this, janet7th! I'll definitely make it again!

This was so simple to make and very enjoyable. The cracker topping was a nice touch.

Very good!  Followed as is and was tasty.  Needed more seasoning, added extra garlic, etc.  Pretty time consuming though, and a big mess was made because of seperate pans, pots, etc.   Would recommend.  ***Does not keep well....mushy and gross a day or two later.....eat leftovers quick!

For me it was just ok.  I needed to add a lot of salt and then added some hot sauce for more flavor.  I think I would just prefer a normal tuna casserole w noodles... sorry!

This was a nice change from regular tuna casserole my kids liked it a lot. My only complaint - not sure the extra time was justified since regular tuna casserole is easier and just as tasty, but this is a good alternative

Unfortunately, this recipe did not work for me.  It did not thicken up and was more like a soup (I announced to my family it was soup for dinner and we ate it in bowls with spoons).  The flavour was nice, but the texture was too liquid.  If I tried it again, I'd definitely add more flour to the white sauce.

Quite good! The family enjoyed it. I thought it was going to be a little runny, so I added maybe 1/4 cup or more of cheese to the white sauce to thicken it up. I may add a bit more flour next time instead of cheese, but it was still very good. 
Thanks!

I MAKE TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE WITH TATER TOTS AND MY FAMILY LOVES IT.   ONE POT MEAL AND CLEAN UP IS GREAT 

I TAKE 2 CANS OF CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP AND 1 CAN OF CREAM OF CELERY SOUP   

1 BAG OF NOODLES I PREFER WIDE NOODLES

3 CANS OF MILK

2 CANS OF LOW SODIUM TUNA IN WATER WHICH I DRAIN 

8 TO 10 SLICES OF AMERICAN CHEESE BROKEN UP INTO LITTLE PIECES  

CAN OF MUSHROOMS 

SET OVEN FOR 375 

PUT ALL THE INGREDIENTS INTO A 6 QUART CASSEROLE

ADD THE COOKED NOODLES TO THE SOUP MIXTURE

WAIT A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO SEE IF THE NOODLES ABSORB  ALL THE LIQUID IF SO YOU CAN ADD MORE MILK UNTIL IT IS SOUPY

ON THE TOP OF THAT I PUT 4 SLICES OF AMERICAN CHEESE  

COVER THE TOP  WITH TATER TOTS 

BAKE FOR 45 MINUTES OR 1 HOUR UNTIL BUBBLY AND THE TOTS  ARE GOLDEN BROWN

Didn't have potatoes so I substituted Tater tots and used frozen mixed vegetables instead of the carrots and peas and it turned out very good! The wife loved it and my 3 year old ate a bowl full!
