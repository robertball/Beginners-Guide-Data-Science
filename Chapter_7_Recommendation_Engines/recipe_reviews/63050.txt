Awful! Soggy and despicable and waaay too lemony.  And I even used freshly squeezed Florida lemon juice.

I substituted half apple sauce for the butter in the cookie part, and it ended up not quite as crispy as I would have liked. If you want to cut the fat, I recommend you bake the cookie part for about fifteen minutes. I had to cook the custard part for 25 minutes instead of 15. (There's also no need to put melted butter in the custard, just add apple sauce.) 

Good taste though; very lemony!
