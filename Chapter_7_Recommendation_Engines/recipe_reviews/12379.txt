I decided to use this recipe after purchasing a flat of strawberries over the weekend. I made a couple of changes to it by adding two tablespoons of cornstarch, and instead of water I used a 1/4 cup of lemon juice like with all other fresh berry cobblers I've made. For the crust I used milk instead of cream so it wouldnt be as rich. I must say this is the best cobbler I have eaten in years!!! The lemon juice adds a balance to the sweetness caused by the sugar and berries. Not overpowering, not tart. This is the closest I have come in years to a recipe that was like my grandmothers. A definite REPEAT!!

Great comfort food. Delicious and easy, quickly in the oven in just minutes. Also, easily versatile for using other fruits or berries. I used half the water, and double the amount of cornstarch.  I also added a few drops of red food coloring for more vivid color. I also sprinkled the biscuit topping with demerara sugar. It worked out perfectly. Next time however, I plan to up the sugar to 1-1/2 T. and reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp. I found the topping could have been a little sweeter and at the same time I detected the salt more than I liked. All around, a delicious, homespun dessert. Loved it.

This cobbler was great! After reading the other reviews, I also cut the water to 1/2 cup and it worked just fine. I made it once with 4 cups of berries and a second time with 6 cups of berries, and both were fine. The one change I did make, is that I substituted "Splenda Granular" for all of the sugar, because my husband is a diabetic. It turned out great both times... you'd never know that it wasn't real sugar in the recipe!

Very tasty with one big change - drastically reduce the amount of liquid used over your berries. A 1/3c mix of lemon juice and water is PLENTY, with 2 tbsp of cornstarch and 1/2c sugar (as written). The berries will release natural juices on their own and provide plenty of sweet nectar with your strawberries.

I read what others have said about the cobbler being runny, but I like lots of juice and made it according to the recipe.  I think the problem is that the juice is not thick enough, so next time I will add more cornstarch.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used skim milk in the topping and it still came out fine.  I will definitely make this again.

Very easy to make! I doubled the recipe (roughly - I had 8 cups of berries instead of 6, and I decreased the water by 1/2 cup because of another review that said there was too much juice) and baked it in a 4 quart Corningwear dish. It turned out delicious and I will definately make this again! I will, however, reduce the water even more next time, maybe doubling all of the ingredients except the glaze. Even though I reduced the water by 1/2 cup, there was still quite a bit of liquid at the bottom of the dish - which would be lovely if you were serving this with ice cream becaus eyou could spoon it over the top.

I've been looking for this recipe for years! It tastes just like the one served at our local family restaurant($4.00 per serving!!) NOw I can make it at home. The topping is so delicious - I have never been able to find a recipe that tastes the same. It is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. My whole family loved it. Try it with cherry pie filling if your pressed for time!

This is AMAZING!  Perfect with fresh strawberries.  I doubled ALL ingredients with the EXCEPTION of the water...I only added 1/2 c. with 6 cups of berries, etc...and it is awfully 'juicy'!  But OH SO GOOD with Vanilla Ice Cream.  I highly recommend that you serve this with the Vanilla Ice Cream and definately spoon some of the juices over the ice cream.  My entire family (kids aged 5 to 18) all thoroughly enjoyed this.  Enjoy!!!!

I read the other reviews and decided to try this recipe with a few additions. I doubled the topping...next time I will add a little more heavy cream to make the dough a little softer. I doubled the cornstarch and kept the water the same and I used about 8 cups of strawberries. Here is what I learned: 1 this recipe only needs about 1/4 cup of water, 2 tbsp cornstarch, same amount of sugar...NOT cooked. Mix it cold and coat the strawberries. This will allow for the cornstarch mixture to thicken with the extra juice from the berries decreasing the "runny liquid". Also I increased the cooking time to about 45 minutes to allow the dough to cook all the way through. I added some Rodelle Vanilla to the dough. The topping was very good and the strawberry part was good as well. I will make this again, however will use the following: 1/4 cup lemon juice instead of water, will not cook the cornstarch/sugar/lemon juice mix. Thank you for a good recipe!

This recipe is very tasty!  The filling had a great taste, and it turned nice and pink as the cobbler baked.  I did not have the ingredients to make the crust so I made my own quick cobbler crust.  Melt 1 stick butter in casserole dish in oven.  Combine 1 cup milk, 1 cup self-rising flour, and 1 cup sugar and pour over melted butter.  Spoon fruit mixture on top.  The crust rises to the top as it bakes.

Decent recipe, but in my opinion it needs more strawberries (VERY ripe), and double the crust mixture. Also, sprinkle sugar on top of the cobbler before baking. Mine wasn't very sweet, but that could have been because the strawberries weren't too ripe...Not bad, and I'll probably try it again!

Way too much juice cooked out of the berries, but this was OK out of the oven, served warm.  The next day, it was a soggy mess, and the topping turned gooey (like raw dough).   Has the taste of old-fashioned biscuit strawberry shortcake, but I think I'll just stick with making my shortcakes and serving sliced berries on top.  Not bad, not great, and not good on day 2, unfortunately.

I made this for my Sunday dessert with one or two changes (1/2 cup of lemon juice instead of water and 2 tblspn cornstarch) according to other users and I am glad I did. I will be making this again. It is so good I ate two servings less than an hour apart...also I will make more it only had few servings left on Sunday.

Let me start by saying that Im pregnant so whenever I start craving a particular food, I just search for a recipe with that ingredient. How lucky I was to find this one in the strawberry section! The only thing I did different was used 4 c. strawberries instead of 3 because I had 2 bags of frozen berries and I didnt want to waste any, and I doubled the crust to accomodate a 2 1/2 quart dish and substituted Splenda for sugar. Other than that, followed the reciped and OH MY GOODNESS! I think I died and went to pregnant lady food heaven. I just made it, it is still bubbling hot and I sampled it and am now writing the review. My fiance just came up and asked if we could just share it out of the dish with 2 forks. He must have sampled it after I walked away from it! Yumm-O! Thanks again!

Great recipe, although I made a few changes:

1) 1/3 cup water and 2 tablespoons cornstarch, as mentioned by another reviewer; a full cup of water is unnecessary for doing the initial reduction.

2) 2 tablespoons instead of 1 tablespoon sugar for the breading dough.

3) Fully melt the butter that's added to make the dough.

Turned out perfect!

UPDATE: On a subsequent try, I found that by adding more cream to the batter so that it wasn't like a tough dough made it easier to spread over the fruit, and it turned out flakier and yummier in the result.

I was looking for a recipe to use some frozen strawberries and am I EVER glad I picked this one...I changed it to 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water and 2 T cornstarch for the strawberries and 2 T sugar and half and half (all I had on hand) for the biscuit part...the strawberry part was NOT runny but set perfectly... and the biscuit was not to sweet but not bland at all...I cooked at 375 for 45 minutes...all I can say is PERFECTO...add a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and you're in heaven...

DH loves this recipe!  He even loves it better than my strawberry pie, and that is his favorite.  I decreased the water by half, increased the cornstarch to 3 tablespoons, and added 1/2 cup lemon juice.  In addition I added a bit more sugar to the topping and sprinkled sugar on top since we like a sweeter topping.  I also increased the topping by 1/2 and the strawberries by 1/2, turned out perfect.  Will surely be making this again!

very tasty, hard not to be with fresh strawberries.  however it was very liquidy.  i had followed other people's suggestions and reduced water to 1/2 cup and doubled the rest of the recipe.  i will try tossing berries with sugar and cornstarch adn letting sit until sugar is dissolved and then proceeding.

The crumb topping for this recipe is out of this world.  I think I will try it with other types of fruit next time.  The strawberry cobbler was good although it wasn't very thick.  Maybe I should cook the sugar-cornstarch mixture a little longer next.  But overall we enjoyed it.

The taste was good but I had technical difficulties with the recipes itself.   Based on other reviews, I decreased the amount of water to 1/2 cup and it was still way to much.  Will use 1/4 in the future.  Also the dough was too dry as written had to add at least 1/2 cup more heavy cream.

This was decent but didn't blow my socks off. I used the "most helpful" review that said to sub lemon juice for the water and add more cornstarch - I do agree with that. Perhaps my strawberries just needed to be sweeter - it's not peak season so maybe it would be better in the summer when they have more flavor. I was impressed with the cobbler portion itself - it was buttery and very yummy. I'll give this another shot this summer.

Great Flavor!  Most of the time I go "a la mode" to save a so-so cobbler -- not this time.  I LOVED how the taste of the strawberries really came out because it wasn't masked with extracts and spices.  Very simple, very delicious.  I did, however, have to use a slotted spoon to leave the excess liquid behind.  I'll probably go with more berries next time and less water.  Maybe even puree a few of the berries too.  I agree with one of the other reviewers -- more like 4 or 5 servings, versus 8.  A+  Thanks Eleanor!

This was really good. I didn't have any whipping cream, so I used sour cream instead, and that worked out really well. I will most definitely make this again!

Very easy and came out well.  I probably used more strawberries than were called for it, but it was because I didn't feel like measuring (and I love strawberries).  I also used frozen strawberries because I wasn't sure when I'd be able to make it, and fresh strawberries turn quickly in my region this time of year.  I took advice from another review and only used 1/2 cup of water; at first I used the full cup, but it was so watery that I decided to cut down and try again.  I found that there was just enough liquid/juice - it was perfect.  The family loved it.

This was fantastic! I took the suggestion of halving the liquid and I added a bit more sugar to the topping and it was great.  Everyone at my 4th of July party agreed it was one of the best cobblers they have ever had!!! Thanks!

I doubled the recipe and should have reduced the water as others did.  Flavor was great, though.  I will make it again, only with less water and maybe a little more sugar.  Thanks!

Made this recipe for my family for a weekend get together.  OMG!!  So good!  Even my picky mother-in-law liked it. The only change I will make next time is to reduce the water/sugar/cornstarch combination.  The berries were so juicy that the dish was overflowing halfway through cooking.  Otherwise,  just perfect.  Really liked the shortbread-like topping.

I love the cobbler, topping has a nice crunch to it. I will be using less water next time.

I forgot to take a picture but basically it looked just like a few on here. I did not change anything except used 1/4 t. salt instead of 1/2. This was not my kind of cobbler. My aunt used to make a strawberry cobbler that was awesome. This was not it while OK I found the strawberries much too tart, not enough liquid for our liking and the biscuit like topping somewhat hard. It all comes down to preferences. I'll keep looking.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 1 and used 1/4 cup of water + 1/4 cup of lemon juice and this was PERFECTION. The topping was absolutely delicious, buttery and the perfect shade of brown. The strawberries were sweet but not overly and paired with vanilla bean ice-cream, it was big hit.

This was FANTASTIC!!  I read all the reviews and made the following changes based on those reviews.  2 tablespoons of cornstarch, juice of 1/2 lemon and water to equal 1/2 cup liquid & 4 cups of sliced strawberrys.  I cooked the sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice/water mixture until it was extremely thick and then mixed in the strawberrys.  I had to add about 1 additional tablespoon of the heavy whipping cream to get all the dry combined.  Baked it for 40 minutes at 400 degrees.  When it cooled, served with ice cream.  It was not runny at all and was delicious.  Will definately make again.

You don't typically think of making cobbler with strawberries, but this is a really nice recipe to do just that. I was looking for something simple to try out some freeze-dried strawberries I bought, and this recipe was perfect. I've made it twice.

The only thing I did differently was to rehydrate the strawberries first, and I used the excess liquid I drained off to make the glaze/sauce to which the strawberries are added. Simply delicious.

I used about four and a half cups of frozen (but thawed) strawberries, used whole milk in place of the cream and increased the topping by fifty percent.  It was good, not too sweet and easy to make.

I have made this recipe several times and found it to be very good but very runny. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the recipe except for the water which remains 1 cup. It was perfect. I also sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the crust. It is wonderful with ice cream.

This is amazing. I had 2 pints of strawberries starting to go bad so I figured I'd make something. I found this recipe and I have never had nor made strawberry cobbler before (I'm Canadian, and this seems to be a Southern dish.) I followed the reviews and used 1/3 cup of water, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 tbsp cornstarch in the strawberries and honestly it was still quite liquidy because of how ripe my strawberries were. I used 18% coffee cream in the biscuit portion and upped the sugar to almost 2 tbsp and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. It was so amazing. We topped it with vanilla greek yogurt. Hubby definitely wants this made again!!!

Edit: Just made a double batch with canned peaches in addition to the strawberries. Drained the peaches first. Wonderful decision, turned out lovely, however, I ran into the same problem as before where I didn't find the dough quite covered the fruit. It was still a good ratio of dough to fruit but if you want the dough to cover it, I would suggest doubling or 1.5x-ing the dough recipe.

The strawberry base was perfect, not too sweet - I found the cobbler portion to be too thick and plain tasting - I may try it again adding more cream or butter.

I made this recipe yesterday for a Bible study at our house.  I tripled the biscuit mixture and doubled the strawberry ingredients.  I usued 4 TBSP. cornstarch and sprinkled in little strawberry jello after I cooked the mixture.  I also used 1/4 c. lemon juice and 1/4 c. water instead of the amount listed in the recipe.  My strawberries were very ripe, so I think they made it a little juicy, but it turned out great.  Served with vanilla ice cream. The men especially loved it and wanted to know how I made it.  Everyone said that it was a keeper!

We followed Pworsley's edited version with lemon juice, milk, and a bit more corn starch. It was OUTSTANDING! I'm not really a baker; I am more of a cook really, but this was easy and fun to make on a rainy Sunday afternoon with my husband. It was not to sweet, and the cobbler topping was really lovely.

This is a delicious way to use up fresh-picked strawberries.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used 1/4 cup lemon juice in place of the water and 2 tbsp cornstarch.  Turned out perfect, loved the texture of the topping.  The kids loved it served with a little ice cream.

I made this just now.  

Substitutions:
    1) 3 T flour instead of cornstarch
    2) milk instead of cream
    3) 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup water for liquid
    4) self-rising flour instead of all purpose

Results:  

Taste is good:  Not as syruppy-sweet as most cobblers.  

Texture very good: Cutting liquid was a mistake.  No liquid to scoop out and put on top of ice cream.

Crust good:  I used self rising flour so I didn't use the baking powder.  I wish it was a bit sweeter.  Next time: double sugar in crust.

This recipe is nice because you get a nice balance of sweet and tart.  Sugar doesn't overpower everything.  I did bake it 6 minutes longer to brown it up.  It set nicely and had nice texture throughout.  I do wish I had used a full cup of water/milk.  I think a cobbler should run just a bit on the plate, not scoop out in one clump.  Mine may have set better because I used 3 T flour.  Even though, would like to see some more liquid.  But for me, the crust on a cobbler is what makes it or breaks it.  This one is a little shortcake-ish, more so than the rise-to-the-top type, which is usually tender and flaky.  Overall good.  

Next time I would:

Use the full cup liquid...1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup milk.  Use 3.5 T flour instead of cornstarch.  Double the sugar in the crust to 2 T.

This was really good! I used frozen strawberries that I picked last summer (didn't measure, but more than 3 cups) which I left whole, increased the cornstarch to 3 heaping tablespoons, cut down the sugar and water by 1/2 each and added a little lemon juice. It was syrupy, but boy, did the syrup taste good! The topping was yummy, too! I added a little extra liquid (I used almond milk as that's what I had in the fridge.) Light and fluffy~I used the amounts called for and there was plenty, even with the extra berries. Served with whipped cream, but vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt would be awesome, too!  Can't wait to make this with fresh strawberries next June!

This was great, I would only made a few changes for my preference.  I did add a bit more cornstarch because I like my filling thick not runny.  I was wondering weather to slice the strawberries or at least cut them in half, but it never said to...I would slice them for sure next time. The biscuit topping was delicious and went well with the fruit.  I didn't have heavy cream so i just used 2% milk and they turned out perfect. (without the extra fat and calories)  My kids say it needed more sugar, but I think if the strawberries were sliced it would have been a perfect amount.  I will be making this again, I might try it with different fruit, (peaches or blueberries)

This cobbler was FABULOUS!  I used berries that had been sitting in my fridge for a while and you never would have known!  I took the suggestions below and reduced the water so it was thicker and made 50% more cobbler.  I put it in a 9x17(?)" pan.  Next time I'll add more berries to it.  I'm DEFINITELY making this again!

This got us four servings. Absolutely delicious---everyone loved it! The syrup tasted like strawberry jam, and the dough was heavenly. It was a tad crumbly with the amount of whipping cream, so I added just a tad more. Then I put bits of the dough on top and cooked for a few minutes. when it was soft I spread it even with a spatula. absolutely heavenly. The perfect mixture of dough sweetness and fruit. Mmm.

So yummy! Tastes like biscuits with strawberry jelly. Very good and comforting on a cold night. Delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I cut the water down by half and added the juice from half a lemon. This is a keeper!

I cut the berries in half b/c they were so huge (fresh from the field in Plant City).  Used Splenda in the sauce and about 5 c. of berries.  I was afraid that I didn't have enough dough to cover, but it raised up really nicely to cover the berries.  Very good!  A nice change from shortcake.

Good recipe, although the name is somewhat misleading.  I would call this more a modified strawberry shortcake than a cobbler.  I did use lemon juice (1/4 cup) instead of water in this recipe.

Amazingly delicious. The syrup/strawberry mixture will seem too sweet before baking, which concerned me at first. But the finished product is perfectly balanced between tart and sweet. It is a bit runnier than I would like, but it still tastes heavenly. The crust is good as well, but there could be a little bit more, for my tastes anyway. Overall, AWESOME!

Way to runny.  Even cut down water to 1/2 cup and still way way to runny!  The topping and the sauce needs alot more sugar. Took one bit and spit it out.

Excellent easy recipe.  Took only about 10mins. to prepare and had all of the ingredients on hand since most are commonly found in all kitchens.  Tasted wonderful with whipped topping. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was great!  I used a 9X13 (3QT) dish.  I trippled the topping and doubled the berries and syrup part.  I also used 1/2 cup of lemon juice instead of water.  Had to cook atleast 45 minutes. Was great!  Would make again.

delicious! I have never made a cobbler before but by my husband's request I made him this one.  The only change I made was the crust but the filling turned out great!  Thank you so much for a great recipe that we will be enjoying time and time again!

I am a diabetic, with a bad sweet tooth, I made this with Splenda, sauce thickened up nicely, used Splenda in the dough as well. The finished product was a little runny as some of the other folks had experienced but the finished product was just as good as one made with real sugar I had tried several years ago. Thumbs up from me!

This was so good! Strawberries were on sale at the market so I bought a few pounds and tried this recipe. I did change a few things -- I used 3 lbs of strawberries. I used 1/4 c. lemon juice instead of the water to add a little tartness -- strawberries have such a high water content anyway they would have been swimming if more water is added. Next time I may just toss the strawberries in the sugar and cornstarch before baking. As it was there was a good amount of strawberry juice at the bottom of the cobbler. As per other suggestions, I will double the cornstarch when I make this again because it was more juice than syrup. The dough tasted very much like buttermilk biscuit dough. I added some raw sugar on top for texture and a bit of added sweetness. I used skim milk for the dough as it is all I had on hand. My husband and I both loved it served hot with some whipped cream on top. This recipe is a keeper.

yummy idea- can't believe i've never made cobbler with strawberries before! but, i like a really buttery sugary rich topping on my cobbler, and this was more like a biscuit topping.  it turned out really yummy if that's what you're looking for!

A very good dessert. One change I did make when I made it the 2nd time was to cut the water down to a 1/2 cup b/c it can get a little runny. All in all a nice treat! ;)

Good and easy to make. The strawberries I used were quite large, so I quartered them so that they would lay better in the bottom of the baking dish. I suggest serving the cobbler warm, but it was also good cold.

Not enough cornstarch, way too runny. Was like a fruity soup underneath. Flavour was good but it just didn't come together in an appealing manner.  I would definitely add more cornstarch and reduce water next time.

Made it as written, and it was way too runny. Need to double the cornstarch, or halve the water. Also needs some lemon juice for some tartness. Guess I should've read the reviews first. All those things were mentioned.

I felt the topping was too dry and without enough flavor.  I agree with the reviewer who said the topping was too salty, and not sweet enough.  I halved the water amount, as suggested by reviews, and I added 2 tbs. lemon juice (with 2 tb. less water) to the cup of water.  And the filling turned out fine.

Great and easy cobbler recipe. I would definitely recommend not using the full amount of water, instead of a cup I would do 1/2 cup (1/4c lemon juice + 1/4c water). Also I used almost 5 cups of strawberries and it was a great amount. The topping is sooo good, added a bit of vanilla but that was it. Sprinkled some sugar on top while it was baking. Everyone loved it , will make this again!

I followed others and decreased the water to 1/2 cup and it still feels like too much.  I would also double the topping, I have way too many strawberries and juice for the amount of cobbler topping.

This was ok.  We really liked the cobbler topping, but weren't crazy about the strawberry part.  Might be better with a combo of fruits.  I used 3/4 c water and 1/4 c lemon juice, and doubled the cornstarch.  Still very juicy ... Might cut by 1/4 if I try again.

After reading reviews, I used 4 cups whole strawberries (homegrown, smaller in size than grocery cartons), and 1/2 cup of water.   After putting the strawberry mixture in the buttered pan, I sprinkled lightly with cinnamon.   I had to add more cream to the topping, but that could have been variation in the flour.    It turned out golden brown and tasted fantastic!  As a long time cobbler lover, it was excellent, and easy to make!

Fantastic!  I filled my deep dish 9x13 with fresh picked berries (didn't measure but it was probable close to 8 c. or so), then made up the sauce using 1 c. lemon juice, a scant c. of sugar, and 2 T. arrowroot to thicken and mixed it with the berries right in the baking dish.  Topped with my homemade whole wheat sourdough scones dough and baked as directed.  With a dollop of home-churned vanilla bean ice cream, this dish made me the Susie Homemaker queen of the day!

I use the crust for peach cobbler, as I don't eat strawberry cobbler. Howevr, the crust needs some tweaking.  I decrease the baking powder by half so that it is not so thick.  I also add an extra tablespoon of sugar, cook for 30-35 minutes to insure doneness, and rub top of crust with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar during last 5 minutes of baking. This helps with the texture of the biscuit, also.

I really like the biscuit topping and have used it for other cobblers, as well.  I think something is a bit off in the strawberry filling.  Its a bit too sweet, and there's probably more liquid than necessary.  I'd probably cut the sugar down to 2 tbsp, and the cornstarch and water by half (or maybe even a third) next time.  The strawberries are going to release liquid, anyway. Still, its a solid start and doesn't taste bad, especially when still warm.  This recipe does not hold up well in the refrigerator for leftovers.

Delicious way to use fresh local strawberries! It was a little soupy/runny, so next time I'll try the suggestions of other reviewers. I patted out the cobbler topping to make a thin crust that covered the whole thing and sprinkled it with sugar before baking. So yummy and can't wait to make it again.

I wasn't too happy with this. It was tasty but extremely soupy. I may try to make it once more and will either cut back on the liquid or add cornstarch. The topping is sparse as written, as well. I would double it next time.

This was delicious! Besides using only half cup of water, I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone loved it! I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent! Excellent! I also only used 1/2 cup liquid (1/4 c water + 1/4 lemon juice) with the cornstarch mixture and it was perfect! Mine only took barely 20 min to bake! Yummy!!!

I did not like this. My husband thought it was ok. I did what was suggested about cutting the liquid but it was still very runny. I also had to cook it longer the crust was still doughy. Don't think I will make this again.

This was very good!!! I had doubled mine because I had 2 pints of berries. I only used a half cup of water still and used 2 tbsp. of cornstarch. Excellent. Had made this for dessert tonight and got very good ratings from all family members! Had the garlic parmesean chicken for dinner first. Which was also excellent. Thanks for a terrific recipe.!

Next time (there will be a next time) I will add another cup or more of strawberries, double the cobbler topping but not add more water.  Pretty liquidy as is. The topping was hardly enough to cover the strawberries in the baking dish. But it was reallllly good!

Followed this recipe exactly. It was very tasty and my family enjoyed it. The only change I would make is to add more strawberries. I didnt feel as if they were represented enough.

This cobbler is the best, bar none!  I served it with a scoop of ice cream, and it was a big hit.  The cream in the topping makes it so light and tender.  This is a keeper!

delicious!  with a couple mods of course. barely needed any water, splashed in some lemon juice.  seems like you can use as many strawberries as you want for this recipe.
doubled the bread topping, upped the sugar a bit because the dough was not sweet in the least and i wanted it to be a little more sweet. drizzled some honey on top of the dough. then baked for 45 minutes at 375.
perfect with some vanilla ice cream & whipped cream!

This is so good! Vanilla bean ice cream on top makes it perfect.  I made the recipe as written, but really you could substitute just about any fresh fruit and it would be just as good.

I decided to use this after going strawberry picking and needing something to do with all the strawberries.  I added extra strawberries as suggested by others but forgot to increase the flour.  The end result was pretty tasty, but not enough crust (my fault) and a little too sweet for me.  Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar.  Oh and the end result was very watery, prob the fault of the extra strawberries I added.

Fantastic! I agree with others that this is a little on the "juicy" side, but this might have to do with ripeness of one's strawberries as anything else. I used about 1/2 cup water plus 1/4 cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice, plus I added some zest from the lemons to the water/juice/sugar/cornstarch mix. without the lemon this probably would've been too sweet for our family. Crust came out wonderfully.

Very easy and yummy!  I used whole wheat flour and a touch more milk.  My advice would be to use a 2-quart dish that is deep rather than long, otherwise the topping seems a bit skimpy.

I have made this twice, the first time using a couple of suggestions by other members, such as doubling the cornstarch.  I also replaced 1/4 of the water with the juice from a freshly squeezed lemon.  The second time, rather than using fresh strawberries, I used frozen strawberries, raspberries, björnberries, and blueberries to make a berry cobbler.  I defrosted the berries first and used 1/4 cup of bottled lime juice instead of lemon that I used previously.  I also replaced some of the white flour for spelt flour to make it SLIGHTLY healthier.  It did not detract from the taste at all.  Thinking about it, I may make it again tonight!  A note about cooking times, I didn't keep it in the oven the whole time.  Make sure that the dough is evenly spread at the top, not too thick in any one place, and wait for it to turn a nice golden brown.  Should be ready by then as you should see the bubbling of the berry mixture through the dough and around the edges.

This was not to our liking. It was way too runny and the topping was crunchy on top and doughy on the bottom. I think if I made this again, I would use twice as much cornstarch to thicken, alot more sugar in dough, and cook on lower temp for 30 min. Sorry, I just had expected alot more!

My family loves just about anything made with strawberries so I had to try this :) My one complaint is that the strawberry mixture was more watery than I thought it would be and I even doubled the cornstarch. Other than that it was very good. I sprinkled sugar on top of the biscuit mixture before baking and served it with vanilla ice cream. Hubby had seconds...always a sign of approval :)

WOW! I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! My husband said, "This is definitely, hands down the best dessert you've ever made." and I have made a ton. I used a scant 1/2 c. sugar with a Tbsp. cornstarch. Next time I would use a little more cornstarch. I also added 2 cups of blueberries (which could be why I needed more cornstarch). I used 1 1/2 the ingredients for the topping (we like a lot of topping). This was fantastic! I can't wait to make it again. Yummm!

I made this once before and remembered that it was a little too sweet. Another review suggested lemon juice. PERFECT! It gave it a slightly tart and sweet taste. Oh man this was to die for. I also made the crust with milk instead of cream, like another reviewer suggested. Very good!

this recipe was terrific i used Strawberries and kiwi.  i am watching my sugar so a note to others this tranlates wonderfully to a no sugar dessert, just  use splenda instead of sugar.  I also used whole wheat flour and Low fat milk instaed of cream.  Still makes a wonderful crust.  I will make this again for sure.

I made a few changes to this recipe, based on the suggestions of other reviewers, and it turned out very good. I used four pounds of strawberries, and instead of the cup of water in the recipe, I used the juice from one lemon. I tossed the strawberries with the lemon juice, a cup of sugar (I would use a bit more next time, maybe 1.5 cups), and about two and a half tablespoon of cornstarch. I doubled all the ingredients for the topping. I baked it at 400 for 25 minutes, but 22 or 23 would have been better.

I followed other reviews by decreasing the amount of water (1/2 cup) and increasing the amount of berries (to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan).  I will continue to decrease the amount of water but next time I will double the cornstarch.  The biscuits where perfect.  Love the texture and flavor.  Just wish that the juices had been a bit thicker.  Overall a very good recipe that I will make again.

Eleanor, you have great recipes! I read all the reviews & made a few changes. I used 2 lbs. of berries, 1 c. sugar, 2 T. cornstarch, & 1 c. water. (this amount of berries is about 6 c. whole berries.) The result was still too watery & a tad sweet. (I guess my berries were sweet to begin with!) The dough I kept the same, but I had to add a lot of cream to get it to not be too stiff.) I think next time I will up the ratio of dough & use half & half. A 9x9 pan works great. The crust is yummy & I would like a little more! I would also slice the strawberries next time. YUM! I am so full right now!!!

Tried for the first time this weekend.  Wonderful recipe!  I also used only 1/2 cup of water, glad I did.  I used 4 cups of strawberries and baked it in a 9x9 inch pan. I might add 1 more cup of strawberries next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

i subed frozen strawberries for fresh by thawing them partially and marming in syrup on stove top for a min before pouring into dish. I was told it was the best strawberry cobbler that my father ever had and it is his favorite desert so this one gets 5 stars!!!

I added half the amount of water, extra cornstarch, and doubled the strawberries. It was excellent, and definitely NOT watery. We loved it!

This was my first cobbler and I loved it, almost at the whole thing in one sitting.
Way to ruin a diet but I'll be sure to make it again.

I thought this would be a good way to use up some extra strawberries since we like cobblers.  However, I just don't care for the cooked strawberries.  They seem to be too mushy for me.  I threw away the leftovers.  Guess I'll stick to strawberry preserves and pies from now on.

I followed this recipe to the "T" and WOW!! This cobbler was delicious! My family really enjoyed this. Every bite was eaten tonight, leaving us without left overs.  This recipe takes a close second to my Mom's recipe which tops my list...of course I could just be biased. :) In any case, I will be saving this recipe!

Definitely needs 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  We thought this was good, but we prefer a sweeter cobbler with a crispier crust.

I love this dish! I think the heavy cream makes all this difference. I also cut the water in half due to suggestions, and I would venture to cut even more out. The dough tasted great raw, too, but that just could be because I'm pregnant :) The finished product drizzled with cream is outstanding. I'll be making this again soon!

Never thought I could make a cobbler but Boy was this easy and so delicious. I was just about to throw out a whole big basket of strawberries that weren't too sweet then I thought to look on ALLRECIPES to make use of them. So glad I did. With this recipe strawberries have taken on a whole new meaning. I also used less water as the other readers suggested. My husband suggested trying blueberries next time. Can't see why not!!

I have made this EASY recipe twice now and I have had great reviews from all that enjoyed it. I did however reduce the water the second time because it was really watery the first time. Anyway you make it though, with all or reduced water, it is still good and will be sure to please!

A very good recipe. It's lighter than most cobbler recipes and not as sweet. I plan to try it with other fruits, as well.

I did not have whipping cream so I used Greek yogurt thinned with half and half in the biscuits.   This was wonderful, I topped each serving with a little more half and half and oh my what a treat.  My strawberries were large so they still had shape and some texture.   Easy to make.

Followed the recipe and it was wonderful.  Didn't need to change a thing.  I used large strawberries so I hulled them and cut them in half.  If I would have used medium to small strawberry, I think I would have left them whole.

Love it! Easy and straightforward enough. This was my second time making it, but this time I decided to use apples and strawberries, and added cinnamon. My first time making it I just didn't have all the ingredients, but even with my substitutes, it turned out great!

I used 1/2 cup of water as others advised and that worked well. The flour and sugar topping with baking powder was nasty tasting. A bitter flavor ruined and over powered the strawberries. I will not try again.

I made this Strawberry Cobbler Recipe using Splenda, to accommodate my Husband's dietary requirements.  It didn't turn out well, I am new to cooking with Splenda, and did not thoroughly enjoy this desert.  My husband wasn't fond of it made this way either.  I am sure that using regular sugar would have made the consistency of the dessert much nicer, and bake better.

This is a favorite for my family. I used cherry pie filling instead of strawberries. I wanted to try the cobbler portion on this dessert. Very good. Will definitely make this again using different fillings.

Turned out just as expected. The crust was delightful although a little thick. Make sure you use really fresh strawberries to get the best results.

Increased the corn starch to 2 T.  Made sourdough biscuits to complement the sweetness of the strawberries and that was a good move.

I had some strawberries and some blackberries, and I knew I needed to get rid ofthem before they wne bad. This an almost perfect recipe. I didn’t quite measure the amoutn of strawberries I had, so, I just added the blackberries  and increased amount of the remaining ingredients by half. Overall, it’s very tasty, especially with the organic vanilla ice cream. It is a bit runny, and while I may need to make a couple of minor adjustments, I’ll definintely make this again.

Delicious! I will definitely be making this again. I made this on a whim with some fresh picked strawberries that were fairly ripe. It was late and I was out of milk/cream, so I substituted with sugar free French vanilla creamer. It added great flavor!

When made with out-of-season strawberries, the dish lacks sweetness and flavor. Without this, the flavor of the biscuit is revealed, and it’s clear that the biscuit needs a little less flour, a little less salt, and a little more sugar.

Delicious - made it last night and everybody loved it.  I used a combo of raspberries, blueberries and strawberries.  Also used milk rather than heavy cream and cut the water in half.  It was so easy and so good!!

Scrumptious!  I probably ended up using 4 cups strawberries and smashing some down, consequently I could've used more cornstarch.  But not overly sweet, the real berry flavor comes through strong- I also used the Gizdich Ranch berries we picked ourselves which was even better!

The strawberry mixture was very good.  The cobbler (topping) was very flat.  I may try it again and add some baking soda to the cobbler part.  Also, I followed what others had said about adding more corn starch to the strawberry mixture.  I still needed to add more as I would have liked it even thicker.  Overall it was good and if you stick to the original recipe I would suggest eating it warm with some vanilla ice cream.

Solid easy and simple recipe.  As the most  popular review, suggested I wish I increased the cornstarch to 1 Tbs. for my dish (adjusted to 4 servings) because the sauce was rather thin. I'd also decrease the salt by half because the cobbler part was not sweet at all

Delicious! I only had a 16 oz. of strawberries, halving the recipe.  Yet, I still use only "half" amount of the "liquid" portion which was in total amount of 1/4. Like a few others, I used half of lemon juice and the other half water (1/8 cup of lemon juice and 1/8 cup of water); boiled with arrowroot (didn't have corn starch), with 1/2 cup  of sugar. Then, I added the strawberries to this mixture and put in a ceramic baking dish. 

For the dough, I put in a couple of drops of vanilla bean paste  and dotted on top of the strawberry mixture. It came out delicious! Dough/biscuit portion practically melted in my mouth.

Way too watery. Reduce liquid or make it extra thick because strawberries add to the liquid. Cobbler dough recipe is good, not too sweet and turns a nice crunchy golden brown on outside.

Wish I had read the other reviews saying to cut the water in half. It came out as strawberry soup with a topping. I would even go so far as to omit the water completely and tossed sliced strawberries with sugar and cornstarch. Would also cut down on the sugar, the strawberries are plenty sweet.

Followed others' suggestions to use lemon juice instead of water, 2 T corn starch instead of 1 T and 2% milk instead of cream.  Delish!

I macerated the strawberries overnight in the sugar and it may have drawn out more liquid as I could have used 3 T. corn starch. I also used a 1.5 qt. casserole and there was plenty of room.

This has such potential.  I made it exactly as written and, as I was in a hurry, did not read any reviews first like I usually do.   It was, as others  found, quite soupy and the biscuit part was somewhat raw on the bottoms.  The flavor was quite yummy though and I will try it again with more cornstarch in the sauce,   substitute milk for the whipping cream in the dough (to make it softer and less rich), and increasing the baking time.

I made a few changes to it by using 4 to 6 cups strawberries... love strawberries, AND adding 2 Tbsp cornstarch. Also instead of water... I used a 1/4 cup of lemon juice like all other fresh berry cobblers I've made. For the crust... I used milk instead of cream so it wouldn't be as rich.This is the best cobbler I have eaten in years! The lemon juice adds a balance to the sweetness caused by the sugar & berries. Not overpowering, not tart. Perfect!

I followed @pworsley's advice and added lemon juice. I didn't use most of that sauce though, I simply had toouch. But no love lost; this was a delicious cobbler. So light &  airy!

Making for 3rd time.  Yum.  Adjust for "12 servings" but only for dough; keep on "8" for other ingredients.  Less water and less sugar.  Thank you for the recipe.

I used this recipe mainly for the topping. I have the fruit part down pretty well on my own. I just needed a great crust for my cobblers. The way I had been making them was a little lackluster and reminded me of the "cobbler" you get at a truckstop or a sketchy BBQ shack. This solved my problem. What a fantastic crust. Light, fluffy and rich. The topping soaks up just enough of the juice. Even my 90 year old Southern Grandmother was impressed and asked that I teach her my "secret" and that is saying something! So, JJOHN32, my thanks to you for this lovely crust and my apologies for letting my Grandmother think that I this is my recipe.

OMG! My family went wild over this. I did adhere to some of the reviewers and only added 1/2 of the water. I will be making again.

Scrumptious!  Tasted like a warm strawberry pop-tart (yes, that's a good thing).  I followed others' advice and used 1/2 cup water, 2 TBS cornstarch and an extra cup of strawberries in the filling.  I also doubled the crust and used double the sugar called for in that.  Lastly, I sprinkled the top with sugar before baking.  I used an 8x8 pan and it bubbled over a bit (and I had a little extra crust dough) but it was very yummy.  My family DEVOURED it!

Well, this was just awesome.  I took other readers suggestions regarding the water and cornstarch and I added about a tablespoon of strawberry jello for color.  It still could have used a bit more cornstarch to thicken the sauce but was great anyway.  My husband loved it. So easy and delicious too.  Can't beat that.

The only reason I rated this was the strawberries have a great favor…They were very, very, VERY juicy and I added a little tapioca and didn’t do anything…The cobbler was done on top but where it met the strawberries it was raw, thank God there were no eggs in it! I think it would make a great topping for ice cream, but that’s all it would be good for! Forget the cobbler part! I did everything like the recipes said except for the tapiaco!

I made as directed except substituted 1/2 cup French Vanilla Creamer for the 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream & also used Splenda in place of sugar.  Used 3 cups fresh strawberries & 1 pint of frozen strawberries for extra sweet juice!  Topped with Strawberry Ice Cream & this was a delicious summer dessert!

This was delicious -- I was planning to make strawberry shortcake, and found this recipe instead.   I loved the juiciness of it -- topped with homemade whipped cream, it was perfect.

I thought this was ok.  The cobbler did not have a very good flavor at all.  It wasn't bad, but not something I would make again.

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!  I did decrease the water to 1/2 cup, but that is all the changes I made.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR POSTING THIS!!!  I had never heard of strawberry cobbler up until about 10 years ago when a lady I knew made it and I have never had it since.  And....WOW!!

Great flavor and easy to prepare.  I took the advice of others and increased the cornstarch to 2 tbs and used 2% milk in place of the whipping cream.  I will make this again.

Delicious.  I used frozen strawberries, increased the sugar a little, added quite a bit more cornstarch, and used lemon juice instead of water per another user's suggestion. I also sprinkled brown sugar on the top after 15 minutes. Next time I'll make more topping. My husband and I both enjoyed it and will probably eat the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow morning.  Thanks!

This is my new favorite fruit dessert. I served it over vanilla ice cream & it was loved by all of us, including our guests. I used 3 cups of strawberries & 1 cup blueberries, half the water, 1 & 1/2 T. cornstarch, a bit more sugar - And sprinkled sliced almonds & sugar on top. YUM!

I love the aroma of fresh strawberries especially when it's baking in the oven, just that I think water should be cut down as it turns out a little runny and it wasn't sweet enough.

Great recipe.  Definitely cut back on the water to 1/2 cup.  I added bluberries for a nice treat, however, I found the biscuit topping to be a little thick.  Maybe I will thin it out next time.

Good recipe.  I topped it off with whipped cream...yum! I do agree with other reviewers in terms of cutting down the amount of water and, next time, I will increase the amount of the flour mixture.  It was good and I'd like it with every bite.

I wouldn't change a thing! I did not have any heavy cream so I added a tablespoon of shortening and used 2% milk and the biscuit topping was perfect. I used frozen whole strawberries. This is perfect with vanilla ice cream because the liquid makes a great topping for the ice cream! Just like my Mamaw used to make when I was growing up!

I stuck to the recipe and it turned out really well. Any berry or berry combo would work with this. It was best warm from the oven as the topping lost its crispness with time. I like the bread part so I might double that part next time. I will make it again and try differant berries.

For some reason this turned out MUCH too salty. It was also pretty gloppy and runny. It tasted okay, but I don't think I'll be making this one again.
