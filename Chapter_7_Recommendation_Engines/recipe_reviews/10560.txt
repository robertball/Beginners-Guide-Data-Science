I mixed 2 Tbl. cinnamon with 3 Tbl. sugar for my rolling mixture.  I also replaced 3/4 tsp. cardamom with 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I divided the recipe in half and only added 2 cups of flour and an extra egg white.  I baked for only 8 minutes.

These cookies were really good.  They're not your traditional sugar cookie, they're more soft and puffy.  My whole family really enjoyed these.

I didn't have any cardamom, so I substituted it with a bit of cinnamon and an even smaller bit of nutmeg, plus a sprinkle of vanilla extract because I was feeling adventurous. I bet that the original recipe would be better, but my changes gave the cookie an exotic flavor.

These cookies were more like a snickerdoodle with cardamom instead of cinnamon.  They tasted good but not so good that I want to make them again.  The recipe makes a lot so I would half the recipe if you have never tried them before.

Verry good, soft cookies. The only thing was that they could have used a bit more sugar and I added cin.

I made this recipe for Christmas to make large santa cookies... I used pure vanilla extract (1tsp) instead of cardamom... it yielded 20 santas... very good with the vanilla buttercream frosting that I got from taste of home (2009).

Nice and soft.  Kids loved them.  They seem to be missing something though.  Perhaps adding 1/2 tsp. of salt would help the flavor.

Although they were tasty, they are not suitable for frosty because of their very cake-y texture. I halved the recipe and that was plenty, and only did 1/3 of that with the cardamom mixture (i used cinnamon). The rest with sugar tasted a lot better, in my opinion. The cinnamon batch tasted like a poor man's snickerdoodle.

These cookies were good straight out of the oven but once they cooled nobody liked them.  We didn't try reheating them in the microwave, but after trying them cold we had no desire to.  I wouldn't make these again.

These are pretty tastey and have a great texture.  I do think next time I might add salt and/or vanilla as another reviewer suggested.  The taste of these cookies as the recipe is written is very subtle.

Very delicious.  I halved the recipe, added vanilla because I didn't have any cardamom, and rolled the cookies in sugar before baking.  It made plenty, and the other people in my dorm absolutely loved them.

These were very soft and puffy. I ran out of butter and used shortening, instead. The cardamom is a nice touch. I will make these this holiday for cut-outs.

Very good and light cookie.  It's sweet but lightly so.  I don't like extremely sweet cookies.  I loved the tasty touch that the cardomom gives it.  It's one of those tastes that if you didn't know what the ingredient was, you would say there is something really good that I can't quite put my finger on...  I think I will try it next time with a bit of lemon.  I think they would be awesome with some lemon.  
I would recommend that if you intend to mix them entirely with a mixer, have someone around and take turns.  I wore my arms out mixing!

I halved the recipe so I could try it without wasting ingredients.  I like it and could see myself making a small batch again because of the flavor, but not because I've found the perfect sugar cookie recipe - because this isn't it.

This is a great cookie.  It was easy to make too.  I used sprinkles instead of the sugar mixture.  They are very festive and yummy.

Love this recipe! I didn't use the cardamom I used vanilla extract. They are soft and have that "puff". I also felt like it was firm enough to use right after I made the dough instead of chilling it.

I didn't use the cardomom, I used vanilla ext. and orange ext.and colored them. I did have to add more milk, just to mix it, which took a long time, there's allot to work with here. But overall, they came out good. I'd make them again using more flavoring, they need allot. Nice soft sugar cookie. There soft only in tupperware containers, right out of the oven. After eating a few, you can get the taste, and a sugar cookie it is!

these cookies taste good! a lot of flour though. i would probably add less if i make these again. i had to add almost a full cup of milk, instead of the suggested 1/2 cup. these are killer asian sugar cookies! the didn't puff up or flatten out like i thought they would. it was tough to blend it all together, (hands were needed). but overall, darn tootin' good.

I had never baked with cardamom before and this was a great cookie to test the spice.  Yes, it is basically like a snickerdoodle, but still a nice change of pace from chocolate chip cookies.
