The best pizza ever.I make this one since years.Just use one can of coco cream and one can of peanut satay.The satay depends on the brand.They all taste different. I prefer dynasty.And you have to add some ( 1 - 2 tbs) cornstarch.Don't usa carrots instead green onion.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this pizza

Once to twice a month we make this pizza! Were always looking forward to it.
