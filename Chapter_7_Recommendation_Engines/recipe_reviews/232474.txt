I watched the video, read the recipe and improvised with the ingredients in my pantry.  I found this recipe because I had bought my first rack of lamb and wanted a good starter recipe.  This was it!  I browned my rack, smeared it with a mustard herb mix then made a sauce with thawed peaches that I had frozen fresh this past summer.  I would make this again and again with whatever ingredients I have on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Purchased a half rack of lamb, and used it instead of a full rack,. My husband loved it. I had rosemary on hand  frozen from my herb garden, so chopped that up along with the shallots. Onions might work as well, if shallots are not available .  Paired the lamb along with roasted red potatoes and steamed cabbage

Followed recipe and video, it was delicious... I could eat an entire rack myself, too bad I had kids to feed. Everyone loved it but I’m still hungry...

OMG these were fantastic and simple to make, for a little more of a savory flavor I added a sprig of rosemary to the sauce while they were cooking in the oven, served with oven roasted garlic cauliflower, everyone loved these and commented that lamb wasn't there favorite  meat but these were the exception.

This sauce is delicious!! Substituted lamb for pork chops and it came out perfect!  Add about 8 or 9 minutes to oven cooking time (until internal temp is 145 Farenheit).  Thanks so much!!

I have made this dish in the past and want to make it again for guests tomorrow.  How much can you prep before the guests arrive?  Can you have everything done and wait for them to be finished in the oven?  I guess I'm asking - can I do everything prior to the roasting and when ready to eat just pop them into the oven?  We usually start with a cocktail & app's then salad.  Can it sit for about 45 mins in the pre-cooked stage or will it ruin the dish completely?  Thanks.

Another winner! The blueberry sauce was a real winner. I added a bit of Splenda to the sauce along with a splash of lemon juice. 
I accompanied the lamb with orzo and green peas. The sauce paired well with them as well.

I have made this many times the only change I make is the amount of meat. For 4 servings I buy one 8 bone rack and cut it into 4 and 4 for the interlacing. Two bones per adult is actually a proper 4 oz serving of protein. Other than that I do everything exactly as the recipe states. Perfect every time. My gas stove runs hot so I also only put it in oven about 12 minutes for medium rare.

Wow. I was a bit skeptical about braising lamb over berries but this was one of the best recipes I've ever made. The lamb was cooked perfectly. Also worth trying for the sauce alone. Highly recommended.

The lamb turned out wonderfully but, I wasn't a huge fan of the blueberry sauce. I found it a bit too tart, added a bit of sugar but it was still not perfect.

I only made the sauce from this because I made a leg of lamb, but it turned out amazing. I only added a dash of sugar and a dash of pepper for seasoning toward the end for better flavor. While it was cooking, I kept tasting it and thought it would be awful, but by the time it reduced the flavor was delicious. My whole family devoured it!

Mind-blowingly DELICIOUS and super EASY. We followed the recipe exactly and cooked everything in a caste iron pan. The pan made clean up easy since there was only that 1 pan. The lamb comes out wonderful, but the sauce is the real highlight.

This was perfect and a very simple preparation. Great for our Christmas Eve company.
